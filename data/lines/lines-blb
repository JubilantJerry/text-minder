What if we got together, maybe...
show each other a few moves?
You know, I...
I have a trip to Thailand in the morning.
Sure.
Sure.
- It's a new mission.
- Of course.
It's the life of a...
I could show you something right now.
- Really?
Yeah.
- You know.
So, six nine month anniversary.
What do you think?
Well, I I have to go away again, but when I come back, we will celebrate in style.
Fantastic.
No phones necessary.
Unless you want.
I don't know what that means.
Forget I even said anything.
- What is... what is this?
- The emblem?
That's Volkoff's.
He is not afraid to advertise.
Well, I have to go debrief with Beckman and Casey, but we'll talk later?
Yeah, great.
New Buy More rules.
Slides and trap doors and the new superspy Nerd Herder, Greta.
Be still, my beating heart.
- She digs me.
I can tell.
- Morgan.
We need to get the car back.
With the creepy guy?
Okay, I'm sorry.
Again, tell me why we're here.
I mean, this menu's linked to an arms dealer?
Look, I thought the last mission was a bust, okay?
But the menu could be the link that brings us to my mom.
Maybe she was after Volkoff just like Casey and Sarah.
Okay, listen, I get the menu we get out of here quietly.
Yes, yes, quick and quiet.
There it is.
You young, oversexed, underworked kids.
You don't mess with a repo man.
Not ever!
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir, Mr. repo man, sir.
We are not here to mess with you.
We just...
Morgan, get the... get the... get the menu!
Repo man, Excuse me for one second.
I'm just going to just, very slowly...
I'm just going to kind of...
He's just reaching...
Here we go.
Perfect.
Please, this is all we want and then we're leaving.
We're out of your hair.
You want a menu, for what?
- Chinese.
- Dumplings.
Yeah?
A good place?
- No.
It's...
No.
- I like good Chinese.
Hard to find.
Hand it over.
Buddy, you remember how we got out of that jam in Tangiers?
Tangiers?
Think it'll work?
Tangiers?
What does that mean?
It means that we need to run!
Run!
RunRun!
Run!
Damn you!
I love dumplings.
It's really weird.
Most of these are just your run of the mill dishes, but a few of these I haven't even heard of before.
Which ones?
Which dishes?
For example, this.
Shimira Chicken.
Shimira.
Okay, Shimira is actually a nav system for spy subs.
This is not a menu for ordering food.
This is a menu for ordering weapons.
Why would your mom have that?
Let's call and find out.
Use your dad's encrypted phone.
Who is this?
Identify.
This is Carmichael.
I work for the Ring.
The Ring was eliminated.
We are an offshoot of the Ring.
The New Ring.
I'm the head of security.
I'll need to see your organization firsthand if we agree to work.
Then you'll have to come to Volkoff Industries in Moscow.
Moscow, Russia.
Not a problem.
The New Ring has very deep pockets.
We're going to Russia.
Okay.
I'm going to have to sell my Millennium Falcon.
And God bless you.
- Are you still ther?
- Yes, I'm here.
Just tell me when and where.
We have a jet on standby.
Okay, so we I. D. Volkoff's facility and we can take it out with a single drone strike.
Have you ever been in a long distance relationship?
No.
I either leave or they die.
I'm going to the head.
Please fasten your seat belts.
We're heading into a bit of turbulence.
Release the gas.
I'll reroute the flight to Moscow.
Moscow, Russia.
Where are we?
Desolation, frostbite.
Must be Russia.
Welcome to Volkoff Industries.
I'm glad you could finally make it.
Take a load off.
Relax.
And think about all the terrible things I will do to you.
We're pros, Marko.
Your methods won't work on us.
Remember, I work for Volkoff.
I must break you.
Remember the plan.
We have to access the Volkoff computer system to see what they have on my mom.
- Does that make sense?
- Completely.
Although I think my face is still frozen.
Hello.
We're with the Ring.
The New Ring.
This is Charles Carmichael.
I'm Michael Carmichael.
So, if you wouldn't mind...
Frigid in here, as well.
The plan was for me to be Carmichael and you to be Sven, my mute assistant.
See, here's the thing.
These people respect a beard.
And that whole assistant thing...
I don't know.
I see us more as brothers.
Is that so?
Okay, okay, fine.
What parents in their right mind would name their child Michael if their last name was Carmichael?
That's crazy.
What were your parents thinking?
What were our parents thinking?
You know.
It's what people in the movie business call improv.
Nice photo.
Good work, Walker.
Get the phone.
Former Kgb Facility
I know where the server is.
It's actually not far from where we are.
If my father's codes still work, we should be able to get in.
What do you think?
Maybe you drop a little Intersect style on these fools.
Karate chop your way in.
I will hide behind the receptionist desk.
You know, that, or we could just run really fast.
Tangiers?
Here?
Tangiers.
Exactly.
Could work.
The case.
One, two, three.
We go.
Come on.
Come on.
I almost got it.
I've never run so fast in so many layers before.
- Game time.
- Yup.
- This place is nuts.
- Yeah, it's a Cold War relic, buddy.
Dude, what is this?
Morgan, that's an EMP, so I wouldn't touch that.
- This is an EMP?
- Yes, it is.
No touching, Morgan.
Got ya.
Got ya.
Good work, Walker.
Call Beckman.
No, I can't call.
It's gonna be too loud.
I'll text Chuck.
I was texting before.
- Your phone.
- Yeah, I'm kind of busy right now.
Sarah.
- She's sexting you.
- Not now, Morgan.
Got ya.
Go on... my lady.
What does he say?
- He thinks we're sexting.
- What?
What does that even mean?
SOS.
SOS.
Skin on skin.
Yes, please.
- Come on.
- Filthy.
- He still thinks we're sexting.
- You kiss your mom with those thumbs?
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God.
Daddy likes. you're in trouble.
Daddy likes.
Someone's coming.
We're inside Volkoff.
Subbasement four.
Tell him!
Got it.
Bypassed their security.
I'm in.
Awesome.
Awesome.
Anything?
Well, there's nothing coming up with her name, but I'm checking aliases, missions my dad thought she went on or weapons she was after.
Wait a minute.
Frost.
Frost.
The Frost Queen.
My mom used to tell me a stories when I was a kid about the Frost Queen.
That can't be it.
Well, either way, let's download it and get out of here.
It's encrypted.
It's encrypted.
But I have a program that can hack it,
- and then we can download it.
Right.
- Quickly.
Wait a minute.
- Crap.
- What?
It's Sarah, but it's...
I I thought she was sexting, dude.
She's here with Casey, and they're in trouble.
Dude, what do we do?
Call Beckman.
I'll call Beckman, or CIA, or the Marines, because someone's got to save 'em.
Who's gonna save 'em?
We are.
Enough with the toes.
No one's coming.
I would love nothing more than to put bullets in both your heads.
Yeah, go ahead and do it.
Don't jabber.
Just do it.
The problem is you're not the two agents I'm looking for.
In the past six months, two CIA agents have gotten closer to Volkoff Industries than any other spy.
They're ghosts.
They expertly use public transportation to avoid being tracked.
So tell me... who are these master spies?
- No idea.
- Never seen 'em.
Morgan, this way.
Back, back, back, back, back, back, back.
- We've got them they're in the building.
- They're here.
They must have come for you.
Well, that's their first mistake.
This entire building... is a trap.
So, buddy, how rusty is your kung fu?
I haven't used it in months.
Great.
So... do you want to speak to your friend?
Chuck, what's going on?
What are you doing here?
Sarah, I know you must have a lot of questions for me right now, and I promise I will explain everything later.
Listen, you've got to flash, okay?
You've got to get out of here.
- I've heard enough.
- No, please, this is a big mistake.
He's not a spy.
- Kill them.
- No, please, no.
Well, it all seemed a bit anticlimactic.
I'm gonna tear you limb from limb from limb.
Okay, I got it.
Somebody please shoot this guy?
Hello?
Yes, who is it?
Look, you clearly have no idea who I am since you only sent ten of your men to take care of me, so let me break it down for you if you touch one hair on Sarah's head,
I will do to you what I've just done to your men.
Do you understand?
I'm coming down there right now.
Scary enough?
I'm scared.
I was scared when you...
You are not rusty at all, Chuck.
You are limber.
I suggest you start running... right about now.
Follow me.
That hurts.
I'm so out of spy shape.
What the hell are you doing here?
Saving your lives, okay?
Let's just call it that for now.
- I'm good.
- Cut me free.
I got some Russians to kill.
Not yet there's one more thing I have to do.
I'm waiting for you, and I don't like to wait.
Boss, the Americans have escaped.
Chuck, why are we here?
What, the computer?
This is what you came here for?
Look, Sarah, I have to tell you the truth.
I took over my father's search for my mom.
She's a spy, she is a spy, I I don't know.
I thought I could find her, I could save her, I could bring her home.
- You should have told me.
- You would have tried to stop me.
Of course I would have.
I don't want you to get hurt.
Sarah, I have to do this.
This is my mom, okay, I need to know the truth.
No lying that was our rule.
In all fairness, I was just, you know, keeping a secret.
I wasn't lying.
New rule no secrets, no lies.
- Starting now.
- Starting now.
Great, you've made up.
Now, how do we get out of here?
You can't get out.
This is a living building, totally automated.
The security system is activated.
If you die, you die.
That sounds ominous.
Hope the file was worth it, Chuck.
We're sitting ducks in here.
Sorry, Mom.
Chuck, what are you doing?
If I set off the EMP, it disables the building and we walk out of here.
But, Chuck, the computer.
You'll lose the file.
You might never find your mom.
Yeah, well, it's not worth losing you.
Any of you.
Yeah, we get it.
Pull the trigger.
Okay, great, great plan.
Now what?
Now we employ the best commie rifle ever invented Comrade AK 47.
Move it.
Let's go.
Let's go.
- Everybody alive?
- I'm okay, I'm okay, a little cold
- but...
- Anyone that matters?
Where's the getaway car?
Happy anniversary?
Happy anniversary.
So that's it.
That's the whole story.
Well, I'm just peeved you didn't ask us for help.
I'm sorry.
Will you help me find my mom?
Yes.
Yes, of course.
But, Chuck, you know what this means.
You're going to have to rejoin the Agency and be a spy.
I know.
The question is do we tell Beckman about my mom?
No, not yet.
Chuck, what about your sister?
What are you going to tell Ellie?
I have to tell her the truth.
I have to tell her that I am a spy.
Chuck.
Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.
That's okay.
How are you?
The interview didn't go well?
No, none of 'em, really, but there's something that I have to do, Ellie.
It's okay, Chuck.
I know.
What?
I saw the new Buy More.
Right, yeah, I did get a job there.
- Ellie, I'm not that's not what I...
- It's okay, Chuck.
It's a job.
Those are really hard to come by these days, so...
My turn.
Let's sit down.
Okay.
What's up?
I'm pregnant.
What?
Are you what, seriously?
!
I I was going to wait until Devon got home, but I,
- I saw you and I had to tell you.
- Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, I'm so, my God, I'm hugging you.
I am I did I hurt the baby?
I hurt the child.
Chuck.
Oh, my God, that's amazing.
I'm really happy right now, Chuck.
I mean, I'm starting a family a new family and you have Sarah and you're safe and... just I'm really so happy right now.
I couldn't tell her, not now.
She doesn't want me to be a spy, but our dad gave me this mission to find our mom, to know the truth.
I can't not do this.
I have to do this.
That's not being a spy, that's being a brother.
I cracked into the deep database for your mom and this is all I could find.
Look at the top of the page.
She was captured?
Yeah, and there's nothing else after that.
This whole time, Ellie and I thought that our mom left us because she didn't care about us, but she was taken.
Are you going to tell Ellie?
No.
No, not yet.
If my mom is still alive, I'm going to find her and bring her home.
Why did you bring me here?
I found out some interesting information about you.
Someone is looking for you.
Who?
Your family.
Have you told Volkoff anything?
No, I told him nothing.
That's good.
That is... very, very good.
Please.
I have a family.
So do I.
And the king was freed, and the castle was restored, and the Frost Queen returned home once more.
This time, she was a hero.
And the Frost Queen promised her children that she would never ever leave them again.
- Good story?
- I liked it.
- The prince was cool.
- Yes, he was.
Just like my little Chuck.
- Mom?
- Yeah?
Are you going away again?
Just for a few days, then right back to you and Ellie.
Good night, honey.
Love you.
Not nearly as much as I love you.
My mom was a spy.
After she disappeared, my father spent the rest of his life trying to find her.
Ellie and I thought she left us, that she just walked away, but what if we were wrong?
I need your help.
I need you to help me find my mom.
Holy cow!
I cannot belie this was beneath your house.
This is nuts!
A secret spy base.
I mean, it's got lasers and gadgets and... neatly organized files.
Listen, why don't you just tell Casey and Sarah?
Because I know what they're gonna try and do;
They're gonna try and stop me.
They cannot.
I have to find the truth, Morgan why my mom left, why she never came back.
- This is my search.
- No.
It's our search.
I'm in.
Thanks.
- Are you flexing?
- What?
No, I was just kinda...
- I'm excited.
- Okay, good, good.
I can't even tell you how much I appreciate your help on this.
But listen, one very, very, very important thing we cannot tell anyone, not a soul.
Not Sarah, not Casey, not Awesome, not Ellie.
- Not Ellie.
- I get it, I know.
You promised her you weren't gonna be a spy, you know?
So she clearly cannot know about our little rogue spy team that we're gonna start here outside of the government, secret to the spy world, team of two, army of one, highway to the danger zone, live free or die hard...
- Buddy.
- Yeah?
This is not the opening of a TV show.
This is real life.
Sarah, honey, is this the gun you were looking for?
- Yes, thank you.
- I got everything, dude.
- You ready to go?
- She's still here?
Hurry up.
Yeah?
You're the best.
Thank you so much.
- A spy mission without me.
- Couples do this all the time, right?
It's just a business trip.
- Are you okay with this?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm fine.
I'm, you know.
I' got job interviews and Morgan and I are gonna spend quality time.
He signed us up for a go cart racing league, so...
Come home soon.
I'm gonna be sick.
Come on, Walker, we got real work to do.
Like se the free world.
Enjoy your retirement, Bartowski.
What am I, what do I say?
What do we...?
- I love you.
- That's good.
I love you.
I like that.
I love you, too.
Be safe, okay?
Nothing is gonna keep me from coming back to you.
- Better not.
- Bye.
Mr. Carmichael, we're all set.
I have our tickets, cloned passports, money belts.
Let's do this.
Back in the game.
Me and you, real spies.
Sunblock.
We need sunblock.
Excuse me.
Very sorry.
Pardon me.
I knew it.
I was right.
My mom's safe house.
This is where she got all of her missions when I was a kid.
You know, speaking as the bookkeer for our int checki account, it mightave been a bit more affoable iwe started here and then traveled e world.
We, we dn't really kw about re, now did we?
- You got the code, buddy?
- Yeah.
Yeah, code, code, code.
Here you go.
And if we t second, we need to he a lile bit of a bget conversation just because...
Morga not now.
This is it.
My dad never made it this far.
Okay, Mom, where are you?
And it's not empty right?
Please tell me that it's not empty.
I don't get it.
I don't get it.
All the intel led right back here.
No.
No, no, no, there's got to be something.
There's got to be something.
There's got to be a... a... a secret compartment, you know?
Or a passageway or some clue that finally leads us to my mom.
- Yeah.
- Come on.
Come on!
Come on!
There's nothing.
Okay, so we didn't find your mom, but, maybe we found a new dumpling house, huh?
All right, I don'know.
Let's pack it up, head home.
Fuel up on some dumplings and start again from scratch, okay?
Now we can do this, you and I...
All right.
We got close this time.
I know we're going to find her.
Chuck.
Chuck Season 04 Episode 01
Talk to me, buddy, you know?
Let it out.
You want to cry?
Go for it.
I got two good shoulders.
What are we doing?
Why are we even bothering looking for my mom?
My dad ruined his life trying to find her.
She could have come back any time she wanted to, you know?
We're easy to find.
Her, not so much.
I'm done, man.
I I think I'm done.
Listen, you had to try, right?
- Don't move, Chuck.
- Get over here!
Morgan.
Morgan, Morgan.
Coming, coming.
Give me them keys.
Yeah, here you go, sir.
Here they are.
Here are your keys.
Just don't, please don't shoot me or Chuck.
Look, if this is has anything to do with my mom or or Albania or Tangiers,
- or that that cafe in Budapest which was...
- Oh, that was not even...
Anyway, the point is we have explanations for all of that.
What are you talking about?
I'm here for the car.
I'm a repo man!
- Repo man.
Morgan?
- Right.
- We haven't made a payment in four months.
- The car cost $900.
Yeah, but we're $43,000 in debt.
I was gonna..
- What?
What?
43 what?
- $43,000 debt, and that's... that's above the CIA money you had saved up because being a spy, apparently is really expensive.
Why didn't you... why didn't you tell me?
- Well, you were so busy looking for your mom...
- Enough chitchat.
Get away from that car.
Just, Chuck, give him a little, you know what I mean, Intersect style.
I don't do kung fu anymore, buddy.
You got some chop socky, boy?
No, no chop socky here, sir.
Fresh out of chop socky.
- Take the car.
- That's what I thought.
*****get a job!
Working on it.
You know, Chuck, this does not happen to real spies.
HONG KONG, CHINA
I'm cornered.
What do I do?
Use the device.
Make a move and you're dead, Marko.
Please, make a move.
I thought you said the EMP was a fake.
I was wrong.
Beautiful, isn't it?
Volkoff Industries' handheld EMP generator.
Will fry every electric circuit in a three klick radius.
Volkoff's upping the ante.
The building's elevators are knocked out.
Mr. Volkoff's agents will be here in minutes.
You're trapped.
Put down your guns.
You know, he really should be here.
Chuck's the Intersect.
We could use him on a mission like this.
I hate cracking into computer systems.
Well, he made a promise to his sister.
Chuck doesn't want to be a spy and have to lie about it, too.
Your boyfriend needs some big boy pants.
He's a spy, he's good at it.
- I know, Casey.
You miss him, too.
- What?
I don't miss him.
♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪
- by the way, good idea to bring the chutes.
- Thank you.
Yes.
Nice.
I like this.
But I less back.
Maybe just kind of a...
Hold that.
Hold that.
Right there, this whole sleepy confusion thing.
- That's digital sex right there, my friend.
- Morgan, what are you doing?
I'm putting the spark back in your relationship, dude.
Trust me.
- Sarah's going to love these.
- What?
Good.
Yeah.
Actually, if you don't mind, I'll hit the peck deck a little bit.
And put baby oil, please.
Lube it up.
- What?
Ba ba...
What?
No, no, no.
- Lube it up.
Grease it up.
- Whatever you're doing, please stop.
- Okay.
Okay.
I know you're down about your mom, Chuck.
Let's you and I have a little talk right now, man to man.
Okay.
Okay.
Man to man talk.
What are you doing in my room with baby oil?
More importantly, you and Sarah, okay?
'Cause every morning you're waking up missing her, acting like a sad sack.
I mean, I I understand a little bit, you know, you're you're stuck in this long distance relationship right now that's short on intimacy.
That's okay.
It's all right.
But what you need to do is open your mind to what sex truly is.
It's sexting.
Short for sext writing.
It's intimacy for people in your situation.
Sexting.
Sex... sexting.
- Sexting.
- Sexting.
Buddy.
Now that the terrible ids are t of the way, I told Ellie about the job hunt, and she's already lined up five interviews for today.
Okay.
I'll grab our bus passes.
But, remember, sexting?
Yeah, sex talk?
No, not going to happen.
Good luck on the job hunt.
Fine.
Do it myself.
Vandalay Industries I am so glad you could come in.
You know, with a like this and a degree from Stanford, it's astounding you haven't been snatched up already.
Snatch me up.
I'm 100% snatchable.
I'm sorry, I don't use the word snatch very often for a myriad of reasons.
Relax.
Why are you so nervous?
you know, I'm not normally.
I I'm normally...
I'm normally a smooth operator.
Like Sade.
But..
Today has been a strange, day of interviews.
Really?
Well, how?
Well, for starters, have you ever had anyone fall asleep in an interview?
Just after that, the person sitting in your position got a little ill.
Just after that, the interviewer started going into convulsions...
The last interview I just came from, they they told me they were going for a cup of coffee, and then they never came back.
I mean, how long does it take to get coffee?
- That's really crazy.
- Yeah.
Well, I think, Chuck, that I have some good news for you.
- Good.
- Yeah.
How would you like to join...?
I thought I told them to hold my calls.
I I...
I...
I don't think it's a good idea for you to answer that.
Hello.
Yes.
It's about you.
What?
Is... is everything okay?
What's happening?
Who is that?
Unfortunately, Mr. Bartowski, the position's been filled.
What's happening?
Who was that?
And I'm going to have security escort you from the building.
Wait.
I'm s...
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Hang on a second.
What did I do?
Who was that on the phone?
Perhaps I could explain whatever the situation is.
Gentlemen, this is completely uncalled for.
Look on the bright side, Chuck.
The bus has much more legroom than the hatchback.
- There's a conspiracy against me.
- I don't know.
I... always feel that way after a bad interview.
Except, with me, the conspiracy has been going on a lot longer.
You know?
Like,
- kindergarten.
- Morgan, what am I supposed to do now?
These were Ellie's best leads.
Where am I going to find a job?
Well, there's... always one place.
Where?
I can't believe it's back, Chuck.
It's beautiful.
I can't believe how fast they rebuilt it.
Oh... .. my...
Lord.
Welcome to the Buy More.
We're not open yet but we are currently accepting rsums.
Are you interested?
For what?
A job.
Maybe.
What what, types of positions are available?
I'm sure the store manager can help you with that.
Have at it.
Good luck.
So nervous.
Do you want me to show you around the store?
Yes, please.
That would be delightful.
Should I hold your hand?
- No, you should not.
- Okay.
Lead on.
Hello.
My name is Chuck Bartowski, and,
- it's funny, I I used to work here.
- You still do work here.
Hello, Chuck.
Welcome back.
Beckman had kittens when I told her about the EMP.
She wants us to find out where Volkoff's building it so we can blow the place up.
Another mission?
We've been at it for months, and I haven't seen Chuck in...
- forever.
- There's something else.
Beckman wants Chuck to come down here, take a look at the EMP, see if he flashes.
Chuck is a civilian now.
We can't force him to be a spy, can we?
You might want to tell Beckman that yourself.
Chuck.
As you can see, we spared no expense recreating the Buy More.
- yeah, General, I I appreciate the tour and all...
- It's no longer simply a retail store.
It's now a full fledged CIA NSA substation.
We can patch into security cameras all over the world.
Satellite relays NORAD, NASA, Strategic Air Command.
Hit that red button, we go to DEFCON 1.
Is that, is that really the safest place to put that out in the open?
There's a new laser based security system.
General, this is crazy.
You realize this is crazy.
No, it's not.
After the success of Operation Bartowski,
- the president made you a priority.
- I beg your pardon.
The the the president president?
Like, the actual...
You're being totally serious.
General, I am out of the spy game.
You're out when I say you're out.
If memory serves, you actually said, Chuck, you are out of the spy game.
I changed my mind.
You're back.
Discussion over.
And don't think you're going to find another job.
Why...?
You... you... you.
That was you on the phone, wasn't it?
You tanked my interviews, didn't you?
- Sarah.
Back in town?
- Chuck, listen to me.
You do not have to be a spy.
No, no.
I know.
Yeah.
Beckman just offered me a position, and I turned her down.
How did she react?
Well, she...
Chuck, hello?
That went well, I think.
I'm...
I'm sorry.
I should have called, but we just got in.
No, it's fine 'cause you're here, and I'm here, and... and I miss you a lot.
I missed you, too.
- This is the mission that just won't end.
- I get it.
It's important work, okay?
But you're here now at least for a little while, right?
- Few weeks?
Days?
Hours?
Enough sap.
- Sarah, what...
- Let's take a look at the mission at hand.
Flash.
- What are you...?
Well?
Thanks, Casey.
EMP, manufactured in Venezuela at the Corta Verona facility, which is a subsidiary of Volkoff Industries.
Who's Volkoff?
Don't tell me.
Alexei Volkoff arms dealer, recluse.
He's like the Russian Howard Hughes.
We've been chasing after him for months, and with that single flash, we might just be able to take him down.
Good to have you back.
- I'm not staying.
- I think he misses you.
I know he does.
This is nuts, man.
The Buy More is being run by the CIA.
Amazing.
Which would make you a spy?
- You are very perceptive, Mr. Grimes.
- Guilty.
I got to say, the new Castle is pretty freaking sweet.
And it's nice to be back down in here with u.
- Chuck, can we talk?
- Of course.
Anytime.
About what?
Well, I know this is awkward, but,
I just have to ask about the picture.
What, what picture?
Chuck, do you want to sext with me?
No!
I don't...
I mean...
I...
No.
No, no.
No, this isn't my idea.
Cleary not my idea.
This was Morgan's doing.
Well, don't worry.
I...
I thought it was cute.
Here's the thing I don't know if you know this, but,
I actually was an agent myself for a little while last year.
What if we got together, maybe...
show each other a few moves?
You know, I...
I have a trip to Thailand in the morning.
Sure.
Sure.
- It's a new mission.
- Of course.
It's the life of a...
I could show you something right now.
- Really?
Yeah.
- You know.
So, six nine month anniversary.
What do you think?
Well, I I have to go away again, but when I come back, we will celebrate in style.
Fantastic.
No phones necessary.
Unless you want.
I don't know what that means.
Forget I even said anything.
- what is... what is this?
- The emblem?
That's Volkoff's.
He is not afraid to advertise.
Well, I have to go debrief with Beckman and Casey, but we'll talk later?
Yeah, great.
New Buy More rules.
Slides and trap doors and the new superspy Nerd Herder, Greta.
Be still, my beating heart.
- She digs me.
I can tell.
- Morgan.
We need to get the car back.
With the creepy guy?
Okay, I'm sorry.
Again, tell me why we're here.
I mean, this menu's linked to an arms dealer?
Look, I thought the last mission was a bust, okay?
But the menu could be the link that brings us to my mom.
Maybe she was after Volkoff just like Casey and Sarah.
Okay, listen, I get the menu we get out of here quietly.
Yes, yes, quick and quiet.
There it is.
You young, oversexed, underworked kids.
You don't mess with a repo man.
Not ever!
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir, Mr. repo man, sir.
We are not here to mess with you.
We just...
Morgan, get the... get the... get the menu!
Repo man, Excuse me for one second.
I'm just going to just, very slowly...
I'm just going to kind of...
He's just reaching...
Here we go.
Perfect.
Please, this is all we want and then we're leaving.
We're out of your hair.
You want a menu, for what?
- Chinese.
- Dumplings.
Yeah?
A good place?
- No.
It's...
No.
- I like good Chinese.
Hard to find.
Hand it over.
Buddy, you remember how we got out of that jam in Tangiers?
Tangiers?
Think it'll work?
Tangiers?
What does that mean?
It means that we need to run!
Run!
RunRun!
Run!
Damn you!
I love dumplings.
It's really weird.
Most of these are just your run of the mill dishes, but a few of these I haven't even heard of before.
Which ones?
Which dishes?
For example, this.
Shimira Chicken.
- Shimira.
- Okay, Shimira is actually a nav system for spy subs.
This is not a menu for ordering food.
This is a menu for ordering weapons.
Why would your mom have that?
Let's call and find out.
Use your dad's encrypted phone.
Who is this?
Identify.
This is Carmichael.
I work for the Ring.
The Ring was eliminated.
We are an offshoot of the Ring.
The New Ring.
I'm the head of security.
I'll need to see your organization firsthand if we agree to work.
Then you'll have to come to Volkoff Industries in Moscow.
Moscow, Russia.
Not a problem.
The New Ring has very deep pockets.
We're going to Russia.
Okay.
I'm going to have to sell my Millennium Falcon.
And God bless you.
- Are you still ther?
- Yes, I'm here.
Just tell me when and where.
We have a jet on standby.
Okay, so we I. D. Volkoff's facility and we can take it out with a single drone strike.
Have you ever been in a long distance relationship?
No.
I either leave or they die.
I'm going to the head.
Please fasten your seat belts.
We're heading into a bit of turbulence.
Release the gas.
I'll reroute the flight to Moscow.
Moscow, Russian.
Where are we?
Desolation, frostbite.
Must be Russia.
Welcome to Volkoff Industries.
I'm glad you could finally make it.
Take a load off.
Relax.
And think about all the terrible things I will do to you.
We're pros, Marko.
Your methods won't work on us.
Remember, I work for Volkoff.
I must break you.
Remember the plan.
We have to access the Volkoff computer system to see what they have on my mom.
- Does that make sense?
- Completely.
Although I think my face is still frozen.
Hello.
We're with the Ring.
The New Ring.
This is Charles Carmichael.
I'm Michael Carmichael.
So, if you wouldn't mind...
Frigid in here, as well.
The plan was for me to be Carmichael and you to be Sven, my mute assistant.
See, here's the thing.
These people respect a beard.
And that whole assistant thing...
I don't know.
I see us more as brothers.
Is that so?
Okay, okay, fine.
What parents in their right mind would name their child Michael if their last name was Carmichael?
That's crazy.
What were your parents thinking?
What were our parents thinking?
You know.
It's what people in the movie business call improv.
Nice photo.
Good work, Walker.
Get the phone.
Former Kgb Facility
I know where the server is.
It's actually not far from where we are.
If my father's codes still work, we should be able to get in.
What do you think?
Maybe you drop a little Intersect style on these fools.
Karate chop your way in.
I will hide behind the receptionist desk.
You know, that, or we could just run really fast.
Tangiers?
Here?
Tangiers.
Exactly.
Could work.
The case.
One, two, three.
We go.
Come on.
Come on.
I almost got it.
I've never run so fast in so many layers before.
- Game time.
- Yup.
- This place is nuts.
- Yeah, it's a Cold War relic, buddy.
Dude, what is this?
Morgan, that's an EMP, so I wouldn't touch that.
- This is an EMP?
- Yes, it is.
No touching, Morgan.
Got ya.
Got ya.
Good work, Walker.
Call Beckman.
No, I can't call.
It's gonna be too loud.
I'll text Chuck.
I was texting before.
- Your phone.
- Yeah, I'm kind of busy right now.
Sarah.
- She's sexting you.
- Not now, Morgan.
Got ya.
Go on... my lady.
What does he say?
- He thinks we're sexting.
- What?
What does that even mean?
SOS.
SOS.
Skin on skin.
Yes, please.
- come on.
- Filthy.
- He still thinks we're sexting.
- You kiss your mom with those thumbs?
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God.
Daddy likes. you're in trouble.
Daddy likes.
Someone's coming.
We're inside Volkoff.
Subbasement four.
Tell him!
Got it.
Bypassed their security.
I'm in.
Awesome.
Awesome.
Anything?
Well, there's nothing coming up with her name, but I'm checking aliases, missions my dad thought she went on or weapons she was after.
Wait a minute.
Frost.
Frost.
The Frost Queen.
My mom used to tell me a stories when I was a kid about the Frost Queen.
That can't be it.
Well, either way, let's download it and get out of here.
It's encrypted.
It's encrypted.
But I have a program that can hack it,
- and then we can download it.
Right.
- Quickly.
Wait a minute.
- crap.
- What?
It's Sarah, but it's...
I I thought she was sexting, dude.
She's here with Casey, and they're in trouble.
Dude, what do we do?
Call Beckman.
I'll call Beckman, or CIA, or the Marines, because someone's got to save 'em.
Who's gonna save 'em?
We are.
Enough with the toes.
No one's coming.
I would love nothing more than to put bullets in both your heads.
Yeah, go ahead and do it.
Don't jabber.
Just do it.
The problem is you're not the two agents I'm looking for.
In the past six months, two CIA agents have gotten closer to Volkoff Industries than any other spy.
They're ghosts.
They expertly use public transportation to avoid being tracked.
So tell me...... who are these master spies?
- No idea.
- Never seen 'em.
Morgan, this way.
Back, back, back, back, back, back, back.
- We've got them they're in the building.
- They're here.
They must have come for you.
Well, that's their first mistake.
This entire building... is a trap.
So, buddy, how rusty is your kung fu?
I haven't used it in months.
Great.
So... do you want to speak to your friend?
Chuck, what's going on?
What are you doing here?
Sarah, I know you must have a lot of questions for me right now, and I promise I will explain everything later.
Listen, you've got to flash, okay?
You've got to get out of here.
- I've heard enough.
- No, please, this is a big mistake.
He's not a spy.
- Kill them.
- No, please, no.
Well, it all seemed a bit anticlimactic.
I'm gonna tear you limb from limb from limb.
Okay, I got it.
Somebody please shoot this guy?
Hello?
Yes, who is it?
Look, you clearly have no idea who I am since you only sent ten of your men to take care of me, so let me break it down for you if you touch one hair on Sarah's head,
I will do to you what I've just done to your men.
Do you understand?
I'm coming down there right now.
Scary enough?
I'm scared.
I was scared when you...
You are not rusty at all, Chuck.
You are limber.
I suggest you start running... right about now.
Follow me.
That hurts.
I'm so out of spy shape.
What the hell are you doing here?
Saving your lives, okay?
Let's just call it that for now.
- I'm good.
- Cut me free.
I got some Russians to kill.
Not yet there's one more thing I have to do.
I'm waiting for you, and I don't like to wait.
Boss, the Americans have escaped.
Chuck, why are we here?
What, the computer?
This is what you came here for?
Look, Sarah, I have to tell you the truth.
I took over my father's search for my mom.
She's a spy, she is a spy, I I don't know.
I thought I could find her, I could save her, I could bring her home.
- You should have told me.
- You would have tried to stop me.
Of course I would have.
I don't want you to get hurt.
Sarah, I have to do this.
This is my mom, okay, I need to know the truth.
No lying that was our rule.
In all fairness, I was just, you know, keeping a secret.
I wasn't lying.
New rule no secrets, no lies.
- Starting now.
- Starting now.
Great, you've made up.
Now, how do we get out of here?
You can't get out.
This is a living building, totally automated.
The security system is activated.
If you die, you die.
That sounds ominous.
Hope the file was worth it, Chuck.
We're sitting ducks in here.
Sorry, Mom.
Chuck, what are you doing?
If I set off the EMP, it disables the building and we walk out of here.
But, Chuck, the computer.
You'll lose the file.
You might never find your mom.
Yeah, well, it's not worth losing you.
Any of you.
Yeah, we get it.
Pull the trigger.
Okay, great, great plan.
Now what?
Now we employ the best commie rifle ever invented Comrade AK 47.
Move it.
Let's go.
Let's go.
- Everybody alive?
- I'm okay, I'm okay, a little cold
- but...
- Anyone that matters?
Where's the getaway car?
Happy anniversary?
Happy anniversary.
So that's it.
That's the whole story.
Well, I'm just peeved you didn't ask us for help.
I'm sorry.
Will you help me find my mom?
Yes.
Yes, of course.
But, Chuck, you know what this means.
You're going to have to rejoin the Agency and be a spy.
I know.
The question is do we tell Beckman about my mom?
No, not yet.
Chuck, what about your sister?
What are you going to tell Ellie?
I have to tell her the truth.
I have to tell her that I am a spy.
Chuck.
Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.
That's okay.
How are you?
The interview didn't go well?
No, none of 'em, really, but there's something that I have to do, Ellie.
It's okay, Chuck.
I know.
What?
I saw the new Buy More.
Right, yeah, I did get a job there.
- Ellie, I'm not that's not what I...
- It's okay, Chuck.
It's a job.
Those are really hard to come by these days, so...
My turn.
Let's sit down.
Okay.
What's up?
I'm pregnant.
What?
Are you what, seriously?
!
I I was going to wait until Devon got home, but I,
- I saw you and I had to tell you.
- Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, I'm so, my God, I'm hugging you.
I am I did I hurt the baby?
I hurt the child.
Chuck.
Oh, my God, that's amazing.
I'm really happy right now, Chuck.
I mean, I'm starting a family a new family and you have Sarah and you're safe and... just I'm really so happy right now.
I couldn't tell her, not now.
She doesn't want me to be a spy, but our dad gave me this mission to find our mom, to know the truth.
I can't not do this.
I have to do this.
That's not being a spy, that's being a brother.
I cracked into the deep database for your mom and this is all I could find.
Look at the top of the page.
She was captured?
Yeah, and there's nothing else after that.
This whole time, Ellie and I thought that our mom left us because she didn't care about us, but she was taken.
Are you going to tell Ellie?
No.
No, not yet.
If my mom is still alive, I'm going to find her and bring her home.
Why did you bring me here?
I found out some interesting information about you.
Someone is looking for you.
Who?
Your family.
Have you told Volkoff anything?
No, I told him nothing.
That's good.
That is......very, very good.
Please.
I have a family.
So do I.
MARY: "And the king was freed, and the castle was restored and the Frost Queen returned home once more.
This time, she was a hero.
And the Frost Queen promised her children that she would never, ever leave them again."
- Good story?
- I liked it.
The prince was cool.
MARY:
Yes, he was, just like my little Chuck.
- Mom.
- Yeah?
Are you going away again?
Just for a few days, then right back to you and Ellie.
Good night, honey.
Love you.
Not nearly as much as I love you.
CHUCK:
My mom was a spy.
After she disappeared, my father spent the rest of his life trying to find her.
Ellie and I thought she left us, that she just walked away.
But what if we were wrong?
I need your help.
I need you to help me find my mom.
Holy cow.
I cannot believe this was beneath your house.
This is nuts.
A secret spy base, and it's got lasers and gadgets and neatly organized files.
Why don't you just tell Casey and Sarah?
I know they're gonna try and stop me.
They cannot.
I have to find the truth, Morgan:
Why my mom left, why she never came back.
- This is my search.
- No, it's our search.
I'm in.
- Thanks, man.
- Yeah.
- Are you flexing?
- What?
No.
- I'm just kind of excited.
- Okay, good, good.
I can't even tell you how much I appreciate your help.
But one very, very, very important thing:
We cannot tell anyone, not a soul.
Not Sarah, not Casey, not Awesome, not Ellie.
Not Ellie.
I know.
You promised her you weren't gonna be a spy.
So she clearly cannot know about our little rogue spy team here.
Outside of the government, secret to the spy world.
Team of two, army of one, highway to the danger zone, live free or die...
- Buddy.
- Yeah?
This is not the opening of a TV show.
This is real life.
- Is this the gun you were looking for?
- Yes.
Got everything, dude.
You ready to go?
[WHISPERS] She's still here?
Hurry up.
Yeah?
You're the best.
Thank you so much.
CHUCK:
Mm.
- Spy mission without me.
- Couples do this all the time, right?
It's just a business trip.
- You okay with this?
- Yeah.
Yeah, I'm fine.
Um, I got job interviews, and Morgan and I will spend quality time.
He signed us up for a go-kart racing league, so...
Come home soon.
SARAH:
Mm.
[DOOR OPENS]
Ugh, I'm gonna be sick.
Walker, we got real work to do, like save the free world.
Enjoy retirement, Bartowski.
- What am I, uh...?
What do I say?
- "I love you."
That's good, "I love you." I like that.
I love you too.
[SIGHS]
Be safe, okay?
Nothing is gonna keep me from coming back to you.
Better not.
SARAH:
Bye.
MORGAN:
Mr. Carmichael, we're all set.
I have our tickets, cloned passports, money belts.
Let's do this.
Back in the game.
Me and you, real spies.
Sunblock.
We need sunblock.
MAN:
Excuse me.
Very sorry.
- Pardon me.
- Aah!
[SIREN WAILING]
[GRUNTS]
Agh.
I knew it.
I was right.
My mom's safe house.
This is where she got all her missions when I was a kid.
Speaking as the bookkeeper for our joint account it might've been more affordable if we started here and then traveled the world.
Yeah, well, we didn't really know about here, now, did we?
- You got the code, buddy?
- Yeah.
Yeah, code, code, code.
- Here you go.
- Thanks.
Oh, uh, if we get a second, we need to have a budget conversation...
Hey, Morgan, not now.
This is it.
My dad never made it this far.
Okay, Mom, where are you?
And it's not empty, right?
Please tell me that it's not empty.
I don't get it.
I don't get it.
All the intel led right back here.
No, no, no.
There's gotta be something.
There's gotta be a...
A...
A secret compartment, you know?
Or a passageway, or some clue that finally leads us to my mom.
[BANGING]
- Yeah.
- Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
There's nothing.
Okay, so we didn't find your mom but, uh, maybe we found a new dumpling house, huh?
All right, well, I don't know.
Let's pack it up, uh, head home fuel up on some dumplings, and we start again from scratch, okay?
Now, we can do this, you and I...
[SIGHS]
All right.
- We got close this time.
- I know we're gonna find her.
Oh, Chuck.
Talk to me, buddy, you know?
Let it out.
You wanna cry, go for it.
I got two good shoulders.
What are we doing?
Why are we even bothering looking for my mom?
My dad ruined his life trying to find her.
She could've come back anytime she wanted to.
We're easy to find.
Her, not so much.
I'm done, man.
I think I'm done.
Uh, listen, we have to try, right?
[GUN COCKS]
- Don't move, Chuck.
HARRY:
Get over here.
- Morgan, Morgan, Morgan.
- Coming, coming.
HARRY:
Give me them keys.
Yeah, here you go, sir.
Here they are.
Here are your keys.
Just please don't shoot me or Chuck.
Look, if this has anything to do with my mom or Albania or Tangiers or that café in Budapest...
- That was not his fault.
- Anyway, we have explanations for them.
What are you talking about?
I'm here for the car.
I'm a repo man.
Repo man.
Morgan?
Right.
We haven't made a payment in four months.
- The car cost $900.
- Yeah, but we're $43,000 in debt.
- I was gonna...
- Wait.
What?
What?
43 what?
Thousand dollars' debt, and that's above the CIA money you had saved up.
Being a spy is really expensive.
- [STAMMERS] Why didn't you tell me?
- You were so busy looking for your mom...
All right, enough chitchat.
Get away from that car.
Uh, Chuck, give him a little...
You know what I mean?
Intersect style.
I don't do kung fu anymore.
You got some chop-socky, boy?
No.
No chop-socky here, sir.
Fresh out of chop-socky.
- Take the car.
- That's what I thought.
My advice, get a job.
Working on it.
MORGAN:
You know, Chuck, this does not happen to real spies.
I'm cornered.
What do I do?
MAN [OVER PHONE]:
Use the device.
[GUN COCKS]
SARAH:
Make a move and you're dead, Marco.
Please, make a move.
I thought you said the EMP was a fake.
- I was wrong.
MARCO:
Beautiful, isn't it?
Volkoff Industries' handheld EMP generator.
Will fry every electric circuit in a three-klick radius.
Volkoff's upping the ante.
The building elevators are knocked out.
Mr. Volkoff's agents will be here in minutes.
You're trapped.
Put down your guns.
[GRUNTS]
He really should be here.
Chuck's the Intersect.
Could use him on a mission like this.
I hate cracking into computer systems.
Well, he made a promise to his sister.
Chuck doesn't wanna be a spy and have to lie about it.
Your boyfriend needs some big-boy pants.
He's a spy, he's good at it.
I know, Casey, you miss him too.
What?
I don't miss him.
[DOOR OPENS]
Don't move.
Stay where you are.
Oh, by the way, good idea to bring the chutes.
Thank you.
[CAMERA CLICKING]
MORGAN:
Yes, nice.
I like this.
But less back.
Maybe just kind of, uh...
Hold that.
Right there, this whole sleepy confusion thing.
- That's digital sex right there.
- What are you doing?
Putting the spark back in your relationship.
Sarah's gonna love these.
Good.
Yeah.
Actually, if you don't mind, hit the peck deck a little bit.
Oh, and, uh, a little baby oil, please.
- Lube it up.
- What?
Ba...?
Ba...?
- What?
No, no, no.
- Lube it up.
- Whatever you're doing, please stop.
- Okay.
Okay.
I know you're down about your mom, Chuck.
Let's you and I have a little talk right now, man to man.
Okay.
Okay.
Man-to-man talk.
What are you doing in my room with baby oil?
More importantly, you and Sarah.
Every morning, you wake up missing her, acting like a sad sack.
I understand.
You're stuck in this long-distance relationship that's short on intimacy.
That's okay.
It's all right.
But what you need to do is open your mind to what sex truly is.
It's sexting.
Yeah, short for "sext writing."
It's intimacy for people in your situation.
Sexting.
- Sexting.
- Sexting.
- Sexting.
- Sexting.
Buddy.
The terrible ideas are out of the way.
I told Ellie about the job hunt.
She's lined up five interviews for today.
Okay.
I'll grab our bus passes.
But, uh, remember, um, sexting.
Oh, yeah, sex talk.
No, not gonna happen.
MORGAN:
Good luck on the job hunt.
Fine, I'll do it myself.
I am so glad you could come in.
You know, with a résumé like this and a degree from Stanford, it's astounding you haven't been snatched up.
Snatch me up.
I'm 100 percent snatchable.
I don't use the word "snatch" often, for a myriad of reasons.
Relax.
Why are you so nervous?
Ah...
You know, I'm not normally.
I'm normally a smooth operator.
Like Sade.
But today has been a strange, uh, day of interviews.
Really?
Well, how?
Well, for starters, um, have you ever had anyone fall asleep in an interview?
[SNORES]
Um, just after that, the person sitting in your position got a little ill.
[VOMITS]
Just after that, the interviewer started going into convulsions.
The last interview I just came from they told me they were going for a cup of coffee, and then they never came back.
I mean, how long does it take to get coffee?
- That's really crazy.
- Yeah.
Well, um, I think, Chuck, that I have some good news for you.
- Good.
- Yeah.
How would you like to join...?
[PHONE RINGING]
Oh.
I thought I told them to hold my calls.
I...
I...
Uh, I don't think it's a good idea to answer...
Hello?
Yes.
[WHISPERS] It's about you.
[IN NORMAL VOICE] What?
Is everything okay?
[INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE]
What's happening?
Who is that?
Uh...
Unfortunately, Mr. Bartowski, the position has been filled.
What's happening?
Who was that?
And I'm going to have Security escort you from the building.
Wait.
I'm...
Wait, wait, wait.
Hang on a second.
What did I do?
Who was that?
Perhaps I could explain whatever the situation is.
This is completely uncalled for.
MORGAN:
Look on the bright side, Chuck.
Bus has much more legroom than the hatchback.
- There's a conspiracy against me.
- I feel that way after a bad interview.
Except with me, the conspiracy has been going on a lot longer.
Like kindergarten.
What am I supposed to do now?
These were Ellie's best leads.
Where am I gonna find a job?
Well, there's always one place.
Where?
MORGAN:
I can't believe it's back, Chuck.
It's beautiful.
I can't believe how fast they rebuilt it.
Oh, my...
- Lord.
- Welcome to the Buy More.
We're not open yet.
But we are currently accepting résumés.
- Are you interested?
- For what?
- A job.
- Maybe.
What, uh, types of positions are available?
I'm sure the store manager can help you with that.
- Have at it.
- Good luck.
So nervous.
Do you want me to show you around?
Yes, that would be delightful.
Should I hold your hand?
- No, you should not.
- Okay, lead on.
Um...
Hello.
My name is Chuck Bartowski, and, uh, it's funny, I used to work here.
WOMAN:
You still do work here.
Hello, Chuck.
Welcome back.
Huh.
Beckman had kittens when I told her about the EMP.
She wants us to find Volkoff's building so we can blow the place up.
Another mission?
We've been at it for months.
And I haven't seen Chuck in forever.
There's something else.
Beckman wants Chuck to come here, take a look at the EMP, see if he flashes.
Well, Chuck is a civilian now.
We can't force him to be a spy, can we?
You might wanna tell Beckman that yourself.
Oh, Chuck.
As you can see, we spared no expense re-creating the Buy More.
Um, yeah, uh, general, I appreciate the tour and all...
It's no longer simply a retail store.
It's now a full-fledged CIA-NSA substation.
We can patch into security cameras all over the world.
Satellite relay, NORAD, NASA, the Joint Chiefs.
Hit that red button, we go to DEFCON 1.
[CHUCKLES]
Is that, uh, really the safest place to put that, out in the open?
- There's a laser-based security system.
- This is crazy.
- You realize this is crazy.
- No, it's not.
After the success of Operation Bartowski the president made you a priority.
I beg your pardon?
The "president" president?
Like the actual?
You...
You're...
You're being totally ser...
- I am out of the spy game.
- You're out when I say you're out.
If memory serves, you actually said, "Chuck, you are out of the spy game."
I changed my mind.
You're back, discussion over.
And don't think you're going to find another job.
Why?
You, you, you.
That was you on the phone, wasn't it?
You tanked my interviews, didn't you?
[PHONE RINGING]
Oh.
Hi, Sarah.
Back in town?
- Listen, you do not have to be a spy.
- Oh, no, no.
I know, yeah.
Beckman just offered me a position and I turned her down.
- How did she react?
- Well, she...
Whoa!
- Chuck, hello?
CHUCK:
Aah!
[SCREAMING]
[GRUNTS]
[CHUCK PANTING]
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
- That went well, I think.
- I'm sorry.
- I should have called, but we just got in.
- No, it's fine.
Because you're here and I'm here.
- And I miss you a lot.
- Mm.
[SPEAKS IN YIDDISH]
I miss you too.
- This is the mission that just won't end.
- It's important work.
But you're here now.
At least for a little while, right?
- Few weeks?
Days?
Hours?
- Okay, enough sap.
- Hey.
Sarah, what...?
- Take a look at the mission at hand.
Flash.
Ah.
Ah.
Well?
[CLEARS THROAT]
Thanks, Casey.
EMP, uh, manufactured in Venezuela, the Corta Verona facility which is a subsidiary of Volkoff Industries.
Who's Volkoff?
Don't tell me.
Alexei Volkoff.
Arms dealer, recluse.
He's like the Russian Howard Hughes.
We've been chasing after him for months.
And with that single flash, we might just be able to take him down.
- Good to have you back.
- Oh, I'm not staying.
- I think he misses you.
Misses the flash.
- Oh, I know.
[GRUMBLES]
This is nuts, man.
The Buy More is being run by the CIA.
Amazing.
Which would make you a spy, huh?
- You are very perceptive, Mr. Grimes.
- Yeah, guilty.
I gotta say, the new Castle is pretty freaking sweet.
And it's nice to be back down in here with you.
- Can we talk?
- Of course, anytime.
About what?
Well, I know this is awkward, but, um, I just have to ask about the picture.
[CHUCKLES]
What, uh...?
What picture?
- Hi-oh.
- Chuck, do you wanna sext with me?
Ah.
No, I don't...
I mean...
[CHUCKLES]
No.
No, no.
Uh, this...
This isn't my idea.
It's clearly not my idea.
This was Morgan's doing.
Don't worry.
I thought it was cute.
Here's the thing.
I don't know if you know this.
Uh, I was an agent a little while last year.
[CLEARS THROAT]
What if we got together, maybe showed each other a few moves?
You know, I have a trip to Thailand in the morning.
- Mm.
Sure, sure.
- It's a new mission.
- Oh, of course, it's the life of a...
- I could show you something right now.
- Really?
Yeah.
- You know?
Ahem.
So six/nine-month anniversary.
What do you think?
Well, I have to go away again.
But when I come back, we will celebrate in style.
Fantastic.
No phones necessary.
- Unless you want.
- No.
I don't even know what that means.
Forget I ever said that.
Hey, hey, hey, what is this?
The emblem?
That's Volkoff's.
He is not afraid to advertise.
I have to go debrief with Beckman and Casey.
- But we'll talk later?
- Yeah, great.
- Mm.
- Mm.
[ALARM RINGS]
[MORGAN SCREAMS]
[GRUNTS]
Whoa.
Whoa.
New Buy More rules.
Slides and trapdoors and the new super spy/Nerd Herder Greta.
Be still, my beating heart.
She digs me, I can tell.
- Morgan.
- Mm-hm.
We need to get the car back.
With the creepy guy?
[POLICE SIREN WAILING]
MORGAN [WHISPERS]:
Okay.
I'm sorry.
Again, tell me why we're here.
This menu is linked to an arms dealer?
Look, I thought the last mission was a bust, okay?
But the menu could be the link that brings us to my mom.
Maybe she was after Volkoff like Sarah.
Okay, I'll get the menu, we get out of here quietly.
Yes, yes, quick and quiet.
There it is.
Aah!
Whoa.
Uh...
You young, oversexed, underworked kids.
You don't mess with a repo man.
Not ever.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir, Mr. Repo-Man, sir.
We are not here to mess with you.
Morgan, get the...
- Get the menu.
Get the...
- Whoa, repo man.
- Excuse me just for one second.
- I'm gonna just very slowly...
- There we go.
- Perfect.
- This is all we want, then we're leaving.
- You want a menu?
For what?
- Chinese.
- Dumplings.
Yeah?
Good place?
- No.
No.
It's...
- No.
I wouldn't say...
I like good Chinese.
Hard to find, though.
Hand it over.
You remember how we got out of that jam in Tangiers?
- Think it'll work?
- "Tangiers." What does that mean?
It means that we need to run!
Run, run, run!
Damn you!
I love dumplings.
MORGAN:
It's really weird.
Most of these are just your run-of-the-mill dishes.
But a few of these I haven't even heard of before.
Which ones?
Which dishes?
For example, this Shimira Chicken.
Ah.
Shimira.
Okay, Shimira is actually a nav system for spy subs.
This is not a menu for ordering food.
This is a menu for ordering weapons.
Wh...?
Why would your mom have that?
- Let's call and find out.
- Use your dad's encrypted phone.
[CHUCK MUMBLES]
[PHONE RINGS]
- Ahem.
- Ahem.

This is Carmichael.
I work for The Ring.
MAN:
The Ring was eliminated.
We are an offshoot of The Ring.
The New Ring.
I'm the head of security.
I'll need to see your organization firsthand if we agree to work.
Then you have to come to Volkoff Industries in Moscow.
Moscow, Russia.
Not a problem.
The New Ring has very deep pockets.
- We're going to Russia.
- Okay.
I'm gonna have to sell my Millennium Falcon.
Then God bless you.
MAN:
Are you still there?
- Yes, I'm here.
Just tell me when and where.
We have a jet on standby.
CASEY:
Okay, so we ID Volkoff's facility and we can take it out with a single drone strike.
Have you ever been in a long-distance relationship?
No.
Ahem.
I either leave or they die.
I'm going to the head.

MARCO:
Welcome to Volkoff Industries.
Glad you could finally make it.
Take a load off, relax and think about all the terrible things that we'll do to you.
We're pros, Marco.
Your methods won't work on us.
Remember, I work for Volkoff.
I must break you.
[SHIVERING]
CHUCK:
Remember the plan.
Access the Volkoff computer system and see what they have on my mom.
- Does that make sense?
- Completely.
- Although, I think my face is still frozen.
CHUCK:
Okay.
Hello.
We're with The Ring.
The New Ring.
This is Charles Carmichael.
I'm Michael Carmichael.
So if you wouldn't mind...
Frigid in here as well.
Wow.
The plan was for me to be Carmichael and you to be Sven, my mute assistant.
Here's the thing.
These people respect a beard.
And the whole assistant thing, I see us more as brothers.
Is that so?
Okay, okay, fine.
What parents in their right mind would name their child Michael if their last name was Carmichael?
- What were your parents thinking?
- What were our parents thinking?
You know, it's what people in the movie business call improv.
MAN:
Nice photo.
[GRUNTS]
Good work, Walker.
Get the phone.
[CLEARS THROAT]
I know where the server is.
It's not far.
If my father's codes still work, we should get in.
What do you think?
Um, maybe drop a little Intersect style on these fools.
Karate chop your way in.
I will hide behind the receptionist desk.
Yeah, that, or we could just run really fast.
Tangiers?
Here?
- Tangiers, exactly.
- Ah, could work.
Pick up the case.
One, two, three.
Here we go.
Hurry up.
SARAH:
Come on.
- Come on.
- Almost got it.
[DOOR LOCKS]
Oh.
I've never run so fast in so many layers before.
- Game time.
- Yep.
- This place is nuts.
- Yeah, it's a Cold War relic, buddy.
Oh, dude.
What is this?
Morgan, that's an EMP.
So I wouldn't touch that.
- This is an EMP?
- Yes, it is.
No touching, Morgan.
Gotcha, gotcha.
CASEY:
Good work, Walker.
Call Beckman.
No, I can't call.
It's gonna be too loud.
I'll text Chuck.
I was texting before.
[PHONE BEEPS]
- Your phone.
- Yeah, I'm kind of busy right now.
I'll get it for you.
Sarah.
She's sexting you.
- Not now, Morgan.
- Gotcha.
Go on, milady.
[BEEPS]
- What does he say?
- He thinks we're sexting.
What?
What does that even mean?
[PHONE BEEPS]
"SOS." SOS.
Skin on skin.
Yes, please.
Oh, come on.
Filthy.
- He still thinks we're sexting.
- You kiss your mom with those thumbs?
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Daddy likes.
Oh, you're in trouble.
Daddy likes.
[CLANGING]
[WHISPERS] Hey, someone's coming.
[WHISPERS] We're inside Volkoff, Subbasement 4.
Tell him.
Got it.
Bypassed their security.
I'm in.
Awesome, awesome.
- Anything?
- Nothing coming up with her name.
I'm checking aliases, missions Dad thought she went on, weapons she was after.
[COMPUTER BEEPING]
Hang on.
Hang on.
Wait a minute. "Frost."
Frost.
The Frost Queen.
My mom used to tell me stories about the Frost Queen.
- That can't be it.
- Either way, let's download and get out.
It's encrypted.
It's encrypted.
But I have a program that can hack it.
- And then we can download it.
- Right.
Quickly.
[PHONE BEEPS]
Wait a minute.
Oh, crap.
- What?
- It's Sarah.
But it's...
I thought she was sexting, dude.
She's here with Casey, and they're in trouble.
What do we do?
Call Beckman.
Beckman or CIA or the Marines, because someone's gotta save them.
Who's gonna save them?
We are.
MARCO:
Enough with the toes.
No one's coming.
I would love nothing more than to put bullets in both your heads.
Yeah, go ahead and do it.
Don't jabber, just do it.
The problem is you're not the two agents I'm looking for.
In the past six months, two CIA agents have gotten closer to Volkoff Industries than any other spy.
They're ghosts.
They expertly use public transportation to avoid being tracked.
So tell me who are these master spies?
- No idea.
- Never seen them.
CHUCK:
Morgan, this way.
[GUNS COCK]
Back, back, back.
[GUNS COCK]
MAN [OVER RADIO]:
Got them.
They're in the building.
They're here.
They must have come for you.
Well, that's their first mistake.
This entire building is a trap.
So, buddy, how rusty is your kung fu?
I haven't used it in months.
Great.
So you want to speak to your friend?
SARAH:
Chuck, what's going on?
What are you doing here?
I know you must have a lot of questions, and I promise I will explain later.
You've gotta flash.
You've gotta get out.
- I've heard enough.
- This is a mistake.
He's not a spy.
- Kill them.
- No, please, no.
[GUNFIRE OVER RADIO]
Chuck?
[SCREAMS OVER RADIO]
Well, it all seemed a bit anticlimactic.
I'm gonna tear you limb from limb from limb.
Okay, I got it.
Somebody please shoot this guy.
CHUCK [OVER RADIO]:
Hello?
Yes, who is it?
CHUCK:
Look, you clearly have no idea who I am.
You only sent 10 of your men to take care of me.
So let me break it down:
If you touch one hair on Sarah's head I will do to you what I've just done to your men.
Understand?
I'm coming down there right now.
- Scary enough?
- I'm scared.
I was scared when you...
Rusty?
You're not rusty at all.
You are limber.
I suggest you start running, right about now.
Follow me.
[GRUNTS]
[GROANS]
That hurts.
I'm so out of spy shape.
What the hell are you doing here?
Saving your lives, okay?
Let's just go with that for now.
- Ahem, I'm good.
- Cut me free.
- I got some Russians to kill.
CHUCK:
Not yet.
There's one more thing I have to do.
I'm waiting for you, and I don't like to wait.
MAN [OVER RADIO]:
Boss, the Americans have escaped.
CASEY:
Chuck, why are we here?
The computer?
This is what you came here for?
Look, Sarah, I have to tell you the truth.
I took over my father's search for my mom.
She's a spy.
I thought I could find her, save her, bring her home.
- You should've told me.
- You would've tried to stop me.
Of course.
I don't want you to get hurt.
Sarah, I have to do this.
This is my mom, okay?
I need to know the truth.
No lying.
That was our rule.
In all fairness, I was just, you know, keeping a secret.
I wasn't lying.
New rule:
No secrets, no lies.
- Starting now.
- Starting now.
Great, you've made up.
How do we get out of here?
MARCO [OVER RADIO]:
You can't get out.
This is a living building, totally automated.
The security system is activated.
If you die, you die.
That sounds ominous.
Hope the file was worth it, Chuck.
We're sitting ducks in here.
Sorry, Mom.
- Chuck, what are you doing?
- I set off the EMP.
It disables the building.
We walk out of here.
But the computer, you'll lose the file.
You might never find your mom.
Yeah, well, it's not worth losing you.
Any of you.
Yeah, we get it.
Pull the trigger.
Okay, great.
Great plan.
Now what?
Now we deploy the best commie rifle ever invented, comrade AK-47.
Move it, move it.
Let's go, let's go.
- Everybody alive?
- I'm okay, I'm okay.
A little cold, but...
Anyone that matters?
Where's the getaway car?
Happy anniversary?
Happy anniversary.
[GASPS]
CHUCK:
So that's it.
That's the whole story.
Well, I'm just peeved you didn't ask us for help.
I'm sorry.
Will you help me find my mom?
Yes.
Yes, of course.
Chuck, you know what this means.
You're gonna have to rejoin the agency and be a spy.
I know.
The question is, do we tell Beckman about my mom?
No, not yet.
Chuck, what about your sister?
What are you gonna tell Ellie?
I have to tell her the truth.
I have to tell her that I am a spy.
[GASPS]
- Chuck.
- Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.
That's okay.
How are you?
- The interview didn't go well?
- No, none of them, really.
There's something that I have to do, Ellie.
It's okay, Chuck.
I know.
- What?
- I saw the new Buy More.
Uh, right, yeah.
I did get a job there.
- Ellie, I'm not...
That's not...
- It's okay, Chuck.
It's a job.
Those are really hard to come by these days, so...
My turn.
Sit down.
Okay.
What's up?
I'm pregnant.
What?
Are you...?
What?
Seriously?
I was gonna wait until Devon got home, but I saw you and I had to tell you.
- Oh, my God.
Ha, ha.
- Ha, ha.
Oh, my God, I'm so happy for you.
Oh, my God, I'm hugging you.
- Did I hurt the baby?
- Stop.
- Have I hurt the child?
- Chuck.
- Oh, my God, that's amazing.
- I'm really happy right now, Chuck.
I mean, I'm starting a family a new family, and you have Sarah, and you're safe, and just...
I'm really so happy right now.
CHUCK:
I couldn't tell her, not now.
She doesn't want me to be a spy but our dad gave me this mission to find our mom, to know the truth.
I can't not do this.
I have to do this.
That's not being a spy, that's being a brother.
I cracked into the deep database for your mom and this is all I could find.
Look at the top of the page.
- She was captured?
- Yeah.
And there's nothing else after that.
This whole time, Ellie and I thought that our mom left us because she didn't care about us.
But she was taken.
Are you gonna tell Ellie?
No.
No, not yet.
If my mom is still alive, I'm gonna find her and bring her home.
Why did you bring me here?
Found out some interesting information about you.
Someone's looking for you.
Who?
Your family.
Have you told Volkoff anything?
No, I told him nothing.
That's good.
That is very, very good.
[GRUNTING]
Wait.
Please, I have a family.
So do I.
[English

- SDH]
And the king was freed, and the castle was restored,
"and the Frost Queen returned home once more.
"This time, she was a hero.
"And the Frost Queen promised her children that she would never ever leave them again."
Good story?
I liked it.
The prince was cool.
Yes, he was.
Just like my little Chuck.
Mom?
Yeah?
Are you going away again?
Just for a few days, then right back to you and Ellie.
Good night, honey.
Love you.
Not nearly as much as I love you.
My mom was a spy.
After she disappeared, my father spent the rest of his life trying to find her.
Ellie and I thought she left us, that she just walked away, but what if we were wrong?
I need your help.
I need you to help me find my mom.
Holy cow!
I cannot belie this was beneath your house.
This is nuts!
A secret spy base.
I mean, it's got lasers and gadgets and... neatly organized files.
Hey, listen, why don't you just tell Casey and Sarah?
Because I know what they're gonna try and do.
They're gonna try and stop me.
They cannot.
I have to find the truth, Morgan-
Why my mom left, Why she never came back.
This is my search.
No.
It's our search.
I'm in.
Thanks.
Yeah.
Are you flexing?
What?
No, I was just kinda...
I'm excited.
Okay, good, good.
I can't even tell you how much
I appreciate your help on this.
But listen, one very, very, very important thing:
we cannot tell anyone, not a soul.
Not Sarah, not Casey, not Awesome, not Ellie.
Not Ellie.
I get it, I know.
You promised her you weren't gonna be a spy, you know?
So she clearly cannot know about our little rogue spy team that we're gonna start here outside of the government, secret to the spy world, team of two, army of one, highway to the danger zone,
live free or die hard...
Buddy.
Yeah?
This is not the opening of a TV show.
This is real life.
âª âª
Hey, Sarah, honey, is this the gun you were looking for?
Yes, thank you.
I got everything, dude.
You ready to go?
She's still here?
Hurry up.
Yeah?
You're the best.
Thank you so much.
Mmm.
A spy mission without me.
Couples do this all the time, right?
It's just a business trip.
Are you okay with this?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm fine.
I'm, you know.
I' got job interviews and Morgan and I are gonna spend quality time.
He signed us up for a go-cart racing league, so...
Come home soon.
Mmm.
Ugh!
I'm gonna be sick.
Come on, Walker, we got real work to do.
Like se the free world.
Enjoy your retirement, Bartowski.
What am I, what do I say?
What do we...?
I love you.
That's good.
I love you.
I like that.
I love you, too.
Be safe, okay?
Nothing is gonna keep me from coming back to yo
Better not.
Bye.
Mr. Carmichael, we're all set.
I have our tickets, cloned passports, money belts.
Let's do this.
Back in the game.
Me and you, real spies.
Sunblock.
We need sunblock.
âª âª
Excuse me.
Very sorry.
Pardon me.
I knew it.
I was right.
My mom's safe house.
This is where she got all of her missions when I was a kid.
You kn, speaking as the bookkeer for our int checki account, it mightave been a bit more affoable iwe started here and then traveled e world.
ah, we, we dn't really kw about re, now did we?
u got the code, buddy?
Yeah.
Yeah, code, code, code.
Here y go.
Thanks.
Oh, and if we t second, we need to he a lile bit of a bget conversation just because...
Hey, Morga not now
This is it.
My dad never made it this far.
Okay, Mom, where are you?
And it's notght?
Please tell me that it's not empty.
I don't get it.
I don't get it.
All the intel led right back here.
No.
No, no, no, there's got to be something.
There's got to be something.
There's got to be a... a- a secret compartment, you know?
Or a passageway or some clue that finally leads us to my mom.
Yeah.
Come on.
Come on!
Come on!
There's nothing.
Okay, so we didn't find your mom, but, uh, maybe we found a new dumpling house, huh?
All right, I don'know.
Let's pack it up, head home.
Fuel up on some dumplings and start again from scratch, okay?
Now we can do this, you and I...
All right.
We got close this time.
I know we're going to find her.
Oh, Chuck.
Talk to me, buddy, you know?
Let it out.
You want to cry?
Go for it.
I got two good shoulders.
What are we doing?
Why are we even bothering looking for my mom?
My dad ruined his life trying to find her.
She could have come back any time she wanted to, you know?
We're easy to find.
Her, not so much.
I'm done, man.
I
- I think I'm done.
Listen, you had to try, right?
Don't move, Chuck.
Get over here!
Morgan.
Morgan, Morgan.
Coming, coming.
Give me them keys.
Yeah, here you go, sir.
Here they are.
Here are your keys.
Just don't, please don't shoot me or Chuck.
Look, if this is has anything to do with my mom or-or Albania or Tangiers, or that-that cafe in Budapest which was...
Oh, that was not even...
Anyway, the point is we have explanations for all of that.
What are you talking about?
I'm here for the car.
I'm a repo man!
Repo man.
Morgan?
Right.
We haven't made a payment in four months.
The car cost $900.
Yeah, but we're $43,000 in debt.
I was gonna...
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa!
What?
What?
43 what?
$43,000 debt, and that's...
that's above the CIA money you had saved up because being a spy, apparently is really expensive.
Why didn't you...
why didn't you tell me?
Well, you were so busy looking for your mom...
Enough chitchat.
Get away from that car.
Just, uh, Chuck, give him a little, you know what I mean, Intersect style.
I don't do kung fu anymore, buddy.
You got some chop-socky, boy?
No, no chop-socky here, sir.
Fresh out of chop-socky.
Take the car.
That's what I thought.
My advice: get a job!
Working on it.
You know, Chuck, this does not happen to real spies.
I'm cornered.
What do I do?
MAN Use the device.
Make a move and you're dead, Marko.
Please, make a move.
I thought you said the EMP was a fake.
I was wrong.
Beautiful, isn't it?
Volkoff Industries' handheld EMP generator.
Will fry every electric circuit in a three-klick radius.
Volkoff's upping the ante.
The building's elevators are knocked out.
Mr. Volkoff's agents will be here in minutes.
You're trapped.
Put down your guns.
You know, he really should be here.
Chuck's the Intersect.
We could use him on a mission like this.
I hate cracking into computer systems.
Well, he made a promise to his sister.
Chuck doesn't want to be a spy and have to lie about it, too.
Your boyfriend needs some big boy pants.
He's a spy, he's good at it.
I know, Casey.
You miss him, too.
What?
I don't miss him.
Freeze now!
Oh, by the way, good idea to bring the chutes.
Thank you.
âª âª
Yes, Chuck.
Yes.
Nice.
I like this.
But l-less back.
Maybe just kind of a...
Hold that.
Hold that.
Right there, this whole sleepy confusion thing.
That's digital sex right there, my friend.
Morgan, what are you doing?
I'm putting the spark back in your relationship, dude.
Trust me.
Sarah's going to love these.
What?
Good.
Yeah.
Actually, if you don't mind,
I'll hit the peck deck a little bit.
Oh, and, uh... put baby oil, please.
Lube it up.
What?
Ba-ba...
What?
Lube it up.
Lube it.
No, no, no.
Grease it up.
Whatever you're doing, please stop.
Okay.
Okay.
I know you're down about your mom, Chuck.
Let's you and I have a little talk right now, man-to-man.
Okay.
Okay.
Man-to-man talk.
What are you doing in my room with baby oil?
More importantly, you and Sarah, okay?
'Cause every morning you're waking up missing her, acting like a sad sack.
I mean, I-I understand a little bit, you know, you're-you're stuck in this long-distance relationship right now that's short on intimacy.
That's okay.
It's all right.
But what you need to do is open your mind to what sex truly is.
It's sexting.
Yeah.
Short for sext writing.
It's intimacy for people in your situation.
Sexting.
Sex... sexting.
Sexting.
Sexting.
Sexting.
Buddy.
Now that the terrible ids are t of the way,
I told Ellie about the job hunt, and she's already lined up five interviews for today.
Okay.
I'll grab our bus passes.
But, uh, remember, um, sexting?
Oh, yeah, sex talk?
No, not going to happen.
Good luck on the job hunt.
Fine.
Do it myself.
I am so glad you could come in.
You know, with a rÃ©sumÃ© like this and a degree from Stanford, uh... it's astounding you haven't been snatched up already.
Snatch me up.
I'm 100% snatchable.
I'm sorry, I don't use the word "snatch" very often for a myriad of reasons.
Relax.hy are you so nervous?
Uh... you know, I'm not normally.
I
- I'm normally...
I'm normally a smooth operator.
Like Sade.
But today has been a strange, uh, day of interviews.
Really?
Well, how?
Well, for starters, um, have you ever had anyone fall asleep in an interview?
Um, just after that, the person sitting in your position got a little ill.
Just after that, the interviewer started going into convulsions...
The last interview I just came from, they-they told me they were going for a cup of coffee, and then they never came back.
I mean, how long does it take to get coffee?
That's really crazy.
Yeah.
Well, um...
I think, Chuck, that I have some good news for you.
Good.
Yeah.
How would you like to join...?
I thought I told them to hold my calls.
I
- I, uh...
I...
I don't think it's a good idea for you to answer that.
Hello.
Yes.
It's about you.
What?
Is... is everything okay?
What's happening?
Who is that?
Uh... unfortunately, Mr. Bartowski, the position's been filled.
What's happening?
Who was that?
And I'm going to have security escort you from the building.
Wait.
I'm s...
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Hang on a second.
What did I do?
Who was that on the phone?
Perhaps I could explain whatever the situation is.
Gentlemen, this is completely uncalled-for.
Look on the bright side, Chuck.
The bus has much more legroom than the hatchback.
There's a conspiracy against me.
I don't know.
I... always feel that way after a bad interview.
Except, with me, the conspiracy has been going on a lot longer.
You know?
Like, kindergarten.
Morgan, what am I supposed to do now?
These were Ellie's best leads.
Where am I going to find a job?
Well, there's...
always one place.
Where?
I can't believe it's back, Chuck.
âª âª
It's beautiful.
I can't believe how fast they rebuilt it.
Oh my...
Lord.
Welcome to the Buy More.
We're not open yet, but... but we are currently accepting rÃ©sumÃ©s.
Are you interested?
For what?
A job.
Maybe.
What-what, uh, types of positions are available?
I'm sure the store manager can help you with that.
Have at it.
Good luck.
So nervous.
Do you want me to show you around the store?
Yes, please.
That would be delightful.
Should I hold your hand?
No, you should not.
Okay.
Lead on.
Um...
Hello.
My name is Chuck Bartowski, and, uh... it's funny, uh...
I
- I used to work here.
You still do work here.
Hello, Chuck.
Welcome back.
Beckman had kittens when I told her about the EMP.
She wants us to find out where Volkoff's building it so we can blow the place up.
Another mission?
We've been at it for months, and I haven't seen Chuck in...
forever.
There's something else.
Beckman wants Chuck to come down here, take a look at the EMP, see if he flashes.
Chuck is a civilian now.
We can't force him to be a spy, can we?
You might want to tell Beckman that yourself.
Oh, Chuck.
As you can see, we spared no expense recreating the Buy More.
Um, yeah, uh, General,
I
- I appreciate the tour and all...
It's no longer simply a retail store.
It's now a full-fledged CIA-NSA substation.
We can patch into security cameras all over the world.
Satellite relays-
NORAD, NASA, Strategic Air Command.
Hit that red button, we go to DEFCON 1.
Is that, uh...
is that really the safest place to put that- out in the open?
There's a new laser-based security system.
General, this is crazy.
You realize this is crazy.
No, it's not.
After the success of Operation Bartowski, the president made you a priority.
I beg your pardon.
The-the-the president president?
Like, the actual...
You're being totally serious.
General, I am out of the spy game.
You're out when I say you're out.
If memory serves, you actually said,
"Chuck, you are out of the spy game."
I changed my mind.
You're back.
Discussion over.
And don't think you're going to find another job.
Why...?
You... you... you.
That was you on the phone, wasn't it?
You tanked my interviews, didn't you?
Oh.
Hi, Sarah.
Back in town?
Chuck, listen to me.
You do not have to be a spy.
Oh, no, no.
I know.
Yeah.
Beckman just offered me a position, and I turned her down.
How did she react?
Well, she...
Chuck, hello?
Hey.
Hey.
That went well, I think.
I'm...
I'm sorry.
I should have called, but we just got in.
No, hey, it's fine- 'cause you're here, and I'm here, and... and I miss you a lot.
Mmm.
Mmm.
Mmm.
I missed you, too.
This is the mission that just won't end.
I get it.
It's important work, okay?
But you're here now at least for a little while, right?
Few weeks?
Days?
Hours?
Enough sap.
Hey, Sarah, what...
Let's take a look at the mission at hand.
What are you...?
Flash.
Gah!
Hah!
Well?
Thanks, Casey.
EMP- uh, manufactured in Venezuela at the Corta Verona facility, which is a subsidiary of Volkoff Industries.
Who's Volkoff?
Don't tell me.
Alexei Volkoff- arms dealer, recluse.
He's like the Russian Howard Hughes.
We've been chasing after him for months, and with that single flash, we might just be able to take him down.
Good to have you back.
Oh, I'm not staying.
I think he misses you.
Oh, I know he does.
This is nuts, man.
The Buy More is being run by the CIA.
Amazing.
Which would make you a spy, huh?
You are very perceptive, Mr. Grimes.
Guilty.
I got to say, the new Castle is pretty freaking sweet.
And it's nice to be back down in here with u.
Chuck, can we talk?
Of course.
Anytime.
About what?
Well, I know this is awkward, but, um...
I just have to ask about the picture.
What, uh... what picture?
Hi-oh.
Chuck, do you want to sext with me?
Ah!
No!
I don't...
I mean...
I...
No.
No, no.
No, uh, this... this isn't my idea.
Cleary not my idea.
This was Morgan's doing.
Well, don't worry.
I...
I thought it was cute.
Here's the thing- I don't know if you know this, but, uh, I actually was an agent myself for a little while last year.
What if we got together, maybe... show each other a few moves?
You know, I...
I have a trip to Thailand in the morning.
Mmm.
Sure.
Sure.
It's a new mission.
Oh, of course.
It's the life of a...
I could show you something right now.
Really?
Yeah.
You know.
So, six/nine-month anniversary.
What do you think?
Well, I-I have to go away again, but when I come back, we will celebrate in style.
Fantastic.
No phones necessary.
No.
Unless you want.
No.
I don't know what that means.
Uh, forget I even said anything.
Hey, hey, hey.
What-what... what is.. what is...
what is this?
The emblem?
That's Volkoff's.
He is not afraid to advertise.
Well, I have to go debrief with Beckman and Casey, but we'll talk later?
Yeah, great.
Whoa.
New Buy More rules.
Slides and trap doors and the new superspy/Nerd Herder, Greta.
Be still, my beating heart.
She digs me.
I can tell.
Morgan.
Uh-huh?
We need to get the car back.
Uh, with the creepy guy?
Okay, I'm sorry.
Again, tell me why we're here.
I mean, this menu's linked to an arms dealer?
Look, I thought the last mission was a bust, okay?
But the menu could be the link that brings us to my mom.
Maybe she was after Volkoff just like Casey and Sarah.
Okay, listen, I get the menu- we get out of here quietly.
Yes, yes, quick and quiet.
There it is.
You young, oversexed, underworked kids.
You don't mess with a repo man.
Not ever!
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir, Mr. repo man, sir.
We are not here to mess with you.
We just...
Morgan, get the... get the... get the menu!
Oh, repo man, Excuse me for one second.
I'm just going to just, very slowly...
I'm just going to kind of...
He's just reaching...
Here we go.
Here we go.
Perfect.
Please, this is all we want and then we're leaving.
We're out of your hair.
You want a menu, for what?
Chinese.
Dumplings.
Oh, yeah?
A good place?
No.
It's...
No.
No.
I like good Chinese.
Hard to find.
Hand it over.
Buddy, you remember how we got out of that jam in Tangiers?
Tangiers?
Think it'll work?
Tangiers?
What does that mean?
It means that we need to run!
Run!
RunRun!
Run!
Damn you!
I love dumplings.
It's really weird.
Most of these are just your run-of-the-mill dishes, but a few of these I haven't even heard of before.
Which ones?
Which dishes?
For example, this.
Shimira Chicken.
Ah, Shimira.
Okay, Shimira is actually a nav system for spy subs.
This is not a menu for ordering food.
This is a menu for ordering weapons.
Why would your mom have that?
Let's call and find out.
Use your dad's encrypted phone.
Okay.
Let's see here.
Who is this?
Identify.
This is Carmichael.
I work for the Ring.
The Ring was eliminated.
We are an offshoot of the Ring.
The New Ring.
I'm the head of security.
I'll need to see your organization firsthand if we agree to work.
Then you'll have to come to Volkoff Industries in Moscow.
Moscow, Russia.
Not a problem.
The New Ring has very deep pockets.
We're going to Russia.
Okay.
I'm going to have to sell my Millennium Falcon.
And God bless you.
Yes, I'm here.
Just tell me when and where.
We have a jet on standby.
Okay, so we I.D. Volkoff's facility and then we can take it out with a single drone strike.
Have you ever been in a long-distance relationship?
No.
I either leave or they die.
I'm going to the head.
âª âª
WOMAN Please fasten your seat belts.
We're heading into a bit of turbulence.
Release the gas.
I'll reroute the flight to Moscow.
Where are we?
Desolation, frostbite.
Must be Russia.
Welcome to Volkoff Industries.
I'm glad you could finally make it.
Take a load off.
Relax.
And think about all the terrible things
I will do to you.
We're pros, Marko.
Your methods won't work on us.
Remember, I work for Volkoff.
I must break you.
Remember the plan.
We have to access the Volkoff computer system to see what they have on my mom.
Does that make sense?
Completely.
Although I think my face is still frozen.
Hello.
We're with the Ring.
The New Ring.
This is Charles Carmichael.
I'm Michael Carmichael.
So, if you wouldn't mind...
Frigid in here, as well.
Wow.
The plan was for me to be Carmichael and you to be Sven, my mute assistant.
See, here's the thing.
These people respect a beard.
And that whole assistant thing...
I don't know.
I see us more as brothers.
Is that so?
Okay, okay, fine.
What parents in their right mind would name their child Michael if their last name was Carmichael?
That's crazy.
What were your parents thinking?
What were our parents thinking?
You know.
It's what people in the movie business call improv.
Nice photo.
Good work, Walker.
Get the phone.
Okay.
I know where the server is.
It's actually not far from where we are.
If my father's codes still work, we should be able to get in.
What do you think?
Uh, maybe you drop a little Intersect style on these fools.
Karate chop your way in.
I will hide behind the receptionist desk.
You know, that, or we could just run really fast.
Tangiers?
Here?
Tangiers.
Exactly.
Ah, could work.
The case.
One, two, three.
We go.
Come on, come on, come on, come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
I almost got it.
Oh.
I've never run so fast in so many layers before.
Game time.
Yup.
This place is nuts.
Yeah, it's a Cold War relic, buddy.
Oh, dude, what is this?
Morgan, that's an EMP, so I wouldn't touch that.
This is an EMP?
Yes, it is.
No touching, Morgan.
Got ya.
Got ya.
Good work, Walker.
Call Beckman.
No, I can't call.
It's gonna be too loud.
I'll text Chuck.
I was texting before.
Your phone.
Yeah, I'm kind of busy right now.
Oh.
Sarah.
She's sexting you.
Not now, Morgan.
Got ya.
Go on... my lady.
What does he say?
He thinks we're sexting.
What?
What does that even mean?
SOS.
SOS.
Skin on skin.
Yes, please.
Oh, come on.
Filthy.
He still thinks we're sexting.
You kiss your mom with those thumbs?
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God.
Daddy likes.
Oh, you're in trouble.
Daddy likes.
Hey, someone's coming.
We're inside Volkoff.
Subbasement four.
Tell him!
Okay.
Got it.
Bypassed their security.
I'm in.
Awesome.
Awesome.
Anything?
Well, there's nothing coming up with her name, but I'm checking aliases, missions my dad thought she went on or weapons she was after.
Hang on.
Hang on.
Wait a minute.
Frost.
Frost.
The Frost Queen.
My mom used to tell me a stories when I was a kid about the Frost Queen.
That can't be it.
Well, either way, let's download it and get out of here.
It's encrypted.
It's encrypted.
But I have a program that can hack it, and then we can download it.
Right.
Uh, quickly.
Wait a minute.
Oh, crap.
What?
It's Sarah, but it's...
I
- I thought she was sexting, dude.
She's here with Casey, and they're in trouble.
Dude, what do we do?
Call Beckman.
I'll call Beckman, or CIA, or the Marines, because someone's got to save 'em.
Who's gonna save 'em?
We are.
Enough with the toes.
No one's coming.
I would love nothing more than to put bullets in both your heads.
Yeah, go ahead and do it.
Don't jabber.
Just do it.
The problem is you're not the two agents I'm looking for.
In the past six months, two CIA agents have gotten closer to Volkoff Industries than any other spy.
They're ghosts.
They expertly use public transportation to avoid being tracked.
So tell me who are these master spies?
No idea.
Never seen 'em.
Morgan, this way.
Back, back, back, back, back, back, back.
MAN We've got them - they're in the building.
They're here.
They must have come for you.
Well, that's their first mistake.
This entire building...
is a trap.
So, buddy, how rusty is your kung fu?
I haven't used it in months.
Great.
So... do you want to speak to your friend?
Chuck, what's going on?
What are you doing here?
Sarah, I know you must have a lot of questions for me right now, and I promise I will explain everything later.
Listen, you've got to flash, okay?
You've got to get out of here.
I've heard enough.
No, please, this is a big mistake.
He's not a spy.
Kill them.
No, please, no.
Well, it all seemed a bit anticlimactic.
I'm gonna tear you limb from limb from limb.
Okay, I got it.
Somebody please shoot this guy?
CHUCK Hello?
Uh... yes, who is it?
Look, you clearly have no idea who I am since you only sent ten of your men to take care of me, so let me break it down for you:
if you touch one hair on Sarah's head,
I will do to you what I've just done to your men.
Do you understand?
I'm coming down there right now.
Scary enough?
I'm scared.
I was scared when you...
You are not rusty at all, Chuck.
You are limber.
I suggest you start running... right about now.
Follow me.
Aah... that hurts.
I'm so out of spy shape.
What the hell are you doing here?
Saving your lives, okay?
Let's just call it that for now.
I'm good.
Cut me free.
I got some Russians to kill.
Not yet- there's one more thing I have to do.
I'm waiting for you, and I don't like to wait.
MAN Boss, the Americans have escaped.
Chuck, why are we here?
What, the computer?
This is what you came here for?
Look, Sarah, I have to tell you the truth.
I took over my father's search for my mom.
She's a spy, she is a spy, I-I don't know.
I thought I could find her, I could save her, I could bring her home.
You should have told me.
You would have tried to stop me.
Of course I would have.
I don't want you to get hurt.
Sarah, I have to do this.
This is my mom, okay, I need to know the truth.
No lying- that was our rule.
In all fairness, I was just, you know, keeping a secret.
I wasn't lying.
New rule:
no secrets, no lies.
Starting now.
Great, you've made up.
Now, how do we get out of here?
MARKO You can't get out.
This is a living building, totally automated.
The security system is activated.
If you die, you die.
That sounds ominous.
Hope the file was worth it, Chuck.
We're sitting ducks in here.
Sorry, Mom.
Chuck, what are you doing?
If I set off the EMP, it disables the building and we walk out of here.
But, Chuck, the computer.
You'll lose the file.
You might never find your mom.
Yeah, well, it's not worth losing you.
Any of you.
Yeah, we get it.
Pull the trigger.
Okay, great, great plan.
Now what?
Now we employ the best commie rifle ever invented
- Comrade AK-47.
âª âª
Move it.
Move it.
Everybody alive?
I'm okay, I'm okay, a little cold, but...
Anyone that matters?
Where's the getaway car?
Happy anniversary?
Happy anniversary.
So that's it.
That's the whole story.
Well, I'm just peeved you didn't ask us for help.
I'm sorry.
Will you help me find my mom?
Yes.
Yes, of course.
But, Chuck, you know what this means.
You're going to have to rejoin the Agency and be a spy.
I know.
The question is:
do we tell Beckman about my mom?
Mm-mm.
No, not yet.
Chuck, what about your sister?
What are you going to tell Ellie?
I have to tell her the truth.
I have to tell her that I am a spy.
âª âª
Chuck.
Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.
Oh, that's okay.
How are you?
The interview didn't go well?
No, none of 'em, really, but there's something that I have to do, Ellie.
It's okay, Chuck.
I know.
What?
I saw the new Buy More.
Uh, right, yeah, I did get a job there.
Ellie, I'm not- that's not what I...
It's okay, Chuck.
It's a job.
Those are really hard to come by these days, so...
My turn.
Let's sit down.
Okay.
What's up?
I'm pregnant.
What?
Are you- what, seriously?
!
I
- I was going to wait until Devon got home, but I, I saw you and I had to tell you.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, I'm so- oh, my God, I'm hugging you.
Uh, I- am I- did I hurt the baby?
I hurt the child.
Chuck.
Oh, my God, that's amazing.
I'm really happy right now, Chuck.
I mean, I'm starting a family- a new family- and you have Sarah and you're safe and... just I'm really so happy right now.
I couldn't tell her, not now.
She doesn't want me to be a spy, but my dad gave me this mission to find our mom, to know the truth.
I can't not do this.
I have to do this.
That's not being a spy, that's being a brother.
I cracked into the deep database for your mom and this is all I could find.
Look at the top of the page.
She was captured?
Yeah, and there's nothing else after that.
This whole time, Ellie and I thought that our mom left us because she didn't care about us, but she was taken.
Are you going to tell Ellie?
No.
No, not yet.
If my mom is still alive,
I'm going to find her and bring her home.
Why did you bring me here?
I found out some interesting information about you.
Someone is looking for you.
Who?
Your family.
Have you told Volkoff anything?
No, I told him nothing.
That's good.
That is very, very good.
Please.
I have a family.
So do I.
"And the king was freed, and the castle was restored and the Frost Queen returned home once more.
This time, she was a hero.
And the Frost Queen promised her children that she would never, ever leave them again."
- Good story?
- I liked it.
The prince was cool.
Yes, he was, just like my little Chuck.
- Mom.
- Yeah?
Are you going away again?
Just for a few days, then right back to you and Ellie.
Good night, honey.
Love you.
Not nearly as much as I love you.
My mom was a spy.
After she disappeared, my father spent the rest of his life trying to find her.
Ellie and I thought she left us, that she just walked away.
But what if we were wrong?
I need your help.
I need you to help me find my mom.
Holy cow.
I cannot believe this was beneath your house.
This is nuts.
A secret spy base, and it's got lasers and gadgets and neatly organized files.
Why don't you just tell Casey and Sarah?
I know they're gonna try and stop me.
They cannot.
Why my mom left, why she never came back.
- This is my search.
- No, it's our search.
I'm in.
- Thanks, man.
- Yeah.
- Are you flexing?
- What?
No.
- I'm just kind of excited.
- Okay, good, good.
I can't even tell you how much I appreciate your help.
We cannot tell anyone, not a soul.
Not Sarah, not Casey, not Awesome, not Ellie.
Not Ellie.
I know.
You promised her you weren't gonna be a spy.
So she clearly cannot know about our little rogue spy team here.
Outside of the government, secret to the spy world.
Team of two, army of one, highway to the danger zone, live free or die...
- Buddy.
- Yeah?
This is not the opening of a TV show.
This is real life.
- Is this the gun you were looking for?
- Yes.
Got everything, dude.
You ready to go?
She's still here?
Hurry up.
Yeah?
You're the best.
Thank you so much.
Mm.
- Spy mission without me.
- Couples do this all the time, right?
It's just a business trip.
- You okay with this?
- Yeah.
Yeah, I'm fine.
Um, I got job interviews, and Morgan and I will spend quality time.
He signed us up for a go-kart racing league, so...
Come home soon.
Mm.
Ugh, I'm gonna be sick.
Walker, we got real work to do, like save the free world.
Enjoy retirement, Bartowski.
- What am I, uh...?
What do I say?
- "I love you."
That's good, "I love you." I like that.
I love you too.
Be safe, okay?
Nothing is gonna keep me from coming back to you.
Better not.
Bye.
Mr. Carmichael, we're all set.
I have our tickets, cloned passports, money belts.
Let's do this.
Back in the game.
Me and you, real spies.
Sunblock.
We need sunblock.
Excuse me.
Very sorry.
- Pardon me.
- Aah!
Agh.
I knew it.
I was right.
My mom's safe house.
This is where she got all her missions when I was a kid.
Speaking as the bookkeeper for our joint account it might've been more affordable if we started here and then traveled the world.
Yeah, well, we didn't really know about here, now, did we?
- You got the code, buddy?
- Yeah.
Yeah, code, code, code.
- Here you go.
- Thanks.
Oh, uh, if we get a second, we need to have a budget conversation...
Hey, Morgan, not now.
This is it.
My dad never made it this far.
Okay, Mom, where are you?
And it's not empty, right?
Please tell me that it's not empty.
I don't get it.
I don't get it.
All the intel led right back here.
No, no, no.
There's gotta be something.
There's gotta be a...
A...
A secret compartment, you know?
Or a passageway, or some clue that finally leads us to my mom.
- Yeah.
- Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
There's nothing.
Okay, so we didn't find your mom but, uh, maybe we found a new dumpling house, huh?
All right, well, I don't know.
Let's pack it up, uh, head home fuel up on some dumplings, and we start again from scratch, okay?
Now, we can do this, you and I...
All right.
- We got close this time.
- I know we're gonna find her.
Oh, Chuck.
Talk to me, buddy, you know?
Let it out.
You wanna cry, go for it.
I got two good shoulders.
What are we doing?
Why are we even bothering looking for my mom?
My dad ruined his life trying to find her.
She could've come back anytime she wanted to.
We're easy to find.
Her, not so much.
I'm done, man.
I think I'm done.
Uh, listen, we have to try, right?
- Don't move, Chuck.
- Get over here.
- Morgan, Morgan, Morgan.
- Coming, coming.
Give me them keys.
Yeah, here you go, sir.
Here they are.
Here are your keys.
Just please don't shoot me or Chuck.
Look, if this has anything to do with my mom or Albania or Tangiers or that café in Budapest...
- That was not his fault.
- Anyway, we have explanations for them.
What are you talking about?
I'm here for the car.
I'm a repo man.
Repo man.
Morgan?
Right.
We haven't made a payment in four months.
- The car cost $900.
- Yeah, but we're $43,000 in debt.
- I was gonna...
- Wait.
What?
What?
43 what?
Thousand dollars' debt, and that's above the CIA money you had saved up.
Being a spy is really expensive.
- Why didn't you tell me?
- You were so busy looking for your mom...
All right, enough chitchat.
Get away from that car.
Uh, Chuck, give him a little...
You know what I mean?
Intersect style.
I don't do kung fu anymore.
You got some chop-socky, boy?
No.
No chop-socky here, sir.
Fresh out of chop-socky.
- Take the car.
- That's what I thought.
My advice, get a job.
Working on it.
You know, Chuck, this does not happen to real spies.
I'm cornered.
What do I do?
Use the device.
Make a move and you're dead, Marco.
Please, make a move.
I thought you said the EMP was a fake.
- I was wrong.
- Beautiful, isn't it?
Volkoff Industries' handheld EMP generator.
Will fry every electric circuit in a three-klick radius.
Volkoff's upping the ante.
The building elevators are knocked out.
Mr. Volkoff's agents will be here in minutes.
You're trapped.
Put down your guns.
He really should be here.
Chuck's the Intersect.
Could use him on a mission like this.
I hate cracking into computer systems.
Well, he made a promise to his sister.
Chuck doesn't wanna be a spy and have to lie about it.
Your boyfriend needs some big-boy pants.
He's a spy, he's good at it.
I know, Casey, you miss him too.
What?
I don't miss him.
Don't move.
Stay where you are.
Oh, by the way, good idea to bring the chutes.
Thank you.
Yes, nice.
I like this.
But less back.
Maybe just kind of, uh...
Hold that.
Right there, this whole sleepy confusion thing.
- That's digital sex right there.
- What are you doing?
Putting the spark back in your relationship.
Sarah's gonna love these.
Good.
Yeah.
Actually, if you don't mind, hit the peck deck a little bit.
Oh, and, uh, a little baby oil, please.
- Lube it up.
- What?
Ba...?
Ba...?
- What?
No, no, no.
- Lube it up.
- Whatever you're doing, please stop.
- Okay.
Okay.
I know you're down about your mom, Chuck.
Let's you and I have a little talk right now, man to man.
Okay.
Okay.
Man-to-man talk.
What are you doing in my room with baby oil?
More importantly, you and Sarah.
Every morning, you wake up missing her, acting like a sad sack.
I understand.
You're stuck in this long-distance relationship that's short on intimacy.
That's okay.
It's all right.
But what you need to do is open your mind to what sex truly is.
It's sexting.
Yeah, short for "sext writing."
It's intimacy for people in your situation.
Sexting.
- Sexting.
- Sexting.
- Sexting.
- Sexting.
Buddy.
The terrible ideas are out of the way.
I told Ellie about the job hunt.
She's lined up five interviews for today.
Okay.
I'll grab our bus passes.
But, uh, remember, um, sexting.
Oh, yeah, sex talk.
No, not gonna happen.
Good luck on the job hunt.
Fine, I'll do it myself.
I am so glad you could come in.
You know, with a résumé like this and a degree from Stanford, it's astounding you haven't been snatched up.
Snatch me up.
I'm 100 percent snatchable.
I don't use the word "snatch" often, for a myriad of reasons.
Relax.
Why are you so nervous?
Ah...
You know, I'm not normally.
I'm normally a smooth operator.
Like Sade.
But today has been a strange, uh, day of interviews.
Really?
Well, how?
Well, for starters, um, have you ever had anyone fall asleep in an interview?
Um, just after that, the person sitting in your position got a little ill.
Just after that, the interviewer started going into convulsions.
The last interview I just came from they told me they were going for a cup of coffee, and then they never came back.
I mean, how long does it take to get coffee?
- That's really crazy.
- Yeah.
Well, um, I think, Chuck, that I have some good news for you.
- Good.
- Yeah.
How would you like to join...?
Oh.
I thought I told them to hold my calls.
I...
I...
Uh, I don't think it's a good idea to answer...
Hello?
Yes.
It's about you.
What?
Is everything okay?
What's happening?
Who is that?
Uh...
Unfortunately, Mr. Bartowski, the position has been filled.
What's happening?
Who was that?
And I'm going to have Security escort you from the building.
Wait.
I'm...
Wait, wait, wait.
Hang on a second.
What did I do?
Who was that?
Perhaps I could explain whatever the situation is.
This is completely uncalled for.
Look on the bright side, Chuck.
Bus has much more legroom than the hatchback.
- There's a conspiracy against me.
- I feel that way after a bad interview.
Except with me, the conspiracy has been going on a lot longer.
Like kindergarten.
What am I supposed to do now?
These were Ellie's best leads.
Where am I gonna find a job?
Well, there's always one place.
Where?
I can't believe it's back, Chuck.
It's beautiful.
I can't believe how fast they rebuilt it.
Oh, my...
- Lord.
- Welcome to the Buy More.
We're not open yet.
But we are currently accepting résumés.
- Are you interested?
- For what?
- A job.
- Maybe.
What, uh, types of positions are available?
I'm sure the store manager can help you with that.
- Have at it.
- Good luck.
So nervous.
Do you want me to show you around?
Yes, that would be delightful.
Should I hold your hand?
- No, you should not.
- Okay, lead on.
Um...
Hello.
My name is Chuck Bartowski, and, uh, it's funny, I used to work here.
You still do work here.
Hello, Chuck.
Welcome back.
Huh.
Beckman had kittens when I told her about the EMP.
She wants us to find Volkoff's building so we can blow the place up.
Another mission?
We've been at it for months.
And I haven't seen Chuck in forever.
There's something else.
Beckman wants Chuck to come here, take a look at the EMP, see if he flashes.
Well, Chuck is a civilian now.
We can't force him to be a spy, can we?
You might wanna tell Beckman that yourself.
Oh, Chuck.
As you can see, we spared no expense re-creating the Buy More.
Um, yeah, uh, general, I appreciate the tour and all...
It's no longer simply a retail store.
It's now a full-fledged CIA-NSA substation.
We can patch into security cameras all over the world.
Satellite relay, NORAD, NASA, the Joint Chiefs.
Hit that red button, we go to DEFCON 1.
Is that, uh, really the safest place to put that, out in the open?
- There's a laser-based security system.
- This is crazy.
- You realize this is crazy.
- No, it's not.
After the success of Operation Bartowski the president made you a priority.
I beg your pardon?
The "president" president?
Like the actual?
You...
You're...
You're being totally ser...
- I am out of the spy game.
- You're out when I say you're out.
If memory serves, you actually said, "Chuck, you are out of the spy game."
I changed my mind.
You're back, discussion over.
And don't think you're going to find another job.
Why?
You, you, you.
That was you on the phone, wasn't it?
You tanked my interviews, didn't you?
Oh.
Hi, Sarah.
Back in town?
- Listen, you do not have to be a spy.
- Oh, no, no.
I know, yeah.
Beckman just offered me a position and I turned her down.
- How did she react?
- Well, she...
Whoa!
- Chuck, hello?
- Aah!
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
- That went well, I think.
- I'm sorry.
- I should have called, but we just got in.
- No, it's fine.
Because you're here and I'm here.
- And I miss you a lot.
- Mm.
I miss you too.
- This is the mission that just won't end.
- It's important work.
But you're here now.
At least for a little while, right?
- Few weeks?
Days?
Hours?
- Okay, enough sap.
- Hey.
Sarah, what...?
- Take a look at the mission at hand.
Flash.
Ah.
Ah.
Well?
Thanks, Casey.
EMP, uh, manufactured in Venezuela, the Corta Verona facility which is a subsidiary of Volkoff Industries.
Who's Volkoff?
Don't tell me.
Alexei Volkoff.
Arms dealer, recluse.
He's like the Russian Howard Hughes.
We've been chasing after him for months.
And with that single flash, we might just be able to take him down.
- Good to have you back.
- Oh, I'm not staying.
- I think he misses you.
Misses the flash.
- Oh, I know.
This is nuts, man.
The Buy More is being run by the CIA.
Amazing.
Which would make you a spy, huh?
- You are very perceptive, Mr. Grimes.
- Yeah, guilty.
I gotta say, the new Castle is pretty freaking sweet.
And it's nice to be back down in here with you.
- Can we talk?
- Of course, anytime.
About what?
Well, I know this is awkward, but, um, I just have to ask about the picture.
What, uh...?
What picture?
- Hi-oh.
- Chuck, do you wanna sext with me?
Ah.
No, I don't...
I mean...
No.
No, no.
Uh, this...
This isn't my idea.
It's clearly not my idea.
This was Morgan's doing.
Don't worry.
I thought it was cute.
Here's the thing.
I don't know if you know this.
Uh, I was an agent a little while last year.
What if we got together, maybe showed each other a few moves?
You know, I have a trip to Thailand in the morning.
- Mm.
Sure, sure.
- It's a new mission.
- Oh, of course, it's the life of a...
- I could show you something right now.
- Really?
Yeah.
- You know?
Ahem.
So six/nine-month anniversary.
What do you think?
Well, I have to go away again.
But when I come back, we will celebrate in style.
Fantastic.
No phones necessary.
- Unless you want.
- No.
I don't even know what that means.
Forget I ever said that.
Hey, hey, hey, what is this?
The emblem?
That's Volkoff's.
He is not afraid to advertise.
I have to go debrief with Beckman and Casey.
- But we'll talk later?
- Yeah, great.
- Mm.
- Mm.
Whoa.
Whoa.
New Buy More rules.
Slides and trapdoors and the new super spy/Nerd Herder Greta.
Be still, my beating heart.
She digs me, I can tell.
- Morgan.
- Mm-hm.
We need to get the car back.
With the creepy guy?
Okay.
I'm sorry.
Again, tell me why we're here.
This menu is linked to an arms dealer?
Look, I thought the last mission was a bust, okay?
But the menu could be the link that brings us to my mom.
Maybe she was after Volkoff like Sarah.
Okay, I'll get the menu, we get out of here quietly.
Yes, yes, quick and quiet.
There it is.
Aah!
Whoa.
Uh...
You young, oversexed, underworked kids.
You don't mess with a repo man.
Not ever.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir, Mr. Repo-Man, sir.
We are not here to mess with you.
Morgan, get the...
- Get the menu.
Get the...
- Whoa, repo man.
- Excuse me just for one second.
- I'm gonna just very slowly...
- There we go.
- Perfect.
- This is all we want, then we're leaving.
- You want a menu?
For what?
- Chinese.
- Dumplings.
Yeah?
Good place?
- No.
No.
It's...
- No.
I wouldn't say...
I like good Chinese.
Hard to find, though.
Hand it over.
You remember how we got out of that jam in Tangiers?
- Think it'll work?
- "Tangiers." What does that mean?
It means that we need to run!
Run, run, run!
Damn you!
I love dumplings.
It's really weird.
Most of these are just your run-of-the-mill dishes.
But a few of these I haven't even heard of before.
Which ones?
Which dishes?
For example, this Shimira Chicken.
Ah.
Shimira.
Okay, Shimira is actually a nav system for spy subs.
This is not a menu for ordering food.
This is a menu for ordering weapons.
Wh...?
Why would your mom have that?
- Let's call and find out.
- Use your dad's encrypted phone.
- Ahem.
- Ahem.
Whew.
Who is this?
Identify.
This is Carmichael.
I work for The Ring.
The Ring was eliminated.
We are an offshoot of The Ring.
The New Ring.
I'm the head of security.
I'll need to see your organization firsthand if we agree to work.
Then you have to come to Volkoff Industries in Moscow.
Moscow, Russia.
Not a problem.
The New Ring has very deep pockets.
- We're going to Russia.
- Okay.
I'm gonna have to sell my Millennium Falcon.
Then God bless you.
- Are you still there?
- Yes, I'm here.
Just tell me when and where.
We have a jet on standby.
Okay, so we ID Volkoff's facility and we can take it out with a single drone strike.
Have you ever been in a long-distance relationship?
No.
Ahem.
I either leave or they die.
I'm going to the head.
Please fasten your seatbelts.
We're heading into a bit of turbulence.
Release the gas and I'll reroute the flight to Moscow.
Where are we?
Well, desolation, frostbite.
Must be Russia.
Welcome to Volkoff Industries.
Glad you could finally make it.
Take a load off, relax and think about all the terrible things that we'll do to you.
We're pros, Marco.
Your methods won't work on us.
Remember, I work for Volkoff.
I must break you.
Remember the plan.
Access the Volkoff computer system and see what they have on my mom.
- Does that make sense?
- Completely.
- Although, I think my face is still frozen.
- Okay.
Hello.
We're with The Ring.
The New Ring.
This is Charles Carmichael.
I'm Michael Carmichael.
So if you wouldn't mind...
Frigid in here as well.
Wow.
The plan was for me to be Carmichael and you to be Sven, my mute assistant.
Here's the thing.
These people respect a beard.
And the whole assistant thing, I see us more as brothers.
Is that so?
Okay, okay, fine.
What parents in their right mind would name their child Michael if their last name was Carmichael?
- What were your parents thinking?
- What were our parents thinking?
You know, it's what people in the movie business call improv.
Nice photo.
Good work, Walker.
Get the phone.
I know where the server is.
It's not far.
If my father's codes still work, we should get in.
What do you think?
Um, maybe drop a little Intersect style on these fools.
Karate chop your way in.
I will hide behind the receptionist desk.
Yeah, that, or we could just run really fast.
Tangiers?
Here?
- Tangiers, exactly.
- Ah, could work.
Pick up the case.
One, two, three.
Here we go.
Hurry up.
Come on.
- Come on.
- Almost got it.
Oh.
I've never run so fast in so many layers before.
- Game time.
- Yep.
- This place is nuts.
- Yeah, it's a Cold War relic, buddy.
Oh, dude.
What is this?
Morgan, that's an EMP.
So I wouldn't touch that.
- This is an EMP?
- Yes, it is.
No touching, Morgan.
Gotcha, gotcha.
Good work, Walker.
Call Beckman.
No, I can't call.
It's gonna be too loud.
I'll text Chuck.
I was texting before.
- Your phone.
- Yeah, I'm kind of busy right now.
I'll get it for you.
Sarah.
She's sexting you.
- Not now, Morgan.
- Gotcha.
Go on, milady.
- What does he say?
- He thinks we're sexting.
What?
What does that even mean?
"SOS." SOS.
Skin on skin.
Yes, please.
Oh, come on.
Filthy.
- He still thinks we're sexting.
- You kiss your mom with those thumbs?
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Daddy likes.
Oh, you're in trouble.
Daddy likes.
Hey, someone's coming.
We're inside Volkoff, Subbasement 4.
Tell him.
Got it.
Bypassed their security.
I'm in.
Awesome, awesome.
- Anything?
- Nothing coming up with her name.
I'm checking aliases, missions Dad thought she went on, weapons she was after.
Hang on.
Hang on.
Wait a minute. "Frost."
Frost.
The Frost Queen.
My mom used to tell me stories about the Frost Queen.
- That can't be it.
- Either way, let's download and get out.
It's encrypted.
It's encrypted.
But I have a program that can hack it.
- And then we can download it.
- Right.
Quickly.
Wait a minute.
Oh, crap.
- What?
- It's Sarah.
But it's...
I thought she was sexting, dude.
She's here with Casey, and they're in trouble.
What do we do?
Call Beckman.
Beckman or CIA or the Marines, because someone's gotta save them.
Who's gonna save them?
We are.
Enough with the toes.
No one's coming.
I would love nothing more than to put bullets in both your heads.
Yeah, go ahead and do it.
Don't jabber, just do it.
The problem is you're not the two agents I'm looking for.
In the past six months, two CIA agents have gotten closer to Volkoff Industries than any other spy.
They're ghosts.
They expertly use public transportation to avoid being tracked.
So tell me who are these master spies?
- No idea.
- Never seen them.
Morgan, this way.
Back, back, back.
Got them.
They're in the building.
They're here.
They must have come for you.
Well, that's their first mistake.
This entire building is a trap.
So, buddy, how rusty is your kung fu?
I haven't used it in months.
Great.
So you want to speak to your friend?
Chuck, what's going on?
What are you doing here?
I know you must have a lot of questions, and I promise I will explain later.
You've gotta flash.
You've gotta get out.
- I've heard enough.
- This is a mistake.
He's not a spy.
- Kill them.
- No, please, no.
Chuck?
Well, it all seemed a bit anticlimactic.
I'm gonna tear you limb from limb from limb.
Okay, I got it.
Somebody please shoot this guy.
Hello?
Yes, who is it?
Look, you clearly have no idea who I am.
You only sent 10 of your men to take care of me.
If you touch one hair on Sarah's head I will do to you what I've just done to your men.
Understand?
I'm coming down there right now.
- Scary enough?
- I'm scared.
I was scared when you...
Rusty?
You're not rusty at all.
You are limber.
I suggest you start running, right about now.
Follow me.
That hurts.
I'm so out of spy shape.
What the hell are you doing here?
Saving your lives, okay?
Let's just go with that for now.
- Ahem, I'm good.
- Cut me free.
- I got some Russians to kill.
- Not yet.
There's one more thing I have to do.
I'm waiting for you, and I don't like to wait.
Boss, the Americans have escaped.
Chuck, why are we here?
The computer?
This is what you came here for?
Look, Sarah, I have to tell you the truth.
I took over my father's search for my mom.
She's a spy.
I thought I could find her, save her, bring her home.
- You should've told me.
- You would've tried to stop me.
Of course.
I don't want you to get hurt.
Sarah, I have to do this.
This is my mom, okay?
I need to know the truth.
No lying.
That was our rule.
In all fairness, I was just, you know, keeping a secret.
I wasn't lying.
No secrets, no lies.
- Starting now.
- Starting now.
Great, you've made up.
How do we get out of here?
You can't get out.
This is a living building, totally automated.
The security system is activated.
If you die, you die.
That sounds ominous.
Hope the file was worth it, Chuck.
We're sitting ducks in here.
Sorry, Mom.
- Chuck, what are you doing?
- I set off the EMP.
It disables the building.
We walk out of here.
But the computer, you'll lose the file.
You might never find your mom.
Yeah, well, it's not worth losing you.
Any of you.
Yeah, we get it.
Pull the trigger.
Okay, great.
Great plan.
Now what?
Now we deploy the best commie rifle ever invented, comrade AK-47.
Move it, move it.
Let's go, let's go.
- Everybody alive?
- I'm okay, I'm okay.
A little cold, but...
Anyone that matters?
Where's the getaway car?
Happy anniversary?
Happy anniversary.
So that's it.
That's the whole story.
Well, I'm just peeved you didn't ask us for help.
I'm sorry.
Will you help me find my mom?
Yes.
Yes, of course.
Chuck, you know what this means.
You're gonna have to rejoin the agency and be a spy.
I know.
The question is, do we tell Beckman about my mom?
No, not yet.
Chuck, what about your sister?
What are you gonna tell Ellie?
I have to tell her the truth.
I have to tell her that I am a spy.
- Chuck.
- Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.
That's okay.
How are you?
- The interview didn't go well?
- No, none of them, really.
There's something that I have to do, Ellie.
It's okay, Chuck.
I know.
- What?
- I saw the new Buy More.
Uh, right, yeah.
I did get a job there.
- Ellie, I'm not...
That's not...
- It's okay, Chuck.
It's a job.
Those are really hard to come by these days, so...
My turn.
Sit down.
Okay.
What's up?
I'm pregnant.
What?
Are you...?
What?
Seriously?
I was gonna wait until Devon got home, but I saw you and I had to tell you.
- Oh, my God.
Ha, ha.
- Ha, ha.
Oh, my God, I'm so happy for you.
Oh, my God, I'm hugging you.
- Did I hurt the baby?
- Stop.
- Have I hurt the child?
- Chuck.
- Oh, my God, that's amazing.
- I'm really happy right now, Chuck.
I mean, I'm starting a family a new family, and you have Sarah, and you're safe, and just...
I'm really so happy right now.
I couldn't tell her, not now.
She doesn't want me to be a spy but our dad gave me this mission to find our mom, to know the truth.
I can't not do this.
I have to do this.
That's not being a spy, that's being a brother.
I cracked into the deep database for your mom and this is all I could find.
Look at the top of the page.
- She was captured?
- Yeah.
And there's nothing else after that.
This whole time, Ellie and I thought that our mom left us because she didn't care about us.
But she was taken.
Are you gonna tell Ellie?
No.
No, not yet.
If my mom is still alive, I'm gonna find her and bring her home.
Why did you bring me here?
Found out some interesting information about you.
Someone's looking for you.
Who?
Your family.
Have you told Volkoff anything?
No, I told him nothing.
That's good.
That is very, very good.
Wait.
Please, I have a family.
So do I.
And the king was freed, and the castle was restored,
"and the Frost Queen returned home once more.
"This time, she was a hero.
"And the Frost Queen promised her children that she would never ever leave them again."
Good story?
I liked it.
The prince was cool.
Yes, he was.
Just like my little Chuck.
Mom?
Yeah?
Are you going away again?
Just for a few days, then right back to you and Ellie.
Good night, honey.
Love you.
Not nearly as much as I love you.
My mom was a spy.
After she disappeared, my father spent the rest of his life trying to find her.
Ellie and I thought she left us, that she just walked away, but what if we were wrong?
I need your help.
I need you to help me find my mom.
Holy cow!
I cannot belie this was beneath your house.
This is nuts!
A secret spy base.
I mean, it's got lasers and gadgets and... neatly organized files.
Hey, listen, why don't you just tell Casey and Sarah?
Because I know what they're gonna try and do;
they're gonna try and stop me.
They cannot.
I have to find the truth, Morgan- why my mom left, why she never came back.
This is my search.
No.
It's our search.
I'm in.
Thanks.
Yeah.
Are you flexing?
What?
No, I was just kinda...
I'm excited.
Okay, good, good.
I can't even tell you how much
I appreciate your help on this.
But listen, one very, very, very important thing:
we cannot tell anyone, not a soul.
Not Sarah, not Casey, not Awesome, not Ellie.
Not Ellie.
I get it, I know.
You promised her you weren't gonna be a spy, you know?
So she clearly cannot know about our little rogue spy team that we're gonna start here outside of the government, secret to the spy world, team of two, army of one, highway to the danger zone,
live free or die hard...
Buddy.
Yeah?
This is not the opening of a TV show.
This is real life.
âª âª
Hey, Sarah, honey, is this the gun you were looking for?
Yes, thank you.
I got everything, dude.
You ready to go?
She's still here?
Hurry up.
Yeah?
You're the best.
Thank you so much.
Mmm.
A spy mission without me.
Couples do this all the time, right?
It's just a business trip.
Are you okay with this?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm fine.
I'm, you know.
I' got job interviews and Morgan and I are gonna spend quality time.
He signed us up for a go-cart racing league, so...
Come home soon.
Mmm.
Ugh!
I'm gonna be sick.
Come on, Walker, we got real work to do.
Like se the free world.
Enjoy your retirement, Bartowski.
What am I, what do I say?
What do we...?
I love you.
That's good.
I love you.
I like that.
I love you, too.
Be safe, okay?
Nothing is gonna keep me from coming back to yo
Better not.
Bye.
Mr. Carmichael, we're all set.
I have our tickets, cloned passports, money belts.
Let's do this.
Back in the game.
Me and you, real spies.
Sunblock.
We need sunblock.
âª âª
Excuse me.
Very sorry.
Pardon me.
I knew it.
I was right.
My mom's safe house.
This is where she got all of her missions when I was a kid.
You kn, speaking as the bookkeer for our int checki account, it mightave been a bit more affoable iwe started here and then traveled e world.
ah, we, we dn't really kw about re, now did we?
u got the code, buddy?
Yeah.
Yeah, code, code, code.
Here y go.
Thanks.
Oh, and if we t second, we need to he a lile bit of a bget conversation just because...
Hey, Morga not now
This is it.
My dad never made it this far.
Okay, Mom, where are you?
And it's notght?
Please tell me that it's not empty.
I don't get it.
I don't get it.
All the intel led right back here.
No.
No, no, no, there's got to be something.
There's got to be something.
There's got to be a... a- a secret compartment, you know?
Or a passageway or some clue that finally leads us to my mom.
Yeah.
Come on.
Come on!
Come on!
There's nothing.
Okay, so we didn't find your mom, but, uh, maybe we found a new dumpling house, huh?
All right, I don'know.
Let's pack it up, head home.
Fuel up on some dumplings and start again from scratch, okay?
Now we can do this, you and I...
All right.
We got close this time.
I know we're going to find her.
Oh, Chuck.
Talk to me, buddy, you know?
Let it out.
You want to cry?
Go for it.
I got two good shoulders.
What are we doing?
Why are we even bothering looking for my mom?
My dad ruined his life trying to find her.
She could have come back any time she wanted to, you know?
We're easy to find.
Her, not so much.
I'm done, man.
I
- I think I'm done.
Listen, you had to try, right?
Don't move, Chuck.
Get over here!
Morgan.
Morgan, Morgan.
Coming, coming.
Give me them keys.
Yeah, here you go, sir.
Here they are.
Here are your keys.
Just don't, please don't shoot me or Chuck.
Look, if this is has anything to do with my mom or-or Albania or Tangiers, or that-that cafe in Budapest which was...
Oh, that was not even...
Anyway, the point is we have explanations for all of that.
What are you talking about?
I'm here for the car.
I'm a repo man!
Repo man.
Morgan?
Right.
We haven't made a payment in four months.
The car cost $900.
Yeah, but we're $43,000 in debt.
I was gonna...
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa!
What?
What?
43 what?
$43,000 debt, and that's...
that's above the CIA money you had saved up because being a spy, apparently is really expensive.
Why didn't you...
why didn't you tell me?
Well, you were so busy looking for your mom...
Enough chitchat.
Get away from that car.
Just, uh, Chuck, give him a little, you know what I mean, Intersect style.
I don't do kung fu anymore, buddy.
You got some chop-socky, boy?
No, no chop-socky here, sir.
Fresh out of chop-socky.
Take the car.
That's what I thought.
My advice: get a job!
Working on it.
You know, Chuck, this does not happen to real spies.
I'm cornered.
What do I do?
MAN Use the device.
Make a move and you're dead, Marko.
Please, make a move.
I thought you said the EMP was a fake.
I was wrong.
Beautiful, isn't it?
Volkoff Industries' handheld EMP generator.
Will fry every electric circuit in a three-klick radius.
Volkoff's upping the ante.
The building's elevators are knocked out.
Mr. Volkoff's agents will be here in minutes.
You're trapped.
Put down your guns.
You know, he really should be here.
Chuck's the Intersect.
We could use him on a mission like this.
I hate cracking into computer systems.
Well, he made a promise to his sister.
Chuck doesn't want to be a spy and have to lie about it, too.
Your boyfriend needs some big boy pants.
He's a spy, he's good at it.
I know, Casey.
You miss him, too.
What?
I don't miss him.
Freeze now!
Oh, by the way, good idea to bring the chutes.
Thank you.
âª âª
Yes, Chuck.
Yes.
Nice.
I like this.
But l-less back.
Maybe just kind of a...
Hold that.
Hold that.
Right there, this whole sleepy confusion thing.
That's digital sex right there, my friend.
Morgan, what are you doing?
I'm putting the spark back in your relationship, dude.
Trust me.
Sarah's going to love these.
What?
Good.
Yeah.
Actually, if you don't mind,
I'll hit the peck deck a little bit.
Oh, and, uh... put baby oil, please.
Lube it up.
What?
Ba-ba...
What?
Lube it up.
Lube it.
No, no, no.
Grease it up.
Whatever you're doing, please stop.
Okay.
Okay.
I know you're down about your mom, Chuck.
Let's you and I have a little talk right now, man-to-man.
Okay.
Okay.
Man-to-man talk.
What are you doing in my room with baby oil?
More importantly, you and Sarah, okay?
'Cause every morning you're waking up missing her, acting like a sad sack.
I mean, I-I understand a little bit, you know, you're-you're stuck in this long-distance relationship right now that's short on intimacy.
That's okay.
It's all right.
But what you need to do is open your mind to what sex truly is.
It's sexting.
Yeah.
Short for sext writing.
It's intimacy for people in your situation.
Sexting.
Sex... sexting.
Sexting.
Sexting.
Sexting.
Buddy.
Now that the terrible ids are t of the way,
I told Ellie about the job hunt, and she's already lined up five interviews for today.
Okay.
I'll grab our bus passes.
But, uh, remember, um, sexting?
Oh, yeah, sex talk?
No, not going to happen.
Good luck on the job hunt.
Fine.
Do it myself.
I am so glad you could come in.
You know, with a rÃ©sumÃ© like this and a degree from Stanford, uh... it's astounding you haven't been snatched up already.
Snatch me up.
I'm 100% snatchable.
I'm sorry, I don't use the word "snatch" very often for a myriad of reasons.
Relax.hy are you so nervous?
Uh... you know, I'm not normally.
I
- I'm normally...
I'm normally a smooth operator.
Like Sade.
But today has been a strange, uh, day of interviews.
Really?
Well, how?
Well, for starters, um, have you ever had anyone fall asleep in an interview?
Um, just after that, the person sitting in your position got a little ill.
Just after that, the interviewer started going into convulsions...
The last interview I just came from, they-they told me they were going for a cup of coffee, and then they never came back.
I mean, how long does it take to get coffee?
That's really crazy.
Yeah.
Well, um...
I think, Chuck, that I have some good news for you.
Good.
Yeah.
How would you like to join...?
I thought I told them to hold my calls.
I
- I, uh...
I...
I don't think it's a good idea for you to answer that.
Hello.
Yes.
It's about you.
What?
Is... is everything okay?
What's happening?
Who is that?
Uh... unfortunately, Mr. Bartowski, the position's been filled.
What's happening?
Who was that?
And I'm going to have security escort you from the building.
Wait.
I'm s...
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Hang on a second.
What did I do?
Who was that on the phone?
Perhaps I could explain whatever the situation is.
Gentlemen, this is completely uncalled-for.
Look on the bright side, Chuck.
The bus has much more legroom than the hatchback.
There's a conspiracy against me.
I don't know.
I... always feel that way after a bad interview.
Except, with me, the conspiracy has been going on a lot longer.
You know?
Like, kindergarten.
Morgan, what am I supposed to do now?
These were Ellie's best leads.
Where am I going to find a job?
Well, there's...
always one place.
Where?
I can't believe it's back, Chuck.
âª âª
It's beautiful.
I can't believe how fast they rebuilt it.
Oh my...
Lord.
Welcome to the Buy More.
We're not open yet, but... but we are currently accepting rÃ©sumÃ©s.
Are you interested?
For what?
A job.
Maybe.
What-what, uh, types of positions are available?
I'm sure the store manager can help you with that.
Have at it.
Good luck.
So nervous.
Do you want me to show you around the store?
Yes, please.
That would be delightful.
Should I hold your hand?
No, you should not.
Okay.
Lead on.
Um...
Hello.
My name is Chuck Bartowski, and, uh... it's funny, uh...
I
- I used to work here.
You still do work here.
Hello, Chuck.
Welcome back.
Beckman had kittens when I told her about the EMP.
She wants us to find out where Volkoff's building it so we can blow the place up.
Another mission?
We've been at it for months, and I haven't seen Chuck in...
forever.
There's something else.
Beckman wants Chuck to come down here, take a look at the EMP, see if he flashes.
Chuck is a civilian now.
We can't force him to be a spy, can we?
You might want to tell Beckman that yourself.
Oh, Chuck.
As you can see, we spared no expense recreating the Buy More.
Um, yeah, uh, General,
I
- I appreciate the tour and all...
It's no longer simply a retail store.
It's now a full-fledged CIA-NSA substation.
We can patch into security cameras all over the world.
Satellite relays-
NORAD, NASA, Strategic Air Command.
Hit that red button, we go to DEFCON 1.
Is that, uh...
is that really the safest place to put that- out in the open?
There's a new laser-based security system.
General, this is crazy.
You realize this is crazy.
No, it's not.
After the success of Operation Bartowski, the president made you a priority.
I beg your pardon.
The-the-the president president?
Like, the actual...
You're being totally serious.
General, I am out of the spy game.
You're out when I say you're out.
If memory serves, you actually said,
"Chuck, you are out of the spy game."
I changed my mind.
You're back.
Discussion over.
And don't think you're going to find another job.
Why...?
You... you... you.
That was you on the phone, wasn't it?
You tanked my interviews, didn't you?
Oh.
Hi, Sarah.
Back in town?
Chuck, listen to me.
You do not have to be a spy.
Oh, no, no.
I know.
Yeah.
Beckman just offered me a position, and I turned her down.
How did she react?
Well, she...
Chuck, hello?
Hey.
Hey.
That went well, I think.
I'm...
I'm sorry.
I should have called, but we just got in.
No, hey, it's fine- 'cause you're here, and I'm here, and... and I miss you a lot.
Mmm.
Mmm.
Mmm.
I missed you, too.
This is the mission that just won't end.
I get it.
It's important work, okay?
But you're here now at least for a little while, right?
Few weeks?
Days?
Hours?
Enough sap.
Hey, Sarah, what...
Let's take a look at the mission at hand.
What are you...?
Flash.
Gah!
Hah!
Well?
Thanks, Casey.
EMP- uh, manufactured in Venezuela at the Corta Verona facility, which is a subsidiary of Volkoff Industries.
Who's Volkoff?
Don't tell me.
Alexei Volkoff- arms dealer, recluse.
He's like the Russian Howard Hughes.
We've been chasing after him for months, and with that single flash, we might just be able to take him down.
Good to have you back.
Oh, I'm not staying.
I think he misses you.
Oh, I know he does.
This is nuts, man.
The Buy More is being run by the CIA.
Amazing.
Which would make you a spy, huh?
You are very perceptive, Mr. Grimes.
Guilty.
I got to say, the new Castle is pretty freaking sweet.
And it's nice to be back down in here with u.
Chuck, can we talk?
Of course.
Anytime.
About what?
Well, I know this is awkward, but, um...
I just have to ask about the picture.
What, uh... what picture?
Hi-oh.
Chuck, do you want to sext with me?
Ah!
No!
I don't...
I mean...
I...
No.
No, no.
No, uh, this... this isn't my idea.
Cleary not my idea.
This was Morgan's doing.
Well, don't worry.
I...
I thought it was cute.
Here's the thing- I don't know if you know this, but, uh, I actually was an agent myself for a little while last year.
What if we got together, maybe... show each other a few moves?
You know, I...
I have a trip to Thailand in the morning.
Mmm.
Sure.
Sure.
It's a new mission.
Oh, of course.
It's the life of a...
I could show you something right now.
Really?
Yeah.
You know.
So, six/nine-month anniversary.
What do you think?
Well, I-I have to go away again, but when I come back, we will celebrate in style.
Fantastic.
No phones necessary.
No.
Unless you want.
No.
I don't know what that means.
Uh, forget I even said anything.
Hey, hey, hey.
What-what... what is.. what is...
what is this?
The emblem?
That's Volkoff's.
He is not afraid to advertise.
Well, I have to go debrief with Beckman and Casey, but we'll talk later?
Yeah, great.
Whoa.
New Buy More rules.
Slides and trap doors and the new superspy/Nerd Herder, Greta.
Be still, my beating heart.
She digs me.
I can tell.
Morgan.
Uh-huh?
We need to get the car back.
Uh, with the creepy guy?
Okay, I'm sorry.
Again, tell me why we're here.
I mean, this menu's linked to an arms dealer?
Look, I thought the last mission was a bust, okay?
But the menu could be the link that brings us to my mom.
Maybe she was after Volkoff just like Casey and Sarah.
Okay, listen, I get the menu- we get out of here quietly.
Yes, yes, quick and quiet.
There it is.
You young, oversexed, underworked kids.
You don't mess with a repo man.
Not ever!
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir, Mr. repo man, sir.
We are not here to mess with you.
We just...
Morgan, get the... get the... get the menu!
Oh, repo man, Excuse me for one second.
I'm just going to just, very slowly...
I'm just going to kind of...
He's just reaching...
Here we go.
Here we go.
Perfect.
Please, this is all we want and then we're leaving.
We're out of your hair.
You want a menu, for what?
Chinese.
Dumplings.
Oh, yeah?
A good place?
No.
It's...
No.
No.
I like good Chinese.
Hard to find.
Hand it over.
Buddy, you remember how we got out of that jam in Tangiers?
Tangiers?
Think it'll work?
Tangiers?
What does that mean?
It means that we need to run!
Run!
RunRun!
Run!
Damn you!
I love dumplings.
It's really weird.
Most of these are just your run-of-the-mill dishes, but a few of these I haven't even heard of before.
Which ones?
Which dishes?
For example, this.
Shimira Chicken.
Ah, Shimira.
Okay, Shimira is actually a nav system for spy subs.
This is not a menu for ordering food.
This is a menu for ordering weapons.
Why would your mom have that?
Let's call and find out.
Use your dad's encrypted phone.
Okay.
Let's see here.
Who is this?
Identify.
This is Carmichael.
I work for the Ring.
The Ring was eliminated.
We are an offshoot of the Ring.
The New Ring.
I'm the head of security.
I'll need to see your organization firsthand if we agree to work.
Then you'll have to come to Volkoff Industries in Moscow.
Moscow, Russia.
Not a problem.
The New Ring has very deep pockets.
We're going to Russia.
Okay.
I'm going to have to sell my Millennium Falcon.
And God bless you.
Yes, I'm here.
Just tell me when and where.
We have a jet on standby.
Okay, so we I.D. Volkoff's facility and then we can take it out with a single drone strike.
Have you ever been in a long-distance relationship?
No.
I either leave or they die.
I'm going to the head.
âª âª
WOMAN Please fasten your seat belts.
We're heading into a bit of turbulence.
Release the gas.
I'll reroute the flight to Moscow.
Where are we?
Desolation, frostbite.
Must be Russia.
Welcome to Volkoff Industries.
I'm glad you could finally make it.
Take a load off.
Relax.
And think about all the terrible things
I will do to you.
We're pros, Marko.
Your methods won't work on us.
Remember, I work for Volkoff.
I must break you.
Remember the plan.
We have to access the Volkoff computer system to see what they have on my mom.
Does that make sense?
Completely.
Although I think my face is still frozen.
Hello.
We're with the Ring.
The New Ring.
This is Charles Carmichael.
I'm Michael Carmichael.
So, if you wouldn't mind...
Frigid in here, as well.
Wow.
The plan was for me to be Carmichael and you to be Sven, my mute assistant.
See, here's the thing.
These people respect a beard.
And that whole assistant thing...
I don't know.
I see us more as brothers.
Is that so?
Okay, okay, fine.
What parents in their right mind would name their child Michael if their last name was Carmichael?
That's crazy.
What were your parents thinking?
What were our parents thinking?
You know.
It's what people in the movie business call improv.
Nice photo.
Good work, Walker.
Get the phone.
Okay.
I know where the server is.
It's actually not far from where we are.
If my father's codes still work, we should be able to get in.
What do you think?
Uh, maybe you drop a little Intersect style on these fools.
Karate chop your way in.
I will hide behind the receptionist desk.
You know, that, or we could just run really fast.
Tangiers?
Here?
Tangiers.
Exactly.
Ah, could work.
The case.
One, two, three.
We go.
Come on, come on, come on, come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
I almost got it.
Oh.
I've never run so fast in so many layers before.
Game time.
Yup.
This place is nuts.
Yeah, it's a Cold War relic, buddy.
Oh, dude, what is this?
Morgan, that's an EMP, so I wouldn't touch that.
This is an EMP?
Yes, it is.
No touching, Morgan.
Got ya.
Got ya.
Good work, Walker.
Call Beckman.
No, I can't call.
It's gonna be too loud.
I'll text Chuck.
I was texting before.
Your phone.
Yeah, I'm kind of busy right now.
Oh.
Sarah.
She's sexting you.
Not now, Morgan.
Got ya.
Go on... my lady.
What does he say?
He thinks we're sexting.
What?
What does that even mean?
SOS.
SOS.
Skin on skin.
Yes, please.
Oh, come on.
Filthy.
He still thinks we're sexting.
You kiss your mom with those thumbs?
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God.
Daddy likes.
Oh, you're in trouble.
Daddy likes.
Hey, someone's coming.
We're inside Volkoff.
Subbasement four.
Tell him!
Okay.
Got it.
Bypassed their security.
I'm in.
Awesome.
Awesome.
Anything?
Well, there's nothing coming up with her name, but I'm checking aliases, missions my dad thought she went on or weapons she was after.
Hang on.
Hang on.
Wait a minute.
Frost.
Frost.
The Frost Queen.
My mom used to tell me a stories when I was a kid about the Frost Queen.
That can't be it.
Well, either way, let's download it and get out of here.
It's encrypted.
It's encrypted.
But I have a program that can hack it, and then we can download it.
Right.
Uh, quickly.
Wait a minute.
Oh, crap.
What?
It's Sarah, but it's...
I
- I thought she was sexting, dude.
She's here with Casey, and they're in trouble.
Dude, what do we do?
Call Beckman.
I'll call Beckman, or CIA, or the Marines, because someone's got to save 'em.
Who's gonna save 'em?
We are.
Enough with the toes.
No one's coming.
I would love nothing more than to put bullets in both your heads.
Yeah, go ahead and do it.
Don't jabber.
Just do it.
The problem is you're not the two agents I'm looking for.
In the past six months, two CIA agents have gotten closer to Volkoff Industries than any other spy.
They're ghosts.
They expertly use public transportation to avoid being tracked.
So tell me who are these master spies?
No idea.
Never seen 'em.
Morgan, this way.
Back, back, back, back, back, back, back.
MAN We've got them - they're in the building.
They're here.
They must have come for you.
Well, that's their first mistake.
This entire building...
is a trap.
So, buddy, how rusty is your kung fu?
I haven't used it in months.
Great.
So... do you want to speak to your friend?
Chuck, what's going on?
What are you doing here?
Sarah, I know you must have a lot of questions for me right now, and I promise I will explain everything later.
Listen, you've got to flash, okay?
You've got to get out of here.
I've heard enough.
No, please, this is a big mistake.
He's not a spy.
Kill them.
No, please, no.
Well, it all seemed a bit anticlimactic.
I'm gonna tear you limb from limb from limb.
Okay, I got it.
Somebody please shoot this guy?
CHUCK Hello?
Uh... yes, who is it?
Look, you clearly have no idea who I am since you only sent ten of your men to take care of me, so let me break it down for you:
if you touch one hair on Sarah's head,
I will do to you what I've just done to your men.
Do you understand?
I'm coming down there right now.
Scary enough?
I'm scared.
I was scared when you...
You are not rusty at all, Chuck.
You are limber.
I suggest you start running... right about now.
Follow me.
Aah... that hurts.
I'm so out of spy shape.
What the hell are you doing here?
Saving your lives, okay?
Let's just call it that for now.
I'm good.
Cut me free.
I got some Russians to kill.
Not yet- there's one more thing I have to do.
I'm waiting for you, and I don't like to wait.
MAN Boss, the Americans have escaped.
Chuck, why are we here?
What, the computer?
This is what you came here for?
Look, Sarah, I have to tell you the truth.
I took over my father's search for my mom.
She's a spy, she is a spy, I-I don't know.
I thought I could find her, I could save her, I could bring her home.
You should have told me.
You would have tried to stop me.
Of course I would have.
I don't want you to get hurt.
Sarah, I have to do this.
This is my mom, okay, I need to know the truth.
No lying- that was our rule.
In all fairness, I was just, you know, keeping a secret.
I wasn't lying.
New rule:
no secrets, no lies.
Starting now.
Great, you've made up.
Now, how do we get out of here?
MARKO You can't get out.
This is a living building, totally automated.
The security system is activated.
If you die, you die.
That sounds ominous.
Hope the file was worth it, Chuck.
We're sitting ducks in here.
Sorry, Mom.
Chuck, what are you doing?
If I set off the EMP, it disables the building and we walk out of here.
But, Chuck, the computer.
You'll lose the file.
You might never find your mom.
Yeah, well, it's not worth losing you.
Any of you.
Yeah, we get it.
Pull the trigger.
Okay, great, great plan.
Now what?
Now we employ the best commie rifle ever invented
- Comrade AK-47.
âª âª
Move it.
Move it.
Everybody alive?
I'm okay, I'm okay, a little cold, but...
Anyone that matters?
Where's the getaway car?
Happy anniversary?
Happy anniversary.
So that's it.
That's the whole story.
Well, I'm just peeved you didn't ask us for help.
I'm sorry.
Will you help me find my mom?
Yes.
Yes, of course.
But, Chuck, you know what this means.
You're going to have to rejoin the Agency and be a spy.
I know.
The question is:
do we tell Beckman about my mom?
Mm-mm.
No, not yet.
Chuck, what about your sister?
What are you going to tell Ellie?
I have to tell her the truth.
I have to tell her that I am a spy.
âª âª
Chuck.
Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.
Oh, that's okay.
How are you?
The interview didn't go well?
No, none of 'em, really, but there's something that I have to do, Ellie.
It's okay, Chuck.
I know.
What?
I saw the new Buy More.
Uh, right, yeah, I did get a job there.
Ellie, I'm not- that's not what I...
It's okay, Chuck.
It's a job.
Those are really hard to come by these days, so...
My turn.
Let's sit down.
Okay.
What's up?
I'm pregnant.
What?
Are you- what, seriously?
!
I
- I was going to wait until Devon got home, but I, I saw you and I had to tell you.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, I'm so- oh, my God, I'm hugging you.
Uh, I- am I- did I hurt the baby?
I hurt the child.
Chuck.
Oh, my God, that's amazing.
I'm really happy right now, Chuck.
I mean, I'm starting a family- a new family- and you have Sarah and you're safe and... just I'm really so happy right now.
I couldn't tell her, not now.
She doesn't want me to be a spy, but my dad gave me this mission to find our mom, to know the truth.
I can't not do this.
I have to do this.
That's not being a spy, that's being a brother.
I cracked into the deep database for your mom and this is all I could find.
Look at the top of the page.
She was captured?
Yeah, and there's nothing else after that.
This whole time, Ellie and I thought that our mom left us because she didn't care about us, but she was taken.
Are you going to tell Ellie?
No.
No, not yet.
If my mom is still alive,
I'm going to find her and bring her home.
Why did you bring me here?
I found out some interesting information about you.
Someone is looking for you.
Who?
Your family.
Have you told Volkoff anything?
No, I told him nothing.
That's good.
That is very, very good.
Please.
I have a family.
So do I.

[Attorney Seo In Woo]
Episode 12
Let's meet, come to the break lounge.
Is something wrong?
Why were you so late?
I'm sorry.
I don't mean to censure you, it's just that you don't look very good.
Well, it's nothing.
There's nothing wrong.
Your father's case has already ended, is there something else bothering you?
No, there's nothing wrong.
Prosecutor Ma.
Well, I'm just... a little...
Some other time.
Alright.
Later on, when you feel like saying, and if you need help, tell me.
Alright.
What is Madam Han Jung Ran hiding?
What exactly did Go Man Chul exchange to get that piece of land?
Madam Han Jung Ran you know, don't you?
No,
I don't know anything about it.
After 9 pm,
I was drinking with Go Man Chul, a junior from my hometown.
For the murder case,
Dad's alibi, was provided by Go Man Chul and Han Jung Ran, a piece of land was given away, something must have been hidden...
Are you feeling sick, Prosecutor?
Well, yes.
I'm exhausted.
I'll read this at home.
I'm leaving now.
I'll be leaving work first today.
I see.
You're rather serious about exercising.
Sunbae, are you leaving now?
Yes, I haven't bought Bin's present yet.
You mustn't buy the same present as last year.
What did I get?
A doll set.
You bought the same thing the year before as well.
Ah, I did?
I'll become someone who puts you at ease.
I could just go my own way, but how can I leave you on your own when you botch up so many things?
So, I'll just become a friend who puts you at ease.
A friend's good, right?
Not bad, right?
Okay?
Okay.
Despicable fellow.
Where did he disappear to all of a sudden?
Private matters cannot be randomly told to anyone.
Private matters cannot be randomly told to anyone.
That's right,
Lawyer Seo and I have no ties between us.
Wake up, Ma Hye Ri, wake up.
Anyhow...
Lawyer Seo wouldn't do this to me.
Did something happen to Prosecutor Ma recently?
It seems so, but I don't know what.
She wouldn't tell me.
Maybe she doesn't feel at ease with me.
She doesn't tell me what's in her heart.
Prosecutor Jin, it's the same with you, right?
Who?
You think me too?
You don't think so?
When you were new in the office, you shared a lot with me.
When was that?
Was that my wife's friend or junior?
When we set-up you and that guy, was it after your third meeting?
You were totally drunk when you came to our place, you told my wife, when you were totally drunk, remember?
Stop that.
Unni, you already found the ideal guy I like.
When did I say that?
Why would you remember something like that?
Sunbae, really.
After that, when Bin's mom died, you started becoming like an adult.
What do you mean like an adult?
You never showed your suffering, but cared for others.
Why didn't you mention you were coming home?
What's up?
What's up?
Because I missed you, Mom.
Oh, suddenly, it feels like a hero's homecoming.
I must be extremely popular.
Why?
Other than me, who else likes you so much?
Who else?
Your dad.
Is he nice to you?
He didn't get angry, he just kept quiet.
That was right after the divorce paper ruckus.
Ah!
That's great.
Why are you looking around so curiously?
As if it's your first time here.
Mom,
Dad...
What kind of a man was he?
Mom, you and Dad got married out of love, right?
Loved to death.
Amongst all the men who were courting me, he was the best.
Manly, with a good appetite.
Mom, you don't know much about Dad's business, assets or things like that, right?
I don't, of course.
So long as I get the monthly living expenses on time, and I get to use credit cards and such.
My dad's not a bad person, is he?
Of course, it's only because there have been life changes.
In the past, he used to be so romantic.
But what is this ill-mannered stuff you're talking about?
"A bad person?"
How can you use such a crass term about your dad?
Ah!
How could I be so crass?
Oh!
Honey.
What brings you here?
Dad.
Haven't you been doing your facials?
Your skin doesn't look that good.
Ah!
Not as frequently as I used to.
She's too absorbed in her prosecutor job, so maybe she has no time.
You can have them come to your house, you know.
Get facials at home.
Alright.
Why?
Did something happen at the Prosecutor Office?
No, nothing special.
That's good then.
Dad, what about you?
Nothing happened to you, right?
I never knew this before, to live with nothing special happening, that's a very good thing.
Oh, why is this child speaking like an old person now?
She's mature now.
That's why they must get a job in society.
But it still makes me sad.
To make our Hye Ri so mature, it must have taken lots of difficult experiences.
This child used to be so naive and so pure.
And you're proud of that?
Yes, nothing will happen.
Don't be ill-at-ease.
It will be fine.
This is so great, better than sleeping with my husband.
It's been so long since I slept with you, Mom.
When you said you wanted to sleep with me like this, it really felt like you were going off to be married.
You told me to live at home even after marriage, that's why you built such a large house, right?
That was my dream at that time.
Oh!
It's not a dream now.
If you married Lawyer Seo, you can move back home.
Lawyer Seo?
Yes.
Isn't that right?
His father lives in America, right?
Mom, you know...
After you two get married, will your father-in-law come live in Korea?
That's not it.
Then?
Mom,
I think I'm truly in love with Lawyer Seo.
You mean you didn't like him that much before?
I did but,
I had no idea I liked him this much.
I liked him but, I didn't know I liked him so much.
Hye Ri.
Mom.
What's wrong?
Did you quarrel?
Lawyer Seo made you sad?
I miss him.
Here, Bin, eat up.
Happy Birthday.
Granny made lots of nice food for you.
And this is your present.
I don't want it.
Give it to me later.
Later, I can't be there, you know.
Birthday presents are to be given at the party, right?
Like last year.
Today, I have a really important appointment.
But every year at Bin's birthday, you always eat and party together, right?
Who are you meeting with?
A friend.
Which friend?
I have friends whom you don't know.
You have friends I don't know about?
Jung Seon, do you have another boyfriend?
What do you mean?
If that is not true, why would you be meeting someone else on Bin's birthday?
Don't presume you know all about your daughter now.
So you didn't go to view the cherry blossoms with Prosecutor Yoon?
No!
Then you went alone?
Going there alone...
It's not a place to go alone, you know.
So you went with a guy.
I knew it, I knew it.
Who was it?
Mom, I'm going to the bathroom;
I have a stomach ache.
Shin Jung Nam is the sole witness of that murder case.
According to that man's statement,
Dad is not the perpetrator.
Even if Dad did give a piece of land to Go Man Chul, there must be some other reason for that.
Hello.
Is the owner, Shin Jung Nam, here?
Yes, that's me.
Hello.
I came to ask you something.
Do you still remember from 15 years ago, about the murder case that happened?
You made a statement as an eye-witness in the case, didn't you?
Father, I forgot to get the flower pot.
Prosecutor!
Oh!
How are you?
I did hit someone but it was not to start a fight,
I did it to save a lady.
You're Shin Dong Ha, right?
During my investigation, she was the prosecutor.
Oh, I see.
Hello, Prosecutor.
I am the lawyer for defendant Shin Dong Ha.
I'm Lawyer Seo In Woo.
At that time, your lawyer was Lawyer Seo In Woo, correct?
Yes.
He found the evidence;
that's how Dong Ha got released.
Yes but, how did you appoint him for your son's case?
Did you know him from before?
He was a frequent customer who came weekly for flowers.
We didn't know he was a lawyer.
Flowers?
Not sure if it was for his parent's grave, or whose grave, for almost a year now, he comes every week.
Oh.
So how did he get appointed for the case?
From another earlier case, I found out he was a lawyer, so I asked for his help.
Ah!
But Prosecutor, why have you come to my house?
She's here for the bonsai.
Send that thing over quickly.
During my patrol, I saw a light in the trailer so I went to check it out.
So was that where you witnessed the murder case?
What I saw was after the murder took place.
A man was down;
I saw the perpetrator with his hands stained with blood.
Hello?
Someone's been killed over here.
The criminal was that man alright.
But my dad, why did he give land to the guy who provided an alibi for him?
Yes, Sunbaenim?
Sunbae Yoon's daughter is having her birthday?
Yes.
Maybe because recently you seem to be out of sorts, Prosecutor Ma, so Sunbae chose not to tell you.
But anyway I thought you should know about it, so I called.
I see.
Thank you.
At 6 pm, there's a birthday party at the pizza shop.
You know where that is, right?
Yes, I do.
Whether you go or not, you discuss it with Yoon sunbae.
That's all.
Who is the man in your heart?
If you're just playing around with Yoon sunbae, stop it.
Don't make him sad.
She's here after all.
Why isn't she going inside?
Why is she out?
Don't tell me Yoon sunbae's not here yet?
You know my name, right?
Should I know your name?
Don't you know me?
Who are you?
So why did you come here?
To apologize, and to congratulate.
How can you apologize and congratulate at the same time?
You think so?
Actually,
I'm here to congratulate, but I think I should apologize first.
To who?
To someone I like.
I just found out, to like and to fall for someone are two different things.
What are those two talking about?
Bin wasn't even surprised.
What?
Sunbae, I came here but...
I can't bring myself to go in.
I feel bad about Yoon sunbae,
I did something wrong towards him so...
Shut up right now.
Come out, turn right and keep walking.
Don't look back, just walk out naturally.
Ma Hye Ri.
I think I went crazy.
Yes, Sunbaenim?
Is it a very important appointment?
What?
If it's not a very important appointment, come and cheer up Bin.
Bin, can't you tell us why you're so sad?
Here, Bin.
A friend of mine and your dad's passed me this to give to you, she wanted to wish you Happy Birthday.
Who?
What is this?
It's a book reader.
It was someone who knew you loved to read.
Are there many books in here?
Wow, there are so many books here.
More than even a thousand.
Wow, Ahjumma, is this a present from my mom?
Just now, I saw someone who looked exactly like my mom.
Someone who looked exactly like your mom?
So sorry, Sunbaenim, I think I was out of line today.
The person Bin saw was Prosecutor Ma?
I was the one who told Prosecutor Ma about Bin's birthday.
Why?
It's just something I thought I should do.
Prosecutor Ma also tells me about the dates she goes with you.
I thought if it was Prosecutor Ma, sooner or later Bin would have to get to know her.
And I thought you had intended to invite Prosecutor Ma but hadn't.
Anyway, I was being too cavalier.
Being cavalier?
I'm even worse than you.
I thought I was the only one who noticed she looked like Bin's mom.
I felt sad and uncomfortable, but I'd feel amazed and happy too,
I was getting all confused.
I never considered how Bin would feel.
If we had told her earlier, things would have worked out better.
I still find him very handsome.
Anyone looking at you will think you've gone crazy, mumbling to yourself like that.
Sunbae, it's because you're too handsome as you walked over.
You wanted to see me to tell me I'm very handsome?
No.
Then?
I... those I like and those I dislike,
I'm someone who makes things very definite and clear.
Definite and clear are similar adjectives.
Yes.
But Sunbae, you're clearly very handsome, definitely so.
I really thought I had fallen for you...
I didn't want to explain all this;
these aren't the things I wanted to say.
Oh, how should I put it?
I was the one who first...
Stop it.
You don't have to explain, I understand.
You don't understand.
Even though it's all in your heart, but I knew the one you liked maybe wasn't me.
Have you eaten?
Why didn't you eat before you left?
Thank you.
Your present was well-received.
Bin likes it very much.
I thought if she's well-read, she wouldn't turn out like me.
And what's wrong with you?
Isn't my understanding sometimes limited?
Hey, you need to put on some weight.
Sit down.
Drink this now.
It soothes your soul... a warm cocoa.
Why are you looking at me like this?
Are you crying?
Why are you looking at me like that?
So cheekily.
Why are you over there?
Because this is my house.
Oh!
This.
Ma Hye Ri, wake up!
Ma Hye Ri!
You need to carpool!
Ma Hye Ri!
You need to go meet Prosecutor Yoon!
What are you looking at?
Go wash up!
It's Lawyer Seo!
It's Lawyer Seo!
Where have you been?
What happened?
Did something happen to you?
How can you be like that?
If you're going somewhere, you should say where you're going.
Why do I have to say those things?
Of course you have to say those things.
Do you know how long I've waited for you?
I had nobody to talk to; it was scary.
I was so anxious.
Where I'm going, what I'm doing... is our relationship such that I need to tell you?
What's wrong?
I know there's nothing going on between us, but...
Then that's that.
Let's go in, I'm tired.
Lawyer Seo.
What's up with him?
Yeah, I'm back.
Just now.
Really?
Good job.
Lawyer Seo, come on out.
Come on out.
I have something to say.
Hurry and open the door.
What?
Let's talk.
Let's just stop.
Are you coming out or shall I come in?
Why don't you come outside?
Why aren't you answering me?
Is your pride picking a fight with my pride?
Say what you want to say.
You have to answer for me to continue talking.
Stop asking me questions and asking for answers; it's annoying.
I didn't come out here to have a conversation with you.
I was dragged out by your stubbornness.
Stubbornness?
Are you saying I forced you?
You know what stubbornness is?
What you're doing right now is stubbornness.
Do you see me as some dog, pig, cow or sheep?
Is that why after leaving without a word, you come back and then...
"What are you?"
"A dog?
A pig?
A cow?
A sheep?"
"Why are you just hanging around, blocking the road?"
Is that what you're saying to me?
You said to contact you anytime.
I had some work to do, and because I had work to do, I had to go somewhere.
And so, I cleaned up the little details around me.
Are you saying I'm one of those "little details"?
You're really funny.
Can you just clean up your attachments to people as though you were sweeping them up with a broom?
I can.
So tacky.
What?
Using those kinds of cheap tactics to hurt someone...
It's not like you.
You're probably thinking I'm not the woman you'll end up with, and there's Prosecutor Yoon.
So, it seems you're just trying to clean up your feelings for a woman you have no chance with.
But you couldn't hate me that much.
You just couldn't do that.
You liked me enough to follow me to this place.
You don't think it's a misunderstanding?
I don't.
Because there's no other reason.
The world is not as simple as you think.
There aren't only the simple things your mind is capable of imagining.
However, none of that changes anything.
Lawyer Seo, you don't dislike me.
What's the real reason you're acting like this?
Stop messing around and stop right there.
You better not disappear again!
I'll kill you.
Hey, you said we were friends.
You even came when I told you not to.
And when I really needed you, you disappeared.
Ma Hye Ri.
You've never tasted my wrath;
don't even think about moving.
You make me sink so low, but I feel so much calmer now.
Now that I know you're there,
I feel relieved.
I really can't understand you.
Are you hungry?
Let's go out.
So why did you come back here?
I didn't feel like moving again.
It's been a while since you've been there so you should have jetlag.
Yeah.
Your parents really miss you.
We don't have birth parents anymore, but we do have our adoptive parents.
Ma Hye Ri seems to be having a tough time by herself.
Who can she talk to about her father?
Moreover, it involves a murder case too.
How much has she figured out?
Not much, give her more time.
I'm beginning to wonder if it'll remain buried forever.
That won't happen.
It concerns her father, you know.
"Once I figure out everything, then I'll decide how to proceed."
How can you be so sure?
Because I would do the same thing.
I wouldn't.
If it was me, I would pretend not to know and just live comfortably.
For the Han Ji Won case, we're summoning witnesses again, then we'll hand it over to the respective jurisdictions.
Alright, do that.
Prosecutor Ma, I have something to say.
Yes, go ahead, Chief.
You have a good memory, right?
I hear it's really good.
Then you will remember... we still don't trust you completely.
Yes, I told you that time as well.
It'd be a burden if you did trust me.
Okay good, we're on the same page.
You know what kind of character I hate the most?
- Someone who regresses.
- That's right.
Leaving work early, cases being delayed.
Have you exchanged your brain for a designer bag?
I thought you were getting better, but is the old Ma Hye Ri coming back?
Chief, these days, Prosecutor Ma...
You're only a teeny-weeny bit better than you were when you started out, it's not because of some amazing improvement I praised you, you know.
I'll improve my work.
Go on out.
Prosecutor Ma these days...
Prosecutor Ma these days, what?
What?
What?
Are you two in it together?
Why are you on her side?
I hate that.
- No, that's not it.
- That's not...
What is this?
You two are a set now, so Prosecutor Ma is the ugly duckling?
Is that why she's acting that way?
Sunbaenims...
Why?
Do I have something on my face?
Is my make-up flaking off?
Ah, yes.
It's hard to just ignore it.
Prosecutor Ma, just say it, what's going on?
You got pushed out of the trio?
I knew Prosecutor Jin had those skills.
Someone with your flamboyant style has no bite.
No, it's not like that.
Don't lose your faith to love and do something stupid.
Once it passes, it's all suffering.
That's...
There's nothing going on with me.
I haven't gotten a facial or gone to yoga in a month, so my bio-rhythm is off.
Why are you so down?
You know the Bureau Chief has a plan for everything, right?
Of course.
Should I teach you how to get back on the Bureau Chief's good side?
Have another house party.
Then I'll tell you.
You bring the kimchi.
Of course.
Deal.
Prosecutor Ma, be strong.
Fighting.
Here, eat.
Your conversation with Hye Ri, what was the outcome?
About what?
In this world, there are two kinds of people:
people observant, who know what to do, and people who, until asked, don't say anything.
I don't know what you're talking about.
There are projects that cause headaches, but I don't want to be the kind of father who holds on to his daughter by the collar.
I was just being patient.
So now, you're just relaxing?
Honey, what in the world are you talking about?
Hye Ri!
Hye Ri!
You said you would convince Hye Ri to get her own wedding plans moving forward.
We decided Hye Ri won't go on any match-making dates.
You said she didn't have to go.
Who?
Me?
Well... you... you... couldn't give up on me... so you...
- the divorce papers...
- Bring those divorce papers right now!
Totally useless, senseless wife.
I can't stand to look at you anymore!
Let's get them signed!
Fine!
Let's do it!
Getting rid of your useless wife and using your valuable daughter,
I don't want to be with that kind of man either.
Wha...
What did you just say?
I'm using my daughter?
You're totally using her.
Honey, you are exactly the same as Shim Chung's father who sold his daughter for 300 sacks of rice.
Hey, Park Ae Ja!
How dare you compare me to Shim Chung's father!
Using your daughters entirely for your gain, it's exactly the same.
Hey, Shim Chung, that guy...
Ma Hye Ri's father is... worse than Shim Chung's father.
At least Sim Chung's father was blind.
Ma Hye Ri's father is full of greed and using his daughter.
You...
Are you finished?
What is life?
What makes it special?
Being full and warm, feeling at ease...
Why are you so greedy?
Your daughter said she doesn't want that.
Why else would she have moved away?
Oh, Lawyer Seo!
Are you leaving for work now?
Is there something going on with you?
Or are you mad at me?
Have I done something wrong?
Tell me.
If I did something wrong, you have to tell me so I'll know.
Are you upset because I told you to move a while back?
Does Jenny not want us to be friends?
Did she say we shouldn't even acknowledge one another?
- Just stop!
- Oh, you scared me!
Just stop.
So... tell me why, all of a sudden... why are you treating me like this?
Tell me.
I did tell you.
I'm finished with you.
Well, whatever...
I never asked him to do anything.
Why all of a sudden... is he finished?
What do you want with a 15 year old case?
Ah, well, it's very similar to a case I have right now.
I want use it as a reference.
What are you curious about?
Just ask.
The records show that the culprit, Seo Dong Gun, denied the charges until the end.
He did.
But an eye witness... a motive for the crime...
the murder weapon... they're all there.
What's the sense in denying it?
Seo Dong Gun wasn't that kind of person.
Was he someone you knew very well?
When you live in the same neighborhood, you get to know each other well.
Ah, I see.
Since Seo Dong Gun's sentence was 15 years, he doesn't have much time left before his release.
What release?
He died while he was in prison.
He died in prison?
After their father died, the mother took her son and immigrated to U.S.
Oh, I don't know why I'm running around like this.
What do you think Lawyer Seo?
Am I being too suspicious?
I feel so anxious and I can't tell what's what.
Why do I want to keep digging?
Should I just quit?
You'll just tell me to dig wide and deep, right?
Oh, that scared me!
Yes, Dad.
You're in front of my house?
I heard from your mother that I'm totally using my daughter.
What?
Am I someone who would use his daughter for his own personal gain?
I'm doing this because it won't hurt you either.
It's not about hurting you.
Good family background, strong personal abilities, family assets and even money,
I picked someone specially who has all of that.
What's with all the dissatisfaction?
Did you get mad at Mom?
So you're the same as your mom?
That's not what I mean.
If I do it my way, you'll benefit as well.
That's what I'm pushing for this.
You came here to tell me this?
Even if you don't like it, even though it's my way of doing things,
it's because your father loves you.
Children... to love them, or not to love them, as parents there's no choice.
You just end up loving the child, no matter what.
That's why parents suffer.
And I hate the suffering more than anything, too.
So unfair.
Dad, you don't do anything bad, right?
Of course I do, why wouldn't I?
You said you didn't last time.
Doing something bad is defined differently by each person.
Especially to a man.
Dad, by chance...
I need to go.
Go out and get some dinner.
Yes.
Lawyer Seo.
Come out and have dinner with me.
I told you to stop doing this.
It's annoying.
I'm hungry.
I'm having a very, very difficult time.
And when I'm hungry, it's even more difficult.
Can you help me eat dinner?
It's like honey!
It's really good; hurry up and eat.
Why didn't I ever see it when I passed by?
It's really good.
It's hot.
Mmm, it's good.
How much meat is there here?
Why aren't you eating?
Excuse me!
Oh, this is strange.
My tolerance is usually very high.
Why is my body so tired after drinking these?
- Let's go.
- No, no, no!
Cancel!
Cancel!
I'm not tired!
- Let's go.
- Can't we just stay here?
We're finished eating.
Like in the past, stay...
Why can't you?
I'm having such a difficult time.
While you were gone,
I was so scared and so many scary things happened.
If you were going to be this way, why did you record your voice for my clock?
Why did you cook for me?
Why... did you appear?
Why?
Just stop it Hye Ri.
Don't continue.
Hello?
Hello?
May I bother you?
You can bother me.
Is this Go Man Chul's residence?
So?
Who's this?
This is the bank.
Go Man Chul has registered for an event, but his cell phone has changed.
Hey!
You're Han Jung Ran, right?
Hey!
Hey!
You're one voice I'll never forget.
Why those two... are they still meeting?
Those adulterers are still fighting against the institution of monogamy, aren't they?
They haven't broken up after 15 years?
How can she recognize my voice?
That housewife isn't someone to be trifled with.
I shouldn't have called the house.
You don't know where he works, don't have his cell phone number, of course you have to call his house.
Oh, how can I get in contact with Go Man Chul?
But, why are you throwing a fit because you can't reach him?
It's not because I like him.
There's something I need to ask him.
Go Man Chul, are you inside?
Go Man Chul!
Go Man Chul, are you inside?
Open the door please...
This is a different girl.
This time it's a wet behind the ears young...
Oh...
I'm here to investigate...
I'm Prosecutor Ma Hye Ri.
- Prosecutor?
- Yes.
This is Go Man Chul's residence, right?
I'm here because I have something to ask him.
Wait, wait.
Just come inside the house.
You want me to find Han Jung Ran?
That girl... 15 years ago, no is it 16 years?
Regardless, she is someone who had an affair with my husband.
I had no idea that they were still meeting.
I can't find someone for that reason.
That woman is a home-wrecker, Prosecutor!
So, does Go Man Chul have a cell phone?
He lost it while running away.
You think I'd buy him one?
You don't know where he is?
That other time, I should have had them locked away for the crime of adultery.
I was afraid of losing a pile of money.
So there's no way to get in contact with Go Man Chul?
So Prosecutor, if I want to put away someone for adultery, how do I do that?
You need to have proof of your husband's relationship with Han Jung Ran.
Proof?
Proof?
Proof.
A minute ago, you said something about 15 years ago.
By chance...
A while ago, you also mentioned something about a pile of money.
What did you mean?
I'll contact you.
So... that... that...
You can't hurry up?
The Rose...
Where is Han Jang Ran's business?
Wait!
Wait!
Wait!
Wait!
Wait!
Why did the prosecutor come here?
What did she ask you?
What did you tell her?
Why would I live with someone like you?
!
Why?
!
Why?
!
Why?
!
Why?
!
Why?
!
Honey, Honey, don't be like this.
Why did she come?
Tell me what you guys talked about.
You and Han Jung Ran have been meeting for 15 years.
- She came to give me a divorce!
A divorce!
- Wait!
Wait!
Was that for real?
What kind of prosecutor says those things?
What did you just say?
My Hye Ri is doing what?
Ma Sang Tae's daughter, Prosecutor Ma Hye Ri, is asking about the incident 15 years ago.
How?
Why?
Why?
Why are you asking me?
She's looking for Jung Ran, and coming to see my wife asking,
"How did you receive this property?"
"What are you keeping quiet about?"
She's asking things like that.
So what did she say?
Aigoo, Hyungnim, you sure live a complicated life.
What?
Why did you make your daughter a prosecutor?
Why you little...!
Even when it seems the sky is dark, the sun always comes out.
Shut up!
I better shut up.
I kept my mouth shut like this for 15 years.
I shut my mouth and you kept my mouth shut.
Didn't you?
Why is Hye Ri asking about that case?
How did she find out?
Hello?
Prosecutor!
It's Go Man Chul's wife.
Go Man Chul's wife...?
Ah!
Yes, yes.
How can I help you?
Can we still use this to charge them with adultery?
You came all this way for this?
You told me if there was anything from 15 years ago between Go Man Chul and Han Jung Ran to call you.
I did tell you, but, this is...
We can't charge them with adultery?
We can't charge them with adultery with these kinds of pictures.
But back then, I said I was going to use these for adultery charges, so he gave me a wad of money and begged.
Here!
The two of them going into a motel, then coming out; it's captured in a picture.
Going in was 9:55.
Coming out was 10:32.
During that time, Go Man Chul and Han Jung Ran were in a motel.
But then, Dad...
Between 9 and 12,
I was out drinking with Go Man Chul.
I called in the afternoon and said let's meet up.
At a bar called The Rose.
It was supposed to be closed that day, but since Man Chul oppa is a regular,
I opened the store for him.
The two of them going into a motel then coming out, it's captured in a picture.
Yoo Myung Woo's death was between 10 and 10:30.
During that time, Dad said he was drinking with Go Man Chul.
But Go Man Chul was with Han Jung Ran at a motel.
Dad's alibi is not true.
Dad gave Go Man Chul property for being his alibi.
No way, impossible.
Impossible.
- I'm going.
- Okay.
Lawyer Seo.
Why is Lawyer Seo coming out of there?
After selling store, I feel so good.
Excuse me.
Aigoo!
Prosecutor!
Hello!
Gong Soon Hee, right?
We meet again here.
Jung Ran is my friend.
Oh, I see.
How do you know her?
After I got your request, the illegal gambling.
She's the Prosecutor I helped.
So that investigation was you?
So then, Lawyer Seo, you know him as well?
Lawyer... what do you mean "lawyer"?
The man who just left a few minutes ago.
Ah, Writer Seo.
Writer?
He's not a lawyer?
He's not a lawyer, but a writer.
But because of the legwork, he lied and said he was a lawyer to meet you.
Right, Jung Ran?
He should be telling you directly.
There's no books published with his name, but he's writing a detective novel.
But Prosecutor, why do you keep coming here?
I really don't like it.
Lawyer Seo...
No...
I mean the person named Seo In Woo, how did you get to know him?
As a customer and he came like a little brother and worries about my well being.
Since when?
About 2 years.
He's a customer that comes once a week to buy flowers.
I didn't know he was a lawyer.
Shin Jung Nam, witness.
Han Jung Ran.
Go Man Chul,
Dad's alibi.
The man who died in prison, Seo Dong Gun.
The son who went to America.
The lawyer who returned from America.
I went to America when I was in 6th grade.
After 4 months in America, Mother died in a car accident.
I lived with my father.
Whatever my father said was all a promise.
It "was" a promise?
Why is it past tense?
He doesn't keep promises now?
I couldn't keep the promises.
I couldn't keep them.
Still...
Seo In Woo.

Episode 4
Goodbye, goodbye, my princess.
I'll let you go.
Stretch your wings and fly as high as the sky.
Goodbye, goodbye, my princess.
Are you all right?
You aren't hurt?
Answer me you dumbbell!
Sunbaenim!
(Addressing older colleague)
Do you think you can walk?
But why are you here?
What happened to the police?
They're coming.
I really thought I was going to die.
What's this?
What's going on?
What the heck are you doing?
Hold on.
My shoes.
Hold on.
Shoes!
We're saved.
I'll get down now.
What's this?
Blood, blood.
Sunbaenim!
You must have gotten cut before!
The knife!
Oh no!
Are you alright?
I'm fine.
Goodness.
It's bleeding.
The hospital.
Cell phone.
Cell phone.
Hurry!
Stop being so fussy.
But you've been stabbed.
Who's the one that got me stabbed.
Are you in your right mind?
You come to a criminal den without any back-up?
You're not even scared?
If I reported it, would they have let me do it?
If you knew you couldn't do it after reporting it, why did you do it?
What if something bad had happened?
You said you weren't a loser.
That you were going to show me your ability.
Was this it?
Why can't you think?
How can you do something like this?
!
Because I wanted to live!
I have a brain.
Don't you think I have thoughts of my own?
Do you think I followed gamblers and pretended to gamble because I was bored?
Do you think I wasn't scared coming to a place like this by myself?
There's a reason why I had to resort to this.
And I wanted to show you also.
Either way, we succeeded.
How did you find out about this place?
Where did you learn about the gambling operation?
Um... that's...
But you can't say that I told you about the gambling operation.
Do I look stupid?
If a prosecutor receives help from a lawyer, it could be misconstrued or investigated as an illegal solicitation.
You know everything.
I really do know everything.
It's just that I don't always think the same as everyone else.
But I really do know everything I should.
It's that...
Why aren't you telling me?
Let me take this out first.
Can you put your hand in there?
Wh...
Where do you want me to put my hands?
I have a recorder taped to my back.
You really are a dumbbell.
Alright...
I'll take it off.
You were acting like that before so that you wouldn't lose this?
Of course.
It's evidence.
I recorded the gambling inside the building and the henchmen also.
It's broken.
I thought there was going to be a huge crowd to capture.
What's this?
Prosecutor, are you playing with me?
They really all ran away?
We caught two peons but what are we going to do with just two?
They took all the money and there isn't any evidence of gambling at all.
Is there no way to get the tape to work?
It's too broken so it won't work.
It doesn't work for me either...
What am I going to do?
I know all of their faces.
I can help with a composite.
I remember all of their names.
Midge larvae.
Evil Rocket.
The Brain.
How are those names?
They're just nicknames.
Then... the investigation was a failure?
My nails are broken and scratched up.
And I have all these scrapes and bruises.
It was really difficult... (The background noise is pretty hard to hear.
I think we can leave this out all together but here's a few lines.)
Hurry up!
Why are you pushing me?
Get in!
Let's go to the hospital first.
I'll take care of it.
Go home first.
You got stabbed because of me.
How can I go home first?
Are you going to be okay looking like that?
Your parents will worry when they see you.
That's why I have to go home like this.
What's going to happen to me?
You'll have to see at work tomorrow.
I'll get reported through the police station.
Right?
I'm sure they won't keep it quiet.
I won't get fired.
Right?
When a person does something like this, they usually resign on their own.
You're telling me to resign?
Even if it doesn't come to a resignation, you should be prepared for a suspension.
I can't get suspended either.
The plan and preparation were really perfect.
I learned and practiced how to gamble for so long.
And even did field practice multiple times.
Aigoo, what am I going to do...
I'm in such big trouble...
You went out saying you were working on a big case.
Did you roll around on a gambling table?
What happened?
Daddy,
I almost died today.
So, did you succeed?
I almost... but it didn't work out.
You didn't die.
And you're not hurt?
Go upstairs.
Just a little more.
Just a little...
Really...
Your skin used to shine like porcelain from the Joseon era.
Now look at it!
Mom.
My nails... make everything the same as the broken ones.
Were you digging the ground with your bare hands?
I worked this hard.
Even if I get fired, Dad will let things go.
Right?
You won't be able to get away with anything until you get married.
You really have to meet a man who doesn't change after marriage.
Not all men are the same.
He was so handsome.
Who?
Nothing's been working out for you these days.
Look at this.
I was too careless.
I didn't calculate the right number of henchmen.
I don't think Ma Hye Ri is meant to be.
If she gets suspended for a few months, it's game over.
I really think she had potential.
Only if things worked out today.
I should have been more prudent.
I should have paid more attention to the danger that she was in.
She really could have gotten hurt.
MOM!
What?
You saw.
How can he do this?
Isn't this mine?
Even if it was his money, it's my clothes and shoes!
He said to report him.
Then what am I suppose to wear to work today?
He said you weren't naked yesterday.
That the dresses in this closet aren't the only clothes.
He's saying don't even think about using my injury as an excuse.
He's really great at putting his thoughts into action.
He'll open it up tonight.
Mom.
Why did you marry a man like Dad?
But he did tell Driver Lee to take you to work.
It's enough that I get a free ride?
Hye Ri.
I'm really sorry that your mom can't do anything.
But what happens to me depends on you also.
Stick it out no matter what.
Okay?
Didn't you see how many police officers went to catch two peons?
Ma Hye Ri deceived them into sending out so many officers.
She didn't do it on purpose.
When she called for the officers, she had evidence as well.
Prosecutor Ma had some bad luck.
She already deceived us by investigating the case without reporting it.
I've done investigations without reporting them also.
But you were accompanied by a detective!
Wait, this sounds weird.
Are you taking Ma Hye Ri's side right now?
I feel somewhat responsible as her mentor.
Yoon Se Jun, what do you want to say to me?
Why is it taking so long?
Yoon sunbae doesn't even talk a lot.
Chief should be speaking with the Deputy Director about going to the committee.
I'm sure he's listening to the situation.
How could she have created such a big mess?
If she attempted an undercover investigation alone, don't you think she has some reason for it?
What reason?
She just thinks she's smart enough to handle anything.
If she fails the internal hearing, she really won't have anyone to turn to.
But I'm starting to like Ma Hye Ri.
She's refreshing, more than any of us.
Prosecutor Lee, there's nothing refreshing.
How is this refreshing?
They're investigating inappropriate actions.
Whether she gets fired, gets a pay cut, or suspended, she's just going to keep doing whatever she wants.
What the heck is refreshing about that?
Hello.
I'm sorry for being late.
My joints were hurting so it took longer than I expected.
You can feel painful joints in luxury cars also?
After the incident with the minors at the club, my father took away the car.
And yesterday, he took away all my clothes and shoes.
What's she talking about?
If you liked using physical strength so much, why did you become a prosecutor?
No, not at all.
I really really dislike using my physical strength.
I did the investigation because I wanted to be a prosecutor.
I'm really sorry.
You should have at least reported it!
You go out somewhere so dangerous without reporting it or getting a warrant?
And you get your sunbae involved?
Yoon sunbae got hurt because he was trying to save me...
Sunbaenim, what did they say at the hospital?
You're hurt?
What a dumbbell.
It's just a little scratch.
Of course.
Yoon Se Jun worked as the prosecutor in the Department of Violent Crimes.
What?
But... it's not that.
He was stabbed.
You got stabbed?
No, it's just a minor scratch.
Why didn't you say anything?
Did you not say anything so that Ma Hye Ri wouldn't get fired?
Yes.
Get out.
Get out.
Both of you out.
I don't want to see either of you.
Out!
Sunbaenim.
Your arm...
How's your arm?
Stop fluttering around and go wait.
Prosecutor.
What happened with the case who went into hiding in Incheon?
Kim Dong Seok or something, did you catch him?
No, he wasn't caught.
That's too bad.
After you left your prosecutor behind to go catch him.
If you had fully informed me of the situation,
I wouldn't have done that.
I had definitely asked for your help.
That was definite?
It was a maybe at best.
It's a good thing that Prosecutor Yoon was able to go in my stead.
I heard it was dangerous.
But... has Prosecutor Yoon always been such a good fighter?
I heard he personally worked the field when he was in the Department of Violent Crimes.
I see.
I know it's wrong.
But the accident was caused because she wanted to work hard and try something.
Deputy Director, if you suspend her now, we'll be cutting off any desire she has to live.
What am I talking about?
Please give her one more chance.
Really?
I'm not sure if she's lucky or you're lucky.
Do well.
That Ma Hye Ri's pretty clever.
Really Chief?
I just have to write up a case report?
It's because Prosecutor Yoon put in a request on your behalf.
Yoon sunbaenim?
If you don't handle this case right, Prosecutor Yoon will be responsible.
So do it well.
Th...is case?
Prosecutor Yoon basically signed a guarantee for you.
You know what a guarantee is, right?
Paying someone's debt if they can't pay it themselves.
How can a prosecutor do that?
It's not like a case is money.
If I can't solve the case, how will Prosecutor Yoon pay it back?
He'll get demoted to Dok Island or something.
A prosecutor's office is opening in Dok Island?
That's right.
The Japanese keep saying that the island is theirs, so we're taking a stand.
You want to go there too?
Sunbaenim.
Come with me.
Sit down.
Sunbaenim.
I heard you saved me.
I just thought you should get at least one real chance.
Case, case.
I don't know why you're putting your life on a case.
But try it.
It's a case.
It's a child sexual assault case.
Whatever the reason you're doing this, investigate the case with prudence.
Thank you.
I'll do a good job with this case.
Don't just say it.
Really, I will.
I'll make sure you don't get sent to Dok Island.
Please believe me.
Dok Island?
How's your arm?
What did they say at the hospital?
Let me see.
See what?
It's fine.
But let me just see it.
What are you doing?
- Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
- How can you just ignore your arm when you've hurt it?
Prosecutor Jin.
Sunbae, you're hurt?
It's nothing.
You came at the right time.
Prosecutor Ma, Prosecutor Jin has a lot of experience with child sexual assault cases.
So ask her if you have any questions.
Yes.
Prosecutor Ma, you have a visitor.
A visitor?
He just said he's from the Lawyer Seo.
Oh.
I'll see you later.
Is that why you asked me to drive in the morning?
What's your injury?
It's just a few stitches.
You get injured because of Prosecutor Ma.
And you keep her from being suspended and even got her a case.
Why are you doing all this for her?
It's not like that.
Wow...
Why are you looking so tattered?
Was this your real height?
You're a shorty.
I'm 168cm.
Lawyer Seo, you're not looking too good either.
Did you get beat up?
Were you in a fight?
When did you get into a fight?
Your face is a mess but your wits are fine.
You look like you're in a good mood.
I was saved.
I've escaped from danger.
No life behind bars.
Stay of execution.
Stay of execution?
They let it go?
Not only that, but they gave me a case.
How did that happen?
Prosecutor Yoon...
Can I tell you tomorrow?
I'm really busy today because of the case.
I'll be really busy tomorrow because of a case also.
The bag you told me to hold yesterday.
And some other stuff.
My clothes and shoes.
Why didn't I remember this?
What's this?
Th..this... my shoes!
You came yesterday?
I said I'd watch from nearby.
But the location changed last minute...
You knew about the new location?
If I had known, I wouldn't have come too late.
If you came, why didn't you say anything?
It was already too late.
And it wasn't a situation where I could reveal myself.
It was already a bust and what if the lawyer connection had been revealed.
That would have been a headache.
Oh, I see!
How did you find this?
By accident?
Did you get into a fight there?
I figured you'd need a cell phone right away.
You can change the name on the phone whenever you want.
Hold on.
Why are you being cheesy?
I'm cheesy?
Or is it because of what you want to say?
Confessions of love during the middle of the day are really cheesy.
Oh my God!
Love... for you?
It's most definitely nothing like that.
Then what did you want to confess?
It's not a confession but... stop doing that... liking me.
Why should I?
Because there's someone else I like.
So stop it.
No matter how much you like me.
You don't have a chance.
Who is it?
You don't need to know that.
Prosecutor Jin.
If I say no, can you just accept it?
I'm just worried about you.
I had a hard time looking at someone who looked so much like her, so I let her become independent.
It's because of that guilt and regret.
Only that.
Why does it matter if people look alike when their personality, interests, and mannerisms are completely different.
And honestly, Song Won Ji was much prettier.
It's not my style to spend time with other men when I have someone I like.
So let's not see each other anymore.
I can't do that.
Did Prosecutor Yoon Se Jun say that he likes you too?
Are you guys dating?
How did you know?
I have a gift.
You didn't know?
What...
How...
How did you know that I liked Yoon sunbae?
I haven't told anyone.
You guys aren't even dating yet.
Why are you getting ahead of yourself and breaking off with the men around you?
It's so old fashioned.
Our relationship's already all muddled anyways.
We can just see each other when the need arises.
But still... that's not right.
Goodness.
Don't you think you're being too shameless saying we won't meet again when you still haven't paid me my fees?
Oh... the police station.
Of course you forgot.
You must have swindling tendencies in your subconscious.
What?
I won't say that you're responsible for my future, so let's just stay as is.
Stop giving everything up.
Either way, I've given you fair warning.
Don't come too close.
I won't take responsibility even if you get hurt.
Oh yeah.
I've been using it...
Where is it?
Tada.
What is it?
Good luck with the bruise.
Call me if you need a lawyer.
Yoon Se Jun.
You're a better man than me.
Why is he trying to make me feel sorry?
Sunbaenim.
Sunbaenim!
I reviewed the files and have a few...
Ask Prosecutor Jin.
The victim is seven.
The suspect is a 48 year old director of a music academy.
It's an attempted criminal assault but there's no evidence.
The mom found out eight days later.
If it's attempted criminal assault, it's hard to gather evidence when so many days have elapsed.
Since we wouldn't want to unnecessarily hurt the child,
I should speak to the suspect first.
Right?
You'll need to get a child expert.
A child expert?
When you're investigating a child assault case, it's procedure to have a child expert.
The expert can determine the child's characteristics and develop a trusting relationship.
Hello.
Hello.
He was a well known teacher, so Ji Min's mom took her every Wednesday for lessons.
But that day...
This is Ji Min's mom.
I'm really sorry about this.
She received a call about plumbing problems at her store and was late in picking up Ji Min after going to the store during the lesson.
Ji Min.
Yes?
Mom's going to be a little late.
Yes.
You like puzzles.
Then this will go here.
Not there, but here.
Ji Min, you're really good at this.
Ji Min, let's go do something else fun.
Okay?
Ji Min, you'll have fun.
How could she just sleep here?
Ji Min.
Ji Min.
You're here.
Director, I'm so sorry.
Don't worry.
She played well by herself.
She was sleeping so soundly that I brought her home in a cab.
I had no idea.
Next week, she said she didn't want to go to the lesson because she was sick.
I asked her where it hurt.
And she said she had a headache.
I didn't think much of it.
But when I was giving her a bath the next day, she tried to hold back as long as possible and then started crying.
You didn't bathe her for a week?
She kept resisting bathing during the week.
Even if... do you usually not bathe her if she doesn't want to?
Yes.
When I'm tired from work, there are days when I don't.
Oh.
I see.
Look.
Look here.
Prosecutor-in-charge.
It says Ma Hye Ri.
Right?
It's there!
Ma Hye Ri!
My ear hurts!
Please give me the key to the closet.
Are you a prosecutor now that you have a case?
There needs to be a hearing for you to be a real prosecutor.
I received the case because my prosecutor mentor vouched for me.
It has to go into litigation or he'll get demoted.
He'll get demoted.
Demotion?
Here.
How about the car keys?
Having the car key and the credit cards are prohibited until there is a hearing on that case.
Omo, omo.
How do you know things like that?
Do you think anyone can be a prosecutor's dad?
Oh my precious.
You pretty thing.
Were you okay?
I've missed you.
Oh my pinky.
It must have been hard on you.
How can I give up on you?
How can I live without you?
I need to take care of you.
And take care of Yoon sunbae.
Not just a prosecutor.
Even if I have to be a prosecutor's grandmother, I'll do it.
That's right.
I'll do it.
I came about Yoo Ji Min.
Prosecutor, Kim Yoon Shik is here.
Hello, I'm Kim Yoon Shik.
Yes.
I graduated Ulysses Conservatory and was teaching in North Carolina.
But my wife really missed her homeland, so I returned because of her.
I'm already aware of your situation, so please just answer my question.
You've never touched Ji Min?
I've patted her behind for doing well.
Multiple times.
Why did you take her into your office?
The office is sound proof.
Right?
She said she was bored while waiting for her mom.
It was to work on a puzzle.
When the 5 o'clock student came 20 minutes early, why did you tell them to wait?
Because they were early.
It wasn't just to keep Ji Min quiet.
So that she wouldn't tell anyone?
Prosecutor, don't do this without any proof.
Ji Min pointed you out during the police investigation.
Let me see her in person.
I'd like to see if she could do that while looking straight at me.
Are you saying that a seven year old lied?
Ji Min's mom is someone who needs money.
Are you saying that she's making her daughter lie for money?
I was being an stand-up person.
I even gave her a 30% discount.
Really?
She really wanted me to teach her but couldn't afford the lesson fees.
She said she was raising Ji Min by herself after her divorce.
I'm not that type of person.
Sunbaenim.
Sunbaenim.
He's all up in arms saying that he never did such a thing.
He says that he'll file a complaint against Ji Min's mom.
We can't do anything else if he denies the claim so vehemently.
We'll need have the child give her testimony.
Don't forget to get a child expert.
But this suspect... not just sex crimes, but he doesn't have anything on his record.
And his wife is pretty.
Really?
He goes to church and volunteers every week.
What are you trying to say?
He doesn't seem like someone who'd do that to a child.
That's possibly not true.
There's a possibility that it's not true?
All suspects deny the accusation at first.
You didn't learn that?
I... did.
I guess.
I'm sure that a child wouldn't tell a dreadful lie.
Right?
But there's not a single shred of evidence coming from the child.
Just because a child said it, it doesn't mean it's true.
Since the mom is there.
A child can lie because a mom asked her to?
Yes, it could be a lie or the truth.
If you say it like that, how is that helpful?
It's your job to find that out.
Why are you asking me?
You'll need to find the truth that's hidden in the situation.
You'll need to keep searching.
If the mom's not there, it'll be easy to figure out if the child is lying.
I'll look forward to seeing you handle it.
Hello.
-Hi!
-Hello.
Ji Min.
My name is Ma Hye Ri.
Omo.
Ji Min.
You look just like your mom!
Ji Min.
We're going to play with dolls right now.
Let's have fun.
Look at this doll.
This doll is the violin director.
And this is Ji Min.
So you were with the violin director that day.
Right?
So...
I'll ask you one more time.
What did this ahjusshi doll do to you?
Where did he touch you?
It looks like Ji Min doesn't want to play with dolls right now.
Really?
Then should we play with a puzzle?
Um... puzz...
Mom, let's go home.
Ji Min.
Nice girls answer when an adult asks them a question.
Why won't you answer?
Ji Min, you can talk.
Why won't you talk?
Mom, let's go home.
Okay.
Mother, I'm sorry.
But can you go outside for a minute?
Prosecutor...
Mom, let's go home.
I want to go home.
What's wrong with her?
Goodbye.
What am I going to do?
Kids are perceptive.
What?
Pretending to be nice, pretty, or close;
they know it all.
What does that...
You need to understand the child's feelings first.
A seven year old.
I've never even seen a seven year old except when I was seven.
How am I suppose to know what a seven year old likes?
I don't even remember what I liked back then.
Except that I liked to eat.
Isn't it good enough that I was nice?
What else can I do?
Investigator Cha, not an eight year old nor a six year old, do you know a seven year old?
A friend's daughter, a niece, or someone else in the family?
Anyone like that?
Prosecutor Yoon's daughter is seven.
What?
What did you say?
Who's daughter?
Prosecutor Yoon Se Jun's daughter.
Prosecutor Yoon is married?
He is.
Should I be saying he was?
Then... he's divorced?
I believe she passed away.
Passed... away.
He's a widower?
You didn't know that?
Here's some more.
Is that all?
Yes.
Once you finish this, there are no arbitration cases left.
You just need to write up a conclusion for that case.
You're reviewing it again?
When you were out at a legal conference earlier, Prosecutor Ma handled the case.
Call Ms. Lee Bomi and ask her to come into the office tomorrow.
Yes.
Isn't it completely ridiculous?
You're more ridiculous.
How can you not know whether he's married or not?
How can no one say anything to me until now?
Why would someone tell you something like that?
The interested party is the one who should be asking.
But there wasn't even a hint that he was married.
He's a widower.
Of course there wouldn't be any signs.
You really have no interest in anyone else.
No one else has an interest in me either.
I thought you were doing well with that lawyer.
When I saw him at the police station, he was totally a tall glass of water.
How old is he?
Where did he go to school?
Wow.
This is pretty.
You haven't gotten your credit cards back yet.
Let's use yours for now.
Did Ji Min's mom tell her to lie?
That can't be.
[Kindhearted Mr. In Woo]
What is it?
Since you're in charge of a difficult case, I wanted to see if you need help.
Do you need help?
If not, it's fine.
Um...
I do.
If you don't have any evidence and can't get testimony from the child, you can't get a hearing.
That's why my head's about to burst.
You'll need to get closer to the child.
Pretending to be close is different from actually being close.
I have no idea how to get close.
Why don't you try meeting Prosecutor Yoon Se Jun's daughter?
Don't you want to look good in front of him anyway?
You knew Yoon sunbae had been married?
Why didn't you tell me?
I thought you already knew.
You didn't know?
No, I didn't know.
If someone doesn't tell me first, I don't usually ask.
Why do you seem angry?
You're in shock.
He's been married already.
And he's got a kid to boot.
So?
What do you mean so?
It's over?
Of course.
Does it make sense that I'm with a widower?
Why should I like someone who has a seven year old daughter?
I heard that love is filled with "why's".
He's not someone who I should fall in love with.
There's no one you can't fall in love with.
I guess there are people you can't love.
My dad would pulverize me.
Yes, I took the photos at a hospital the day Na Yumi hit me.
You said Ms. Na Yumi hit you with her right hand.
Of course.
Since I was hit on the left side.
Looking at the hand mark, it must have hurt a lot.
You don't have to tell me.
That woman's physique is like a bear.
Can you show me where the thumb print would be?
It looks like it should be here.
It didn't come out very well.
Since this is the pinky.
This is the pinky?
Yes.
It's this.
It's the same direction as your left hand.
I guess so.
Then Ms. Na Yumi didn't hit you with her right hand.
What?
If I use my right hand to hit your left cheek, my thumb would be next to your nose.
Ms. Lee Bomi, you hit your face with your own hand, right?
No I didn't.
Investigator Lee, take a print of Ms. Lee Bomi's hand and send it to the police station.
Yes.
Pros...
Prosecutor.
Just this once...
[On call until 11PM]
Post it today since she's on call.
And call me.
I need to receive a warrant today.
Who's the prosecutor on call?
Prosecutor Ma Hye Ri.
I've been waiting two days for this.
Come one, come all.
I'll approve anything.
That Prosecutor Ma?
Bingo!
I should get what I need also.
[Re:
Arrest Warrant-The individual named hereafter] is accused of assault and battery...]
[Suspect:
Shin Dong Ha (Occupation: unemployed)] [DOB: 6/16/83...]
More?
Attorney.
How did you know to come here?
Someone from the lawyer's office where my son works told me.
Since you got him an introduction there.
What brings you by?
An arrest warrant for my Dong Ha has been sent to the prosecutor's office.
Why?
What happened to your son?
Prosecutor Ma, you're really popular.
I guess so.
Do cases have eyes also?
Why are there so many cases?
If I had known, I could have just waited until I was on call.
Why didn't you tell me?
This never happens.
I don't need any more cases until this is finished.
[Suspect:
Shin Dong Ha]
I was on call today.
It looks like you at least act like a prosecutor.
Of course.
I'm a prosecutor also.
What are you doing on the weekend?
I'm playing with my daughter.
I see.
Hey Grace...
I met him the first time because of you.
And I was wearing you when he rescued me.
He must be my destiny.
Mom!
Please don't leave.
My kindhearted self, my tenderhearted self, how could it be?
A melody that won't answer me.
Even though my heart is bruised and my eyes are teary, my steps always lead me back to you.
I love you.
Tada!
I'm so so happy!
It smells delicious.
We used to do this about once a week.
Right?
This is how we used to live.
Right?
More like two or three times a week.
This is true living.
I blame the heavens.
Why don't you keep doing it?
Why do you need to watch what you eat at your age?
And you're already married.
Give up.
Just give up.
Do you think I can so easily let go?
Just like this.
Just hit it exactly like this.
- Okay?
- Yes.
Wasn't it good?
Yes, yes, it was good.
You're really good.
One, two, three, four, five.
Again.
You should be able to do at least ten.
Ahjumma, Dad must like tormenting me whenever Sunday comes around.
He's not tormenting you.
It's because you really don't like to exercise.
That's what I'm saying.
What's this?
The two of you are ganging up against me?
Bin, you didn't know?
I've always been on your dad's side.
Ahjumma, you didn't know?
I don't like to exercise, just like my mom.
Mom didn't like to exercise?
Jumping rope, running, biking, even boxing...
There wasn't anything she couldn't do.
I miss Mom.
Hello?
Hello.
Yes, Prosecutor Ma.
What?
Where?
I'm in front of your house right now.
Are you home?
Dad, what?
I saw your car here in front.
Can I come in for a minute?
Hold on.
I'll call you in a minute.
Prosecutor Jin.
Stay here with Bin.
Bin, wait here until I come back.
Hello.
So handsome...
What's with you?
Are you really a dummy?
What?
Why are you at someone's house without a call or an appointment?
It's that...
Go home and don't come back, not even to the neighborhood.
I didn't know you'd dislike it and I don't know any children.
What?
And I heard that your daughter was seven and Ji Min is seven.
I wanted to find out what a seven year old girl liked... and what I'm saying is just an excuse.
I was just using that excuse because I wanted to see you.
I was curious.
I wanted to see where you lived.
Isn't it possible for one person to like another person?
What?
Yes.
I like you, Sunbaenim.
I like you.
I can't do that?
How can you?
I can't like you?
No.
Why not?
Focus on work.
Just because you've been given a second chance, you shouldn't let yourself be distracted.
And I don't think much of you.
Not much at all.
I really hate it when a person, who harms others, says she likes me.
Go home.
Dad!
Look Ahjumma.
I told you he was going to the bathroom.
Dad, what's this?
This is mine.
Right?
Who brought this?
Don't touch it.
It's probably not yours.
Yoon Bin.
It's me.
Welcome.
Hello.
Hello.
What's all this?
I wasn't sure what Ji Min would like, so I just bought a few things.
You bought all this?
When is Ji Min coming?
These presents are too excessive.
Not at all.
It looks like the store must be doing well.
The lesson fees seemed pretty expensive.
I earn enough for lesson fees.
Why didn't you say that Director Kim discounted the fees by 30%?
I think you'll need to give up the Yoo Ji Min case.
What?
What do you mean?
I received a request to change prosecutors from Ji Min's mother.
What?
Why?
She says that she doesn't have confidence in you.
Why?
Why doesn't she feel confident with me?
Your clothes and she must have heard about the booking incident.
But more than that she doesn't think you believe the victim.
Chief!
Wait, I'll go with you.
Prosecutor Ma Hye Ri.
Hello.
You must still like tomatoes;
you're still thin.
What brings you here?
I came to bring you a present now that my false accusation has been revealed.
What?
Enjoy your tomatoes!
I told you I didn't do it.
That I didn't hit her.
I begged you to hear me out but you wouldn't even listen to me.
All you could do was eat your tomatoes!
Please have some.
Ignoring someone who was victimized.
How are you a prosecutor?
!
Let's go.
Who's that?
It that Ma Hye Ri's boyfriend?
Wipe it off.
Why don't you just cry?
You can shower or take a bath.
Whatever you want, everything you need should be there.
I'll leave clothes for you by the door.
You should gain some weight.
Can I get a garbage bag?
I'll get you everything you need, so sit down first.
A hot cup of cocoa that will soothe your heart.
Oh, Yoo Na.
I did wear your clothes today.
Why?
Internet?
Why are you telling me to look at the internet?
I begged you to hear me out but you wouldn't even listen to me.
All you could do was eat your tomatoes!
Ignoring someone who was victimized.
How are you a prosecutor?
!
People are too much.
[Omo!
I knew it...] [It's the Booking Prosecutor again...]
[The Booking Prosecutor gets what she deserves.]
I hate them!
Hye Ri!
Why is everyone doing this to me?
!
Why me?
!
Only me!
I hate it!
I don't want to see arayof sunshinefromexpectingadrink.
I don't want to see tears falling from the effects of alcohol.
Don't cry.
Don't cry.
I don't want to make you cry.
I don't want to see a ray of sunshine from expecting a drink.
I don't want to see tears falling from the effects of alcohol.
Don't cry.
Don't cry.
That's right, it's for your benefit.
I will do it if that's the only way.
Goodbye, goodbye my princess.
I'll let you go.
Stretch your wings and fly as high as the sky.
Goodbye, goodbye my princess.
But please remember me, who has been there for you.
Goodbye...
Mom, I'm sorry.
I can't be a prosecutor anymore.
Whenever I try my hardest, something bad happens.
I can't handle it anymore.
I can't put up with it anymore.
Mom, you take care of things there.
I can hide for about three months.
So tell Dad that you don't know where I am.
No, that I went somewhere to die.
I want to go anywhere that I don't need a visa.
Wherever is the next flight out.
Hold on a minute.
Where are you going?
South side!
Ma Hye Ri, you can't go... anywhere.

Chief!
That home delivery.
What do you mean investigate Ma Hye Ri?
Sunbaenim.
Sunbaenim.
Do you really not have any interest in me?
A pretty, slender, young woman says she likes you.
Why do you have to hide your feelings?
[Prosecutor's Office] [New Prosecutor Appointment Ceremony]
Great Korean people, to your great nation, long may you be true.
Please be seated.
I will now introduce the the esteemed members of the judiciary who have graced this event with their participation to present the Certificates of Appointment.
Jeong Seong Jin, Head of the Judiciary Training Institute
Choi Chae Won, Deputy Prosecutor from the Supreme Prosecutor's office.
Lee Doo Shik, Chief Prosecutor from Seoul Prosecutor's office Northern Division.
Kim Sang Jil, Deputy Prosecutor from the Supreme Prosecutor's office.
Prosecutor Hwang Il Su.
Certificate of Appointment, Seoul Prosecutor's Office, Criminal Justice Division 1.
Prosecutor Ma Hye Ri.
Fly high, so fly high, so fly high!
Go to the sky!
So fly high, so fly high, so fly high!
Go to the sky!
Now it's time to fly!
The heart, burn up.
Engines, turn up
The dreams hidden in the heart will unfold.
Believe only me
I'll hold your hand.
I can make your dream come true.
Fly high.
Your mother collapsed?
Yes.
They say she's gone into the operating room.
So you see, I can't possibly... going to the workshop would be hard.
Ah, of course.
That would be the case.
Your name is...
Ma Hye Ri.
Prosecutor Ma Hye Ri.
Aigoo, on such a happy day as this...
I have to hurry to the hospital.
I'll be going now.
Give me, give me, give me all your heart.
We're making real love.
Come into my world.
Please come closer to me, so I can feel you.
So I can stay in your embrace.
Come to me.
Take me, take me, take me to your heart.
I'll show you real love now and forever.
Being together with you, this moment...
This looks really good on you too.
Since your figure is so good to begin with.
I'll take this.
And this, this, this... and that.
- I'm going to wear this out.
- Yes.
Uh, hey Yoo Na.
You bought a new ski outfit and new skis?
You already have some.
Hey, what if my dad sees me loading the car and I get caught?
Aigoo, you just didn't want to wear a 2-year old outfit.
Of course, since I couldn't go during my time at the institute.
Anyhow, I'm going up ahead and skiing, so don't be late.
I just need to check inventory so I'll be leaving shortly.
I'm really looking forward to it.
Hey, just thinking about it, I feel like my heart is going to burst,
Hey, it's all because of me, the complimentary ticket and the suite, even!
Don't forget it.
So I took two more of my mom's credit cards.
But, how did you keep your dad from going to the Appointment Ceremony?
Lee Yoo Na, don't you know I have a sharp mind?
My IQ, 128!
I heard you lost consciousness!
You lost consciousness and 911 had to come haul you off, and when you arrived at the hospital, you were suddenly okay?
!
Yes, I guess so.
Then, why'd you collapse at home?
You collapsed suddenly, your eyes rolled, and you couldn't breathe.
That's what I heard!
So maybe, could it have been anemia?
At your size, anemia?
Anemia?
Anemia has nothing to do with size.
So you collapse with anemia, and near death, you called me?
When you weren't even going to die?
On a day like today.
Exactly at that hour!
If it was that important to snap a photo with your daughter in a prosecutor's robe, then you should have gone, whether you're mourning for your wife or not.
What did you come for?
I came to mourn for my wife.
I came because I thought you were dying.
Otherwise, would I have missed my daughter's appointment ceremony?
Oh my...
It's the day that Ma Sang Tae's daughter becomes a prosecutor.
A prosecutor!
Prosecutor Ma Hye Ri!
I should have gotten a picture at least.
You're about as useful as dog dung!
You worried a lot, didn't you, President Ma?
Doctor Kang.
My wife... what happened?
Fly high, so fly high, so fly high!
Because of my prosecutor daughter, it looks like I'll be getting a CT scan, an MRI, the works!
It's not a bad thing to get your health checked.
I had my regular exam last month.
Mom, are you getting mad at me?
I know if you can't do what your mind is set on, your stubbornness is unbearable, so I went with it.
But I'm wondering if I really have to go this far.
I can be a prosecutor even if I don't go to the workshop, but if it's not today, I may never see this baby.
Mom, this baby is going to be the finishing touch to your daughter's life.
I told you not to use words I don't know!
The look on your father now makes me think he'll grind us to a pulp if he finds out.
There's no way I'm going to get caught.
Mom, I'll bring home a pretty baby for you too.
Okay, it's a Grace bag for me.
Okay!
We're creating a love that won't ever stop
When you fall, when things get tough, when you start to hate hiding it,
Be yourself and hold my hand.
Hey, fly to your dream!
Now it's time to fly!
The heart will burn up.
Engines, turn up.
The dreams hidden in the heart will unfold.
Believe only me
I'll hold your hand.
I can make your dream come true.
Fly high.
As expected, she went to ski first.
[Launch Ceremony Auction]
Gioberni Launch Ceremony Auction.
9:00.
If Kim Dong Seok is really coming to the ski resort, he'll probably attend, don't you think?
He didn't come to ski, but probably came to see that.
This brand obtained almost all of Grace Kelly's clothes.
Even now, there is a limited edition of the Grace line, and apparently, the women are crazy about it.
Because women all dream of being a princess.
Ma Hye Ri.
Prosecutor Ma Hye Ri, you've suffered much.
You've worked hard;
I'm proud of you.
Now your suffering is all over.
What's left in your life now, is to go on the count of one!
Prosecutor Yoon went where?
Three years ago, there was a case called Watchgate where 80,000 won watches were sold at a launch show, as Swiss name brands, to the tune of 200 Million Won.
The one where even celebrities bought in great quantities?
The wealthy, celebrities, and retailers lost almost 30 Billion Won,
But during the search for evidence, they lost the suspect, Kim Dong Seok, right in front of their eyes.
It turns out he was working the local circuit in black market counterfeit brands.
Was that Yoon Se Jun's case?
Today, there's a brand name launch at that ski resort.
They received a tip that Kim Dong Seok might go there.
Might go?
On a tip that he might go, not that he will go, the prosecutor raced up there?
Without even reporting to the Chief?
Chief, that's the guy.
Ahh.
That's the guy?
He's been searching for him for three years.
But still...
He should have reported before he left.
All right.
Get to work.
[Counterfeit Goods Suspect Search]
They say it's the most popular ski suit this year.
But, what kind of history do you have with this guy that you would...
Because Gioberni is a brand that's popular with the Hollywood set, it's got a stamp of approval in this country too.
If they launch and set up operations, then the fakes will surface right away, so-called "brand name" products any dog or cow can forge.
The first guy to copy it will hit the jackpot.
Since copying the design is the object, he'll show up at the launch show.
Take a good look.
Oh, what time is it?
Already?
!
Why hasn't Yoo Na even called?
Ah, my phone.
Oh?
Hey!
Thief!
Hey!
It's a thief!
Hey!
Hey!
Stop there!
Wh-what...
What should I do?
Oh no, what now?
Report him.
Police!
Oh no, he even took my phone.
What am I supposed to do?
!
Aigoo.
My cards.
My cards.
My cards!
Your car was broken into?
Please report it to the police and have them come, and check me into the suite.
Ah yes.
No!
Report it.
But, don't have them come right away.
Have them come after the launch show.
Ah, yes.
Oh no, no, no.
I'll go to my room and report it, so just check me in.
Yes.
But someone has already checked into the suite room.
Excuse me?
Someone has checked in?
They just checked in.
Ah!
Oh, that's fine.
That girl is a ditz.
Yoo Na!
Yoo Na, open the door!
C'mon!
Oh, Yoo Na, I...
Who are you?
You're the one who rang the bell and knocked on the door.
Uhhh, that's because... that's our room...
Did Yoo Na bring you?
No.
Then why are you in there?
Because it's my room.
Excuse me?
They say they definitely have a record of someone giving your name and cancelling the room.
Someone else has already checked in here.
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know.
I definitely reserved the suite and never cancelled it.
Ahh, I'm gonna go nuts.
Anyhow, it was your responsibility so you come and resolve it.
Where are you and why aren't you here yet?
I left you a message that I couldn't make it.
I kept calling, but you wouldn't answer.
You can't make it?
!
There was a reservation for a party dress presentation, but the party was suddenly moved earlier.
It looks like I'm going to be here all night.
Hey, my bag was stolen!
You have to come no matter what!
The clients have already come and are waiting for me.
Are you still in Seoul?
Hey, how much is it?
I'll give it to you, so come right now and bring your card.
They are VVIP clients.
It's not just one, it's eight.
So, I'm asking how much is that?
!
I said I'd give it to you!
Hye Ri, I'm sorry.
Hey!
Hey!
If you don't come, what am I supposed to do?
What about the Gioberni launch show?
What about my Grace shoes?
!
If you don't come, you and I are through!
Hey!
Hello?
Hey, Yoo Na!
Hey!
Oh?
Oh geez!
You heard it, right?
My friend never cancelled the reservation.
It seems that way, but on our hotel computer, it's definitely shown as cancelled.
Oh, that's fine.
I'll give it up.
Just give me another room since I have to change.
- Quickly, quickly...
- We don't have any empty rooms.
You don't?
It's the Valentine's season, and next week our ski resort will be closed.
Then, where am I supposed to sleep tonight?
Then, I can't give up this room.
You heard that there are no empty rooms, right?
So?
- So you should give up the room.
- Why?
Because I'm a man and you're a woman?
We made the reservation first, and the cancellation, when it's been investigated, will certainly turn out as a hotel error.
A hotel error, not my error.
I've already paid for the hotel room.
I'll give you double the cost of the room.
I'll give you double what you paid for the hotel.
When?
Excuse me?
When are you going to give me twice the cost of the room?
Didn't you say you lost your wallet?
Do you have cash?
I can tell them to send the money to the hotel.
Tell who?
My father.
Ah, there was that method.
Then, where would I go?
When there's no empty rooms?
Well, well, is this the only hotel?
You can go to another hotel.
Then you do that.
Guest, where shall I put this?
Please leave it on the table.
- Yes.
- Thank you.
Do you think a man would use a suite alone on Valentine's Day?
If you weren't going to give it up, then why were you acting like you were going to give it up?
When did I?
Didn't you ask me when I was going to pay you, whether or not I had cash?
I was just thinking maybe you forgot that you lost your wallet, so I was just reminding you.
Guest, our manager said he would find a room for you nearby.
Is there a hotel nearby?
It's not a hotel, but a motel.
Mo-tel?
It's definitely not the hotel's error, but because your situation seems so dire...
I've relayed the message, so I'll be stepping out now.
What, what do they take me for?
Do you want to use the room together?
I can't give you the whole suite, but I can let you sleep here.
What are you saying?
If you don't have a place to go, I thought I'd let you share a room.
Even if I have one room,
I don't think it would be that bad.
Aren't you waiting for your girlfriend?
I am waiting for a woman.
Are you crazy?
I have an announcement.
Shortly, beginning at 9 o'clock, the Gioberni Launch Ceremony Auction will begin.
All clients who plan to attend are asked to gather in ten minutes.
Please let me repeat...
Oh?
Ah!
It's a relief there's just one thing I don't take after my mother in, not feeling sleepy in the early evening.
Mom.
We're not getting a divorce.
Why not?
Because you're pregnant?
You said once, didn't you...
Sang Shik is a good man.
Oh!
Aigoo.
Let's go.
I'm sorry, but can I borrow your phone?
I've forgotten mine.
I don't see him.
What about you?
I don't see him yet.
It's been over an hour since it started.
He's been on the run for three years.
His funds are probably gone.
They don't say a life of crime is scary for nothing.
And an accomplice might be here in his place.
An accomplice?
Someone could win a bid on a product and make a copy, so during the auction, keep a sharp lookout.
Don't just look at the men, but be wary of the women as well.
Okay.
Gioberni, a company that with a 133 year history, has a tradition of launching lines overseas with a launch auction.
At this Korean launch, we are featuring the very special and prized limited edition Grace line.
The proceeds of the sales will go to feed the nation's children in poverty, so we ask for your generous interest.
Then we'll begin.
Can I borrow your phone just once more?
It's behind me so just take it.
Is the auction over already?
No, not yet.
Then why did you call me?
Have you taken all the pictures?
[Have you been caught?
]
Hello?
The wedding shoes that Grace Kelly wore were remade with a modern style and are a classic Gioberni Limited Edition.
Each year, only 7 pairs are made by the head designer...
Mom, they have to send the money to the hotel, no matter what.
Okay?
No matter what.
... this one especially for the Korea launch auction.
Then we'll start the bidding at 1.8 million won.
1.9 2 million
2.2 2.3
2.5 2.7
2.8
The bid is at 2.8 million.
3 million.
Yes, 3 million.
4 million.
It's at 4 million.
4.5
It's at 4.5 million
5 million.
5 million.
6 million.
6 million.
No other bids?
6 million.
If there's no bid higher than 6 million.
7 million.
We have a bid at 7 million.
There are no more bids?
Grace Wedding Shoes have been sold to client number 7.
Oh thank you!
Thank you, thank you!
Yeah, Prosecutor Jin.
Yeah.
What?
Client, really why are you doing this?
I'll leave my car as collateral.
You can keep my car overnight, and I'll bring the money in the morning.
We have to go back to Seoul tonight too.
Let's take my car.
That works out well since I live in Seoul too.
You ladies don't seem to understand the legalities very well.
Section Chief Lee, Kim Dong Seok has come with a woman.
Is there anything in the Gioberni Auction documents
Her name is Lee Moon Hae.
Prosecutor Jin said she got a rental car.
that requires the winning bidder payment within a few hours?
So, find the women from the auction.
There isn't, is there?
So, as the winning bidder...
This won't do.
Let's report it to the police.
- Okay
- Just a moment!
I came just for this baby.
I didn't come to ski.
I came to get this baby, but when I got here, my bag was stolen.
Just a second.
Oh?
That man.
Excuse me a minute
You thief!
You jerk!
Where's my bag?
!
Where did you go and sell my bag?
!
Prosecutor!
What are you?
!
Move!
Prosecutor, are you okay?
Kim Dong Seok.
Kim Dong Seok?
Prosecutor?
Not a detective?
My shoes.
Where's my baby?
Where are my shoes?
Someone else bought them.
My shoes?
You sold them?
How can you do that?
I won the bidding.
I'm sorry.
If you have a problem with how we handled it, please take legal actions.
Oh!
Oh!
Oh, you can't, Prosecutor!
You can't, you can't!
Call for back up right away, and block all the car exits.
And don't let the Lee Moon Hae's rental car get out.
Okay.
I'll get cooperation from the local police,
So search the parking lot and find the car.
Ahh, and after you were so right on with your feeling that Kim Dong Seok was here!
Today wasn't supposed to be like this.
This isn't supposed to be a day like this.
I lost my shoes.
And I'm hungry.
And I want to go home.
Mom.
Oh!
why is everything going wrong today?
!
Why are you doing this to me, really?
!
Client, your insurance company people have arrived at our ski resort.
Really?
Yes, but there are two broken down cars near the ski slope, and on the lower side there are also two cars waiting.
Altogether four cars?
Yes.
How long do they say I have to wait?
I think at least two to two and a half hours.
Just a moment.
There have been no phone calls for client Ma Hye Ri.
Why don't you call somewhere else?
Maybe a friend of a friend or well maybe your in-laws' second cousins?
There are lots of people.
You don't think I want to?
Other than the numbers of Mom, Dad, Home and Yoo Na,
Im Mi Kyung 6, Go Min Ji 7, Jee Hin 8, Hae Sook 35, aesthetician 11,
Im Ki Sa 53, Yoo Kang Ho 17.
I just remember the quick dial numbers.
Oh?
Those are my shoes.
Who is it?
Uh?
What are you doing here?
I'm here to share the room, I mean, you told me I could share the room.
Wouldn't that be a little complicated for us to share the same room?
No, no, I'm saying I'll use the empty room.
Really?
I was going to Seoul, but the tire's flat.
And the service people won't be here for another two and a half hours.
What an unlucky day.
I guess your girlfriend will say I can't?
Use the second floor.
But, you have to pay half.
Ask your girlfriend first.
She hasn't come?
She's not going to come?
I'm waiting.
Ahh.
I'll see you in the morning.
Mmm.
Is he going night skiing and waiting till she gets here?
He must really like her.
Whoever she is, she's a lucky woman.
She didn't come to a man that would prepare this kind of thing for her?
She didn't come because she didn't know.
What will we do if he leaves his car and flees?
- He's probably already fled.
- Excuse me?
We can block the cars from leaving this way, but there are tons of little paths that people can come and go through.
Ay, if it wasn't for that nut-job, we could have caught Kim Dong Seok.
It's done.
- Section Chief Lee, look in the trunk.
- Yes.
She won't come.
She's not coming.
That woman doesn't have the right to wear Grace shoes.
Really, why would you give shoes to a woman who doesn't even show up.
Tch, are shoes that laughable?
Are they laughable?
Are they laughable?
Move!
Get away!
You wanna die!
Get away!
Move!
Move, move!
Get away.
This door and the bathroom door were all open.
Hurry, get out!
Get out!
Give me your car keys.
So, she really didn't come.
I just ordered.
Because I figured the one getting a free meal wouldn't make a fuss about the menu.
Who's getting a free meal?
I'm going to pay it all back.
This is my style.
It's good I ordered that.
You're swollen, aren't you?
Are you swollen?
How much is enough?
Half the hotel room, the breakfast, and what else?
Ah, the tire repair cost.
How much was it?
Write it all down.
Don't leave out a won.
Why don't you add another 100,000 won?
I have to put gas in the car and pay the toll gate.
You know you're asking a total stranger for 100,000 rather shamelessly, don't you?
Write down your account number;
I can get it transferred right away.
I don't have my account number memorized.
You don't have your account number memorized?
!
The secretary does the banking.
Or I do internet banking.
Call me when you get the money.
You're not going to check my identity?
What if I don't call?
What are you going to show me so that I can check your identity?
Your citizen registration?
You don't have your ID.
You're not going to pay me back?
Why wouldn't I pay you back?
It's not like it's that much.
Fine, then.
Yesterday, you were stood up, weren't you?
The woman you were waiting for didn't show up.
Then, what are you going to do with those?
She didn't come because you bought that sort of thing and waited.
You're not supposed to buy shoes for a woman you like.
They say she'll put them on and walk off with another man.
Is there such a saying?
How entertaining.
I should give them to her and see if that really happens.
What if they don't fit?
Do you know her shoe size?
They probably fit.
I knew it.
That Grace line, not any woman can wear them.
You know Paris Hilton, right?
No matter how much money she has, she can't wear them.
Because her feet are too big.
Paris's feet are 280, but those Grace shoes only come in Grace Kelly's size, which in our country's sizing is 235.
Are you a shoeholic?
You know all kinds of trivia.
Is your girlfriend 235?
Well, there are lots of women who seem to want them, even though they can't wear them.
So, you're going to give them to her?
Is there any reason I can't?
Why would you give them to a woman who never even came?
!
Then what should I do?
I can't give them to just anyone, and I can't throw them away.
You can sell them to me.
Their owner was originally me.
If I just hadn't lost my bag...
I won them in the bid, but you bought them when I wasn't looking.
Are you making a fuss right now?
I... came here to buy those shoes.
But after coming here, I lost my bag, got my reservation cancelled, slept upright, and went through all sorts of hell!
Do you have to toss them to a woman who doesn't even want them?
Do you?
Give me, give me, give me all your heart.
We're making real love.
Come into my world.
Please come closer to me so I can feel you.
So I can stay in your embrace.
Come to me.
Take me, take me, take me to your heart.
I'll show you real love now and forever
Being together with you,
Oh my gosh!
this moment,
I wish time would stop.
Together with you forever.
I must be too late to get into your heart.
Someone else is already there,
I know very well.
But I have no choice,
I keep falling, falling into your heart.
Ta da!
Aren't they pretty?
Aren't they pretty?
They're lovable, yet sexy!
Huh?
Huh?
Well, they don't look worth writhing over for a couple of years.
All the women who've worn these wedding line shoes have all become happy.
Who wore them and how did they become happy?
You know Demi Moore.
She married a man 16 years younger than her.
Demi met Austin after she started wearing this line.
And Grace Kelly became a princess.
But what money did you buy these with?
Didn't you say your bag was stolen?
Huh?
Call me when you get the money.
Where'd it go?
Where'd it go?
Oh geez.
You still haven't been able to find it?
I can't find it anywhere!
Where'd it go?
You said you didn't even have your bag and put it in your pocket.
I did, but it's not here.
Aigoo, with the shoes...
If I don't pay this back, he's going to think I'm a total con!
But he loaned you all that money, and he only gave a measly phone number?
Do I look like I'd rip someone off?
But still...
With such deep pockets, you think he might be a second generation tycoon?
Where is it?
Welcome.
Aigoo, Nui (sister)!
Welcome Master Seo.
I told you to go out with your friends if you're lonely to the point of tears.
You're so lonely, you can't even swallow the soju.
How'd you know?
It's been over two hours since you opened the soju bottle.
It's flat and tepid.
Next time I'm born, I'm going to have to live with a man that's an artist.
So, you want to live with a man again the next time you're born?
How tedious.
To live with a man who would know what a woman is feeling before she opens her mouth,
I just want to know what that would feel like.
What's happened in the last few days that you're talking like this?
Who is it this time?
Then are you an official prosecutor starting tomorrow?
Where's your office?
For a few months, I don't get my own office.
I have to learn in a sunbae's (senior's) office.
In any case, children and adults alike will come in front of you and address you as Prosecutor, right?
Prosecutors are addressed Prosecutor, Teachers addressed Teacher,
Reporters addressed Reporter...
Why get so excited about something that's basically obvious?
Are all titles created equal?
A long time ago, even newbie judges and prosecutors were called Lord.
It's not like that these days, Dad.
It's totally different from a long time ago.
Right, right.
Prosecutors these days get badmouthed at the drop of a dime.
What do you know about it?
Geez.
I'm not making it up.
- In the newspapers and on the TV...
- Eh hey!
Wherever ten people gather, there will be good, bad and strange folk mixed in.
But if a rich man is ruined, he can still survive one way or another for three years.
You think that saying is for nothing?
Whatever is he talking about?
Our household, with Hye Ri, has gone up a rung and our status...
All of us, especially you, should make a little more effort.
Aigoo.
Prosecutor.
Oh!
Good Morning.
What are you doing here so early this morning, the set of you?
You said a new appointee was coming today and not to be late.
Was that today?
Yes.
I hear that this new appointee is a piece of work.
Quite a reputation at the Judicial Research and Training Institute.
Chief, it looks like you're in for a bit of a headache.
Maybe at the training center, but could it still be true now?
Fly high, so fly high, so fly high!
Go to the sky!
So fly high, so fly high, so fly high!
Go to the sky!
Prosecutor Lee, it looks like your eyes may fall out.
I was just wondering if it was our new appointee.
It couldn't possibly be, could it?
It looks like she might be here to collect payment on some credit.
It's not our division, is it?
Hello.
Oh, good morning!
Of course the new appointee should come early and be waiting.
Ah, hello.
I'm Prosecutor Ma Hye Ri.
They told me to come to Central District, Criminal Justice Division 5 starting today.
Ahhh, ah, yes.
Ah, um, um.
Go introduce yourself to the District Attorney and the Assistant DA.
Ah, yes, okay.
Did you go introduce yourself?
Yes.
Is there something you want to say to me?
It's this office.
First introduce yourself to the head prosecutor, and then, see me later.
Yes, okay.
[Prosecutor Yoon Se Jun] [Seoul Central District Prosecutor's Office]
[Criminal Justice Division 5] [Head Prosecutor]
So this woman is Lee Moon Hae, Kim Dong Seok's partner.
So, then who was the nut-job who jumped on you that time?
What can I help you with?
Can you tell me where Prosecutor Yoon Se Jun might be?
Who are you?
I'm prosecutor Ma Hye Ri, and I'm supposed to be training in this office.
Prosecutor?
Ahh, I had heard a new prosecutor appointee was supposed to come in.
I'm Section Chief Lee Woo Hyung.
Prosecutor.
I'm prosecutor Yoon Se Jun.
Ah, hello.
I'm prosecutor Ma Hye Ri...
You jerk!
Where's my bag?
Where have you sold off my bag?
Oh!
Prosecutor Ma Hye Ri?
Ah, yes.
Section Chief Lee, you've met.
And this is Office Administrator Jin Mi Sun.
Ah, hello.
I'm prosecutor Ma Hye Ri.
Your desk is over there.
Yes.
He doesn't recognize me?
Please sit.
He must really not remember me.
... and each went their own way?
You say it's not so?
Then, are you admitting to the charge?
If I admit to the crime, can I get out faster?
Are you admitting to the charge?
If I can get out quickly by saying I did it, then let's say that I was the one who threw away the memory card.
Are you trying to negotiate with a prosecutor right now?
How could that be?
!
The room is so filled with the smell of cosmetics, that my mind is dizzy.
Hey, Agassi (young lady).
Get me a glass of water, will you?
Pretty Agassi,
I'm dying of thirst.
I'm not an agassi.
I'm a prosecutor.
Agassi, you say you're a prosecutor?
Can't I be questioned by the pretty prosecutor?
Ahjussi, what are you doing?
Where are you looking?
What the hell is going on?
!
This kind of thing happens because a prosecutor doesn't act like a prosecutor.
You need to come to the prosecutor's office as a prosecutor, not as a woman.
So, you're saying my skirt length today is a little too short, and that my stockings are excessive, right?
I will tone it down starting tomorrow.
I think that, um, each person has a very different style.
Didn't you say there was something else that the new appointee was responsible for?
Not just as the new appointee, but as the newest prosecutor, there's a lot that you need to do.
- Follow me.
- Yes.
Every day before noon, get your sunbae's opinions, organize a menu, organize a menu, make restaurant reservations, and collect the lunch money.
Sunbae, it's time for lunch.
Track down your sunbaes each month on payday, to collect the lunch money.
- Sunbae, it's lunch time.
- Ah, okay.
And there is the responsibility of the daily, weekly, and monthly publications.
For each of the cases that the sunbaes are managing, the new appointee will do a short summary of any relevant articles.
Yes.
Prosecutor, there is a welcome dinner out tonight.
Since you've flipped the office upside down on your first day, let's try to make up for it at dinner.
Um, but why are we just standing here?
We're waiting for the sunbaes and then going to the restaurant together.
We're going to dinner tonight and now, lunch too?
I can miss it if I have a previous engagement, right?
Aigoo!
I'll see you at dinner.
[Prosecutor Lee Min Seok, Prosecutor Choi Ji Yoon, Prosecutor Jin Jung Seon...]
Prosecutor, here are your cases.
R cases again.
Ask, if you have any questions.
Okay.
Today, in the company of these capable and solid hoobaes (juniors), and undoubtedly headed to become that kind of hoobae, the prosecutor with great fashion sense, newly appointed Ma Hye Ri, I'm in a great mood.
In the hopes that yet another hoobae will serve well our country and our people...
May you become a big prosecutor!
Yes.
Prosecutor Ma.
Here comes another one.
Where are we going for the second round?
Second round.
Ah.
Ah, yes, we should go for a second round.
Let's go for a second round.
Let's go, let's go.
Thank you.
Our office newbie!
I have a charm that's easy to be afraid of.
It's all to tempt you.
Hand and foot, do it!
Turn on the moonlight, and shine it on my heart!
Haha!
Why do you keep looking at me-ee?
Have you gone and fallen for me-ee?
When someone's hot for me, I don't know what to do.
I don't even know how to act
I'm so hot.
I'm too pretty.
I'm so hot.
I'm too charming...
- Oh, no no no...
- Third round...
Go on home, Chief.
Go carefully!
- Goodbye
- Goodbye.
Let's go for a third round.
Third round.
Eh?
- Let's go for third round.
- Goodnight!
Prosecutor Ma!
Where'd it go?
I'm so hot...
Aigoo!
Let's just go for a third round on our own.
You went out for dinner and ate recklessly, didn't you?
What did you eat?
How much did you eat?
Get on.
Aigoo, geez.
You went down 300 grams.
I told you I didn't eat.
About Prosecutor Ma, it was a little shocking yesterday, wasn't it?
It didn't look like she would get overly stressed.
I wonder how much of a better state she'll be in today.
She doesn't seem like the type to change overnight.
Are you two dating?
Why did you ride in together?
Are you married?
!
Sunbae, please go on in first.
Prosecutor Ma, didn't you assure me yesterday, you'd rectify the way you dressed?
I did rectify it.
This is 1 centimeter longer than the skirt I wore yesterday, and I'm not wearing fishnet stockings, either.
Are you playing with me?
Do you seriously hear what you're spitting out?
Just because you can spit out words, doesn't mean they're worth saying!
How can a new appointee stand in front of a sunbae and tell a bald-faced lie.
But, I was just doing it out of consideration for you in my own way.
What?
It's better than saying from the beginning that I absolutely don't want to.
Absolutely don't want to?
What?
Then, are you saying you're going to keep dressing like that?
In the constitution, there's a clause about the personal pursuit of happiness.
We are public servants, representing the country.
In the National Public Service Laws, is there anything about the length of a woman's skirt or standard of makeup?
As a public servant, there is a level of form and dignity we need to maintain.
Is that level specified by law?
Hey, Ma Hye Ri!
Before I'm a prosecutor, I'm a woman, so I'm going to exercise the right to dress how I want.
You want to prance around like that even after getting sexually harassed by suspects yesterday?
You can't avoid making bean paste because you're afraid of maggots.
If you're going to be like this, don't be a prosecutor!
- Excuse me?
- You!
Do you know how hard it is to be a prosecutor in this country?
It's people like you that give female prosecutors a bad name!
Even prosecutors that aren't female get badmouthed when they deserve it.
Are you saying you're going to continue like this to the end?
!
But, you saying whether I should be or not be a prosecutor, there's really no legal right for you to be saying that, is there?
I'll be going now.
Unbelievable.
Mun Young Ho, you took someone else's wallet, not yours, out of the Internet Cafe, correct?
Yes.
And you took the money out, correct?
Yes.
Oh.
And it looks like you threw the empty wallet out in the bathroom?
Yes.
And the amount of money you took from the wallet was 63,000 won.
- Um...
- Just a second.
With that 63,000, you ate pork belly with your wife, paid hospital bills and bought rice.
Is that all correct?
That's true, Prosecutor, but...
You were caught because the hall surveillance camera caught you taking the wallet into the bathroom.
Right?
- Prosecutor...
- Wait just a moment.
The law for repeat offenders states that there will be an added penalty to your sentence.
...added penalty...
But even so, we can't let a thief off.
I'm not asking you to let a thief off, but you could have fined him instead.
It's not necessarily befitting to be absolutely penalty-minded.
If it goes to court and gets an added penalty, he could get a prison sentence.
But, I only acted on the fundamental principles.
After doing time for robbery, before three years passed, he robbed again.
You have to consider his situation as well.
He hurt his arm and couldn't work for three months, so his pregnant wife couldn't go to the hospital, and starved for two days.
Why do I... need to consider his personal situation?
I'm a prosecutor, not a social worker.
How could I consider each of the personal situations of the hundreds of suspects that come in every month?
Well, what you're saying isn't wrong.
Let's stop talking about it.
What a strange person.
What's he doing here?
Did he come to collect his money?
Please, have a seat.
Okay.
No, he can't!

I would really like to get it in cash.
Do you think there's a curse on the ski resort?
The two men you met at the ski resort both turned out not to like you.
I have my own schedule every night.
- Hey!
- Why am I...
How could you not know what you've done wrong?
!
In choosing this career, there is one thing you must do, whether you like it or not, being prudent and cautious.
I've met the person I had to meet.
Become independent?
Asa!
You came to congratulate my becoming independent?
Do you have an interest in me?
Of course.
Someone else is already there
I know very well, but I have no choice
I keep falling, falling into your heart.
Everyday
I want to be with you.
Tonight should I tell you that I like you?
Making shining light, making hot love together, making you my baby, come to my world.
Give me, give me, give me all your heart.
We're making real love.
Come into my world.
Please come closer to me so I can feel you.
So I can stay in your embrace, forever with you.
Brought to you by WITH S2 Written In The Heavens Subbing Squad
Mr. Go Man Chul, Yong Jin Construction which is being run under your name, it's just a company which exists on paper right?
Yes.
You don't actually run the business, do you?
That's right.
I don't.
I only lent my name.
Mr. Go Man Chul, who is the person that borrowed the use of your name?
Ma Sang Tae.
Who is that?
Ma Sang...
Looking at this, Prosecutor's surname is also Ma.
It's ST Construction's President Ma Sang Tae.
Ma...
Sang Tae?
He is a senior back at my old hometown.
Wait a moment.
Wait a moment.
Yes.
Yes.
I will contact you at another time.
It can't be.
Would Dad do such a thing?
What to do?
Should I report it?
What are you doing here?
Ah...
Why are you so surprised?
Eh?
Ah...
It's nothing.
Is the accused in Prosecutor Ma's office?
Ah...
The accused...
While I was investigating, I came here to find something that I lost.
What is it?
Ah...
I didn't find it.
Maybe it's still in my office.
Aish...
Why is she taking such a long time in the washroom?
Can't the Prosecutor even go to the washroom?
Prosecutor.
Are you all right?
I'm sorry.
We'll continue the investigation tomorrow.
I'm not feeling well now.
Eh?
Just now she was so determined, yet in the end she suspended the investigation.
It seems a little weird.
Ma...
Sang Tae?
Ma Hye Ri.
Ma Sang Tae.
Hey.
My daughter is in law school now.
She is going to be a prosecutor.
It's Sang Tae hyung's...
Ah...
What have I gotten myself into?
Aigoo...
Something major is going to happen!
Hey there!
Prison Warden!
Prison Warden!
I have something to say.
That fellow called Go Man Chul is like a stray dog on the streets.
It's just like what we expected.
She found out about Ma Sang Tae?
I heard that Ma Hye Ri suspended the interrogation with Go Man Chul, and is on her way to ST Construction now.
Is it?
I'm sure she suffered a shock.
That's only temporary.
Did you take a plane here?
How did you reach here so fast?
Dad.
I came to find you because I have something to ask.
Why don't you sit down first?
Have a drink?
I don't need to drink anything.
What is so urgent that you don't even have the time to drink some water?
I'm too anxious.
What is it?
Dad, do you know a person called Go Man Chul?
Is that why you rushed all the way here?
Go Man Chul that jerk.
Dad, it's not you right?
What are you doing?
Why did you rush here when you knew it wasn't me?
Do you want the Prosecutor's Office to misunderstand?
Eh?
There's nothing to say.
Hurry up and go back to report this matter.
What is going on?
Why did Go Man Chul say that you borrowed his name?
How would I know?
I'm his senior at the old hometown, so I helped him out and gave him pocket money sometimes.
He wanted to do business with me, but I refused.
He even sounded quite righteous when he was asking me for money.
Then you're saying that you and Yong Jin Construction have no connection right?
From a business point of view, it can't be said our relations aren't pure like water, but still.
But I'm definitely not being old and muddleheaded.
It's your dad you know.
That's right.
That's right.
I knew it was like this.
Then now it's all right for you to continue the investigation?
No.
I cannot investigate if we're related by blood.
I have to report to my section chief, and then I'll withdraw from the investigation.
The investigation will be handed to other prosecutors.
Really?
Then quickly report it to your section chief, before you end up in trouble.
Go Man Chul has already pointed you out, so you might need to undergo some investigation.
Since I have to undergo investigation,
I'd rather wish to have my prosecutor daughter investigate me herself.
It's such a pity.
Lawyer Seo!
Oh!
Ah!
Where did you come from?
What were you thinking?
You didn't even notice me.
Oh?
It's the first time we're holding hands.
Where are you going?
For a walk, and then to the shops.
I've finished my milk too.
Do you need me to buy more for you?
Anything else to buy?
Let's go together.
I think I have a lot of things to buy.
Okay.
I didn't work overtime today.
Do you know why?
Something must have happened.
Do you know what a frustrating incident I came across today?
Remember the person called Go Man Chul?
The accused that refused to talk?
Who?
That...
Do you know how to make a person who refuses to speak, speak?
I do.
How to do it?
You only lent out your name:
'I have nothing to say'.
That person found out that Mr. Go Man Chul was being detained, and asked you to hide for a period of time right?
Put more emphasis, more confidence.
Did he want to make use of your evasion to purposely delay the time?
Do not give the other party time to counteract.
Do as the law says then.
Right?
Well done.
But would the person behind Go Man Chul really instigate him in such a way?
I'm sure of it.
How would you know?
Firstly, if you wish to obtain information from the other party, you must be able to able to read their state of mind.
Secondly, you have to look into that person's background.
In detail and in all aspects.
To look into that person's background...
Means to investigate his background right?
He obviously has someone instigating him from behind, but yet he keeps silent.
Money definitely plays a part in this.
Eh...
There aren't much assets under Go Man Chul's name.
He hasn't earned much money in his whole life.
No assets now, doesn't mean that he didn't have them before.
Do you know his financial status from ten or twenty years ago?
Ten years, twenty years ago?
You have to look into it in more detail and in a broader scope.
The cause between human beings is even longer than one imagines.
That's right.
Fifteen years ago, he seemed to have a lot of money.
Go Man Chul.
Investigate his finances.
Would it be enough to check from twenty years ago?
According to what you taught me,
I managed to scare him, and he finally spoke.
But he said my father's name instead.
Prosecutor Ma's father?
Yes.
We can only allow him to confess about Manager Song.
Anyway, Manager Song was in fact in charge of that project.
Isn't he dead?
Since he's dead, let this be the end.
Do you mean to drag the corpse of Manager Song from his grave to plead guilty?
Hey...
Director Min.
I have met my Hye Ri.
If you wish to prevent Go Man Chul from identifying you, President, then we can only use Manger Song.
How can we trust his wife and children?
Manger Song was the person who died because he trusted me.
Would his wife and children keep this secret for the rest of their lives?
It would fine as long as we bear the compensation costs for the project and give those owners their required compensations.
I received a civil lawsuit, and you still want me to compensate?
Luckily, it has not been a long time since problems with the condominium's quality first occurred.
It would have been fine if Go Man Chul didn't get caught.
There is no other way.
If my daughter were not a prosecutor, this incident would not have mattered.
Didn't your father say that it wasn't him?
Isn't that enough?
That's true.
But it doesn't make me feel comfortable that Dad has to come to the Prosecutor's Office.
That's right.
How is it with that matter?
Didn't you say that you wanted to investigate Go Man Chul's finances?
I haven't received the report.
It's time consuming to investigate finances that were from a long time ago.
It would be good if the mastermind could be discovered directly from all those investigations.
You say you are scared of your father, but you don't hate him.
It's still Dad.
How can I hate him?
Although there are times I complain about being unhappy with him, but that's not hate.
I have never hated my Dad.
Lawyer Seo, have you hated your father before?
Never.
Not even a fleeting moment of disgust.
It seems like he is a very good man.
That's right...
Seeing as to how he so assuredly allowed Lawyer Seo to return to Korea, he's certainly a good father.
He used to be a father that would definitely keep his promises.
Promises?
Don't parents usually say "Okay", "I understand", "I'll do it", " Let's do it"?
But those are only words.
"I'll get it for you later", "Did I say that?", "I'm busy now", don't they all say that?
But my dad was different.
Not even once had he said those, even if it was for a very small matter.
He would say "I promise", and he would really do it for me.
He is really a great man.
So the words that my father said before...
Were all once...
Promises.
Were once promises?
Why do you use past tense?
He doesn't keep his promises now?
It is me who is unable to keep them.
It is me who is unable to keep them.
Not yet.
Hye Ri...
She has a guy that she likes.
No.
She has a guy that she loves.
No.
No.
She has a guy and they are mutually in love.
He's called Seo In Woo and he's a lawyer.
Yes.
Yes.
I've met him.
We've met.
He's very very smart, interesting, very handsome, and is very gentle.
So...
I will not let her go on a matchmaking date.
I'm the one who is not allowing her to go on a matchmaking date.
Here.
I do not need a husband who cannot even protect my daughter's happiness.
All right.
What is all right?
Are you referring to the divorce, or to give up the strategic marriage plans?
The things in this world cannot be expected to go according to my will.
Please answer clearly.
Do you wish to divorce me and then destroy Hye Ri's happiness?
Then...
That means you won't abandon me?
Yes.
No matter what...
This is such an important part of my life.
Oh my...
Oh my...
Hye Ri!
Mother has protected you.
Protected you!
Mother has cast everything aside and it really worked!
Mom.
Did Dad really say that?
Yes.
So no need to worry.
Go ahead and set a wedding date with Lawyer Seo.
What wedding?
Mom, I have told you before that there is nothing between Lawyer Seo and I.
Isn't your mutual attraction a fact?
No...
That...
Anyway, what's most important is that your Dad chose your Mom.
I'm hanging up.
Good night.
Dad?
Huh?
What is this?
Ah!
Luck is something that needs others to help you wish for.
Here.
Lucky crown.
It's a brooch.
So pretty.
I actually forgot.
So that's to say...
I've received a lot from Lawyer Seo.
He gave me a hand phone...
And an alarm clock...
Cooked for me...
Gave me suggestions...
It's really like that.
Why does Prosecutor Ma keep coming across such ridiculous things?
I apologize for not reporting this directly yesterday.
I was thinking of verifying it with my father first.
Aigoo...
Since the accused has made identification, you will have to give up this case.
Yes.
I have asked my dad to wait for the summons.
Since you have said it...
That's of course.
He said it's absolutely not him.
Prosecutor Yoon, you will have to carry on the investigation once again.
I will carry on the investigation.
Yes.
Sunbae.
Prosecutor.
These are the investigation reports regarding Go Man Chul.
Aigoo.
There is a marked improvement in investigation skills over at your side.
During the course of the investigation, Prosecutor Ma has collected a lot of data.
Data regarding Yong Jin Construction, project contracts and Go Man Chul financial status.
They are for your reference.
Please convey my thanks.
Yes.
First of all, call Mr. Ma Sang Tae and get him to come over.
Run a check on Mr. Ma Sang Tae's business and operations.
That's because Yong Jin Construction is a company from six years ago.
We also need to check Go Man Chul's financial status at that time.
Yes.
I understand.
You are especially handsome today.
Does it look good?
Of course it looks good.
A capable man would definitely wear it well.
This time, I need to appear handsome.
I have to appear to have depth and be an exemplary model.
Where are you going?
Ah.
What are you doing?
You said the person who borrowed your name is not Ma Sang Tae?
Yes.
It's actually not Ma Sang Tae.
I often had contact with that woman, which was arranged privately by Supervisor Song.
Then why did you say it was Ma Sang Tae?
Ma Sang Tae is my senior back at my hometown.
I went to borrow money from him as he is so wealthy, but I felt embarrassed when he refused to.
That day I saw that Ma Hye Ri happened to be Ma Sang Tae's daughter.
Oh...
Oh...
This time you will also be embarrassed...
So I said it.
Then what is your reason for submitting a new statement?
After thinking about it, I felt that I could not malign Sang Tae hyung in such a way.
It will also be revealed after an investigation.
Why did you identify a person who would be declared innocent after investigations?
Although I am very poor, I am also a person with emotions.
So I did such a thing in a fit of anger.
Then previously, why did you make use of your right to remain silent?
That Supervisor Song is already dead, so why do we have to talk about him?
It would only humiliate the dead.
Also at that time, I received some benefits.
When did Mr. Song died?
One year ago.
I even attended the funeral.
Did Go Man Chul find out the Supervisor Song is dead?
Is that why he is pushing the blame on him?
That still needs more investigating.
But the documents regarding Yong Jin Construction was handled by Mr. Song.
Really?
First of all, we need to verify the identity of the accused.
Hey.
Prosecutor Yoon.
How is Ma Hye Ri's father?
What is the outcome of the investigation?
Let's go.
Prosecutor, Mr. Ma Sang Tae is here.
Thank you for coming.
I am Prosecutor Yoon Se Jun.
I am Ma Sang Tae.
Please have a seat.
Yes.
Supervisor Song?
Song had independently left the company.
Did he have contact with Man Chul secretly?
You did not have any knowledge of it?
Would I have let them be if I had known?
That's true.
Even if I had known,
I would only be able to look on helplessly while they reaped profits together.
But why did Go Man Chul identify you?
Is there any use even if I said this and said that?
I only hope that this incident will not affect my daughter in a negative way.
I hope you can conduct a thorough investigation.
We will conduct this investigation with our best efforts.
Hello.
Yes.
Yes.
I understand.
Prosecutor.
Your father just left.
Really?
Go Man Chul has retracted his previous statement.
After investigations, your father and Yong Jin Construction did not have any financial transactions.
There is nothing to prove that there was any connection with Yong Jin Construction.
Oh!
That is great!
I heard that after Ma Sang Tae returned to the company after the investigation as nothing was found.
It seems that they can breathe a sigh of relief.
Who?
Ma Sang Tae and Ma Hye Ri.
- You haven't come in such a long time.
- Yes.
- Wah.
This is simply beautiful.
- It's really beautiful.
This one.
- This looks like it would match you very well.
- Take your pick.
Look at this one.
Is that too "loud"?
"Loud" would suit him.
Is that his style?
That prosecutor?
That girl is completely head over heels.
How handsome is he?
If I have time, I have to go to the Prosecutors' Office to take a look at that prosecutor.
Is that why you aren't tempted by that lawyer?
Oh...
Bin.
What are those photos?
Why do you have to ask me?
You really didn't go together with Ahjumma?
Did Ahjumma say that she went to view sakura trees with me?
Then what are all those photos?
Could Ahjumma go by herself?
Maybe she went with other people.
Dad, are you an idiot?
How can you have no insight at all?
What do you mean by that?
It's totally frustrating me.
Ahjumma really likes Dad.
What?
Do you think I have no insight?
This is what I think...
As long as Sunbae is happy, I'm happy.
From today onwards, I won't be able to take your car to work.
Why?
I plan to take some time in the morning and evening for some exercise.
[Ma Hye Ri]
Yes.
This is Seo In Woo.
Come to the balcony for a while.
Oi!
Oi!
Lawyer Seo.
Lawyer Seo!
Oi!
Lawyer Seo.
Lawyer Seo!
Lawyer Seo!
Oh...
My arms are sore.
Oh!
Hurry...
Hurry!
What is this?
I...
Although it's not very creative, but my attention span, memory and imitation skills are very strong.
My arms are sore.
Hurry!
The bucket is going to drop.
My Mom said that I should not allow others to keep taking care of me.
I thought about it and I felt that I owe Lawyer Seo a great deal.
So profound...
I really like the Lawyer Seo that always helps me out.
But this is not a declaration of love.
Ma Hye Ri...
You...
Why is this person so rude?
Morning.
We keep running into each other recently.
You didn't like it?
Whether or not you liked it, you should say something.
If you don't like it, I can bring it back to change.
What?
The bracelet.
Oh...
That...
I didn't take a good look.
I'm sorry.
I have an appointment.
We'll talk next time.
Why is the car still here?
Ah!
Prosecutor Yoon.
Hello.
How are you?
If you're looking for Jung Seon, she should have gone to the kindergarten.
Kindergarten?
I hurt my leg yesterday, so she's sending the child to school this morning.
She didn't inform you to pick her up from there?
Ah!
Yes!
Aigoo!
That silly girl.
She must have thought to send the child first, then to come back here later.
Why didn't Prosecutor Jin drive her car there?
It's because the little one insisted on walking there.
Carry me.
Carry you?
Only until there.
All right.
Let's see how much weight you've gained.
Grandma has really fed you lots of good food.
How long is the sentence?
Park Yoo Chul:
life sentence.
Woo Sung Mi:
life sentence.
Oh my, isn't that a bit too much?
Why is it too much?
Both of them committed murder.
It was the mother of his child and it was for money.
Besides that, they even killed her twice.
I'm worried that the Judge will not follow your judgment and pass the sentence.
I believe he will.
We're all human, but yet we have to decide the fate of another.
It does put a burden on one's self.
Victim assistance?
Didn't Sunbae mention it the previous time?
There must be a way to help the children of Choi In Sook.
You actually remembered.
And you were crying at that time.
My short-term memory for important information is still quite strong.
That's right.
There are many types of assistance for victims.
What do you think the children need?
Psychological treatment.
They are living with their grandmother now.
But the children suffered such a great shock that they are not even eating now.
All right.
Then it looks like we can request for it.
I shall get on it immediately.
Prosecutor Jin.
The person that is suspected for trespassing, his mother has applied to be present during the interrogation.
This is that case!
The case where you became the victim.
Oh!
The case that Sunbae is in charge of?
Han Byung Soo, you cannot go to other people's homes again.
Especially going to homes to eat, sleep and bathe.
Don't even think about it.
Although I am unable to understand using my logic, but the society in which I live in has such rules.
So I shall try my best to follow them.
When the owners return home, what do you do outside at night?
I will go to an internet cafe to prepare my resume.
Browse through recruitment advertisements.
Fill in application forms.
This child has always been the top student in school.
It's all because he could not find a job.
What is this?
For the fine.
This is the money I earned from selling vegetables.
I was thinking of buying a suit for him after he finds a job.
Money can always be earned back.
We will pay the fine.
Please be lenient on him.
Please keep this.
You can serve community service in place of a fine.
For example helping out at a farming village.
Aigoo!
Really?
That can be done?
This child grew up in a farming village.
He's skilled in all types of farm work.
It's just that he can't find a job.
Oh!
Who is this?
I heard that you were a Prosecutor.
I'm from Go Min University Business Faculty, graduated in the year 1995.
Which year did you graduate?
This child!
How is your boyfriend?
If I had known you have a boyfriend, I would have gone to another house.
I still respect personal privacy.
What boyfriend?
Why are you denying it?
I saw the two of you hugging each other tightly, and you did not even separate.
I think you are not in your right mind.
He's like this because he is not in the right mind.
Sunbae.
Is anything the matter?
I want to ask you something.
What is your relationship with Seo In Woo?
There isn't any relationship.
Then what about with Yoon Sunbae?
Why aren't you answering?
Ah...
This...
We are still not in any definite relationship yet.
But why are you asking this?
I think you seem a little weird.
I felt something was wrong when I went to your house the previous time.
What is going on between you and Seo In Woo?
Who is the person in your heart?
What do you mean by that?
If you are only playing around with Yoon Sunbae, then please let go.
Don't hurt Yoon Sunbae.
What?
I won't allow you to hurt him.
I won't let you off.
If Sunbae can say this in front of me, why can't you tell Yoon Sunbae that you like him?
Who can't say it?
I chose not to.
- Why?
- Because that's who I am.
For me, love is like this.
Choosing not to say you like him, is that still considered love?
I did not say it, as I was worried it would make him feel awkward.
And I was also scared of rejection, so I did not dare say it.
If you really like him, you would be unable to say it out easily.
I thought that you really liked Yoon Sunbae, and was wondering how deep your liking was for him.
Which was why I did not say I liked him and suffered by myself.
I...
I really like...!
I really like.
All this time, I thought that Yoon Sunbae was not yet ready.
So I waited until now.
Everyone has their own way of loving someone.
Don't think that your love is right just because Yoon Sunbae held your hand.
Why haven't Prosecutor Jin and Prosecutor Ma come in yet?
I didn't know that females like having their coffee outdoors.
What?
What?
Why are you like this?
What is it?
Did Prosecutor Ma do something wrong again?
Is that why Prosecutor Jin is scolding her now?
It was wrong.
She really did something wrong.
She snatched away something that someone painstakingly took care of, and yet pretended nothing happened.
It's not that serious.
She was the one that kept her feelings a secret.
Prosecutor Jin is also in the wrong.
Love and sauce are the same.
It gets more fragrant with time.
What are you two talking about?
Prosecutor Jin seems to be scolding Prosecutor Ma.
So I do not envy those single, unattached people.
Everyday thinking about 'to catch' or 'be caught'.
It's an exhausting process.
But marriage is still about honor.
I hate being single.
I really hate it.
Do you have the confidence to not run away and take responsibility for others?
Think about it carefully.
Did Lawyer Seo say that because he knew it would become like this?
What is the relationship between you and Seo In Woo?
Who is the person in your heart?
Now he doesn't even take the initiative to greet me.
Ah!
Chief couldn't have eaten it all up right?
Oh!
There's still some!
Cut!
Cut!
Cut.
Next step.
Break the egg.
Don't break the egg yolk.
Don't break the egg yolk.
I hate it when the soup becomes murky.
Don't let the egg yolk separate.
Leave it intact to cook.
You've got quite a few demands.
[Ma Hye Ri]
This is Seo In Woo.
Lawyer Seo, do you have ramen at home?
I'm starving, but what's left at home is only water.
I'll bring it over to you.
I also don't have any kimchi.
What are you doing?
Looking around your house.
It's not your first time here.
Come over.
It's ready.
That's right.
It's not the first time here.
Why does it feel like the first time?
Did you renovate?
No.
It must be delicious.
I shall not stand on ceremony then.
You must be busy recently.
Why?
I rarely see you.
Are you handling a lot of cases?
It seems she comes here quite often.
She used to be your girlfriend right?
Or were you two originally friends, before she became your girlfriend?
Jenny.
You're on your way here?
Dinner?
I'm eating ramen now.
You know the Prosecutor Ma who lives downstairs?
She came to borrow ramen, so I conveniently cooked some as well.
Bring it over.
We'll have it together.
I only had two mouthfuls.
Where are you now?
That's not far away.
All right.
See you in a while.
What is it?
I'm going back.
Finish before you go.
It's all right.
I'm done.
I've finished eating.
I'm leaving.
Thank you for your hospitality.
What's wrong with me?
Didn't you say you were starving?
You didn't even finish half of it.
The construction company involved in this case and other construction companies all said that they have never met Go Man Chul.
After resigning from ST Construction, that Song Ki Joon was also not seen again.
It has been eight years since he resigned from ST Construction.
So that is to say that Go Man Chul may not have anything to do with this.
There is no way to ask, as the person is dead.
The accounts are also managed very strictly.
We're unable to trace where the funds are used.
How are things with President Ma Sang Tae?
We have not uncovered any monetary transactions between Go Man Chul and President Ma Sang Tae.
What about with Song Ki Joon?
As he was a partner in the company, there have been some exchanges between them.
But no monetary transactions?
Yes.
Those at the condominium case are getting ready to file a lawsuit against Song Ki Joon.
Then the part regarding Go Man Chul lending his name is considered closed.
What's left is the charge regarding the forgery.
We can only sue, and apply for punishment.
There is no other way.
That's odd.
This case originally had many doubtful areas, but yet the outcome has become almost nothing.
What enmity!
Eat this.
Can you not make me worry about you?
You should also bring some kimchi over.
How can you just let me eat the bean curd by itself?
Kimchi?
You can still ask for kimchi?
Really.
Prosecutor.
This has finally come out.
What is that?
The previous time you requested for the past records of Go Man Chul's finances.
Only two were uncovered.
It looks like Go Man Chul's case can now be closed.
What's the content?
It looks like he has land, and he had them for a long time.
[Ma Sang Tae]
Dad actually bought land for Go Man Chul.
Why?
[May 23, 1995] [Title Transfer]
This...?
How did Go Man Chul obtain this land... from Ma Sang Tae?
I came here to ask you this.
Why are you asking me this?
Your apartment!
Didn't Go Man Chul buy it fifteen years ago after selling this land?
No it isn't!
It was bought using my own money.
Go Man Chul sold the land that same month, and bought the apartment for you.
September 1995.
Why are you asking me this?
What secret are you keeping for him?
'If it wasn't because I was keeping a secret'
What did you mean by that when you said it the previous time?
What did Go Man Chul do to have to use that piece of land as a reward?
You know it right?
No!
I don't know anything.
This is exciting, and I find it amusing.
What do you think?
I'm doing this not because it's exciting or amusing.
You are saying that I'm doing this because it's amusing?
I just feel that, you may be finding this very amusing.
You know I was only joking.
Yes.
I know.
Then why did you say that if you knew?
Seo In Woo.
Are you angry?
I'm not angry, and neither is it amusing.
To be honest, when I first heard your plan, I didn't quite believe it.
I wondered if things would go according to plan.
I thought that a small company might not be able to lure Ma Sang Tae over.
Wondered if Ma Hye Ri who was investigating the case, would discover the case of Ma Sang Tae and Go Man Chul from fifteen years ago.
I had doubts about that.
But things are now like this, so I think it's amazing and very interesting.
I'm also looking forward to what will come next, whether or not you're angry.
That's right.
It used to be called Jin Ri Construction.
[Death at Company 1995. 5. 23 (Tues)]
A murder occurred in Seoul.
The police were sent to investigate.
The construction Chief Mr. Seo was discovered near the scene of the crime and was arrested on the spot.
What sparked this incident was the disagreement between the Construction Company, and residents were forced to move.
Murder case.
I'm Prosecutor Ma Hye Ri from Seoul's Central District Office.
I came to look at the case records.
Yes.
I understand.
I'd like to take a look at the case records.
I'm a member of the family.
You may go in.
We've found it.
At nine o'clock, I was having a drink with Go Man Chul, a junior from my hometown.
I called him that day and arranged to meet during the day, at a bar called The Rose.
We weren't operating that day, but Man Chul is a regular customer, so I allowed him to come in.
In the end, it still came to this,
Hye Ri.
The number you're dialing is disconnected.
Please leave a message.
Lawyer Seo.
Why am I unable to reach you?
Where are you?
I'm at home.
I have something to tell you.
It's all right if it's late.
You must call me back.
I'll wait for you.
Lawyer Seo!
Lawyer Seo, are you in there?
Lawyer Seo!
Lawyer Seo!
Lawyer Seo!
Hello, Haneul Law Firm.
Is Lawyer Seo In Woo there?
May I ask who is this on the line?
I'm called Ma Hye Ri.
Please ask Lawyer Seo to answer the phone.
He's not here currently.
His hand phone is also unreachable.
Could something have happened?
I'm not sure about that.
Excuse me.
What time will he be back?
Did he mention that?
I'm not sure.
I'm looking for Lawyer Seo In Woo.
Lawyer Seo is not here currently.
Where did he go?
Is there a reason you are looking for him?
Don't you recognize me?
I came here a few times before.
I'm sorry.
I can't remember.
What time did Lawyer Seo leave?
Where did he go?
Could you please tell me who you are?
Where did he go?
May I ask what is your relationship with Lawyer Seo?
I'm sorry.
That... that female lawyer is called Jenny right?
Is she in?
You're looking for me?
Yes.
Hello.
You remember me?
Yes.
I'm looking for Lawyer Seo urgently, but his hand phone is switched off.
Can you help me contact him?
I'm afraid I can't.
Why?
It's not convenient to tell you here.
I'm sorry.
Lawyer Seo In Woo's private matters cannot be randomly told to anyone.
Goodbye.
Is the place he went to very far?
Will it take long?
Did he go on holiday?
I can't tell you anything.
Then please help me convey this to him.
Please tell him that Ma Hye Ri is looking for him, if he calls.
You must help me convey this.
Although I do not have any relationship with him, but you only have to tell him Ma Hye Ri.
He'll know.
Lawyer Seo will.
He'll definitely answer my call.
Lawyer Seo.

You know my name right?
I thought that Mom came to celebrate my birthday for me.
I finally know that 'like' and 'slowly liking' are different.
It looks like I'm making you uncomfortable.
You don't even let me know that you're tired.
Taking care of me.
Do you still remember the murder case fifteen years ago?

[Attorney Seo In Woo]
Episode 12
Let's meet, come to the break lounge.
Is something wrong?
Why were you so late?
I'm sorry.
I don't mean to censure you, it's just that you don't look very good.
Well, it's nothing.
There's nothing wrong.
Your father's case has already ended, is there something else bothering you?
No, there's nothing wrong.
Prosecutor Ma.
Well, I'm just... a little...
Some other time.
Alright.
Later on, when you feel like saying, and if you need help, tell me.
Alright.
What is Madam Han Jung Ran hiding?
What exactly did Go Man Chul exchange to get that piece of land?
Madam Han Jung Ran you know, don't you?
No,
I don't know anything about it.
After 9 pm,
I was drinking with Go Man Chul, a junior from my hometown.
For the murder case,
Dad's alibi, was provided by Go Man Chul and Han Jung Ran, a piece of land was given away, something must have been hidden...
Are you feeling sick, Prosecutor?
Well, yes.
I'm exhausted.
I'll read this at home.
I'm leaving now.
I'll be leaving work first today.
I see.
You're rather serious about exercising.
Sunbae, are you leaving now?
Yes, I haven't bought Bin's present yet.
You mustn't buy the same present as last year.
What did I get?
A doll set.
You bought the same thing the year before as well.
Ah, I did?
I'll become someone who puts you at ease.
I could just go my own way, but how can I leave you on your own when you botch up so many things?
So, I'll just become a friend who puts you at ease.
A friend's good, right?
Not bad, right?
Okay?
Okay.
Despicable fellow.
Where did he disappear to all of a sudden?
Private matters cannot be randomly told to anyone.
Private matters cannot be randomly told to anyone.
That's right,
Lawyer Seo and I have no ties between us.
Wake up, Ma Hye Ri, wake up.
Anyhow...
Lawyer Seo wouldn't do this to me.
Did something happen to Prosecutor Ma recently?
It seems so, but I don't know what.
She wouldn't tell me.
Maybe she doesn't feel at ease with me.
She doesn't tell me what's in her heart.
Prosecutor Jin, it's the same with you, right?
Who?
You think me too?
You don't think so?
When you were new in the office, you shared a lot with me.
When was that?
Was that my wife's friend or junior?
When we set-up you and that guy, was it after your third meeting?
You were totally drunk when you came to our place, you told my wife, when you were totally drunk, remember?
Stop that.
Unni, you already found the ideal guy I like.
When did I say that?
Why would you remember something like that?
Sunbae, really.
After that, when Bin's mom died, you started becoming like an adult.
What do you mean like an adult?
You never showed your suffering, but cared for others.
Why didn't you mention you were coming home?
What's up?
What's up?
Because I missed you, Mom.
Oh, suddenly, it feels like a hero's homecoming.
I must be extremely popular.
Why?
Other than me, who else likes you so much?
Who else?
Your dad.
Is he nice to you?
He didn't get angry, he just kept quiet.
That was right after the divorce paper ruckus.
Ah!
That's great.
Why are you looking around so curiously?
As if it's your first time here.
Mom,
Dad...
What kind of a man was he?
Mom, you and Dad got married out of love, right?
Loved to death.
Amongst all the men who were courting me, he was the best.
Manly, with a good appetite.
Mom, you don't know much about Dad's business, assets or things like that, right?
I don't, of course.
So long as I get the monthly living expenses on time, and I get to use credit cards and such.
My dad's not a bad person, is he?
Of course, it's only because there have been life changes.
In the past, he used to be so romantic.
But what is this ill-mannered stuff you're talking about?
"A bad person?"
How can you use such a crass term about your dad?
Ah!
How could I be so crass?
Oh!
Honey.
What brings you here?
Dad.
Haven't you been doing your facials?
Your skin doesn't look that good.
Ah!
Not as frequently as I used to.
She's too absorbed in her prosecutor job, so maybe she has no time.
You can have them come to your house, you know.
Get facials at home.
Alright.
Why?
Did something happen at the Prosecutor Office?
No, nothing special.
That's good then.
Dad, what about you?
Nothing happened to you, right?
I never knew this before, to live with nothing special happening, that's a very good thing.
Oh, why is this child speaking like an old person now?
She's mature now.
That's why they must get a job in society.
But it still makes me sad.
To make our Hye Ri so mature, it must have taken lots of difficult experiences.
This child used to be so naive and so pure.
And you're proud of that?
Yes, nothing will happen.
Don't be ill-at-ease.
It will be fine.
This is so great, better than sleeping with my husband.
It's been so long since I slept with you, Mom.
When you said you wanted to sleep with me like this, it really felt like you were going off to be married.
You told me to live at home even after marriage, that's why you built such a large house, right?
That was my dream at that time.
Oh!
It's not a dream now.
If you married Lawyer Seo, you can move back home.
Lawyer Seo?
Yes.
Isn't that right?
His father lives in America, right?
Mom, you know...
After you two get married, will your father-in-law come live in Korea?
That's not it.
Then?
Mom,
I think I'm truly in love with Lawyer Seo.
You mean you didn't like him that much before?
I did but,
I had no idea I liked him this much.
I liked him but, I didn't know I liked him so much.
Hye Ri.
Mom.
What's wrong?
Did you quarrel?
Lawyer Seo made you sad?
I miss him.
Here, Bin, eat up.
Happy Birthday.
Granny made lots of nice food for you.
And this is your present.
I don't want it.
Give it to me later.
Later, I can't be there, you know.
Birthday presents are to be given at the party, right?
Like last year.
Today, I have a really important appointment.
But every year at Bin's birthday, you always eat and party together, right?
Who are you meeting with?
A friend.
Which friend?
I have friends whom you don't know.
You have friends I don't know about?
Jung Seon, do you have another boyfriend?
What do you mean?
If that is not true, why would you be meeting someone else on Bin's birthday?
Don't presume you know all about your daughter now.
So you didn't go to view the cherry blossoms with Prosecutor Yoon?
No!
Then you went alone?
Going there alone...
It's not a place to go alone, you know.
So you went with a guy.
I knew it, I knew it.
Who was it?
Mom, I'm going to the bathroom;
I have a stomach ache.
Shin Jung Nam is the sole witness of that murder case.
According to that man's statement,
Dad is not the perpetrator.
Even if Dad did give a piece of land to Go Man Chul, there must be some other reason for that.
Hello.
Is the owner, Shin Jung Nam, here?
Yes, that's me.
Hello.
I came to ask you something.
Do you still remember from 15 years ago, about the murder case that happened?
You made a statement as an eye-witness in the case, didn't you?
Father, I forgot to get the flower pot.
Prosecutor!
Oh!
How are you?
I did hit someone but it was not to start a fight,
I did it to save a lady.
You're Shin Dong Ha, right?
During my investigation, she was the prosecutor.
Oh, I see.
Hello, Prosecutor.
I am the lawyer for defendant Shin Dong Ha.
I'm Lawyer Seo In Woo.
At that time, your lawyer was Lawyer Seo In Woo, correct?
Yes.
He found the evidence;
that's how Dong Ha got released.
Yes but, how did you appoint him for your son's case?
Did you know him from before?
He was a frequent customer who came weekly for flowers.
We didn't know he was a lawyer.
Flowers?
Not sure if it was for his parent's grave, or whose grave, for almost a year now, he comes every week.
Oh.
So how did he get appointed for the case?
From another earlier case, I found out he was a lawyer, so I asked for his help.
Ah!
But Prosecutor, why have you come to my house?
She's here for the bonsai.
Send that thing over quickly.
During my patrol, I saw a light in the trailer so I went to check it out.
So was that where you witnessed the murder case?
What I saw was after the murder took place.
A man was down;
I saw the perpetrator with his hands stained with blood.
Hello?
Someone's been killed over here.
The criminal was that man alright.
But my dad, why did he give land to the guy who provided an alibi for him?
Yes, Sunbaenim?
Sunbae Yoon's daughter is having her birthday?
Yes.
Maybe because recently you seem to be out of sorts, Prosecutor Ma, so Sunbae chose not to tell you.
But anyway I thought you should know about it, so I called.
I see.
Thank you.
At 6 pm, there's a birthday party at the pizza shop.
You know where that is, right?
Yes, I do.
Whether you go or not, you discuss it with Yoon sunbae.
That's all.
Who is the man in your heart?
If you're just playing around with Yoon sunbae, stop it.
Don't make him sad.
She's here after all.
Why isn't she going inside?
Why is she out?
Don't tell me Yoon sunbae's not here yet?
You know my name, right?
Should I know your name?
Don't you know me?
Who are you?
So why did you come here?
To apologize, and to congratulate.
How can you apologize and congratulate at the same time?
You think so?
Actually,
I'm here to congratulate, but I think I should apologize first.
To who?
To someone I like.
I just found out, to like and to fall for someone are two different things.
What are those two talking about?
Bin wasn't even surprised.
What?
Sunbae, I came here but...
I can't bring myself to go in.
I feel bad about Yoon sunbae,
I did something wrong towards him so...
Shut up right now.
Come out, turn right and keep walking.
Don't look back, just walk out naturally.
Ma Hye Ri.
I think I went crazy.
Yes, Sunbaenim?
Is it a very important appointment?
What?
If it's not a very important appointment, come and cheer up Bin.
Bin, can't you tell us why you're so sad?
Here, Bin.
A friend of mine and your dad's passed me this to give to you, she wanted to wish you Happy Birthday.
Who?
What is this?
It's a book reader.
It was someone who knew you loved to read.
Are there many books in here?
Wow, there are so many books here.
More than even a thousand.
Wow, Ahjumma, is this a present from my mom?
Just now, I saw someone who looked exactly like my mom.
Someone who looked exactly like your mom?
So sorry, Sunbaenim, I think I was out of line today.
The person Bin saw was Prosecutor Ma?
I was the one who told Prosecutor Ma about Bin's birthday.
Why?
It's just something I thought I should do.
Prosecutor Ma also tells me about the dates she goes with you.
I thought if it was Prosecutor Ma, sooner or later Bin would have to get to know her.
And I thought you had intended to invite Prosecutor Ma but hadn't.
Anyway, I was being too cavalier.
Being cavalier?
I'm even worse than you.
I thought I was the only one who noticed she looked like Bin's mom.
I felt sad and uncomfortable, but I'd feel amazed and happy too,
I was getting all confused.
I never considered how Bin would feel.
If we had told her earlier, things would have worked out better.
I still find him very handsome.
Anyone looking at you will think you've gone crazy, mumbling to yourself like that.
Sunbae, it's because you're too handsome as you walked over.
You wanted to see me to tell me I'm very handsome?
No.
Then?
I... those I like and those I dislike,
I'm someone who makes things very definite and clear.
Definite and clear are similar adjectives.
Yes.
But Sunbae, you're clearly very handsome, definitely so.
I really thought I had fallen for you...
I didn't want to explain all this;
these aren't the things I wanted to say.
Oh, how should I put it?
I was the one who first...
Stop it.
You don't have to explain, I understand.
You don't understand.
Even though it's all in your heart, but I knew the one you liked maybe wasn't me.
Have you eaten?
Why didn't you eat before you left?
Thank you.
Your present was well-received.
Bin likes it very much.
I thought if she's well-read, she wouldn't turn out like me.
And what's wrong with you?
Isn't my understanding sometimes limited?
When I look back the one who held out a hand was always me.
You just dreamed.
Why is it you can so easily say that there's no place for me for me in your dreams?
The sunshine that a drink can make you hope for is dazzling.
Tears that fall from being drunk are blinding.
Don't cry.
Don't cry.
I don't want to make you cry.
The sunshine that a drink can make you hope for is dazzling.
Tears that fall from being drunk are blinding.
Don't cry.
Don't cry.
All right, for you,
I will, I will if you say I must.
Hey, you need to put on some weight.
Sit down.
Drink this now.
It soothes your soul... a warm cocoa.
Why are you looking at me like this?
Are you crying?
Why are you looking at me like that?
So cheekily.
Why are you over there?
Because this is my house.
Goodbye, goodbye my princess.
I will let you go now.
Spread your wings and fly away as high as the sky.
Goodbye, goodbye my princess.
But, remember me, who has been there for you so long.
Goodbye.
The sunshine that a drink can make you hope for is dazzling.
Tears that fall from being drunk are blinding.
Don't cry.
Don't cry.
All right, for you
I will, I will if you say I must.
Goodbye, goodbye my princess.
I will let you go now.
Spread your wings and fly away as high as the sky.
Goodbye, goodbye my princess.
But, remember me, who has been there for you.
I love you, I love you my princess.
I will let you go.
Stretch your wings and fly away as high as the sky.
Goodbye, goodbye my love.
But, remember me, who's still waiting for you and love me.
Oh!
This.
Ma Hye Ri, wake up!
Ma Hye Ri!
You need to carpool!
Ma Hye Ri!
You need to go meet Prosecutor Yoon!
What are you looking at?
Go wash up!
It's Lawyer Seo!
It's Lawyer Seo!
Where have you been?
What happened?
Did something happen to you?
How can you be like that?
If you're going somewhere, you should say where you're going.
Why do I have to say those things?
Of course you have to say those things.
Do you know how long I've waited for you?
I had nobody to talk to; it was scary.
I was so anxious.
Where I'm going, what I'm doing... is our relationship such that I need to tell you?
What's wrong?
I know there's nothing going on between us, but...
Then that's that.
Let's go in, I'm tired.
Lawyer Seo.
What's up with him?
Yeah, I'm back.
Just now.
Really?
Good job.
Lawyer Seo, come on out.
Come on out.
I have something to say.
Hurry and open the door.
What?
Let's talk.
Let's just stop.
Are you coming out or shall I come in?
Why don't you come outside?
Why aren't you answering me?
Is your pride picking a fight with my pride?
Say what you want to say.
You have to answer for me to continue talking.
Stop asking me questions and asking for answers; it's annoying.
I didn't come out here to have a conversation with you.
I was dragged out by your stubbornness.
Stubbornness?
Are you saying I forced you?
You know what stubbornness is?
What you're doing right now is stubbornness.
Do you see me as some dog, pig, cow or sheep?
Is that why after leaving without a word, you come back and then...
"What are you?"
"A dog?
A pig?
A cow?
A sheep?"
"Why are you just hanging around, blocking the road?"
Is that what you're saying to me?
You said to contact you anytime.
I had some work to do, and because I had work to do, I had to go somewhere.
And so, I cleaned up the little details around me.
Are you saying I'm one of those "little details"?
You're really funny.
Can you just clean up your attachments to people as though you were sweeping them up with a broom?
I can.
So tacky.
What?
Using those kinds of cheap tactics to hurt someone...
It's not like you.
You're probably thinking I'm not the woman you'll end up with, and there's Prosecutor Yoon.
So, it seems you're just trying to clean up your feelings for a woman you have no chance with.
But you couldn't hate me that much.
You just couldn't do that.
You liked me enough to follow me to this place.
You don't think it's a misunderstanding?
I don't.
Because there's no other reason.
The world is not as simple as you think.
There aren't only the simple things your mind is capable of imagining.
However, none of that changes anything.
Lawyer Seo, you don't dislike me.
What's the real reason you're acting like this?
Stop messing around and stop right there.
You better not disappear again!
I'll kill you.
Hey, you said we were friends.
You even came when I told you not to.
And when I really needed you, you disappeared.
Ma Hye Ri.
You've never tasted my wrath;
don't even think about moving.
You make me sink so low, but I feel so much calmer now.
Now that I know you're there,
I feel relieved.
I really can't understand you.
Are you hungry?
Let's go out.
So why did you come back here?
I didn't feel like moving again.
It's been a while since you've been there so you should have jetlag.
Yeah.
Your parents really miss you.
We don't have birth parents anymore, but we do have our adoptive parents.
Ma Hye Ri seems to be having a tough time by herself.
Who can she talk to about her father?
Moreover, it involves a murder case too.
How much has she figured out?
Not much, give her more time.
I'm beginning to wonder if it'll remain buried forever.
That won't happen.
It concerns her father, you know.
"Once I figure out everything, then I'll decide how to proceed."
How can you be so sure?
Because I would do the same thing.
I wouldn't.
If it was me, I would pretend not to know and just live comfortably.
For the Han Ji Won case, we're summoning witnesses again, then we'll hand it over to the respective jurisdictions.
Alright, do that.
Prosecutor Ma, I have something to say.
Yes, go ahead, Chief.
You have a good memory, right?
I hear it's really good.
Then you will remember... we still don't trust you completely.
Yes, I told you that time as well.
It'd be a burden if you did trust me.
Okay good, we're on the same page.
You know what kind of character I hate the most?
- Someone who regresses.
- That's right.
Leaving work early, cases being delayed.
Have you exchanged your brain for a designer bag?
I thought you were getting better, but is the old Ma Hye Ri coming back?
Chief, these days, Prosecutor Ma...
You're only a teeny-weeny bit better than you were when you started out, it's not because of some amazing improvement I praised you, you know.
I'll improve my work.
Go on out.
Prosecutor Ma these days...
Prosecutor Ma these days, what?
What?
What?
Are you two in it together?
Why are you on her side?
I hate that.
- No, that's not it.
- That's not...
What is this?
You two are a set now, so Prosecutor Ma is the ugly duckling?
Is that why she's acting that way?
Sunbaenims...
Why?
Do I have something on my face?
Is my make-up flaking off?
Ah, yes.
It's hard to just ignore it.
Prosecutor Ma, just say it, what's going on?
You got pushed out of the trio?
I knew Prosecutor Jin had those skills.
Someone with your flamboyant style has no bite.
No, it's not like that.
Don't lose your faith to love and do something stupid.
Once it passes, it's all suffering.
That's...
There's nothing going on with me.
I haven't gotten a facial or gone to yoga in a month, so my bio-rhythm is off.
Why are you so down?
You know the Bureau Chief has a plan for everything, right?
Of course.
Should I teach you how to get back on the Bureau Chief's good side?
Have another house party.
Then I'll tell you.
You bring the kimchi.
Of course.
Deal.
Prosecutor Ma, be strong.
Fighting.
Here, eat.
Your conversation with Hye Ri, what was the outcome?
About what?
In this world, there are two kinds of people:
people observant, who know what to do, and people who, until asked, don't say anything.
I don't know what you're talking about.
There are projects that cause headaches, but I don't want to be the kind of father who holds on to his daughter by the collar.
I was just being patient.
So now, you're just relaxing?
Honey, what in the world are you talking about?
Hye Ri!
Hye Ri!
You said you would convince Hye Ri to get her own wedding plans moving forward.
We decided Hye Ri won't go on any match-making dates.
You said she didn't have to go.
Who?
Me?
Well... you... you... couldn't give up on me... so you...
- the divorce papers...
- Bring those divorce papers right now!
Totally useless, senseless wife.
I can't stand to look at you anymore!
Let's get them signed!
Fine!
Let's do it!
Getting rid of your useless wife and using your valuable daughter,
I don't want to be with that kind of man either.
Wha...
What did you just say?
I'm using my daughter?
You're totally using her.
Honey, you are exactly the same as Shim Chung's father who sold his daughter for 300 sacks of rice.
Hey, Park Ae Ja!
How dare you compare me to Shim Chung's father!
Using your daughters entirely for your gain, it's exactly the same.
Hey, Shim Chung, that guy...
Ma Hye Ri's father is... worse than Shim Chung's father.
At least Sim Chung's father was blind.
Ma Hye Ri's father is full of greed and using his daughter.
You...
Are you finished?
What is life?
What makes it special?
Being full and warm, feeling at ease...
Why are you so greedy?
Your daughter said she doesn't want that.
Why else would she have moved away?
Oh, Lawyer Seo!
Are you leaving for work now?
Is there something going on with you?
Or are you mad at me?
Have I done something wrong?
Tell me.
If I did something wrong, you have to tell me so I'll know.
Are you upset because I told you to move a while back?
Does Jenny not want us to be friends?
Did she say we shouldn't even acknowledge one another?
- Just stop!
- Oh, you scared me!
Just stop.
So... tell me why, all of a sudden... why are you treating me like this?
Tell me.
I did tell you.
I'm finished with you.
Well, whatever...
I never asked him to do anything.
Why all of a sudden... is he finished?
What do you want with a 15 year old case?
Ah, well, it's very similar to a case I have right now.
I want use it as a reference.
What are you curious about?
Just ask.
The records show that the culprit, Seo Dong Gun, denied the charges until the end.
He did.
But an eye witness... a motive for the crime...
the murder weapon... they're all there.
What's the sense in denying it?
Seo Dong Gun wasn't that kind of person.
Was he someone you knew very well?
When you live in the same neighborhood, you get to know each other well.
Ah, I see.
Since Seo Dong Gun's sentence was 15 years, he doesn't have much time left before his release.
What release?
He died while he was in prison.
He died in prison?
After their father died, the mother took her son and immigrated to U.S.
Oh, I don't know why I'm running around like this.
What do you think Lawyer Seo?
Am I being too suspicious?
I feel so anxious and I can't tell what's what.
Why do I want to keep digging?
Should I just quit?
You'll just tell me to dig wide and deep, right?
Oh, that scared me!
Yes, Dad.
You're in front of my house?
I heard from your mother that I'm totally using my daughter.
What?
Am I someone who would use his daughter for his own personal gain?
I'm doing this because it won't hurt you either.
It's not about hurting you.
Good family background, strong personal abilities, family assets and even money,
I picked someone specially who has all of that.
What's with all the dissatisfaction?
Did you get mad at Mom?
So you're the same as your mom?
That's not what I mean.
If I do it my way, you'll benefit as well.
That's what I'm pushing for this.
You came here to tell me this?
Even if you don't like it, even though it's my way of doing things,
it's because your father loves you.
Children... to love them, or not to love them, as parents there's no choice.
You just end up loving the child, no matter what.
That's why parents suffer.
And I hate the suffering more than anything, too.
So unfair.
Dad, you don't do anything bad, right?
Of course I do, why wouldn't I?
You said you didn't last time.
Doing something bad is defined differently by each person.
Especially to a man.
Dad, by chance...
I need to go.
Go out and get some dinner.
Yes.
Lawyer Seo.
Come out and have dinner with me.
I told you to stop doing this.
It's annoying.
I'm hungry.
I'm having a very, very difficult time.
And when I'm hungry, it's even more difficult.
Can you help me eat dinner?
It's like honey!
It's really good; hurry up and eat.
Why didn't I ever see it when I passed by?
It's really good.
It's hot.
Mmm, it's good.
How much meat is there here?
Why aren't you eating?
Excuse me!
Oh, this is strange.
My tolerance is usually very high.
Why is my body so tired after drinking these?
- Let's go.
- No, no, no!
Cancel!
Cancel!
I'm not tired!
- Let's go.
- Can't we just stay here?
We're finished eating.
Like in the past, stay...
Why can't you?
I'm having such a difficult time.
While you were gone,
I was so scared and so many scary things happened.
If you were going to be this way, why did you record your voice for my clock?
Why did you cook for me?
Why... did you appear?
Why?
Just stop it Hye Ri.
Don't continue.
Hello?
Hello?
May I bother you?
You can bother me.
Is this Go Man Chul's residence?
So?
Who's this?
This is the bank.
Go Man Chul has registered for an event, but his cell phone has changed.
Hey!
You're Han Jung Ran, right?
Hey!
Hey!
You're one voice I'll never forget.
Why those two... are they still meeting?
Those adulterers are still fighting against the institution of monogamy, aren't they?
They haven't broken up after 15 years?
How can she recognize my voice?
That housewife isn't someone to be trifled with.
I shouldn't have called the house.
You don't know where he works, don't have his cell phone number, of course you have to call his house.
Oh, how can I get in contact with Go Man Chul?
But, why are you throwing a fit because you can't reach him?
It's not because I like him.
There's something I need to ask him.
Go Man Chul, are you inside?
Go Man Chul!
Go Man Chul, are you inside?
Open the door please...
This is a different girl.
This time it's a wet behind the ears young...
Oh...
I'm here to investigate...
I'm Prosecutor Ma Hye Ri.
- Prosecutor?
- Yes.
This is Go Man Chul's residence, right?
I'm here because I have something to ask him.
Wait, wait.
Just come inside the house.
You want me to find Han Jung Ran?
That girl... 15 years ago, no is it 16 years?
Regardless, she is someone who had an affair with my husband.
I had no idea that they were still meeting.
I can't find someone for that reason.
That woman is a home-wrecker, Prosecutor!
So, does Go Man Chul have a cell phone?
He lost it while running away.
You think I'd buy him one?
You don't know where he is?
That other time, I should have had them locked away for the crime of adultery.
I was afraid of losing a pile of money.
So there's no way to get in contact with Go Man Chul?
So Prosecutor, if I want to put away someone for adultery, how do I do that?
You need to have proof of your husband's relationship with Han Jung Ran.
Proof?
Proof?
Proof.
A minute ago, you said something about 15 years ago.
By chance...
A while ago, you also mentioned something about a pile of money.
What did you mean?
I'll contact you.
So... that... that...
You can't hurry up?
The Rose...
Where is Han Jang Ran's business?
Wait!
Wait!
Wait!
Wait!
Wait!
Why did the prosecutor come here?
What did she ask you?
What did you tell her?
Why would I live with someone like you?
!
Why?
!
Why?
!
Why?
!
Why?
!
Why?
!
Honey, Honey, don't be like this.
Why did she come?
Tell me what you guys talked about.
You and Han Jung Ran have been meeting for 15 years.
- She came to give me a divorce!
A divorce!
- Wait!
Wait!
Was that for real?
What kind of prosecutor says those things?
What did you just say?
My Hye Ri is doing what?
Ma Sang Tae's daughter, Prosecutor Ma Hye Ri, is asking about the incident 15 years ago.
How?
Why?
Why?
Why are you asking me?
She's looking for Jung Ran, and coming to see my wife asking,
"How did you receive this property?"
"What are you keeping quiet about?"
She's asking things like that.
So what did she say?
Aigoo, Hyungnim, you sure live a complicated life.
What?
Why did you make your daughter a prosecutor?
Why you little...!
Even when it seems the sky is dark, the sun always comes out.
Shut up!
I better shut up.
I kept my mouth shut like this for 15 years.
I shut my mouth and you kept my mouth shut.
Didn't you?
Why is Hye Ri asking about that case?
How did she find out?
Hello?
Prosecutor!
It's Go Man Chul's wife.
Go Man Chul's wife...?
Ah!
Yes, yes.
How can I help you?
Can we still use this to charge them with adultery?
You came all this way for this?
You told me if there was anything from 15 years ago between Go Man Chul and Han Jung Ran to call you.
I did tell you, but, this is...
We can't charge them with adultery?
We can't charge them with adultery with these kinds of pictures.
But back then, I said I was going to use these for adultery charges, so he gave me a wad of money and begged.
Here!
The two of them going into a motel, then coming out; it's captured in a picture.
Going in was 9:55.
Coming out was 10:32.
During that time, Go Man Chul and Han Jung Ran were in a motel.
But then, Dad...
Between 9 and 12,
I was out drinking with Go Man Chul.
I called in the afternoon and said let's meet up.
At a bar called The Rose.
It was supposed to be closed that day, but since Man Chul oppa is a regular,
I opened the store for him.
The two of them going into a motel then coming out, it's captured in a picture.
Yoo Myung Woo's death was between 10 and 10:30.
During that time, Dad said he was drinking with Go Man Chul.
But Go Man Chul was with Han Jung Ran at a motel.
Dad's alibi is not true.
Dad gave Go Man Chul property for being his alibi.
No way, impossible.
Impossible.
- I'm going.
- Okay.
Lawyer Seo.
Why is Lawyer Seo coming out of there?
After selling store, I feel so good.
Excuse me.
Aigoo!
Prosecutor!
Hello!
Gong Soon Hee, right?
We meet again here.
Jung Ran is my friend.
Oh, I see.
How do you know her?
After I got your request, the illegal gambling.
She's the Prosecutor I helped.
So that investigation was you?
So then, Lawyer Seo, you know him as well?
Lawyer... what do you mean "lawyer"?
The man who just left a few minutes ago.
Ah, Writer Seo.
Writer?
He's not a lawyer?
He's not a lawyer, but a writer.
But because of the legwork, he lied and said he was a lawyer to meet you.
Right, Jung Ran?
He should be telling you directly.
There's no books published with his name, but he's writing a detective novel.
But Prosecutor, why do you keep coming here?
I really don't like it.
Lawyer Seo...
No...
I mean the person named Seo In Woo, how did you get to know him?
As a customer and he came like a little brother and worries about my well being.
Since when?
About 2 years.
He's a customer that comes once a week to buy flowers.
I didn't know he was a lawyer.
Shin Jung Nam, witness.
Han Jung Ran, Go Man Chul,
Dad's alibi.
The man who died in prison, Seo Dong Gun.
The son who went to America.
The lawyer who returned from America.
I went to America when I was in 6th grade.
After 4 months in America, mother died in a car accident.
I lived with my father.
Whatever my father said was all a promise.
It "was" a promise?
Why is it past tense?
He doesn't keep promises now?
I couldn't keep the promises.
I couldn't keep them.
Still...
Seo In Woo.

Brought to you by WITH S2 Written In The Heavens Subbing Squad
You're warm.
You're Lawyer Seo.
That's right.
I'm me.
What's right?
What's right?
Is it right that you knew who I was right from the start?
Is it right that you appeared in front of me on purpose?
Is it true that you used me?
Probably?
Definitely.
You're someone who doesn't see anything once you start something, and you'll only be satisfied after you finish.
Like you thought, she went to get her skis first.
When you get the money, call me.
You're not going to check my identity?
What are you going to do if I don't call?
Oh my god.
Moving also?
What you're thinking is all right.
What is?
What is?
What is?
What am I thinking?
What am I thinking that you can say that it's true?
Give me your keys.
Kids these days, this is the problem.
This is.
Episode 13
You can't say anything bad to them.
They grew up too lovingly.
China has that problem too.
China does.
'Little Emperor'
They only have one child and the child is treated as a king.
It's actually a social problem in China.
No matter how immature she is, do you think she did this because you got angry with her?
Then, why is she absent without notice?
She could be sick or something.
Where is she sick that she doesn't answer the phone?
Is this a school?
Maybe she's really sick?
Should I contact Prosecutor Ma's home?
Home?
Oh!
No!
Definitely not!
Why?
Don't you remember when you were going to school?
You didn't go to school pretending to be sick, but the teacher would call because she was worried.
And then father's explosive anger, and mother's young tears.
Don't call her house.
No.
You said you were sick and missed school.
I did that too.
Maybe chief and I are soulmates?
Nothing is the answer.
She doesn't know that I did it for her.
Man.
Keep calling her.
Call.
Until she picks up.
Oh, Prosecutor Jin.
I guess something is up with Prosecutor Ma.
I guess so.
Should I send a message-
Oh, Sunbae you do it.
What is this?
[Missed calls- 7]
What do you know about Seo In Woo?
I don't think he's someone who will be good to you just because you're his friend.
[Dad]
I'm home right now.
Home?
You mean that house?
Yeah.
Why are you there?
You went to meet Ma Hye Ri before.
I met her and I came in.
Why?
It just happened.
Then, you're not coming out today?
Probably.
All right.
Why?
Is something wrong?
No, I was just curious.
Are you having a hard time?
Is she?
Let's talk tomorrow.
All right.
I'll see you tomorrow morning.
Are you not coming out or is it because you can't come?
Get your act together!
Get your head on right.
Hye Ri... is doing all right, right?
Are you unable to contact her?
Why are you asking me about her?
Have you called her?
No, I haven't.
Why?
She told me not to.
What?
To you?
She told you not to call?
Why?
It's because she doesn't like her dad who booted her, and me who became like this because of you.
Park Ae Ja, what are you talking about?
What I'm saying is that she doesn't like you, any man like you, and due to you- stop playing with words.
Just answer my questions.
Did you hear anything from Hye Ri?
Is there anything going on with her?
You went to her house without my knowledge.
Man!
Is there anything wrong with her?
Yes or no?
Is something wrong with her?
God, I'm frustrated.
That's why your daughter isn't speaking to you either.
Find out if there's anything wrong with her.
If something is wrong with her at this age, it can only be a man.
First find out if she's okay!
Stop pretending that you're watching over the country like that.
I know everything, but what else is there to find out?
If I find out that you were hiding something from me-
Ask for a divorce or something.
I had something to consult you about.
That's why I called you.
Yes.
Earlier, I went to a meeting.
A friend wants to introduce you to her cousin's daughter-
Oh!
I heard you call it 'blind date' these days.
Blind date?
Prosecutor Yoon, a blind date is okay, right?
She's 32 and a pharmacist.
Well, I'm not...
I'm not interested yet.
Jung Seon, you know the sauna at the junction?
She works at the pharmacy in the building next to it.
Go have a look.
Why do I have to look at a woman that Sunbae is going to meet?
A woman knows a woman best, and a man knows a man best.
But have you by any chance seen her boyfriend?
Mom!
What are you talking about?
Boyfriend?
What?
You went to see the cherry blossoms together and on Bin's birthday, you were going to see that man, so you couldn't spend her birthday with her.
You have a boyfriend.
I'm curious as to what kind of person he is, but I know my daughter's slow temper, so I'm waiting.
Ah, I see.
Mom!
Stop, stop!
Really!
Why is she embarrassed at this age?
You're hot?
Sunbae?
To cool off, let's take a walk.
For a walk?
I want to go to Prosecutor Ma's house.
It's weird that she didn't show up for work without notice, and we can't reach her.
If she lived far it'd be one thing, but we're in the same neighborhood.
Sunbae, you go by yourself.
Aren't you worried about her?
You're her Sunbae.
But that... that isn't it.
Let's go.
This isn't her house.
Call her.
You said you were going to her house.
How can I go to a hoobae's house without contacting them first this late at night?
If something is wrong, if she's sick, if she needs our help, tell her to tell us.
You want me to call?
Then, should I?
Okay.
I understand.
Even if it's late, call me if you need anything.
Okay.
Is she really sick?
She said that she won't be able to come in for 2-3 days.
That's worrisome.
Sit.
If you were going to do this, we could have called from home.
Why did we come all the way here?
Are you that mortified that you came all the way here with me?
What?
!
No, that's not it.
That's not it...
Seeing Ma Hye Ri was uncomfortable and amazing.
She looked so similar to my wife, but their personalities were so different.
If Bin's mom was like Prosecutor Ma, she wouldn't have gotten cancer.
Won Ji became a mom at such a young age, so she couldn't enough her youth.
I had a lot of these thoughts.
I know.
You know?
Yes.
I know what you're feeling.
Because I'm someone who has a lot to be sorry for towards my wife,
I never dreamed of approaching another person first.
Did you know that too?
Of course.
Approaching someone first is not easy.
The fact that I was attracted to Prosecutor Ma...
Yes.
I feel like she sent me someone who looks like her to let her go;
to get my act together and look around.
What do you think about that?
Up to that...
I don't know since that's not my business.
Unni sent Prosecutor Ma, who looks like her, asking you to let her go.
It's hard.
Prosecutor Ma is someone who helped me understand that we weren't real to each other but we were just passing our time.
And through that I was able to see what was real.
Sunbae, since when were you so philosophical?
Prosecutor Ma and I decided to become Sunbae-Hoobae again.
Oh, that- that's what you meant to say.
I thought it was only her, but you both decided to do that.
Man, the future is grim.
You remember these pictures, right?
And what the date and time means.
When were these pictures taken?
Man, you're so inflexible.
Let me see.
I'm not sure.
Go Man Chul, why did you lie about being at the bar at this time?
Let me take a closer look.
Man, really.
Prosecutor, I don't know who your parents are, but do they know that you're acting like this?
If they raised you so well, you should think about them too!
Why are you wandering around like this!
You made an alibi for Ma Sang Tae, right?
And you received land for it.
The pictures have the exact time stamp on them, so don't even think about lying.
Why does it matter if I lie or not?
This isn't the prosecutor's office.
I don't know what this is, but if you're curious about this, get a warrant.
Or was it reference request?
Oh, it is reference request.
Oh!
What do I do?
The picture!
What do I do?
It's here.
I found it.
Hey!
Stop right there!
What?
What is it?
What...
Did you say right now?
15 years ago, May 20, 1995 at 9:55pm you went into a motel with Go Man Chul, right?
And you came out at 10:32.
Right?
What are you doing right now?
Then in order to make an alibi for President Ma Sang Tae, you went to the bar, Rose, right?
Look here-
And you told the police that you were at that bar from 9:30 onwards.
I don't know why you're acting this way, but bring me evidence!
The evidence, actually,
is inside you, Han Jung Ran.
What is that?
It's my bag.
Why is your bag...
Now that I look, you don't have a bag.
Inside here, is the evidence.
It's here.
You said he was Writer Seo, right?
That person
What kind of person was he?
[Han Jung Ran]
This is Seo In Woo.
In front of your store.
I'll go right now.
Writer Seo!
Wow!
Since you dress like this, that prosecutor really thought you were a lawyer.
Sister.
Did something happen with you two?
She keeps asking about you, but how should I say this.
I was in a pretty complicated situation-
I'm not a writer, sister.
What are you talking about?
I'm sorry.
I'm very sorry.
I can't say that to you.
I tricked you from the start.
I'm exhausted, writer.
But I am Seo In Woo.
How can you live like that as a person?
I'm sorry.
I get it.
Go.
Someone took the bag, no the pictures.
Something is going on.
Someone is by Hye Ri.
Yes, President?
Last time, that bracelet... did it suit Prosecutor Yoon?
Did he like it?
I didn't give it to Yoon sunbae.
Then, who did you give it to?
Did you give it to that weird lawyer?
Seo In Woo?
I have to take this one too.
I see you often.
Omo!
Welcome!
Do you know my friend?
Hye Ri, how do you-
How do you know her?
She's a VIP customer.
Last time, she introduced me to the Gioberni invitations and the hotel.
Gioberni?
Why are you there?
Because this is my room.
There's a record of you calling and canceling in your name.
I sent you a message that I couldn't go.
You can't come?
!
Do you want to use this together?
Weren't you waiting for your girlfriend?
I'm waiting for a woman.
You were in on this together?
Hye Ri, why are you acting like this?
Let us talk.
It's not like we're fighting on sides, so saying it that way is a bit awkward.
You two were on the same side, and made me into a fool.
Seems like you're angry.
Of course I am.
Didn't you hear it from In Woo yesterday?
You met.
He said he'd tell you everything.
In Woo did.
He didn't say that you two played around with me.
Do you expect an apology?
I don't need anything like that from you people.
Nor do I plan on apologizing.
I don't want to.
That bag you just picked out, worth a couple thousand, your brand name things...
Do you know that those are the things that you got from ruining In Woo's life?
You took it all away from In Woo.
I understand that you're shocked,
From all the Korean phrases, there is a good one:
"Put yourself in my shoes."
Now, why don't you try to see this from In Woo's point of view?
In Woo, in order to return to this country, worked hard in America for 15 years.
Hey, Lawyer Seo.
I'll call you later.
Thank you for getting my bag back for me.
You figured it out quickly.
My mom said I should never be in someone else's debt, so as thanks, let's have a cup of tea.
Do you want to come down, or should I go up?
I'll go up.
Is the sunlight better here?
This is what my terrace looks like.
I can see everything from here.
Sit.
You probably came because you have something to say.
You must have a lot of money.
I heard someone was living here.
I heard you used a lot of money to get into this house.
In order to get close to me, you used a lot of money, and treated me that well?
Yeah.
You are really incredible.
Did you study how to move people or did you read a book on 100 ways to treat a woman well?
It seemed real... but it was fake.
Like it was real, how can you act so well?
You made me food and carried me, you showed up when I needed you, when I was having a hard time, you found out things for me first, when I was scared you stayed with me.
It must have been hard to pretend to like me when you didn't.
Why didn't you just say something instead?
You could have asked me.
If I could have done that, I should have.
Yeah...
You should have.
What do you want from me?
To clear my father's name.
What?
Even though he wasn't a murderer, he died as one.
The title of "murderer", I want to clear it for him.
Wow!
Here I go.
Here.
I'm going.
There's no holding.
Goal!
My husband is the best!
Son, you have to work harder!
It's because I'm not wearing cleats!
Is that so?
Then, let's go buy cleats and go at it again.
Okay.
All right, I'll buy you new cleats.
Honey, welcome back.
Dad!
You came back?
Why are you empty-handed?
In Woo's cleats?
Aigoo.
I was so busy with work.
I'll be right back.
Don't sleep and wait up for me!
Hurry back.
Hello?
Hold on a moment.
Honey.
Phone.
Yes, hello.
Representative Yoo.
What?
You're going to meet the president?
Representative Yoo, did you drink by any chance?
Hel-
I'll be right back.
Representative Yoo!
Representative Yoo.
Let me see your face, In Woo.
You stopped exercising because I'm not there, right?
Seo In Woo, you're too pale.
You're a boy.
In Woo!
I'm not a murderer.
I did not kill a person.
Absolutely not.
Your dad isn't a murderer.
It's not because of that.
It's because I might cry.
All right.
That's a relief.
I thought it was because you hated me.
I know it wasn't you.
I'll get you out of there.
I'll clear your name.
Wait a bit.
All right.
You will?
I will.
I definitely will.
My father received that call on his way out to buy me cleats.
A call that your father and Yoo Myung Woo were meeting.
But your father said that he didn't go to the meeting.
So I knew...
That your father was the criminal.
Yoo Myung Woo wanted to meet because of a problem with the negotiation, but the person in charge was Director Seo, so I sent him instead.
You came because of who?
Seo Dong Gun.
I'm Seo Dong Gun's son.
Please save my father.
He didn't kill anyone.
You know that.
How do I know that?
You know that.
It's not my father.
Really!
Don't come to such a harsh place and act ridiculous!
Leave!
Ahjussi!
Ahjussi!
President!
Ahjussi!
President!
I did all that... but my father didn't wait.
There was nothing we could do because he had had a heart attack.
Dad.
Honey!
Dad!
Honey!
No, you can't do this.
Dad!
Dad, get up!
Dad!
Dad!
Dad, wake up!
Dad!
Dad!
Father, you can't do this.
You said you'd wait.
You have to wait 'til I get you out.
How could you do this?
I promised myself then that I'd definitely clear my father's name.
I said I don't want to.
In Woo.
If we leave,
Father is left alone.
He's dead.
A dead person doesn't matter.
Do you want to see me die too?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, In Woo.
I'm sorry for saying this, but I don't like this country.
I don't like it because it reminds me of your father, and I don't like it for making your father like that.
Let's go, okay?
Come on.
Hurry up.
No time.
It was always the same, but that day,
I was more lonely then usual and more scared,
so I shouldn't have gone out.
Mom!
Mom!
Mom, get up!
Mom!
Mom!
Mom, get up!
Mom!
It must have been so hard.
Lawyer Seo, you must have gone through a lot of suffering,
so...
So, you wanted to get back at my dad.
You wanted to get revenge like this.
What do you mean revenge?
That's not it.
I told you.
All I want to do is clear my father's name.
You used me, but it's not revenge?
I thought it'd be fun.
Fun?
As soon as I passed the bar when I got to Korea,
I started to investigate Yoo Myung Woo's case.
I found Ma Sang Tae and the others involved in the case.
I was finishing my investigation, and his daughter was studying for the bar, but she chose to be a prosecutor.
It was funny.
Ma Sang Tae's daughter is a prosecutor?
This will be fun.
I looked into what kind of person you were.
You're naive and very curious, but you are very trustful.
If she does well, she'll be the suitable person for this.
So, you needed me?
It's my dad.
He's my dad.
Did you think I'd continue after I found out?
Why can't you?
You're a prosecutor.
Did I tell you to hurt your father?
My father...
I'm telling you to clear his name.
Lawyer Seo, you're making a daughter investigate her father.
That's not revenge?
If you're a prosecutor, there's no problem.
Just change the order of who you are and think.
Your father is not first, you're clearing an innocent person's name.
That's it.
Let me ask you one thing.
Me...
Aren't you sorry at all?
You were doing that...
Acting like you liked me,
Acting like you were worried about me.
You treated me like this... to make sure I got my dad's case...
Weren't you sorry?
If someone starts knowing he'll be sorry,
He's not sorry at all.
Not once?
If someone was sorry, he'd never do this.
Do you have any other questions?
No matter what you say, the evidence as long as there is no real evidence, I
trust my dad.
Of course.
Since there is no real evidence.
Everything left until now is not evidence, and without evidence, you can't make someone guilty.
You're great.
Now I... what should I start with first?
Go Man Chul says it's not and Han Jung Ran doesn't say anything,
the appeal, Dad...
When I looked back you held out your hand.
It was always me.
You just dreamed.
Why in your dreams about me
You say so easily that there is no place for me.
I don't want to see a ray of sunshine from expectations of a drink.
I don't want to see tears dropping from the effects of alcohol.
Don't cry.
Don't cry.
I don't want to make you cry.
I don't want to see a ray of sunshine from expectations of a drink.
I don't want to see tears dropping from the effects of alcohol.
Don't cry.
Don't cry.
That's right, it's for your benefit.
Do you know who Seo In Woo is by any chance?
Seo In Woo?
What kind of person is he?
He's a lawyer.
Lawyer?
But he's the one who's next to Hye Ri?
Since it was only a short time, I couldn't find out in more detail, besides him, there seems to be no one else in your daughter's vicinity.
If he's a lawyer, did you find out where he graduated from, where he's from, who his parents are?
Strangely, he's American, but he took the Korean bar, and his parents passed away,
but...
Look at this.
It's only this?
What did his father do?
Seo Dong Gun?
[Han Jung Ran]
Yes, It's Prosecutor Ma Hye Ri.
It's Han Jung Ran.
I called you because I have something to tell you.
Hello.
I came to see Lawyer Seo In Woo.
Tell him Ma Sang Tae is here.
Call him.
Well, the pictures you showed me that day from May 20, 1995, 9:55 pm...
It's true that I went into the motel with Go Man Chul.
It's true?
And we came out around 10:30 because Man Chul oppa got a call from Ma Sang Tae.
What kind of call from Ma Sang Tae?
I didn't answer myself,
Go Man Chul picked up.
Sang Tae hyung?
Oh, put your clothes on quickly.
We have to go.
Why?
What's wrong?
We were resting that day, but I did as I was told and went in first through the front doors
Go inside.
Go inside.
and opened the back door.
And President Ma Sang Tae came in too.
That was a little after 11, but Man Chul oppa said that they had been drinking since 9, so I told them that at the police station.
I'm Ma Sang Tae.
You're later than I thought,
President Ma Sang Tae.
Are you not feeling well?
No, but...
Why are you suddenly telling me... on your own?
Lawyer Seo In Woo asked me.
What do you mean?
Writer Seo, I mean...
Lawyer Seo In Woo... told me why he lied to me and approached me.
After I listened to his past, I understood, and I thought that I had to tell you.
For Seo In Woo, you're telling the truth?
I don't know if he had a motive when he approached me, but during the last two years, I got a lot of help from him.
He gave me a lot of advice and listened to my grievances.
During the time he was with me, he was genuine.
Seo In Woo, you trust him?
Even a moment of honesty... is still honesty.
Seo Dong Gun has a strong son.
What do you mean one son?
For someone who ruined my father's life, you don't have the right to say that.
I'll take back what I just said.
You're not that strong of a son.
Did you come here to see how well I grew up?
Because you overcame such a hard situation and became a lawyer, I said you were strong.
But being unable to get over the feeling of being victimized, you're not strong.
You have gotten old.
Not knowing if you're causing harm to the other, not knowing if you're competent, now I see that you can't hide what you want to say.
There are requirements for talking as well.
It's because you're acting hastily.
I heard that you're bringing back your father's case, one that's been long closed.
I understand a prosecutor is investigating right now.
Investigating?
A lawyer should use legitimate ways.
Using my daughter in an investigation?
Do you have any evidence to prove that I used your daughter?
Well, even though you don't have evidence that I used your daughter, it's not like I didn't use Hye Ri.
Stop playing around.
What's the reason you're recklessly opening a closed case?
Do you think something is going to come out?
Even though you're this confident, you're not going to tell your daughter that you met me.
The fact that you met me alone is accepting your guilt.
What nonsense!
You're underestimating your daughter.
I fully... believe in Prosecutor Ma Hye Ri's capability.
[Hye Ri]
Yes.
Dad, where are you?
Are you at the office?
Come home.
I couldn't say what happened at that time which is why I used Go Man Chul as an alibi.
People all lie because they have no other choice.
Dad, if you really have nothing to do with the case, then it won't matter if I investigate.
I'm telling you nothing will come out even if you investigate.
Remember what I said about the faulty construction,
I was right.
Just by reopening the case, my image will be tainted, so why are you doing that?
I want to know the truth.
I have to know.
Why?
Why about a 15 year old case?
Why do you want to know?
Why do you need to know?
If there was something that could have been found then, why didn't they find it then?
Exactly!
If there is something...
If they didn't, why they couldn't.
Don't do anything unnecessary and close it.
I can't do that.
If you're going to be stubborn and act like this, give up being a prosecutor and come back home!
You want me to stop... being a prosecutor?
You said it didn't suit you.
Dad.
That house,
I'm going to put it on the market tomorrow, so pack your things and come back in.
Same goes for your car and cards.
Stop trying to scare me.
Even if you drag me home and lock me inside, even if you burn all my bags, clothes, and shoes,
I'm not Hye Ri, who used to be scared of you.
What?
I really need to use the bathroom, so-
But, what's wrong with both of your faces?
Did you fight?
What's wrong?
What did you talk about after chasing me out of the house?
It's nothing.
I'll... be going now.
That bag you just picked out, worth a couple thousand
Your brand name things.
Do you know that those are the things that you got from ruining In Woo's life?
Don't do anything unnecessary and close it.
If you're going to act like this, while acting like you liked me and worried about me,
you're going to...
You made my dad's case come to me.
Weren't you sorry?
If someone starts knowing he'll be sorry,
He's not sorry at all.
Ma Hye Ri wake up!
Ma Hye Ri.
Lawyer Seo,
Han Jung Ran said the alibi was not real, so Dad doesn't have an alibi anymore, but that's nothing in terms of the law.
Of course dad got angry.
What should I do, Lawyer Seo?
Bastard.
I'm the one who is crazy.
I might as well talk to the wall.
Ma Hye Ri!
You have to go meet Prosecutor Yoon!
Seo In Woo, you're really a bad guy.
Why did you do this for me?
Isn't there a way to erase this?
How do I do this?
Ma Hye Ri.
Oh my god.
How old are you now?
Oh my god.
Where are you living now?
No, where do you live now?
What is this?
I'm the one who followed you and moved here, the terrace house.
It's really nice here.
What is it?
In this nice place,
I'm waiting for your painful time to come.
When I'm with you, it's fun and moving, but you don't even know that you're part of my plan, and though I'm regretting bringing you into this, even though I know you're going to get hurt,
I have to hurt you.
In the end, I won't stop.
So...
I won't be able to say sorry.
Well, if you need me to do something, call me.
I'll be waiting.
Okay.
Hye Ri, don't just eat grass and live long,
healthily.
I hope you meet someone who loves you, someone who loves you so much that he'll make you forget the pain I gave you
and be happy, so I'll be less sorry.
I hope you who are listening to this is 77 years old.
Just like in the movie Titanic, you're with your loving daughter, or your daughter's daughter and you're telling them about when you were young.
When you were very naive and pretty, your life was hell
because of an awful man.
But even though he did that to me,
I lived very well.
I hope you'll laugh and curse me
when you hear this.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I know how much fear you have.
Are you okay?
What were you doing that you're like this?
It was the truth, but you accepted it just like that?
I'll go stand at the site of the accident, you come, okay?
No!
I... was blown off.
You're quite magnificent.
After waiting four hours for a man, you finally understand "suffering for love"?
This isn't going to work.
Get out.
Why?
I-I have to do this.
If you do this incorrectly, I'm worried you'll get hurt.
Go over there.
You could have just thrown it out.
Erase the recording for me.
Just throw it out.
If you gave it to me, you have no right to tell me to throw it out.
Then, erase it on your own.
Don't you think I wanted to?
Wait a bit.
Let me go in.
Stay right there.
Are you that scared of me?
Are you scared that I'm going to eat you if I go in?
When you disappeared, do you know how much I looked for you?
Is that so?
Do you know where I went to look for you?
I heard you came to the office.
Do you know why I went looking for you?
I haven't thought about it.
Liar.
Stay right there.
Seo In Woo, why are you so scared of me?
Why do you fear me?
-Stop messing...
-It's because you're sorry, right?
That's why you ran away, right?
You hid because you were too scared to see my face, right?
You were sorry, but you couldn't say sorry, so you were hurt,
and... then you were worried about me, that's why you came back, right?
If you're going to spew nonsense, go.
When I was having the hardest time, I thought of you.
Words that I couldn't ever say to anyone I kept in my heart and I wanted to die because it was so hard.
I wanted to say them to you.
I had to.
But you disappeared.
The person I came to trust the most in the world disappeared.
Stop!
Are you crazy?
I don't like you!
It's over.
I told you to get your act together.
Do you want to even say that to me?
Yeah.
I do.
Do you think this is the only thing I want to say to you?
There's so much more I want to say to you.
Ma Hye Ri, why are you doing this?
You, who drove me crazy,
I love you.
You bastard.
Did you not understand?
Do you want me to say it again?
Don't.
Don't.
I love you.
You bastard.
So, even if you hit me, tell me you're sorry.
Tell me right now.
I can't live until I'm 77.
From all the stress you've given me,
I'm going to get cancer.
How am I going to live until I'm 77?
The man I love, I can't see again.
The hurt you've caused me is too great.
The scar is too disgusting, so no one is going to love me.
So...
So, tell me you're sorry.
I can live if you do.
Even if I hurt, I'm the one who's hurt, so saying everything was fake, don't say that, okay?
Lawyer Seo,
tell me you're sorry.
Please tell me you're sorry.
Tell me now...
That you're sorry.

Don't be obvious.
Don't be scared.
Seo In Woo...
He's the guy that Hye Ri really likes.
Get in.
Let's car pool again.
Everything started because of this.
It's been a while, right?
What do you want from me?
What do you think it is?
Brought to you by WITH S2 Written In The Heavens Subbing Squad
Even if it hurts, I'll handle the hurt, so don't say that it was all fake, all a lie, okay?
Lawyer Seo.
Tell me you felt bad about it.
Tell me you're sorry.
Tell me now.
That you're sorry.
Goodbye, goodbye my princess.
I will let you go now.
Stretch your wings and fly away as high as the sky.
Goodbye, goodbye my princess.
But, remember me, who has been there for you.
Goodbye.
When I look back, the one who held out a hand was always me.
You just dreamed.
How much harder for you do you want to let it get?
It would be easier if you hated me.
Finally,
I feel like I can breathe again.
That's enough for me.
Thank goodness, that you like your adoptive father.
Really, thank goodness.
Thank goodness.
I remember.
Your face has gotten more handsome.
And, you've gotten a lot taller.
It wasn't my father!
It really wasn't!
Don't make a ruckus at the wrong place and go home, kid!
Ahjussi.
Ahjussi.
President Ahjussi!
Ahjussi!
President Ahjussi!
My mom just made them so they're really tasty and warm.
Eat.
If you starve, you'll die.
I don't need it.
- They're really tasty if you eat them with banana milk.
- I'm not eating it!
Thank goodness.
And you're ill-natured like you were back then.
And, even back then you were a total softy.
While you keep asking Hye Ri if something is wrong, if there was something wrong with Hey Ri and I didn't tell you, and if something happened to her while you didn't know,
I don't think you'd let me off and so, I thought about it all day yesterday ...
You're making me dizzy.
Put it simply and just tell me.
What is it?
Hye Ri ... has a man.
Hye Ri has a man?
That ...
I already told you last time, for certain, his name, his occupation, his personality, his body condition,
No, I didn't tell you his body condition, but I told you everything else.
You just didn't hear me!
When?
Who is it?
Frankly, I just don't understand.
Why say that you didn't hear any of the things I told you that day,
I just really, really don't understand.
I'm asking you who it is?
!
His name is Seo In Woo.
Seo In Woo?
Our Hye Ri really likes him.
He's a lawyer.
Hye Ri ... really what?
Hello.
What are you here for?
I guess you're not really pleased to see me.
So you didn't actually witness Seo Dong Gun murder Yoo Myung Woo?
No, I didn't.
Then, why did you speak in a way that made it sound so definite?
When did I?
When did you start this nursery business?
After the Yoo Myung Woo murder case, you quit your job as security guard for Jin Ri Construction, correct?
Prosecutor... why, exactly, are you asking me these things?
My name is Ma Hye Ri.
You don't think I know that?
Ma Sang Tae ...
I'm his daughter.
Ma Sang Tae?
And Lawyer Seo In Woo is Seo Dong Gun's ... son.
Let me tell you once more.
I'm Ma Sang Tae's daughter.
And Seo In Woo is Seo Dong Gun's son.
Why Ma Sang Tae's daughter keeps coming to see you, why Seo Dong Gun's son has been at your side,
think carefully about it, and ... and then, call me.
Ah, Prosecutor.
Lawyer Seo In Woo is Seo Dong Gun's son?
What kind of ...
What I can tell you is that there is definitely something that's been hidden about that case, and that you know what it is, and based on you, something can be changed.
But, I really don't know what you're talking about ...
Seo Dong Gun's son?
You came?
- It's been a while, hasn't it?
- Yes.
No way.
It's been a while, hasn't it?
Why are you so startled?
No, well um ...
Let's see.
Let's see how today's freesias look.
Did I mention where I take these freesias every week?
Um, Lawyer ...
Usually it's women who like freesias.
But my father worked in construction, and he liked this flower.
Is that why he was so sentimental?
Lawyer.
His name was Seo-Dong-Gun.
Do you know him, by any chance?
Wh-what is it you want from me?
What do you think it could be?
As life goes on, there will be a time when I need your help.
What could a man like you need my help for?
If I did, would you help?
Ah, of course.
I give you my word, with my son as witness.
Just say the word.
Hye Ri ... has a man.
She likes him so much, she even cried buckets because she missed him.
Just because there is no evidence that I used your daughter, it doesn't necessarily mean I didn't use Hye Ri.
That's what it was?
It was our Hye Ri?
[President Ma Sang Tae]
This is Seo In Woo.
Where are you right now?
If you're at your office, I'll come over.
I don't think we have the sort of relationship where I'll meet you whenever you want.
Aren't you a lawyer that gives clients top priority?
It you want to meet with me as a lawyer, I should come and see you.
Where are you?
Please sit.
Let's sit.
What's your relationship with our Hye Ri?
What is it?
Was that what it was?
You talk about investigating a 15 year old case, about clearing your father's name and what not, but ultimately, seducing my daughter to take revenge on me was your goal?
Right, I thought it was strange.
After all, it's a case that could never get anywhere after all this time.
What have you done to our Hye Ri?
!
President Ma,
I think you've misunderstood something, but in front of me, don't try to act like a virtuous father defending his daughter.
What?
Before you get angry worrying about your daughter, doesn't an apology come first?
If there's something you want to do with me, use the law to do it.
So, there's no way I'll find any evidence that proves you killed Yoo Myung Woo.
I see you're sure of that.
I have nothing to say to you about that case.
But,
I guess you have a lot to say to me about Ma Hye Ri.
With the time you're spending with me, why don't you convince your daughter?
"That bastard Seo In Woo is just stepping on you to get his revenge on me."
You tell Hye Ri yourself.
What?
You're determined, aren't you?
Are you saying that you could never admit to your daughter that you're a murderer?
After making my father a murderer to the entire world?
Don't talk without any proof!
You really want to bury the past that much?
Then, you keep the past.
I'll have your daughter.
What?
You punk!
If you don't like that, then give me back my past.
Pick one of the two.
You can't have both.
Hello.
Sunbaenim (senior)
Let's go.
Let's carpool again.
What?
I need to go workout.
I heard you joined, but don't go very often at all.
Well, I'm planning to go more often.
Why take two cars in a country that doesn't produce a drop of oil?
Mine's a compact car and doesn't use much gas.
Right, you used to be like this.
- You talked back a lot.
- Excuse me?
Don't let it show.
Don't be afraid.
Oh, yeah.
I almost forgot it.
Yes, hello.
Ah, hello.
Ah, I've come in.
Ah, Sunbaenim, good morning.
- Oh, are you all right?
- Yes!
Good Morning.
- Prosecutor!
- Prosecutor!
Isn't "Good Morning" something you say when you haven't seen each other in a while?
Please sit.
Without you in the office, it was so cold and lonely.
I thought icicles were going to form.
I'm grateful for such a warm welcome.
I'm going to review how the investigations have been going.
They say that if you're in, they'll start the meeting now.
Okay.
He was working part-time delivering for the cleaners, when he hit a foreign car with his scooter.
He said he ran because he didn't have the money to repair the car.
It turns out he's on welfare.
Aigoo, geez.
Then, just file it as a fined misdemeanor.
Yes, that's what I had planned.
But, what are these two gentlemen doing?
Don't you have anything to report?
Excuse me?
Do you have anything to report?
Excuse me?
Ah, not yet ...
We all just came into work so there aren't any cases we've dealt with.
Prosecutor Ma.
Why'd you use your valuable vacation days, hmm?
Don't you know the benefit of being in civil service?
Even if you're absent without notice, it's hard to be fired.
Hey, Prosecutor Choi Ji Woon, do you want to go to the Dokdo prosecutor's office?
- Do you want to go and take a long rest?
- Well, I'm just ...
I was just afraid Prosecutor Ma won't be able to get off for vacation this summer.
Oh, that's all right with me.
We barely talked the Chief out of visiting you at home.
The Chief?
He said that a single, living alone, feels pretty sad when he or she's sick.
Whether it's the Chief or whoever, we felt barging in unannounced wasn't right so we talked him out of it.
"Some chief or whoever"?
She said "the Chief".
She said "the" Chief or whoever.
Hey, Yoon Se Jun.
Aigoo, now that I look at it, taking sides and defending people seems to be your specialty.
I'm not taking sides.
This is Shin Jung Nam.
Do you have some time today?
You said you were President Ma Sang Tae's daughter?
Yes.
I heard the general story from Lawyer Seo In Woo.
Lawyer Seo came by?
As soon as you left.
I see.
I did make a promise to Lawyer Seo In Woo in front of my son,
but the moment the two of you appeared, Ma Sang Tae's daughter, and Department Chief Seo Dong Gun's son,
I felt that karma must really exist.
And I became really scared.
What is this?
Everything ... began because of this.
At that time, our Dong Ha had been in the hospital a long time because of a heart problem.
Please just give me a week.
I'll do whatever I can to come up with the money.
It's already been 3 months.
If you don't pay by tomorrow, you'll need to vacate the room.
You can't let a child die because of an incompetent father.
Just one week, no, just 3 days.
You have until tomorrow.
Because the hospital bill was unusually high,
I slipped out on my night shift very briefly to drop by the hospital.
Because I was on my way back from an unauthorized absence,
I was in a frantic rush, and it never even crossed my mind that it was President Ma Sang Tae.
Aigoo, I've been away from my post too long.
As I rushed to make my rounds, I saw the scene.
I saw President Yoo with Seo Dong Gun and money.
Hello?
A...
A person has died here!
After I made the report and returned, Department Chief Seo was already gone.
But the money was all still there.
I couldn't think about anything else, and I took the briefcase of money.
So there was a briefcase of money?
I could have never guessed that the briefcase of money was President Ma Sang Tae's.
It was ... my father's?
Dad, please.
What, exactly, do you want me to tell you?
All of it.
Everything that happened that day.
I want to hear it directly from you.
I have nothing to say.
Please don't do that, Dad.
I came, knowing everything.
You came knowing what everything?
I heard from Shin Jung Nam ... about your briefcase of money.
What do you mean "briefcase of money"?
That you told Shin Jung Nam if he didn't say he saw you, he could keep and use the money in the briefcase, and ... in addition, that you even paid Shin Jung Nam's son's hospital bills.
So, tell me what really happened.
Please clear it up with your own words.
Are you ... doing this because of that guy?
Seo Dong Gun's son, Seo In Woo?
H-how did you find out?
Kid, are you in your right mind?
How can you do this?
On his orders, you went around investigating your father?
I just wanted to know the truth!
If it wasn't for that guy, how would you have known about this?
!
He must have expected I would hunt it out.
Because he's someone who's lived 15 years with the goal of clearing his father's name when he returned.
What?
Han Jung Ran, Go Man Chul, Shin Jung Nam, no, I didn't find them purely on my own.
So, now that you have evidence, are you saying you're going to do something with me?
For him?
No.
If it was for him,
I would have already reported it.
If I was only thinking of him,
I would have knelt in place of you and begged for forgiveness 10 times, 100 times over!
What?
But, I couldn't.
Because you are my dad.
Before I saw any evidence,
I told myself it wasn't you ...
I prayed no evidence would surface, and yet,
when I thought about it,
I felt sorry for him.
Listen kid, he approached you intentionally.
If I were him, I think I would have done the same.
His father died in prison as a criminal.
Within four months of moving to the U.S., his mother died in a car accident.
He said he saw his mother die right in front of his eyes.
Dad,
I want to beg him to let you go, but I can't bring myself to.
How could I?
So then, if it was me, what would you do?
If your father is a criminal, what are you going to do?
I don't know.
That's why it's so hard, whether I think of him, whether I think of you ...
When I worry about you, I feel so bad for him.
So, I feel I'm going crazy.
Did that bastard make you this way?
Please tell me, what am I supposed to do?
She's really lovely, isn't she?
Because he's someone who's lived 15 years with the goal of clearing his father's name when he returned.
Han Jung Ran, Go Man Chul, Shin Jung Nam, no, I didn't find them purely on my own.
You really want to bury the past that much?
Then, you keep the past.
I'll have your daughter.
I don't know.
That's why it's so hard, whether I think of you, whether I think of him ...
When I worry about you,
I feel so bad for him, so ... so, I feel I'm going crazy.
Aigoo, what is with you?
Aigoo!
Aigoo!
Listen aeja, aeja, Park Ae Ja!
(aeja = darling child)
I guess you haven't forgotten that.
Aeja, aeja, Park Ae Ja!
You said that there's not much to life, didn't you?
You said that all you need is food in your belly, a warm back and what else was it?
Feeling at peace.
Then, that tiny little place we had when we first got married, were you happy with that?
Oh my gosh.
You even remember that!
Just so I could get a subcontract, you would go around every holiday, and offer all the big construction firm presidents kimchi that you made.
You liked that?
I was so good at making kimchi.
So, you're saying you liked being poor?
I'm not saying I liked being poor, I'm just saying I felt at peace.
Not me!
I really hated it!
I hated it with a passion!
Honey.
A tiny shack fit for a servant boy.
That mindset I lived with to get out of that incredible poverty!
Could you know?
Could Hye Ri know?
Ma Sang Tae, did something happen today?
Beginning with my child, the baby born trusting Ma Sang Tae!
I wanted to make a home to live in, plump and happy ...
With her eyes more beautiful than any of the world's jewels,
Hye Ri and then her children, and her children's children ...
I wanted to make it so they all could live well and happy!
Honey, what's the matter?
Something ... has gone wrong.
I didn't want it to be like this.
But, it looks like it may destroy my daughter.
Please sit.
You're really not like your father.
You're not Seo Dong Gun's son.
Your father was a soft-hearted man.
He was a good person with a soft heart.
When we were doing a large-scale construction project in Cheonji-dong,
Seo Dong Gun managed the negotiations.
He sided with the displaced residents to the very end.
That's why I said we'd give them 150% of the purchase price.
The displaced residents who've lived there all their lives and have to sell their land for dirt cheap, please give them a little more consideration, President.
Can't we give them 50% more?
Department Chief Seo, have you come as the representative for their side?
If he was as controlling, precise and strategic a person as you, he wouldn't have fallen victim that night.
Are you twisting this into my father's fault?
I'm just saying your character determines your destiny.
Like my Hye Ri, your father was the same way.
If Hye Ri was like me, your plan to approach her, you couldn't have even dreamed of it from the very beginning.
If Seo Dong Gun was like you, he wouldn't have been labeled a murder for the rest of his life.
It sounds like you're admitting that you framed him for a crime.
No.
I'm just angry at myself for not knowing you had embedded yourself in my daughter's life!
Then,
I'll ask you outright.
What do you want me to do?
I came because I wanted to know clearly what it is you wanted.
If you want me to beg for forgiveness, I will.
If you want me to kneel, I will.
I didn't frame your father intentionally.
If you're wanting to cover up the case,
I can't do that.
I don't want to be a father who drives a stake into his daughter's heart and ruins her life.
That's precisely what I want to return to my father.
The figure you want to be for your daughter,
I'm sure my father wanted to be the same for his son.
So, I can't allow it to be covered up.
Then ... if I admit it,
you'll leave Hye Ri?
Leave the daughter you approached because of me, and disappear forever?
Why don't you answer?
!
Didn't you say you came to clear your father's name?
It's not enough you used my innocent daughter and made her dig up her own father's case?
!
I have no further intentions.
Aside from clearing my father's name,
I don't have any desire to gain anything else.
Is this a promise, then?
My Hye Ri isn't like me.
She can't be ruthless.
If you intentionally keep hold of Hye Ri's emotions,
I won't leave you alone.
I give you my promise.
All right.
If you're Seo Dong Gun's son, you will keep your promise.
Another thing.
Don't tell Hye Ri anything, not even that we met.
Until I tell her myself, please wait.
I have to do it.
Why doesn't it occur to you that Hye Ri could be someone important to me too?
I'm not on such close terms with you, and I don't like to bother about our people's personal matters.
But your current state really makes a person worried.
Tell me about it.
Eh?
Why are you so surprised?
It's as if you committed some crime.
It's all right if you don't want to talk about it.
I just think that you look like you're in pain.
It wouldn't be very nice if I pretended nothing was going on, so I'm enquiring after you.
That ...
During the time Sunbae has been a prosecutor, have you ever done anything that went against your conscience?
What?
Are you worrying about being a prosecutor?
Everyone says that we are people who pursue justice.
But if the truth is frightening, what should we do?
If this truth is a type of harm for me and my family what would the other prosecutors do?
If it were Sunbae, what would you do?
Have you come across a similar circumstance?
Your question leads one to ponder, but the answer is very simple.
Very simple?
Solution:
None.
That's because every prosecutor's thinking and values are different.
Leave it to one's personal choices.
What if it were you?
If it was me ...
Can you cite an example?
Be more specific as to who committed what kind of wrong?
Ah ... it's not an intentional murder.
It's because of Lawyer Seo right?
Eh?
What happened to him?
Did something happen during the course of defending a case?
No.
Did you two break up?
For him and me, there's nothing to say about breaking up.
"Nothing to say about breaking up?"
What do you mean by that?
There is no relationship between us.
Absolutely no relationship.
He is actually such a jerk?
I didn't mean it that way.
Someone you shouldn't have ever met, someone with whom things will never work out?
It's about the same.
Then you should forget him quickly.
It's not easy to find someone with whom you can be together.
A person who has hurt you must be forgotten unconditionally.
Take this chance that everything is about to become memories and make a clean break.
Even though he has caused me pain, but can all this become memories?
Of course.
When the wounds have healed, everything will become blurry.
In the end, even the scars will have disappeared.
But there would also be scars that cannot disappear.
Ma Hye Ri, do you have something against me?
Why do you keeping saying things that are opposite to mine?
Are you going out?
Yes, to the Chief's office.
I came to get the combined records for that criminal case investigation.
Oh that ...
I'll find it myself, please go on ahead.
All right.
[Jung Seon
- Cherry Blossoms]
What is happening?
What is this doing here?
Did you find it?
Eh?
Didn't you say you wanted it?
Why didn't you take it with you?
Yes.
But Sunbae, those photos ...
What photos?
The cherry blossoms?
Yes, why do you have those pictures?
Why did you go to that place by yourself?
Who said that?
Who said I went by myself?
Sunbae, you are really ...
Were those photos sent to you by Bin?
My mother doesn't know how to operate a digital camera.
Bin didn't say anything right?
Say what?
- Say that you like me?
- Eh?
Why are you so surprised?
You said it yourself before.
I did?
When was that?
I only told Prosecutor Ma.
See ...
Didn't you say it before?
This ... that ...
Sunbae ...
I have to talk to the victim.
I'm leaving first.
Why are all the photos like this?
If I had known, I would have taken the photos when he used to smile more often.
Isn't that Prosecutor Ma?
Your illness is quite serious.
You gave me a shock.
You really like me that much?
What?
Just now, didn't you hide yourself and secretly take photos of me?
Why are you imitating me?
No ...
I didn't.
That's right.
Prosecutor Ma doesn't have my picture right?
But I have a lot.
I'm going in first.
All right.
Give your mind a holiday once in a while.
We'll go out of control for one day.
We'll be together for one day, Hye Ri.
Why did we come here?
To be your model.
You want me to take my hand phone and take photos at such a place?
Would I, Seo In Woo, have such poor taste?
Get out.
It's amazing.
The accessories for the perfect revenge plan.
There's even a camera.
At that time, did you use this to take my photos too?
Let me see.
Give it to me.
Give it to me.
Really.
Why aren't you taking photos?
You're asking me to take photos with just these few poses?
Why?
It's not to your liking?
This seems quite good.
Oh, that's not bad.
What did you say?
That pose just now ...
This ... this wasn't bad.
Really ... you're impossible.
All right, take the picture.
Okay!
That's the one.
One more.
It looks good.
This picture is really funny.
That's a lot of pictures.
Not bad.
He didn't even suggest taking a picture together.
Have you taken enough?
Let's go.
That ...
How about we take a picture together?
Why should we?
Can't we take one picture together?
- Of course not.
- Why not?
I don't take pictures with women casually.
Casually?
We're not lovers, and won't become lovers.
We're not friends, and not relatives.
We're nothing to each other.
Isn't that right?
If you're a lawyer, then act like a lawyer and make yourself clear.
Casually and nothing to each other.
Do they mean the same thing?
Then explain what is different about the two.
Your occupational habit of asking endless questions is occurring again.
You have to be careful about this.
Men dislike this the most.
The way women ask questions endlessly.
Women also dislike men such as Lawyer Seo.
Always needing to have your say.
Acting all cool and distant.
Butting in with your words when the woman hasn't finished speaking and...
And ... there should be more.
There's more?
There's a lot more.
So much more that it's scary.
So why are you still liking a guy like this?
Even secretly taking pictures of him.
What should I do with this popularity of mine?
You were the one who secretly took my picture first.
You're really not going to take a picture with me?
Yes.
Then return all the photos you took of me!
The ones that you took secretly.
How many photos did you take while investigating me behind my back?
Return them all to me.
All right, I'll return them.
I was planning to throw them away.
When are you coming to collect them?
What?
Why are you laughing?
That's why I said that there's no use for a photo.
Look at you ... at your current expression.
How to take a picture at such a time?
My mind, eyes and heart, are filled with all your expressions.
Thank you very much for today.
I was your model, and you're not even giving me some water to drink?
I'm leaving first.
How about we have a drinking competition?
Don't you have the alcohol tolerance of a god?
When I first returned to Korea, what was most amazing was this *somaek.
(*somaek is soju mixed with beer)
There has to be a spiral.
What happened?
I lost.
Bottoms up.
You have something to say to me right?
Say it now.
All the things you did today, is because you have something to say to me.
The things I did today?
What did I do?
Lawyer Seo.
It looks like you really wish to go back home quickly.
I understand.
I will let you return home early.
But from this moment on, you're only allowed to listen to me.
I speak, you listen.
Promise?
There are errors in the words I said before, and I wish to correct them.
Feeling that it was amusing to use you.
Ma Sang Tae, to cause you to end up in your own daughter's hands.
You were chosen not because of those reasons.
What do you mean ...
It may seem that I'm defending myself here.
But at that time I really needed you to become a prosecutor.
Even if I was a prosecutor, I would not be able to handle my own father's case.
With the exception of myself, would there be a prosecutor in this world who would be interested to investigate a case that ended over ten years ago?
Moreover, even if the investigation was started anew, nothing would be discovered.
What you are saying now, isn't it the same as before?
You chose me because I'm my father's daughter.
My thinking has changed.
At first, I was only trying to clear my father's name.
But, you were the safest method to take.
Why are you saying this now?
Although it's late, I would still like to apologize to you.
For using you, who had no prior knowledge,
I'm sorry.
But you have already apologized, and you even said it three times.
I'd like to sincerely apologize in front of you.
All right.
And ...
Even though I'm sorry,
I'm helpless.
For this I'm sorry.
Stop fooling around.
I'm not fooling around.
I just feel that this feeling is really good.
It's really good.
To have someone support you when you're unsteady.
It seems that all the parents in this world are the same.
Oh.
Are you unwell?
You're amazing.
Is it serious?
It seems like it's serious.
I can't go to work today.
I want to stay at home today and rest.
Let me help you with those.
Omo!
Who is this?
It's little Seo.
Oh my!
We actually bumped into each other here.
Give it to me.
Oh my.
Your family has brought you up well.
Please go ahead.
But, how did you suddenly appear here?
Just like a superman.
You didn't go to work?
I have some business around this area.
It seems that your work and life are all at your own pleasure.
If I had known, I would have asked our Hye Ri to be a lawyer instead.
A lawyer couple.
Doesn't it sound good?
No.
Prosecutor-lawyer couple sounds better.
Thank you.
I'll be leaving.
Why don't you drink some tea before leaving?
It's all right.
Then food ...
Have you had your meal?
If you haven't eaten, I'll prepare it immediately.
I've eaten.
But ... how do I put it ... the feeling is a little different compared to the previous time.
Is it because Hye Ri isn't here?
No, it isn't.
Did you have a fight with Hye Ri?
So that's the reason.
No wonder your face is sunken.
It's because you two had a fight.
We've broken up.
Broke ...
This ...
So I said ...
I'm sorry.
No, no, no.
What's there to be sorry about?
You're young adults, it's normal to break up.
Although it's like this ...
This is abalone porridge.
I was thinking of making some for Hye Ri.
You saw it just now, I bought all the ingredients, and specially came here to make it for her.
I'm all right.
I was so happy when I saw you just now that I didn't think much about it.
Feeling unwell the whole night, and didn't have anything to eat in the morning.
You actually went to the pharmacy before, right?
But you don't have to do this.
Just treat it like the ahjumma from the floor below made it for you.
Eat it.
Don't think of me as Hye Ri's mother.
A near neighbor is better than a distant relative.
If one is too concerned about saving face, he is bound to suffer disadvantages.
Quick come over.
I'm really all right.
Mother.
The porridge can be eaten very quickly.
So I'll just wait here and bring the bowl back when you have finished.
Yes.
Why did you and Hye Ri break up?
Did you two break up because Hye Ri's father dislikes you, and said something to you?
No, that's not it.
I have such a big mouth.
Quick eat.
Eat, eat.
I didn't say anything.
Hye Ri is very much like her mother.
How did you know?
In the past, Hye Ri was exactly like me.
It is I who is exactly like Hye Ri.
Yes.
It's my first time to hear a guy call me "Mother".
I heard you don't have a mother.
I was thinking I could have a son as well.
I was hoping to take care of you like a mother would.
If you have anything that needs my help ...
Who would come here?
It's my friend.
Friend?
Honey, I bought porridge.
Is this the aunty who cleans the house?
Be careful with your words.
I'm sorry, Mother.
I'm leaving.
Ma Hye Ri's mother?
Where did you ask mother to go?
She doesn't have many places she can go to.
I feel it's better to have your mother know about this at a later time.
Did they break up because he has another woman?
How can one person be so fickle?
Why did I say so much?
Mother?
When did you start calling Ma Hye Ri's mother "Mother"?
Along with that, when did you get to know Ma Hye Ri's mother?
You don't have to question me.
I really don't know why both mother and daughter are so simple and naive to allow themselves to be affected by you.
Don't say it that way.
The situation has already come to this, but she is still in the dark.
It doesn't matter if Hye Ri's mother knows or not.
We shouldn't be concerned about it.
What if Ma Hye Ri is not planning to reverse the judgment of the case?
There isn't much time left in the statute of limitations.
I know.
I'm reminding you because I'm worried you have forgotten.
The window is closing if you want to file a lawsuit against Ma Sang Tae during the prosecution period.
What is Ma Hye Ri doing now?
I don't know.
She should be taking some action.
Anyway, Ma Hye Ri's usefulness can only last to this point.
Ma Hye Ri cannot take charge of the case because it concerns her father.
The prosecutor's office will have to take over the investigation and find evidence that Ma Sang Tae is a killer.
Her usefulness lasts only up to this point.
But this is not easy for her.
You painstakingly orchestrated this because you know it's not going to be easy.
Are you asking the obvious?
That is her father.
I've said that she won't hand over her father to be investigated if she knows that he is a criminal.
You have also expected this.
She will definitely experience distress and agony.
She will conceal her own father's case, and remove her prosecutor's robe.
Do you still remember how much I had bet?
You said not to worry, and how much did you, Seo In Woo, bet?
You said you would act before she could do that.
Now is the time to do so.
Use the evidence that was previously uncovered to prevent her from concealing the case ...
Just wait a while longer.
In Woo.
Proving that Ma Sang Tae is the real culprit is the only way to clear your father's name.
Don't tell Hye Ri.
Wait until I tell her myself.
Just wait a while longer.
Why are you still waiting?
It's because I promised.
Didn't you have something to say to me?
I will now tell you the truth you've been so curious to find out.
Yoo Myung Woo was killed by me.
Brought to you by WITH S2 Written In The Heavens Subbing Squad
Main Translators: meju, pdt_85 Spot Translator: fore
Timer: julier Editor/QC: melica
Coordinators: mily2, ay_link
How do you do?
I'm Shim Gun Wook.
Why didn't you say anything?
About him being Mo Ne's brother?
I can even kill for you.
Have you begun to like him?
Now that you know who he is?
Brought to you by WITH S2 Written In The Heavens Subbing Squad
Everything you're curious about, what you want to know, I will tell you.
Yoo Myung Woo...
I killed him.
Dad.
At that time,
I ran the company unscrupulously.
When the development project I started on was in full swing, we were met with a problem of uncooperative relocators.
Seo In Woo's father, Chief Seo Dong Gun, was put in charge of negotiations.
EPISODE 15
We have to start construction work soon, the negotiations are not settled yet?
They're too adamant on their stand.
So why has this taken so long and is still not solved?
It's as if we didn't pay money but just snatched the land from them.
Right after the land sale, the authorities approved the development project, and the land value shot up.
Of course they feel like they lost out.
And so?
Chief Seo was too kind a man, so he couldn't handle being the negotiation leader of the uncooperative relocators.
Supervisor Song, the leader is called Yoo Myung Woo, right?
What does he do?
He's not a good guy, previous records of violence.
How can you be gentlemanly with someone like that?
This is the final compensation offer, it mustn't exceed two-fold.
Actually Yoo Myung Woo had other plans.
He wanted more money from our company on the quiet.
After the apartments are built, the profit is more than ten-fold.
But you're only giving us two-fold to get rid of us?
You told those relocators you got four-fold for yourself and incited them, and now you're trying to extract five-fold from us, what exactly are you doing?
Ma Sang Tae knew beforehand about the development project, and bought our land at a low price, everyone knows that.
Stop changing the topic.
He didn't get his way so he started to expose my secret.
It's Politician Kim, right?
See, it must be true,
Politician Kim Ki Han.
Politician Kim?
Dad, who...?
When you're in business, you need such connections.
So that man was blackmailing you?
Knowing the ties between me and Politician Kim, he demanded for money.
What did you say?
Politician Kim Ki Han from the Hope Party, and Jin Ri Construction's President Ma Sang Tae.
Wow, this is what I call a connection.
I plan to hold a press conference on this matter, let me use your office for that.
I brought the money he demanded for.
You want to expose me then show me the evidence.
You showed up here with the money so that proves it already.
Only then did I realize he blackmailed me without any evidence.
How much is in there?
Sign this.
What is this?
You don't know?
You met Chief Seo earlier, this is the compensation document.
There are two kinds of people who demand illegal compensation:
Those who use the uncooperative relocators as a screen out front, on the quiet taking money from the construction firms for himself, and the other kind...
lunatics.
What?
Come to my office tomorrow.
I'll give you a small fee.
You jerk, what do you take me for?
I handled it according to my own way of doing things, but Yoo Myung Woo's response was radically extreme.
Suddenly he started to strangle my throat, I wanted to get away so I gave him a push.
Everything happened so quickly.
I was too frightened so I failed to check if he was dead.
I didn't mean to kill him,
I just pushed him.
He was strangling my throat,
I got so mad.
Is that true?
Is it true it wasn't intentional?
If I could hide it, if I could hide it from you, no matter who had to bear the crime, I would bring it to my grave.
Why did you do that?
You should turn yourself in.
It wasn't a homicide, it was crime of violence and it was a mistake.
If you had turned yourself in, there wouldn't be someone who died innocently in jail.
Why didn't you turn yourself in after that?
At that time, I just couldn't do that.
I was afraid of losing everything,
I couldn't give up all that I had.
For me, there was no turning back.
Dad!
Yoo Myung Woo had requested to see me in person, but since Chief Seo was the man in charge of negotiations, I sent him to go instead.
Then later on I heard Seo Dong Gun was taken away as a suspect from the scene.
That's what I told the police.
Quit your prosecutor job and further your studies overseas.
What?
Because of me,
I don't want to see you being laughed at by everyone at the Prosecution Office.
I don't want that.
Dad, what are you saying?
I will settle it by turning myself in.
I don't want you to see me at my ugliest.
Turn myself in?
You once asked me, right?
Dad, what do you want me to do?
Dad, you tell me, what should I do?
Because of what I did in the past, my daughter asking me like that, as a father...
But don't think a small prosecutor like you, you think I'm telling you all this because I'm scared of you?
Dad.
You discuss it with your mum, where to go.
I will turn myself in within the statute of limitations*.
(*15 years for Korea) let Seo In Woo know.
No, don't, I'll do it myself.
Seo In Woo?
You said Seo In Woo?
What's this about...?
And your parents...?
She died when I was 14,
I grew up without a mother.
That's so unfortunate.
- Ah!
- Yeah!
Wow!
Son, try harder!
Mum.
Open your eyes, open them.
Why am I lying here?
With your build, you'd still faint when you're in shock?
That's right,
I went into shock.
How could Seo In Woo do that?
Did you two split up because of that woman?
What's your mum talking about?
Mum, you got it wrong.
A man who's gentle like the wind in Spring, can very well turn out to be a playboy, I almost forgot.
Oh my abalone congee, what if that woman ate it!
All my effort for nothing.
Your mum is talking about Seo In Woo?
So it's true.
The Seo In Woo I heard you talking about, is he the Seo In Woo that I know?
Murder, turning yourself in, manslaughter ... is that what happened between you and him, is that it?
Mum.
I told you not to come back before Hye Ri got home...
Hye Ri, what does all this mean?
Seo In Woo, how long have you been standing here?
3 days.
Aren't you hungry?
Very hungry.
You in that state, yet I brought muffins out to you so proudly.
But you didn't eat those muffins.
If I had known earlier,
If I had known at that time why you were standing here,
I would have tried calling my dad.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
But at that time, why didn't you say to me,
"Your father is Ma Sang Tae, right?"
"Your father killed someone and pinned it on my father."
"So stop pretending to be a nice person with these muffins, stop showing off."
Why didn't you say that to me?
If you heard that, I was afraid you'd cry.
I was afraid if I saw you cry, I couldn't help myself but to cry too.
So...
It was because of you that Seo...
Seo In Woo approached our Hye Ri, is that right?
The reason why he did it was, you killed a man, and framed someone else,
is that right?
You framed Seo's father...
Usually, you're not this naggy, I'm fed-up already.
You did that, did you?
After you killed someone, after that, you're still so full of yourself?
So...
You killed someone!
I didn't do it intentionally.
I told you,
I only wanted my father's crime exonerated.
You might not like my way of doing things, but as your father, I still love you.
This is Seo In Woo.
Yes, hello there.
This is Ma Hye Ri.
And?
Well, I need to talk to you.
What is it?
You said you had something to tell me?
Sorry, Lawyer Seo, no...
Mr. Seo In Woo.
I'm so sorry.
In place of my dad, your father was convicted, wrongly accused, tortured and suffered badly.
I am very sorry.
My dad...admitted it.
He did?
You must feel terrible.
But my dad said he didn't do it intentionally.
"Didn't do it intentionally" meaning...
When they were caught in the fight, he pushed him, he fell then he died.
I know people will not believe what my dad said,
Lawyer Seo, I know you too will not believe him, but I...
I believe him.
My dad is going to turn himself in.
Turn himself in?
He's going to turn himself in for involuntary manslaughter?
I know what you're thinking.
If he admits to causing death out of self-defense, the 7-year statute of limitations is over already.
But if there's no evidence to prove that it was involuntary manslaughter, do you know what will be the end result?
It will be considered murder and the statute of limitations changes from 7 to 15 years.
Mum!
At this hour, why are you here?
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
You...
How could you do that?
Ah!
Ah!
You bad girl.
Terrible girl.
How can a daughter send her father to jail?
Why must you investigate this case?
Are you blinded by a man?
That's not true.
I wanted to find out, I had to know the truth.
Know what?
What is it you wanted to find out?
You ought to have covered it up even if you knew, how could you pry it open yourself?
Family is everything, a daughter who doesn't help her dad, you call that a daughter?
Your dad may be terrible, but he's so worried about you.
He wants me to quickly take you overseas.
Before you get shamed by everyone, he wants you to quit your job as prosecutor right away.
Why don't you beg for Seo's forgiveness?
Beg him to let us off, it's your dad, you know.
I want to beg him too,
I very much want to, do you know how much I wish I could beg him?
I want him to forgive my dad, to forgive dad, but when I see him, I can't bring myself to say it.
I just can't bring it up.
You like him, right?
That's why you're speaking up for him, right?
No, mum, that's not true.
Because of Dad,
I know what kind of life he led, and because I know what he has lost, he lived without a mother and a father for 15 years...
Yes, Seo lived without his parents, he must have suffered for 15 years.
Because of your father.
Oh poor thing.
Why does my heart hurt so much for Seo?
Is it because you love him, is that why you're crying like this?
If you love him that much, how badly your heart must be hurting.
My poor child, why did your dad do something like this back then?
So how did he bear it all this time?
What will happen to my Ma Sang Tae?
Mum, I'm sorry.
What will happen to me?
At this age, how am I going to live...
Mum, don't worry.
I'll quit as a prosecutor and I'll fight Dad's case as his lawyer.
Mum, so sorry.
Where did all my clothes go?
Mum!
Mum, we've been robbed.
I really left it at the laundry.
If you wash 5 sets, 2 sets are free for dry-cleaning.
Granny, isn't that right?
Ironing's for free too.
But you couldn't have left all my clothes there.
What am I going to wear to the office?
The skirt suit then.
Skirt suit?
Otherwise, just wear jeans.
Jeans!
Jeans?
How can a prosecutor wear jeans to the office?
I'm not Prosecutor Ma, you know.
What else can you do?
We can't get the clothes back yet.
Why aren't you out yet?
Sunbae, how about you go ahead to the office first?
I...
Um...
Something came up.
What?
Skirt?
Well...
What?
Bin sent me a message.
Come out.
Alright.
The time's already very late, I'm wandering in my dreams
I'm drawn into a pink colored love The cold spring shower has turned warm too
My cold heart is welcoming love
What's wrong with your legs?
What about them?
Do my legs look strange?
No, not strange.
They're pretty, very pretty.
Nice figure.
No, what I mean is, you have such pretty legs, why walk like that?
You're walking like a crab.
Oh, was that how I walked?
Sunbae, why don't you get in the car first?
Alright.
Sunbae, I'm fine, Sunbae!
If you don't keep still, I'll leave you here and I'll go off myself.
This is terrible, what am I to do?
Hello.
What's this?
What?
A skirt?
Too long for a skirt.
Prosecutor, you should keep up this dressing.
No, my mum sent all my clothes to the laundry so I...
Wow, you look nice.
No.
You should have dressed like this sooner.
You look sexy.
Prosecutor, you can't say that in the office.
Manager Kang, it's me.
I have some stuff to pass on to you.
Father,
what should I do?
What to do?
Father!
Father.
Father.
Quit your job as prosecutor and further your studies overseas.
Because of me,
I don't want to see you being laughed at by everyone at the Prosecution Office.
I don't want that.
[Resignation Letter]
Come here.
I'm sure she feels like dying.
Good morning, everybody.
Well, yes, yes, Trouble-maker Prosecutor Ma is here.
Lots of memories made here.
Aigoo and who is this?
Isn't that Prosecutor Ma Hye Ri?
Don't you remember me?
I'm Lawyer Seo In Woo.
Shall I give you my name card again?
In this situation, why are you here?
Prosecutor Ma, eat with me.
I'm really hungry.
Now, we don't have the ties to be able to eat comfortably together.
Eating this will make you very happy.
If you eat with me, I will reveal big news, good news, to you.
Really.
Stop!
Stop, stop, stop, stop!
Oh, I was almost too late.
Don't eat that, let's eat this together.
It's sushi.
Is my face dirty?
If you're not doing this on purpose, could it be your personality is the kind that always makes others mad?
Isn't that your personality?
Here.
Exact same location, exact same sushi.
You brought me here on purpose, right?
I just wanted to start a fire.
You like sushi so much but why won't you have any?
How about just eat one?
It's good.
Don't choke, eat slowly.
It's delicious, that's why.
Where did you get this sushi from?
We've become folks who can't chat with each other, right?
That's right.
We have to go our different ways.
You came to the Prosecution Office because of my dad?
Let's not see each other again.
I said, let's not meet again.
We've been meeting too often already, your face easily suffers from "aesthetic fatigue"*" (*reduced appreciation due to overexposure)
Right now, you're still in the mood for joking?
Are you joking with me?
I'm not joking.
If you're not, how can you say things like we shouldn't meet again?
You think we meet because we want to see each other's faces?
Your father's case...
No,
Yoo Myung Woo's case, stop the investigation.
So long as we don't concern ourselves with this case, we won't have to meet again, right?
You don't get it?
Shall I say that again?
Why?
Why suddenly...?
Just because I wanted to clear my father's name, it doesn't mean I should wrong a good man.
My dad...
You believe him?
It doesn't matter whether I believe him or not, the murder case was closed 15 years ago, it will be too difficult to get evidence to prove that it was actually an accidental death.
That may be the case, but then...
Leave it, let's just do that.
What is this?
Isn't this Ma Hye Ri?
[Redevelopment Project - Too Much Demolition
- Public Criticism]
[Displaced Residents Representative Yoo Myung Woo Killed]
Father of a present prosecutor was involved in a murder case 15 years ago.
The truth may be hidden by some parties, please conduct a thorough re-investigation.
Attached are material proofs related to the case.
What is this?
Your hand phone was off, where did you go?
Jenny, book our tickets.
What?
We're heading back to the States.
I've had enough of this country already.
You already told Ma Hye Ri?
You said you're letting off President Ma Sang Tae, is that right?
Yes.
He didn't kill Yoo Myung Woo directly, he just gave him a push and didn't expect him to die, and you believe that?
Are you crazy?
How can you trust the word of Ma Sang Tae?
Didn't you read the case file?
Was there any indication at all, of the possibility that Yoo Myung Woo died from a fall?
I know what you're saying, the situation at the scene of the crime, I can remember that clearly.
Then why?
Why do you believe Ma Sang Tae?
He said he will turn himself in for his daughter's sake.
For her sake, he was willing to let her resign as a prosecutor.
He is not the Ma Sang Tae we know.
So the Ma Sang Tae we knew suddenly found his conscience overnight?
That's not what I mean, to Hye Ri, he's just her father.
Then have you given up on your father?
To clear your father's name, the case must be reopened.
To reopen the case, we must get fresh evidence.
And the fresh evidence is the real murderer back then.
Shall I say that again?
Ma Sang Tae must stand in the court of trial.
If in court, it can't be proven as accidental death, it'll be manslaughter.
Why do you have to worry about that?
That will be decided by the court.
Because he's Hye Ri's father.
Your feelings for Ma Hye Ri, exceeds the grievances your father had to bear?
I already asked my father.
Father would surely not want to see me live unhappily.
Nobody wishes for the one they love to face misfortune.
Then my heart will ache too.
Your feelings for Ma Hye Ri, have gone that far?
You love her that much?
If I'm the one to send Hye Ri's father to court, if I'm the one to force Hye Ri to resign as a prosecutor, if I'm the one to destroy everything in her life,
and I leave, then the rest of my life,
I'm not sure I can live properly.
What is it you want from me?
To clear my father's name.
I knew it would be painful, but I still hurt you,
I can't stop now.
Aren't you a prosecutor?
I didn't ask for anything from your father,
I only told you to clear my father's name.
If you're a prosecutor, that wouldn't be a problem.
Your father's case...
No,
Yoo Myung Woo's case, stop the investigation.
How much more do you want to suffer?
It'd be easier for you to hate me.
He wants to give it up now?
I heard Ma Sang Tae's case will not be reopened.
Ms. Ma Hye Ri, do you love In Woo?
Do you like him?
Such a question, why are you the one asking?
Do you really love him?
What is it you want?
Whether you love him or like him, how did In Woo know how you feel?
Did you tell him?
You told In Woo?
You did, right?
I did.
Why did you?
I really cannot understand you.
I dislike you, you're totally shameless.
Jenny!
You can't do a single thing for In Woo, there's nothing you can do so why did you say it?
Was it so that In Woo would not be cruel to you, or so that your father would be saved?
You don't understand, so don't say things so casually.
In Woo is returning to the States, because of you, empty handed.
Because In Woo loves you, he gave up everything.
What have you lost?
Your parents are safe, your assets are safe, your job is safe too.
For In Woo to come back here, all the sufferings he bore, and the hard work he put in, he even gave up all his time spent on this.
What can I do for my abandoned love?
Stumbling about looking for the love who left me.
How can I abandon my love?
Tell me it's just a dream.
When I open my eyes, all I see is darkness.
Clenching on to shattered memories.
While knowing it cannot be pieced together.
My reluctance to let go breaks my heart even more.
Only tears are filling my broken heart.
[Ma Hye Ri]
This is Seo In Woo.
I will clear the name of your father, so you too, must prove my father's mistake.
What do you mean?
I will prove that your father was not a murderer so you too, must prove that my father was not a murderer.
Stop using tongue twisters, what you just said, don't tell me you're going to report your father yourself?
Are you crazy?
Do you know how difficult that is?
I know it's difficult.
Just leave the case unopened.
Then why did you not intend to reopen the case?
You can then clear your father's name, right?
Why do you care about what happens to my father?
My father, to me, is already in the past, but your father, to you, is not just the present but the future too.
If something went wrong, it will mean that I have destroyed you.
I don't want to live with guilt the rest of my life.
Then what about me?
Lawyer Seo, if that's what you think, then more so for me, even more so.
Stop displaying your useless sympathy, just close your eyes.
So who is showing sympathy to whom?
Me?
To you?
Do you know how hard it was for me to arrive at this decision?
Did you think doing this was easy for me?
That's why I said you shouldn't.
I told you to give up the idea.
You think, this matter can be hidden just by hiding it away?
You make me...
You make me hate myself, look down on myself, how can I live?
Don't get emotional when handling this matter.
Emotional enough to want to die, to go crazy, that's being human.
If I let you go just like that,
I will never be able to love my dad like I do now.
Not like now, how I shop for clothes and shoes at will, I won't be a prosecutor too,
I'll be guilty for life, thinking about you.
It will be the most painful thing for me.
Then what if things don't happen as you imagined?
I believe my dad.
He is definitely not a man who kills with a purpose.
Since that is the truth,
I just have to try my best to prove it.
Then why would my father be bearing those charges, if the truth will surely be proven?
Because at that time, my dad didn't tell the truth.
So Dad, please trust me and wait for me.
You want me to trust you?
I will protect you, I will have the truth revealed.
Oh dear,
I can understand Hye Ri, but I'm worried for you too.
Dad, maybe you can't accept this, but if this case is not reopened,
I will feel guilty for the rest of my life.
Do you know how it feels to be guilty?
What will happen if you're guilty for the rest of your life?
I won't be able to breathe, I'd suffer every day.
How I'd wish to be dead, wishing someone would come and end my life, that's how it will feel.
Oh dear, you must really be suffering.
I can understand that.
When I gave birth, when I gave birth to you, it was so painful that I wished someone would kill me.
How did Ma Sang Tae's life become like this?
Why did it turn out like this?
But Seo is truly exceptional.
My daughter is better than him a million times over!
You're here.
You're beyond rescue.
Thanks.
Prosecutor Ma Hye Ri, what did you just say?
To reopen Yoo Myung Woo's murder case?
A murder case which was closed 15 years ago, is that correct?
Yes.
What is happening?
Are you being threatened and forced to report this?
What?
No.
But is this... to be taken as fortunate or unfortunate?
Coincidentally someone complained about your father's case, and I was struggling over what to do.
What?
Prosecutor Ma said nothing will happen.
Let's just leave it.
Alright, I'll do as you instructed.
You may go.
President, Mr. Seo In Woo is here.
Hello, I'm Lawyer Seo In Woo.
Lawyer Seo In Woo?
Ma Hye Ri got me to come.
What an eye-opener!
Is this a generation gap thing or are you young people being too open-minded?
Hye Ri and you, how can young people be thinking like this?
Your daughter failed to mention my coming here?
Sit, you sit down first.
When she mentioned it to me, I said you're not to come here, didn't she tell you?
You fighting my case, does that make sense?
Who am I?
I'm your sworn enemy!
I'm not doing this because I like it.
That's why!
Why would Hye Ri tell me to trust you...?
What are you planning to do?
Are you still scheming against my Hye Ri?
Ma Hye Ri and I have reached an agreement, that's all.
We'll work towards keeping both our fathers safe.
Why must it be you?
Because I'm most familiar with the case, and the most capable lawyer.
What?
Anything related to the case,
I'm the one who knows it best.
Next to you, of course.
Probably, I know more than you do.
I'll go now.
Before that,
I need to check one thing.
Do you remember the promise you made to me?
You came to my daughter in order to get to me, can you disappear from her life forever?
I promise you that.
I remember that.
Since you do, you should know you have to keep to it.
Promise me again that you will keep that promise.
If you won't, I will definitely not use you as my lawyer.
I am the son of Seo Dong Gun.
That's right, you're the son of Seo Dong Gun.
Firstly, I'd like to explain about this case, things which I wouldn't share with your daughter.
Things you couldn't tell Hye Ri?
That day, how did you find out so quickly, that Seo Dong Gun got arrested?
That was before the case was reported in the news.
How did you know to order Seo Dong Gun to the scene of the crime?
You must tell me.
The person who helped you, was it Politician Kim Ki Han?
Politician Kim, it's me.
Yes, so how are things?
Did you give him the money?
Something happened.
I explained the situation to him rather simply.
He said he didn't think anyone saw it, and told me to cover it up.
He said he thought no one saw it, how did Politician Kim know?
Must I really tell you such things?
I am now President Ma Sang Tae's lawyer.
He checked out the scene of the crime.
You said you told him about the situation, can you explain in more detail, what you told him?
He strangled my throat so I pushed him.
He slipped and his head hit a stone, he appeared dead.
These things, you mentioned it in the phone call?
So behind Seo In Woo, there's all these complicated affairs.
Oh dear.
What will happen to Prosecutor Ma?
Okay.
This case is not small, you must be extra, extra careful.
And the statute of limitations for this case is almost over, so Prosecutor Yoon can't manage alone, Prosecutor Jin, you help too.
Alright.
What's all this about?
You must be shocked.
No wonder you asked me, what if the truth is really scary?
I really didn't know what to do.
How terrible it must have been to suffer alone.
You should have trusted me and shared with me, I keep secrets well.
I should have.
Chief has assigned me and Prosecutor Jin to your father's case.
That's what I expected.
Such matters are tough.
You know what I'm going to say, right?
Yes, please proceed with the way you do things, that will be fine.
[Re-examine crime scene pictures.]
I looked through cases where a defendant who was a suspect in the earlier trial, was declared innocent in the high court.
In 1996, 8 such cases.
Oh!
Excuse me...
How did it go with my dad?
Was it alright?
Did my dad reveal everything?
I think so.
I told you nothing will happen, why wait out here?
Stay indoors.
Dad must have blown his top, right?
We'll talk inside.
What my dad said, did you record it all down?
I wanted to organize it but I'm not allowed to see his records.
I wanted to ask a favor from Sunbae Yoon at the Prosecution Office, but Lawyer Seo you...
Ah!
I'll do that.
I'll first organize it chronologically, that'll work.
Prosecutor Yoon, no, if I ask Prosecutor Jin, she will show it to me.
No need for that.
Why?
We have to look closely at the records.
Then we can...
- Ma Hye Ri.
- Yes?
If that's all the gumption you have, then why did you stir up such a big trouble?
How can you start getting nervous at this point?
I am not nervous.
I need to look at those statements soon but I can't.
You're arguing with me, isn't that you being nervous?
Come with me, don't worry about the records.
What do you mean?
Lawyer Seo, Lawyer Seo!
The ambience of this place has changed.
I had planned to leave, after some packing, it's more spacious now.
So from now on, let's make this our office.
Here?
Or we can go to my office.
Or you can rent your own office.
No, time is wasted in traveling anyway, and this is not the time for me to be fussy.
Take a look.
What is this?
These are the records I organized and summarized,
I've highlighted all the important parts, you'll know after you've read it.
How did you do this...?
Did you copy it all down when you looked through the records, then organized it yourself after that?
I think so.
Even photos of the crime scene, you copied it all down?
Since no photocopying or digital scanners are allowed.
This is the scary, meticulous and stubborn man that I am.
Alright?
Let's start work.
I don't mean that.
Having done so much, someone who has done so much, how did he make the decision...?
Aren't you going to do any work?
I will, of course.
I've thought about a few scenarios.
There are two things we must do.
To prove that my dad doesn't have a motive to murder Yoo Myung Woo, and to prove that Yoo Myung Woo died an accidental death.
Because Yoo Myung Woo was strangling my dad, he pushed him towards the cabinet.
But we don't know how he slipped, right?
See, actually he could have slipped, but there's nothing on the floor.
But having nothing on the floor, could be proof that President Ma Sang Tae caused Yoo Myung Woo to fall onto the stone.
In that case, it's faster to prove that my dad doesn't have a motive to kill Yoo Myung Woo.
If we could only get Politician Kim Ki Han's statement, but he kept insisting he doesn't know the guy.
Isn't there any other way?
At the scene of the crime, my dad called him first and told him it wasn't intentional, even if he made his statement after he heard all this...
He'd be afraid to have his affairs exposed, so he will surely refuse to give his testimony.
Let's see if there's a hold of Politician Kim Ki Han to get his testimony.
A hold?
We must get a hold of him to make him speak up.
He told my dad, the information about Seo Dong Gun being arrested, telling him to frame your father, giving him ideas and suggestions.
You've sure grown a lot, Prosecutor.
What?
Coincidentally someone complained about your father's case, and I was struggling over what to do.
Could it be...
What is it?
Doing all this with me now, could it be part of some revenge or something?
That's not the case, right?
What did you say?
Nothing.
Nothing, nothing.
Sorry.
It's not that I'm suspicious of you, but there is something strange.
It's true I did stuff worthy of suspicion, so even if you suspect me, it's to be expected.
But that's not the case.
I know, of course I know.
Oh, why did I bring this up?
I agree.
You said there was something strange, seems like something happened?
What is it?
In Woo is returning to the States, because of you, empty handed.
Nothing.
So on the day of the crime, those uncooperative relocators who met with Yoo Myung Woo, and the detectives in charge of the case at that time, I'll pay them another visit.
Let's take a break.
The race is going to be a long one.
Oh, you must be hungry?
Aren't you?
Sometimes I think you're omniscient.
Let's work well together.
It will turn out well, right?
It has to.
Surely it will be.
Right?
It will turn out well, right?
Of course, see who I am.
1995 May 20, in a container at the Jeonjin-dong redevelopment site, you killed Yoo Myung Woo, is that true?
No.
I did push him, but I didn't kill him.
That day, I could tell he was very uneasy.
There was blood on his pants too.
Blood?
Can you explain it in more detail?
Hello, President.
- He used to come with Go Man Chul, so I knew him.
- Put it down and leave.
But he refused to acknowledge me that day.
I placed the wine down and just as I was about to leave,
I saw his pants stained with blood.
Yes, I saw his pants stained with blood, and helped him make his alibi too.
I got money from him too.
There's blood but Hyung, you definitely would not kill anyone.
What exactly have you done?
Oh really.
I told you it's nothing.
The next day,
I brought this briefcase of money to pay for hospital fees, but in President Ma Sang Tae's name, payment was already made.
I think he came before 10am.
At that time, I remembered.
That was the President's car.
This briefcase of money was also his.
So what did you do with it later on?
I called the number given to me by the President.
He said he had been wanting to help me, he told me to set up a small business with the briefcase of money.
So,
I immediately quit my job as a security guard.
Send this over to the scientific investigation bureau, analyze it for Yoo Myung Woo's blood and Ma Sang Tae's fingerprints too.
Also, have them check out the other marks left on this briefcase.
Yes, Prosecutor.
Ma Sang Tae's claim of accidental death cannot be established?
Yes, there is no evidence to suggest it's an accidental death.
It's just his own claim.
Then what about evidence for murdering Yoo Myung Woo?
Evidence for murder is not clear too.
15 years ago, the incriminating evidence that caused Seo Dong Gun to be suspected, was his fingerprints on the stone, but Ma Sang Tae's fingerprints were not on that stone.
If the stone wasn't used to hit his head, if it's his head that hit the stone, then there wouldn't be fingerprints.
That is only a deduction.
So Prosecutor Yoon, you intend to prosecute?
I think we should indict him for manslaughter.
Since the statute for limitations is almost over, there's really not enough time for investigations.
We should go ahead with the indictment, and take more time to investigate before the trial.
I agree with that idea.
What are the points for suspicion anyway?
A man in a hurry to get away, how could he have created his alibi so quickly?
And even sealed the witness' mouth so promptly, those moves were made too quickly.
But once you see someone die, there will be extreme fear, making up an alibi at that point, covering up the truth, that is possible too.
That's why, we have to clear this up at the trial.
Why must we insist on indicting?
Not just accidental death, we can't even establish a case for manslaughter, why are we indicting?
If he is found not guilty, it'll be so embarrassing.
The accused related about being there at the crime scene at that time, he was blood-stained and even in his flustered state, he gave 5 billion won cash to seal a witness' mouth.
Most critically, Yoo Myung Woo and he were having a dispute over the compensation negotiations.
There's sufficient motive for manslaughter.
But the actual process of the murder is completely unclear, right?
That's why time is necessary.
So long as the statute of limitations is not in place,
Prosecutor Yoon doesn't like it too and it's not just anyone else, but Prosecutor Ma's father, why would we want to indict him?
Who doesn't know that?
Why say it like that?
I'm already so vexed over this case.
But why must Prosecutor Ma's father, do something like this at that time?
Okay, we'll...go with the majority.
To indict Ma Sang Tae for manslaughter, those prosecutors advocating this, please raise your hands.
Okay.
Then those who advocate accidental death and since the statute of limitations is over, so we have no right to indict, those who advocate this?
It's 2 against 2.
Prosecutor Jin, what about you?
I'm sorry, I really don't know what to do.
To investigate the truth at the time of trial, sounds like the right thing to do, accidental death sounds right too, between the two...
This won't do.
We'll submit this case to the Prosecution Committee,
I can't continue.
Mr. Seo In Woo is here.
Aigoo, nice to meet you.
Thank you for the warm welcome.
I'm Seo In Woo.
You are willing to contribute so substantially, and you're so young too.
Come, sit down.
So what do you do?
This is...
What is this?
You can call it the book of life and death, or you can call it a list of the dead.
Who are you?
I called you earlier on, but you claimed not to be acquainted with President Ma Sang Tae.
Do you still not remember him?
President Ma Sang Tae.

Because it's not easy to forget someone who hurt you.
Brought to you by WITH S2 Written In The Heavens Subbing Squad
No, it's nothing, Bank Manager.
There's been a misunderstanding.
President!
If we don't take care of the bill immediately, they're going to halt all the construction!
Hold on a moment.
Why is that?
And bonds that still haven't expired are being returned.
What?
!
What in the world...?
Hel
- Hello...
Yes?
Tell me again.
Why are the bonds being returned?
Did you see the newspaper?
Since dawn, in order to make the renewal date,
I briefly met with President Lee to ask for an extension on the loan expiration.
I exhausted all my energy, and as soon as I came back
I answered Superintendent Kim's call.
The fact that you were investigated by prosecutors made the newspaper!
The news?
!
It came out?
That it was me?
!
That it was Ma Sang Tae?
No, not exactly, but there are rumors that it's the president of our company!
So, the rumors... made things the way they currently are.
Bring me the newspaper.
What should I do about the accounts?
Of course we're going to pay them off!
If we don't, everyone will say the rumors are true and we're over.
Don't you know that?

[ST Construction's President was Investigated at the Public Prosecutor's Office for a 15 Year Old Murder]
S-Still... the meeting in the chief's office isn't finished?
Because of an uneven number, they decided to do a criminal investigation.
Yes.
Yes.
Last Episode
Sunbaenim, you intentionally made the vote that way, right?
What are you talking about?
Didn't you do this after considering Seo In Woo's father's court appeal?
What are you talking about?
This is a case that must be considered, even without that.
With what we have, we can't say it was an assault, and if we continued investigating and the time for an appeal passes,
Seo Dong Gun's verdict review will become more difficult.
For both Prosecutor Ma and Seo In Woo, indisputably, clearing the case would be best.
Yes.
For Seo Dong Gun, who isn't guilty, we have to do this.
Just because it went to arraignment, he's not going to be indicted.
Don't worry too much.
Politician Kim Ki Han promised to come forth and give a statement.
How did you make him give a statement?
My daughter is making you look into my past.
Then, about what happened... he's going to tell the prosecutors everything?
He's going to.
About the fact that President Ma Sang Tae pushed Yoo Myung Woo while trying to stop him, the fact that my father was arrested as a suspect, the fact that he told him about it.
He promised to tell everything.
What a relief.
Um... my dad, just wait a bit for him.
My dad and I are not alike.
I know.
You know that my dad doesn't know how to show his feelings?
You said you're not the same.
You stay.
She knows you're here working.
I'm sorry for bothering you while working.
No, it's okay.
Go on down.
Ma Hye Ri is more amazing than I thought.
She's amazing.
Let's hear what you have to say first.
I'm talking about that.
Ma Hye Ri must have not told you.
Why didn't she?
What?
I sent it.
The package asking to investigate the case so that Prosecutor Ma Hye Ri couldn't cover it up.
What?
It's really a relief that she acted like a prosecutor.
If she hid it, she would have gotten into a lot of trouble.
You sent President Ma Sang Tae's package?
Why?
What are you doing without saying anything to me?
!
Don't be like that.
You're the one who broke the promise first.
What do you mean "broke the promise"?
It was my work.
You said you wanted to help me as a friend.
A promise isn't just pinky swearing with each other.
Not Ma Hye Ri, but you covering up the case;
even in my wildest dreams, I couldn't have seen that coming.
When someone suffers a thing she couldn't even dream about, it's really ridiculous.
Stop.
If I knew you were going to be like this, do you think I would have come to help you?
You're right.
I broke my promise.
I'm sorry.
No,
I came to apologize.
I'm sorry for going along with the plan without saying anything to you.
And I'm relieved that Prosecutor Ma exceeded my expectations.
Okay, next... is the case that Prosecutor Jin and Prosecutor Yoon are investigating.
Ah,
I'll be leaving now.
A reference is supposed to come.
Okay, get going.
Today you're conducting the second investigation of President Ma Sang Tae, right?
And yesterday, you took politician Kim Ki Han's statement?
Yes.
It'll be hard, but do your best.
This is going to determine our fate.
I'll be sitting with you only, because I cannot take part in the investigation.
What did he say when he called you?
He said that Yoo Myung Woo choked him, so he pushed him, but he hit his head or something.
I said that Yoo Myung Woo tried to choke me, so I pushed him, but he hit his head and may have died.
The fact that Seo Dong Gun was arrested as the suspect, why did you tell that to Ma Sang Tae?
While I was looking into the situation,
I thought carefully and told him.
Since Seo Dong Gun was arrested, he told me not to surrender myself to the police.
After you fled from the scene, why was Kim Ki Han the first person you called?
It's because he knew why I was meeting Yoo Myung Woo.
The reason he called me,
I don't know.
Why isn't Prosecutor Yoon coming out?
Well...
The investigation... did it go well?
Hurry on.
Don't act like you know me.
When you get old, this is what happens.
I'm sorry.
Seo Dong Gun's son,
I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry.
In Woo,
I'm not a murderer.
I... didn't kill anyone.
I swear.
That's not why.
It's because I don't want to cry in front of you.
Did you bring garbage?
These things were all in the picture of the crime scene.
Let's try slipping on each one, to see how we fall, okay?
Put this here.
That's dangerous.
I almost fell.
I'll hold you, so try again.
What?
It's hard to slip on it.
I'll do it.
Let's try this right.
If he pushed him towards the cabinet, it means that he had no intention of killing him.
Try to choke me.
What?
Just like President Ma Sang Tae's statement, the way Yoo Myung Woo tried, choke my neck.
Okay.
I'm going to grab on.
Okay.
This isn't it.
Again.
What?
Something was here.
Something was definitely here.
We tried everything.
On the day of the murder, the squatter who drank alcohol with Yoo Myung Woo said Yoo Myung Woo bought soju, and said that he was going to see President Ma Sang Tae.
The detective in charge said the crime scene reeked of alcohol.
Hold on!
Hold on.
What?
You're going to meet the president right now?
Representative Yoo, have you been drinking by any chance?
Hello?
It was after 9 then.
While Yoo Myung Woo was waiting for your father in the container, he called my father.
He was drinking alcohol.
But there's no evidence that he'd been drinking.
It's because they fought.
But that's weird.
People say that Yoo Myung Woo only drank boxed soju, why is there no boxed soju?
There are only flat things here.
It's because he stepped on it while they were fighting!
Wait here just a bit!
Where are you going?
[Existing Legislation]
[Existing Legislation, Loading]
Will we be able to prove it?
Oh, where'd you go?
What's that?
Here.
Step on it.
What?
Step on it.
Yes.
Hard.
I'm stepping on it.
Okay.
Oh, the smell.
Let's try.
I'll do it.
You're too light.
What?
Are you okay?
Oh my God.
Are you okay?
Lawyer Seo!
Are you okay?
I almost cracked my head.
The civil investigation is the day after tomorrow, what does Ma Sang Tae's lawyer have to show us?
He said he has proof that Ma Sang Tae didn't intentionally kill Yoo Myung Woo.
Really?
With what?
A video made by Korean Forensics;
he said he'll bring it.
Video?
On May 20, 1995, the murder case of Yoo Myung Woo that took place in Chung Ji Dong, Gaegibal,
I'm going to show you that the suspect, Ma sang Tae, did not murder him, but assaulted him.
Looks like he found something.
We'll see.
Ma Sang Tae was choked first by Yoo Myung Woo, so he pushed him and he turned around on his way out, and he stated that he saw him hit his head on a rock.
In the state of the scene, for Yoo Myung Woo to hit the cabinet and fall, he would have had to slip on something.
If Ma Sang Tae's assertion is true...
The evidence that was taken from the scene consisted of paper, plastic bags, cigarette cartons, and a phone.
After having tested them all,
Yoo Myung Woo stepped on this soju box and fell.
It could have popped open during the fight.
That's exactly right.
It popped open during the fight.
It's because he stepped on the box, which was wet from the soju, that he fell.
The victim, Yoo Myung Woo, was 180cm tall
89 kilograms, with a heavy physique.
He hit the cabinet and because of the recoil, his body came forward and he stepped on this soju box and hit his head on the rock.
In the case records,
Yoo Myung Woo, who had bought four soju boxes, was seen by someone, as his co-worker stated.
In addition, the detective who was at the scene, said the crime scene reeked of alcohol.
From the evidence, the only box that was stepped on was this one.
Also,
Yoo Myung Woo's wounds match-up with him hitting the cabinet.
That's right.
That's right.
I've also slipped like that once.
Ma Sang Tae pushed Yoo Myung Woo into the cabinet.
A person doesn't die just because he is pushed into a cabinet.
With just this fact, we know that he didn't mean to kill him.
How do we know that Yoo Myung Woo is the one who hit the cabinet?
On the day of the murder, the employee who at the scene last said that while he was cleaning up the cabinet was still intact when he left.
The people who went to the scene were Yoo Myung Woo, Ma Sang Tae, Seo Dong Gun.
Just these three people, so I used other cases to try this theory out.
Even if he was pushed with the same strength, depending on the physique, the results differ.
183 cm, 79 kg will fall here 176 cm, 83 kg will fall here, the dent in the cabinet is specific and where the man falls will be different too.
The dent in the cabinet and the location of hitting the rock correspond with Yoo Myung Woo.
Therefore, Ma Sang Tae having pushed him, would have had no idea he would die from the assault.
If Yoo Myung Woo had not attacked first, he wouldn't have pushed him.
This is the proof that Yoo Myung Woo attacked him with the wrench.
Also, he wouldn't have met Yoo Myung Woo at a place where his employees work 24 hours, if Ma Sang Tae was even a tiny bit guilty.
On that day, Shin Jung Nam wasn't there because he went to the hospital.
Yoo Myung Woo's wounds showed up in the autopsy.
They thought it was because of the fight with Seo Dong Gun, but if this is true, the story becomes different.
If he originally had plans to kill him, he probably wouldn't have brought money to buy him off.
Are we sure that the marks on the briefcase are from a wrench?
From the results, it was a wrench, and on that wrench, there were only Yoo Myung Woo's fingerprints.
Sunbae and I had talked about the possibility he had slipped.
There is a chance probability of it.
Just in case,
Prosecutor Yoon, carefully review the case.
Yes.
So, you're not going to indict him, right?
Yes.
Ma Sang Tae didn't kill Yoo Myung Woo on purpose.
It was proven that he died when he pushed him.
I also believe that President Ma Sang Tae had no intention of killing him.
Then, the time period to appeal the assault has passed, so President Ma Sang Tae becomes a free man.
And Seo In Woo's father's name will be cleared after a new trial.
Then,
I guess we have to cancel the investigation for indictment?
Yes, I ask that you do so.
You brat.
Are you happy now?
Yes.
[ORDER:
Because this case has passed the statute of limitations, no indictment will be made.]

What are you talking about?
They definitely promised to give me a loan.
They told me to come at 2, but not anymore?
I think your deferred loans had a huge impact.
The stocks keep depreciating also.
I can't get any more private loans.
It's me.
Dad!
Dad, you're saved!
What?
What do you mean?
The verdict came out as an assault.
Is that so?
So then what happens now?
Because the time period for a trial has passed, it ends here without a trial.
Okay.
I guess that's how it goes.
First,
I thought I should thank you.
Thank you so much.
Because of you, my father is saved.
I'm glad it went well.
Now, you just have to request a retrial for your dad, right?
Ah, first, you need a lawyer, but it can't be me.
A retrial case is still a criminal case, so I'll get the evidence ready.
It's alright.
We'll do it on our own, so you no longer have to worry about it.
Since you helped me, I have to help you too.
We promised to help each other.
Your father has to be shown as the true culprit only to me.
Oh, that's right.
That's right.
But still, if you need my help...
Yes.
[3rd Term Legislator Kim Ki Hwan, Past Corruption Revealed]
[[Yeonhab Times Newsflash] ST Construction Stock Price Slump]
Yes, it's not ready...
Yes.
Yes, hold on.
No, it's because I'm in a hurry.
Couldn't you do something?
What?
Yeah, what happened?
It didn't go through?
Okay.
Do you think that there could be a way?
You and me at our levels, just turn a blind eye to it.
How can I do that?
The Korean economy is bad, but even more so in construction.
Even though they combined forces, I guess it was worse than they thought.
Don't feel too guilty.
They say life is really a fight against variables, but this is something we didn't even think of.
The fact that ST can't pay.
President, the final result is nonpayment of the bill.
Why are you doing this?
I don't need you.
Where is Ma Sang Tae?
Search.
There's the second floor.
Let's go to the second floor.
He's there then.
Let go.
Mom!
Mom!
Are you okay?
Did you get hurt?
Where are the people?
Hye Ri.
Who did this?
Did you get hit?
Why didn't you say that your daughter is a prosecutor?
No, it's not like that.
This...
I didn't want them to take this.
What is this?
This is my daughter's happiness ticket.
I had to protect this.
Mom.
[Friendly In Woo]
In this kind of situation,
I'm supposed to say I'm grateful for what you're saying, right?
I'm not saying it to make you feel bad.
I know, but no thank you.
You're telling me to just watch as this happens?
Yes.
Ma Hye Ri!
Even if I accept help from everyone in the world,
I can't accept yours.
Don't you know that?
You must be busy, you don't have to worry about me.
How can you ask me to accept your help?
Due to the investigation of Ma Sang Tae by the police, it has been revealed that 15 years ago, during an argument with Ma Sang Tae,
Yoo Myung Woo died because of assault by Ma Sang Tae.
It has been acknowledged that the defendant arrived after he died.
Because of insufficient evidence that the defendant killed the victim, clearance of all charges will be granted to the defendant.
Father...
It's all over.
Good work.
Congrat-
I'm sorry.
It's perfect for couples.
What do you think?
I hear the terrace is better here.
It's a dream.
Let's go out to see it.
She's even leaving all the furniture.
What's better than that?
Here,
For the most sincere prosecutor in our bureau, Prosecutor Jin Jung Seon moving to the Chuncheon District Prosecutor's Office,
let's part without tears.
There's no such thing as that;
all separations hurt.
It's sad.
If you're sad about parting, you can't be a prosecutor.
You switch offices every two years.
My arm is going to fall off.
Chief, hurry and drink.
Sure!
Because I'm cool.
I'm not letting you off today.
Of course.
Drink slowly.
The thing about singles is that we hear about it whenever you take sides.
What is Prosecutor Yoon going to do now?
Since he can't take Prosecutor Jin's side anymore.
That's true.
Every day, you take her side several times.
Lately,
Prosecutor Ma is his ideal.
Ah, is it my time to make the drink?
Talk.
Don't have you anything to say?
What are you going to do with this house?
Wow, you're not worried about me, but the house?
Why do I have to worry about you, Sunbae?
The house is first.
Why are you worried about the house when my mom is here?
I'm... going to Chuncheon with you.
You're following me?
Yeah.
I'm going to follow you wherever you're sent to.
I'm lonely, so I don't want to live on my own.
That's right.
If you're by yourself, you're lonely.
You're very, very lonely.
Oh, Chief.
You didn't have to prepare all this.
Ah, Chuncheon, I can't wait.
Expanse of land, dalk galbi, yummy noodles...
Sunbae, how can you be excited when you should be worried?
!
Why do I have to worry?
I heard there are no handsome prosecutors in Chuncheon's district prosecutor office.
I don't look at a man's face?
You don't?
Sunbae, do you think I like you because you're good-looking?
Yeah.
This is not the time to be laughing and joking around.
Then, should I cry 'til you leave?
What are you worried about?
Bin.
You heard what mom said before.
She's following me to Chuncheon.
Aren't you worried about what's going to happen to Bin?
You're there, so why would I worry about her?
I'm worried about you.
What?
What does that mean?
Bin... is going to live with you.
I talked to your mother about it all already.
My mom?
This is weird.
It feels like we jumped over a step.
Isn't this bad?
It's no fun to do the same thing as everyone else.
Just like a puzzle, let's live like that.
Exactly.
We finally are holding hands.
It's nice.
I'm looking forward to it too.
What?
!
Oh, never mind.
I'm looking forward to it more.
Why didn't I know?
That you are cute?
It's goodbye to Jin sunbae and I guess it's goodbye to you, too.
Why are you mumbling to yourself?
No.
Why are you acting like you know me suddenly?
Because I thought I had to say bye too.
You came to the trial, but I couldn't say hi.
That...
Really, congratulations!
No...
I'm really, really glad it worked out.
Thank you.
It's nothing.
Hold on.
Be strong.
It'll work out.
Oh, we're shaking hands for the first time.
You're going?
I'm going.
[1 year later]
Oh Seok Jin, the night of April 19th, you said to Sang Jae Il, "You're dirty.
You smell so go somewhere else", right?
This character badmouthed me first.
Who are you calling "this character"?
Do you want to continue talking like that even though you're in the prosecutor's office?
He said I smelled, so I said you smell of alcohol too.
The passengers on the bus already gave statements that you didn't badmouth him first.
Because he smelled, I said that he did.
Is that a mistake?
In a bus full of people,
"You smell.
Go somewhere else.
Brat.
Rogue."
You even pushed him to get him off, but that's not a mistake?
No, but he's going to sue me because of that?
He's in our country making a living.
How can you look down on him in the century we're living in?
People from our country who are in mining, nursing, farming, construction go to Germany, the south, and other countries and work hard to kick-start the economy.
That's enough.
Isn't there a male prosecutor?
You as a woman.
You as a woman?
What I mean is...
Investigate, but why do you keep nagging?
I said all that so you can reflect on what you did wrong, but nagging?
Sang Jae Il, did you get an apology from Oh Seok Jin?
No.
If I don't cancel the lawsuit, he phoned to say he'd kill me.
Aigoo, you were threatened too!
Then on top of insulting there's threatening.
No, just because I spoke a little harshly, why are you making me into a criminal?
I'm treating you like one, because you are one.
Discrimination is a crime.
It's a crime.
Really?
Welcome.
Yes.
This "0 Calorie Cake", does this really have no calories?

It's my motto you should be happy when you eat.
You're going to eat it anyway, so it's to not say "Oh, I'm going to get fat."

President Ma Sang Tae, don't knead the dough with your wrist, but put rhythm into your body and do it.
Hey, let me bake bread too.
How long are you going to have me making dough?
It's been 30 years since I started making dough with yeast in it.
Getting good at something, comes with time?

- Mom, later.
- Later.

I will be in big trouble if I become a shopaholic again.
But this is actually more sensational.
This one!
You're number seven.
Seven?
Hye Ri...
It's not like I'm buying all seven.
I'm going to look at them and choose the best, and next month when I get the interest from my savings...
I'm going to bring it to my side.
You used to be able to buy whatever you wanted, but now you can't; it's frustrating, right?
"Humans can adapt to anything!" Ma Sang Tae.
But, did you forget all about that weird lawyer?
Lately, you don't seem to be down.
He's not someone I can or can't forget about.
Then?
Just...
He's just that person.
What now?
I arrived fine.
What good is it if you arrived safely, when I'm already bored here without you.
You're going to come soon also!
You're going to the office first, right?
Yeah.
I'm going to say hello and start work right away.
Is that all?
Welcome back.
Office Manager, Lee Jung Min.
Nice to meet you.
I'm Seo In Woo.
I've heard a lot about you.
From Jenny?
Let's work hard together.
Yes, let's.
And... these flowers came for you.
For me?
From where?
I'm not sure about that.
Invitations, dress, flowers, honeymoon...
There's so much to do.
The wedding is four months away, so work on it slowly.
There are four months left?
I think Bin is the one who's waiting for the wedding the most.
Maybe it's because your dad has already done it once, he's not at all concerned with it.
Because my dad is not doing enough, I'm sorry for you.
Bin, even you?
You are not doing enough though.
Is it everything that you were married already?
Right, you have to choose your dress.
Is it pretty?
Which one do you like the most?
Will you marry me?
What is that?
Will you live forever with me?
It's asking you to marry it.
Together, let's live happily, loving each other.
Hey!
Hey!
Long time no see.
What are you doing?
Lawyer Seo, you're very weird.
Why is your greeting like that when we haven't seen each other in a year?
"How have you been?"should be first, or "I've missed you."
You knew that I came back?
You came back?
You moved to this neighborhood?
No, then.
Hold on, where do you live?
Because you used my daughter because of me, will you disappear forever?
Why don't you stop, Prosecutor Ma Hye Ri?
What?
I don't have any plans of knowing you or spending time with you.
I'm sorry.
By any chance, if you need a friend, call me.
If you want to drink, or if you want to black out and throw up.
When you're lonely or sad, if you're sick or need someone to vent to, or if you're stressed, here's my number.
What are you doing?
I hope you become a good lawyer.
Are you joking?
I changed my number.
If you do that, you'll lose it.
I'm going.
Uh...
I want to know you again and spend time with you.
No thanks.
You'll see me again.
Even though we're done with repayment, we'll probably see each other.
We've already seen each other several times.
If we need to see each other, let's do that.
We've already seen each other many times, so if we need to see each other, let's live that way.
I won't say that you're responsible for my future, so stop giving everything up.
I won't say that you're responsible for my future, so let's just stay as is.
Stop giving everything up.
Stop playing around!
Does it look like I'm playing around?
If you're not, this is a big problem.
Then, why did you come back?
Don't pay any attention.
I didn't come back because I'm interested in you.
That isn't the case.
Oh?
Did you really forget everything?
Did you really take care of your feelings for me?
Hello?
Are things going well?
No.
Jenny, are you really his best friend?
I don't think you are.
[6 months ago]
Here... why are you here?
My God...
I came here to ask you to save In Woo, but you are dying along with him?
That... what do you mean?
Is he sick?
He's not the In Woo from before.
At his adopted father's office, he works from dawn to night.
He doesn't meet friends or play.
He doesn't meet women either.
I hate seeing him this way.
I know it's because of you, so I told him to come to Korea to see you, but he says it's not.
He says he can't.
He wanted to live in Korea.
Really?
He won't say what it is exactly, but with your family becoming like this, he felt guilty and had a hard time.
More so that he couldn't help you.
Guilty?
What a ridiculous person...
Because I wanted to know how you felt,
I dropped by on my way home from a business trip.
What do you mean?
The law firm keeps contacting me about In Woo.
He's still undecided, but if he returns to Korea, can I tell you?
Yes.
Lawyer Seo,
I think he really took care of his feelings for me.
I think he doesn't remember me anymore.
He doesn't even look at me.
There's no way.
He's doing that on purpose.
It's not like I don't know what it feels like when he does it on purpose.
Inside Seo In Woo, you're always there.
That's why I told you.
Then, there's no reason for him to act that way!
I don't know about that, but go to his house.
His house, you found out where it is?
Seo In Woo.
Hey, Seo In Woo.
In Woo, In Woo, Seo In Woo.
Wake up.
You have to go to work.

You have to go see Ma Hye Ri.

You have to go see Ma Hye Ri.
Yeah.
What are you looking at?
No, not there.
Over here.
Here.
Oh, over there.
You...
What are you doing there?
The Wonder Woman ticket's effectiveness.
What?
Look at that already.
You remember the Wonder Woman ticket, right?
That I would listen to your wish once.
I promised!
Why are you using it?
If anyone uses it, it should be me.
You didn't know?
The Wonder Woman ticket is used by the issuer.
Come out to the park by 12 tonight.
I've thrown that away long ago.
Thrown it out?
It's in your wallet.
Didn't you know?
I am a bit of a fortune teller.
Then, I'll see you later.
I'm not going.
12 o'clock.
I'm not going!
Today's the last day!
I'm not doing this anymore either!
Ah!
I forgot!
"Because it's my house."
Man!
For what reason did you cast her out?
It's not like she's far from the office.
The house is a bit tight.
What is?
When we first moved in, it was a bit small.
Humans can adapt to anything!
No, no, no.
That's not it.
It's a bit weird to live with a grown daughter.
Bring her back immediately!
I'm using the money that I earned the way I want, so who are you to say anything?
What?
Honey,
Ma Sang Tae,
I'm sorry.
No.
You're right.
You're right.
It's because I felt bad for Hye Ri!
Hye Ri and In Woo, those poor things.
They're restraining, restraining, and restraining even more.
Their insides are probably all shriveled up.
In Woo?
Seo Dong Gun's son?
Yes,
Seo Dong Gun's son, Seo In Woo.
Do you know what they are like right now?
By any chance, did you send that man into my house too?
I know how much fear you have!
It's okay...
["Wonder Woman ticket (for one use only)"]
[Ma Hye Ri will definitely grant at least one wish to Seo In Woo when he requests...]
Lawyer Seo...
Why are you living here?
!
I don't have to explain that to you.
I'm Hye Ri's dad.
The promise I made with you, President Ma Sang Tae,
I never broke it.
Really?
Yes.
If that's true, then why are you back?
Why are you living here?
What?
Hey, Seo Dong Gun's son, there's something I wasn't able to say to you.
That's why I'm here.
After doing that to your father, after getting caught,
I never apologized.
You said you were sorry.
I said I was sorry,
but I couldn't say I was wrong.
A lot,
really
I was wrong.
Eat this.
I made this bread.
Share one with Hye Ri or eat them by yourself.
I have to go.
[1.
No requests that use my position of power as a prosecutor] [2.
Has to be before 2 in the morning.
Because I need my beauty sleep...]
It's not even past 2 yet.
I caught you!
Hye Ri!
What is this?
You even got hurt!
Get on.
What?
Get on...
You, really.
You put me into a situation where I can't say no.
How can you stay here at night and not be afraid?
What would you have done if I didn't come?
If you tell me to do it again, I definitely can't.
Let's do this right.
We should have brought a camera.
Wait!
You still haven't returned my camera.
You haven't returned my watch either!
You carried this with you?
Take pictures of me.
Oh, take pictures.
I'll take your picture, but why don't you stop copying me?
Who am I copying?
I didn't take a single picture that day.
What is that?
How can you take it so suddenly?
Let's stop taking pictures separately and take them together.
I don't take pictures with just any man.
Any man?
I don't take picture with just any woman.
Oh man!
You're going to copy me until when?
I told you, I may lack originality, but my memory is amazing.
Alright, keep going then.
You probably won't be able to say the second part.
We're not lovers, and won't become lovers.
We're not friends, and not relatives.
We're nothing to each other.
Isn't that right?
Why don't you try.
We're not husband and wife and we don't know if we will be.
We're not friends or relatives.
We're nothing to each other.
Isn't that right?
Just now, you admitted to yourself that you lost.
How'd you know?
Even so, do you think I can or can't take a picture with you?
I say I don't want to, so how can you?
Like this!
Oh my.
Oh, get away.
Oh my!

Could it be heaven?
Could it be hell?
[Bad Guy]
Be quiet.
What would you do if your sister becomes the daughter-in-law of a tycoon?
Have you begun to like him?
Don't keep pushing people into a corner like that.
You started this.
Because it's not easy... to forget someone who hurt you.
[Bad Guy]
Previously on Project Runway...
You're going to be designing your own textile.
I've never designed my own fabric.
Wow.
I want one of these at home.
Oh, I love it!
I kind of had a block on this challenge.
- Unblock.
- This is getting so hard.
Emilio, you are the winner of this challenge.
Thank you.
Maya, you're in.
I don't want to be safe.
I want to win a challenge.
This was yet another simple cocktail dress.
Anthony, you're out.
Mila, which one of them will be in, and which one will be out?
I'm sorry, Cerri.
I think I'm gonna go with Kristina.
Thank you.
Cerri, I'm sorry.
That means you're out.
This is Project Runway.
The winner of Project Runway will receive a fashion spread in marie claire magazine, an opportunity to sell their line on bluefly.
Com, a $50,000 technology suite to create, design, and run their business from HP and Intel, and $100,000 from L'Oréal Paris to launch their line.
- Can I have coffee now, please?
- Sure.
Thank you, Seth.
- I know.
- You know, now that Anthony's gone, a lot of chatter, a lot of singing and a lot of jacked-up bull[bleep]
We'll be missing, meaning a lot of fun.
He had an amazing run.
A lot of people wrote him off early, but he came through.
There is six of us left.
The competition is getting more and more intense.
- [Toaster clicks]
- Mila, your toast is ready.
In the prior challenge, the judges were extremely hard on everyone.
I don't find anything intriguing about this print.
It's like a disco straitjacket.
This is a full-on catastrophe.
And so I'm stressed out just like everybody else.
But I do think my age and experience have taught me that I just have to brush myself off and move on.
I'm proud to be the youngest in the competition.
But it's a little scary sometimes, because I think everybody else has more experience than I do.
It's definitely getting harder.
I guess I haven't seen anything yet.
- Ready?
- Yep.
Let's do it.
Thank you.
- Hello.
- Hi, Heidi.
It's time for your next challenge.
It's getting harder and harder for us to decide who will go each week.
So now, more than ever, your designs must set you apart from the competition.
And with that in mind, I'm excited to tell you that you'll be designing a look for a celebrity.
This person does have a little bit of a reputation for being opinionated, headstrong, and knowing what they want.
And I'm glad that I'm not in your shoes.
Tim will be waiting for you in the workroom to fill you in on all of the details.
Good luck, and I'll see you on the runway.
Bye.
[All] Bye.
[Seth Aaron] A very, very picky, opinionated celebrity.
I'd just totally be making [bleep] up if I said I wasn't nervous.
A celebrity.
We're all excited.
Designers, I hope you're ready for this challenge.
Okay.
You'll be designing a red-carpet look for a celebrity.
Oh, yeah.
- Would you like to meet the celebrity?
- Yes.
- It's [bleep] Heidi.
- [Laughter]
Hi.
[Tim] Welcome to the workroom, Heidi.
I love being here.
You said the celebrity is opinionated and picky.
I am very, very, very opinionated and very, very, very picky.
- Yes, indeed.
- And we love that about you.
No.
But I'm very excited, because I do want you to design for me, but I also do not want you to lose your point of view as a designer.
You have to think more simple when you think about the red carpet, because it has to work from all angles.
I will not have a bump, so think of me without ze bump.
I also will show you some things
- that I've worn in the past.
- You'll have a dossier.
- Sounds good?
- [Designers] Sounds great.
I do want to be on the best-dressed list...
- That's right.
...and not on the worst-dressed list.
- Thank you, Heidi.
- [Applause]
All right.
I'm going to give you 30 minutes to sketch, then we're going shopping at Mood,
- where you'll have a budget of $300.
- Oh.
I'll be back in 30 minutes.
Thank you.
Actually, dressing Heidi Klum, not for a client, but for her, what she likes... this is a big deal.
This is one you want to win.
D You've got 30 minutes d d To make or break yourself d [laughing]
[Jonathan] Being in the bottom last challenge was such a shock to me.
I was so confident in my outfit that I have decided that I am in reverse world, and I have no idea how to be in the top unless I make something really ugly.
And the judges would probably love it.
I don't do red-carpet dresses very often, so that worries me a little bit.
But that said, she wants something that is simple and elegant, and I definitely know how to do that.
I want to do what I do best, which is volume and texture.
And it needs to have some special detail that could be captured easily by cameras.
This is paparazzi.
This is 100 flashbulbs at the same time.
This is not about being subtle.
This has to be "wow, bam" from the moment it steps off.
[Tim] Designers, may I have your attention, please?
Maya has something very important to share with you.
She and I have just had a talk.
So I've decided to leave the competition.
- No.
- No way.
Are you [bleep] crazy?
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah.
I just feel like I'm really not ready to, like, go all the way yet.
We're all completely dumbfounded.
- Wow.
- Maya, come on.
You're so close.
[Jonathan] She's made it to the final six, and she's so talented.
She really could make it to Bryant Park.
I've done a lot, but I'm not quite ready to get to that point yet, so...
In the beginning, I thought that I had really, really what it took.
And I do think I have great ideas.
But I just got out of school, and I'm feeling like
I'm not fully developed as a designer yet.
What worries me about you is that you are very referential.
It's always drawing from another designer's point of view.
The day you put a collection on the catwalk that will say "inspired by," and that will destroy you.
There's some things about my own point of view as a designer that I still need to work out.
I don't want to put myself out there when I'm not completely ready to.
And I'm having a hard time just, like, performing on command, you know?
Don't want to just see it through for one more challenge?
No.
I really think...
I really think that it's my time.
But I feel really, really happy that I've been here with you guys.
You guys have been really inspiring to me.
Well, we're desperately sorry to lose you, Maya.
Oh, my God.
I'm gonna miss you.
I'm really shocked.
I thought that she really wanted to go to Bryant Park.
[Jonathan] Perplexed.
Baffled.
None of us really understand why she's decided to leave.
[Jay] I think a lot of it has to do with her age.
To be that young and have this much pressure.
That's a cop-out.
If you're gonna leave, say, "Okay, I'm gonna design my ultimate outfit, and let them kick me out on that outfit."
- Good luck, Seth Aaron.
- Thank you.
Don't quit.
Quitters never win.
- Bye, guys.
- Bye.
[Maya] I know my limits.
I've made my decision, and I think it's time for me to go.
[Sighs]
Wow.
I never expected that.
- I never expected that.
- [Mila] I didn't, either.
[Seth Aaron] You think it was just the moment?
Like, we're right here, it's the end, and what if I do make it, and I don't know what the hell to do once I get there?
Yeah, I think so.
I think she's been feeling the pressure a lot lately.
You know, we work 18, 20 hours a day, seven days a week.
You're pretty much drained all the time.
So, you know, anybody sitting at home, saying, "Oh, my God, I can't believe Maya quit"...
You know what?
[bleep] off.
You have no clue.
Don't judge.
You come here and try it.
But at least I'm coming in alone this time.
That was a bit of a shock, yes?
- Yes.
- Yeah, that was just wow.
- Very shocking.
- Yeah.
I'm as stunned as you all are.
Yeah.
But let's rally ourselves.
I'm gonna rally you.
And let's head off to Mood, because we still have a challenge.
- Mood!
- Let's go.
All right, designers.
Don't disappoint Heidi.
No pressure.
Your 30 minutes starts now.
Something that's gonna photograph beautifully.
That looks like blush.
I want something that's gonna really make her pop.
This is beautiful.
I'm gonna look for a beautiful print that I can do my cutwork between.
I really want to do a brighter color so the judges can really see it from the runway.
Ten minutes.
This time, instead of using such high contrast materials,
I'm using gunmetal gray with gold.
You have two minutes remaining, everyone.
Okay, Mila, you just need to commit.
[Seth Aaron] You know, other people are using colors, and that really represents who they are.
But in Heidi's look book, half the dresses are black.
- Time.
- Perfect.
Come on, everyone.
Let's go back to Parsons.
Thank you, Mood.
And then there were five.
Since Maya has opted out, that leaves five of us.
It's a lot to process.
It's really hard to focus on the work, to be honest.
[Seth Aaron] How is that gonna play into the challenges?
Who's going next?
I mean, any one of us could go, including myself.
D Not d But I could.
Time to simplify.
Designers, I have an announcement.
There are five of you.
We were fully expecting for there to be six, therefore we are bringing a designer back.
All of our little worlds have just been turned upside down.
[Sighs]
Crap.
Who could it be?
Coming up on Project Runway...
- Seth Aaron.
- Yes, sir?
I need to have a word with you outside.
Uh-oh.
And the day keeps getting weirder and weirder.
Basically, like the space in between your bra.
There is no space in between the bra.
Do you just want to have a quick look?
But this reminds me a little bit of, like, curtains.
[Tim] Designers, there are five of you.
We were fully expecting for there to be six.
The stake of the competition was really hinging on the fact that there were six of us, so Maya's place will need to be filled.
Here she is, boys!
[Laughter]
I have a second chance at greatness.
Hi!
Who wants Anthony back?
But, hell, who wouldn't want Anthony back?
I like him.
You should like him, too.
We wanted to bring the last designer who was eliminated back.
And I'm very glad to be back.
All right?
So it's anyone's game.
I knew you'd figure out how to talk your way back in.
We need a level playing field, and if someone goes home, someone's injured, you know, just like in a football game, they bring someone else in.
- D Chocolate pudding d
- Chocolate pudding's glad to be back.
I'm actually really happy to have Anthony back.
You know, it's a shame to lose Maya, but Anthony is a breath of fresh air in that workroom.
I'm going to give you 30 minutes to sketch.
Then you'll be going to Mood with a budget of $300 and 30 minutes to shop.
And we will give you extra time that will correspond to the time that you've missed in the workroom
- that the other designers have had.
- All right.
So it's a make-it-work moment for you, too.
- Yes.
Thank you, Tim.
- Thanks, Anthony.
- Welcome back.
- Thank you.
I am an ambassador.
I could be the representative of second chances.
It would be wonderful if the judges have to take a deep breath and say, "Wait a minute."
However, I just don't think that my ultimate goal is to prove something to them.
This time around, the one person I need to impress is myself.
Anthony, time to go to Mood, though I'm sending you off on your own.
Tim, it won't be right if you don't say "Anthony, don't pick that."
[Both laugh]
I have to have a winning mind in order for me to make it all the way through.
I can't doubt myself.
I have to be able to show my best.
[Emilio] How's it going, Jay?
Good, so far.
[Jonathan] I can't believe that it's Heidi's challenge that we only have one day.
- You're doing your cutwork, right?
- Yeah.
Anytime I do this cutwork technique, I'm aware of how long it takes.
I'm gonna sew layers of fabric together, and then cut away at them at different levels to create an openwork filigree.
I have nine and a half hours to finish a freaking masterpiece.
The fabric is very, very drapey and kind of see-through, so my first thing is to build a fully boned understructure that will support the delicate fabric on top.
So, basically, I'm making two dresses.
I hope my dress is interesting enough.
[Seth Aaron] Mine's pretty simple.
I want to create a sleek silhouette that will teardrop onto the floor, and my fit proportion is an absolute must.
It's a busy day for me in here, let me tell you.
- Tim!
- Seth Aaron.
- Yes, sir?
- I need to have a word with you outside.
Uh-oh.
And the day just keeps getting weirder and weirder.
Today really hurt me in the way that I am able to focus on my work.
All of the events that have been happening...
I feel like it's really putting me behind.
- [Whistling] - [Mila] What's up?
Um, Valeria got offered Donna Karan.
My model's been offered a job.
Unfortunately, it takes place on runway day.
So she's going.
- Oh, she is?
- Yeah.
She took the job.
So I get Cerri.
I've never worked with Cerri.
She is not Valeria's shape, but at this stage,
I'm already so far into it, I don't know what's gonna happen.
- I's back.
- You're back.
One day to make a freaking red-carpet gown that's gotta pass the scrutiny of the judges?
[Sighs]
[Anthony] I do feel some pressure, but I cannot allow the pressure that I'm feeling to consume me.
- Designers.
- Hi, guys.
- Hi, Heidi.
- [Tim] Look who I have.
Are you guys working hard?
Yeah.
- And Miss Thing is back.
- [Tim] Yeah.
- Welcome back.
- Thank you.
I'm glad to be back, Heidi.
Heidi's going to take a look around.
What the hell?
I wanna see what you guys have been doing.
Heidi's never been in the workroom before with us here, anyways.
All the designers are sweating bullets.
- Can we have a look?
- You're kidding me.
- Hello.
- Hello.
[Emilio] Heidi is not a shy judge.
Heidi is very particular about every little detail.
I love black, obviously, but I didn't want to go black-black, so I found this great smoked black.
This looks like a short dress.
You're taking it long, right?
Oh, yeah.
I gotta fit it 'cause I have a new girl.
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.
There's nothing wrong with black... simple and long.
I feel like something has to be a little bit more somewhere.
Especially on the red carpet.
You always have to have, like, some sort of showstopper.
- Thank you, Seth Aaron.
- You're back.
- Ooh, and you're going black and white.
- Yeah.
What happens here?
Is this all gonna be, like, smooth and stuff?
Well, after the waist, it kind of just falls.
I'm not designing it to hug.
I want it to move.
- I like black and white.
- So it's potentially
- something very exciting.
- Yeah.
- What are you doing?
- What I'm creating is, like, a long mermaid.
What's beautiful about this fabric is the further away you go from it, the less you see the individual sequins.
And how do you make it go to the floor?
I have to then just seam it on the bias.
- It's gonna be very, very difficult.
- Mm-hmm.
- Which is a good thing.
- It is a good thing.
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you, Emilio.
The whole idea is to kind of, like, continue these lines below the hip, which will kind of, like, ruffle.
So you're gonna do this with this hard fabric and with the soft fabric?
Yes.
Just think about, you know, we don't want to look bigger than we are.
Think about how to do it and make her not look
- like she has...
- A big ass.
...been sitting around eating pie and cake.
[Jay] You know, this is a good thing.
At the end of the day, she's wearing this piece that I'm designing for her, so her opinion matters.
So there is the cleavage, but there is a block there.
How does that look?
It's basically, like, the space in between your bra.
There is no space in between the bra.
Do you just want a quick look?
See?
They kind of are together.
Can I just show you?
[Tim] Look at this experience you're having.
- [Laughing]
- I know.
- Hi.
How are you doing?
- Good.
Tell us, what are you doing?
Okay, so I've combined three different fabrics.
And, you know, I was toying with the idea of doing some sort of combination of these two or even three fabrics for this strap area.
Is it too simple?
It's not too simple for me.
But are the other ones better?
- Okay.
- Food for thought.
- Food for thought, for sure.
- Thank you.
I started with a color that wasn't in your dossier, but I thought would be beautiful on you, which was coral.
Oh, yeah.
I think your palette's wonderful.
- To be honest, I do like these together.
- Mm-hmm.
But this reminds me a little bit of, like, curtains.
She immediately hates the fabric that I've been working on for eight hours.
I think, like, all this twisting and this stuff is really beautiful.
I would say cut this bit off and do more with these three things.
My feeling is, if you can make this work
- in the next four hours,
- Okay.
You will be driving a very important point home to our judge about how versatile you are as a designer
- and how well you can respond.
- Yeah.
- Let's let him work.
- Exactly.
Thank you.
- [Heidi] Bye, everybody.
- [Jay] Thank you.
- [Tim] Bye, everyone.
- [Heidi] See you on the runway.
- I can't wait.
- Me, too.
There we go.
[Laughs]
Heidi mentions that she wants [high-pitched voice, accent] All sorts of drapey pieces that all lay over each other and go into the skirt and swirl around the dress.
That's a dress that would probably take about a week to make.
So, um, if I start now,
I should be done next Thursday.
[Model] Hi.
Ooh.
That's hot.
Yeah, I'm happy for her, and I'm happy I got you.
- You didn't know?
- No.
Good evening.
[Squealing]
Why is Anthony here?
'Cause, um, Maya quit.
You're kidding.
- Did you guys see that coming?
- No.
- It was just out of the blue.
- [Mutters]
Since we haven't worked together, I just need to fit this 'cause I know you're thinner through here than she is.
I have not seen Cerri.
I don't know her measurements.
Like, where her back falls or anything.
So I'm working on having to revamp something I've already started.
So I'll pull that.
This'll be pulled already.
I'm just going to go forward and hope it's enough to put me through.
- Whoo!
- Okay.
- Thank you so much, sweetie pie.
- Thank you, babe.
I'll see you tomorrow.
- Good night.
- See you.
Oh, my God.
A lot has gone down today.
People are really trying to pull out the tricks, at the same time, balancing the timeframe,
Maya's leaving, Valeria's leaving...
Oh, Lord, I'm sweating like a freaking pig here.
- [Jonathan] It's insanity in here.
- [Anthony screams]
It's definitely becoming a huge pressure cooker.
[Shouting] Where the hell is my...
Heidi's scared that I'm gonna make her butt look big.
I either need to change it or just go with my gut and just do what my original intention is.
I just have to figure it out.
If they don't give us any more time,
I don't know if there's gonna be a show tomorrow.
So, the drapey dress that I'm making for Heidi is disgusting and looks horrifying on my mannequin.
- It's do-or-die time.
- Are you making a brand-new dress?
- Yes.
- Wow.
I tear the entire thing apart, pull out any extra yardage I have.
I start a third dress.
- That's what you call... talent.
- Making it work.
I'm thinking really drapey bias-cut panels, short to show off Heidi's legs.
Hopefully Brandise is wearing a dress tomorrow.
Coming up on Project Runway...
Are you gonna be able to do it?
You have to do it.
A, it doesn't say Heidi, and B, it doesn't say red carpet.
- [Yells]
- We're going down to the runway.
I think it's just a matter of taste.
Due to all the changes, my shutdown time is 2:30.
So I was only was able to sleep for an hour, but I'm working through it.
Oh, Lord.
I'm feeling really tired and stressed, and I'm worried after Heidi's critique yesterday.
I'm definitely sweating here.
Fire.
Oh, yeah.
Everybody is a little unsure of where they are, you know?
We just don't have enough time to pull out red-carpet looks.
It's always good when we're all in the same awful, horrible sinking boat.
God be with me today.
[Chuckling]
I'm gonna take this moment to send out a special message to Miss Maya.
Thank you, and God bless you, too.
[Laughing]
[Yells]
[Yells]
I try to keep my momentum up.
I'm kind of a spastic-type person, so even me at half speed is way faster than the average person.
[Muttering]
I am feeling very, very, very, very rushed.
There is so much to do.
I am absolutely redesigning the front of my dress.
Not because I sewed it wrong, just because the interface is doing something weird, and I just do not have time to deal with it.
So life is very interesting right now.
This piece I'm making...
it's so intricate and tricky that I just have to finish it and show the judges that I can do other things besides things that I've been doing over the past challenges.
You can't go out there thinking you know anything about what they're thinking.
You go out there, present something nice and hope for the best.
[Mila] Jonathan... he started over.
He made an entire new dress last night at 11:30.
I look over, and it's just got a funky hem on it, and it doesn't really look like good draping, unfortunately.
[Sighs]
I do find some relief in seeing other designers struggling, because if I'm in the bottom, maybe somebody else's dress will tank worse than mine.
[Emilio] I'm a little behind.
I still have to do a zipper, and that always can be problematic.
I need every second I can get.
Good morning, everyone.
[Designers] Good morning, Tim.
How are you?
We are stressed for time, Mr. Tim.
[Anthony] Well, Tim, last night, I didn't get home till 2:35, and then I was back up at 5:00.
Are you gonna be able to do it?
- You have to do it.
- I have to do it, but I'm working through it.
All right, designers.
You have an hour to send your models to the L'Oréal Paris makeup room and the Garnier hair salon. red carpet, Heidi Klum.
Wow the judges.
I mean, I hate to say it, work like there's no tomorrow,
- because for one of you, there won't be.
- There won't be tomorrow.
That's right.
I'm going to send in your models.
So I want you to put this on so I can put it on the right height.
And then, while you're down getting makeup, I'll just... [whoosh]
- [Man] Not so polished?
- Yeah.
Not so polished.
It's a smoke-black tight dress with a little... with studs on it.
And it's gonna work.
Pow!
Should be good to go.
I like the look on her.
It's almost vampire-Iooking.
So we'll see how they react to that.
[Emilio] What Seth Aaron has selected...
A, it doesn't say Heidi, and B, it doesn't say red carpet.
Designers, in ten minutes, you and your models and I are going down to the runway.
- Thank you, Tim.
- Make it work.
I think Heidi's going to look amazing in my dress.
It's super sexy, sophisticated, and modern.
[Jonathan] Mila's dress fits a little strangely today.
She may have a little bit of a problem.
Designers and models, we're going down to the runway.
- Here we go.
- You look beautiful, baby.
This is so different from anything else I've put down the runway that maybe the judges will love it because they hate what I usually do.
This is it.
It's at the end.
There's six of us left, and I don't want to go home.
I think it's just a matter of taste.
Well done.
Coming up on Project Runway...
I think it is too simple.
There isn't a woman on the planet who would say
"Oh, I want people to think I have a fat butt."
We do not have a winner for this challenge.
- Hello.
- [All] Hi.
Welcome to the runway.
As you know, in fashion, one day you're in, and the next day you're out.
And then maybe the next day, you're in again.
Right, Anthony?
There are six of you here, and after tonight, there will be five.
For this challenge, we asked you to design a red-carpet look for me.
I'm looking for a design that I can wear to one of the many red-carpet events that I go to.
All right, let's meet the judges.
First, we have top American designer Michael Kors.
- Hey, guys.
- [Designers] Hi, Michael.
Fashion Director for marie claire magazine, Nina Garcia.
[Designers] Hi, Nina.
We have a surprise guest judge today who has spent a lot of time on the red carpet.
Internationally known actress and style icon, [designers gasp]
Jessica Alba.
- [Jessica] Hi, guys.
- [Designers] Hi.
Hi, I'm Jessica.
Hi.
We know.
- Nice to meet you all.
- Nice to meet you, too.
I'm so happy to be here.
I'm so happy to be on the show.
We're happy to have you.
We will score your designs as they come down the runway.
One of you will be named the winner, and one of you will be out.
Let's start the show.
There's something about me that likes to exaggerate certain areas of women.
Especially the butt area.
I guess I like big butts.
[Laughing]
I made a really nice dress, but I think that it's not as well constructed as I usually like my things to be.
But the quality of the work is there, and I think the judges are going to see that.
The gown is absolutely beautiful.
It moves.
It's not stiff.
It's refreshing.
She looks expensive.
She exceeds my expectations as she walks down the runway.
I love it.
I absolutely love the dress.
One thing I always do is look at it in awe, and then look at Heidi's face.
I can tell she's either mesmerized or she's curious.
I'm very happy.
It's just everything that I wanted it to be.
Seeing Brandise in my dress makes me feel a little bit confident and a little bit scared at the same time.
The front of the dress is appearing a little flat, but when she hits the end of the runway, and she shows the judges her back,
I can see that they're all a little bit taken by the detailing there.
This is where I need to be for this competition... spectacular, expensive, put together, polished, beautifully executed, knockout, wow moment, winner.
We're going to talk to all of you today.
One of you will be named the winner, and one of you will be out.
Seth Aaron, tell us about your red-carpet look.
I went for a more sleek, sophisticated look.
When I designed this, I thought who I was designing it for, but wanted to keep it still me.
I think you worried too much about you.
I would be more worried about making something that would be flattering for Heidi.
This almost looks like if you were at an awards ceremony, this would be the girl who actually came out and carried the statue when you won, but this isn't the winner.
I like it.
I do.
I think it's me.
Maybe I got wrapped up in who it was for... overwhelmed.
My biggest thing is this is for Heidi for the red carpet.
It just doesn't really seem like something that I've seen her in.
I think it has to have some sort of sex appeal somewhere.
Either it's the cleavage isn't done in a way that looks glorious, or I don't know where the wow effect is.
[No audible dialogue]
Anthony, tell us about your look.
I wanted to create a beautiful palette for you to accessorize, and there isn't a color palette more sophisticated than black and white if done properly.
And I most definitely think that my design today speaks to my aesthetic.
I love your dress.
Oh, Jesus.
It's very sexy, but it's not too sexy, it's not vulgar.
It's very elegant.
I love when she was walking and it flowed.
It's beautiful from all angles.
I love it.
I think it's great.
I think you're finally in your zone.
[Nina] I think it's stunning.
I think you really captured the glamour of the red carpet.
Heidi would look fantastic in it.
So would Jessica, so would many other celebrities.
And it's nice that it's like, you know, one movie on one side and another movie on the other side, depending on how you feel.
[Chuckling]
Mila, tell us about your look.
I wanted to do something sleek and sexy for you with some modern lines.
And I thought about jewelry again, 'cause I know how much you love jewelry and how many options you might have.
You know, I like this type of dress, and I wear them a lot.
I just think it might be a little too wide in the bust area.
I hate how the cups fit her.
They're spreading out to the side, and the strap's in the wrong place, so it's not doing fabulous things for the chest.
'Cause, quite honestly, if you wear this dress, it's about the cleavage.
I think it is too simple.
I feel like it is not a showstopper.
Emilio, tell us about your look.
I designed a very sophisticated silhouette, but the fabric was what inspired me.
It was like liquid gold.
'Cause it's still a metallic, but we wanted to keep the fluid lines to it.
It's impeccable.
And her hair is great with it.
Great.
It is simple, but it is sexy at the same time, and it has an amazing fit.
[Nina] This fabric could've looked really cheap, and it looks very expensive.
But very easily, it could've gone the opposite direction.
[Jessica] I think it fits like a glove.
The trick that you did that other designers do as well...
'Cause I've worn these glittery, strapless dresses.
And it's building the entire dress underneath is key.
Jay, tell us about your look.
I wanted to design a strapless short dress.
And I had in my mind I wanted to use color this time, but not too strong.
And it's a 360 experience of the same thing we see as she turns around.
The design of the corset, I think, is beautiful.
And it is impeccable.
I saw it, like, this close up.
It's just the bottom needs to have a little different something something.
If you're gonna play with volume on bottom, there isn't a woman on the planet who would say
"Oh, I want people to think I have a fat butt and big hips."
She just doesn't exist.
Can you turn around?
You have the horizontal pleating, and then you have the ruffles.
She looks wide.
She's tiny.
[Jessica] My hips are bigger after I gave birth, but I'm still trying to disguise it, personally.
I still try to wear things to keep that to a minimum.
Jonathan, tell us about your look.
I wanted to do something that was a little easier, a little sexier, maybe a little more fun.
I love short, but, boy, is this short.
I think if she even takes a big enough step, you might see her butt cheek.
It might be just a little too short.
The back of the dress...
There's something effortless about the way the back of that dress is draped.
The front looks like you were like,
"I've got ten minutes left, and I gotta jam this fabric in here!"
Did you run out of fabric?
I ran out of coral, yes.
This is the third dress.
- You made three?
- Yes.
You made three.
So this is the third version or the third dress?
The second version of this dress, the third dress.
So this really was an insane rush that we're looking at in the front.
It looks it.
The color choice for this dress makes her look waxy, plasticky.
- And it won't photograph.
- [No audible dialogue]
Okay, we've heard what you had to say.
We're gonna have a little chat, and then I'm gonna call you back.
You can leave the runway.
Thank you.
Okay, let's talk about Seth Aaron.
He just went super safe and quite boring.
No sense of surprise.
You're on the red carpet.
You want some surprise.
It looks like she was going to a funeral.
You have an insane body.
You should see that.
Let's talk about Anthony.
He was basically let go.
And then we had another designer...
Maya was her name.
It was too much stress for her, so she left.
The rules are the last person that was let go comes back.
This is a tough show to be on, but this is nothing compared to the real world.
But Anthony...
That was quite a beautiful dress that he made.
Gorgeous.
Really chic and very elegant.
[Nina] Part of the allure of that dress
- is when you walk, and there's the...
- [Michael] The leg.
- Yes, the leg,
- I like the length.
And the movement to it.
I would wear that dress.
Can I borrow it?
It's really unfortunate with Jonathan.
You know, I don't know what went wrong here.
The terribly sloppy front, which I think was so unflattering.
It really did look like just a dull pillowcase that you had bunched.
- Waxy.
Plasticky.
- Yeah, waxy.
- The color was really strange.
- The color.
It looked very amateur.
Let's talk about Jay.
If the skirt would've been fuller, in fact, it would've looked intentional.
Even these ruffles...
they need to go a different way.
Like, they should've just been going a different way completely, if he wanted volume in that skirt.
[Heidi] I said I don't want to look big.
I mean, who does?
You don't wanna be big in the thighs or big on the booty.
Not that you have, you know, a big butt.
I mean, that's the last thing you'd want.
Let's talk about Emilio.
He is the only one who knew to put the right structure
- into the dress.
- Amazing.
Look how perfect that was.
[Nina] He really worked that fabric to its best potential.
[Heidi] I like glitter, but it is the right kind of glitter.
It is not like crazy glitter.
I loved that.
What about Mila?
It looked like something that the Housewives of New Jersey would wear.
[Michael] And the cut was really so unflattering.
Not for red carpet.
It kind of seems more appropriate for a cocktail...
Go to dinner.
Go to dinner with your husband, you know.
Mila's talented, and she has great skills, but do we want to see more from her?
Have we made our decision?
All right.
Let's bring them back out.
The six of you represent the best and the worst.
One of you will be named the winner, and one of you will be out.
The six of you represent the best and the worst, and one of you will be out.
Designers, we do not have a winner for this challenge.
[Groans]
We have two winners.
Emilio, you are the winner of this challenge.
Thank you.
I absolutely adored your dress.
It was impeccable.
I really can't wait to wear it on the red carpet.
Great.
I'm looking forward to it.
Jessica, would you like to tell us who the other winner is?
I would.
Anthony, you are the other winner.
I would actually like to wear your dress,
- if, um, that's okay with you.
- [Gasps]
Girl, anytime.
Congratulations.
You can leave the runway.
Thank you again, everyone.
Come out.
Oh.
I didn't know if I could leave.
[Emilio] Four total, three consecutive wins.
This is where I wanted to be at the end of the competition.
Whoo!
[Anthony] Never in a million years did I think that
I would be invited back, only to win a challenge.
And not just any challenge.
A challenge that will allow my garment to be featured on Jessica Alba.
Oh, my God.
Wow.
Seth Aaron, you're in.
- You can leave the runway.
- Wow.
Thank you.
Mila, you're in.
- You can leave the runway.
- Thank you.
Thanks for another chance.
Jay, this was not a flattering red-carpet dress, and no woman wants to look bigger than she is.
And I warned you about that.
Jonathan, though there was some nice detail in the back, the front was a mess.
This was another effort that fell short of your talent.
Jay,
- you're in.
- Thank you.
You can leave the runway.
Which means, Jonathan, you're out.
Auf Wiedersehen.
Good luck.
Thank you.
Thank you all so much.
I appreciate everything.
Good luck.
I wish I could lie and say that I'm more surprised that I'm eliminated.
How could I ever compete with the kind of gown that Emilio created or Anthony created with a dress that I made in two hours?
- Ohh!
- [Anthony] Hey, boo!
My roommate.
I'm very excited about where I got in this competition.
Oh, my God!
This is definitely closing a chapter.
Jonathan, we are going to miss you so much.
I have to send you to the workroom to clean up your space.
No problem.
I did it.
I came here.
I kicked a little bit of ass.
Not all bad.
But I'm going home with my head held high.
Next time on Project Runway...
And then there were five.
This challenge will decide who goes to Fashion Week.
[Emilio] This is the one challenge that everyone needs to put it all out there.
Emilio just had a viewing party.
- Of course he did.
- [Laughing]
[Mila] The stakes are higher than ever.
[Tim] You need to turn up the volume.
Any direction I go in, I'm wrong.
- It's our last challenge.
- [Mila] I know.
[Sighs]
I think the pants...
we have crazy crotch.
It is a complete snooze.
[Michael] She's like a big blue condom.
Visit myLifetime.
Com to learn more about the fashion you've seen on tonight's show.
How's she doing?
No change.
Where are you guys on finding who did this?
We ran the plates that Billy called in to dispatch when she made the stop, and it turns out they were stolen.
Witnesses?
No.
None at all.
It's a traffic stop.
Routine.
She pulls some guy over, and this happens?
I --
Maybe she is cursed.
Oh, come on, Frank.
I think we're all cursed when it comes to getting shot at.
It could happen to any cop, any of us.
Yeah, but I know that this happened to her, and I'm the one that put her out there.
You kill a guy, it affects you.
She's killed three in a year.
Instead of getting stapled to a desk,
I make it so she's back in uniform.
What the hell am I thinking?
Don't.
Don't.
We got Mike's parole hearing tomorrow.
Yeah.
I got the word out.
We're gonna fill the room with cops.
The parole board's got to know that we're not gonna tolerate a cop who's gonna kill other cops out on the streets.
Okay, but listen, Frank.
If you get a chance, you got to ask the chairman for a sidebar, okay?
Just you, the hearing officer, and Mike.
It's the best way to make your case and to keep Mike in prison.
I got to go.
I'll see you tomorrow.
All right.
Yeah, I got to go, too.
Bye.
Why don't you go home?
I got two more things to do for Abby and one for you.
Then I'm going.
Okay.
How's your dad?
You know him.
He's just happy I'm not in some alley shooting up again.
I got six months already.
Huh.
Well, if you're saying the same thing in 10 years,
I'll celebrate with you.
The bug's gone, like we thought.
They must have found it.
Yeah, I just got to get this, uh, this immigration file.
Okay, let's go.
Tommy.
Is she still in there?
Paramedics said it was enough to O.D. on, but either the stuff wasn't very good, or her tissue tolerance is so high, it bought her some time.
I don't give a damn.
I trusted her, and she does this?
Frank, she's got a story.
Every junkie's got a story.
Frank, I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I don't want to hear it.
Get your stuff, and get out.
Listen, please, Frank, I didn't do this to myself.
I didn't do it.
So, what is that?
Fairy dust just magically appears?
Frank, you need to calm down and just listen to her for a minute, okay?
What?
I WA--
I was closing up, and someone grabbed me, and they --
Nobody can just walk in here.
Front door's locked, security system on -- never gonna happen.
Well, I wouldn't exactly say "nobody."
We found that bug in here two weeks ago, remember?
Which is why we changed the security codes and put in cameras.
Well, maybe that's not good enough.
I checked the surveillance tapes, and they're blank.
The whole system shut down for two hours last night.
Tommy, she knows the system.
She could shut it down herself!
Look, I get why you don't believe me.
I been lying my whole life, and I'm damn good at it.
I'm damn good at hiding it.
I hid it from everybody, so if I wanted to get high,
I sure as hell wouldn't do it here where you could catch me at it.
Come here.
All right, what do you think?
You know, if we hadn't had that breach,
I wouldn't have believed her, but now I don't know.
All right, assuming this happened -- and I'm not saying it did -- does she have any idea who?
She says her ex-boyfriend, Finn.
He works for a Russian pimp.
The guy thinks she owes him a lot of money.
Want to check him out?
Yeah.
What about Mike's parole hearing?
I'll deal with that.
Okay.
You know, maybe we should get our surveillance guy in here, do another bug sweep.
Why?
Well, it could be this attack on Iris is just to throw us off our guard.
Tommy, if they wanted to bug us again, why not just wait till she leaves?
Why bring attention to it?
I don't know.
Something about this just feels wrong.
Fine.
Bring the bug guy.
Find Finn.
Okay.
Good luck at the hearing.
Mike Bodanski used the protection of the badge to rip off drug dealers, and he was willing to kill any cop that got in his way.
I don't know what the hell else there is to know.
You tell me, Frank.
You and every other cop in that hearing room objects to Mike's being released.
So, let's hear it.
All right, fine, how about this?
You let him out, one day, Mike will kill a cop, and then I got to go to that dead cop's wife and explain that Mike could have been stopped if the parole board didn't put him back on the streets.
Sir, I understand how Frank feels about me.
I do.
I betrayed him.
I betrayed my fellow officers.
And above all, I betrayed the badge.
But I don't make any excuses for what I did.
I was wrong, but I think I have proved that I changed.
I joined Nick Babchenko's gang in here just so I could bring him down.
He was into drugs, prostitution, you name it, and all the profits were going to his father,
Yuri Babchenko, on the outside.
Now, if I was such a bad cop,
I would have just kept my mouth shut.
But with no thought to myself or my own benefit,
I chose to turn Nick in.
That's a great little speech.
All that proves is that you're a snitch and a liar and the same low-life thief that you ever were.
You let him out, every cop in this city's gonna remember you.
Sir, would you let Frank and I talk in private for a few moments?
I was thinking the exact same thing.
What do you say, Frank?
All right.
I want you to resolve this.
Take care of it.
You've got 10 minutes, or I will.
Your surveillance guy called here looking for you.
I told him you were at the parole hearing.
Did he find anything in the breakdown of security?
Yeah, he says the hard drive for the video cameras that cover the union offices is corrupted.
That's why there's no image on there.
Can he retrieve the information?
He's gonna try, and he's gonna bug-sweep your office.
Hey.
How'd the hearing go?
They said we'll know tomorrow.
I thought you were out looking for Iris' ex-pimp-boyfriend.
Yeah, I think I got a line on him.
One of his hookers is meeting me in half an hour.
What?
Look, Frank.
I got some news about Billy that you need to hear, okay?
Is she all right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's not that, okay?
What?
Preliminary tox came back on her.
She's all doped up on oxy, Frank.
I don't mean "just 'cause of her back" doped up.
I mean really doped up.
The two patrol cops who were first on the scene -- they found some things in her car.
They didn't give them to I.A. They figured you'd want to have them.
What kind of things?
This is her bottle of oxy.
The prescription ran out on it two months ago, but there's still some pills in there, which means she's probably scoring them from off the street.
They also found this.
She was smoking it?
Yeah.
Billy's a full-on junkie.
She's high, and I'm putting her back on the street?
How the hell didn't I see that?
Not just you, Frank.
None of us did.
Well, that's a different spin on her shooting, right?
What, she owes some dealer some money, he gets pissed and takes her out?
Yeah, that's where my head's at.
Got to get that to Alex and Jill.
I already asked Abby to go see Jill.
Maybe we're gonna finally get someplace with this.
Billy was smoking junk.
I'm gonna get in touch with drug squad, see who's been selling oxy.
Okay.
You know where Billy shot that guy in the clown wig?
It's an open-air market for drugs, right?
She was probably down there scoring.
Uh, looks like Frank's rubbing off on you.
Really?
I'm not so sure that's a good thing.
What's the bad part?
Frank will do anything to help a cop in trouble.
That should be a good part.
Even if it means crossing the line to do it?
You don't think that takes its toll on him?
Does it?
He doesn't really show that side of himself to me.
I doubt you see it, either.
No.
You're right, I don't.
You know, this is the first time you've spoken more than 10 words to me without being pissed off.
What are we supposed to talk about, Jill, how Frank is in bed?
No, you're just sharp, so I figured you knew about he and I.
I asked him.
He denied it, but, yes, I've known for a while.
It doesn't seem to bother you much.
It bothers me that you expect me to react in a certain way.
People's expectations of me have always been a problem, too.
Look, you and Frank were cops together, so you think you know each other better than anybody else does, which gives you a safe zone to go to.
And there's something wrong with that?
Not at all.
But Frank and I are very much alike, as well.
He knows how to work the system, make deals, read people, even manipulate them.
That's what a lawyer's all about.
Anyway, Frank and I are just circling around a relationship, and that's fine with me.
Right.
You know, you surprise me.
I thought maybe you were in love with him.
No.
No, but I know you are.
Finn?
Hey, Finn, you in here?
Listen, Finn, my name's Tommy Dunn.
I'm from the police union.
Hey, Finn!
I want to talk to you about Iris.
Come on, Finn.
I don't got all day.
Damn it, Finn!
I'm not a cop!
Don't shoot!
So this guy Finn opens up on me, hits me right in the artificial leg.
I didn't even know it.
So, from now on, that's your lucky leg.
Yeah, sure, except now I need a new one.
So, car chases you down.
You get a license?
I didn't have a chance.
This sounds like a setup to me.
I mean, some hooker tells you to come up this alley where Finn's waiting for you, and when he doesn't kill you, these guys try to run you over.
I mean -- It makes sense.
Somebody's on a mission.
Yeah, well, when I find this guy Finn, I'll be sure to ask him.
Speaking of finding guys, where are you on finding that guy that was selling oxy to Billy?
The drug squad's beating the pavement.
They're gonna let me know as soon as they find something.
All right.
You take him down, I want to be there.
Okay.
You want me to get one of our guys into the evidence locker?
Yeah, we got guns in there connected to homicides that aren't tied to any suspects.
I need one.
What for?
- Don't ask.
- Like I don't know already.
Anyway, I'm gonna hit up that same hooker who sent me after Finn.
If it was a setup, she was in on it.
Yeah, find Finn, we'll know.
Hey.
I heard someone tried to run you over.
Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm good.
Iris still here?
Yeah, she wouldn't go home, Frank.
You have no idea how much she respects you.
She would do anything for you.
What about our security guy?
He's upstairs sweeping my lawyers' offices.
And he found these bugs in my office, your office, and Tommy's office.
And he says all of our computers are embedded with spyware.
Somebody's looking over our shoulders.
All right, everybody, listen up.
There's been a security breach.
All the computers are corrupted.
I want everybody to stop what you're doing and go home.
Take your work.
Don't use your home computers.
Rent one, use your kid's, whatever.
But right now, just go home.
Okay, we're gonna get this sorted out, and somebody will be in touch.
Thank you.
I'll tell all the other floors.
Iris set me up with a new e-mail address.
Okay.
Frank.
Oh, yeah?
Where?
I'm on my way.
That was Alex.
They got a line on the dealer who was selling Billy the oxy.
You're gonna need that gun.
Oh, looky, looky what we got here, Frank.
Lots of oxy.
You're not a doctor, are you, Ray?
Why'd you shoot that cop?
She owe you money?
I don't know what you mean, man.
The cop you were selling oxy to.
I never sold nothing to no cop, okay?
All right, let's start again.
Remember the cop that shot that guy in the clown wig?
- Clown wig?
- Somebody gave you up, Ray.
You were getting robbed, and the cop shot the guy who was robbing you.
Wait, that chick was a cop?
Stop it.
You know what?
Just stop it.
You know who I am?
I'm the guy that's gonna put you out of business for good.
Look what I found.
Come on, man, that's not mine.
See, but I say that it is.
And you know what?
It's gonna turn out that this gun was used in a homicide.
Now, you can change your life right now.
You tell us why you shot that cop, this gun goes away.
All right, look, man.
Look, some guy just pulls up one day, puts a gun to my head, tells me to make sure this cop gets a steady supply of oxy.
He just drops like a thousand hits on me.
Did you see his face?
No, I didn't.
No, but I seen his car, though, man.
He was driving some silver muscle car.
Silver muscle car.
Sounds familiar.
Same kind of car that went after Tommy.
All right, man, so, this gun goes away, right?
This gun?
No.
This is your gun.
I told you,
I'm putting you out of business for good.
Come on, man, you said.
Yo, man -- You know what?
Shut up!
Just shut up!
Jill!
Jill.
Billy's awake.
I can't believe I'm alive.
Well, we're happy you are.
Who did it?
We were hoping that you could help us with that.
I don't remember very much.
You were doing radar.
You pulled over a car.
You remember that?
I think, yeah.
Whoever was in that car shot you.
I remember a sign --
"Road Ends."
I thought that was funny.
Do you remember what kind of car it was you pulled over?
I don't know.
Think color.
It was silver...
I think.
A silver muscle car.
Could you see who was inside the car?
Two men in the front.
Did you see their faces?
I don't know.
It was too quick.
All right.
That's enough for now.
You just rest.
Frank I'm alive, aren't I?
Yeah, Billy.
You're alive.
Hey.
First Billy, then Iris, then Tommy.
Somebody's coming after me by coming after people close to me.
Question is, who?
Well, you have no shortage of enemies since you took over the union, Frank.
Yeah, so who can I trust?
Well, we know you can't trust the attorney general.
He's made no bones about trying to bring you down.
What about the mayor?
You met with her.
Would she do something like this?
Yeah, I don't know about her yet.
What about the chief?
Ed?
I don't think so.
He's too much of a political animal to try and engineer something like this.
All right, well, we still got to check in to him.
He counts on me, thinking that he needs me.
Okay, well, you've got no friends in the city council, but they're pretty much useless anyway.
So, what about --
What about somebody in the business community?
There's lots of people there that hate my guts.
I'm dipping into their kickbacks from the city to pay for new cops.
Okay, so, what do you want to do about this?
All right, starting right now, everybody gets a cop on them.
Nobody else gets hurt.
I'll make some calls.
We got to find that guy Finn that was trying to take out Tommy.
I'll hit up some of our old C.I.s.
Okay, is there anything else?
Just think about it.
We've been over this, Frank.
We're gonna pull together, and we're gonna figure this out.
It takes time.
All right, well, these guys have been one step ahead of us this entire time, and that ends right now.
It's our turn.
Fine.
I got to go.
I got some paperwork to do tonight, so...
- Ok, you wanna give her a ride home?
- Sure.
No, no, that's okay.
It won't be necessary.
No, I'll take you home anyway.
Frank can lock up.
Frank, I've got my gun.
There's gonna be a patrol car outside your house.
I'll be over later.
See you tomorrow, partner.
Frank, you and I both know you can create a conspiracy out of anything.
So, what, your office being bugged -- that's just coincidence?
All right, assuming you're right, who do you think's coming after you?
Open the phone book.
Stab your finger on a page.
What are you doing about it?
Right now, I'm protecting my people.
Other than that, waiting to see who it is to show themselves.
Well, you're working on their timetable.
Maybe you ought to set out some bait, you know, spring a trap.
- Who's vulnerable that they haven't come after yet?
- No, no.
I am not putting anybody else in the line of fire.
I don't know what to tell you.
Ed, you and I have cleaned up this department, top to bottom.
We got a lot of the old-boy-brass network into early retirement.
Maybe somebody's holding a grudge.
Why don't you look into that?
Hey, you just said you didn't want to put anybody else in the line of fire.
I assume that means me, too.
I'm not asking you to do anything you wouldn't normally do as a chief.
You can't start acting differently now.
Okay.
All right, that makes sense.
I'll see what I can dig up.
Hey, I'm good.
Okay?
Yeah.
So, Wycoff came on board pretty easy, so he's either playing his usual political game, or he knows something about this.
Tough to tell right now.
Did you go over my old cases?
Yeah.
There's definitely a lot of guys that want you dead, but none of the guys had, like, the juice or the brains to put together something like this.
All right, it was a long shot, but a shot we needed to take.
Um, Frank, look, I hate to say this, but I think the way to nail these guys is to wait till they make their next move against you.
Yeah.
Yeah, no, I agree.
Meantime, we look for Finn.
Where are you on finding that hooker that set you up?
I checked in with all our old C.I.s, and no one's seen her, so she's in the wind.
As far as this Finn guy goes, no one's seen him, either.
The guy's gone underground.
All right, well, he's our best lead, so keep digging.
I'm on it.
Brings us to protection.
I'm gonna double up the backup on everybody.
There's gonna be cops the bad guys see and the ones that they don't.
You guys watch your six, okay?
Alex, can I have a word?
Sure.
What's up?
We need another meeting with Babchenko.
Mm.
I don't know, Frank.
He's still pissed at you about his son getting busted in prison.
I know.
Finn's working for a Russian pimp.
We know what Babchenko thinks of Russian guys running hookers.
We need Babchenko to help us find Finn.
That's actually a very good idea.
I can't promise you anything, but I will try.
Thanks.
All right.
Rabbi's.
When?
Okay, thanks.
That was Abby.
She just heard from the prosecutor's office.
Mike is being released from prison.
Mike got out of the prison this morning.
My son called to tell me.
Sorry about that.
Now you tell me you want me to help you find this man, uh, Finn.
He works for Russian pimps.
I know how much you hate Russian guys running girls.
I think you ask a lot for a man who has, uh... nothing to give anymore.
All right, Yuri, what do you want?
I told you what I want.
I want you to personally kill Mike, and I want to be there when you do it.
I want to make sure it is you who puts a bullet in his brain.
If you are willing to do that,
I will help you.
It won't be right away.
It needs time to be set up properly.
If you're willing to wait...
As long as I have your word that it will be done and you will do it.
You have my word.
Just getting some groceries.
Okay, yeah.
Aah!
They just shot him.
I mean, they just shot that poor cop, Frank, and it's all my fault because he was here because of me.
He was doing his job.
He knew the risks.
Did he have a family?
Oh, God.
It's not your fault.
We're gonna get the guys who did this.
You guys find witnesses?
We got the guys who called for backup canvassing.
So far, nothing.
You know, I had them, Frank.
I just forgot everything that I knew about shooting.
Shooting a target's one thing.
A man's something else.
Even cops miss all the time, Abby.
Tommy's gonna run you to the hospital.
Will you just stay here with me a minute?
Finn's in the trunk, right here.
He said they offered him 10 grand to help set up Tommy for a hit.
So far, that's all I got out of him.
Hey, Finn.
You set up my partner.
- They're gonna kill me.
- Who?
Give me a name.
I don't have a name.
You said they were gonna kill you.
Why?
They were pissed at me 'cause I didn't take out your partner, so I ran.
Who are they?
Look, I don't know.
This guy doesn't know nothing.
Okay, Frank, you go home.
Aah!
Aah!
Take a look at this.
Those two guys coming after me -- they were I.A.
That's right, I.A., and they've been busy.
Look at that.
They come after my people, then they come after me.
Thank God you stopped them.
If these photographs had ever gotten out...
Ed, open your eyes.
You see what's going on here?
What do you mean?
You remember Danny, that cop who was doing hits?
He told me he wasn't the only cop killing people for money.
Then we got cops pushing steroids.
We got vice running hookers.
Now, that's way too many bad cops walking around like they're protected.
That only happens if somebody high up on the inside's being paid off.
And what?
You think I knew about this?
All I know is the department's been infiltrated.
I don't know who or how many.
It just runs deep.
We're targets here, Frank.
Are we, Ed?
This is you and me in this photograph.
If they're coming after you today, they're gonna be coming after me tomorrow and the people around me.
I can't let that happen.
Whatever you want, you got it.
Good.
I'm counting on you for backup.
How do you want to handle this?
Well, right now, there's a couple I.A. guys out there splattered all over the road.
That's my message -- you come after me, you come after the people I love, you're dead.
Madam Mayor.
What did Ed have to say about I.A. being involved?
Exactly what you said he'd say -- that he didn't know.
Do you believe him?
Do you?
You've been trying to get rid of him for years.
Because he's inept.
But corrupt -
- I don't know.
What do you think?
I don't think that anything like this happens without somebody in the brass being involved.
There are eight deputy chiefs.
Could be any one of them.
Or more than one of them.
How did you leave it with Ed?
That I knew what was going on, department's corrupt.
Do you think he suspects you have him on your radar?
No.
If he thinks I believe him,
I need to keep him thinking that.
So, what are you gonna do?
Put an end to it.
Can I make a suggestion?
Don't do anything yet.
My people got hurt.
I can't do that.
Frank, you know better than anyone that intelligence is power.
Gather the intelligence, then you make your move.
First I need to know that you're in this with me and that I can trust you.
Yeah, you can trust me.
Will you let me in?
- You stay in the game no matter who it is.
- So do you.
All right, you're in.
Burn them down, Frank.
The last one standing is the one you want.
So, where's the big man?
Officers...
Sorry to have to tell you -- we lost two of our guys today.
Frank Leo got the message.
But he's getting too close, and we're gonna have to back off.
But I promise you this -- Frank is going down.
He won't curtail our activities because he won't be alive long enough to hurt us.
And you are gonna be a big help with that.
Welcome back, Mike.
I promised you we'd get the guys that did this to you.
We did.
How is she?
The same.
You get back inside?
Yeah.
You talk to the mayor?
She said, "Burn them all down.
The one left standing is the one you want."
You think she's involved in this?
We'll see who's left standing.
In the criminal system
Sexually based offenses are considered especially heinous.
In new york city, the dedicated detectives
Who investigate these vicious felonies Are members of an elite squad
Known as the special victims unit.
These are their stories.
Morning.
Weekend quiet, I hope.
Yeah, except the blackouts Friday night on 58.
- What the hell happened?
- Uh, friedman and sons.
Scheduled renovaon, rewiring.
Oh, yeah.
Um, cameras come back online okay?
- Tony's checking it now.
- Boss, you better see this.
- What's wrong?
- She's there.
Then the power went out.
Someone pulled her into the men's room.
Call the cops.
Special victims unit.
And let's search 58.
- Do you mind?
- Sorry.
Lady, come on!
- No evidence of a crime.
- Look at the picture.
A guy pulled a woman into the men's room.
It screamed rape.
Well, you can't have a rape without a victim.
Thanks.
We're on it.
Cleaning woman valerie martin swiped her I.D. Badge
Into the building Friday night at 6:00 p.M.,
But never swiped out.
Could she have left without using her badge?
No, she would've set off the alarm.
-What floors does valerie clean?
-This one and the one below.
I already searched 57, boss.
Check the storage room and utility closets?
- Yes, sir.
- Any unoccupied office space?
There's an empty suite, northeast corner.
Janitors use it for storage.
Rise and shine.
Valerie martin?
"martine".
You've been here all weekend.
I got roommates.
Me and hector needed some privacy.
Let's get them dressed and out of here.
All right, you two, let's go.
If that's valerie, who's this?
And where the hell is she?
So jane doe gets yanked into the 58th floor men's room.
Any video showing how she got up there?
- No record of her entering the building.
No video of her face.
No sign her anywhere.
Other than the cleaning woman,
Anybody else spd the weekend here?
All workers and visitors who entered the building
Friday morning are on record as leaving.
How we doing on the canvass?
It's before 8:00 a.M., captain.
It's gonna be a few hours until everyone's present
-And accounted for.
-Get patrol to help you out.
Hopkins, what the hell is going on here?
Richard morgan owns the building.
Police situation, sir.
There may be a crime victim missing on the premises.
I'm captain cragen.
These are detectives stabler and benson.
They're not searching without a warrant, richard.
Each of our attendants has a right to privacy.
Which we have no intention of violating, miss...
Block.
Ingrid's my chief counsel.
Runs my life.
I'm telling you, richard, if we let them Traipse through every office,
We could be in breach of our leases.
This woman is somewhere in your builng,
Maybe hurt, barely alive.
We really need your cooperation.
You got it.
What else can we do?
Puthe word out to all of your attendants
To get us the name of anybody who didn't show up for work.
Done.
Hopkins, keep me posted.
- Updates every hour.
- Yes, ma'am.
-Unit one, please repeat.
-What's up?
Csu wants you on 58.
Men's room.
Blood smears all over this wall.
Nothing on the stalls or the sink.
Or on the floor.
How did the perp manage that?
No idea.
Even if he cleaned up with bleach,
There'd still be traces of blood.
Ghosts don't bleed so she's got to be here.
You got a bloody victim,
Five minutes of blackout to get rid of her.
What's the quickest way out?
Service elevators in the trash room Down the hall.
These elevators have a camera?
Yeah, they weren't affected by the power shutdown.
We checked the video, didn't see our perp Or the victim.
- Any cameras in the stairwell?
- No.
They're never used.
Could he have gotten out this way without setting off the alarm?
- Sure.
If he knew the combination.
-Ready when you are.
- Do it.
Floors look clean.
Walls.
There's something on the trash can.
Yeah, we got blood inside.
When and where does the trash go out?
The dumpster's out by the loading dock
Right about now.
Hey, hey, hey!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Stop that thing!
Hey, hey, drop it!
Drop it!
Police!
Did you find anything?
- Check it out.
- Bloody paper towels.
He must've used it to clean up the bathroom.
Everybody grab a dumpster.
Whoa.
Don't even bother.
Oh, god.
Wrapped her up nice and tight.
Hope he left trace evidence inside for warner.
Csu combed the dumpsters.
Nothing other than the corpse.
How did the perp get into the men's room Without being seen?
Well, it had to be during the first blackout,
Which means he knew when the 58th floor Was going to go dark.
Victim walks down the hallway.
He pulls her in a split second before blackout number two.
Timing is too precise to be a random grab.
He must've known her and lured her there.
Then what?
- He bashed her head in.
That explains the blood on the bathroom wall.
He laid down plastic
So her blood wouldn't get on the floor.
Then he wraps her up.
He wipes up the blood.
Drags her down this hallway into the trash room.
He knew the blackout schedule,
When the garbage got picked up, and his escape route.
Had to be an inside job.
We're interviewing all the maintenance And security employees.
It's amazing he pulled it off.
- What's even more amazing, it happened before.
- When?
- October, 1987.
Nancy pierce, 27.
Raped, strangled, and left to decompose in an air vent
Two blocks away at trent towers.
- Perp got away with it?
- The perp got popped.
Daniel hardy, maintenance man at trent towers.
Doing the full monty at sing sing for nancy's murder.
So he's been in prison for 2 decades.
Can't be the same guy.
Unless he had an accomplice we never collared.
Hopefully, jane doe will tell us more
When she's unwrapped.
Any word from warner?
She said she's swamped.
It's gonna be a few hours.
Well, take a good book to the m.E.'s, john.
Liv, elliot, head up to sing sing.
See if mr.
Hardy had help murdering nancy pierce.
Sing sing Prison Monday, December 14
I didn't have a partner because I didn't kill nancy.
You're eligible for parole in three years.
Now, the board could let you go you come clean.
I'm not gonna admit to what I didn't do.
Then why won't you look at her?
- Because I loved her and she loved me.
Until she didn't anymore.
So you raped her and choked her to death.
They found semen inside her at matched your blood type.
Except it wasn't mine.
I was convicted before there was dna.
Take a swab from me.
Compare it.
It's not our job.
Call your lawyer.
Really.
My lawyer gave up after the supreme court ruled
We didn't have the right to demand dna tests
To prove our innocence.
If I raped nancy, if I killed her,
Then why would I ask you to do this?
Here you go.
We find the dna from nancy pierce's murder, We should run it.
'cause you think hardy's innocent?
Because I once put an innocent man Away in prison...
Before we had dna.
Benson.
Liv, warner's unwrapping jane doe now.
We'll send you a photograph.
She's got head trauma and a wide ligature on her neck.
- Do you recognize her?
- Renee simmons.
She was a secretary In mr.
Morgan's accounting department.
And why didn't you report her missing?
Because she wasn't.
She wasn't speaking to you, counselor.
I laid off renee And 12 others Friday morning.
We... we collected their id badges and swiped them out.
They, uh... they all left the building immediately.
Is there a reason renee would come back Friday night?
Clean out her office?
- We did it for her.
- I'll handle this, ingrid.
You don't have to answer to them.
- Ingrid, please.
Renee is dead.
- We're gonna need to speak with her coworkers.
Maybe one of them knows who did this.
- Well, anyone who knew renee knows who did this.
Her husband matt simmons.
Guy went nuts after she divorced him.
-What do you mean "nuts"?
- Enough for an order of protection.
But we couldn't legally keep him out of the building.
He works for friedman and sons as a stockbroker On the 58th floor.
Simmons didn't swipe out.
Well, if renee left the building After being laid off,
How'd her ex get her back in without being seen?
Let's ask him.
Hey, matt!
Got a sec?
Hey, what are you doing?
Where you going?
He's closed.
Weed.
Felony weight.
At least 8 ounces.
No wonder you had the munchies.
Please.
Cut me a break on the weed, man.
The s.E.C. Will yank my trading license.
License?
Your... your whole life's about to go up in smoke, pal.
Renee?
Oh, my god.
Was... was she the one that was killed On the 58th floor?
You should know.
Medical examiner says you bashed her head in And strangled her.
- No.
I didn't...
I didn't do that.
- Yeah, you did.
You wrapped her up, hauled her down the steps,
And dumped her like some trash.
- I-I-I didn't...
I didn't kill renee.
I swear.
- This is your big chance.
You knew they were going to cut the power
To your office and you knew she got laid off.
You knew she needed money.
Is that how you lured her back, matt?
Offer to give her some?
Had to creep in through the loading dock.
Walk up all those steps to the 58th
Where you snatched her in the men's bathroom.
Please.
Why would I kill her?
The same reason she got a restraining order against you.
-You're obsessed.
- I was pissed.
She... she was banging that sleazeball boss of hers, Morgan.
Richard morgan.
How do you know that?
I followed them.
Lunch at the same hotel every Tuesday.
What they were eating wasn't on any menu.
I wanted renee out of my life.
But not like this.
- Richard morgan, 56.
Ceo of richmore investments.
15 years on the fortune 500.
Big philanthropist.
Martial arts enthusiast.
He teaches karate to underprivileged kids.
Also a tenant at trent towers in 1987
When nancy pierce was murdered there.
Same m.O. As renee simmons.
Same murder weapon.
Ligature marks are identical.
22 years between murders is a long time.
If morgan is our guy, why no similar killings?
Maybe he just didn't need to.
Or we haven't found his other victims yet.
We think he was screwing nancy way back when?
He was having an affair with renee simmons.
He could have killed them both to cover up his dalliances.
Or some other secret they learned during pillow talk.
And daniel hardy takes the fall.
Anything in nancy pierce's case file that can help us?
There are vouchers for blood and semen From her body.
Got the property clerk looking for them now.
Well, I meant anything that could help us suss out
Morgan's motive for killing nancy.
Well, according to morgan's testimony at hardy's trial,
It was all hardy.
Let's see. "daniel hardy had the master keys to the building".
Daniel hardy had a temper".
Ah.
Listen to this one.
"that night, I saw hardy yelling at nancy in the hallway.
Next thing any of us knew, she had disappeared".
Morgan was master of the universe.
I was a slave.
A nobody.
-I still am.
- Okay.
Nancy.
She was an accountant?
She was a junior partner at a small firm.
Around the time she disappeared,
Did she seem nervous?
No.
The opposite.
She was... she was excited.
She... she... she tells me she's gonna pay for me To go to college.
She was gonna buy an apartment.
She was gonna be rich.
How rich?
Half a million bucks.
From morgan.
He was gonna buy out her firm.
Nancy was gonna take her piece of the action and quit.
He flipped out.
Said she had to stay on to get the money.
And the next day,
Goes back to the office to get her stuff.
And then Sunday...
They find her dead.
Nancy was murdered Friday, October 23, 1987.
That was four days after the stock market crashed On black Monday.
Now the market tanks again.
Any cat with morgan's kind of scratch Must've taken a bath.
Well, that's reason to lay people off, Not motive to murder two women.
Not if he had something to hide That both women knew about.
- Like his money.
- What do you got?
Richard morgan's broke.
Morgan's books show investments totaling Almost 800 million bucks,
But all his accessible bank accounts Show that he only has $5 million on deposit.
So he would've been wiped out If one of his big clients cashed out.
Or a bunch of smaller ones.
We called some of them.
Morgan's been stalling on paying them back.
It sounds like he went to the bernie madoff School of investing.
Makes sense to me.
That's more than enough motive to murder nancy pierce And renee simmons.
- They both worked in accounting.
They both had access to his books.
They must've stumbled onto his ponzi scheme.
- Renee didn't just stumble onto it.
Buddy at the irs says she was their informant.
He found out.
He whacked her.
And he tried to blame it on the ex.
Old habits die hard.
And two women paid with their lives.
This guy knows we're onto him, he's gonna skip town.
Not if we clip his wings first.
Guy shows me the yacht he buys with his bailout bonus.
You know what he says, "your tax dollars at work".
- I'm done with you guys harassing my client.
- We've only just started.
- Stand up, mr.
Morgan.
You're under arrest for fraud and grand larceny.
You're ruining his reputation.
Save it for arraignment, counselor.
It'll all work out.
Excuse me.
Arraignment Court Monday, December 21
- Docket ending 245, people v. Richard morgan.
-Charges are...
- is this right?
230 counts each grand larceny and fraud In the first degree and 20 counts
Of income tax evasion?
- Your honor, you're looking at bernard madoff,
The karate kid edition.
That's prejudicial, judge.
I want her censured.
- I don't see any jury here, miss block.
And she certainly isn't going to prejudice me.
How do you plead, mr.
Morgan?
Not guilty.
The defend has a private plane and ample means To flee the country.
We request remand to rikers.
Remand is excessive.
My client wasn't charged with a violent crime.
Yet.
Mr. Morgan is also being investigated For rape and murder.
And when he's charged with either of those, He'll await trial in rikers.
The defendant will surrender his passport
And be confined to his home With an electronic monitoring device.
Bail is denied.
We're in recess.
Press is staked out at every exit.
News travels fast.
- Well, you're not kidding.
The u.S. Attorney called.
They're indicting tomorrow.
- Well, if we're gonna get morgan on those murders,
It's now or never.
- You're wasting my client's time.
Well, your client better get used To having a lot of time on his hands.
That's not all he hands on his hands though, is it?
Is something about this funny?
- Well, I was just thinking about your accusation
That I bilked my clients Out of hundreds of millions of dollars.
You don't seem too sorry Considering you ruined a lot of lives.
Including the poor bastard who's sitting in prison
For the murder you committed 22 years ago.
- As memory serves, daniel hardy was convicted
By a jury of his peers.
- That's interesting that you remember his name.
- I don't know what you mean.
- If you had dna to prove any of this,
We wouldn't be having this little chat.
Unless you're going to arrest my client again,
He's going home.
- I am going to get daniel hardy out of prison
And make sure he takes every cent that you have left.
- Good luck on your hamster wheel.
Shall we?
- That bastard will do anything to protect his money.
- Even the ice princess can't get him out of this.
You ruined me!
Drop the gun!
Drop it, now!
Okay, calm down, sir.
Get against the wall.
Get against the wall.
- All right.
Okay.
- Both hands on the wall.
- No pulse.
- What the hell happened?
We were taking morgan out
When the old geezer got off the elevator and shot him.
He stole everything from me.
All I've worked for my whole life is gone.
You okay?
I'm fine.
- I heard him before I saw him.
He pointed the gun right at me
And then he fired twice.
I saw the blood on me and thought I was hit.
- Well, that's, uh, that's really all I need from you.
Is there... is there somebody that I can call To take you home?
No.
Thank you.
I'm sorry about your client.
The guy's name is thomas rooney.
80 years old.
Wife recently died of cancer.
Morgan would not give him his money back.
Said he had nothing left to lose.
- How did he know that morgan was here?
El, property clerk on 2.
Yeah.
Stabler.
I've got vouchers that say it is there.
Well, did... okay.
Yeah.
Thanks.
Dna from the nancy pierce case is gone.
Which means daniel hardy Is now officially, eternally screwed.
He's staying in prison for the rest Of his miserable life.
- Miss block!
Miss block.
- Everything okay?
- Yes.
I'm sorry.
Um, I realized I just need to ask you a few more questions.
So if you don't mind.
- I've told you everything about the shooting.
- This isn't about the shooting.
This is about the pictures of the two women That your client murdered.
I saw how disturbed you were by the photos, counselor.
And yet, when your boss of 25 years gets murdered
In cold blood right in front of you,
You seem relieved.
Why is that?
I don't know.
Yes, you do.
You've known all along.
- I don't know what you want me to tell you.
I just want the truth.
Did you help richard morgan carry out his ponzi scheme?
- Absolutely not.
- Did you know about it?
No.
I had suspicions.
But I was his lawyer.
And attorney-client privilege forbade me
From revealing anything richard ever said to me.
- That bastard stole millions of dollars.
He killed two women.
- He never told me he planned to kill anyone.
- Come on, liv, ask her about hardy.
I'm gonna wring it out of that bitch.
- Hold on, elliot.
You're not going anywhere.
What do you want from me?
- Something that will help us free daniel hardy.
I can't help you with that.
Well, you are his only chance.
Thomas rooney made sure of that when he murdered your boss.
- I have a duty to preserve my client's confidentiality.
He's dead.
- The law says it doesn't matter.
- Richard morgan let an innocent man
Take the fall for a murder that he committed.
- I took an th.
- You're protecting a corpse!
My life was protecti him.
Don't you understand?
If I betray him now,
I betray everything I've stood for!
Ingrid.
Morgan's gone.
You don't have to cover for him any more.
An innocent man is going to spend the rest of his life
In prison
Unless you step up.
- I realized richard murdered renee simmons
On Friday afternoon
After he did it.
Because he told you?
He didn't have to.
But I knew.
Because I knew 22 years ago,
He murdered nancy pierce.
How did you know?
- Have you ever seen a shadow box?
- Sure.
A small display case that you hang on the wall.
- Richard had one in his office.
It held every karate belt he'd ever earned.
- I didn't see that in his office the other day.
- Because last Friday afternoon,
Richard brought it to my office
And asked if I could hold on to it for awhile.
- After he murdered renee simmons.
So you're saying that richard morgan
Did the exact same thing 22 years ago in trent towers.
- Richard brought me the shadow box that day too.
Said he was renovating
And asked if he could leave it with me.
Were all in sho when nancy's body was found
D richard was busy with his "renovation".
It got me thinking.
I knew he just bought out nancy's accounting firm
And at she wanted to leave.
It didn't take a genius to put t and two together.
So several days later,
I asked him if he had anything to do With nancy's murder.
And he said
"as a matter ofact, yes".
I pleaded with him.
I told him "richard, dan hardy, a maintenance guy,
Is going to jail for killing her".
Do you know what he did?
He giggled and said "I know.
Isn't it great?"
So all these years...
You've known...
That daniel hardy's an innocent man.
- There isn't a day that goes by
That I haven't thought about that poor man.
Yeah, boo-hoo-hoo.
She let him rot in prison for two decades.
What the hell is wrong with her?
If she had come forward,
She would've been disbarred, maybe gone to prison.
For providing evidence
That would set a wrongfully accused man free?
- Only massachusetts allows an attorney to break privilege
He or she knows of actual innocence.
And since privilege doesn't die with the client,
E just committed career suicide.
- So what did you with the box
After you realed why morg gave it to you
The first time?
- I went home.
I couldn't sleep.
The next day when I me into t office,
It was gone.
When I went to see richard,
It was already back on his wall.
And now?
Is it still in your office?
- Yes.
In the back of the credenza
Behind my desk.
He wasn't lying.
I found nancy's epithelial cells
All over t belt anmorgan's.
- Arrogant bastard didn't even clean it up.
He just hung it back on s ll like he was untouchable.
Lucky for us.
Lucky for us ingrid block cleared her conscience
She dius a huge solid.
- Yeah, years too late.
- There'more.
I found renee mmons' dna and blood on the belt too.
- That's why the ligature mark looked the same as nancy's.
The son of a bitch used the same belt
To murder both women.
- And now we have bulletproof evidence
That morgan killed nancy and daniel hardy did not.
- You want to tell me what's going on?
- You're getting out, daniel.
- That simple?
It's over?
- Richard morgan.
He killed nancy.
Richard morgan.
Are you sure about that?
Both their dna was on the karate belt
That he used to strangle her.
Belt from his office?
How'd you found out?
Because I gave it to them.
You?
You're morgan's attorney.
- Until he was killed two nights ago.
- Did you know richd killed nancy?
Did you know...
That richard killed nancy?
You knew.
You knew and you didn't say anything.
- The law says I couldn't.
- The law?
You had that power to get me out 20 years ago
And you didn't say anything?
You let me sit here?
How do you live with yourself?
20 years!
Let's go.
- The english judge william blackstone said
"better that ten guilty persons escape
Than one innocent suffer".
I am sad to say that in this case,
Our system fell far short of that standard.
- This court can never repay you
The years you were wrongfully imprisoned.
I can only apologize
For this gross miscarriage of justice
Which made you a victim.
That said, daniel hardy,
I am hereby setting aside your conviction
Of murder in the second degree.
I order your record expunged and your immediate release
From custody of the state department of corrections.
We are adjourned.
Thank you for everything.
- I just wish there was more we could do.
- There is.
Ingrid block.
Detective stabler.
- You're under arrest for facilitating a murder.
Elliot, what are you doing?
- I'm getting justice for renee simmons.
She put the murder weapon right back
In richard morgan's hands.
- So do you understand your rights
As I've explained them to you?
- I've already told you everything I know
And I'll act as my own attorney.
- Well, if I were you, I'd hire someone more ethical.
- Detective stabler, please understand...
- You can save that for a jury.
- Do you have any idea what you've just done?
Job I was hired to do.
- You didn't clear this arrest with me or alex.
You didn't even tell your partner.
- I followed the law.
- We're not finished, detective.
Though you're awfully close.
- Captain, it was a good collar.
I read the facilitation statute.
- Proof that a little knowledge is a dangerous thing.
- Morgan gave his lawyer the black belt
He used to strangle his first victim.
E returned it to him.
Which she had a legal right to do
To preserve attorney-client privilege.
- Ingrid block knew morgan had killed once.
She knew he was capable of doing it again.
When she handed that belt back to him,
She facilitated renee simmons' murder.
- I am tired of defense attorneys
Hiding behind privilege to withhold evidence.
Supreme Court Tuesday, January 19
Miss block told us that in 1987,
Mr. Morgan confessed to her
That he had strangled nancy pierce
With the, uh, black belt from this box.
- And how do you know mr.
Morgan later killed miss simmons
With the same black belt?
- His dna was on the belt with both victims.
- Thank you, detective.
Nothing further.
- Detective stabler, who is this man?
-Objection.
-Goes to the witness' credibility.
Overruled.
Answer the question, detective.
That is victor tate.
I arrested him in 1998 for rape.
Did you later learn he did not commit that crime?
Yes.
- Where is victor tate now, detective?
- He's serving out his sentence in sing sing.
- How is that possible if he's innocent?
- The only man that can prove he is innocent, The real rapist... committed suicide.
While in police custody.
So an innocent man remains in prison
Even though you did your job.
Yes.
Detective stabler,
Do you believe I'm responsible for leaving daniel hardy
- In prison?
- Ye I do.
- But that's not the only reason you arrested me.
You did it to assuage your own guilt
About victor tate, correct?
- Objection.
- Withdrawn.
Nothing further.
As a lawyer, I took an oath
Never to reveal a client's secrets.
This trust is so sacred it is protected by law.
Which means that if you,
You, or you are ever arrested,
You can be sure I will maintain your confidentiality.
Attorney-client privilege is a fundamental basis
To your right to a fair trial.
Richard morgan gave this shadow box to me in 1987
And admitted using the black belt
To strangle nancy pierce because he knew
I couldn't tell the police.
I agonized about it.
I knew I couldn't keep this
Because I'd be guilty of obstructing justice
By concealing evidence.
My only legal option
Was to give it back.
But before I could,
The shadow box disappeared from my office.
To this day, I have no idea how richard got it back.
Your witness.
So...
The belts were stolen
And magically reappeared on richard morgan's office wall.
Did you ask him how it happened?
- Yes.
He wouldn't tell me.
- But, of course, you have no way to prove this,
Do you, because your only corroborating witness
Is richard morgan and he's dead, correct?
- I'm telling the truth.
- Really?
Because you just told this court
You had a sacred duty to protect client confidentiality,
Which you violated, did you not?
- To get an innocent man out of prison.
- If you were so concerned about daniel hardy,
Why didn't you come forward 22 years ago?
Every day...
I wanted to come forward.
A wrongfully convicted man sat in prison
Because of my actions.
- Until you decided to break your oath.
And you did break it, didn't you?
Richard was dead.
There was no way my revelations could hurt him.
- So which is it, keep the oath, break the oath,
Keep the belts, give the belts back?
I told you...
They disappeared from my office.
- And into richard morgan's hands.
He used this black belt to murder renee simmons.
You're right.
I should've stopped him.
It's my fault.
Renee simmons' murder is my fault.
No more questions.
- You really took her apart in there.
- I'll take that as a compliment.
Alex... this is wrong.
Am I missing something?
The only reason we're in that courtroom
Is because you arrested ingrid block.
I think I made a mistake.
I want you to drop the charges.
- Too late.
Mccoy certainly won't let me.
And after what I just did in there,
The jury has no choice but to convict.
Unless I give them one.
- If I didn't owe you one, I'd never let you bring me back.
Why are we here?
- The guy with his back to us.
- What about him?
- He's you.
- What are you talking about?
- His name is victor tate.
I collared him 11 years ago for rape.
Last year, I found out he didn't do it.
I screwed up.
He's gonna be serving out his sentence.
- Nothing you can do for him?
- No.
But you can for ingrid block.
You want me to help her?
Do you remember richard's karate belts?
What about them?
- I don't think ingrid gave them back to richard
After nancy's murder.
Someone with access to her office did.
- Block stole 22 years of my life.
- Revenge isn't gonna get them back.
- Helping that bitch gonna get him out?
What do you care?
- Her hands were tied by the law.
Listen, man, she should be punished For what she did to me.
- Richard morgan put you in here.
He's the one who stole those years from you.
Now, if ingrid block hadn't come forward,
That'd be you.
You'd be pushing a mop for the rest of your life.
- Wednesday, October 28, 1987
Was my first day back to work
After my girlfriend nancy pierce's funeral.
As soon as I came in, I got a call from mr.
Morgan.
What did he want?
- He asked me to take the shadow box
Out of your office and put it back up on his wall.
Why would he send you?
I was a building maintenance man.
I had a master key.
Did you carry out his request?
Yes, I did.
- Why didn't you telme what you'd done?
- Mr. Morgan said if I did, he'd fire me.
- You didn't think that was unusual?
- When mr.
Morgan asked, I delivered.
- What did he do when you brought the box
-Back to him?
-He smiled.
And then said "when you've got a black belt,
You can do anything".
The next thing I know,
I'm being arrested for nancy's murder.
- Thank you.
Nothing further.
- No questions for this witness.
The defense rests.
- Mr. Hardy, you may step down.
Rebuttal, miss cabot.
- None, your honor.
- Then the defense moves for a directed verdict
Of not guilty on the grounds the people have not proven
Beyond reasonable doubt
I facilitated the murder of renee simmons.
- As reluctant as I am to take this decision
Away from the jury,
It's clear that the defendant had absolutely no intent
To commit a crime.
And for the record,
It is abhorrent to me
That a district attorney
Would so blatantly use our system of justice
As a means to a political end.
The defendant will rise.
Ingrid block, I find you not guilty
In facilitating a murder.
This court is adjourned.
- I owe you an apology, counselor.
- And I owe all of you thanks.
Uh, miss cabot, I represent thomas rooney
On his murder charge.
He's 80 years old.
He's sick.
Any way you can plead him out?
I'll see what I can do.
- Ingrid's a glutton for punishment
Defending the guy who murdered her boss.
- I get it.
It's her way of helping one of morgan's victims.
- If it were me, I'd move on.
- Maybe she's grateful to rooney
For taking the monkey off her back.
- Or she has a guilty conscience.
You called rooney two hours before he murdered morgan.
- You told him that morgan was here, didn't you?
Did you tell rooney to kill him too?
- No.
I just told him where richard would be.
But you knew he was ready to explode.
You just lit the fuse.
- All I did was make a phone call.
- Knowing that we'd never be able to touch you.
Thomas rooney did
What I should've done 22 years ago.
I always hoped the law would catch up with richard.
- The law doesn't always guarantee justice.
But this time I did.
NARRATOR:
In the criminal justice system, sexually based offenses are considered especially heinous,
In New York City, the dedicated detectives who investigate these vicious felonies are members of an elite squad known as the Special Victims Unit,
These are their stories,
Morning.
Weekend quiet, I hope.
Yep, except the blackouts Friday night on 58.
What the hell happened?
Friedman and Sons.
Scheduled renovation rewiring.
Oh, yeah.
Cameras come back online okay?
Tony's checking it now.
Boss, you better see this.
What's wrong?
She's there.
Then the power went out.
Someone pulled her into the men's room.
Call the cops, Special Victims Unit, and let's search 58.
Hey, do you mind?
Sorry.
Lady, come on!
No evidence of a crime.
Look at the picture.
A guy pulled a woman into the men's room.
It screamed rape.
Well, you can't have a rape without a victim.
Thanks.
We're on it.
Cleaning woman, Valerie Martin, swiped her lD badge into the building
Friday night at 6:00 p.m. but never swiped out.
Okay, could she have left without using her badge?
No, she would have set off the alarm.
What floors does Valerie clean?
This one and the one below.
Already searched 57, boss.
You check the storage rooms and utility closets?
Yes, sir.
Any unoccupied office space?
There's an empty suite, northeast corner.
Janitors use it for storage.
Ready?
(VALERlE moaning)
STABLER:
Rise and shine.
(VALERlE GASPS)
Valerie Martin?
Martin.
You've been here all weekend.
I got roommates.
Me and Hector needed some privacy.
Let's get them dressed and out of here.
TONY:
All right, you two, let's go.
If that's Valerie, who's this?
STABLER:
And where the hell is she?
So Jane Doe gets yanked into the 58th floor men's room.
Any video showing how she got up there?
No record of her entering the building.
No video of her face.
No sign of her anywhere.
Other than the cleaning woman, anybody else spend the weekend here?
All workers and visitors who entered the building Friday morning are on record as leaving.
How we doing on the canvass?
Before 8:00 a.m., Captain.
It's going to be a few hours until everyone's present and accounted for.
Get patrol to help you out.
Hopkins, what the hell is going on here?
Richard Morgan, owns the building.
Police situation, sir.
There may be a crime victim missing on the premises.
I'm Captain Cragen.
These are Detectives Stabler and Benson.
They're not searching without a warrant, Richard.
Each of our tenants has a right to privacy.
Which we have no intention of violating, Ms...
Block.
Ingrid's my chief counsel.
Runs my life.
I'm telling you, Richard, if we let them traipse through every office, we could be in breach of our leases.
Mmm-hmm.
This woman is somewhere in your building.
Maybe hurt, barely alive.
We really need your cooperation.
You got it.
What else can we do?
Put the word out to all of your tenants to get us the name of anybody who didn't show up for work.
Done.
Hopkins, keep me posted.
Updates every hour.
Yes, ma'am.
Unit one, please repeat.
What's up?
CSU wants you on 58.
Men's room.
Blood smears all over this wall.
Nothing on the stalls or the sink.
Or on the floor.
How did the perp manage that?
No idea.
Even if he cleaned up with bleach, there'd still be traces of blood.
Ghosts don't bleed, so she's got to be here.
Now you've got a bloody victim, five minutes of blackout to get rid of her.
What's the quickest way out?
Service elevators in the trash room down the hall.
These elevators have a camera?
Yeah.
They weren't affected by the power shutdown.
We checked the video.
Didn't see our perp or the victim.
Any cameras in the stairwell?
Nope, they're never used.
Could he have gotten her out this way without setting off the alarm?
Sure, if he knew the combination.
Ready when you are.
Do it.
Floors look clean.
Walls.
There's something on the trash can.
Yeah, we've got blood inside.
When and where does the trash go out?
The dumpsters out by the loading dock.
Right about now.
fin:
Hey, hey!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Stop that thing!
Hey, hey!
Drop it!
Drop it!
Police!
BENSON:
You find anything?
Check it out.
Bloody paper towels.
Must have used it to clean up the bathroom.
Everybody grab a dumpster.
fin:
Whoa.
Don't even bother.
Oh, God.
(EXHALES)
Wrapped her up nice and tight.
Hope he left trace evidence inside for Warner.
CSU combed the dumpsters.
Nothing other than the corpse.
How did the perp get into the men's room without being seen?
Well, it had to be during the first blackout, which means he knew when the 58th floor was going to go dark.
Victim walks down the hallway.
He pulls her in a split second before blackout number two.
The timing is too precise to be a random grab.
He must have known her and lured her there.
Then what?
He bashed her head in.
That explains the blood on the bathroom wall.
He laid down plastic so her blood wouldn't get on the floor.
Then he wraps her up.
He wipes up the blood.
Drags her down this hallway into the trash room.
He knew the blackout schedule, when the garbage got picked up, and his escape route.
Had to be an inside job.
We're interviewing all the maintenance and security employees.
It's amazing he pulled it off.
What's even more amazing, it happened before.
When?
October 1987.
Nancy Pierce, 27.
Raped, strangled, and left to decompose in an air vent two blocks away at Trent Towers.
Perp got away with it?
Perp got popped.
Daniel Hardy, maintenance man at Trent Towers, doing the full monty at Sing Sing for Nancy's murder.
So he's been in prison for two decades.
Can't be the same guy.
Unless he had an accomplice we never collared.
Well, hopefully, Jane Doe will tell us more when she's unwrapped.
Any word from Warner?
She said she's swamped.
It's going to be a few hours.
Well, take a good book to the M.E.'s, John.
Liv, Elliot, head up to Sing Sing.
See if Mr. Hardy had help murdering Nancy Pierce.
I didn't have a partner, because I didn't kill Nancy.
STABLER:
You're eligible for parole in three years.
Now, the board could let you go, you come clean.
I'm not going to admit to what I didn't do.
Then why won't you look at her?
Because I loved her.
And she loved me.
BENSON:
Until she didn't anymore.
So you raped her and choked her to death.
They found semen inside her that matched your blood type.
Except it wasn't mine.
I was convicted before there was DNA.
Take a swab from me.
Compare it.
It's not our job.
Call your lawyer.
Really?
My lawyer gave up after the Supreme Court ruled we didn't have the right to demand DNA tests to prove our innocence.
If I raped Nancy, if I killed her, then why would I ask you to do this?
CLERK:
Here you go.
If we find the DNA from Nancy Pierce's murder, we should run it.
Because you think Hardy's innocent?
(CELL PHONE ringing)
Because I once put an innocent man away in prison before we had DNA.
Benson.
MUNCH:
Liv, Warner's unwrapping Jane Doe now.
We'll send you a photograph.
She's got head trauma and a wide ligature on her neck.
Do you recognize her?
Renee Simmons.
She was a secretary in Mr. Morgan's accounting department.
BENSON:
And why didn't you report her missing?
Because she wasn't.
She wasn't speaking to you, Counselor.
I laid off Renee and 12 others Friday morning.
We collected their id badges and swiped them out.
They all left the building immediately.
Is there a reason Renee would come back Friday night?
Clean out her office?
We did it for her.
I'll handle this, Ingrid.
You don't have to answer to them.
Ingrid, please.
Renee is dead.
We're going to need to speak with her coworkers.
Maybe one of them knows who did this.
Well, anyone who knew Renee knows who did this.
Her husband, Matt Simmons.
Guy went nuts after she divorced him.
What do you mean "nuts"?
Enough for an order of protection.
But we couldn't legally keep him out of the building.
He works for Friedman and Sons as a stockbroker on the 58th floor.
Simmons didn't swipe out.
Well, if Renee left the building after being laid off, how did her ex get her back in without being seen?
fin:
Let's ask him.
Hey, Matt!
Got a sec?
fin:
Hey!
Where are you going?
He's closed.
Weed.
Felony weight.
At least eight ounces.
No wonder you had the munchies.
Please cut me a break on the weed, man.
The SEC will yank my trading license.
Your license?
Your whole life is about to go up in smoke, pal.
Renee?
Oh, my God.
Was she the one that was killed on the 58th floor?
You should know.
Medical Examiner says you bashed her head in and strangled her.
No, I didn't do that.
Yeah, you did.
You wrapped her up, hauled her down the steps, and dumped her like some trash.
(STUTTERlNG) I didn't kill Renee.
I swear.
fin:
This was your big chance.
You knew they were going to cut the power to your office, and you knew she got laid off.
And you knew she needed money.
Is that how you lured her back, Matt?
Offer to give her some?
fin:
Had her creep in through the loading dock, walk up all those steps to the 58th where you snatched her in the men's bathroom?
Please!
Why would I kill her?
The same reason she got a restraining order against you.
You're obsessed.
I was pissed.
She was banging that sleaze ball boss of hers, Morgan.
Richard Morgan?
How do you know that?
I followed them.
Lunch at the same hotel every Tuesday.
What they were eating wasn't on any menu.
I wanted Renee out of my life.
But not like this.
Richard Morgan, 56.
CEO of RichMo lnvestments.
Fifteen years on the Fortune 500.
Big philanthropist.
Martial arts enthusiast.
He teaches karate to underprivileged kids.
Also a tenant at Trent Towers in 1987 when Nancy Pierce was murdered there.
BENSON:
Same MO as Renee Simmons, same murder weapon.
Ligature marks are identical.
Twenty-two years between murders is a long time.
If Morgan is our guy, why no similar killings?
Maybe he just didn't need to.
Or we haven't found his other victims yet.
We think he was screwing Nancy way back when?
He was having an affair with Renee Simmons.
He could have killed them both to cover up his dalliances.
Or some other secret they learned during pillow talk.
And Daniel Hardy takes the fall.
Anything in Nancy Pierce's case file that can help us?
There are vouchers for blood and semen from her body.
I've got the property clerk looking for them now.
Well, I meant anything that could help us suss out Morgan's motive for killing Nancy.
Well, according to Morgan's testimony at Hardy's trial, it was all Hardy.
Let's see. "Daniel Hardy had the master keys to the building."
"Daniel Hardy had a temper."
Ah.
Listen to this one.
"That night, I saw Hardy yelling at Nancy in the hallway.
"Next thing any of us knew, she had disappeared."
Morgan was master of the universe.
I was a slave, a nobody.
I still am.
STABLER:
Okay.
Nancy.
She was an accountant?
She was a junior partner at a small firm.
Around the time she disappeared...
Did she seem nervous?
No, the opposite.
She was excited.
She tells me she's gonna pay for me to go to college.
She was going to buy an apartment.
That she was going to be rich.
How rich?
Half a million bucks.
From Morgan.
He was going to buy out her firm.
Nancy was gonna take her piece of the action and quit.
He flipped out.
Said she had to stay on to get the money.
The next day, goes back to the office to get her stuff.
And then, Sunday...
They find her dead.
Nancy was murdered Friday, October 23rd, 1987.
That was four days after the stock market crashed on Black Monday.
Now, the market tanks again.
Any cat with Morgan's kind of scratch must have taken a bath.
Well, that's reason to lay people off, not motive to murder two women.
Not if he had something to hide that both women knew about.
MUNCH:
Like his money.
What do you got?
Richard Morgan is broke.
Morgan's books show investments totaling almost 800 million bucks.
But all his accessible bank accounts show that he only has $5 million on deposit.
So he would have been wiped out if one of his big clients cashed out.
Or a bunch of smaller ones.
We called some of them.
Morgan's been stalling on paying them back.
It sounds like he went to the Bernie Madoff school of investing.
Makes sense to me.
That's more than enough motive to murder Nancy Pierce and Renee Simmons.
They both worked in accounting.
They both had access to his books.
They must have stumbled onto his Ponzi scheme.
Renee didn't just stumble onto it.
Buddy at the irs said she was their informant.
He found out, he whacked her, and he tried to blame it on the ex.
Old habits die hard.
And two women paid with their lives.
This guy knows we're onto him.
He's going to skip town.
Not if we clip his wings first.
MORGAN:
Guy shows me the yacht he buys with his bailout bonus.
(BLOCK LAUGHS)
And you know what he says?
"Your tax dollars at work."
(ALL laughing)
I'm done with you guys harassing my client.
We've only just started.
Stand up, Mr. Morgan.
You're under arrest for Fraud and Grand Larceny.
You're ruining his reputation.
Save it for arraignment, Counselor.
It'll all work out.
Excuse me.
"Docket ending 2-4-5.
People v, Richard Morgan,
"Charges are..."
Is this right?
Two hundred and thirty counts each,
Grand Larceny and Fraud in the First Degree, and 20 counts of income Tax Evasion?
Your Honor, you're looking at Bernard Madoff,
The Karate Kid edition.
That's prejudicial, Judge.
I want her censured.
MASKlN:
I don't see any jury here, Ms. Block, and she certainly isn't going to prejudice me.
How do you plead, Mr. Morgan?
Not guilty.
The defendant has a private plane and ample means to flee the country.
We request remand to Rikers.
Remand is excessive.
My client wasn't charged with a violent crime.
Yet.
Mr. Morgan is also being investigated for rape and murder.
And when he's charged with either of those, he'll await trial in Rikers.
The defendant will surrender his passport and be confined to his home with an electronic monitoring device.
Bail is denied.
We're in recess.
Press is staked out at every exit.
News travels fast.
Boy, you're not kidding.
The US Attorney called.
They're indicting tomorrow.
Well, if we're going to get Morgan on those murders, it's now or never.
You're wasting my client's time.
BENSON:
Well, your client better get used to having a lot of time on his hands.
But that's not all he has on his hands, though, is it?
Is something about this funny?
MORGAN:
Well, I was just thinking about your accusation that I bilked my clients out of hundreds of millions of dollars.
You don't seem too sorry, considering you ruined a lot of lives.
Including the poor bastard who's sitting in prison for the murder you committed 22 years ago.
As memory serves, Daniel Hardy was convicted by a jury of his peers.
It's interesting that you remember his name.
I don't know what you mean.
If you had DNA to prove any of this, we wouldn't be having this little chat.
Unless you're going to arrest my client again, he's going home.
I am going to get Daniel Hardy out of prison.
And make sure he takes every cent that you have left.
Good luck on your hamster wheel.
Shall we?
That bastard will do anything to protect his money.
Even the ice princess can't get him out of this.
MAN:
You ruined me!
(GUN firing)
(PEOPLE clamoring)
COP:
Drop the gun!
Drop it!
Now!
Okay.
Calm down, sir.
Get against the wall.
Get against the wall.
No pulse.
What the hell happened?
We were taking Morgan out when the old geezer got off the elevator and shot him.
He stole everything from me.
All I've worked for my whole life is gone.
You okay?
I'm fine.
BLOCK:
I heard him the first time.
He pointed the gun right at me, and then he fired.
Twice.
I saw the blood on me and thought I was hit.
Well, that's really all I need from you.
Is there somebody that I can call to take you home?
No.
But thank you.
I'm sorry about your client.
STABLER:
The guy's name is Thomas Rooney, 80-years-old.
Wife recently died of cancer.
(PHONE ringing)
Morgan would not give him his money back.
fin:
Tutuola.
Said he had nothing left to lose.
How did he know that Morgan was here?
El, property clerk on two.
Yeah, Stabler.
I've got vouchers that say it is there.
Well, just...
Okay.
Yeah, thanks.
DNA from the Nancy Pierce case is gone.
Which means Daniel Hardy is now officially, eternally screwed.
He is staying in prison for the rest of his miserable life.
BENSON:
Miss Block!
Miss Block.
Everything okay?
Yes.
I'm sorry.
I realized I just need to ask you a few more questions.
So, if you don't mind.
I've told you everything about the shooting.
BENSON:
This isn't about the shooting.
This is about the pictures of the two women that your client murdered.
I saw how disturbed you were by the photos, Counselor.
And yet, when your boss of 25 years gets murdered in cold blood right in front of you, you seem relieved.
Why is that?
I don't know.
Yes, you do.
You've known all along.
I don't know what you want me to tell you.
I just want the truth.
Did you help Richard Morgan carry out his Ponzi scheme?
Absolutely not.
Did you know about it?
No.
I had suspicions.
But I was his lawyer.
The attorney-client privilege forbade me from revealing anything Richard ever said to me.
That bastard stole millions of dollars.
He killed two women.
He never told me he planned to kill anyone.
Come on, Liv.
Ask her about Hardy.
I'm gonna rake it out of that bitch.
Hold on, Elliot.
You're not going anywhere.
BLOCK:
What do you want from me?
BENSON:
Something that will help us free Daniel Hardy,
I can't help you with that.
Well, you are his only chance.
Thomas Rooney made sure of that when he murdered your boss.
I have a duty to preserve my client's confidentiality.
He's dead.
The law says it doesn't matter.
Richard Morgan let an innocent man take the fall for a murder that he committed.
I took an oath.
You're protecting a corpse!
My life was protecting him.
Don't you understand?
If I betray him now,
I betray everything I've stood for.
Ingrid.
Morgan's gone.
You don't have to cover for him anymore.
An innocent man is gonna spend the rest of his life in prison.
Unless you step up.
I realized Richard murdered Renee Simmons on Friday afternoon.
After he did it.
Because he told you?
He didn't have to, but I knew.
Because I knew 22 years ago he murdered Nancy Pierce.
How did you know?
Have you ever seen a shadow box?
Sure, a small display case that you hang on the wall.
Richard had one in his office.
It held every karate belt he'd ever earned.
I didn't see that in his office the other day.
Because last Friday afternoon,
Richard brought it to my office and asked if I could hold onto it for a while.
After he murdered Renee Simmons.
So, you're saying, that Richard Morgan did the exact same thing
22 years ago in Trent Towers.
Richard brought me the shadow box that day, too.
Said he was renovating and asked if he could leave it with me.
We were all in shock when Nancy's body was found, and Richard was busy with his renovation.
It got me thinking.
I knew he'd just bought out Nancy's accounting firm and that she wanted to leave,
It didn't take a genius to put two and two together.
So several days later, I asked him if he had anything to do with Nancy's murder.
And he said...
"As a matter of fact, yes."
I pleaded with him.
I told him,
"Richard, Dan Hardy, the maintenance guy,
"is going to jail for killing her."
Do you know what he did?
(SCOFFS)
He giggled and said, "l know.
Isn't it great?"
So, all these years...
You've known that Daniel Hardy is an innocent man,
There isn't a day that goes by that I haven't thought about that poor man.
Yeah, boo-hoo-hoo.
She let him rot in prison for two decades.
What the hell is wrong with her?
CABOT:
If she had come forward, she would have been disbarred.
Maybe gone to prison.
For providing evidence that would set a wrongfully accused man free?
Only Massachusetts allows an attorney to break privilege if he or she knows of actual innocence.
And since privilege doesn't die with the client, she just committed career suicide.
BENSON:
So what did you do with the box after you realized why Morgan gave it to you the first time?
I went home.
I couldn't sleep.
The next day when I came into the office, it was gone.
When I went to see Richard, it was already back on his wall.
BENSON:
And now?
Is it still in your office?
BLOCK:
Yes,
In the back of the credenza, behind my desk,
He wasn't lying.
I found Nancy's epithelial cells all over the belt.
And Morgan's.
Arrogant bastard didn't even clean it up.
He just hung it back on his wall like he was untouchable.
Lucky for us.
Lucky for us Ingrid Block cleared her conscience.
She did us a huge solid.
Yeah, 22 years too late.
There's more.
I found Renee Simmons' DNA and blood on the belt, too.
That's why the ligature marks look the same as Nancy's.
The son of a bitch used the same belt to murder both women.
And now, we have bulletproof evidence that Morgan killed Nancy, and Daniel Hardy did not.
HARDY:
You want to tell me what's going on?
STABLER:
You're getting out, Daniel.
That simple.
It's over.
Richard Morgan.
He killed Nancy.
Richard Morgan.
Are you sure about that?
Both their DNA was on the karate belt that he used to strangle her.
The belt from his office?
How did you find out?
Because I gave it to them.
You?
You're Morgan's attorney.
Until he was killed two nights ago.
Did you know Richard killed Nancy?
Did you know that Richard killed Nancy?
You knew.
You knew, and you didn't say anything.
The law says I couldn't.
(SHOUTS) The law?
You had that power to get me out 20 years ago, and you didn't say anything?
You let me sit here?
How do you live with yourself?
Twenty years!
Let's go.
DONNELLY:
The English judge, William Blackstone, said,
"Better that 10 guilty persons escape than one innocent suffer."
I am sad to say that in this case, our system fell far short of that standard.
This court can never repay you the years you were wrongfully imprisoned.
I can only apologize for this gross miscarriage of justice which made you a victim.
That said, Daniel Hardy,
I am hereby setting aside your conviction of Murder in the Second Degree.
I order your record expunged and your immediate release from custody of the State Department of Corrections.
We are adjourned.
(GAVEL POUNDS)
Thank you for everything.
I just wish there was more we could do.
There is.
Ingrid Block?
Detective Stabler.
You're under arrest for facilitating a murder.
Elliot, what are you doing?
I'm getting justice for Renee Simmons.
She put the murder weapon right back in Richard Morgan's hands.
So do you understand your rights as I've explained them to you?
I've already told you everything I know, and I'll act as my own attorney.
Well, if I were you, I'd hire someone more ethical.
Detective Stabler, please, understand...
You can save that for a jury.
Do you have any idea what you've just done?
The job I was hired to do.
You didn't clear this arrest with me or Alex.
You didn't even tell your partner.
(sighs) I followed the law.
We're not finished, Detective.
Though you're awfully close.
Captain, it was a good collar.
I read the facilitation statute.
Proof that a little knowledge is a dangerous thing.
Morgan gave his lawyer the black belt he used to strangle his first victim.
She returned it to him.
Which she had a legal right to do to preserve attorney-client privilege.
Ingrid Block knew Morgan had killed once.
She knew he was capable of doing it again.
When she handed that belt back to him, she facilitated Renee Simmons' murder.
I am tired of defense attorneys hiding behind privilege to withhold evidence.
STABLER:
Ms. Block told us that in 1987,
Mr. Morgan confessed to her that he had strangled Nancy Pierce with the black belt from this box.
And how do you know Mr. Morgan later killed Ms. Simmons with the same black belt?
His DNA was on the belt with both victims'.
Thank you, Detective.
Nothing further.
Detective Stabler, who is this man?
Objection.
BLOCK:
Goes to the witness' credibility.
Overruled.
Answer the question, Detective.
That is Victor Tate.
I arrested him in 1998 for rape.
Did you later learn he did not commit that crime?
Yes.
Where is Victor Tate now, Detective?
He's serving out his sentence in Sing Sing.
How is that possible if he's innocent?
The only man that can prove he is innocent, the real rapist, committed suicide.
While in police custody.
So an innocent man remains in prison even though you did your job.
Yes.
Detective Stabler, do you believe I'm responsible for leaving Daniel Hardy in prison?
Yes, I do.
But that's not the only reason you arrested me.
You did it to assuage your own guilt about Victor Tate, correct?
CABOT:
Objection.
Withdrawn.
Nothing further.
As a lawyer, I took an oath never to reveal a client's secrets.
This trust is so sacred it is protected by law.
Which means that if you, you, or you are ever arrested, you can be sure I will maintain your confidentiality.
Attorney-client privilege is a fundamental basis to your right to a fair trial.
Richard Morgan gave this shadow box to me in 1987 and admitted using the black belt to strangle Nancy Pierce.
Because he knew I couldn't tell the police.
I agonized about it.
I knew I couldn't keep this, because I'd be guilty of obstructing justice by concealing evidence.
My only legal option was to give it back.
But before I could, the shadow box disappeared from my office.
To this day, I have no idea how Richard got it back.
Your witness.
So the belts were stolen and magically reappeared on Richard Morgan's office wall.
Did you ask him how it happened?
Yes, he wouldn't tell me.
But of course, you have no way to prove this, do you?
Because your only corroborating witness is Richard Morgan, and he's dead.
Correct?
I'm telling the truth.
Really?
Because you just told this court you had a sacred duty to protect client confidentiality, which you violated, did you not?
To get an innocent man out of prison.
If you were so concerned about Daniel Hardy, why didn't you come forward 22 years ago?
Every day, I wanted to come forward.
A wrongfully convicted man sat in prison because of my actions.
Until you decided to break your oath.
And you did break it, didn't you?
Richard was dead.
There was no way my revelations could hurt him.
So, which is it?
Keep the oath?
Break the oath?
Keep the belts?
Give the belts back?
I told you.
They disappeared from my office.
And into Richard Morgan's hands.
He used this black belt to murder Renee Simmons.
You're right.
I should have stopped him.
It's my fault.
Renee Simmons' murder is my fault.
No more questions.
You really took her apart in there.
I'll take that as a compliment.
Alex.
(SlGHlNG)
This is wrong.
Am I missing something?
The only reason we're in that courtroom is because you arrested Ingrid Block.
I think I made a mistake.
I want you to drop the charges.
Too late.
McCoy certainly won't let me, and after what I just did in there, the jury has no choice but to convict.
Unless I give them one.
If I didn't owe you one, I'd never let you bring me back.
Why are we here?
The guy with his back to us.
What about him?
He's you.
What are you talking about?
His name is Victor Tate.
I collared him 11 years ago for rape.
Last year, I found out he didn't do it.
I screwed up.
He's going to be serving out his sentence.
Nothing you can do for him?
No.
But you can for Ingrid Block.
You want me to help her?
Do you remember Richard's karate belts?
What about them?
I don't think Ingrid gave them back to Richard after Nancy's murder.
Someone with access to her office did.
Block stole 22 years of my life.
Revenge isn't going to get them back.
Helping that bitch going to get him out?
What do you care?
Her hands were tied by the law.
Listen, man, she should be punished for what she did to me.
Richard Morgan put you in here.
He's the one who stole those years from you.
Now if Ingrid Block hadn't come forward, that would be you.
You'd be pushing a mop for the rest of your life.
Wednesday, October 28th, 1987 was my first day back to work after my girlfriend, Nancy Pierce's, funeral.
As soon as I came in, I got a call from Mr. Morgan.
What did he want?
He asked me to take the shadow box out of your office and put it back up on his wall.
Why would he send you?
I was a building maintenance man.
I had a master key.
Did you carry out his request?
Yes, I did.
Why didn't you tell me what you'd done?
Mr. Morgan said if I did, he'd fire me.
You didn't think that was unusual?
When Mr. Morgan asked, I delivered.
What did he do when you brought the box back to him?
He smiled.
And then said,
"When you've got a black belt, you can do anything."
The next thing I know, I'm being arrested for Nancy's murder.
Thank you.
Nothing further.
No questions for this witness.
The defense rests.
Mr. Hardy, you may step down.
Rebuttal, Miss Cabot?
None, Your Honor.
Then the defense moves for a directed verdict of not guilty on the grounds the People have not proven beyond a reasonable doubt
I facilitated the murder of Renee Simmons.
As reluctant as I am to take this decision away from the jury, it's clear that the defendant had absolutely no intent to commit a crime.
And for the record, it is abhorrent to me that a District Attorney would so blatantly use our system of justice as a means to a political end.
The defendant will rise.
Ingrid Block, I find you not guilty in facilitating a murder.
This court is adjourned.
(CLEARS THROAT)
I owe you an apology, Counselor.
And I owe all of you thanks.
Miss Cabot, I represent Thomas Rooney on his murder charge.
He's 80-years-old.
He's sick.
Any way you can plead him out?
I'll see what I can do.
Ingrid's a glutton for punishment, defending the guy who murdered her boss.
I get it.
It's her way of helping one of Morgan's victims.
If it were me, I'd move on.
Well, maybe she's grateful to Rooney for taking the monkey off her back.
Or she has a guilty conscience.
STABLER:
You called Rooney two hours before he murdered Morgan.
BENSON:
You told him that Morgan was here, didn't you?
Did you tell Rooney to kill him, too?
No, I just told him where Richard would be.
But you knew he was ready to explode.
You just lit the fuse.
All I did was make a phone call.
Knowing that we'd never be able to touch you.
Thomas Rooney did what I should have done 22 years ago.
I always hoped the law would catch up with Richard.
The law doesn't always guarantee justice.
But this time, I did.
(SCREAMING)
I can see the head, I can see the head!
One more push.
It's coming.
- It's coming, darling, it's coming!
- (SCREAMS)
It's a little baby boy.
(WOMAN GASPS)
And...and another one.
And two girls, and a boy.
Yes, thank you, Professor Robert Winston, we get the idea!
Aw, bless her, it's like she's trying to say something, innit?
Patronise me, Gary, why not?
Destiny, look at Mummy.
Oh, and now you're filming me.
Wonderful(!
)
In fact, why not just invite the neighbours?
(DOORBELL RINGS)
Oh, Jesus!
Not Jeff and Linda!
Argh!
Any second now...
Any second now...
I don't know what you're being such a girl about, man.
Marion, the love of my life, is giving birth.
And you know puppies are my favourite.
It goes puppies, then dolphins, then elephants.
Then unicorns...
No, wait, ponies, then unicorns...
It's a shame the dad didn't stick around.
I knew he was too good to be true.
Like his great-grandma's buried in the Blue Peter garden(!
)
Well, look on the bright side, Nels - now he's out the way, you could be the dad.
(GASPS) God, you're right!
I'd make a great father!
I taught you how to ride a bike, how to catch...
Er, well...
- # Raindrops keep fallin' on my head... #
- I'm doing it!
I'm doing it!
- Catch!
- Argh!
And if I help Destiny raise her bastard children, she'll finally see how much I love her.
Can you keep the noise down?
Some of us are trying to self-harm.
Oh, come on, Debbie, we're just excited about the new pups.
Great, cos that's just what I need to hear(!
)
Here's me completely barren, ovaries as much use as Gail Porter's hairdryer.
Lord, take me now!
- Ahem.
- Destiny, are you OK?
Five pups, eight bitches, mother tired but radiant.
Now, who wants to see a gorgeous puppy?
Ooh!
Me, me, me!
Me, me, me!
(ALL GASP)
Don't be scared by the nasty animal.
He can't get you.
Are you sure?
- What if he eats through the glass?
- What?
!
- Rrrghhh!
- Oh!
(VOMITS)
I just burped, and a bit of sick came out.
Can't see from here.
Describe her for us, Nelson.
Yeah, go on, Nelson.
Don't be all gushy, I'll be embarrassed.
Wow.
Er, don't know where to, um, start.
She's got lovely...
lovely...eyes?
You say "eyes", Nels, but she's only really got one, and it's all bulgy and this funny red colour.
- Red?
!
- It's pink!
Pink for a girl.
Exactly.
OK, maybe she is a little unconventional in the old face department...
Oh, that's the face !
I get it.
But she's got character, like Sophie Dahl or Sarah Jessica Parker.
- Or a shaven mole...
- Thanks, Marion, that's plenty.
Destiny, she's a real heartbreaker.
- Course she is.
Takes after her mum.
- Rrrrgh!
Holy crap!
That is one ugly puppy!
- Excuse me?
- It's like the sun, innit?
You can only look at it for a couple of seconds before it sends you blind!
- Ignore her, Destiny.
- I can still see it!
Damn you, 360-degree vision.
Like I care what you lowlifes think, anyway!
Destiny, wait!
Kali, you...oaf!
I was only being honest.
Yes, and I was only being diplomatic.
The puppy clearly had a face like a smacked arse.
- DESTINY:
I can actually still hear you.
- Right, sorry!
(WHISPERS) Her puppy clearly had a face like a smacked arse.
Oh, man, even talking about it makes me feel sick.
DESTINY:
Why not just chat somewhere else?
Righto!
Ghoulish as they are, they're still Destiny's pups.
If I can win their hearts, I'll win her.
Maybe I'll get them a nice present.
Thoughts?
Oh, well, they'd look good in one of those things you put on their heads.
Begins with a B.
Bonnet?
Beret?
- Bobble hat?
- A bin bag!
Oh, right.
Or something nice from IKEA!
What's IKEA?
They might have some old stock at Wembley Park from the spring-summer range.
A lot of it's ex-display material, but the quality's still excellent.
- What's IKEA?
- So I'll get the gift,
- you make the card, understood?
- What's IKEA?
Excellent.
Toodle-pip!
No, seriously, what's IKEA?
Whoa!
OK, so you're not the prettiest puppies in the world.
We can still be happy together.
You're bound to have my brain.
(SIZZLING)
- (SIZZLING)
- Who wants geeky kids, anyway?
What's important is you respect your mum.
Ah!
Oi!
All that really matters is we love each other!
- (SNARLING)
- Ow!
- (GLASS SMASHES)
- Oh, crap.
Ah, little scamps, they just need a strong male role model...
Die, vermin!
Argh!
Not the snout, please!
Just take my purse!
Nelson, you twat!
It's me, Vinny!
The Vinster, Sir Vincealot...
The Vince-a-sizer, Vince-o-rama, the V-Man...
Vince-Wincey-Spider, Vin-Tin-Tin, you know, Vince!
Oh, Vince!
God, haven't seen you since Mum's funeral.
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today on the A40, just past the Little Chef, opposite Travelodge, to mourn the passing of dearly beloved Bernadette...
- (TYRES SCREECHING)
- Oh, God, Terence, no!
...of dearly beloved Terence and Bernadette.
So how's the family?
Where's the wife?
- Under a train!
- And the kids?
I ate 'em!
Well, that explains the lack of thank-you cards last Christmas.
And now I'm free and single, I fancy a large boys' night out in the city.
- Ooh!
Two words
- Mamma Mia.
- You what?
Oh, I know the story's nonsense, but the music is quite spellbinding.
Nelson, old son, I'm a fox, yeah?
I just want to have sex, maybe eat someone.
Yeah, I'm pretty sure most theatres have rules about that kind of thing.
Sod it!
Let's go for a drink.
Ah, well, I was on my way to IKEA...
I ain't drinking alone.
- Ahem.
Destiny?
- Mm?
Sorry for saying that your litter was so ugly you should be prosecuted for fly-tipping.
- You didn't say that.
- Yeah, it came to me after.
Well, I don't care, anyway.
I'm too busy bonding with my wonderful pups.
I can't bear to be apart from them for a single second.
I see house prices have taken another tumble.
Destiny, it's OK not wanting to be with your pups.
Is it?
Oh, thank God!
I was starting to think there was something wrong with me...
No, it just means you're dead on the inside with no capacity for genuine emotion.
Oh.
But I'm just not ready to be a mum, you know.
I'm not even three years old, for God's sake.
Oh, I don't know.
Debbie, is you thinking what I's thinking?
Er...
And we're happy the British courts have recognised my client's legal right to end her life with dignity.
Are you ready?
I'm ready.
(SQUAWKING)
(CAMERAS CLICK)
I'm probably not thinking what you're thinking, no.
Destiny, if you want to get over this whole bonding thing,
- just try holding them...
- Oh, OK.
...under about 50 centimetres of water.
- Kali, I am not drowning my puppies.
- OK, I'll drown them.
- No!
- How about I just drown one of them?
- No!
- Not even the one
- with the freakishly large head?
- N...
No!
If you really can't cope, put them up for adoption.
Lots of kids get adopted...
(WHISPERS) ...and never even know.
Mum, Dad, you wanted to tell me something?
Oh, yeah!
I'll find them a better mum, someone who can give them the love they deserve.
Fine, so long as I can give them a special cuddle before...
- You are not smothering my puppies!
- (TUTS) Whatever.
Now, wipe your feet and I'll make you a nice cup of herbal tea.
Jesus!
What is this place?
Oh, excuse the mess, someone died here last night.
Wait, if you were at evensong when the crime was committed, you can't possibly have heard the fatal gunshot.
J'accuse!
A murder-mystery dinner?
Nelson, you're supposed to be a fox, in't ya?
I am a fox!
Now, camomile, blackberry or elderflower?
I don't want your gay elderflower tea.
Well, if you prefer something stronger, I have got peppermint.
You're an embarrassment, mate.
What would your old mum say?
And she'd be right!
OK, maybe I have made some compromises living in the city, but I'm the same fearsome creature, red in tooth and claw, et cetera.
- Red what?
- It's Blake.
Or is it Tennyson?
Point is, I'm still king of the urban predators!
Yo, Nels, I found some of that sparkly, silver, glitter glue
- you're always on about.
- Not now, Marion.
All right?
Marion, Nelson's best mate.
- You're best mates with a pussycat?
- Well, technically,
- he's more a mate of a mate.
- What are you on about?
You bought that poofy Forever Friend bear for my birthday.
That is absolutely preposterous!
It was a key ring.
OK, Nelson, if you're the big fox, you get this pussy out your den.
All right, then...
(CLEARS THROAT) ...
I will.
Please may you leave the glitter glue on my beanbag, then get the heck out of my den?
Oh, well, if that's the way you feel, see you about, then, yeah?
Bye.
Oh, I think I've upset him.
You've ruined everything!
Me?
!
I ain't the one living like some kind of tame little nonce!
OK, look, you might not approve, but I'm happy.
I've got mates, I've got my own spice rack and I'm this close to winning the heart of the dog of my dreams!
You're in love with a dog?
Yes, and she's called Destiny and she's amazing.
So why don't you get out, Vince?
Go on, go!
I never want to see your face again!
Now, would you like a nice coconut macaroon to take with you?
(DISH SMASHES)
Oh, great(!
) Now I'll have to sweep.
What's up?
- Someone crap in your food dish?
- No.
Check again, Tiddles!
It's Nelson, he's got this new best mate, and he's harder than me.
Oh, well, why don't you just try talking to this new mate?
- Maybe you could all be friends together.
- Do you think?
No, course not!
Beat the crap out of him, homo!
But I can't fight!
My owners will get me neutered.
I've got an idea, but only if you promise to eat me
- the second I find a way out this coop.
- Debbie, I swear to God
I will tear your face off and eat you from the inside out.
You're not just saying that?
- I promise.
- Witness!
OK, here's what you'll need to get rid of this new mate - a tripwire, four knitting needles, two kilos of dried, pitted prunes...
Come on, boy, we're getting your nuts chopped off.
What?
!
Look, I thought we had an understanding, man!
Wow, that seemed entirely arbitrary.
Yep.
Aw, looking at you now, all peaceful, it seems almost a shame to give you away.
- (AIR HORN BLARES)
- Hey, pups!
Papa Nelson's here!
Nelson, you arse!
I'd only just got them off to sleep.
- But I've bought them a present.
- Oh.
I didn't have time for IKEA, so I made them a nice puppet.
Because who could be a better role model for their impressionable minds than...
Jesus Christ himself!
Oh, it's me!
The Big J!
I've only gone and risen again...again.
Nelson, that's Russell Brand.
What?
Uh, forget the puppet, it's gone.
Now, I heard you weren't really coping and that you're putting the pups up for adoption?
- Who told you that?
- Oh, heard it on the grapevine.
Plus, I got one of the fliers.
And I saw the ad in the paper.
And Phil and Fern did a brief segment on it.
Yeah, well...
I want to make sure they get the best possible parent.
Then look no further.
- Ha!
You?
- Why not?
I love you, and we could be a team - you, me, the pups?
- Just the 1 5 of us?
- Nelson?
- Yes, my love?
- I'll tell you why not.
Because you're a fox, and I'm a pedigree Afghan hound.
And FYI, you grotty little bin-sniffer, you will not raise my pups,
I will not fall for you in spite of myself and I will absolutely, definitely, 1 00%, categorically never see past your mangy exterior to the real you inside!
(WINDOW SLAMS SHUT)
(MUFFLED) OK, sorry, so just to clarify... (GROANS)
No!
Do not do this, please!
- Lively little fella, isn't he?
- Lively?
!
You're cutting my balls off!
So who's the surgeon in charge, then?
Yeah, not so much a surgeon per se, as Chico, the losing finalist from 2005's X Factor.
What?
Run that by me again.
It's some reality show thing.
You know what TV's like these days - any excuse to crowbar in a famous face.
- (KNOCK ON DOOR)
- Chico's on his way.
- Cheers.
- OK, deep breaths, Marion!
It's probably just a really weird dream!
Whoo!
# It's castration time... #
- OK, time-out, time-out!
- Now, boy.
This'll help you hit the high notes.
No, no, no, stop this madness!
- Someone, please!
- (GAS HISSES)
Vince.
Vince?
- Dr Vincenstein.
- What do you want?
Only this, to say the hardest thing one friend can say to another.
- Gav?
- Yeah?
You know that Arctic Monkeys album you leant us?
Yeah?
Well, I'm kind of having sex with your mum.
Sorry.
I'm sorry for throwing you out of my den.
Oh, God!
You haven't bought me some kind of girlie present, have you?
- (BOTH LAUGH)
- No!
As if!
Abort, abort.
- The fact is, you were right!
- Really?
And me and Destiny never would have worked.
For one, I live next door, and it's like they say - never crap where you eat.
Why not?
I always crap where I eat.
Hand wipe?
Anyone?
OK, so you want to be a real fox again, then, yeah?
Prove it.
I'm talking about a boys' night out, big style!
Well, I suppose I haven't let my hair down in a while, not since the Eurovision party.
Well, I've got something a little bit messier in mind.
(LAUGHS) Oh, that was pretty messy!
You see, we all brought a dip from a different country, and Marion was Greece, so he was in charge of the hummus, and...
Shut up!
And follow me.
- Abso-bloody-lutely!
- (SQUELCHING)
Crikey, I see you weren't joking about the whole crapping-where-you-eat thing.
Ah.
Ah.
Ooh!
Ah.
What's up?
- You wouldn't understand.
- Try me.
I've just been surgically castrated by Chico from The X Factor.
You're right, I totally don't get that.
I feel so humiliated.
I mean, for God's sake!
He didn't even win it!
Still, this'll cheer you up.
Whoa, man!
How did you get out?
Now, I won't lie, it wasn't easy finding a way to get that lock open.
The key!
The key to the coop
- I am free!
# Hallelujah!
Halle... #
(GASPS) Oh, for the love of God!
So I picked the lock with a feather.
Come on, big boy!
Take me now!
Rip me wing from wing!
- What's wrong?
- Don't know.
- It's like I'm not in the mood.
- Is it me?
Am I not appetising enough?
- I've got some Oxo cubes somewhere.
- No, it ain't that.
(GASPS) It's my balls!
Chico!
What have you done to me?
Great.
Do you have any idea how stupid I feel right now?
Oh, come on!
I only had my balls chopped off, like, an hour ago!
- Oh, that old line.
- Well, I'm sorry!
At least you're out now.
Maybe you could just, you know,
- finish yourself off.
- Oh, marvellous(!
)
(PUPS WHIMPER)
OK, according to my list, you're the... only applicant to adopt my pups.
But I've got a really good feeling you're the perfect mum.
Now, what are your parenting skills?
Hello?
Oh, sorry!
I was up till five sniffing strangers' bottoms
- so I could get drugs.
- Good!
Yeah, so you're resourceful.
I'll just make a quick note of that.
Then I got drunk on Magners and ate a family of squirrels from Dagenham.
- Strong on discipline.
- And I mean the whole family.
Women, children, even tracked down the uncle.
Very dedicated.
Well, that's all I need to know.
Happy parenting!
Let's have a look at them, then.
- (PUPS BARK)
- Jesus!
Argh!
Eurgh!
(VOMITS)
(SIGHS) Bugger.
What a night!
I went out on the lash and I didn't even take my hay fever medication!
- Whoa, lock up your chickens.
- Then we went to a club!
Oh, you should have seen me, Debbie.
I just played it cool.
#Are we human
# 0r are we dancer?
#
Then I got really tired, so Vince give me some kind of magic bean...
And then we just had a bloody good chinwag.
This is so amazing!
I just want to stay up all night and drink and dance and then fall asleep with my contact lenses in!
We should do something really wild together, you know?
Like watch all six series of Sex And The City back to back!
Or book a jigsawing holiday to Dublin, not even take out the optional travel insurance!
Or eat something!
Something small that can't fight back, like...

Destiny's pups!
Pups?
She's got pups?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, and we should eat them.
Wait!
- # Wake up in the morning... #
- Sorry,
I have really got to go and dance!
Ah.
Turns out I may have accidentally taken some drugs and made a brunch date with a big, scary fox to eat Destiny's pups.
Nelson, you absolute idiot.
I know, but I only did a half and I drank loads of water!
- No, the pups.
- Right.
Oh, God.
Think, man.
Wait!
It'll be OK, Destiny'll protect them.
I can't cope!
I've got to get out!
- I've got to get out!
- (PUPS YELPING)
(SIGHS)
There we go, no-one's going to spot the bald patch now.
- What happened to your balls?
- Damn it!
Look, if it makes you feel better, you look dead good on it.
- Oh, cheers.
- In fact, you look two stones lighter!
(SNIGGERS) Too soon?
It's too soon.
I miss them, Kali, both of them.
(MUSIC STARTS)
Oh, God, he's going to sing.
(AUTO-TUNE EFFECT) # Hey, yeah, yeah
# Reach down to touch You can't believe there's nothing there
# Wanna run my fingers through your short and curly hair
# It's just the little things Those moments I can't face
# Bending down to lick you Just to find a bald, pink space
# Those times we spent together Man, they was intense
# Remember when I tried to jump over that barbed wire fence?
# What about my sex life?
What will I tell my bitches?
# That Chico's cut my knackers off and left me 1 5 stitches?
# I'm in pain Gone insane since they cut you babies up
# Or maybe it's just the anaesthetic wearing off
# He wants his balls back
# That's what I'm saying
# He wants his balls back
# Back here and swaying
# He wants his balls back
# I really need them
# Back in his sac
# Anybody seen them?
# Used to be just us three Now I've lost my desire
# Cos you're gone, I'm alone But I can sing two octaves higher!
# He wants his balls back
# Do you get me?
# He wants his balls back
# Why'd you vet me?
# He wants his balls back
# Just want to scratch you
# Back in his sac
# Wish they'd re-attach you Ooh, whoa, yeah. #
(THEY SPLUTTER)
Well, the good news is, I know my way to the vet's.
- Yeah, how?
- I'm a homing pigeon, you muppet!
I've got a built-in sense of direction, innit?
SAT-NAV:
Take the next exit.
What exit?
There is no exit!
Turn around where possible.
Oh, well, (BLEEP) you, lady!
So come on, then!
Let's reclaim those gonads!
Yeah, all right, then.
They will just screw back on, though, won't they?
(WHISPERS) OK, the coast is clear.
- I think we're going to...
- Oi, oi!
So where are these puppies, then?
Ah, about that - you're absolutely sure you wouldn't prefer muffins?
They're gluten free.
Nelson, what's under the blanket?
Oh, my gosh!
Pop impresario Louis Walsh!
- What's Louis Walsh?
- Well, it's all just gossip, but I'm thinking bi-curious at the absolute least.
Now just look that way.
- (HE GASPS) - (WHIMPERING)
Ah, damn it, that's a shame.
You just missed the little Irish scamp.
(IRISH ACCENT) So you did, hoo-hoo!
( # THEME FROM MISSION:
IMPOSSIBLE)
Whoa, man, it's like that Indiana Jones film in 'ere.
What, Raiders 0f The Lost Ark?
No, the new one...
a massive pile of bollocks.
Now, where are my nuts?
Hmm, no, they're too small.
(SCOFFS) Not really my colour!
Now, they're a bit different!
(GASPS) My babies!
Oh, my God, I missed you!
Things'll be different this time, and it won't just always be about the sex.
I will pamper you, I'll protect you...
- Kali...
Kali, what are you doing?
- (MUFFLED SPEECH)
I can't understand.
You'll have to take my balls out of your mouth.
You really think I brought you here out of charity?
Ha!
If you want your knackers back, you'll have to work for them.
You evil little bitch!
Marion, that ain't evil, it's vindictive!
- OK, Barry!
- No, no, no!
(THUD)
Now, that's evil.
(CHUCKLES)
You mean there's no puppies?
!
Oh, it must have been some kind of practical joke.
That Destiny, she is a prankster.
PRESENTER:
Meet Nelson - he's a racist, alcoholic cross-dresser and he beats his wife.
Hang about, this isn't Cash In The Attic.
Well, sorry I've wasted your time.
Anyway, I'll let you get on.
But you've got my e-mail address, remember, not the Yahoo one -
I use that for spam, OK?
Bye!
- Loser!
- Argh!
I just saw that big, scary fox climb in!
Please don't tell me he's eaten my puppies!
(SOBS) How will I ever know happiness again?
!
- Destiny, they're fine.
- Oh.
They're right here in the...
rotating hot cupboard.
- Quick head count - two, four, six...
- (WHIMPERING)
Oh.
One missing.
(DISTANT VOICE) Puppy!
Puppy heading for the park!
Nelson, game on!
- Oh, no!
What have I done?
- You moron!
Still, she's gone now.
Time to move on, rebuild our lives.
No, we can still save her!
- Yeah, we probably can't.
- There's not a moment to lose!
OK!
Fine!
Behold!
See how the mighty tom cat is brought down.
I wouldn't normally do this, yeah?
But she's got my knackers.
And if you ever want to be Nelson's hard mate again, you'll do exactly what I say, right?
Now, oink like a pig!
Oink, oink, oink.
- Bark like a dog!
- Ruff, ruff!
Boost my self-esteem like Gok Wan.
Girlfriend, you is working those feathers.
Excellent, my whiskery minion.
Now awkwardly read an autocue like Lily Allen.
Coming up, music from...
Kings of...
Leon.
Well, now, there's something you don't see every day.
Where are you, you tasty little bastard?
A-ha!
Oh, no!
Looks like we're a split second too late.
No, it doesn't!
Vince, you put down that puppy!
You what?
This is breakfast.
Good point.
And breakfast is the most important meal of the day, so...
- I can't let this happen!
- Oh, yeah?
And what you going to do about it?
Well, I suppose I might just have to, like, apply to the county courts for some kind of restraining order.

Yes, you are!
(SQUEAKING)
(GASPS)
Oh, hi.
How are you feeling?
You should see the other guy!
I did.
I watched him beat the living crap out of you.
- Oh, yeah.
- But thank you.
Thanks for taking care of my babies while I sorted my head out.
- Oh, it's OK.
- And I was going to ask if you'd help me raise the pups...
Oh, my God, Destiny, this is the happiest moment of my then my owners flogged 'em to a blind couple from Northampton.
- Ah.
- They'll be gone within the hour!
And I'm single again, so I'm off to the park.
Ciao!
Marion!
- What?
- She doesn't need me, Marion.
- She never will.
- Still, at least I've got my nuts back.
- Yes, I did notice those.
- I'm a man again!
And I want to say...
I love you, Nels!
- I really, really love you, cuz!
- Oh, er...
Yeah.
Thanks, Marion.
I, um...
love you too.
Where did you get the wheels, by the way?
Oh, you know...
I found 'em.

Subs from DVD, with SubRip_150b4 Subtitle Edit 3.0 Numenor
You're taking birth control pills?
I'm not, no.
I found them in Julia's study.
This is an absolute proof that Julia is having an affair ***.
When I think of them together, my hand turns into fist.
You also remember the woman I mentioned to you, Malini?
Did things end badly?
She threw herself from the bridge and drowned.
I think Julia and Arun, the intimacy with which they relay reminds you of your own intimacy with Malini.
That may be one of the reasons why you feel so conflicted in your relationship to your daughter in law.
It may be, but... maybe.
1000 dead, another estimated 200,000 displaced from their homes in what the governor of west bengal is calling one of the most devastating monsoons to hit the east coast...
Aid has been slow to arrive, as most of the local roads are flooded.
Indian prime minister...
You know, I have to admit
I was a little bit worried the last time at the end of our session.
Things are no better, Paul.
In fact they are worse.
Why?
Has something...
has something happened?
Monsoons have flooded the region where my parents were raised...
Entire village underwater.
Well, I...
I had no idea.
I'm so sorry to hear that.
How would you have any idea?
Because floods have scarcely made the news here.
Everything is about the New York Knicks.
Who is this player...
Amare Stoudemire?
I'm searching to hear of the disaster in India and all they want to talk about is this basketball player, as if he's a superhero and he's going to save the world now.
Now I'm all the time searching for news on the b.B.C. Channel or on this radio with this terrible reception.
And...
These pictures...
they stay in my mind.
And... and I'm having difficulty to sleep.
So when you do manage to sleep, are you having any more of these disturbing dreams?
I keep seeing the same image...
You know, a boy, perhaps three or four.
He's clinging to an automobile tire, and his head barely above water and his eyes, you know...
they are pleading.
This is in the dream?
No no, this is real.
It was on the news...
B.B.C. News.
I wanted to pass through the television and rescue that poor child.
People are traveling from other areas to help.
And I'm trapped in Brooklyn, useless, locked away like a prisoner.
So is that what you feel like... like a prisoner in your son's home?
My son is gone.
He's been gone for three days, attending a medical conference in St. Louis.
Before he left we watched the early reports together.
He pointed to the television and said,
"oh baba, I'm glad that you are not there."
Hmm.
I feel like
I'm outside of my life.
I feel like a...
like a stranger.
A prisoner, a stranger.
I cannot stop myself from watching.
I cannot change how I feel.
I just wonder if there aren't other things that you might be able to change.
Other things, meaning what?
Look, Sunil, things can't go on as they are.
What about the possibility of your moving from your son's home?
I know you can't go back to Calcutta... you told me that... but finding someplace else to live.
And where...
Where, please tell me, would that be?
Your own apartment?
Okay.
And... and who would pay...
pay for this?
You could get a job.
Like selling printer cartridges at best buy or standing behind a kebab wagon?
I cannot do that, Paul.
I will not.
I'm not suggesting that you...
But you're just wasting your time, Paul.
See, I'm as helpless to change my surroundings as those people in my country who are unable to save their houses from floodwaters.
I know you are a hopeful man, my friend.
You like to think that you can...
You can fix everything.
I think that you have to talk with your son.
No, just... just hear me out on this.
You're not happy where you are.
And it's pretty obvious that having you in their home hasn't been easy for them either.
Yet you've never spoken to your son about this.
You've never expressed to him directly what you feel or what it is exactly that you want.
I didn't understand that.
I said that you are wasting my time too.
I know, I know it can be difficult to talk to family, your children, in a completely honest way because you risk a painful conversation.
This is just a strategy, yes... to tell me you know how I feel?
No no, it's not a strategy.
Look, Sunil, I have kids myself.
I know what this is like... to sometimes want to put off difficult discussions.
But you don't know my son, Paul.
You have no idea.
I'm telling you with certainty there's nothing to be gained... absolutely nothing.
You're so convinced that he's not gonna help you.
How can you know that for sure?
Because I've already spoken to him the night before he left.
I was thinking of you, Paul...
How you encourage me to express myself.
So I told him the truth.
I told him that seeing the images made me certain and I need to return.
Here I'm useless.
I'm only in the way here, to let me go.
And what did he say to that?
He told me that he would never let me go back to Calcutta, he had made a promise, and he could never betray his mother.
He also told me that...
"why do you want to make a fool of yourself?
What will you do back in India, in all that water, jobless?"
Then he said, "Julia will send a check to the red cross in your name,"
and that they would buy me a queen-sized mattress from Macy's departmental store.
Later that night I overheard them talking in the kitchen.
Julia was saying, "oh, if he wants to go, let him go."
And she said she was not comfortable staying with me alone in the house.
And what did Arun say to that?
He told Julia that she was being dramatic and ridiculous and that he felt better having a man there to protect her and the children while he was away.
Then Julia called me unstable, this word "unstable"... like an old fruit wagon with loose wheels.
To be called this word...
I held a position of mathematics professor for 28 years.
I was married to Kamala for 30 years.
Is this a profile of someone who is unstable?
If anything, she is unstable...
Julia.
She has been behaving like a madperson... madperson since Arun went away.
How do you mean, she's behaving like a madperson?
What is she doing?
She's continuing her adventures with Mr. Ethan Barr...
the pale fox.
On Saturday night they went out, leaving Naya with an upset stomach.
And you were watching the children?
No no, I'm not allowed.
She would not allow that.
Liza the nanny...
She stayed late.
Uh-huh.
He actually came up to the door to pick her up.
So you met him?
Yeah, he is not quite as handsome as he appears on the jacket cover.
And did you speak to him?
Did he...?
We shook hands.
He's young, more modest than I thought.
I congratulated him on his success.
Then he said something which surprised me.
He said that...
"I have heard quite a lot about you."
When they walked down the stairs they looked back at me and they laughed.
You thought they were laughing at you?
Please, Paul, you must trust me.
If you had seen for yourself, you could not doubt me this time... not this time.
My son said he wanted me there to protect her, but I felt quite the opposite.
I wished to smother her laughing.
To...
Let me get this straight...
To smother the sound of her laughter or to smother her?
They were laughing at me, Paul.
Yeah, I understand...
No, you don't understand.
They were humiliating me.
See, now look at your face.
I have alarmed you now.
Yes actually, because the words that you're using are...
I'm trying to share with you how their laughter disturbed me.
I'm trying to express myself, as you say.
- You understand this, yes?
- I think so, yes.
Good.
Because it only grew worse.
At 1:00
I heard talking in front of the building.
My window faces the street.
I saw Julia and Ethan barr.
He escorted her up the steps and then... and then kissed her goodnight.
What do you make of this?
Well, it depends what kind of a kiss it was.
A kiss is a kiss.
Don't you think I know what a kiss looks like?
Well, was it on the lips?
No no, it was on the cheek.
Well, that's not really an uncommon thing for people in America to do when they're saying goodbye.
I know, I know.
You will think what you want to think.
Anyway, after he kissed her,
Julia carefully lifted her hand to a spot below his eye and then gently drew the back of her curled fingers down his cheek.
Julia never touches my son's face in this manner.
How much proof do you need, Paul?
Last week I brought you solid evidence...
Her birth control pills...
and you still want more.
Is this not enough?
Not necessarily.
It's not acceptable, Paul.
She is disgracing my family.
After I witnessed the kiss,
I could not move from the window.
I could hear her down on the second floor, preparing her bed.
And I thought I heard her lock her bedroom door.
She did not even come upstairs to check on Naya.
And then I wanted to go to sleep, but I could not stop myself thinking of Julia lying on her bed, who she was thinking of.
I think it all would be better if she ran off with Mr. pale fox or she simply disappears.
Disappears?
What do you...
What do you mean by that... disappears?
I have to say that some of the words that you've used today, Sunil...
I really want to understand what it is that you are trying to say to me.
If your feelings are as extreme as I'm hearing them today...
You asked me whether I had more disturbing dreams.
I have had one again.
- The same one?
- No, a different one.
It was quite troubling.
Do you want to tell me about it?
Yeah.
Perhaps it will help you to make sense of my feelings.
I hope so.
I saw my son Arun lying on the street in front of the house.
And he was unconscious.
The children were inside, looking out the window.
They were afraid.
Beyond the street there was a forest of thick black trees.
And a woman with long dark hair came walking out of the forest.
She wore a long white gown, bright as the moon.
And I was standing over my son.
And as the woman started walking towards the house,
I was trying to hold my son's arm.
And I pulled it and it broke cleanly off like a piece of old plaster.
So I was thinking that I should use this arm to protect the children.
To protect the children from this woman?
Now the arm was quite heavy, dense.
I could hurt this woman very much.
And...
I woke up as I was about to strike her.
So you were going to strike this woman to protect your grandchildren?
I'm quite confused by this woman.
Who do you think she could be?
Well, sometimes it's not so much the physical similarity as the feeling.
Do you think it could be Julia?
No, she had dark hair.
It was dark, black as onyx.
And Julia's hair is yellow.
Perhaps it was Julia in disguise.
Is that how you see Julia...
in disguise?
Do you see her as a threat?
She has a secret life.
The woman was most definitely not Kamala.
What makes you so sure of that?
Because I would never think of harming my wife.
Do you feel that you could harm Julia?
The thing I found strange was that I could not make out the details of the woman's face even when she drew very close.
You know, I started to grip my son's arm with great force.
I could feel the blood pulsing into my hands.
And she was so close that I could almost smell the flower she wore in her hair, but I could not see her face.
The flower in her hair like in the El Greco painting?
Sorry?
That's the painting you mentioned when you first spoke of Malini.
What do you mean?
Well, you've just spoken about her death after 32 years of silence.
It's not surprising that some form of her... even the slightest gesture or detail... might show up in your dream.
Like a rabbit in a hat?
Bong!
Oh, there she is.
You said that you felt you had this need to protect your grandchildren.
You said you felt the blood rushing into your hands and that you were prepared to harm this woman.
See, Paul, I no longer wish to discuss this dream.
Okay.
Can I ask you why?
Because I cannot see the point of this exercise.
But I'm confused.
A moment ago you asked me to help you understand these nightmares that you're having, to help you make sense of the feelings that you're having.
So that's what I'd like to do.
For instance, this woman coming from the forest...
It's clear that she has a big effect on you.
Do you... you disagree with that?
See, the image of you removing your son's arm...
Well, sometimes there's something primal or animalistic that dreams allow us to express that our conscious mind is...
A man can only be pushed so far.
I have decided it was not Malini in my dream.
And it upsets me very much for you to suggest this.
I...
I...
I would never ever think of harming Malini.
Why would you think I would assume you'd hurt Malini?
Okay, we don't have to talk about that now.
I don't understand what you're saying.
You have no idea what my life has been.
But I want to understand.
I want to know.
Can I ask you what you did when you woke up from the dream?
I checked on the children.
They were fine, sleeping.
I then went down to Julia's room.
I could not resist.
I wanted to check to see if her door was in fact locked.
And?
It was.
What would you have done if her door wasn't locked?
Her door would not open, and this is all that matters.
No, but I'm asking you, what would you have done if the door had been open?
I thought of calling you.
Why didn't you?
It was the middle of the night.
And things felt out of balance.
Then I went upstairs to my room and I wrote to Kamala.
Can I ask you what you wrote?
I really did consider calling you.
The next time I want you to do that.
Okay?
Yeah, perhaps.
Sunil, there's so much going on in your life at the moment:
You've lost your wife.
You've started to talk about a love affair that ended in tragedy.
You're worried about your son.
You're worried about your grandchildren.
You have these conflicted ideas about your daughter-in-law.
You're anxious about the floods in your homeland...
in India.
I'm concerned about you, Sunil... that with all of these intense feelings coming to the surface
I understand how difficult it could be for you to stay in control.
And I...
I want to suggest that you consider coming here a little more often, maybe twice a week.
You think I'm going crazy?
No no no no, you're not...
you're not crazy,
I assure you.
I have patients who come to see me two-three times a week, but it doesn't mean they're crazy.
It's just that they can benefit from working more on themselves, going deeper with therapy.
Julia and Arun... they have done enough for me.
And I would prefer not to ask anything more than this.
Well, would you like me to talk to them for you?
No no, please.
I would not prefer that.
Do you pray, Paul?
Do I... do I pray?
Yes.
Sometimes, yes.
Then please pray.
For what?
For the rains to stop in India.
(Male announcer) Previously on Hell's Kitchen...
It may have only been morning...
(All) Morning, chef.
(Announcer) But chef Ramsay began the day with a shocking move...
Melissa, give me your jacket, because you're in the blue team.
(Announcer) To wake up Melissa.
Now I want to see you shine.
(Announcer) But he didn't stop there...
Red team, you're lacking a leader.
(Announcer) Asking Trev to step up.
Trev, your jacket and the red team.
(Announcer) Then, in the creative-salad challenge... (Gordon) I want to see how imaginative you are.
(Announcer) Chef Ramsay invited the senior food editor of bon appetit to judge.
This lady knows her stuff.
It's a lovely salad.
Thank you.
(Announcer) The bad...
This dish minds me of a hot dog.
(Announcer) And the ugly.
It's visually a train wreck.
(Announcer) But there was one dish that stood out above the rest...
The scallop was perfectly cooked.
(Announcer)Elonged to.
Congratulations.
(Announcer) Who clinched it for the blue team.
Good job, buddy.
(Announcer) During dinner service...
Trevor, welcome to the red team.
(Announcer) In the red kitchen...
Come on, girls!
(Announcer) Gail pushed out the appetizers...
Gail, delicious, delicious, delicious.
Thank you, chef.
(Announcer) But Sabrina on garnish...
Where's the rest?
Come on!
Can't do it all!
I can't do it all!
(Announcer) And Nona on fish...
They're not coloring, man.
(Announcer) Failed to deliver.
Scallops are raw!
(Announcer) In the blue kitchen...
How long on scallops?
(Announcer) Russell took charge.
Focus.
I am focused.
No, you're not!
(Announcer) But Boris was a disaster on garnish.
I like [Bleep] Mashed potatoes!
You're a [Bleep] Embarrassment!
Get out!
(Announcer) And Melissa followed up a performance where she overcooked a mountain of meat by ruining a sea of scallops.
I [Bleep] The team, chef.
I've had enough!
(Announcer) Both teams...
That was horrific.
(Announcer) Had to nominate one person...
The red team has nominated Sabrina.
The blue team nominated Boris.
(Announcer) But chef Ramsay wasn't satisfied with the nominees.
(Gordon) Nona, Melissa, step forward.
(Announcer) And in the end it was...
Melissa.
(Announcer) The 31-year-ol sous chef from Albany whose dream of winning Hell's Kitchen went up in flames.

Goodnight
All:
Goodnight Chef.
Trevor can you come here please.
You know I've dodged the bullet five times.
Like all I'm asking of everyone is like a clean slate.
I'm beginning to run out of luck.
We don't have anything against you, Sabrina we don't.
Just check the attitude.
I don't think I have an attitude, man.
You do.
You do.
You do.
The truth hurts, you know?
I have a bad attitude.
You guys are right.
You guys are right.
I'm serious.
I just have to come in tomorrow with a new attitude, because I'm not ready to leave yet.
I'm not gonna have an attitude anymore.
I promise.
I don't believe a damn thing Sabrina says!
"Oh, I'm gonna show you that I'm humble.
"I'm gonna show you that I won't have an attitude.
I'm hungry." No, you're a ghetto bitch.
It's time for Sabrina to go home, bad.
Chef hates me.
He [Bleep] Hates me.
There's no way any of us can help you with that.
(Boris) I'm disappointed in myself.
I expected to come here, kick ass, be a [Bleep] Cowboy.
You know?
I need to make a comeback.
That's my third time tonight.
You skated by by the skin of your teeth tonight, big boy.
Just got to do this, guys.
Got a couple people that got [Bleep] To prove and, you know, just got to keep moving forward.
Boris is on his last string, so we've been carrying him for about the last week.
You know, I'm not gonna do it anymore.
It's just unbelievable.
(Announcer) It's been a rough night for Sabrina and Boris, but as a new day begins, they know it's a new opportunity to fight back and show chef Ramsay what they're made of.
Let's go!
Holy [Bleep].
Oh, [Bleep].
Wow, wow, wow, wow.
I see this covered table with this black sheet over it, and I'm like, "I wonder if that is a corpse."
Right, good morning.
(All) Morning, chef.
Okay, as you know, great chefs are imaginative, yeah?
Have to think fast on their feet.
They understand the combination, the executions, and the marriage of ingredients instantly.
And they're willing to gamble, yes?
(All) Yes, chef.
Which brings us to our next challenge.
Yes.
[Laughter]
Especially made for Hell's Kitchen.
Wow.
It's roulette.
It's roulette.
[laughs] So excited.
I love roulette.
Oh, I love roulette.
So much fun.
Listen to me.
There are 18 different letters on the wheel.
Each of you will spin the wheel.
Every time you land on the letter, you have ten seconds to come up with an ingredient beginning with that letter.
And then each team comes up with one stunning dish using your chosen five ingredients.
Obviously, gentlemen, there's four of you in the blue team.
Vinny, you'll spin twice.
Yes, chef.
Everyone ready to begin?
(All) Yes, chef.
Let's go.
Blue team first.
Let's go.
(Announcer) In this challenge, each chef will choose one ingredient based on a spin of the wheel.
Right.
Are you ready?
I'm ready.
(Announcer) Vinny is leading off and it's important that he selects an ingredient that his team can build on.
And you go "k."
Ten seconds.
Okay.
Uh...
Five.
Four.
Kale.
Kale.
Vinny's [Bleep] Fast on his feet.
Boom, boom, boom-- kale, yes, excellent.
Back around.
Come on, vin.
"Y."
Ten seconds from now.
Uh...
Ah!
Yams.
(Gordon) Yams?
Boris.
Let's go, Boris.
"M."
Ten seconds from now.
Miso.
Miso?
[laughter]
When Boris said, "miso," I just looked at the rest of the team, and they were just like,
"oh, my God."
Miso?
Miso.
Yeah, we really didn't need miso.
It's hard to work with.
It's hard to get it right.
Okay, miso.
Miso.
Brr.
Okay.
Rob.
(Announcer) After three spins, the men have two unusual vegetables...
We're working with kale, yam... (Announcer) And one asian seasoning.
And miso.
Yes, we are.
(Announcer) And with only two spins left, they desperately need a main ingredient.
We don't have anything.
We'vaccomplished zero here.
Spin the ball, big boy.
Let's go.
It's all on my bacing good.
Here we go.
And "
ten seconds from now.
Um...
Striped bass.
Striped bass?
Boom--striped bass, right on the money.
Good.
Nice one.
Good choice.
Off you go.
And you're "a."
Asparagus.
Asparagus?
Okay, good.
And...
That's what you're working with.
Back in line.
(Announcer) The blue team has completed the selection phase of the challenge.
Okay.
(Announcer) And now it's time for the red team to have their spin at the wheel.
Off you go.
Whoa.
"R."
Ten seconds from now.
Come on, Trev.
Come on, Trevor.
"R." So easy.
And immediately I think radicchio, raspberry, roast beef, radishes, red peppers, ravioli, rib eye, ricotta, refried beans, risotto, e, rhubarb, ribs, rice.
Ingredient, please.
Rutabaga.
Rutabaga?
Rutabaga?
Really, Trevor?
Adventurous.
(Announcer) After wrestling with his "r"s,
Trev's radical roulette result is the random root...
Rutabaga.
Where the [Bleep] That one came from, I don't know.
Off you go, Jillian.
(Announcer) Next up is Jillian...
Make it count.
(Announcer) And she chooses...
"C." Ten seconds from now.
Cauliflower.
(Gordon) Cauliflower.
(Announcer) While Sabrina picks...
Um, bok choy.
Bok choy.
Wow.
Rutabaga, cauliflower, bok choy.
[bleep] Me.
We might be.
Gail, good luck on that one.
Ten seconds with "f."
[Sighs]
We really need a core for this dish right now.
Fennel, chef.
Fennel?
"Fennel" comes flying out of her mouth and I'm scared right now.
Abt what you have...
And...
What the hell are we gonna do with these ingredients?
Like, we can make some crazy weird soup or something.
This is getting scary.
Start thinking about that main ingredient.
Off you go.
Come on, Nona.
You got to get us a protein, girl.
"S." Ten seconds from now.
Salmon.
Salmon.
Boom.
My girl Nona nails it.
Now we got a protein.
We can make this work.
Well done.
Thank God for that.
Okay, everybody ready to begin cooking?
(All) Yes, chef.
Yes?
30 minutes starting from now.
Off you go.
(Announcer) The teams have only 30 minutes to figure out the best way to combine their ingredients and make a spectacular entree.
I think we should do a cauliflower puree.
Rutabaga chips.
I came up with the goofy thing rutabaga, so it was up to me to come up with options.
Ps.
I just got to get the seasoning right on those.
Yeah.
Good.
That's good.
I don't know how to work with miso.
I know how to work with miso.
I picked miso.
I will stand by miso.
I take the responsibility of doing the miso myself.
I think we're there, okay?
I think we're there.
At this point in time, it's do or die.
Aprons-- aprons coming your way.
Okay, guys, I got the miso.
Get it working, though, if you're gonna get a broth going.
Get it working.
Miso is kind of one of those things that's on the fence.
We're gonna have to have Boris work with it and have him kill it, because if he doesn't, we're gonna go down.
Are you confident in that?
Yes.
I would not have chosen it if I didn't know what to do with it.
Or that you didn't know what else to do with an "m."
Guys have no [Bleep] Confidence in me.
That really [Bleep] Hurts.
If they don't have faith in me, that's one thing, but I have faith in myself.
I don't give a [Bleep] What you think.
I will make this [Bleep] Work.
Taste it.
How does that taste?
Tastes pretty good.
Okay.
Well, thank you.
I nailed it.
This is what I do.
Trust me when I tell you this is a man who knows his miso.
It works.
This miso broth, it's growing on me real fast.
I'm thinking it's gonna be pretty hot this dish now.
(Announcer) Boris' miso has won the blue team over.
Yeah, it tastes nice.
(Announcer) Meanwhile, in the red kitchen, the verdict is still out...
So how are those chips?
(Announcer) On Trev's rutabaga.
Taste 'em.
I've never really cooked rutabaga chips before.
I really wasn't sure what was gonna work and what wasn't.
Tastes burnt.
The chips were burnt and bitter, and I'm like,
"mm, mm-mm.
Chef's not gonna accept that."
I think this is gonna be fine.
(Announcer) Trev has managed to impress one person with his rutabaga...
Tastes good.
(Announcer) Himself.
No, no, no, no, no.
(Announcer) But he's not the only one who's impressed with his own cooking.
Working with yam and asparagus is simple-- simple, simple, simple.
What else do you have in there?
All I'm goa do is just blanch these off--that's it.
I just don't know if we're going in the right direction with the yams and the asparagus.
Wow, dude, seriously?
It seemed simple and plain put some cilantro in there too.
But I can't do everything by myself.
You know what you could do?
Is you could get some coriander to tie in the [Bleep] Cilantro.
I don't think we should.
Fine, don't do it.
Five minutes to go!
You guys want to taste the puree?
More butter, more salt.
The cauliflower puree was giving me a hard time.
We can get it creamier, though, can't we?
It's not looking good.
Can't get it any more creamier.
It's all right.
Just use lots of butter.
Come on, guys.
Let's go.
I'm gonna do everything I can and make it work, 'cause if not, then we're [Bleep].
Oh, my God.
Mmm!
Okay, it's [Bleep] Creamy.
Good.
Last minute to go!
(All) Yes, chef.
Here we go.
Let's go!
Start plating!
Let's bring it together, guys.
Fennel sauce is done.
Fennel is done.
Okay, hold on.
Where we going?
Right here on top of the bok.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yo, grab the Fleur de sel real quick.
(Gordon) Ten, nine...
Come on, cgo, go, go, go.
(Gordon) Eight, seven...
There's no Fleur de sel.
Yes, there is.
(Gordon) Six, five...
Do not go back there!
(Gordon) Four, three...
Put the plate up.
(Gordon) Two, one, and stop.
Let's go, guys.
Each team had to turn their five individually selected ingredients into one stunning dish.
Okay, let's start off with the red team first, shall we?
Sabrina, bring the dish forward, please.
Thank you.
Wow.
(Announcer) The red am has made a grilled-salmon dish in a cauliflower puree with baby bok choy, pan-roasted fennel, and rutabaga chips.
Salmon is cooked perfectly.
Pink.
Thank you, chef.
Yes, chef.
The fennel's delicious.
It's nice.
Unfortunately, the cauliflower puree split.
It's almost like you've had too much butter in there.
I dropped in whole butter.
What a shame.
It tastes nice, but it looks like [Bleep].
Okay.
Come on, Nona.
To [Bleep] Something up like that is, like, such a rookie mistake.
The chips, who did that?
I did, chef.
Bitter!
I'm disappointed with those.
For those [Bleep] Stupid rutabaga chips.
Right, blue team, let's go.
(Annncer) It's now time for the blue team to present their pan-seared striped bass with braised kale, asparagus, and fried yams in a light miso broth.
Presentation-- all that wow factor.
That looks nice.
Like, ours didn't look that nice.
Fish cooked perfectly.
Miso tasted delicious.
Boris, that was you, yes?
Yes, chef.
Sweet, delicious.
I knew it!
I knew it!
That right then and there just makes everything worth it.
My problem with that dish is the asparagus and the yams.
It's like it's sort of-- it's lazy 'cause there's nothing exciting.
Who cooked the asparagus and the yams?
I did, chef.
This is the chance for you guys to do something different, something just with flavor.
So...
Hard, very hard, 'cause there's areas of flair, but then there's areas of blandness-- the asparagus and the yam.
I could match that th thecauliflower.
I don't expect that at this level, that's all.
[Bleep]
Okay, tough decision-- real tough decision, because the fish was cooked perfectly.
The winning team on a very tough challenge-- cauliflower that looked a mess, but it tasted delicious.
The red team, congratulations.
[Cheers and applause]
[Screaming]
(Gordon) Well done.
Holy [Bleep].
I can't believe we just pulled this off.
Thank you, chef.
Red team, well done.
Thank you, chef.
Thank you, chef.
Listen carefully.
I'm sending you to a resort that both Jennifer Lopez and Elton John
this special place is in Vegas.
[Cheers and applause]
You'll be staying at the Rio all suites and hotel.
Your suite is 14,000 square feet.
[Screaming]
Head up to the dorms and start packing.
Let's go.
[Screaming] Rock on.
We're going to Vegas!
Vegas!
Hey, red team.
Blue team...
On our next dinner service, we are hosting an exclusive family night.
Each table will be welcomed with an assortment of fries.
So, blue team, for your punishment, you'll be spending the day washing, peeling, cutting, preparing well over 1,000 potatoes.
Your delivery of potatoes is actually here, so head outside.
Let's go.
I'm just pissed about this.
I didn't come to Hell's Kitchen to cook [Bleep] Potatoes.
Open the door.
[Laughter]
Holy [Bleep].
There's potatoes everywhere, man.
It's a mess, and guess what-- we got to pick it up.
That is one big truck.
Bye, guys.
Bye, guys.
Bye.
Have fun.
Have fun peeling potatoes, boys!
We'll be in Vegas!
Whoo!
Hi.
Welcome to southwest.
I'm so excited.
I've never been to Vegas.
I got my hooker boots on, and I'm gonna have a good time.
Yeah, this is awesome, man.
(Announcer) While it seems like the sky's the limit for the red team...
There's a lot of [Bleep] Potatoes.
(Announcer) It seems like there's no limit to the blue team's punishment.
Tell me about it.
This is my fifth bust-up.
By the time we're done with this, don't we have to cut them all, you know, for fries and [Bleep]?
We'll probably be here until dinner service tomorrow, just because Rob didn't grill the asparagus.
Thanks, buddy.
I'm tired of this.
(All) Go, red team!
(Trev) Vegas--I've never been here before.
This is the v.I.P. Treatment I've been waiting for.
Welcome to your suite.
[Gasps] [bleep].
(Nona) We open the doors to palazzo suites, and it's just marble tile everywhere...
[Gasps]
Monstrous ice sculptures with Sushi and lobster and caviar.
[Plays piano]
[Laughter]
Welcome to the big time!
I have never in my entire life seen anything like the suite that we're in right now.
Oh, there's a jacuzzi here too!
It is absolutely beautiful-- the most amazing thing I've ever seen.
Lap of luxury.
I'm actually really enjoying this potato business here.
I'm Russian.
I love the potato.
You could fry.
You could bake it.
You could make potato soup.
You could live on that [Bleep].
I couldn't think of a better reward than to peel [Bleep] 30,000 potatoes.
It's great.
Boris does a lot of this and he does very little this.
I love it.
If Boris doesn't step up, he's gonna go home.
I'd rather be doing this than going to Vegas.
(Announcer) While the blue team knows exactly what they'll be doing for the next several hours...
[Cell phone rings]
The red team...
Hello?
(Announcer) Is in for a big surprise.
Who is it?
They're not saying anything.
Hello?
[Breathing heavily]
All I hear is breathing.
Hello?
Let me handle this.
Hello?
Hello!
It's penn and teller.
Open the [Bleep] Door!
Door!
Open the door!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Hi.
[screaming]
Hi.
We're penn and teller.
(Announcer) The red team is thoroughly enjoying their reward high atop the Vegas strip in their 14,000-square-foot suite.
[Knock on door] Door!
(Announcer) And it's about to become...
Hi.
[screaming]
(Announcer) Even more magical.
We're penn and teller.
Show us around this place.
Is it nice in here?
I'll be damned if it's not penn and teller in front of me.
Congratulations.
You guys had all won here?
I got penn and teller in my room.
I'm just in awe.
These two guys are great magicians.
You want an envelope?
Yes!
And we got gifts.
It was just the top of all tops.
"You're a winner at one of Las Vegas' resorts."
Two nights--here.
No way.
What?
Yeah!
Gonna do okay.
[Laughter]
Where you going, girl?
Yeah!
Hell, yeah!
I'm about to come back up in here and party.
This is the "awesomest" reward ever.
It is so cool.
Can we get a picture with you?
(All) Yes!
I love it.
One, two, three, smile.
[Laughter]
(Announcer) While the red team parties the night away in Vegas, back in Hell's Kitchen, it's all business.
We have to kill it tomorrow, bro.
We have to carry Boris tomorrow.
Boris--he's just out of his league.
If he goes down, it's gonna drag the rest of us down with him.
I don't want to lose, and if we lose,
I know what the reason why is gonna be.
I ain't going up.
You ain't going up.
So it's gonna be them two.
And they know it.
Not only do , Ramsay knows it.
He knows we're the two studs in this [Bleep] Group.
I won't let him down.
Talk to you in the morning.
(Announcer) It may be a brand-new day in Hell's Kitchen, but the blue team shares the same old opinion of Boris.
(Russell) Boris, what are you doing?
The puree.
Uh-uh.
You're wasting your time.
Work on something else.
[Bleep].
I know where I stand with my team.
I know that they consider me a weak link.
Tonight is the night that I need to make a comeback.
Boris definitely has a lot to prove.
He needs a miracle.
(Announcer) While the blue team preps for tonight's dinner service, the red team returns from Vegas...
Hey, guys.
What
(announcer) Hoping to continue their winning streak.
We just got back from Vegas, and the red team-- we're excited.
Come on!
We're gonna go, and we're gonna [Bleep] Kill it tonight just like we've been doing.
(Jillian) Sabrina, are you gonna pull this [Bleep] Out or what?
Well, dude, I don't want to pull it out right now.
We can wait till service.
No, we need to pull it out.
It needs to come out.
Okay.
Sabrina said she was gonna change her attitude, but her attitude sucks.
I swear to God if she doesn't set this [Bleep] Station, I'm gonna kick her ass.
It's like a joke, man.
I'm so over Sabrina.
If we lose tonight, tely going back up for elimination, no doubt about it.
Okay, let's go, guys.
(Announcer) Every night in Hell's Kitchen has its challenges.
Tonight is family night.
(Announcer) But tonight, there's little room for error.
In amongst those diners tonight will be my family.
This is intimidating.
If we [Bleep] It up, man, chef's never going to forgive us.
I don't plan on being embarrassed.
Now, five pairs of hands against four.
Trev?
Yes, chef?
Your team has the extra person, so drive the red team forward, yes?
Yes, chef.
Chef Ramsay wants me to take over that leadership position, so I'm gonna take us to where we need to go.
Okay, outside there's a Hell's Kitchen carnival.
Hey are gonna enter the dining room happy.
They're gonna sit down happy, and they're gonna eat happy.
What am I gonna be after service?
(All) Happy, chef!
Right.
Let's go.
All right, James, open Hell's Kitchen, please.
All right, chef.
[Bell rings]
[Indistinct chatter]
Thank you.
Yeah!
(Announcer) It's family night at Hell's Kitchen.
Can I have one of these necklaces?
(Announcer) And in addition to the regular fine-dining menu, chef Ramsay is featuring a children's menu.
As a special treat, each table will receive a welcoming platter of french fries.
Let's go, Trev.
I want those fries out, guys, yes?
It's right here.
Ready, chef.
It's a kids' menu.
We're cooking for four-, five-, six-, seven-, eight-, nine-, ten-year-olds.
Guys, fries going!
They just want something that's gonna taste good.
It shouldn't be that big of a problem.
Coming with the fries!
Fries go straight out, guys, yes?
(All) Yes, chef.
Let's go, Rob.
And go.
It was my fault that we lost the challenge...
Evidently.
There's a lot of pressure on me right now and I'm gonna fight for my life tonight.
I'm not going down.
Behind.
(Gordon) Good.
Look at that.
Beautiful.
(Announcer) Both kitchens had no problem pushing out the fries.
Whoa.
Very nice.
They're really good.
Gentlemen, standby.
Here we go.
First ticket.
Two risotto.
(All) Yes, chef.
(Announcer) Now it's up to Vinny to deliver on the appetizer station.
Work it, Vinny, yes?
No problem.
Not one person is of a cook as m and I'm cool with running apps.
To me, that's a piece of cake.
Hot behind you.
Oh, dear.
How many risotto is that?
Two.
Come here, you.
You're doubling up on the portions.
I've got enough for four.
You're cooking too much!
Yes, chef.
And it's a pure waste!
All of this just wasted!
Yes, chef.
People that eat fine dining are not used to getting portions made for, like, andre the giant.
If I was the owner of the L.A. market and you were my best chef, you're toast!
(Announcer) While Vinny works to deliver a little less risotto, over in the red kitchen...
I got problems with this.
(Announcer) Chef Ramsay is expecting a little more.
Touch more puree in there.
It's a pea risotto.
Come on, let's go.
The freaking risotto, man-- that [Bleep] Just hates me.
I just want to kick the risotto's ass.
Jillian, let's go.
Yes, chef!
See, that's better.
I don't want to see any white rice.
Yes, chef.
Keep it going, Jillian, yes?
Yes, chef.
Good.
(Announcer) 45 minutes into dinner service...
Thank you.
Thank you.
(Announcer) And more than half of the families have been served their appetizers.
That one's mine.
It's good.
Excellent.
(Announcer) And one v.I.P. Table is hoping their father will make sure that they get Fed next.
It's your family.
Here we go.
On order, six covers, table one.
Yes, chef?
Three wings, one mozzarella, one risotto, one truffle salad.
(All) Yes, chef.
My family.
We better get this [Bleep] Order right.
Let's go, guys, yes?
Three wings, one moz is coming, chef.
Vinny, are you ready on the risotto?
No, no.
Vinny, I need the [Bleep] Risotto.
What are you doing?
I can't sit there and, you know, go like this and have my risottos magically finish.
Hurry up, Vinny!
We've got to go up now!
Yes, chef.
I grabbed the risotto I had just sent up for the previous table.
There's nothing wrong with it.
Yo, I'm going up for risotto, guys.
That's not fair.
That's old.
Trying to get away.
Hey, bozo, come here, you.
Yes, chef?
What happened?
Yeah, shut your fat East-coast mouth.
Yes, chef.
This table that you just sent me that [Bleep] For happens to be my family.
Oh, no.
What are you doing?
And even if it's not my family, they deserve a fresh risotto.
Look at me.
Yes, chef.
You dirty little [Bleep].
And if you can't be bothered to do it, [bleep] Off up out of here.
Do you want to go home?
(announcer) It's family night at Hell's Kitchen, and Vinny has taken a shortcut...
That's old.
with the wrong table.
Dirty little [Bleep].
And this table that you just sent me that [Bleep] For whether it's my family or not, if your family were here or your family were here or your family, I'd make your family or your wife, your children
a fresh [Bleeprisotto!
Yeah, that's the [Bleep] I served five minutes ago.
(Russell) Okay, re-fire.
Come on, guys.
Everybody's really happy apart from your family.
(Gordon) Apart from my family?
Yeah.
Come on, Vinny!
Yes, chef.
Sorry about that.
Won't happen again.
I'll fix it.
That's all he wants to hear.
And that's it.
Hot behind, chef.
(Announcer) Vinny has quickly made a fresh risotto.
Service, please.
Table one.
Pickup.
Tell them it wasn't done on purpose.
Let's go.
(Announcer) And chef Ramsay's wife, tana...
Lovely, thank you.
(Announcer) And their four kids,
Megan, matilda, Holly, and Jack, are enjoying their appetizers.
Yummy.
(Announcer) Meanwhile, in the red kitchen...
Standby.
Our first entree.
Two beef.
Yes, chef.
(Announcer) Sabrina is being assisted...
Hey, Trev, you want to give my beef a feel--
(announcer) By a less-than-thrilled Trev on the meat station.
Let me know how much longer I need to put it in there for.
Sabrina is just a Thorn in my side.
I have no idea what's going on in [Bleep] That blonde little head of hers.
Yeah, a little bit longer.
See what they say.
Let it rest?
How long, Trev?
She wasn't confident enough in her own station, in her own cooking ability to just send the food.
Get it in the window.
Got it, Trev!
Hot, hot, hot, hot.
Behind, behind, behind, behind.
Good.
Look at that.
Perfectly cooked.
Yes, chef.
Oh, thank God!
I knew that I can cook meat, and I can cook it well.
(Announcer) Trev's hard work on the meat station has paid off...
Yes, chef!
(Announcer) For Sabrina.
Great.
(Announcer) Meanwhile, back in the blue kitchen, chef Ramsay asks that eternal question.
Where's the beef, Boris?
And you're sweating like a pig.
Slicing the meat right now.
Wipe down your board, you dirty [Bleep].
You've cooked that perfectly, and you're about to slice on that.
Disgusting!
Y, chef.
Oh, [Bleep].
There you go, Boris.
Yes, chef.
There you go.
Boris is a pig.
He's a Russian [Bleep] Pig.
There you go.
I'm sorry, chef.
It will not happen again.
I was just trying to get the food out in a timely manner.
[Sighs deeply]
Beef!
Here's the beef, chef.
Service, please.
(Announcer) While Boris takes a moment to clean up his act, in the red kitchen...
Sabrina, where's the beef?
Right here, chef.
I'm cutting the beef.
That's it, chef.
(Announcer) Sabra has her act together.
Don't cut that meat.
I'm a minute out.
(Announcer) Unfortunately,
Nona, on the garnish station, doesn't.
Oh, come on.
Nona, I need you.
I need you like there's no tomorrow.
Okay.
Speed up!
Garnish is hard.
I am [Bleep] Dying.
Here you go.
Here's the beef.
Polenta fries.
Garnish!
Garnish!
Garnish!
Hang on.
If I have to drag these bitches kicking and screaming through service and get us done and work as a team,
I'm gonna [Bleep] Do it.
Nona, I need it now!
Just give me a time!
15 seconds.
Yeah.
It's like you've gone to the toilet.
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six...
You're [Bleep] Crowding me, dude.
Back up.
Three, two, one.
Give 'em to me.
Here we go.
Polenta fries.
Yeah, yeah.
Go.
There it is.
(Announcer) Unable to solely count on Nona,
Trev helps push out the garnish.
Meanwhile, in the blue kitchen...
It's my family's order-- one salmon, one beef, one macaroni and cheese, one bolognese, two burgers.
Let's go, guys.
Let's make it happen.
(Announcer) The men are scrambling to get entrees out to chef Ramsay's family.
Chef, I'm coming up with the salmon.
Two beef coming up to the pass.
Two burgers.
One bolognese up.
Where's the macaroni, please?
All right, I'm a little behind right now on garnish.
Oh, come on.
I am in the weeds so high, I don't know which way is up.
[Sighs]
When are we gonna get a little help on this garnish, man?
As soon as I can breathe.
Russell claims he was in the weeds and couldn't get to me.
What did Russ do-- a few chicken fingers and two burgers?
[Bleep] That.
How dare he not slide to help me?
I'm pissed.
I'm behind, and we're gonna be [Bleep]
Omeone doesn't jump with me here.
I don't know where he got off thinking that we were gonna be his bitch tonight, but that was definitely not my role.
I'm here to do my job.
I'm not here to babysit you.
Ah!
[bleep]
(Announcer) While Rob flies solo on garnish, over in the red kitchen...
Where's the chicken?
Six minutes.
(Announcer) Sabrina on meat...
What's this for?
(Announcer) Has Trev... (Sabrina) It's for the next order.
I had to keep on and on and on her about times.
The chicken takes six minutes, and a grilled cheese takes two minutes, tops.
Why would you start it just to let it sit there?
Grilled cheese only takes two minutes.
I know.
I'm just getting it hot, Trevor.
Slowly--you got to-- it's a la minute.
I know what I'm doing, Trevor.
Can you stop giving me an attitude, dude?
I know what I'm doing.
Thank you.
"I know what I'm doing, and you don't need to da-da-da-da-da-da-da," and I'm like, "whoa."
I'm not giving the attitude.
I'm trying to speed this up and get it up...
That's fine, Trevor.
But if it's [Bleep] Cold, it's gonna be horrible.
Sabrina, knock it off!
Shut up!
I'm running the show tonight.
Shut your [Bleep] Mouth.
Give me when I ask it and do what you're [Bleep] Told.
Quit it right now.
He's a maniac, honestly, and, like, not in a good way.
Two chicken, where are they?
Come on!
Push this out!
Check that chicken!
Check this chicken, Trev!
Yeah, go with it.
Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot.
Here's that chicken, chef.
Look.
That's raw.
Sabrina!
Trevor, if you don't know what you're talking about,
(gordon) Hurry up!
I can't drag these tables with children in the dining room.
Let's go!
(Announcerina must ruh to re-fire her chicken, because out in the dining room...
These customers are not very good at waiting.
I'm hungry.
(Announcer) Meanwhile, in the blue kitchen...
Come on, Rob.
(Announcer) All the men need to complete the Ramsay family table is Rob's macaroni and cheese.
Vinny, get your ass over here.
He's weeded.
He's weeded bad.
What do you need?
Two macaronis!
Get him two macaronis.
Let's go!
It doesn't matter.
Now you do, so don't put up dog [Bleep].
So if he's not ready, then [Bleep] Him!
I'll send it separate, okay?
Service, please.
Come on, guys.Together.
In England, we eat at the same [Bleep] Time.
Come on, Rob.
It's my family.
My son's still waiting for the macaroni and cheese.
Now I'm worried now.
Here we go again.
Dinner service is going horrible.
[Bleep] You.
Rob, come on!
Come on!
Rob, move your ass!
Hurry up!
(Announcer) Two hours into dinner service, and almost everyone in the Ramsay family has their entree.
My son's still waiting for the macaroni and cheese.
In England, we eat at the same time.
(Russell) It's Mac and cheese, bro.
It's not steak.
It's not chicken.
It's easy.
Come on, Rob.
Yes, chef.
Service.
(Announcer) Rob has finally completed the Ramsay's table.
And in the red kitchen...
Here's your chicken.
This is hot, okay?
(Announcer) Sabrina and Trev have put their differences aside long enough to entrees.
Let's go.
Yes, chef.
(Announcer) Now both teams work to complete their final tickets.
Push this out, guys.
We're gonna fight back.
Service, please.
Go, please.
We got our groove on.
We got our sync on.
(Gordon) Delicious, delicious, delicious.
Working, working, working.
We start hustling, and we're going.
We're banging away.
Hot behind.
(Gordon) Service, please.
Keep it going.
Let's go, let's go, let's go.
We started rough...
Gail, this speed and accuracy is amazing.
Keep it up.
Yes, chef.
But we finished strong.
Last table.
(Gail) One milkshake, one chocolate cake.
(Gordon) Service, please.
Hallelujah.
It's the best thing in the whole wide world?
(Gordon) Good.
Switch off.
Clear down.
Let's get through this very quickly, yes?
I cannot believe what we did.
I said I wanted customers to be happy and you know what?
90% from our customer comment cards...
Said they left...
Happy.
Well done.
[applause]
Thank you, chef.
Finally, finally, finally.
How did it feel?
Great, chef.
Awesome.
Now, unfortunately, elimination has to take place.
[Bleep].
Each team-- blue team, red team-- come up with two suggestions based on what you saw from tonight's service.
Think hard.
Clear?
(All) Yes, chef.
Upstairs.
We did good, and, like, we have to nominate two people to go up for elimination.
It sucks.
So who's the two that we're gonna nominate?
Did anything get sent back?
A chicken.
You were helping me on chicken, Trevor, so if I go up, you should too.
(Trev) Wow.
Sabrina, he was helping you out.
Every time, "check this.
Check this.
Check this."
I was trying to help you out.
You just threw me under the bus.
Thanks.
You just made one vote easy--
Sabrina.
(Jillian) I agree.
That's it.
Sabrina's on her way home.
If you are gonna [Bleep] Me, guess what.
I'm gonna [Bleep] You right back.
We already know one.
It sucks, but, Nona, without help, you would have died tonight.
What Trev said is about right.
I struggled, but I--
I didn't get anything sent back.
I busted my ass tonight.
I don't want to go home.
(Gail) Nona struggled.
She pulled us down during service tonight.
We were behind 'cause of the garnish station.
Just go up there and fight.
He ain't gonna send you home, girl.
You got it.
Guys, I've been up on the chopping block three times, and to be quite honest with you,
I really don't feel like going up there again.
[Scoffs] So what you're saying is
I should just vote myself up because you've gone up three times and put myself in danger.
Seems like suicide.
We're not stupid, Boris.
The weakest team member is Boris.
He can kiss his Russian ass good-bye.
Boris has to go home.
I'm not going home.
I don't deserve to go.
I'm not ready to go home.
I'm gonna fight till the last drop of sweat.
I'm voting for Vinny.
Okay, so do what you got to do, but I got no business going up there tonight.
I made one mistake, and I corrected the mistake quick, and it turned out to really not be that big of a deal.
The two people that were getting yelled at the most tonight were Boris and Rob.
I have no choice but to vote for the two of you.
Mm-Hmm.
I don't feel like I should go up there either.
I [Bleep] Worked my ass off.
I thought Russell could have slid.
He saw me fighting the whole night by myself on garnish.
[Bleep] Damn!
I understand.
Listen, Russell, based on what I'm feeling,
I felt a little slide could have been warranted here and there.
[Bleep] Damn, bro.
Russell, I feel like, should be the one up there.
He could have slid over and helped me, but he decided not to do that.
I got [Bleep] Peppered there.
So that's your votes.
Fine.
That's fine.
Whatever.
[Sighs]
Tough one, this one.
Very tough.
Nona, red team's first nominee, and why?
Uh, first nomination tonight is...
Sabrina...
For lack of communication and teamwork throughout the service.
Second nominee, and why, please?
The second nomination is myself, chef.
And why?
Based on tonight's performance,
I was in the weeds pretty much the whole night.
Okay.
Blue team.
Russell, first nominee, and why, please?
Our first nominee is, uh, Boris.
He didn't pull his weight tonight, and it still is not getting into his head, so he needs to go home.
Wow.
Second nominee, and why?
Second nominee is...
Rob.
Rob was buried all night, and, you know, everyone was trying to help him, and he clearly buried us.
Okay, I asked you for two suggestions, and I'm gonna take one from each team.
From the red...
Nona, step forward.
From the blue...
Rob.
(Announcer) Both teams completed dinner service, but had to nominate two of their own for elimination.
The red team put up Sabrina and Nona.
The blue team, Boris and Rob.
Then chef Ramsay...
I'm gonna take one from each team.
(Announcer) Narrowed the field.
Nona and Rob, step forward.
Right, Nona, are you the next chef for the L.A. market?
Yes, chef.
I'm not convinced.
Tell me why you think you should stay in Hell's Kitchen.
I'm a hell of a team player.
I give everything I've got.
I fight, I push back, and I never give up.
I put my head down, and I fight through it.
Something quite humble and honest about you.
I just need to see this fight.
Rob, tell me why you think you should stay in Hell's Kitchen.
Chef, I know tonight was a rough night, but I fought through it way to the end, and I never stopped fighting.
I got zero support on that station.
I fought all the way through it.
You had no support?
So, yes, I was alone on the station.
Russell, is that true that he had no support?
Absolutely not, chef.
I can't do everything on the station for him, chef, at the end of the day.
That's not how it went, chef, really, honestly, and everybody knows that.
I mean, I just felt like Russell definitely had, you know, an opportunity to step over and slide, and I just think he just stayed the speed limit and didn't floor it for us tonight.
I worked hard.
I dug deep, and I did the best I could with what I had.
Okay.
I thought long and hard about this.
My decision is...
Rob.
Because it's filthy dirty.
This one is a clean one.
Get it on.
Get back in line.
Nona, back in line.
Both of you, hey, relax.
It was a good service.
Why should anyone go home?
[laughter]
Really?
What?
You can't do that to a fat guy, chef.
It was a great service.
Oh, my God.
After six horrible services, we finally cracked it on service seven.
Yes, chef!
Thank you very much.
Yes?
My God, yes?
Well done.
Well done.
Well done.
Well done.
Jeez.
Thank you, chef.
Glad to have you back.
I pushed you guys to the very limit, and you cracked it, so tonight you all get a pass.
But let me tell you something.
We will not be getting another one.
Get a really good night's sleep, because tomorrow it's gonna be a bitch.
Good night.
Get some sleep.
Thank you, chef.
Good night.
Rob, I can feel that heart beating from here.
[Bleep] Me, man.
That was insane.
I plan on never being in that [Bleep] Position again.
Nona, when we go down, we bounce back.
Yes, chef.
I've got to step it up.
I want the L.A. market.
I want this.
I want this for myself.
I want this for my family.
I want to win it.
(Boris) I'm not going anywhere.
I refuse to die.
I refuse to go home.
There's only three ways I can leave-- dead, a winner, or arrested.
I'm definitely not planning on getting arrested.
(Gordon) Tonight I finally got a respectable service, so I gave them a little respect and didn't send anyone home.
But tomorrow they're in for the most intense dinner service in the history of Hell's Kitchen.
(Announcer) The winner of Hell's Kitchen will become head chef of the brand-new multimillion-dollar restaurant, L.A. Market, at the J.W. Marriott hotel in downtown Los Angeles.
The salary--a quarter of a million dollars.
[Cheers and applause]
(Announcer) And they will also tour the country as the official spokesperson of rosemount estate winery.
Next time, it's a dinner service unlike any other.
It is our 100th service.
(Announcer) It's a Hell's Kitchen milestone and you won't believe who's coming to dinner.
Who's coming out that limo?
I'm getting real excited.
[Cheers and applause]
Good to see you guys.
(Announcer) Chef Ramsay wants nothing less than perfection.
Raise the bar now.
You stay above it.
(Announcer) And he's more intense...
Stop panicking!
Just [Bleep] Focus!
(Announcer) Than ever.
Wake up!
I would love some help!
[Bleep] Off.
Don't do this to me tonight.
(Announcer) Sabrina and Trev battle all night in the kitchen...
Help me!
I am!
Don't [Bleep] Get on my ass!
(Announceren in the d.
You're a bitch.
(Announcer) They have the showdown you've been waiting for.
Don't start on me.
I own my [Bleep] Station!
Whatever!
(Announcer) And when it comes time to send someone home...
Take your jacket off!
(Announcer) Chef Ramsay feels he needs to do something drastic.
I'm not finished yet.
Get your ass up here.
(Announcer) You don't want to miss the 100th dinner service...
[Bleep] Pissed.
(Announcer) Next time on a special edition of Hell's Kitchen.
(Gordon) My customers deserve the best.
What a letdown.
I could?
Yeah, ok.
Yeah.
2:30 is actually better for me, so, yeah, ok.
That's a personal call, is it?
Uh, can I call you back?
Thanks.
Bye.
How's the job hunt going?
It's a little tougher than you thought, is it, or...
All right, well, carry on.
Keep up the good work.
What?
All I was trying to say in there was, you know,
I want him on the street getting a life, not in there getting a latte.
Why don't you just tell him that, then?
And spoil all the fun?
Do me a favor.
Show me it.
Uh-oh.
This is Juan Ramirez, street name Prince John, of the Nine-Six clique.
Push in tighter.
That's, uh, Detective, uh...
What's his name again?
Farr.
Murderous hatred.
What happens next?
So what part of you is thinking "I told you so"?
Internal Affairs.
They've been watching Wallowski for a while.
Apparently it's not uncommon to run surveillance on gang unit cops.
You got this from I.A.?
They came to me with it, because of your relationship with Wallowski, which somehow they know about.
All right, look at her.
She's pissed off.
At her partner.
She tried to stop him.
It could be argued that she did that once the other cops arrived on the scene.
It could also be argued that you thought having a compromised cop in your pocket was a good idea and there was nothing I could do or say to warn you.
This is a message to you from Internal Affairs.
Your new friend Wallowski is under the microscope.
And they want me to stay out of it.
You want me to stay out of it.
Dr. Lightman.
What do you want?
Every cop in the city have passed their fitness test.
Police range.
Police personnel only.
What's Prince John got on you that makes you want to kill him, eh?
Have a nice day.
It's not so much fun killing cardboard, is it?
Let me guess.
You've seen the video.
Yeah.
You want to know how I got it?
I.A. gave me that tape.
Now, why would they be watching you, do you think, in your humble opinion?
What you saw on that tape is my partner subduing a suspect.
Trying to kill him, more like.
Corner kids like Prince John, they keep guns in the wheel Wells of nearby cars.
He was going for a hidden gun.
Oh, so where's the gun now, then, in a police evidence locker somewhere?
You working with I.A. Now?
If I was, you'd be in the cop shop.
Answer a simple question-- what's going on between you and your partner?
What are you hiding?
You know, you do that whole tough guy cop thing really well, but do me a favor--save it for the customers, all right?
Look, Prince John, he's a mid-level dealer with the Nine-Sixes.
All right.
So if there was a reason to arrest him yesterday, what's he doing on the street today, then?
Herman Farr is a good man, period.
What your partner did on that tape is the beginning of the end for both of you.
What do you care?
I'm just the cop that you like to squeeze on the street, in the sack, wherever.
In the sack?
That's a bit previous, isn't it?
That beating was personal.
Prince John has something on your partner, and you know exactly what it is.
Which makes you a target as well.
I can take care of myself, thank you.
Give us a go, then.
You know, you do need my help.
You just don't know how to ask for it.
Do you?
All right.
Hey.
Easy, tiger.
I'll drive.

Vigilante Five-O pigs.
It's Prince John, right?
Do you know what a prince is where I come from?
What did you say?
No--well, that as well.
But I wasn't talking about your sexual preferences.
A prince, where I come from, is a burden on the taxpayer.
Settle.
She's been practicing.
Beat it, snow?
What's she gonna find on you if she pats you down, eh?
Seriously.
What's she gonna plant on him, you mean?
Eight ball with your name on it in this pocket right here.
Ask your question.
Go on.
What you got on my partner?
I know he's fat.
You see, I think you can do better than that, really.
Mm-Hmm.
Don't you, Wallowski?
You know the drill.
I mean, we gotta go.
I'll be back.
You be all right?
Let's go.
That tune-up that Detective Farr gave you, was personal, right?
So that means either you have unfinished business or Detective Farr's on the take.
Or, you've got something he wants.
Tune-up?
Nah.
Well, I got it.
Option 2.
Detective Farr's on the take.
That's not news to you.
What-- you gonna take his word over a decorated cop?
That was no ordinary beating.
Farr wanted to kill him.
Which is why the Prince here is on the run.
What, you see me running?
My advice to you...
Dust off your sneakers...
Princess.
We done?
I need a ride home.
Well...
Protect and serve.
This is the serve part.
We found that Wallowski has a number of interesting reactions.
Pursed lips and puffed cheeks indicate resignation.
Widened eyes show fear.
Oh, yeah?
We're breaking down the videos into micro-expressions.
I'll break you down into micro-expressions in a minute.
Put your hand on your heart and tell me you think Wallowski's clean.
What, you mean clean like you?
Give us the room.
Now, look, I didn't mean that in a bad way.
I know what you meant.
Have a seat.
Now what, nurse?
You came up on I.A.'s radar the minute you and Wallowski decided to start seeing each other.
That's a business meeting, that.
I don't have an ax to grind against her, Cal,
I really don't.
You just don't trust my judgment where she's concerned, huh?
I don't want to see you get hurt.
Yeah.
Right.
It's a little late for that now.
For what?
I'm up to my neck in it.
Come on.
Prince John.
I dropped him off an hour ago.
Dr. Foster?
Can I have a word?
This isn't happening.
Did he do this?
He didn't say.
Does he know who did this?
If he did, we wouldn't be standing here talking about it.
Did you ask him?
He's a city cop 20 years.
You asked him.
Your worst nightmare-- he lied to you.
Incoming.
Detective Wallowski,
Internal Affairs.
Jenkins.
Weapon, please, Detective.
Or do you want me to arrest you out here?
Arrest her for what?
That.
On what evidence?
Eyewitness.
So I'm thinking, I distract the guards, and you start digging.
You got a spoon on you?
Or you could tell me the truth about Farr.
I'll get you out that way.
Look, Farr didn't kill Prince John.
You and I lifted him, an hour later he's back on the street, and that's why he's dead.
You don't believe that.
So I bit my lip.
Give me a break.
If one of those gang-bangers thinks you killed Prince John, this is the worst possible place you could be, love.
Mind if I speak with my partner now?
I'll get you that spoon.
What took you so long?
She's never gonna rat out her partner.
I mean, you can offer her any deal you like.
It's not going to happen.
Uh-huh.
So that's your science speaking, is it?
You need me.
Badly.
This is a department investigation, Dr. Lightman.
Do you want to look good for your career, or do you want to get this right and look even better?
If you are gaming me,
I will flush you down the toilet.
You and Wallowski.
Bollocks.
You got an innocent cop sitting in jail with a target on her back.
Wallowski's there because we have an eyewitness murder with no alibi.
You look me in the eye and you tell me you don't have skeletons.
'Cause you know if I start looking, I'll find them.
What do you want?
Detective Farr.
But...
Not here.
At my place.
My comfort zone, not yours.
And when you find dirt on that woman, Wallowski, which I know there is?
"That woman"?
Is that your science talking now?
Then you'll give her to me, too.
Woman, on tape:
I just saw a boy shot, 95th and Chalmers.
White lady cop threw him out her car, then started shooting.
Male 911 dispatcher:
And you said an officer was involved?
Wachowski, Willinski...
Something like that.
Works the gangs up here.
I thought I took your desk away.
This is the 911 tape of the eyewitness.
She has an evasive vocal tic.
The throat clearing-- she did it when she was making statements about Detective Wallowski.
Did you come up with this all by yourself?
And, if you listen to the tape in its entirety...
It was definitely her.
I recognized...
She gives unnecessary details.
Not answering questions directly.
She's lying.
Maybe she's just old.
Look, you keep doing that.
And it just gets funnier and funnier.
Where'd you get the 911 tape from, hey?
You're not the only one with police contacts.
What, Loker?
Afraid so.
Next time, however, will you run it by me first?
That throat clearing-- it's phlegm--she's a smoker.
African coffee.
Best on the planet.
Is that your son in there, Mrs. Phillips?
Oh, lord, no.
Grandson.
Louis.
He lives with me.
How do you take it?
A splash of milk, 2 sugars.
That's me.
Where in Africa?
Kenya.
Mrs. Phillips:
I know a guy knows a guy...
Second man:
Watch that chopper!
You trying to make your grandma deaf?
Leave her out of this.
Leave her out of what?
You a cop.
I can smell.
How old are you, then?
Nice ink, that.
That's the Nine-Sixes, is it?
You know, the proud, the few.
However it goes.
Comedian cop.
You just play your game.
You don't mind me, all right?
How about over here?
And whoever killed Prince John,
I wouldn't breathe a word about that if I were you.
I don't know nothin' about that.
Well, that's smart.
You see, you keep your mouth shut, you pick your side in this war carefully, 'cause you never know, right?
Next time it could be you, couldn't it?
Beat it, snow.
Damn.
I'd get that if I were you.
You never leave home without it, right?
Oh, yeah, 'cause I'm that stupid.
Keep it.
I'm straight.
Snow.
I'm beginning to like that.
It's growing on me.
Very creative, that.
I'm going over to Ronnie's house, grandma.
Be home for dinner.
It's your favorite.
Ronnie's house, my ass.
Here.
Merry Christmas.
It's a firing pin.
Just so long as he comes home is all.
Yeah.
What was I saying?
The shooting.
Prince John.
Yes.
I'm 110% certain it was the Wallowski girl who shot him.
I might be old, but I'm not blind.
You know, there's many different kinds of blindness.
Blind is blind.
Right, yeah.
Well, thanks for your time, Mrs. Phillips.
That's it?
What about your coffee?
Rain check.
Hi, mate.
Louis, I thought you was on your way to Ronnie's.
You lost?
Oh, look at you.
Lovely.
Matching ink.
You guys must really, really like each other.
Or something.
Not that there's anything wrong with that.
It's ok.
Good evening, all.
Another day in D.C., Professor.
Whew.
Blimey.
Well, at least your partner's got an alibi this time.
You know, her being in jail and that.
Who was he?
His street name's Stomper.
Local pharmaceutical rep for the Nine-Sixes.
Who's that one?
Hey?
What's he smiling about, eh?
He's not smiling.
Come on, calm down.
It's not a capital offense, you know.
Disperse those clowns.
What, you mean lift 'em, right?
I mean, they know the dead guy.
They're all in the same gang together.
Now, listen.
How you doin', mate?
Who's that one over there?
Oh.
He's that dangerous, is he?
How does Detective Farr know him?
Hit me in the stomach.
Back off, man.
Is he one of the ones grabbing for power?
Is he?
You hit me in the stomach, I'll pay you $50, with a smile.
Which one's gonna make you look better?
You're crazy.
Look, whoever killed Prince John killed your friend over there.
Right?
Who was it?
Not that lady cop.
Thanks for that.
All right, stomach, not face, all right?
Ohh!
That's cold.
Did you see that?
You ok?
Oh, no, I'm fine.
Cal.
You tell your I.A. friend
I want to talk to that one there.
All right?
This isn't a gang war.
It's more like a gang at war with itself.
And he knows it.
He's part of it, he is.
He's even picked sides.
Two Nine-Sixes in two days, Suarez.
Busy man.
First off, he's not a man, so try "boy."
See what I mean?
You Call this science?
Well, it sells books, you know?
Ask him why he's so happy his own gang members are dead.
Speak.
You got nothin' on me.
The lady cop killed Prince John and set him up.
Why are you lying about her?
Do you need her out of the way?
You need her where she's easier to get to.
Right?
Inside.
I'm with you.
Killing cops is serious business.
Lawyer.
No need.
You're free to go.
Get out of here.
Hello.
You know him, do you?
I work gangs.
He's in a gang.
You seem exceptionally relieved to see him walking out of here a free man.
Let me guess.
He asked for a lawyer.
You've interviewed him, have you?
A few times, yeah.
Always with Wallowski?
I got one for you.
Did you tell Wallowski you were on the I.A. payroll when you started doing her?
And why have you kept me waiting out here?
No reason.
You can go now.
I want interrogation tape on him and Wallowski and any other Nine-Sixes.
Get out of here.
I would, but I got work to do.
Let me ask you something.
Is this about catching corrupt cops for you, or is this about saving your friend?
Because I still have an eyewitness.
So you were 2 blocks away when you heard the shots.
Is that right?
Why don't you let him tell us where he was.
I was 2 blocks away.
So in this one,
Farr is controlling the interrogation.
He's warning Suarez.
And then the next one.
We put you there.
We got witnesses.
We know J.T. has a beef with you.
We just want to hear your side of the story, that's all.
I need a break.
You finish this.
Wallowski walks out before the interrogation is over.
Well, they've been in there for 3 hours.
I mean, maybe she just needed a tinkle.
Or maybe she was letting Farr blow the interrogation.
Is there anything here you agree on?
Yes.
There's definitely some kind of relationship between Detective Farr and Suarez.
Agreed.
Farr does sound compromised at times.
Well, if Farr's dirty, Wallowski's dirty.
What's that?
What is that, guilt by association?
You may.
May I remind you-- you've got an eyewitness.
I haven't forgotten.
Wallowski's arraigned in the morning.
My hands are tied.
She goes to county, that's a death sentence.
Well, she either gives up her partner or she's on her own.
Thanks for your help.
Oh, you wanted me to lie.
I see now.
Mrs. Phillips, are you comfortable?
I saw what I saw.
Let's just get on with it, shall we?
Ok, we just have a quick video we'd like you to take a look at.
And when I turn it off, just give us as much detail about it as you can.
There were 3 people.
A couple holding hands, an old man in a ball cap, and a blue car parked.
Do you know what change blindness is, Mrs. Phillips?
Changed what?
Change blindness.
We see what we anticipate we're going to see, even if it changes.
The brain doesn't react to the change.
Right.
Like Charles here.
This was actually Loker just a minute ago.
So, you saw Wallowski drop Prince John off, but did you look away for any time before the shooting started?
I...
I think I was brewing coffee.
And then when the shooting started, you looked out the window, you saw the shooter, right?
Who you thought was the same person you saw with Prince John just moments earlier.
I was about to bring you that spoon.
How did you get me out?
Change blindness.
What you lookin' at, Flaco?
Lovely weather we're having.
I'm not talking about Farr.
Balmy for this time of year.
You want me to talk about Farr 'cause you're working with I.A., right?
That's how you got me out of jail, you're working some kind of deal?
Right.
Well, that's that out of the way, then.
Where do we go now?
Straight to sex?
Look, you know he's dirty, right?
It's not exactly breaking his heart selling you out, by the way.
What if he was?
And I'm not saying that he is.
Is what?
Dirty.
You just said it.
There are two types of dirty.
One is who you are and one happens to you.
Oh, Farr's a victim.
Do me a favor.
Want to know how it happens?
How what happens?
Corruption.
You did it again.
I'm too tired for this.
Well, humor me.
I brought the wine.
So we isolated some of her reactions during the Suarez interrogation.
First interview-- after a softball from Farr, she purses her lips, barely noticeable.
5 months later, she looks away, brow furrows, much more intense reaction.
In an interrogation last year, you see disgust around her nose, on her mouth.
And finally 6 weeks ago, her entire body shifts away from Farr and she leaves the room.
So, in terms of intensity, her disgust with Farr rises from an "a" to an "e"
in lock-step with Suarez's crimes.
As he went from joyriding to homicide.
She's known all along that Suarez and Farr had some kind of deal.
Lightman's watched all of these interviews.
How could he miss this?
Change blindness.
That's not bad for 7 bucks, eh?
You know about wine?
It's made from grapes.
What do you do when your partner busts a 14-year-old with a few grams of heroin?
You send them to juvie for a PhD.
In criminology or cut 'em a break?
I don't know.
You tell me.
You start small.
You just fudge some paperwork here and there.
Knock a banger around a bit, get a shooter out of him.
You know, that's all very interesting.
But not one mention of Detective Farr.
I'm trying to tell you, you get deep enough in, you can't get back out.
You know, two dead bodies is a world away from fudging a bit of paperwork, darlin', really.
So...
Get on with it, then.
Candles?
Cabinet.

How long you gonna pretend there's nothing going on between Suarez and Farr?
You want to talk about this now?
The I.A. leaned on my partner to lean on me to give you up.
Now, I'm being disloyal to my partner because you're being loyal to a man who's up to his neck in it.
You're saying Dr. Foster's wrong about me?
Like she's wrong about me sometimes.
It comes from a good place.
You ever hear of off-duty Booty?
Suarez is Farr's son.
I wouldn't do that if I were you, mate.
You.
Raises the blood pressure, you know?
I me, if you want a "get out of jail free" pass from the I.A., you might want to get it under control, mate.
All right, suit yourself.
But it does make your neck blob out a bit, you know?
Oh, yeah.
Wallowski?
Well, you can stick a fork in her and all, 'cause she's cooked.
You both are.
Did you know that someone shot up her house last night?
Oh, first you've heard of it.
Well, that's a good sign, I suppose.
You want to know who it was?
It was your boy Suarez.
And when I say your boy, what I mean is, your son.
19 years old.
Mowing his way through his own gang while you look the other way.
You ok?
I'm good.
And so is Suarez.
It starts simple.
Right?
You're just trying to do the right thing, like any real dad would.
You can't protect him anymore.
He tried killing you last night.
Choose.
Your partner...
Or your son.
Detective Farr.
Get me Lightman.
Now.
He's not in yet.
Well, he bends Farr's ear before the hearing,
Farr comes in and spills.
Suarez is his son.
He's been in the kid's pocket for years.
So you got your dirty cop.
Congratulations.
Farr's son killed Prince John and Stomper because he knew they were blackmailing Farr.
And Wallowski knew it, too.
She's dirty.
I mean, 8-hour days with Farr for 5 years?
It doesn't sound like proof.
Farr takes the heat, says Wallowski knows nothing.
Lying through his teeth, and Lightman put him up to it.
Oh, this isn't about Wallowski anymore, is it?
It's about Lightman.
You can choose--
Wallowski or your partner.
Because I will bring down this whole circus act if I have to.
Understand?
Do you need that in writing?
Her contempt for Farr's choices is getting harder to contain.
She knew about Suarez.
And you're sure about that?
Put her in the cube for long enough, and if she's guilty, she'll betray herself.
The muscles in your cheek, relax them.
No, no.
Hands down.
You cover your mouth, you give yourself away.
You know, if you teach me how to lie, you might never be able to trust me.
All right, pay attention.
Focus on what we're doing.
You're not helping me.
You're just trying to save yourself now.
That was good.
You hid the contempt.
There are 4 key emotions displayed here.
Disappointment, frustration, disgust, outrage.
And just like contempt, any of these would expose Wallowski's role in covering up Farr's crimes.
And you can show me what to look for?
And what to ask.
Ask her a question she doesn't expect.
That's where you'll find unfiltered emotion, something she won't be able to hide.
You knew there was a relationship between Farr and Suarez.
They were friendly.
Part of our work with gang unit is to connect with these kids.
But I had no idea until yesterday they were father and son.
Oh, that's good.
Nice.
Lying comes naturally to you.
Good teacher.
Just part your lips a little for surprise, you know.
They'll be looking for that.
I don't know if I can do this.
Of course you can.
I can't lose the one cop I can squeeze, on the street.
Tell me a lie.
Anything you like.
I hate you.
Now, that's brilliant.
You're ready.
You knew Detective Farr had a relationship with Marco Suarez?
We're meant to form relationships with street-level dealers.
But did you know he was helping Suarez commit crimes?
No.
I didn't know anything about that.
But you do know that he beat Prince John to cover his relationship with Suarez, to support Suarez's move to control the Nine-Sixes.
Now that he's confessed, sure, I guess.
Was Detective Farr a good father to his children?
Which ones?
To his regular family ones.
You mean his white ones.
Don't deflect the question, Detective.
I'm sorry, what was the question again?
Oh, yeah.
Uh, he's incredible with his kids.
Well, don't look at me, Loker.
Give it to them straight.
I get nothing here.
Zip.
Was Wallowski in on this with Farr or not?
She's been coached.
Or maybe she's clean.
And you Call yourself scientists?
You call cops who disagree cops?
Unless one of them's dirty.
Well, she's saying Wallowski's clean.
Aren't you, Dr. Foster?
Wait!
What are you walking away for, hey?
That's not right.
Don't do that.
Never mind.
I'm not going anywhere, Gill, so let's have it.
What do you see in her, Cal?
I'd have done the same thing for my partner.
It's called loyalty.
That's kind of ironic from where I'm standing.
Well?
Is Wallowski lying?
Yes.
Absolutely.
Farr is not a good dad.
She's covering for him.
As for the rest of it, she's not lying.
She didn't know anything about Suarez or any of it.
D--Dr.
Lightman?
Yeah, she's clean.

How's the job hunt going?
A little tougher than you thought or...?
- Well, carry on.
Keep up the good work.
- Ahem.
What?
All I was trying to say in there was, you know I want him on the street getting a life, not in there getting a latte.
Why don't you just tell him that, then?
And spoil all the fun?
Do me a favor.
What's wrong with you?
Uh-oh.
This is Juan Ramirez, street name, Prince John of the 9-6 Click.
Push in tighter.
That's, uh, Detective, uh...
What's his name again?
Farr.
Murderous hatred.
What happens next?
So no part of you is thinking, "I told you so," huh?
Internal Affairs.
They've been watching Wallowski for a while.
It's not uncommon to run surveillance on Gang Unit cops.
- Got this from IA?
- They came to me because of your relationship with Wallowski, which they know about.
All right.
Look at her.
She's pissed off at her partner.
She tried to stop him.
It could be argued that she did that once the other cops arrived.
It could also be argued that you thought having a compromised cop was a good idea and there was nothing I could do or say to warn you.
This is a message to you from Internal Affairs.
Your new friend, Wallowski, is under the microscope.
And they want me to stay out of it.
You want me to stay out of it.
Dr. Lightman.
What do you want?
Every cop in the city have passed their fitness test.
Police range.
Police personnel only.
What's Prince John got on you that makes you wanna kill him?
Have a nice day.
It's not so much fun killing cardboard, is it?
Let me guess.
You've seen the video.
Yeah.
You wanna know how I got it?
IA gave me that tape.
Now, why would they be watching you, do you think, in your humble opinion?
What you saw on that tape is my partner subduing a suspect.
Trying to kill him, more like.
Kids like Prince John, they keep guns in the wheel wells of nearby cars.
He was going for a hidden gun.
Oh, so where's the gun now then, in a police evidence locker somewhere?
You working with IA now?
If I was, you'd be at the cop shop.
Answer me.
What's going on between you and your partner?
What are you hiding?
You know, you do that whole tough-guy-cop thing really well.
But do me a favor, save it for the customers, all right?
Look, he's a mid-level dealer with the 9-6s.
All right.
So if there was a reason to arrest him yesterday what's he doing on the street today?
Herman Farr is a good man, period.
What your partner did on that tape is the beginning of the end for both of you.
What do you care?
I'm just the cop you like to squeeze on the street, in the sack.
In the sack?
That's a bit previous, isn't it?
That beating was personal.
Prince John has something on your partner, and you know exactly what it is.
Which makes you a target.
I can take care of myself.
Thank you.
Give this a go, then.
You know, you do need my help.
You just don't know how to ask for it, do you?
- All right.
- Hey.
Easy, tiger.
I'll drive.
Dream Send me a sign
Turn back the clock Give me some time
I need to break out Make a new name
Let's open our eyes To the brand-new day
Let's make this quick.
Check it out.
Vigilante five-0 bitch.
It's Prince John, right?
Do you know what a prince is where I come from?
- What did you say?
- No...
Yeah, but I wasn't talking about your sexual preference.
A prince, where I come from, is a burden on a taxpayer.
Settle.
She's been practicing.
Beat it, snow.
What's she gonna find on you if she pats you down, eh?
Seriously.
What's she gonna plant on him, you mean?
Eight ball with your name on it in this pocket right here.
Ask your question.
Go on.
What you got on my partner?
- I know he's fat.
- That's true.
Ha, ha.
You see, I think you can do better than that, really.
- Don't you, Wallowski?
- Mm-hm.
You know the drill.
- Oh, seriously.
- It means we gotta go.
- I'll be back.
- Speak up, all right.
Let's go.
That tune-up that Detective Farr gave you, was personal, right?
So that means either you have unfinished business or Detective Farr is on the take.
Or you got something he wants.
- Tune-up?
- Yeah.
No.
Well, I got it.
Option two, Detective Farr is on the take.
That's not news to you.
You're gonna take his word over a decorated cop?
That was no ordinary beating.
All right, Farr wanted to kill him.
- Which is why the prince here is on the run.
- What, you see me running?
My advice to you dust off your sneakers, princess.
We done?
I need a ride home.
Well, protect and serve.
This is the serve bit.
The good news is Wallowski doesn't have much of a poker face.
Pursed lips and puffed cheeks indicate resignation.
Widened eyes show fear.
Oh, yeah?
We're breaking down the videos into microexpressions.
I'll break you down into microexpressions in a minute.
Put your hand on your heart and tell me you think Wallowski's clean.
What, you mean clean like you?
Give us the room.
Now, look, I didn't mean that in a bad way.
I know what you meant.
Have a seat.
Now what, nurse?
You came up on IA's radar the minute you and Wallowski...
- ...decided to start seeing each other.
- That's a business meeting.
I don't have an ax to grind against her, I don't.
You don't trust my judgment where she's concerned.
- I don't wanna see you get hurt.
- Yeah.
All right.
- It's a little late for that now.
- For what?
I'm up to my neck in it.
Come on.
Oh, yeah, copy that.
- North, he's heading it up from here.
- Yeah, the gun was in the back...
- Prince John.
- I dropped him off an hour ago.
Dr. Foster, can I have a word?
This isn't happening.
- Did he do this?
- He didn't say.
Does he know who did this?
If he did, he wouldn't be standing here talking about it.
- Did you ask him?
- He's a city cop, 20 years.
You asked him.
Your worst nightmare, he lied to you.
Incoming.
Detective Wallowski, Internal Affairs, Jenkins.
Weapon, please, detective.
What?
Or do you want me to arrest you here?
Arrest her for what?
That.
On what evidence?
Eyewitness.
Open the gate.
So I'm thinking, I distract the guards, and you start digging.
You got a spoon on you?
Well, we got some place here.
Or you could tell me the truth about Farr, huh?
I'll get you out that way.
Look, Farr didn't kill Prince John.
You and I lifted him, an hour later he's back on the street, that's why he's dead.
You don't believe that.
So I bit my lip.
Give me a break.
If one of those gangbangers think you killed Prince John this is the worst possible place you could be, love.
Mind if I speak with my partner now?
I'll get you that spoon.
What took you so long?
She's never gonna rat out her partner.
I mean, you can offer any deal you like, it's not gonna happen.
Uh-huh.
So that's your science speaking, is it?
You need me.
- Badly.
- Ha, ha.
This is a department investigation, Dr. Lightman.
Do you wanna look good or do you wanna get this right and look even better?
If you are gaming me, I will flush you down the toilet.
You and Wallowski.
Bollocks.
You got an innocent cop sitting in jail with a target on her back.
Wallowski is there because we have an eyewitness, motive and no alibi.
You look me in the eye and you tell me you don't have skeletons.
Because, you know, if I start looking, I'll find them.
- What do you want?
- Detective Farr.
But not here.
At my place.
My comfort zone, not his.
When you find dirt on that woman, Wallowski, which I know there is...
That woman?
Is that your science talking now?
...then you'll give her to me too.
I just saw a boy shot, 95th and Chalmers.
White lady cop threw him out her car, then started shooting.
- And you said an officer was involved?
- Wachowski, Willinski...
Something like that.
Works the gangs up here.
I thought I took your desk away.
This is the 911 tape of the eyewitness.
Has an evasive vocal tic.
The throat clearing she did it when she was making statements about Wallowski.
Did you come up with this all by yourself?
And if you listen to the tape in its entirety...
It was definitely her.
She gives unnecessary details.
Not answering questions directly.
She's lying.
Maybe she's just old.
Look, you keep doing that.
And it just gets funnier and funnier.
Where did you get the 911 tape from then, eh?
You're not the only one with contacts.
- What, Loker?
- Afraid so.
Next time, however, will you run it by me first?
That throat clearing, it's phlegm.
She's a smoker.
African coffee, best on the planet.
Is that your son in there, Mrs. Phillips?
Oh, Lord, no.
Grandson.
Luis.
He lives with me.
How do you take it?
A splash of milk, two sugars.
That's me.
Where in Africa?
Kenya.
- Exploding bomb.
- Watch that chopper.
- You trying to make your grandma deaf?
- Leave her out of this.
Leave her out of what?
You're a cop.
I can smell.
How old are you, then?
Nice ink, that.
That's the 9-6s, is it?
You know, the proud, the few.
However it goes.
Comedian cop.
You just play your game.
You don't mind me, all right?
- How about over here?
- Again.
Stop there.
And whoever killed Prince John, I wouldn't breathe a word about that if I were you.
I know nothing about that.
Smart.
Keep your mouth shut.
You pick your side in this war carefully, you never know.
- Next time it could be you, couldn't it?
- Beat it, snow.
Watch it!
I'll get that if I were you.
So you never leave home without it, right?
Oh, yeah, because I look that stupid.
Keep it.
I'm straight.
Snow, I'm beginning to like that.
- It's growing on me.
Very creative.
- I'm going to Ronnie's house.
Be home for dinner.
It's your favorite.
Ronnie's house, my ass.
Here.
Merry Christmas.
It's a firing pin.
Just so long as he comes home, is all.
Right.
- What was I saying?
- The shooting.
- Prince John.
- Yes.
I'm 110 percent certain it was the Wallowski girl who shot him.
I might be old, but I'm not blind.
You know, there's many different kinds of blindness.
Blind is blind.
Right, yeah.
Well, thanks for your time, Mrs. Phillips.
- That's it?
What about your coffee?
- Rain check.
Hey, what's up, Bo?
Hi, mate.
Luis.
I thought you was on your way to Ronnie's.
You lost?
Oh, look at you lot, eh?
Matching ink.
You guys must really, really like each other.
Or something.
Not that there's anything wrong with that.
It's okay.
Leave that now.
Another day in D.C., professor.
Oh, blimey.
West station by South.
I believe in the west.
Your partner has got an alibi this time, her being in jail.
- Who was he?
- His street name is Stomper.
Local pharmaceutical rep for the 9-6s.
Who's that one?
Who's that one, eh?
- What's he smiling about, eh?
- He's not smiling.
Calm down.
It's not a capital offense, you know?
Disperse those clowns.
What, you mean lift them, right?
I mean, they know the dead guy.
They're all in the same gang together.
Now, Luis.
How you doing, mate?
Who's that one over there?
Oh.
He's that dangerous, is he?
How does Detective Farr know him?
Hit me in the stomach.
Back off, man.
Is he one of the ones grabbing for power?
Is he?
Hey, if you hit me in the stomach, I'll pay you $50 with a smile.
- Which one is gonna make you look better?
- You're crazy.
Look, whoever killed Prince John killed your friend over there.
Right?
Who was it?
Not that lady cop.
Thanks for that.
All right, stomach, not face, all right?
- Ha, ha.
- That's really cool.
- Did you see that?
- You okay?
Oh, no, I'm fine.
Yup.
You tell your IA friend I wanna talk to that one there.
All right?
This isn't a gang war.
It's more like a gang at war with itself.
And he knows it.
He's part of it, he is.
He's even picked sides.
Two 9-6s in two days, Suarez.
Busy man.
First off, he's not a man, so try "boy."
See what I mean?
- You call this science?
- Well, it sells books, you know?
Ask him why he's so happy his own gang members are dead.
Speak.
You got nothing on me.
The lady cop killed Prince John and set him up.
Why are you lying about her?
You need her out of the way?
You need her where she's easier to get to, right?
Inside.
You know, I'm with you.
Killing cops?
Serious business.
Lawyer.
No need.
You're free to go.
Get out of here.
All right.
- You know him, do you?
- I work Gangs.
He's in a gang.
You seem exceptionally relieved to see him walking out of here a free man.
Let me guess.
He asked for a lawyer.
- You interviewed him, have you?
- A few times.
Always with Wallowski?
I got one for you.
Tell Wallowski you were on the IA payroll when you started doing her?
Why have you kept me waiting out here?
No reason.
You can go now.
I want interrogation tape on him and Wallowski and any other 9-6s.
Get out of here.
I would, but I got work to do.
Let me ask you something.
Is this about catching corrupt cops or is this about saving your friend?
Because I still have an eyewitness.
So you were two blocks away when you heard the shots.
Is that right?
Why don't you let him tell us where he was?
I was two blocks away.
So in this one, Farr is controlling the interrogation.
- He's warning Suarez.
- And the next one.
We put you there.
We got witnesses.
We know J.T. has a beef with you.
We just wanna hear your side of the story.
I need a break.
You finish this.
Wallowski walks out before the interrogation is over.
They've been in there for hours.
She needed a tinkle.
Maybe she was letting Farr blow the interrogation.
- Is there anything here you agree on?
- Yes.
There's definitely some kind of relationship between Detective Farr and Suarez.
Agreed.
Farr does sound compromised at times.
Well, if Farr's dirty, Wallowski is dirty.
What's that?
- What is that?
Guilt by association?
- May I remind you...?
Yeah, you may.
You've got an eyewitness.
I haven't forgotten.
Wallowski is arraigned in the morning.
My hands are tied.
If she goes to County, that's a death sentence.
Well, she either gives up her partner or she's on her own.
Thanks for your help.
Oh, you wanted me to lie.
I see now.
- And Mrs. Phillips, are you comfortable?
- I saw what I saw.
Let's just get on with it, shall we?
We have a quick video we'd like you to take a look at.
And when I turn that off, just give us as much detail about it as you can.
There were three people.
A couple holding hands an old man in a ball cap, and a blue car parked.
Do you know what change blindness is, Mrs. Phillips?
- Changed what?
- Change blindness.
We see what we anticipate we're gonna see, even if it changes.
The brain doesn't react to the change.
Right.
Like Charles here.
This was actually Loker just a minute ago.
So, you saw Wallowski drop Prince John off but did you look away for any time before the shooting started?
I...
I think I was brewing coffee.
And then when the shooting started, you saw the shooter, right?
Who you thought was the same person you saw with Prince John just moments earlier.
- I was about to bring you that spoon.
- How did you get me out?
Change blindness.
What you looking at, Flaco?
Lovely weather we're having.
I'm not talking about Farr.
Balmy for this time of year.
You want me to talk about Farr because you're working with IA, right?
That's how you got me out of jail.
You're working some kind of deal?
Right.
Well, that's that out of the way, then.
Where do we go now?
Straight to sex?
Look, you know he's dirty, right?
It's not exactly breaking his heart selling you out, by the way.
What if he was?
And I'm not saying that he is.
- Is what?
- Dirty.
You just said it.
There are two types of dirty.
One is who you are and one happens to you.
Oh, Farr is a victim.
Do me a favor.
Wanna know how it happens?
- How what happens?
- Corruption.
You did it again.
I'm too tired for this.
Well, humor me.
I bought the wine.
So we isolated some of her reactions during the Suarez interrogation.
First interview.
After a softball from Farr, she purses her lips, barely noticeable.
Five months later she looks away, brow furrows, much more intense reaction.
In an interrogation last year, you see disgust around her nose, around her mouth.
And finally six weeks ago her entire body shifts away from Farr, and she leaves the room.
So in terms of intensity her disgust with Farr rises from A to E in lockstep with Suarez's crimes.
As he went from joyriding to homicide.
She's known all along that Suarez and Farr had some kind of deal.
Lightman's watched all of these interviews.
How could he miss this?
Change blindness.
That's not bad for 7 bucks, eh?
You know about wine?
It's made from grapes.
What do you do when your partner busts a 14-year-old with a few grams of heroin?
You send them to juvie for a Ph.D. in Criminology or cut them a break?
I don't know.
You tell me.
You start small.
You just fudge some paperwork here and there.
Knock a banger around a bit, get a shooter out of him.
You know, that's all very interesting.
But not one mention of Detective Farr.
I'm trying to tell you, you get deep enough in, you can't get back out.
You know, two dead bodies is a world away from fudging a bit of paperwork, darling.
Really.
So get on with it, then.
Candles?
Cabinet.
Top left of the stove.
- Sexy music.
- On it.
Lube?
Just kidding.
You got a light?
I'm in the mood
Yeah.
Home invasion, 85 North Pershing.
I'm in the mood I'm in the mood
Baby, I'm in the mood for love
- Bloody hell.
Untraceable, right?
- My dad said, "Always have options."
I said night time is the right time
To be with the one you love
You know where night come Baby, God know
You're so far away
I'm in the mood
I'm in the mood
I'm in the mood for love
Yeah.
Come back to...
Baby, I'm in the mood for love
Hey!
What's that?
Oh, man, he's hit!
- He's down!
- What's going on?
Who's next?
Get him!
You got 10 seconds to get your friend out of here or we're done talking.
- All right?
- All right.
All right, don't shoot.
I'm in the mood, baby
I'm in the mood for love
Glad you met me yet?
I think it's time to lose those.
Baby, I'm in the move for love
Just saying.
How long are you gonna pretend there's nothing going on?
Oh, you wanna talk about this now?
The IA leaned on my partner to lean on me to give you up.
Now, I'm being disloyal to my partner because you're being loyal to a man who's up to his neck in it.
You're saying Dr. Foster is wrong about me?
Like she's wrong about me sometimes.
It comes from a good place.
You ever hear of off-duty booty?
Suarez is Farr's son.
I wouldn't do that if I were you, mate.
You.
It raises the blood pressure, you know?
I mean, if you want a get-out-of-jail-free pass from the IA you might wanna get it under control, mate.
All right, suit yourself.
But it does make your neck blob out a bit, you know?
Oh, really?
Wallowski.
Well, you can stick a fork in her and all because she's cooked.
You both are.
Did you know that someone shot up her house last night?
Oh, first you've heard of it.
Well, that's a good sign, I suppose.
You wanna know who it was?
It was your boy, Suarez.
And when I say "your boy," what I mean is "your son."
Nineteen years old.
Mowing his way through his own gang while you look the other way.
- You okay?
- I'm good.
And so is Suarez.
It starts simple.
Right.
You're just trying to do the right thing like any real dad would.
You can't protect him anymore.
He tried killing you last night.
Choose.
Your partner or your son.
Detective Farr.
Get me Lightman.
- Now.
- He's not in yet.
Well, he bends Farr's ear before the hearing Farr comes in and spills.
Suarez is his son.
He's been in the kid's pocket for years.
So you got your dirty cop.
Congratulations.
Farr's son killed Prince John and Stomper.
He knew they were blackmailing Farr.
And Wallowski knew it too.
She's dirty.
I mean, eight hour days with Farr for five years?
That doesn't sound like proof.
Farr takes the heat, says Wallowski knows nothing.
Lying through his teeth, and Lightman put him up to it.
Oh, this isn't about Wallowski anymore, is it?
It's about Lightman.
You can choose, Wallowski or your partner.
Because I will bring down this whole circus act if I have to.
Understand?
Do you need that in writing?
Her contempt for Farr's choices is getting harder to contain.
She knew about Suarez.
And you're sure about that?
Put her in the cube for long enough and if she's guilty, she'll betray herself.
The muscles in your cheek, relax them.
No, no.
Hands down.
If you cover your mouth, you give yourself away.
You know, if you teach me how to lie, you might never be able to trust me.
All right.
Pay attention.
Focus on what we're doing.
You're not helping me.
You're just trying to save yourself now.
That was good.
You hid the contempt.
There are four key emotions displayed here.
Disappointment, frustration, disgust, outrage.
And just like contempt any of these would expose Wallowski's role in covering up Farr's crimes.
- And you can show me what to look for?
- And what to ask.
Ask her a question she doesn't expect.
That's where you'll find unfiltered emotion, something she won't be able to hide.
You knew there was a relationship between Farr and Suarez.
They were friendly.
Part of our work with Gang Unit is to connect with these kids.
But I had no idea until yesterday they were father and son.
Oh, that's good.
Nice.
Lying comes naturally to you.
Good teacher.
Just part your lips a little for surprise, you know?
They'll be looking for that.
I don't know if I can do this.
Of course you can.
I can't lose the one cop I can squeeze on the street.
Tell me a lie.
Anything you like.
I hate you.
Now, that's brilliant.
You're ready.
You knew Detective Farr had a relationship with Marco Suarez?
We're meant to form relationships with street-level dealers.
- Did you know he was helping Suarez?
- No.
I didn't know anything about that.
But you do know that he beat Prince John to cover his relationship with Suarez to support Suarez's move to control the 9-6s.
Now that he has confessed, sure, I guess.
Is Detective Farr a good father to his children?
- Which ones?
- To his regular, family ones.
- You mean his white ones?
- Don't deflect the question, detective.
I'm sorry.
What was the question again?
Oh, yeah.
Uh...
He's incredible with his kids.
Well, don't look at me, Loker.
Give it to them straight.
I got nothing here.
zip.
Was Wallowski in on this with Farr or not?
- She's been coached.
- Or maybe she's clean.
- And you call yourself scientists?
- You call cops who disagree "cops," right?
Unless one of them is dirty.
Well, she's saying Wallowski's clean.
Aren't you, Dr. Foster?
Wait.
What are you walking away for, eh?
That's not right.
Don't do that.
- Never mind.
- I'm not going anywhere, so let's have it.
What do you see in her, Cal?
I would have done the same thing for my partner.
It's called loyalty.
That's kind of ironic from where I'm standing.
Well?
Is Wallowski lying?
Yes.
Absolutely.
Farr is not a good dad.
She's covering for him.
As for the rest of it, she's not lying.
She didn't know anything about Suarez or any of it.
Dr. Lightman?
Yeah, she's clean.
As a whistle.
My hand to God I didn't mean to
After all
Look what we've been through
Men come in different shades
That's how we're made
The little house on Ellis Drive
Is where I felt most alive
Five years of my life, and for what?
Well, you thought he was just looking after his kid, right?
So you did what you could.
And more.
Loyal to a fault.
- When I say fault, what I mean...
- She gets it, Cal.
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.
You don't like me, do you?
I didn't do what I did for you.
No, you did it for him.
Where did he go?
Wasted times
Wanna go grab a cup of coffee?
I'll take a rain check.
Violent colors so obscene
It's all I see these days
These days
Loker:
I could?
Yeah, ok.
Yeah.
2:30 is actually better for me, so, yeah, ok.
That's a personal call, is it?
Uh, can I call you back?
Thanks.
Bye.
How's the job hunt going?
It's a little tougher than you thought, is it, or...
All right, well, carry on.
Keep up the good work.
What?
All I was trying to say in there was, you know,
I want him on the street getting a life, not in there getting a latte.
Why don't you just tell him that, then?
And spoil all the fun?
Do me a favor.
Show me it.
Uh-oh.
This is Juan Ramirez, street name Prince John, of the Nine-Six clique.
Push in tighter.
That's, uh, Detective, uh...
What's his name again?
Farr.
Murderous hatred.
What happens next?
So what part of you is thinking "I told you so"?
Internal Affairs.
They've been watching Wallowski for a while.
Apparently it's not uncommon to run surveillance on gang unit cops.
You got this from I.A.?
They came to me with it, because of your relationship with Wallowski, which somehow they know about.
All right, look at her.
She's pissed off.
At her partner.
She tried to stop him.
It could be argued that she did that once the other cops arrived on the scene.
It could also be argued that you thought having a compromised cop in your pocket was a good idea and there was nothing I could do or say to warn you.
This is a message to you from Internal Affairs.
Your new friend Wallowski is under the microscope.
And they want me to stay out of it.
You want me to stay out of it.
Dr. Lightman.
What do you want?
Every cop in the city have passed their fitness test.
Police range.
Police personnel only.
What's Prince John got on you that makes you want to kill him, eh?
Have a nice day.
It's not so much fun killing cardboard, is it?
Let me guess.
You've seen the video.
Yeah.
You want to know how I got it?
I.A. gave me that tape.
Now, why would they be watching you, do you think, in your humble opinion?
What you saw on that tape is my partner subduing a suspect.
Trying to kill him, more like.
Corner kids like Prince John, they keep guns in the wheel Wells of nearby cars.
He was going for a hidden gun.
Oh, so where's the gun now, then, in a police evidence locker somewhere?
You working with I.A. Now?
If I was, you'd be in the cop shop.
Answer a simple question-- what's going on between you and your partner?
What are you hiding?
You know, you do that whole tough guy cop thing really well, but do me a favor--save it for the customers, all right?
Look, Prince John, he's a mid-level dealer with the Nine-Sixes.
All right.
So if there was a reason to arrest him yesterday, what's he doing on the street today, then?
Herman Farr is a good man, period.
What your partner did on that tape is the beginning of the end for both of you.
What do you care?
I'm just the cop that you like to squeeze on the street, in the sack, wherever.
In the sack?
That's a bit previous, isn't it?
That beating was personal.
Prince John has something on your partner, and you know exactly what it is.
Which makes you a target as well.
I can take care of myself, thank you.
Give us a go, then.
You know, you do need my help.
You just don't know how to ask for it.
Do you?
All right.
Hey.
Easy, tiger.
I'll drive.

Let's make this quick.
Check it out.
Vigilante Five-O pigs.
[Laughing]
It's Prince John, right?
Do you know what a prince is where I come from?
What did you say?
No--well, that as well.
But I wasn't talking about your sexual preferences.
A prince, where I come from, is a burden on the taxpayer.
Settle.
She's been practicing.
Beat it, snow?
What's she gonna find on you if she pats you down, eh?
Seriously.
What's she gonna plant on him, you mean?
Eight ball with your name on it in this pocket right here.
Ask your question.
Go on.
What you got on my partner?
I know he's fat.
[Laughing]
You see, I think you can do better than that, really.
Mm-Hmm.
Don't you, Wallowski?
You know the drill.
[Handcuffs jangling]
I mean, we gotta go.
[Indistinct chatter]
I'll be back.
You be all right?
Let's go.
That tune-up that Detective Farr gave you, was personal, right?
So that means either you have unfinished business or Detective Farr's on the take.
Or, you've got something he wants.
Tune-up?
Nah.
Well, I got it.
Option 2.
Detective Farr's on the take.
That's not news to you.
What-- you gonna take his word over a decorated cop?
That was no ordinary beating.
Farr wanted to kill him.
Which is why the Prince here is on the run.
What, you see me running?
My advice to you...
Dust off your sneakers...
Princess.
We done?
I need a ride home.
Well...
Protect and serve.
This is the serve part.
We found that Wallowski has a number of interesting reactions.
Pursed lips and puffed cheeks indicate resignation.
Widened eyes show fear.
Oh, yeah?
We're breaking down the videos into micro-expressions.
I'll break you down into micro-expressions in a minute.
Put your hand on your heart and tell me you think Wallowski's clean.
What, you mean clean like you?
Give us the room.
Now, look, I didn't mean that in a bad way.
I know what you meant.
Have a seat.
Now what, nurse?
You came up on I.A.'s radar the minute you and Wallowski decided to start seeing each other.
That's a business meeting, that.
I don't have an ax to grind against her, Cal,
I really don't.
[Cell phone rings]
You just don't trust my judgment where she's concerned, huh?
I don't want to see you get hurt.
Yeah.
Right.
It's a little late for that now.
For what?
I'm up to my neck in it.
Come on.
[Helicopter]
Prince John.
I dropped him off an hour ago.
[Siren]
Dr. Foster?
Can I have a word?
This isn't happening.
Did he do this?
He didn't say.
Does he know who did this?
If he did, we wouldn't be standing here talking about it.
Did you ask him?
He's a city cop 20 years.
You asked him.
Your worst nightmare-- he lied to you.
Incoming.
Detective Wallowski,
Internal Affairs.
Jenkins.
Weapon, please, Detective.
Or do you want me to arrest you out here?
Arrest her for what?
That.
On what evidence?
Eyewitness.
[Door buzzes open]
So I'm thinking, I distract the guards, and you start digging.
You got a spoon on you?
Or you could tell me the truth about Farr.
I'll get you out that way.
Look, Farr didn't kill Prince John.
You and I lifted him, an hour later he's back on the street, and that's why he's dead.
You don't believe that.
So I bit my lip.
Give me a break.
If one of those gang-bangers thinks you killed Prince John, this is the worst possible place you could be, love.
Mind if I speak with my partner now?
I'll get you that spoon.
[Door buzzes open]
What took you so long?
She's never gonna rat out her partner.
I mean, you can offer her any deal you like.
It's not going to happen.
Uh-huh.
So that's your science speaking, is it?
You need me.
Badly.
This is a department investigation, Dr. Lightman.
Do you want to look good for your career, or do you want to get this right and look even better?
If you are gaming me,
I will flush you down the toilet.
You and Wallowski.
Bollocks.
You got an innocent cop sitting in jail with a target on her back.
Wallowski's there because we have an eyewitness murder with no alibi.
You look me in the eye and you tell me you don't have skeletons.
'Cause you know if I start looking, I'll find them.
What do you want?
Detective Farr.
But...
Not here.
At my place.
My comfort zone, not yours.
And when you find dirt on that woman, Wallowski, which I know there is?
"That woman"?
Is that your science talking now?
Then you'll give her to me, too.
Woman, on tape:
I just saw a boy shot, 95th and Chalmers.
White lady cop threw him out her car, then started shooting.
Male 911 dispatcher:
And you said an officer was involved?
Woman:
Wachowski, Willinski...
[Clears throat]
Something like that.
Works the gangs up here.
I thought I took your desk away.
This is the 911 tape of the eyewitness.
She has an evasive vocal tic.
The throat clearing-- she did it when she was making statements about Detective Wallowski.
Did you come up with this all by yourself?
And, if you listen to the tape in its entirety...
Woman:
It was definitely her.
I recognized...
She gives unnecessary details.
Not answering questions directly.
She's lying.
Maybe she's just old.
Look, you keep doing that.
And it just gets funnier and funnier.
Where'd you get the 911 tape from, hey?
You're not the only one with police contacts.
What, Loker?
Afraid so.
Next time, however, will you run it by me first?
That throat clearing-- it's phlegm--she's a smoker.
[Video game sound effects playing]
African coffee.
Best on the planet.
[Video game sound effects]
Is that your son in there, Mrs. Phillips?
Oh, lord, no.
Grandson.
Louis.
He lives with me.
How do you take it?
A splash of milk, 2 sugars.
That's me.
Where in Africa?
Kenya.
Mrs. Phillips:
I know a guy knows a guy...
[Man shouts on video game]
Second man:
Watch that chopper!
You trying to make your grandma deaf?
Leave her out of this.
[Weapons fire, man shouts, dog barks]
[Turns down volume]
Leave her out of what?
You a cop.
I can smell.
How old are you, then?
Nice ink, that.
That's the Nine-Sixes, is it?
You know, the proud, the few.
However it goes.
Comedian cop.
You just play your game.
You don't mind me, all right?
How about over here?
And whoever killed Prince John,
I wouldn't breathe a word about that if I were you.
I don't know nothin' about that.
Well, that's smart.
You see, you keep your mouth shut, you pick your side in this war carefully, 'cause you never know, right?
Next time it could be you, couldn't it?
Beat it, snow.
Damn.
[Beeping]
I'd get that if I were you.
You never leave home without it, right?
Oh, yeah, 'cause I'm that stupid.
Keep it.
I'm straight.
Snow.
I'm beginning to like that.
It's growing on me.
Very creative, that.
I'm going over to Ronnie's house, grandma.
Be home for dinner.
It's your favorite.
Ronnie's house, my ass.
Here.
Merry Christmas.
It's a firing pin.
Just so long as he comes home is all.
Yeah.
What was I saying?
The shooting.
Prince John.
Yes.
I'm 110% certain it was the Wallowski girl who shot him.
I might be old, but I'm not blind.
[Tires screeching]
[Loud engine]
You know, there's many different kinds of blindness.
Blind is blind.
Right, yeah.
Well, thanks for your time, Mrs. Phillips.
That's it?
What about your coffee?
Rain check.
[Helicopter]
[Indistinct police radio]
Hi, mate.
Louis, I thought you was on your way to Ronnie's.
You lost?
Oh, look at you.
Lovely.
Matching ink.
You guys must really, really like each other.
Or something.
Not that there's anything wrong with that.
[Clicks tongue]
Farr:
It's ok.
Good evening, all.
Another day in D.C., Professor.
Cal:
Whew.
Blimey.
Well, at least your partner's got an alibi this time.
You know, her being in jail and that.
Who was he?
His street name's Stomper.
Local pharmaceutical rep for the Nine-Sixes.
Who's that one?
Hey?
What's he smiling about, eh?
He's not smiling.
Come on, calm down.
It's not a capital offense, you know.
Disperse those clowns.
What, you mean lift 'em, right?
I mean, they know the dead guy.
They're all in the same gang together.
Now, listen.
How you doin', mate?
Who's that one over there?
Oh.
He's that dangerous, is he?
How does Detective Farr know him?
Hit me in the stomach.
Back off, man.
Is he one of the ones grabbing for power?
Is he?
You hit me in the stomach, I'll pay you $50, with a smile.
Which one's gonna make you look better?
You're crazy.
Look, whoever killed Prince John killed your friend over there.
Right?
Who was it?
Not that lady cop.
Thanks for that.
All right, stomach, not face, all right?
[Laughing] Ohh!
That's cold.
[Laughing continues]
Did you see that?
You ok?
Oh, no, I'm fine.
Cal.
You tell your I.A. Friend
I want to talk to that one there.
All right?
This isn't a gang war.
It's more like a gang at war with itself.
And he knows it.
He's part of it, he is.
He's even picked sides.
Two Nine-Sixes in two days, Suarez.
Busy man.
First off, he's not a man, so try "boy."
See what I mean?
You Call this science?
Well, it sells books, you know?
Ask him why he's so happy his own gang members are dead.
Speak.
You got nothin' on me.
The lady cop killed Prince John and set him up.
Why are you lying about her?
Do you need her out of the way?
You need her where she's easier to get to.
Right?
Inside.
I'm with you.
Killing cops is serious business.
Lawyer.
No need.
You're free to go.
Get out of here.
Hello.
You know him, do you?
I work gangs.
He's in a gang.
You seem exceptionally relieved to see him walking out of here a free man.
Let me guess.
He asked for a lawyer.
You've interviewed him, have you?
A few times, yeah.
Always with Wallowski?
I got one for you.
Did you tell Wallowski you were on the I.A. payroll when you started doing her?
And why have you kept me waiting out here?
No reason.
You can go now.
I want interrogation tape on him and Wallowski and any other Nine-Sixes.
Get out of here.
I would, but I got work to do.
Let me ask you something.
Is this about catching corrupt cops for you, or is this about saving your friend?
Because I still have an eyewitness.
So you were 2 blocks away when you heard the shots.
Is that right?
Why don't you let him tell us where he was.
I was 2 blocks away.
So in this one,
Farr is controlling the interrogation.
He's warning Suarez.
And then the next one.
We put you there.
We got witnesses.
We know J.T. has a beef with you.
We just want to hear your side of the story, that's all.
I need a break.
You finish this.
Wallowski walks out before the interrogation is over.
Well, they've been in there for 3 hours.
I mean, maybe she just needed a tinkle.
Or maybe she was letting Farr blow the interrogation.
Is there anything here you agree on?
Yes.
There's definitely some kind of relationship between Detective Farr and Suarez.
Agreed.
Farr does sound compromised at times.
Well, if Farr's dirty, Wallowski's dirty.
What's that?
What is that, guilt by association?
You may.
May I remind you-- you've got an eyewitness.
I haven't forgotten.
Wallowski's arraigned in the morning.
My hands are tied.
She goes to county, that's a death sentence.
Well, she either gives up her partner or she's on her own.
Thanks for your help.
Oh, you wanted me to lie.
I see now.
Mrs. Phillips, are you comfortable?
I saw what I saw.
[Clears throat] Let's just get on with it, shall we?
Ok, we just have a quick video we'd like you to take a look at.
And when I turn it off, just give us as much detail about it as you can.
There were 3 people.
A couple holding hands, an old man in a ball cap, and a blue car parked.
Do you know what change blindness is, Mrs. Phillips?
Changed what?
Change blindness.
We see what we anticipate we're going to see, even if it changes.
The brain doesn't react to the change.
Right.
Like Charles here.
This was actually Loker just a minute ago.
So, you saw Wallowski drop Prince John off, but did you look away for any time before the shooting started?
I...
I think I was brewing coffee.
And then when the shooting started, you looked out the window, you saw the shooter, right?
Who you thought was the same person you saw with Prince John just moments earlier.
I was about to bring you that spoon.
How did you get me out?
Change blindness.
What you lookin' at, Flaco?
Lovely weather we're having.
I'm not talking about Farr.
Balmy for this time of year.
You want me to talk about Farr 'cause you're working with I.A., right?
That's how you got me out of jail, you're working some kind of deal?
Right.
Well, that's that out of the way, then.
Where do we go now?
Straight to sex?
Look, you know he's dirty, right?
It's not exactly breaking his heart selling you out, by the way.
What if he was?
And I'm not saying that he is.
Is what?
Dirty.
You just said it.
There are two types of dirty.
One is who you are and one happens to you.
Oh, Farr's a victim.
Do me a favor.
Want to know how it happens?
How what happens?
Corruption.
You did it again.
I'm too tired for this.
Well, humor me.
I brought the wine.
So we isolated some of her reactions during the Suarez interrogation.
First interview-- after a softball from Farr, she purses her lips, barely noticeable.
5 months later, she looks away, brow furrows, much more intense reaction.
In an interrogation last year, you see disgust around her nose, on her mouth.
And finally 6 weeks ago, her entire body shifts away from Farr and she leaves the room.
So, in terms of intensity, her disgust with Farr rises from an "a" to an "e"
in lock-step with Suarez's crimes.
As he went from joyriding to homicide.
She's known all along that Suarez and Farr had some kind of deal.
Lightman's watched all of these interviews.
How could he miss this?
Change blindness.
That's not bad for 7 bucks, eh?
You know about wine?
It's made from grapes.
What do you do when your partner busts a 14-year-old with a few grams of heroin?
You send them to juvie for a PhD.
In criminology or cut 'em a break?
I don't know.
You tell me.
You start small.
You just fudge some paperwork here and there.
Knock a banger around a bit, get a shooter out of him.
You know, that's all very interesting.
But not one mention of Detective Farr.
I'm trying to tell you, you get deep enough in, you can't get back out.
You know, two dead bodies is a world away from fudging a bit of paperwork, darlin', really.
So...
Get on with it, then.

How long you gonna pretend there's nothing going on between Suarez and Farr?
You want to talk about this now?
The I.A. leaned on my partner to lean on me to give you up.
Now, I'm being disloyal to my partner because you're being loyal to a man who's up to his neck in it.
You're saying Dr. Foster's wrong about me?
Like she's wrong about me sometimes.
It comes from a good place.
You ever hear of off-duty Booty?
Suarez is Farr's son.
I wouldn't do that if I were you, mate.
You.
Raises the blood pressure, you know?
I me, if you want a "get out of jail free" pass from the I.A., you might want to get it under control, mate.
All right, suit yourself.
But it does make your neck blob out a bit, you know?
Oh, yeah.
Wallowski?
Well, you can stick a fork in her and all, 'cause she's cooked.
You both are.
Did you know that someone shot up her house last night?
Oh, first you've heard of it.
Well, that's a good sign, I suppose.
You want to know who it was?
It was your boy Suarez.
And when I say your boy, what I mean is, your son.
19 years old.
Mowing his way through his own gang while you look the other way.
You ok?
I'm good.
And so is Suarez.
It starts simple.
Right?
You're just trying to do the right thing, like any real dad would.
You can't protect him anymore.
He tried killing you last night.
Choose.
Your partner...
Or your son.
[Door opens]
Detective Farr.
Get me Lightman.
Now.
He's not in yet.
Well, he bends Farr's ear before the hearing,
Farr comes in and spills.
Suarez is his son.
He's been in the kid's pocket for years.
So you got your dirty cop.
Congratulations.
Farr's son killed Prince John and Stomper because he knew they were blackmailing Farr.
And Wallowski knew it, too.
She's dirty.
I mean, 8-hour days with Farr for 5 years?
It doesn't sound like proof.
Farr takes the heat, says Wallowski knows nothing.
Lying through his teeth, and Lightman put him up to it.
Oh, this isn't about Wallowski anymore, is it?
It's about Lightman.
You can choose--
Wallowski or your partner.
Because I will bring down this whole circus act if I have to.
Understand?
Do you need that in writing?
Her contempt for Farr's choices is getting harder to contain.
She knew about Suarez.
And you're sure about that?
Put her in the cube for long enough, and if she's guilty, she'll betray herself.
The muscles in your cheek, relax them.
No, no.
Hands down.
You cover your mouth, you give yourself away.
You know, if you teach me how to lie, you might never be able to trust me.
All right, pay attention.
Focus on what we're doing.
You're not helping me.
You're just trying to save yourself now.
That was good.
You hid the contempt.
There are 4 key emotions displayed here.
Disappointment, frustration, disgust, outrage.
And just like contempt, any of these would expose Wallowski's role in covering up Farr's crimes.
And you can show me what to look for?
And what to ask.
Ask her a question she doesn't expect.
That's where you'll find unfiltered emotion, something she won't be able to hide.
You knew there was a relationship between Farr and Suarez.
They were friendly.
Part of our work with gang unit is to connect with these kids.
But I had no idea until yesterday they were father and son.
Oh, that's good.
Nice.
Lying comes naturally to you.
Good teacher.
Just part your lips a little for surprise, you know.
They'll be looking for that.
I don't know if I can do this.
Of course you can.
I can't lose the one cop I can squeeze, on the street.
Tell me a lie.
Anything you like.
I hate you.
Now, that's brilliant.
You're ready.
You knew Detective Farr had a relationship with Marco Suarez?
We're meant to form relationships with street-level dealers.
But did you know he was helping Suarez commit crimes?
No.
I didn't know anything about that.
But you do know that he beat Prince John to cover his relationship with Suarez, to support Suarez's move to control the Nine-Sixes.
Now that he's confessed, sure, I guess.
Was Detective Farr a good father to his children?
Which ones?
To his regular family ones.
You mean his white ones.
Don't deflect the question, Detective.
I'm sorry, what was the question again?
Oh, yeah.
Uh, he's incredible with his kids.
Well, don't look at me, Loker.
Give it to them straight.
I get nothing here.
Zip.
Was Wallowski in on this with Farr or not?
She's been coached.
Or maybe she's clean.
And you Call yourself scientists?
You call cops who disagree cops?
Unless one of them's dirty.
Well, she's saying Wallowski's clean.
Aren't you, Dr. Foster?
Wait!
What are you walking away for, hey?
That's not right.
Don't do that.
Never mind.
I'm not going anywhere, Gill, so let's have it.
What do you see in her, Cal?
I'd have done the same thing for my partner.
It's called loyalty.
That's kind of ironic from where I'm standing.
Well?
Is Wallowski lying?
Yes.
Absolutely.
Farr is not a good dad.
She's covering for him.
As for the rest of it, she's not lying.
She didn't know anything about Suarez or any of it.
D--Dr.
Lightman?
Yeah, she's clean.
As a whistle.

How's the job hunt going?
It's a little tougher than you thought, is it, or...
All right, well, carry on.
Keep up the good work.
What?
All I was trying to say in there was, you know,
I want him on the street getting a life, not in there getting a latte.
Why don't you just tell him that, then?
And spoil all the fun?
Do me a favor.
Show me it.
Uh-oh.
This is Juan Ramirez, street name Prince John, of the Nine-Six clique.
Push in tighter.
That's, uh, Detective, uh...
What's his name again?
Farr.
Murderous hatred.
What happens next?
So what part of you is thinking "I told you so"?
Internal Affairs.
They've been watching Wallowski for a while.
Apparently it's not uncommon to run surveillance on gang unit cops.
You got this from I.A.?
They came to me with it, because of your relationship with Wallowski, which somehow they know about.
All right, look at her.
She's pissed off.
At her partner.
She tried to stop him.
It could be argued that she did that once the other cops arrived on the scene.
It could also be argued that you thought having a compromised cop in your pocket was a good idea and there was nothing I could do or say to warn you.
This is a message to you from Internal Affairs.
Your new friend Wallowski is under the microscope.
And they want me to stay out of it.
You want me to stay out of it.
Dr. Lightman.
What do you want?
Every cop in the city have passed their fitness test.
Police range.
Police personnel only.
What's Prince John got on you that makes you want to kill him, eh?
Have a nice day.
It's not so much fun killing cardboard, is it?
Let me guess.
You've seen the video.
Yeah.
You want to know how I got it?
I.A. gave me that tape.
Now, why would they be watching you, do you think, in your humble opinion?
What you saw on that tape is my partner subduing a suspect.
Trying to kill him, more like.
Corner kids like Prince John, they keep guns in the wheel Wells of nearby cars.
He was going for a hidden gun.
Oh, so where's the gun now, then, in a police evidence locker somewhere?
You working with I.A. Now?
If I was, you'd be in the cop shop.
Answer a simple question-- what's going on between you and your partner?
What are you hiding?
You know, you do that whole tough guy cop thing really well, but do me a favor--save it for the customers, all right?
Look, Prince John, he's a mid-level dealer with the Nine-Sixes.
All right.
So if there was a reason to arrest him yesterday, what's he doing on the street today, then?
Herman Farr is a good man, period.
What your partner did on that tape is the beginning of the end for both of you.
What do you care?
I'm just the cop that you like to squeeze on the street, in the sack, wherever.
In the sack?
That's a bit previous, isn't it?
That beating was personal.
Prince John has something on your partner, and you know exactly what it is.
Which makes you a target as well.
I can take care of myself, thank you.
Give us a go, then.
You know, you do need my help.
You just don't know how to ask for it.
Do you?
All right.
Hey.
Easy, tiger.
I'll drive.

A prince, where I come from, is a burden on the taxpayer.

She's been practicing.

That's not news to you.
What-- you gonna take his word over a decorated cop?
That was no ordinary beating.
Farr wanted to kill him.
Which is why the Prince here is on the run.
What, you see me running?
My advice to you...
Dust off your sneakers...
Princess.
We done?
I need a ride home.
Well...
Protect and serve.
This is the serve part.
We found that Wallowski has a number of interesting reactions.
Pursed lips and puffed cheeks indicate resignation.
Widened eyes show fear.
Oh, yeah?
We're breaking down the videos into micro-expressions.
I'll break you down into micro-expressions in a minute.
Put your hand on your heart and tell me you think Wallowski's clean.
What, you mean clean like you?
Give us the room.
Now, look, I didn't mean that in a bad way.
I know what you meant.
Have a seat.
Now what, nurse?
You came up on I.A.'s radar the minute you and Wallowski decided to start seeing each other.
That's a business meeting, that.
I don't have an ax to grind against her, Cal,
I really don't.
You just don't trust my judgment where she's concerned, huh?
I don't want to see you get hurt.
Yeah.
Right.
It's a little late for that now.
For what?
I'm up to my neck in it.
Come on.
Prince John.
I dropped him off an hour ago.
Dr. Foster?
Can I have a word?
This isn't happening.
Did he do this?
He didn't say.
Does he know who did this?
If he did, we wouldn't be standing here talking about it.
Did you ask him?
He's a city cop 20 years.
You asked him.
Your worst nightmare-- he lied to you.
Incoming.
Detective Wallowski,
Internal Affairs.
Jenkins.
Weapon, please, Detective.
Or do you want me to arrest you out here?
Arrest her for what?
That.
On what evidence?
Eyewitness.
So I'm thinking, I distract the guards, and you start digging.
You got a spoon on you?
Or you could tell me the truth about Farr.
I'll get you out that way.
Look, Farr didn't kill Prince John.
You and I lifted him, an hour later he's back on the street, and that's why he's dead.
You don't believe that.
So I bit my lip.
Give me a break.
If one of those gang-bangers thinks you killed Prince John, this is the worst possible place you could be, love.
Mind if I speak with my partner now?
I'll get you that spoon.
What took you so long?
She's never gonna rat out her partner.
I mean, you can offer her any deal you like.
It's not going to happen.
Uh-huh.
So that's your science speaking, is it?
You need me.
Badly.
This is a department investigation, Dr. Lightman.
Do you want to look good for your career, or do you want to get this right and look even better?
If you are gaming me,
I will flush you down the toilet.
You and Wallowski.
Bollocks.
You got an innocent cop sitting in jail with a target on her back.
Wallowski's there because we have an eyewitness murder with no alibi.
You look me in the eye and you tell me you don't have skeletons.
'Cause you know if I start looking, I'll find them.
What do you want?
Detective Farr.
But...
Not here.
At my place.
My comfort zone, not yours.
And when you find dirt on that woman, Wallowski, which I know there is?
"That woman"?
Is that your science talking now?
Then you'll give her to me, too.
Woman, on tape:
I just saw a boy shot, 95th and Chalmers.
White lady cop threw him out her car, then started shooting.
Male 911 dispatcher:
And you said an officer was involved?
Wachowski, Willinski...
Something like that.
Works the gangs up here.
I thought I took your desk away.
This is the 911 tape of the eyewitness.
She has an evasive vocal tic.
The throat clearing-- she did it when she was making statements about Detective Wallowski.
Did you come up with this all by yourself?
And, if you listen to the tape in its entirety...
It was definitely her.
I recognized...
She gives unnecessary details.
Not answering questions directly.
She's lying.
Maybe she's just old.
Look, you keep doing that.
And it just gets funnier and funnier.
Where'd you get the 911 tape from, hey?
You're not the only one with police contacts.
What, Loker?
Afraid so.
Next time, however, will you run it by me first?
That throat clearing-- it's phlegm--she's a smoker.
African coffee.
Best on the planet.
Is that your son in there, Mrs. Phillips?
Oh, lord, no.
Grandson.
Louis.
He lives with me.
How do you take it?
A splash of milk, 2 sugars.
That's me.
Where in Africa?
Kenya.
Mrs. Phillips:
I know a guy knows a guy...
Second man:
Watch that chopper!
You trying to make your grandma deaf?
Leave her out of this.
Leave her out of what?
You a cop.
I can smell.
How old are you, then?
Nice ink, that.
That's the Nine-Sixes, is it?
You know, the proud, the few.
However it goes.
Comedian cop.
You just play your game.
You don't mind me, all right?
How about over here?
And whoever killed Prince John,
I wouldn't breathe a word about that if I were you.
I don't know nothin' about that.
Well, that's smart.
You see, you keep your mouth shut, you pick your side in this war carefully, 'cause you never know, right?
Next time it could be you, couldn't it?
Beat it, snow.
Damn.
I'd get that if I were you.
You never leave home without it, right?
Oh, yeah, 'cause I'm that stupid.
Keep it.
I'm straight.
Snow.
I'm beginning to like that.
It's growing on me.
Very creative, that.
I'm going over to Ronnie's house, grandma.
Be home for dinner.
It's your favorite.
Ronnie's house, my ass.
Here.
Merry Christmas.
It's a firing pin.
Just so long as he comes home is all.
Yeah.
What was I saying?
The shooting.
Prince John.
Yes.
I'm 110% certain it was the Wallowski girl who shot him.
I might be old, but I'm not blind.
You know, there's many different kinds of blindness.
Blind is blind.
Right, yeah.
Well, thanks for your time, Mrs. Phillips.
That's it?
What about your coffee?
Rain check.
Hi, mate.
Louis, I thought you was on your way to Ronnie's.
You lost?
Oh, look at you.
Lovely.
Matching ink.
You guys must really, really like each other.
Or something.
Not that there's anything wrong with that.
It's ok.
Good evening, all.
Another day in D.C., Professor.
Whew.
Blimey.
Well, at least your partner's got an alibi this time.
You know, her being in jail and that.
Who was he?
His street name's Stomper.
Local pharmaceutical rep for the Nine-Sixes.
Who's that one?
Hey?
What's he smiling about, eh?
He's not smiling.
Come on, calm down.
It's not a capital offense, you know.
Disperse those clowns.
What, you mean lift 'em, right?
I mean, they know the dead guy.
They're all in the same gang together.
Now, listen.
How you doin', mate?
Who's that one over there?
Oh.
He's that dangerous, is he?
How does Detective Farr know him?
Hit me in the stomach.
Back off, man.
Is he one of the ones grabbing for power?
Is he?
You hit me in the stomach, I'll pay you $50, with a smile.
Which one's gonna make you look better?
You're crazy.
Look, whoever killed Prince John killed your friend over there.
Right?
Who was it?
Not that lady cop.
Thanks for that.
All right, stomach, not face, all right?
Ohh!
That's cold.
Did you see that?
You ok?
Oh, no, I'm fine.
Cal.
You tell your I.A. Friend
I want to talk to that one there.
All right?
This isn't a gang war.
It's more like a gang at war with itself.
And he knows it.
He's part of it, he is.
He's even picked sides.
Two Nine-Sixes in two days, Suarez.
Busy man.
First off, he's not a man, so try "boy."
See what I mean?
You Call this science?
Well, it sells books, you know?
Ask him why he's so happy his own gang members are dead.
Speak.
You got nothin' on me.
The lady cop killed Prince John and set him up.
Why are you lying about her?
Do you need her out of the way?
You need her where she's easier to get to.
Right?
Inside.
I'm with you.
Killing cops is serious business.
Lawyer.
No need.
You're free to go.
Get out of here.
Hello.
You know him, do you?
I work gangs.
He's in a gang.
You seem exceptionally relieved to see him walking out of here a free man.
Let me guess.
He asked for a lawyer.
You've interviewed him, have you?
A few times, yeah.
Always with Wallowski?
I got one for you.
Did you tell Wallowski you were on the I.A. payroll when you started doing her?
And why have you kept me waiting out here?
No reason.
You can go now.
I want interrogation tape on him and Wallowski and any other Nine-Sixes.
Get out of here.
I would, but I got work to do.
Let me ask you something.
Is this about catching corrupt cops for you, or is this about saving your friend?
Because I still have an eyewitness.
So you were 2 blocks away when you heard the shots.
Is that right?
Why don't you let him tell us where he was.
I was 2 blocks away.
So in this one,
Farr is controlling the interrogation.
He's warning Suarez.
And then the next one.
We put you there.
We got witnesses.
We know J.T. has a beef with you.
We just want to hear your side of the story, that's all.
I need a break.
You finish this.
Wallowski walks out before the interrogation is over.
Well, they've been in there for 3 hours.
I mean, maybe she just needed a tinkle.
Or maybe she was letting Farr blow the interrogation.
Is there anything here you agree on?
Yes.
There's definitely some kind of relationship between Detective Farr and Suarez.
Agreed.
Farr does sound compromised at times.
Well, if Farr's dirty, Wallowski's dirty.
What's that?
What is that, guilt by association?
You may.
May I remind you-- you've got an eyewitness.
I haven't forgotten.
Wallowski's arraigned in the morning.
My hands are tied.
She goes to county, that's a death sentence.
Well, she either gives up her partner or she's on her own.
Thanks for your help.
Oh, you wanted me to lie.
I see now.
Mrs. Phillips, are you comfortable?
I saw what I saw.
Let's just get on with it, shall we?
Ok, we just have a quick video we'd like you to take a look at.
And when I turn it off, just give us as much detail about it as you can.
There were 3 people.
A couple holding hands, an old man in a ball cap, and a blue car parked.
Do you know what change blindness is, Mrs. Phillips?
Changed what?
Change blindness.
We see what we anticipate we're going to see, even if it changes.
The brain doesn't react to the change.
Right.
Like Charles here.
This was actually Loker just a minute ago.
So, you saw Wallowski drop Prince John off, but did you look away for any time before the shooting started?
I...
I think I was brewing coffee.
And then when the shooting started, you looked out the window, you saw the shooter, right?
Who you thought was the same person you saw with Prince John just moments earlier.
I was about to bring you that spoon.
How did you get me out?
Change blindness.
What you lookin' at, Flaco?
Lovely weather we're having.
I'm not talking about Farr.
Balmy for this time of year.
You want me to talk about Farr 'cause you're working with I.A., right?
That's how you got me out of jail, you're working some kind of deal?
Right.
Well, that's that out of the way, then.
Where do we go now?
Straight to sex?
Look, you know he's dirty, right?
It's not exactly breaking his heart selling you out, by the way.
What if he was?
And I'm not saying that he is.
Is what?
Dirty.
You just said it.
There are two types of dirty.
One is who you are and one happens to you.
Oh, Farr's a victim.
Do me a favor.
Want to know how it happens?
How what happens?
Corruption.
You did it again.
I'm too tired for this.
Well, humor me.
I brought the wine.
So we isolated some of her reactions during the Suarez interrogation.
First interview-- after a softball from Farr, she purses her lips, barely noticeable.
5 months later, she looks away, brow furrows, much more intense reaction.
In an interrogation last year, you see disgust around her nose, on her mouth.
And finally 6 weeks ago, her entire body shifts away from Farr and she leaves the room.
So, in terms of intensity, her disgust with Farr rises from an "a" to an "e"
in lock-step with Suarez's crimes.
As he went from joyriding to homicide.
She's known all along that Suarez and Farr had some kind of deal.
Lightman's watched all of these interviews.
How could he miss this?
Change blindness.
That's not bad for 7 bucks, eh?
You know about wine?
It's made from grapes.
What do you do when your partner busts a 14-year-old with a few grams of heroin?
You send them to juvie for a PhD.
In criminology or cut 'em a break?
I don't know.
You tell me.
You start small.
You just fudge some paperwork here and there.
Knock a banger around a bit, get a shooter out of him.
You know, that's all very interesting.
But not one mention of Detective Farr.
I'm trying to tell you, you get deep enough in, you can't get back out.
You know, two dead bodies is a world away from fudging a bit of paperwork, darlin', really.
So...
Get on with it, then.
Candles?
Cabinet.

How long you gonna pretend there's nothing going on between Suarez and Farr?
You want to talk about this now?
The I.A. leaned on my partner to lean on me to give you up.
Now, I'm being disloyal to my partner because you're being loyal to a man who's up to his neck in it.
You're saying Dr. Foster's wrong about me?
Like she's wrong about me sometimes.
It comes from a good place.
You ever hear of off-duty Booty?
Suarez is Farr's son.
I wouldn't do that if I were you, mate.
You.
Raises the blood pressure, you know?
I me, if you want a "get out of jail free" pass from the I.A., you might want to get it under control, mate.
All right, suit yourself.
But it does make your neck blob out a bit, you know?
Oh, yeah.
Wallowski?
Well, you can stick a fork in her and all, 'cause she's cooked.
You both are.
Did you know that someone shot up her house last night?
Oh, first you've heard of it.
Well, that's a good sign, I suppose.
You want to know who it was?
It was your boy Suarez.
And when I say your boy, what I mean is, your son.
19 years old.
Mowing his way through his own gang while you look the other way.
You ok?
I'm good.
And so is Suarez.
It starts simple.
Right?
You're just trying to do the right thing, like any real dad would.
You can't protect him anymore.
He tried killing you last night.
Choose.
Your partner...
Or your son.
Detective Farr.
Get me Lightman.
Now.
He's not in yet.
Well, he bends Farr's ear before the hearing,
Farr comes in and spills.
Suarez is his son.
He's been in the kid's pocket for years.
So you got your dirty cop.
Congratulations.
Farr's son killed Prince John and Stomper because he knew they were blackmailing Farr.
And Wallowski knew it, too.
She's dirty.
I mean, 8-hour days with Farr for 5 years?
It doesn't sound like proof.
Farr takes the heat, says Wallowski knows nothing.
Lying through his teeth, and Lightman put him up to it.
Oh, this isn't about Wallowski anymore, is it?
It's about Lightman.
You can choose--
Wallowski or your partner.
Because I will bring down this whole circus act if I have to.
Understand?
Do you need that in writing?
Her contempt for Farr's choices is getting harder to contain.
She knew about Suarez.
And you're sure about that?
Put her in the cube for long enough, and if she's guilty, she'll betray herself.
The muscles in your cheek, relax them.
No, no.
Hands down.
You cover your mouth, you give yourself away.
You know, if you teach me how to lie, you might never be able to trust me.
All right, pay attention.
Focus on what we're doing.
You're not helping me.
You're just trying to save yourself now.
That was good.
You hid the contempt.
There are 4 key emotions displayed here.
Disappointment, frustration, disgust, outrage.
And just like contempt, any of these would expose Wallowski's role in covering up Farr's crimes.
And you can show me what to look for?
And what to ask.
Ask her a question she doesn't expect.
That's where you'll find unfiltered emotion, something she won't be able to hide.
You knew there was a relationship between Farr and Suarez.
They were friendly.
Part of our work with gang unit is to connect with these kids.
But I had no idea until yesterday they were father and son.
Oh, that's good.
Nice.
Lying comes naturally to you.
Good teacher.
Just part your lips a little for surprise, you know.
They'll be looking for that.
I don't know if I can do this.
Of course you can.
I can't lose the one cop I can squeeze, on the street.
Tell me a lie.
Anything you like.
I hate you.
Now, that's brilliant.
You're ready.
You knew Detective Farr had a relationship with Marco Suarez?
We're meant to form relationships with street-level dealers.
But did you know he was helping Suarez commit crimes?
No.
I didn't know anything about that.
But you do know that he beat Prince John to cover his relationship with Suarez, to support Suarez's move to control the Nine-Sixes.
Now that he's confessed, sure, I guess.
Was Detective Farr a good father to his children?
Which ones?
To his regular family ones.
You mean his white ones.
Don't deflect the question, Detective.
I'm sorry, what was the question again?
Oh, yeah.
Uh, he's incredible with his kids.
Well, don't look at me, Loker.
Give it to them straight.
I get nothing here.
Zip.
Was Wallowski in on this with Farr or not?
She's been coached.
Or maybe she's clean.
And you Call yourself scientists?
You call cops who disagree cops?
Unless one of them's dirty.
Well, she's saying Wallowski's clean.
Aren't you, Dr. Foster?
Wait!
What are you walking away for, hey?
That's not right.
Don't do that.
Never mind.
I'm not going anywhere, Gill, so let's have it.
What do you see in her, Cal?
I'd have done the same thing for my partner.
It's called loyalty.
That's kind of ironic from where I'm standing.
Well?
Is Wallowski lying?
Yes.
Absolutely.
Farr is not a good dad.
She's covering for him.
As for the rest of it, she's not lying.
She didn't know anything about Suarez or any of it.
D--Dr.
Lightman?
Yeah, she's clean.

How's the job hunt going?
It's a little tougher than you thought, is it, or...
All right, well, carry on.
Keep up the good work.
What?
All I was trying to say in there was, you know,
I want him on the street getting a life, not in there getting a latte.
Why don't you just tell him that, then?
And spoil all the fun?
Do me a favor.
Show me it.
Uh-oh.
This is Juan Ramirez, street name Prince John, of the Nine-Six clique.
Push in tighter.
That's, uh, Detective, uh...
What's his name again?
Farr.
Murderous hatred.
What happens next?
So what part of you is thinking "I told you so"?
Internal Affairs.
They've been watching Wallowski for a while.
Apparently it's not uncommon to run surveillance on gang unit cops.
You got this from I.A.?
They came to me with it, because of your relationship with Wallowski, which somehow they know about.
All right, look at her.
She's pissed off.
At her partner.
She tried to stop him.
It could be argued that she did that once the other cops arrived on the scene.
It could also be argued that you thought having a compromised cop in your pocket was a good idea and there was nothing I could do or say to warn you.
This is a message to you from Internal Affairs.
Your new friend Wallowski is under the microscope.
And they want me to stay out of it.
You want me to stay out of it.
Dr. Lightman.
What do you want?
Every cop in the city have passed their fitness test.
Police range.
Police personnel only.
What's Prince John got on you that makes you want to kill him, eh?
Have a nice day.
It's not so much fun killing cardboard, is it?
Let me guess.
You've seen the video.
Yeah.
You want to know how I got it?
I.A. gave me that tape.
Now, why would they be watching you, do you think, in your humble opinion?
What you saw on that tape is my partner subduing a suspect.
Trying to kill him, more like.
Corner kids like Prince John, they keep guns in the wheel Wells of nearby cars.
He was going for a hidden gun.
Oh, so where's the gun now, then, in a police evidence locker somewhere?
You working with I.A. Now?
If I was, you'd be in the cop shop.
Answer a simple question-- what's going on between you and your partner?
What are you hiding?
You know, you do that whole tough guy cop thing really well, but do me a favor--save it for the customers, all right?
Look, Prince John, he's a mid-level dealer with the Nine-Sixes.
All right.
So if there was a reason to arrest him yesterday, what's he doing on the street today, then?
Herman Farr is a good man, period.
What your partner did on that tape is the beginning of the end for both of you.
What do you care?
I'm just the cop that you like to squeeze on the street, in the sack, wherever.
In the sack?
That's a bit previous, isn't it?
That beating was personal.
Prince John has something on your partner, and you know exactly what it is.
Which makes you a target as well.
I can take care of myself, thank you.
Give us a go, then.
You know, you do need my help.
You just don't know how to ask for it.
Do you?
All right.
Hey.
Easy, tiger.
I'll drive.

It's Prince John, right?
Do you know what a prince is where I come from?
What did you say?
No--well, that as well.
But I wasn't talking about your sexual preferences.
A prince, where I come from, is a burden on the taxpayer.
Settle.
She's been practicing.
Beat it, snow?
What's she gonna find on you if she pats you down, eh?
Seriously.
What's she gonna plant on him, you mean?
Eight ball with your name on it in this pocket right here.
Ask your question.
Go on.
What you got on my partner?
I know he's fat.
You see, I think you can do better than that, really.
Mm-Hmm.
Don't you, Wallowski?
You know the drill.
I mean, we gotta go.
I'll be back.
You be all right?
Let's go.
That tune-up that Detective Farr gave you, was personal, right?
So that means either you have unfinished business or Detective Farr's on the take.
Or, you've got something he wants.
Tune-up?
Nah.
Well, I got it.
Option 2.
Detective Farr's on the take.
That's not news to you.
What-- you gonna take his word over a decorated cop?
That was no ordinary beating.
Farr wanted to kill him.
Which is why the Prince here is on the run.
What, you see me running?
My advice to you...
Dust off your sneakers...
Princess.
We done?
I need a ride home.
Well...
Protect and serve.
This is the serve part.
We found that Wallowski has a number of interesting reactions.
Pursed lips and puffed cheeks indicate resignation.
Widened eyes show fear.
Oh, yeah?
We're breaking down the videos into micro-expressions.
I'll break you down into micro-expressions in a minute.
Put your hand on your heart and tell me you think Wallowski's clean.
What, you mean clean like you?
Give us the room.
Now, look, I didn't mean that in a bad way.
I know what you meant.
Have a seat.
Now what, nurse?
You came up on I.A.'s radar the minute you and Wallowski decided to start seeing each other.
That's a business meeting, that.
I don't have an ax to grind against her, Cal,
I really don't.
You just don't trust my judgment where she's concerned, huh?
I don't want to see you get hurt.
Yeah.
Right.
It's a little late for that now.
For what?
I'm up to my neck in it.
Come on.
Prince John.
I dropped him off an hour ago.
Dr. Foster?
Can I have a word?
This isn't happening.
Did he do this?
He didn't say.
Does he know who did this?
If he did, we wouldn't be standing here talking about it.
Did you ask him?
He's a city cop 20 years.
You asked him.
Your worst nightmare-- he lied to you.
Incoming.
Detective Wallowski,
Internal Affairs.
Jenkins.
Weapon, please, Detective.
Or do you want me to arrest you out here?
Arrest her for what?
That.
On what evidence?
Eyewitness.
So I'm thinking, I distract the guards, and you start digging.
You got a spoon on you?
Or you could tell me the truth about Farr.
I'll get you out that way.
Look, Farr didn't kill Prince John.
You and I lifted him, an hour later he's back on the street, and that's why he's dead.
You don't believe that.
So I bit my lip.
Give me a break.
If one of those gang-bangers thinks you killed Prince John, this is the worst possible place you could be, love.
Mind if I speak with my partner now?
I'll get you that spoon.
What took you so long?
She's never gonna rat out her partner.
I mean, you can offer her any deal you like.
It's not going to happen.
Uh-huh.
So that's your science speaking, is it?
You need me.
Badly.
This is a department investigation, Dr. Lightman.
Do you want to look good for your career, or do you want to get this right and look even better?
If you are gaming me,
I will flush you down the toilet.
You and Wallowski.
Bollocks.
You got an innocent cop sitting in jail with a target on her back.
Wallowski's there because we have an eyewitness murder with no alibi.
You look me in the eye and you tell me you don't have skeletons.
'Cause you know if I start looking, I'll find them.
What do you want?
Detective Farr.
But...
Not here.
At my place.
My comfort zone, not yours.
And when you find dirt on that woman, Wallowski, which I know there is?
"That woman"?
Is that your science talking now?
Then you'll give her to me, too.
Woman, on tape:
I just saw a boy shot, 95th and Chalmers.
White lady cop threw him out her car, then started shooting.
Male 911 dispatcher:
And you said an officer was involved?
Wachowski, Willinski...
Something like that.
Works the gangs up here.
I thought I took your desk away.
This is the 911 tape of the eyewitness.
She has an evasive vocal tic.
The throat clearing-- she did it when she was making statements about Detective Wallowski.
Did you come up with this all by yourself?
And, if you listen to the tape in its entirety...
It was definitely her.
I recognized...
She gives unnecessary details.
Not answering questions directly.
She's lying.
Maybe she's just old.
Look, you keep doing that.
And it just gets funnier and funnier.
Where'd you get the 911 tape from, hey?
You're not the only one with police contacts.
What, Loker?
Afraid so.
Next time, however, will you run it by me first?
That throat clearing-- it's phlegm--she's a smoker.
African coffee.
Best on the planet.
Is that your son in there, Mrs. Phillips?
Oh, lord, no.
Grandson.
Louis.
He lives with me.
How do you take it?
A splash of milk, 2 sugars.
That's me.
Where in Africa?
Kenya.
Mrs. Phillips:
I know a guy knows a guy...
Second man:
Watch that chopper!
You trying to make your grandma deaf?
Leave her out of this.
Leave her out of what?
You a cop.
I can smell.
How old are you, then?
Nice ink, that.
That's the Nine-Sixes, is it?
You know, the proud, the few.
However it goes.
Comedian cop.
You just play your game.
You don't mind me, all right?
How about over here?
And whoever killed Prince John,
I wouldn't breathe a word about that if I were you.
I don't know nothin' about that.
Well, that's smart.
You see, you keep your mouth shut, you pick your side in this war carefully, 'cause you never know, right?
Next time it could be you, couldn't it?
Beat it, snow.
Damn.
I'd get that if I were you.
You never leave home without it, right?
Oh, yeah, 'cause I'm that stupid.
Keep it.
I'm straight.
Snow.
I'm beginning to like that.
It's growing on me.
Very creative, that.
I'm going over to Ronnie's house, grandma.
Be home for dinner.
It's your favorite.
Ronnie's house, my ass.
Here.
Merry Christmas.
It's a firing pin.
Just so long as he comes home is all.
Yeah.
What was I saying?
The shooting.
Prince John.
Yes.
I'm 110% certain it was the Wallowski girl who shot him.
I might be old, but I'm not blind.
You know, there's many different kinds of blindness.
Blind is blind.
Right, yeah.
Well, thanks for your time, Mrs. Phillips.
That's it?
What about your coffee?
Rain check.
Hi, mate.
Louis, I thought you was on your way to Ronnie's.
You lost?
Oh, look at you.
Lovely.
Matching ink.
You guys must really, really like each other.
Or something.
Not that there's anything wrong with that.
It's ok.
Good evening, all.
Another day in D.C., Professor.
Whew.
Blimey.
Well, at least your partner's got an alibi this time.
You know, her being in jail and that.
Who was he?
His street name's Stomper.
Local pharmaceutical rep for the Nine-Sixes.
Who's that one?
Hey?
What's he smiling about, eh?
He's not smiling.
Come on, calm down.
It's not a capital offense, you know.
Disperse those clowns.
What, you mean lift 'em, right?
I mean, they know the dead guy.
They're all in the same gang together.
Now, listen.
How you doin', mate?
Who's that one over there?
Oh.
He's that dangerous, is he?
How does Detective Farr know him?
Hit me in the stomach.
Back off, man.
Is he one of the ones grabbing for power?
Is he?
You hit me in the stomach, I'll pay you $50, with a smile.
Which one's gonna make you look better?
You're crazy.
Look, whoever killed Prince John killed your friend over there.
Right?
Who was it?
Not that lady cop.
Thanks for that.
All right, stomach, not face, all right?
Ohh!
That's cold.
Did you see that?
You ok?
Oh, no, I'm fine.
Cal.
You tell your I.A. Friend
I want to talk to that one there.
All right?
This isn't a gang war.
It's more like a gang at war with itself.
And he knows it.
He's part of it, he is.
He's even picked sides.
Two Nine-Sixes in two days, Suarez.
Busy man.
First off, he's not a man, so try "boy."
See what I mean?
You Call this science?
Well, it sells books, you know?
Ask him why he's so happy his own gang members are dead.
Speak.
You got nothin' on me.
The lady cop killed Prince John and set him up.
Why are you lying about her?
Do you need her out of the way?
You need her where she's easier to get to.
Right?
Inside.
I'm with you.
Killing cops is serious business.
Lawyer.
No need.
You're free to go.
Get out of here.
Hello.
You know him, do you?
I work gangs.
He's in a gang.
You seem exceptionally relieved to see him walking out of here a free man.
Let me guess.
He asked for a lawyer.
You've interviewed him, have you?
A few times, yeah.
Always with Wallowski?
I got one for you.
Did you tell Wallowski you were on the I.A. payroll when you started doing her?
And why have you kept me waiting out here?
No reason.
You can go now.
I want interrogation tape on him and Wallowski and any other Nine-Sixes.
Get out of here.
I would, but I got work to do.
Let me ask you something.
Is this about catching corrupt cops for you, or is this about saving your friend?
Because I still have an eyewitness.
So you were 2 blocks away when you heard the shots.
Is that right?
Why don't you let him tell us where he was.
I was 2 blocks away.
So in this one,
Farr is controlling the interrogation.
He's warning Suarez.
And then the next one.
We put you there.
We got witnesses.
We know J.T. has a beef with you.
We just want to hear your side of the story, that's all.
I need a break.
You finish this.
Wallowski walks out before the interrogation is over.
Well, they've been in there for 3 hours.
I mean, maybe she just needed a tinkle.
Or maybe she was letting Farr blow the interrogation.
Is there anything here you agree on?
Yes.
There's definitely some kind of relationship between Detective Farr and Suarez.
Agreed.
Farr does sound compromised at times.
Well, if Farr's dirty, Wallowski's dirty.
What's that?
What is that, guilt by association?
You may.
May I remind you-- you've got an eyewitness.
I haven't forgotten.
Wallowski's arraigned in the morning.
My hands are tied.
She goes to county, that's a death sentence.
Well, she either gives up her partner or she's on her own.
Thanks for your help.
Oh, you wanted me to lie.
I see now.
Mrs. Phillips, are you comfortable?
I saw what I saw.
Let's just get on with it, shall we?
Ok, we just have a quick video we'd like you to take a look at.
And when I turn it off, just give us as much detail about it as you can.
There were 3 people.
A couple holding hands, an old man in a ball cap, and a blue car parked.
Do you know what change blindness is, Mrs. Phillips?
Changed what?
Change blindness.
We see what we anticipate we're going to see, even if it changes.
The brain doesn't react to the change.
Right.
Like Charles here.
This was actually Loker just a minute ago.
So, you saw Wallowski drop Prince John off, but did you look away for any time before the shooting started?
I...
I think I was brewing coffee.
And then when the shooting started, you looked out the window, you saw the shooter, right?
Who you thought was the same person you saw with Prince John just moments earlier.
I was about to bring you that spoon.
How did you get me out?
Change blindness.
What you lookin' at, Flaco?
Lovely weather we're having.
I'm not talking about Farr.
Balmy for this time of year.
You want me to talk about Farr 'cause you're working with I.A., right?
That's how you got me out of jail, you're working some kind of deal?
Right.
Well, that's that out of the way, then.
Where do we go now?
Straight to sex?
Look, you know he's dirty, right?
It's not exactly breaking his heart selling you out, by the way.
What if he was?
And I'm not saying that he is.
Is what?
Dirty.
You just said it.
There are two types of dirty.
One is who you are and one happens to you.
Oh, Farr's a victim.
Do me a favor.
Want to know how it happens?
How what happens?
Corruption.
You did it again.
I'm too tired for this.
Well, humor me.
I brought the wine.
So we isolated some of her reactions during the Suarez interrogation.
First interview-- after a softball from Farr, she purses her lips, barely noticeable.
5 months later, she looks away, brow furrows, much more intense reaction.
In an interrogation last year, you see disgust around her nose, on her mouth.
And finally 6 weeks ago, her entire body shifts away from Farr and she leaves the room.
So, in terms of intensity, her disgust with Farr rises from an "a" to an "e"
in lock-step with Suarez's crimes.
As he went from joyriding to homicide.
She's known all along that Suarez and Farr had some kind of deal.
Lightman's watched all of these interviews.
How could he miss this?
Change blindness.
That's not bad for 7 bucks, eh?
You know about wine?
It's made from grapes.
What do you do when your partner busts a 14-year-old with a few grams of heroin?
You send them to juvie for a PhD.
In criminology or cut 'em a break?
I don't know.
You tell me.
You start small.
You just fudge some paperwork here and there.
Knock a banger around a bit, get a shooter out of him.
You know, that's all very interesting.
But not one mention of Detective Farr.
I'm trying to tell you, you get deep enough in, you can't get back out.
You know, two dead bodies is a world away from fudging a bit of paperwork, darlin', really.
So...
Get on with it, then.

How long you gonna pretend there's nothing going on between Suarez and Farr?
You want to talk about this now?
The I.A. leaned on my partner to lean on me to give you up.
Now, I'm being disloyal to my partner because you're being loyal to a man who's up to his neck in it.
You're saying Dr. Foster's wrong about me?
Like she's wrong about me sometimes.
It comes from a good place.
You ever hear of off-duty Booty?
Suarez is Farr's son.
I wouldn't do that if I were you, mate.
You.
Raises the blood pressure, you know?
I me, if you want a "get out of jail free" pass from the I.A., you might want to get it under control, mate.
All right, suit yourself.
But it does make your neck blob out a bit, you know?
Oh, yeah.
Wallowski?
Well, you can stick a fork in her and all, 'cause she's cooked.
You both are.
Did you know that someone shot up her house last night?
Oh, first you've heard of it.
Well, that's a good sign, I suppose.
You want to know who it was?
It was your boy Suarez.
And when I say your boy, what I mean is, your son.
19 years old.
Mowing his way through his own gang while you look the other way.
You ok?
I'm good.
And so is Suarez.
It starts simple.
Right?
You're just trying to do the right thing, like any real dad would.
You can't protect him anymore.
He tried killing you last night.
Choose.
Your partner...
Or your son.
Detective Farr.
Get me Lightman.
Now.
He's not in yet.
Well, he bends Farr's ear before the hearing,
Farr comes in and spills.
Suarez is his son.
He's been in the kid's pocket for years.
So you got your dirty cop.
Congratulations.
Farr's son killed Prince John and Stomper because he knew they were blackmailing Farr.
And Wallowski knew it, too.
She's dirty.
I mean, 8-hour days with Farr for 5 years?
It doesn't sound like proof.
Farr takes the heat, says Wallowski knows nothing.
Lying through his teeth, and Lightman put him up to it.
Oh, this isn't about Wallowski anymore, is it?
It's about Lightman.
You can choose--
Wallowski or your partner.
Because I will bring down this whole circus act if I have to.
Understand?
Do you need that in writing?
Her contempt for Farr's choices is getting harder to contain.
She knew about Suarez.
And you're sure about that?
Put her in the cube for long enough, and if she's guilty, she'll betray herself.
The muscles in your cheek, relax them.
No, no.
Hands down.
You cover your mouth, you give yourself away.
You know, if you teach me how to lie, you might never be able to trust me.
All right, pay attention.
Focus on what we're doing.
You're not helping me.
You're just trying to save yourself now.
That was good.
You hid the contempt.
There are 4 key emotions displayed here.
Disappointment, frustration, disgust, outrage.
And just like contempt, any of these would expose Wallowski's role in covering up Farr's crimes.
And you can show me what to look for?
And what to ask.
Ask her a question she doesn't expect.
That's where you'll find unfiltered emotion, something she won't be able to hide.
You knew there was a relationship between Farr and Suarez.
They were friendly.
Part of our work with gang unit is to connect with these kids.
But I had no idea until yesterday they were father and son.
Oh, that's good.
Nice.
Lying comes naturally to you.
Good teacher.
Just part your lips a little for surprise, you know.
They'll be looking for that.
I don't know if I can do this.
Of course you can.
I can't lose the one cop I can squeeze, on the street.
Tell me a lie.
Anything you like.
I hate you.
Now, that's brilliant.
You're ready.
You knew Detective Farr had a relationship with Marco Suarez?
We're meant to form relationships with street-level dealers.
But did you know he was helping Suarez commit crimes?
No.
I didn't know anything about that.
But you do know that he beat Prince John to cover his relationship with Suarez, to support Suarez's move to control the Nine-Sixes.
Now that he's confessed, sure, I guess.
Was Detective Farr a good father to his children?
Which ones?
To his regular family ones.
You mean his white ones.
Don't deflect the question, Detective.
I'm sorry, what was the question again?
Oh, yeah.
Uh, he's incredible with his kids.
Well, don't look at me, Loker.
Give it to them straight.
I get nothing here.
Zip.
Was Wallowski in on this with Farr or not?
She's been coached.
Or maybe she's clean.
And you Call yourself scientists?
You call cops who disagree cops?
Unless one of them's dirty.
Well, she's saying Wallowski's clean.
Aren't you, Dr. Foster?
Wait!
What are you walking away for, hey?
That's not right.
Don't do that.
Never mind.
I'm not going anywhere, Gill, so let's have it.
What do you see in her, Cal?
I'd have done the same thing for my partner.
It's called loyalty.
That's kind of ironic from where I'm standing.
Well?
Is Wallowski lying?
Yes.
Absolutely.
Farr is not a good dad.
She's covering for him.
As for the rest of it, she's not lying.
She didn't know anything about Suarez or any of it.
D--Dr.
Lightman?
Yeah, she's clean.

Bye.
How's the job hunt going?
It's a little tougher than you thought, is it, or...
All right, well, carry on.
Keep up the good work.
What?
All I was trying to say in there was, you know,
I want him on the street getting a life, not in there getting a latte.
Why don't you just tell him that, then?
And spoil all the fun?
Do me a favor.
Show me it.
Uh-oh.
This is Juan Ramirez, street name Prince John, of the Nine-Six clique.
Push in tighter.
That's, uh, Detective, uh...
What's his name again?
Farr.
Murderous hatred.
What happens next?
So what part of you is thinking "I told you so"?
Internal Affairs.
They've been watching Wallowski for a while.
Apparently it's not uncommon to run surveillance on gang unit cops.
You got this from I.A.?
They came to me with it, because of your relationship with Wallowski, which somehow they know about.
All right, look at her.
She's pissed off.
At her partner.
She tried to stop him.
It could be argued that she did that once the other cops arrived on the scene.
It could also be argued that you thought having a compromised cop in your pocket was a good idea and there was nothing I could do or say to warn you.
This is a message to you from Internal Affairs.
Your new friend Wallowski is under the microscope.
And they want me to stay out of it.
You want me to stay out of it.
Dr. Lightman.
What do you want?
Every cop in the city have passed their fitness test.
Police range.
Police personnel only.
What's Prince John got on you that makes you want to kill him, eh?
Have a nice day.
It's not so much fun killing cardboard, is it?
Let me guess.
You've seen the video.
Yeah.
You want to know how I got it?
I.A. gave me that tape.
Now, why would they be watching you, do you think, in your humble opinion?
What you saw on that tape is my partner subduing a suspect.
Trying to kill him, more like.
Corner kids like Prince John, they keep guns in the wheel Wells of nearby cars.
He was going for a hidden gun.
Oh, so where's the gun now, then, in a police evidence locker somewhere?
You working with I.A. Now?
If I was, you'd be in the cop shop.
Answer a simple question-- what's going on between you and your partner?
What are you hiding?
You know, you do that whole tough guy cop thing really well, but do me a favor--save it for the customers, all right?
Look, Prince John, he's a mid-level dealer with the Nine-Sixes.
All right.
So if there was a reason to arrest him yesterday, what's he doing on the street today, then?
Herman Farr is a good man, period.
What your partner did on that tape is the beginning of the end for both of you.
What do you care?
I'm just the cop that you like to squeeze on the street, in the sack, wherever.
In the sack?
That's a bit previous, isn't it?
That beating was personal.
Prince John has something on your partner, and you know exactly what it is.
Which makes you a target as well.
I can take care of myself, thank you.
Give us a go, then.
You know, you do need my help.
You just don't know how to ask for it.
Do you?
All right.
Hey.
Easy, tiger.
I'll drive.

It's Prince John, right?
Do you know what a prince is where I come from?
What did you say?
No--well, that as well.
But I wasn't talking about your sexual preferences.
A prince, where I come from, is a burden on the taxpayer.
Settle.
She's been practicing.
Beat it, snow?
What's she gonna find on you if she pats you down, eh?
Seriously.
What's she gonna plant on him, you mean?
Eight ball with your name on it in this pocket right here.
Ask your question.
Go on.
What you got on my partner?
I know he's fat.
[Laughing]
You see, I think you can do better than that, really.
Mm-Hmm.
Don't you, Wallowski?
You know the drill.
[Handcuffs jangling]
I mean, we gotta go.
[Indistinct chatter]
I'll be back.
You be all right?
Let's go.
That tune-up that Detective Farr gave you, was personal, right?
So that means either you have unfinished business or Detective Farr's on the take.
Or, you've got something he wants.
Tune-up?
Nah.
Well, I got it.
Option 2.
Detective Farr's on the take.
That's not news to you.
What-- you gonna take his word over a decorated cop?
That was no ordinary beating.
Farr wanted to kill him.
Which is why the Prince here is on the run.
What, you see me running?
My advice to you...
Dust off your sneakers...
Princess.
We done?
I need a ride home.
Well...
Protect and serve.
This is the serve part.
We found that Wallowski has a number of interesting reactions.
Pursed lips and puffed cheeks indicate resignation.
Widened eyes show fear.
Oh, yeah?
We're breaking down the videos into micro-expressions.
I'll break you down into micro-expressions in a minute.
Put your hand on your heart and tell me you think Wallowski's clean.
What, you mean clean like you?
Give us the room.
Now, look, I didn't mean that in a bad way.
I know what you meant.
Have a seat.
Now what, nurse?
You came up on I.A.'s radar the minute you and Wallowski decided to start seeing each other.
That's a business meeting, that.
I don't have an ax to grind against her, Cal,
I really don't.
[Cell phone rings]
You just don't trust my judgment where she's concerned, huh?
I don't want to see you get hurt.
Yeah.
Right.
It's a little late for that now.
For what?
I'm up to my neck in it.
Come on.
[Helicopter]
Prince John.
I dropped him off an hour ago.
[Siren]
Dr. Foster?
Can I have a word?
This isn't happening.
Did he do this?
He didn't say.
Does he know who did this?
If he did, we wouldn't be standing here talking about it.
Did you ask him?
He's a city cop 20 years.
You asked him.
Your worst nightmare-- he lied to you.
Incoming.
Detective Wallowski,
Internal Affairs.
Jenkins.
Weapon, please, Detective.
Or do you want me to arrest you out here?
Arrest her for what?
That.
On what evidence?
Eyewitness.
[Door buzzes open]
So I'm thinking, I distract the guards, and you start digging.
You got a spoon on you?
Or you could tell me the truth about Farr.
I'll get you out that way.
Look, Farr didn't kill Prince John.
You and I lifted him, an hour later he's back on the street, and that's why he's dead.
You don't believe that.
So I bit my lip.
Give me a break.
If one of those gang-bangers thinks you killed Prince John, this is the worst possible place you could be, love.
Mind if I speak with my partner now?
I'll get you that spoon.
[Door buzzes open]
What took you so long?
She's never gonna rat out her partner.
I mean, you can offer her any deal you like.
It's not going to happen.
Uh-huh.
So that's your science speaking, is it?
You need me.
Badly.
This is a department investigation, Dr. Lightman.
Do you want to look good for your career, or do you want to get this right and look even better?
If you are gaming me,
I will flush you down the toilet.
You and Wallowski.
Bollocks.
You got an innocent cop sitting in jail with a target on her back.
Wallowski's there because we have an eyewitness murder with no alibi.
You look me in the eye and you tell me you don't have skeletons.
'Cause you know if I start looking, I'll find them.
What do you want?
Detective Farr.
But...
Not here.
At my place.
My comfort zone, not yours.
And when you find dirt on that woman, Wallowski, which I know there is?
"That woman"?
Is that your science talking now?
Then you'll give her to me, too.
Woman, on tape:
I just saw a boy shot, 95th and Chalmers.
White lady cop threw him out her car, then started shooting.
Male 911 dispatcher:
And you said an officer was involved?
Woman:
Wachowski, Willinski...
[Clears throat]
Something like that.
Works the gangs up here.
I thought I took your desk away.
This is the 911 tape of the eyewitness.
She has an evasive vocal tic.
The throat clearing-- she did it when she was making statements about Detective Wallowski.
Did you come up with this all by yourself?
And, if you listen to the tape in its entirety...
Woman:
It was definitely her.
I recognized...
She gives unnecessary details.
Not answering questions directly.
She's lying.
Maybe she's just old.
Look, you keep doing that.
And it just gets funnier and funnier.
Where'd you get the 911 tape from, hey?
You're not the only one with police contacts.
What, Loker?
Afraid so.
Next time, however, will you run it by me first?
That throat clearing-- it's phlegm--she's a smoker.
[Video game sound effects playing]
African coffee.
Best on the planet.
[Video game sound effects]
Is that your son in there, Mrs. Phillips?
Oh, lord, no.
Grandson.
Louis.
He lives with me.
How do you take it?
A splash of milk, 2 sugars.
That's me.
Where in Africa?
Kenya.
Mrs. Phillips:
I know a guy knows a guy...
[Man shouts on video game]
Second man:
Watch that chopper!
You trying to make your grandma deaf?
Leave her out of this.
[Weapons fire, man shouts, dog barks]
[Turns down volume]
Leave her out of what?
You a cop.
I can smell.
How old are you, then?
Nice ink, that.
That's the Nine-Sixes, is it?
You know, the proud, the few.
However it goes.
Comedian cop.
You just play your game.
You don't mind me, all right?
How about over here?
And whoever killed Prince John,
I wouldn't breathe a word about that if I were you.
I don't know nothin' about that.
Well, that's smart.
You see, you keep your mouth shut, you pick your side in this war carefully, 'cause you never know, right?
Next time it could be you, couldn't it?
Beat it, snow.
Damn.
[Beeping]
I'd get that if I were you.
You never leave home without it, right?
Oh, yeah, 'cause I'm that stupid.
Keep it.
I'm straight.
Snow.
I'm beginning to like that.
It's growing on me.
Very creative, that.
I'm going over to Ronnie's house, grandma.
Be home for dinner.
It's your favorite.
Ronnie's house, my ass.
Here.
Merry Christmas.
It's a firing pin.
Just so long as he comes home is all.
Yeah.
What was I saying?
The shooting.
Prince John.
Yes.
I'm 110% certain it was the Wallowski girl who shot him.
I might be old, but I'm not blind.
[Tires screeching]
[Loud engine]
You know, there's many different kinds of blindness.
Blind is blind.
Right, yeah.
Well, thanks for your time, Mrs. Phillips.
That's it?
What about your coffee?
Rain check.
[Helicopter]
[Indistinct police radio]
Hi, mate.
Louis, I thought you was on your way to Ronnie's.
You lost?
Oh, look at you.
Lovely.
Matching ink.
You guys must really, really like each other.
Or something.
Not that there's anything wrong with that.
[Clicks tongue]
Farr:
It's ok.
Good evening, all.
Another day in D.C., Professor.
Cal:
Whew.
Blimey.
Well, at least your partner's got an alibi this time.
You know, her being in jail and that.
Who was he?
His street name's Stomper.
Local pharmaceutical rep for the Nine-Sixes.
Who's that one?
Hey?
What's he smiling about, eh?
He's not smiling.
Come on, calm down.
It's not a capital offense, you know.
Disperse those clowns.
What, you mean lift 'em, right?
I mean, they know the dead guy.
They're all in the same gang together.
Now, listen.
How you doin', mate?
Who's that one over there?
Oh.
He's that dangerous, is he?
How does Detective Farr know him?
Hit me in the stomach.
Back off, man.
Is he one of the ones grabbing for power?
Is he?
You hit me in the stomach, I'll pay you $50, with a smile.
Which one's gonna make you look better?
You're crazy.
Look, whoever killed Prince John killed your friend over there.
Right?
Who was it?
Not that lady cop.
Thanks for that.
All right, stomach, not face, all right?
[Laughing] Ohh!
That's cold.
[Laughing continues]
Did you see that?
You ok?
Oh, no, I'm fine.
Cal.
You tell your I.A. Friend
I want to talk to that one there.
All right?
This isn't a gang war.
It's more like a gang at war with itself.
And he knows it.
He's part of it, he is.
He's even picked sides.
Two Nine-Sixes in two days, Suarez.
Busy man.
First off, he's not a man, so try "boy."
See what I mean?
You Call this science?
Well, it sells books, you know?
Ask him why he's so happy his own gang members are dead.
Speak.
You got nothin' on me.
The lady cop killed Prince John and set him up.
Why are you lying about her?
Do you need her out of the way?
You need her where she's easier to get to.
Right?
Inside.
I'm with you.
Killing cops is serious business.
Lawyer.
No need.
You're free to go.
Get out of here.
Hello.
You know him, do you?
I work gangs.
He's in a gang.
You seem exceptionally relieved to see him walking out of here a free man.
Let me guess.
He asked for a lawyer.
You've interviewed him, have you?
A few times, yeah.
Always with Wallowski?
I got one for you.
Did you tell Wallowski you were on the I.A. payroll when you started doing her?
And why have you kept me waiting out here?
No reason.
You can go now.
I want interrogation tape on him and Wallowski and any other Nine-Sixes.
Get out of here.
I would, but I got work to do.
Let me ask you something.
Is this about catching corrupt cops for you, or is this about saving your friend?
Because I still have an eyewitness.
So you were 2 blocks away when you heard the shots.
Is that right?
Why don't you let him tell us where he was.
I was 2 blocks away.
So in this one,
Farr is controlling the interrogation.
He's warning Suarez.
And then the next one.
We put you there.
We got witnesses.
We know J.T. has a beef with you.
We just want to hear your side of the story, that's all.
I need a break.
You finish this.
Wallowski walks out before the interrogation is over.
Well, they've been in there for 3 hours.
I mean, maybe she just needed a tinkle.
Or maybe she was letting Farr blow the interrogation.
Is there anything here you agree on?
Yes.
There's definitely some kind of relationship between Detective Farr and Suarez.
Agreed.
Farr does sound compromised at times.
Well, if Farr's dirty, Wallowski's dirty.
What's that?
What is that, guilt by association?
You may.
May I remind you-- you've got an eyewitness.
I haven't forgotten.
Wallowski's arraigned in the morning.
My hands are tied.
She goes to county, that's a death sentence.
Well, she either gives up her partner or she's on her own.
Thanks for your help.
Oh, you wanted me to lie.
I see now.
Mrs. Phillips, are you comfortable?
I saw what I saw.
[Clears throat] Let's just get on with it, shall we?
Ok, we just have a quick video we'd like you to take a look at.
And when I turn it off, just give us as much detail about it as you can.
There were 3 people.
A couple holding hands, an old man in a ball cap, and a blue car parked.
Do you know what change blindness is, Mrs. Phillips?
Changed what?
Change blindness.
We see what we anticipate we're going to see, even if it changes.
The brain doesn't react to the change.
Right.
Like Charles here.
This was actually Loker just a minute ago.
So, you saw Wallowski drop Prince John off, but did you look away for any time before the shooting started?
I...
I think I was brewing coffee.
And then when the shooting started, you looked out the window, you saw the shooter, right?
Who you thought was the same person you saw with Prince John just moments earlier.
I was about to bring you that spoon.
How did you get me out?
Change blindness.
What you lookin' at, Flaco?
Lovely weather we're having.
I'm not talking about Farr.
Balmy for this time of year.
You want me to talk about Farr 'cause you're working with I.A., right?
That's how you got me out of jail, you're working some kind of deal?
Right.
Well, that's that out of the way, then.
Where do we go now?
Straight to sex?
Look, you know he's dirty, right?
It's not exactly breaking his heart selling you out, by the way.
What if he was?
And I'm not saying that he is.
Is what?
Dirty.
You just said it.
There are two types of dirty.
One is who you are and one happens to you.
Oh, Farr's a victim.
Do me a favor.
Want to know how it happens?
How what happens?
Corruption.
You did it again.
I'm too tired for this.
Well, humor me.
I brought the wine.
So we isolated some of her reactions during the Suarez interrogation.
First interview-- after a softball from Farr, she purses her lips, barely noticeable.
5 months later, she looks away, brow furrows, much more intense reaction.
In an interrogation last year, you see disgust around her nose, on her mouth.
And finally 6 weeks ago, her entire body shifts away from Farr and she leaves the room.
So, in terms of intensity, her disgust with Farr rises from an "a" to an "e"
in lock-step with Suarez's crimes.
As he went from joyriding to homicide.
She's known all along that Suarez and Farr had some kind of deal.
Lightman's watched all of these interviews.
How could he miss this?
Change blindness.
That's not bad for 7 bucks, eh?
You know about wine?
It's made from grapes.
What do you do when your partner busts a 14-year-old with a few grams of heroin?
You send them to juvie for a PhD.
In criminology or cut 'em a break?
I don't know.
You tell me.
You start small.
You just fudge some paperwork here and there.
Knock a banger around a bit, get a shooter out of him.
You know, that's all very interesting.
But not one mention of Detective Farr.
I'm trying to tell you, you get deep enough in, you can't get back out.
You know, two dead bodies is a world away from fudging a bit of paperwork, darlin', really.
So...
Get on with it, then.

How long you gonna pretend there's nothing going on between Suarez and Farr?
You want to talk about this now?
The I.A. leaned on my partner to lean on me to give you up.
Now, I'm being disloyal to my partner because you're being loyal to a man who's up to his neck in it.
You're saying Dr. Foster's wrong about me?
Like she's wrong about me sometimes.
It comes from a good place.
You ever hear of off-duty Booty?
Suarez is Farr's son.
I wouldn't do that if I were you, mate.
You.
Raises the blood pressure, you know?
I me, if you want a "get out of jail free" pass from the I.A., you might want to get it under control, mate.
All right, suit yourself.
But it does make your neck blob out a bit, you know?
Oh, yeah.
Wallowski?
Well, you can stick a fork in her and all, 'cause she's cooked.
You both are.
Did you know that someone shot up her house last night?
Oh, first you've heard of it.
Well, that's a good sign, I suppose.
You want to know who it was?
It was your boy Suarez.
And when I say your boy, what I mean is, your son.
19 years old.
Mowing his way through his own gang while you look the other way.
You ok?
I'm good.
And so is Suarez.
It starts simple.
Right?
You're just trying to do the right thing, like any real dad would.
You can't protect him anymore.
He tried killing you last night.
Choose.
Your partner...
Or your son.
[Door opens]
Detective Farr.
Get me Lightman.
Now.
He's not in yet.
Well, he bends Farr's ear before the hearing,
Farr comes in and spills.
Suarez is his son.
He's been in the kid's pocket for years.
So you got your dirty cop.
Congratulations.
Farr's son killed Prince John and Stomper because he knew they were blackmailing Farr.
And Wallowski knew it, too.
She's dirty.
I mean, 8-hour days with Farr for 5 years?
It doesn't sound like proof.
Farr takes the heat, says Wallowski knows nothing.
Lying through his teeth, and Lightman put him up to it.
Oh, this isn't about Wallowski anymore, is it?
It's about Lightman.
You can choose--
Wallowski or your partner.
Because I will bring down this whole circus act if I have to.
Understand?
Do you need that in writing?
Her contempt for Farr's choices is getting harder to contain.
She knew about Suarez.
And you're sure about that?
Put her in the cube for long enough, and if she's guilty, she'll betray herself.
The muscles in your cheek, relax them.
No, no.
Hands down.
You cover your mouth, you give yourself away.
You know, if you teach me how to lie, you might never be able to trust me.
All right, pay attention.
Focus on what we're doing.
You're not helping me.
You're just trying to save yourself now.
That was good.
You hid the contempt.
There are 4 key emotions displayed here.
Disappointment, frustration, disgust, outrage.
And just like contempt, any of these would expose Wallowski's role in covering up Farr's crimes.
And you can show me what to look for?
And what to ask.
Ask her a question she doesn't expect.
That's where you'll find unfiltered emotion, something she won't be able to hide.
You knew there was a relationship between Farr and Suarez.
They were friendly.
Part of our work with gang unit is to connect with these kids.
But I had no idea until yesterday they were father and son.
Oh, that's good.
Nice.
Lying comes naturally to you.
Good teacher.
Just part your lips a little for surprise, you know.
They'll be looking for that.
I don't know if I can do this.
Of course you can.
I can't lose the one cop I can squeeze, on the street.
Tell me a lie.
Anything you like.
I hate you.
Now, that's brilliant.
You're ready.
You knew Detective Farr had a relationship with Marco Suarez?
We're meant to form relationships with street-level dealers.
But did you know he was helping Suarez commit crimes?
No.
I didn't know anything about that.
But you do know that he beat Prince John to cover his relationship with Suarez, to support Suarez's move to control the Nine-Sixes.
Now that he's confessed, sure, I guess.
Was Detective Farr a good father to his children?
Which ones?
To his regular family ones.
You mean his white ones.
Don't deflect the question, Detective.
I'm sorry, what was the question again?
Oh, yeah.
Uh, he's incredible with his kids.
Well, don't look at me, Loker.
Give it to them straight.
I get nothing here.
Zip.
Was Wallowski in on this with Farr or not?
She's been coached.
Or maybe she's clean.
And you Call yourself scientists?
You call cops who disagree cops?
Unless one of them's dirty.
Well, she's saying Wallowski's clean.
Aren't you, Dr. Foster?
Wait!
What are you walking away for, hey?
That's not right.
Don't do that.
Never mind.
I'm not going anywhere, Gill, so let's have it.
What do you see in her, Cal?
I'd have done the same thing for my partner.
It's called loyalty.
That's kind of ironic from where I'm standing.
Well?
Is Wallowski lying?
Yes.
Absolutely.
Farr is not a good dad.
She's covering for him.
As for the rest of it, she's not lying.
She didn't know anything about Suarez or any of it.
D--Dr.
Lightman?
Yeah, she's clean.
As a whistle.

Listen to me.
I want you to listen very carefully.

Hey, come here.
Wow, you have grown big.
Is it here?
Here?
You are almost a grown-up now.
Take your hands off!
Soohee, can you come to my office?
I'd like to have a word with you.
Please, make yourself at home.
You've grown so much.
I took you in when you were five years old.
Do you remember it?
And do you still remember what I told you?
A secret between you, me and God.
You promised me, right?
No one must know.
No one.
Not even your mother, my wife.
Remember that?
Have you broken your vow?
If you have, be honest with God, and confess.
The almighty knows everything.
Yes
As God has answered your prayer, you'll live in a large house with a big family soon.
Then, you'll share your task with other people...
You've become really beautiful.
Lots of boys must be at your heels.
Any of them interest you?
There is.
You can tell me.
Who?
I see.
Do you know what it means to get married?
To live with a man and a woman, together.
That's what marriage it.
And to share food and...
bed together.
I really thank you for assisting me in doing God's work.
So I'd like to offer you a present.
I want you to take one of the rooms, a beautiful one, when the construction is over.
You and Minsoo can live together in that beautiful room.
And that's how a couple becomes a husband and wife.
Why are you still here?
All of you, get out!
Stay in bed, Jieun.
Don't get up.
Stay in bed.
Soohee, I don't want you to attend the service today.
Go and wash.
Put this on and wait for me.
Hurry up, get inside.
What's the matter with you?
Get in!
What's wrong with you?
Get in!
Get in, now!

Please follow me.
Please have a seat.
Sit here.
Would you like a tea?
Is it okay?
The bride can go to the fitting room.
Please follow me.
Please stand.
I want you to follow me.
This way.
Please go in that way.
Normally, to bring out the slim waistline, we usually tighten around it a bit.
But I'll have to loosen it up a bit here.
I'll put the earrings on.
If it's uncomfortable, let me know.
You look beautiful.
Could you lower your head a little.
How is it now?
Okay?
It looks great on you.
Everyone, stop what you're doing
Come and sit down.
Soohee, are you okay?
I know more than anyone how hard you work here.
But I can't let others do your work.
This is a place where we volunteered to work and serve.
You are my family.
You understand that, don't you, Soohee?
And if people from outside ask you a lot questions,
Don't try to answer them.
If you still want to be part of this family,
You have to watch your mouth.
You understand, right?
Good.
I mean, you don't want to go anywhere else, right?
How are you?
It's so great to see you.
Hello, good to see you all.
Who's the most good-looking gentleman here.
I see two already.
Then, which lady is the most gorgeous?
Let have a seat.
Careful
I saw you over there before, but it's great to see you here again.
Jungsook's here, too.
I've brought a set of questionnaires for you to answer to find out how all of you are doing.
I'm handing them out now, and I want you to circle the ones that correspond to your answer.
It asks what you had for your meal today.
I'm sure you all remember what you had today, right?
Let's take a look.
Did you have rice, soup, or Kimchee?
Circle the one you had.
What did you eat?
You haven't eaten?
If you haven't, you can skip it.
Hello.
You must be Soohee
I've heard a lot of things about you.
I was very concerned about you and your friends at this institution.
I came to find out if there is anything you need
I have a few questions to ask, if you don't mind.
Could you be honest with me?
You must not lie, okay?
Ever.
Then, I'll get started.
What did you have for your meal today?
Kimchee pot stew?
Is it warm enough here?
Has anyone come in physical contact with you?
I mean, has anyone physically abused or hurt you?
I want to ask another question.
Are you happy now?
Or no?
Yes, happy?
Has anyone touched you?
Have a look here.
I see, you like to hold dolls
The doll you are holding, is it a boy or a girl?
A boy?
How about this?
A girl?
Has anyone touched you here?
Were you dressed or not?
Like this
This is a man.
Look.
What did this male doll do to this female doll?
Okay, it sat on it.
Where did it touch?
Right here, like this?
Were you lying down like this doll right here?
And this male sat on top of you, and did what?
Sow me how it was done
He moved back and forth like this?
Did he have his pants on?
Was he naked?
Did you see his genitals?
No?
What happened?
Show it to me.
He sat like this.
Touched you here?
And what else did he do?
No.
You said "no" to him.
You kept saying no, but he kept forcing it.
Who is this man?
If you tell me who he is, I'll stop him from doing it again.
If you tell me who this is,
I can go tell him not to do that again.
Tell me who this is.
Let's go inside.
I can't leave her here, not like this.
I'll see to it that restraint for protection is issued for her.
She's my family
I'm her legal guardian
I've raised her for over a decade.
I'm doing everything in compliance with the law.
I'm not trying to stop you from doing your job properly.
I understand your position.
Come on, let's get inside the office and talk this over.
You at least owe me an explanation.
Let's just all relax.
Let's go in.
I can't believe what's happening.
Get out.
Get out now.
Get out!
Take it easy
We are almost there.
This is your new home.
You are here.
Let's go in Soohee
You must be Soohee, let's get inside.
Sit
Soohee, do you like this place.
You will be staying here.
And she will be your gurdian.
Nice to meet you, Soohee
She's gone through a lot today.
Please look after her.
Soohee, it's been a long day.
Let's get some rest today, and tomorrow I'll prepare a room for you to stay
Let's wash up.
Put the doll here before you wash.
Everything is going to fine.
Let's go
Tooth brushes are in the drawers.
The water is warm enough now.
Get cleaned.
Who are you?
Who the heck is this?
Who is she?
She's new here.
Go back to bed.
Soohee, let's be a little more careful.
Are you okay?
I'll do it.
I'll give you a scrub.
It's okay.
Please go get some rest.
I'll take care of it here.
I'll wash her up here, and put her to bed today.
Thank you, she's had a tough day today.
I appreciate what you are doing.
Soohee, keep still.
Tired?
We are almost done.
This is your pants, right?
I was doing the laundry and found them.
Get a goodnight sleep.
I'll wake you up in the morning.
We'll go see a doctor first thing in the morning after breakfast.
Soohee, what's the matter?
Soohee, come this way
It's alright.
Why do I have to move?
You are really getting on my nerve this morning.
I want you to move your stuff as I said.
As you said?
Maybe you should follow your own advice.
Soohee, let's go in
Come around everyone
What is it?
She'll be staying with us, starting today
She's the eldest among you so make sure to show your respect, and to.
Help her settle in.
This way
This is your room, Soohee
This is my room, okay?
Hold on for a second
Bless us Lord with good health, so that we may do your work here on Earth.
Through Christ our Lord, Amen.
I'll check your weight now.
Yes, let go
Please step on the scales with the shoes off.
Let's take off the shoes.
45Kg.
I'd like to now check your blood pressure.
I'll do that.
You're all set.
She's four or five months pregnant judging by the size of her belly.
Her weight is 42kg.
Pregnant women at this stage usually weigh 5 or 6 kg more than their normal weight.
I'm concerned about her health.
You see the movement?
It's the movement in the water.
Have you felt your intestine being pulled or pushed?
It's the movement of the fetus.
You can now see the whole fetus, the fingers, head, and the spine.
The arms are raised, and that round-shaped object, that's the head.
Hand me the rag.
Sit over here.
I told you you don't have to clean.
Soohee!
Listen very carefully, Soohee.
Where did I say we were going tomorrow?
Right.
What did I say you must say to the investigators?
Right, the people who are responsible for all this.
Let's make sure they never do this again.
Who took off your clothes?
Soohee, tell them everything you told me the other day.
People here all want to help you.
You told me the other day that the man sat on top of you, right?
Did he proceed to undress you soon after?
Listen, you must be cooperative!
You believe in God, right, Soohee?
God says you must not lie, right?
You swung your arms around in resistance, but he stripped you naked and beat you.
If you indentify who he is,
People here will make sure he never does that again.
You have to tell us who he is.
Who?
Clearly
Clearly and slowly
Anything bothering you now?
You don't seem well.
Ultransound test shows that the baby is healthy.
It's about the size of 5 months old fetus, as it should, and nothing abnormal shows.
I'm just a little concerned about the mother.
Her weight should be 5 or 6 kg more by now.
You should eat well until the delivery.
She should consume more calcium.
Having a bigger tummy is going to put a strain on her back.
Sister, come this way.
Sit here.
Would you want me give you a manicure?
I like this one.
Let's try this.
Look?
You like it?
Soohee, you haven't washed, right?
Let's go, I'll give you a bath.
Come on, stand.
There is a baby growing inside you.
After it has spent its time in you, the baby will come out into the world,
When the baby comes out, it can't do anything, and all it will do is cry.
That's why the father and the mother have to do their utmost best to look after it.
The baby inside you does not have a father.
And this is not your fault.
It's the fault of the bad people.
Soon, the baby will come out into the world.
When it does, you must send the baby to a place
Where it can be tended and raised properly by a father and a mother.
Right now, you are not well.
Forget everything that has happened to you.
No one knows what happened.
Soohee, you have to start fresh.
Now, we are done.
What's wrong, Soohee?
What?
Soohee!
Jellystone Park.
One of the nation's oldest and most beautiful stretches of wilderness.
For years, families have headed out from the busy city eager to enjoy a little camping, fishing and, of course, observing the park's natural wildlife.
Boo Boo, I think it's time I introduced myself to that pic-a-nic basket.
You know, Yogi, we could just hunt for food.
All the other animals do.
Boo Boo, a pic-a-nic basket has everything a bear needs.
And I'm not just talking about the treats and snack-type goodies.
No.
A pic-a-nic basket holds a lot more than that.
It holds dreams.
What are we looking at?
I don't know.
Hook me in.
You sure it'll work, Yogi?
Well, you know, Boo Boo, I'm smarter than the average bear!
All right!
Ranger Smith!
Sorry about that.
We got a 4-23 in Redwood Valley, sir.
-A what?
-A bear disturbance.
-I think it's probably--
-I know who it is.
Why didn't you just say "bear disturbance"?
Well, I....
Uh, well, it sounds cooler.
I mean, we're park rangers, sir.
You know:
"To protect and preserve."
Did you just make that motto up?
Yeah, I did.
Do you like it?
Ranger Jones, you know that, well, being a park ranger, it's not about mottos.
It's about keeping the park safe.
That's where the glory is.
Protecting all of this.
Yeah, I know.
Besides, that motto was still in the testing phase.
It's not like I made T-shirts or anything.
Heh, no, of course not.
Okay, I'm gonna deal with that 4-23.
Okay, copy that, sir.
Um, I'm actually gonna hop in the Armadillo, make some rounds.
Jones, you know that the Armadillo is for head ranger use only.
I might need it at any moment to deal with a park emergency.
Why don't you finish stacking those trail maps?
Yeah, sure.
Okay.
Yeah, because that's what future head rangers do, they stack maps.
Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy!
Our days of getting banged up to grab a meal are over, Boo Boo.
From now on, the pic-a-nic baskets are going to fall into our arms.
Soldering iron.
-Here you go.
-Thank you.
Okay.
That should do it.
Test rock.
Okay, Yogi.
Weight sensor triggered.
Basket in position.
Launch spring starts coiling.
Firing pin drops.
And....
Bull's-eye!
I'm so smart it hurts!
You're standing on the soldering iron.
Or it's that.
Hot, hot, hot!
There's the test rock.
Now we just wait here for a pic-a-nic basket to fall into our arms.
Are you sure about this, Yogi?
People seem to get pretty mad when you--
A genius never questions his instincts, Boo Boo.
When you have a mind like mine you can't blink or you'll put a kink in your think.
Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.
We've got our first customers.
And they have pie!
I wonder what kind it is.
Yogi, are you out here?
-It's Mr. Ranger.
-Aah!
Get rid of the test rock.
Destroy the evidence.
I was never here.
Look-
- Ow!
Hello, Mr. Ranger, sir.
Did you just--?
Did you guys--?
Did you--?
Oh, never mind.
Look, there was a complaint about a bear interfering with a family picnic.
I see.
And you'd like us to mount some sort of investigation?
No, I think it was you.
What?
!
How can you even think that?
Are you feverish?
Let me press my lips against your forehead.
Wait!
You're not pressing your lips against my forehead.
Hey, it's a lot better than the way they take my temperature.
No, look, Yogi, we've been over this many times.
Bears are supposed to avoid people, not run around stealing their food.
I agree, sir.
That's why my friend Boo Boo and I would never think of disturbing a family's pic-a-nic.
Huh.
It missed.
Good day, Mr. Ranger, sir.
We'll keep our eyes peeled.
I wonder if he noticed the pie.
Ra-
- Smith.
You have a vis-
- Over.
Didn't understand a word of that, Jones.
-Sorry.
Some lady's here to see you.
-Send her in.
-Okay.
I'll be in the Armadillo.
-Or you could be....
-Map stacking?
-Map stacking.
-Ranger Smith?
-Yes.
-Hello.
I'm Rachel Johnson.
-Hi.
I was hoping to talk to you about filming a documentary here.
Sure.
I can handle you for that.
Handle that for you.
Sorry.
My work isn't-- My brain isn't working right.
-I must have inhaled some jimsonweed.
-Oh.
Datura stramonium.
It's known to cause delirium...
-...cramping and nausea.
Heh.
-Cramping and nausea.
You've read The North American Wilderness Guide.
Yeah, I like to highlight all the plants and animals I see.
-I like to-
- Me too.
-Ha, ha!
Yeah.
Ranger Smith.
At your service.
You want to film a documentary in Jellystone?
Yes.
I sent you a letter about a month ago.
-Written on a piece of bark.
-That was you!
Yes.
I'm sorry about that.
I was in Sumatra, living among the orangutans at the time and they get very nervous if they spot anything from the modern world.
Really?
Wow, that's amazing.
Then what did you use for ink?
Bird poop and spit.
Impressive.
So, what are you here to film?
Well, I was hoping to shoot a local species.
Something to really capture the beauty of a national park.
Terrific.
What animal were you thinking?
I heard you had an unusual brown bear.
-Brown bear?
-Yes.
One that talks?
Those are so rare.
-None that I can think of.
-Named Yogi?
Wears a hat and a tie?
No, that doesn't ring a bell.
I think he's standing on the roof, trying to steal your lunchbox.
I smell PB and J.
I'm all done.
Oh, right.
That Yogi.
Bankrupt?
No, no, no.
We're a city.
Cities don't go bankrupt.
They do when they're broke, sir.
We just have to find some money somewhere.
I'm about to run for governor.
How am I gonna do that when my own city is bankrupt?
Okay, yes.
Thank you.
-Here's the invoice, Mr. Mayor.
-Yikes!
Wow.
Ha.
I'm gonna pretend I didn't see that.
Just bill it to the city, okay?
Thank you.
Ugh.
How did we ever go so broke?
-I think we just spent too much.
-Hmm.
Is there anything we can sell?
You already sold the public golf course to condo developers two of the three fire stations to that frozen yogurt company.
You were selling the library, but it burned down.
Oh, yeah.
That was gonna be one of those make-your-own-doughnut places.
-No.
-Yeah.
-If you could dream it up, you could make it.
-Ah.
Love those.
We gotta think of something here.
Well, if we don't have anything to sell, maybe we can profit off what we can't sell.
I don't understand those words.
Like when we sold the bottling rights to the water in Lake Beuclair.
-We made a fortune.
-Yeah.
Sinkhole Beuclair is a great place to throw old mattresses.
-Oh, yeah.
-Hmm.
We just don't have any more resources to exploit.
Or do we?
Jellystone.
If we rezone Jellystone Park as agricultural land, we can sell the logging rights.
Here.
This company says they'll give us thousands of dollars an acre just to cut down the trees or something.
That'll be enough to balance the budget and give each citizen a big fat check.
You have any idea how many votes that'll buy me?
-Enough to be the next governor?
-Exactly.
You're fine, Yogi.
It's just a few scrapes and bruises.
I don't know, Mr. Ranger.
I'm pretty sure I heard my spine snap.
Well, you wouldn't be able to stand.
And you wouldn't be able to eat.
I'm okay!
Yogi, Boo Boo, I would like to introduce you to Rachel Johnson who's here to make a nature documentary.
What the heck was that?
I was saying hello.
I lived in a den with brown bears for six months.
Only bear I've ever lived with is Boo Boo.
And he only makes that sound after he's eaten baked beans.
Heh, heh.
I have problems with baked beans.
And for a little bear, he makes a lot of stink.
Okay, I have some fantastic river otters you can film instead.
-Could get a hat and tie on the slow one.
-No, you know, I really, really like these two.
-Would you guys mind if I shoot you?
-Huh?
Yogi, I think she meant with a camera.
Yes.
Of course with a camera.
Heh-heh-heh.
I knew that.
But not just any camera.
This isn't gonna make me look fat, is it?
No, you are gonna look great.
Okay, just a few more adjustments.
Please, excuse the pre-tied bow tie.
My mornings are often rushed.
It's fine, Boo Boo.
This is going to be a whole new perspective for a documentary.
The Boo Boo cam will capture the true wilderness in all its natural glory.
No other human in sight.
That sounds like my apartment.
Ha, ha.
Uh, you know, because I live alone.
Well, plenty of women have tried to change that.
It's just, I haven't found one that--
-Likes you?
-What?
No.
No, that--
Will return your calls?
Can you stop helping, please?
Sir, I can see you like this lady.
But your courting rituals need work.
What you need to do is follow her around for two days making snorting sounds.
Then fight any male that looks at her.
And then, of course, urinate on her to mark her as your territory.
Works every time.
I got it under control, Yogi.
-Boo Boo, you're rolling.
-Cool.
Yogi Bear, a brown bear commonly found in North America and Alaska.
Weighing up to 1800 pounds, brown bears are also the national animal of Finland.
I don't think you have to narrate.
But I liked where you were going with it, Boo Boo.
-I was hooked.
-Really?
Yes.
Now try to film from flattering angles, if you know what I mean.
Pic-a-nic baskets may be delicious on the lips, but they're a lifetime on the hips.
Oh, no.
Ranger Smith!
Ranger Smith.
The mayor's here.
What's he doing here?
Why didn't he give us more warning?
I have to secure the area.
All units, lock down the park.
Repeat, lock down the park.
Jones, you know I'm the only other ranger here, right?
Yeah.
-Ranger Smith, we need to talk.
-You could've just called.
Yeah, but I thought this would be more friendly.
I'm really working on my people skills.
Anyway, I am closing your park down.
-Okay.
-What?
Oh, yeah, this place just costs the city way too much money.
Jellystone hasn't made its operating budget in 10 years.
You know, it's hard to compete with all those amusement parks--
Oh, hey, you're not kidding.
Oh, have you guys been to Lincoln Log Land yet?
Oh, man, they have got a roller coaster there, it's made completely out of logs.
It's just like they rode in the pioneer days.
It's unbelievable.
Sir, Jellystone is special.
Okay?
It's turning 100 years old this very year.
Why, it's a landmark.
I would never let it be closed down.
Well, uh, you actually don't have a choice.
Have you read the city bylaws lately?
Chapter 6.
Section 73.
"Any municipal property that can't generate enough money to cover its operating budget can be rezoned for other uses."
And since Jellystone loses money every year, we're shutting it down.
Uh, sorry?
-I thought that went well.
-Yeah.
Just a second, Mr. Mayor.
Who says we can't cover our budget?
Park doesn't report earnings till next quarter.
Yeah, which is like one week away.
Come on, Smith.
You gotta be $20,000 in the hole.
We wish.
Yeah.
Try 30,562.
That's probably a couple hundred extra for the map stand.
I think it's confession time.
-I only pretended to fix it.
-Thanks, Jones.
Sounds like you're in pretty deep there, Smith.
Maybe we are.
But this is one of the Iast places families can go to be close to nature.
The world needs that.
Well, I'm not mayor of the world.
I'm mayor of this city.
And this city needs this park rezoned.
I'm sorry.
I feel awful about it.
Even though I look really good.
This is a new suit.
So, okay.
Maybe we don't have our operating budget today.
But you know what?
-A lot can happen in a week.
-All right.
Have it your way.
Take a week.
Hey, I'll even get you started.
What's the admission fee for one car again?
Four dollars.
Four dollars, huh?
Four whole dollars?
Well, that changes everything.
Oh, my goodness.
Well, I only need to come back in here like, uh, what, 10,000 more times?
In a week!
Do I have time for that?
-Impossible.
-Oh, shoot.
You want-a some-a lasagna?
You hungry, buddy?
Of course!
I'm always hungry.
I was talking to my pet turtle.
Here you go.
That better not be my beef jerky.
So, what's the big deal, Yogi?
This is the big deal, Boo Boo.
It's my masterpiece.
The Basket-Nabber 2000.
The most advanced pic-a-nic basket-stealing technology ever invented.
Wow.
Climb aboard.
This glider can steer dive, shoot rubber bands at pesky-type birds and even has an air bag.
Had an air bag.
Sorry, Yogi.
Not to worry.
We could cushion our landing with all the pic-a-nic baskets we swipe.
Now, how's that copilot seat feel?
A little wobbly, like it's not tied on very tight.
You won't feel that in the air.
Get ready to fly faster than the speed of sandwich, Boo Boo.
We're gonna break the pic-a-nic barrier.
-Yogi!
-Uh-oh.
That's not his happy voice.
Don't move.
I'm switching the glider into stealth mode.
Stealth mode?
Wow.
How are you able to--?
Oh.
Ah, Mr. Ranger, sir.
Welcome.
Can I interest you in a sody pop?
-There you go.
-When did you steal our vending machine?
I, um-
- I'm repairing it, sir.
This machine gives its sodas away for free when a bear kicks it.
Look, a camper has reported some missing fishing poles so I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say it was you.
Fishing poles?
Sir, I'm a bear.
If I wanted to catch fish, I would just use my....
Your paws, Yogi.
Isn't that kind of unsanitary?
What's that?
-What's what?
-That thing.
-What thing?
-The thing under the blanket.
-Blanket?
-The object right behind you.
Oh.
Oh, that.
Heh.
A sculpture.
I'm sculpting now.
Mostly landscapes.
And where's Boo Boo?
-France.
-What?
-That's not close by, is it?
-No.
Then he's in the bathroom.
-Excuse me.
-Wait!
Hey, this isn't the bathroom.
I'm telling you, Mr. Ranger, it's not for stealing pic-a-nic baskets.
It says "Basket-Nabber 2000" right here, Yogi.
I do regret calling it that now.
I know I'm always saying, "Stay away from the campers."
This is different.
Jellystone is in real trouble.
If I don't raise $30,000 in a week, this park's getting rezoned.
Rezoned?
What does that mean?
It means the park won't be a park anymore.
The city will use this land for something else.
So we have got to do everything we can to help save it.
Which means you have gotta stop stealing food so that campers will leave here happy.
But they do leave here happy.
Getting your food stolen by Yogi Bear is special.
People come here for that.
It's like catching a foul ball at a baseball game.
Nope.
It's like getting your food stolen at a baseball game.
Come on, Yogi.
Would it really be so hard to be a regular bear?
You know, to forage for food, to walk around on all fours to hibernate a little, or a lot.
If nature had meant for me to be a regular bear it wouldn't have given me such a good thought-cooker, sir.
I can't help it if my melon is full of smart juice.
Yogi, your melon is hurting this park.
There are repercussions to stealing people's picnic baskets.
Not in my experience, sir.
On the other hand--
Ranger Smith, mind if I borrow the 'dilla?
It's an emergency.
Somebody parked without parking decals.
Jones, I would really prefer it if you focused on just maintaining the park instead.
Let me deal with the visitors until you've had more experience.
Sorry, sir.
Guess that's just the Eagle Scout in me, you know?
Always wanting to be in control, be a leader.
Live up to this fanny pack full of merit badges.
You know that fanny pack is for first aid supplies, right?
A merit badge in first aid is the only supply I need, sir.
Right, but it might not be the only supply a hurt person needs.
You seen Rachel?
Yeah, I saw her.
She was heading up to Lookout Mountain.
She can't be far.
I'll drive.
Let's roll.
Jones.
The sprawling beauty of Jellystone Park.
A timeless stretch of wilderness untouched by man.
Oh.
Ranger Smith.
Wow, heh.
What's with the fancy outfit?
Dress greens.
I always wear dress greens in the evening.
You know, in case there's, you know--
-I don't know how to talk to girls.
-Oh.
Why do you think I spend so much time with animals?
All you have to do is scratch their backside and you've got a friend for life.
Try that with people and all of a sudden you're the weird girl on the bus that nobody wants to sit next to.
Um, uh, listen.
I was wondering, you know, if you were--
I mean, it's getting late and we could, uh-- If you want.
I mean, it's not that-
- You don't-
- It's--
You know, it's not a worry.
Don't worry.
Did you just ask me to dinner?
Yes.
I did.
Heh.
-Good, you got that, huh?
-Yes.
I just thought, well, it's getting late.
I happen to know this great place.
-Very gourmet.
-Really?
Where?
So close you won't believe it.
Wow, how did you ever find this place?
This is a four-star porch.
And fresh from the hot plate, I give you...
-...rack of Spam.
-Oh.
Wow.
Maybe "gourmet" was a bit of a stretch.
No, it actually looks wonderful.
Great.
You know, this really is a peaceful place.
It's something, isn't it?
I pretty much grew up here.
My father was a ranger when I was a kid and he turned this park into the number one tourist destination in the state.
I mean, it was a park, you know?
Like families came by the hundreds swam in the streams, hiked on the trails.
It was really something.
This is really good.
Anyway, I don't know.
Maybe it's my fault.
I spent so many years learning everything I could about the park so I'd be a better ranger.
Maybe instead, I should have come up with a gimmick to get people to come here.
You know, change the name to Extreme Jellystone.
-I think that it's perfect just the way it is.
-You do?
You're right.
Absolutely.
There's no better place on earth.
-Hey, Mr. Ranger.
-Except a place without him.
Evening, Mr. Ranger, sir.
Madame Moviemaker Lady.
And yes, I'm using the fancy tense to show you the utmost respect.
Hi.
Ha, ha.
What do you want, Yogi?
Well, I was thinking about the park's prickly predicament and I would like to do my part to help.
This is all the money I have saved.
Almost $100.
I was going to use it on myself, but I'd rather donate it to Jellystone.
Well, thank you, Yogi.
That's--
That is very sweet.
-Where does a bear get money from?
-That brown box by the parking lot.
The park donation box.
Yep.
But I want you to have it.
Consider it a gift to Jellystone.
That won't be hard.
Look, guys, I appreciate the effort.
But what this park needs is visitors and lots of them.
Well, I can help you there, sir.
Just make me a headliner.
I will rock this place.
-Kick it, Boo Boo.
-Kicking it.
I like big butts and I cannot lie You other brothers can't deny
That when a girl walks in With a itty-bitty waist
And a round thing in your face You get sprung
That's not gonna work either, Yogi.
You're right.
We need something flashier than music.
Not a problem.
I've got this water-skllng routine that will change the face of entertainment.
Got a little of everything.
Music, stunts, magic.
-And I jump over Boo Boo at the end.
-No, you don't.
-I want to try it.
-I don't care.
I hate to interrupt, but you're not gonna water-ski or dance or do anything that might disturb the campers, okay?
If what you really want to do is help save this park you will lay low, stay away from people.
Think you can do that for me?
You have my word, Mr. Ranger.
I will be seen, but not heard.
Or seen.
Fine.
Huh?
You guys done with that Spam?
-Get out of here.
-Okay.
Sheesh!
Hey.
What's this?
Seasons pass applications.
Unfortunately, not a lot of takers on those.
Fifty bucks for an entire year?
Including camping fees?
That's a bargain.
If this were a place people wanted to visit throughout the year.
Maybe Yogi was on to something.
-You said the park was turning 100, right?
-Right.
Well, a big event could really pull people in.
Yeah, you're right.
We could have, like, a moss collection day or a big squirrel chase.
-Or....
-Fireworks.
Yes.
Exactly.
Why didn't I think of that?
We could host a big centennial festival.
People always show up for fireworks.
If even half of the people buy season passes the park makes enough money to stay open.
Right.
Let's get the word out.
I think I can help with that.
That is great.
How did we pay for it?
We didn't.
It was some fast-food restaurant but I rearranged the letters right before the plane took off.
You're very cool, Rachel Johnson.
You're pretty cool yourself.
I do have my own kind of natural swagger.
Jellystone National Park, 100th year anniversary.
There'll be fireworks.
Just stay calm, Jones.
You should be patrolling in the Armadillo making park-impacting decisions, but--
-Hey, 100th year anniversary.
-Thanks.
But you're not there yet.
You still have to follow orders.
Even if those orders make you look like a giant Cheez-It.
Mr. Mayor!
Hi, Mr. Mayor.
Why is it only going halfway down again?
Doesn't make any-
- No!
Oh, okay.
Is it a double tap or do I have to press it--?
-Oh, dang it!
-I got it, sir.
Yeah.
That's exactly what I did.
Let me see one of those fliers.
"Come celebrate Jellystone's 100th anniversary with fireworks and fun."
"And receive $10 off a season pass"?
He's gonna try to make the budget selling season passes.
Yeah, ugh.
It's not a very good idea, in my opinion.
But nobody consulted me, because my job is just to maintain the park which is basically poking trash with a stick.
Yeah.
Yeah, why is a guy with your talent doing this insulting grunt work?
You should be running a park.
Yeah, but Ranger Smith says I have to pay my dues.
-Excuse me?
-What?
-He has to pay his dues?
Ha.
-Ha, ha.
Nobody pays dues anymore.
You gotta be in charge now while you still know everything.
-That's what I've been saying.
-Yeah.
Buddy, if it was up to me, you would be the head ranger of Jellystone already.
-You'd put me in charge?
-In a second.
Yes.
You know, if this centennial festival didn't work out, I probably could relocate Smith.
You know, uh, maybe you could help me with that.
Make sure it doesn't succeed?
Wait, you mean, like, sabotage it?
No.
Oh, no, no, no.
No, I want you to be head ranger.
It just so happens that the only way to do that is to bring down this festival.
But spend the rest of your life as second-in-command if you like.
That's fine.
It's a perfectly valid life choice.
Well, you just think about it and give me a call, okay?
Here's my card.
So long.
Hey.
Now why is it doing that?
No.
Boy Scouts are loyal, thrifty, kind....
Hey, you're back.
Hey, thanks for getting those fliers out.
Let me tell you, this festival is gonna be huge.
Hey, Ranger Smith, how long do you think until I reach head ranger status?
Oh, no time at all.
I did it in 12 short years.
Ha, okay.
Are you serious?
Just be patient, Jones.
It'll be here before you know it.
This festival's gonna be great!
I can't wait 12 years.
Seasons pass order forms.
Seasons pass order forms.
Thank you.
Seasons pass order forms, $10 off today.
Ah, enjoy.
I can't take it, Boo Boo.
Two days without a tasty treat to eat?
And I have to sit up here while they're having a "happy birthday, Jellystone" party?
And they have doughnuts.
Doughnuts!
Yogi, what are you doing?
-Yogi!
-I'm going.
Hey.
Wait.
Don't do it, Yogi.
You promised Mr. Ranger.
You're right.
I'm losing control, Boo Boo.
I don't know who's steering the ship.
Here.
I want you to handcuff me to this tree and not unlock it no matter what I say.
Okay, Yogi.
-Okay, unlock me.
-Huh?
It was a bad idea.
Unlock me.
Unlock me!
Okay.
Here you go.
Folks, I hate to say this, but there are no spots left.
Forecast called for thunderstorms.
Severe lightning.
I fear for your young ones.
We're out of fireworks, I'm afraid.
It's just sparklers left.
Oh, no.
You look nice.
Your napkin matches your tie.
I don't need you to kiss up to me.
Got this guy for that.
That's a good point, sir.
You were gonna handle this situation, yet there are quite a few people here.
Sir, I tried.
All last night I spent taking down fliers.
I blocked the entrance with a vehicle to back up traffic.
I hung up "rabid squirrel" signs everywhere.
Those were hand-drawn.
-Nothing is working.
-You need to think of something, don't you?
Or maybe you're just not head ranger material.
Mr. Mayor.
Mayor's yes man.
So glad you could join us.
I saved you a nice spot next to the porta-potties.
Oh, well, thank you.
Well, that's very thoughtful.
You know, I'm just so glad that these festivities are going so well, Smith.
I just hope nothing goes wrong.
We are gonna pull this off, Jonesy.
I've seen hundreds of people filling out seasons pass order forms.
The weather's great.
The fireworks, ready to go.
Even Yogi's staying out of the way.
Yogi.
Hey, guys.
Sorry, just wandering around, bored out of my mind.
Bored?
But the 100th anniversary extravaganza's going on.
Yeah, more like 100th anniversary lame-aganza.
You know, because it's so lame.
People see fireworks every day in the city.
They thought they'd see something different here.
I knew it.
I should be out there doing my water-ski routine.
I'm a shining star and Ranger Smith is holding me back.
I don't know, Yogi.
Mr. Ranger is usually right about these things.
No, Boo Boo, Ranger Smith is in denial.
I mean, he's lost it, you know?
I saw him a couple days ago.
He was filling his pockets with dirt.
He said he's gonna start moving the park to his apartment piece by piece.
-How big is his apartment?
-There's still time.
I won't be able to do the half-hour artistic program but that was more for me anyway.
These people need the razzle-dazzle.
I don't think we've practiced the razzle-dazzle.
You're not supposed to, Boo Boo.
That's where it gets the razzle.
Yogi, I really don't think we should--
Boo Boo, you've tried to stop my brilliant ideas with common sense a thousand times.
Has it ever worked?
No.
Then let's go, go, go.
What does that taste like?
Unemployment?
-I'm sorry.
-Yeah.
Thanks again for helping with the fireworks.
I don't know where Jones disappeared to.
My pleasure.
You know, um, Rachel, I've been wanting to tell you...
-...well, how much I--
-Ranger--
No, please, let me get through this.
I'm not very good with words.
But I have never felt so gushy.
Ha-ha-ha.
-You know?
-Ranger--
You know what I did?
I went and I wrote a song about you.
It's like this:
Oh, no.
I saw you at the station
Had a heart palpitation
My sickness was love And you're the medication
Rachel
-Rachel
-The microphone is on.
And it comes around again
Rachel, Rachel, Rachel
The microphone is on.
Yes, the mic--
Hi.
Hello and welcome to the 100th anniversary of Jellystone!
Thank you.
It is so wonderful to see so many people here today.
I've noticed many of you filling out your seasons pass order forms.
We're more than happy to collect those after the fireworks.
But first, please, sit back, get comfortable and enjoy the show!
-Terrific.
-Mr.
Mayor?
That's not the right music.
I'll take it from here, Mr. Ranger!
Oh, no.
Full speed ahead, Boo Boo.
Okay.
Not bad, eh, Boo Boo?
Looking good, Yogi.
-This cannot be happening.
-Oh, it's happening.
Hello, Jellystone!
No, don't encourage him!
They love me.
I can do no wrong.
Watch this.
All right, Boo Boo!
Turn up the heat!
Phase two, go.
I'm an unstoppable water-skllng machine.
Ta-da!
Oh, wait.
There's more.
How about if I heat things up?
Don't need nothin' but a good time
And it don't get better than this
Yogi!
Yogi, your cape.
I know.
It is magnificent.
And on fire.
Huh?
Fire!
-Turn the boat!
-Huh?
-Turn, Boo Boo!
-Hang on, Yogi!
Too much razzle!
-Nice one.
-Thanks.
Jump!
Let's go.
Out of my way!
This could not have gone more perfectly.
Hey, you got a little, uh....
Never mind.
Let's go.
Mr. Ranger, I thought--
Yogi, that's the problem.
All the thinking.
Hey, you know what would be great?
If you didn't think.
If you could just be a regular bear.
You know, sitting in the woods, minding his own business.
But no, you're different.
You're smart.
And you'd rather spend your days being selfish and destructive while everyone else pays the price.
But I guess it wasn't enough, screwing up my life.
No, this time you had to go and bring down this entire park.
So tell me, Yogi how smart are you now?
Hey, there!
That was quite a show you put on yesterday.
Ha-ha-ha.
I can't wait to see what you do with this.
That's your new assignment.
Evergreen Park.
Oh, I think you're just going to find it delightful.
Oh, and, uh, Ranger Jones is gonna be taking over here.
Ranger Jones?
Well, I have got a press conference to plan.
You see, it turns out I've saved the city.
Don't forget to vote, my friend.
Brown for governor!
Ha-ha-ha.
He's not gonna vote for me, is he?
Uh, no.
You did everything you could.
Doesn't matter.
This park needed a ranger who could make it popular again.
I'm just some guy who knows how old every tree is.
Fat lot of good that did Jellystone.
Face it.
You and I are just two people who care about things that nobody else does and that's why we're alone.
Or maybe that's why we found each other.
Did you ever think of that?
Rachel, you and this park have one thing in common.
You both deserve a better man than me.
I can't believe he's really gone.
Yogi, are you okay?
I'm done being special, Boo Boo.
Ranger Smith was right.
My whole life, I've been different.
But it's done nothing but hurt people.
The world would be better off if I was only as smart as the average bear.
Yogi, what are you doing?
I'm leaving, Boo Boo.
-I am going to forage for food in the wild.
-Huh?
Might even catch some fish.
With my paws.
I'm just gonna grab a little something for the road.
Some chips and soda.
And this.
Peach pie.
Any more of that casserole?
Top shelf.
I'll be out there.
Fending for myself.
Foraging for food in the wild.
Goodbye, horsepower limiter.
There's a new head ranger in town.
Let's see what you got.
Perfect.
I'm sorry, Ranger Smith.
No more food.
No more pic-a-nickers.
How could this get any worse?
Oh.
Ah, Evergreen Park.
Yes, it is simply delightful.
-Come on.
-I've got it, sir.
This is unbelievable.
Ah, Evergreen Park.
Lovely, isn't it?
This isn't a park.
I can barely breathe in here.
Look at these trees.
They're all plastic.
Oh, no, they're real.
It's just years of smog and pollution have left a plastic-like coating on them.
Think people will be happy you're closing the most beautiful park in the state?
Well, they will be when they find out it's making the city rich and giving each citizen a check for $1000.
How is that even possible?
Oh, well, it turns out that there has been some agricultural interest in the park.
And it's a lot more profitable than people in station wagons making s'mores.
Have a good day, Ranger Smith.
I hate this car.
I hate it.
Yeah!
Oh, hey, there he is.
Ha-ha-ha.
Whoa, hey, Mr. Mayor!
I, uh....
Just finishing some stamping.
You are doing great, Jones.
I knew you were the guy for this job.
Quick thing.
You'll probably notice some giant trucks rumbling by.
We're just clearing a little patch of trees for my press conference.
No big deal.
Um, wait, you're cutting down trees?
Oh, yeah.
Well, just a few.
It's nothing to worry about.
Actually gonna improve the park quite a bit.
I'll bet one of the first things you noticed as head ranger is that you need more clear spaces here, and you are absolutely right.
Now you can host concerts and Boy Scout jamborees.
That's a pretty smart move there, Head Ranger Jones.
I have some other park improvements I want to run by you.
Oh, splendid, yes.
I think I have a few moments to hear those.
Look into the security arrangements for tomorrow.
I don't want any surprises.
I'll hear what Ding-Dong has to say.
What do you got?
I'm hungrier than the average bear.
I wish I could find a bush that tasted like birthday cake.
Gotcha.
Pretend it's a gummy worm.
Pretend it's a gummy worm.
Yogi, I've been looking everywhere for you.
Not now, Boo Boo.
I'm busy foraging.
Come on, Yogi.
Jellystone is in trouble.
We need your help.
Nothing I can do, Boo Boo.
I'm average now.
My brain is out of business.
I wouldn't even be standing if my paws didn't hurt.
Quit feeling sorry for yourself.
You know you're not an average bear.
Hey, hey, Boo Boo.
You're right, I'm not.
I failed at that too.
Hey, come back here.
You've gotta save Jellystone.
What are you doing?
I'm not--
Yogi, you have to use your smarts for good.
And if you can't see that, maybe you are just an average bear.
Come on.
Now do you understand?
What's going on, Boo Boo?
I don't know.
But whatever it is I think they're just getting started.
Boo Boo get my collar.
Nobody is gonna hurt Jellystone.
Where are we going, Yogi?
We can't get Jellystone back alone, Boo Boo.
My thinker is good, but Ranger Smith's is better.
He was going to a place called Evergreen Park.
That's right.
In the city.
The city?
That's a long walk.
Don't be silly, Boo Boo.
I've already got a smarty-smart cheat to keep our feet off the street.
Get ready for it.
Here it comes.
Run, Boo Boo, run!
Hurry, Boo Boo.
I think we gotta jump for it.
Ready?
All aboard.
Good.
Yogi, grab my paw.
Sorry.
Boo Boo, Boo Boo, Boo Boo!
I gotta get--!
I guess it makes a stop here.
Yup.
Looks like Evergreen Park is about two miles away from here.
Two miles?
I'll have to tap into my emergency rations.
Snack break.
Come on, Yogi.
We need to keep moving.
It's not that far and it's all downhill.
Downhill?
Excuse me, Mr. Dirty Shopper.
Any chance my friend and I might borrow your wheely-basket?
Is that chocolate?
Okay, Boo Boo, keep it steady.
I'm okay, Ma.
Just--
Yeah, no, it's not Jellystone, but at least there's nothing here to drive me crazy.
-Hey, Mr. Ranger.
-Hey, Yogi.
All right, Ma, I gotta call you back.
What are you guys doing here?
We need your help, Mr. Ranger, sir.
But don't worry, my days of goofing things up for you are over.
Hey, move that shopping cart!
I'm okay!
I'm just gonna put this over here.
What do you want?
I don't have a life left for you to ruin anymore.
Sir, I know I messed things up and I'm sorry.
I never meant to.
You and Boo Boo are the best friends I ever had.
And I've never done anything but think of myself.
And now Jellystone is just gonna be a big field of stumps.
What?
They've started cutting down the trees.
"Agricultural interest" is logging.
Oh, no, not our Jellystone.
We have to save it, sir.
I don't think we can save it, Yogi.
I'm no smarter than you.
I lost Jellystone.
I lost Rachel.
It's over.
Mr. Ranger, I've learned two things from stealing pic-a-nic baskets.
One:
light mayonnaise is not nearly as good as regular mayonnaise.
And two: you can't fail if you never stop trying.
You have to fight for the things you love whether it's a park, a girl or a roast beef sandwich.
Don't give up now.
We're all Jellystone's got.
You're right, Yogi.
Jellystone's too important to give up on.
We gotta try.
Come on.
-Shotgun.
-Aw.
I never thought I'd see this.
Happy 100th anniversary, Jellystone.
Isn't that Miss Movie Lady?
I gotta get in there.
You don't understand.
Let me in, please.
No can do.
Park is closed to the public until the press conference.
Mayor's orders.
Then go talk to him.
Tell him what I told you.
I'm sorry.
I don't really take orders from a--
I lived with gorillas, pal.
I know rage.
You do not want me to go gorilla on you.
Uh, I'll speak to the mayor.
-Thank you.
-Okay.
Rachel.
Ranger Smith.
I didn't think I'd ever see you again.
I know.
I don't know what I was thinking.
I think you're perfect.
I think any guy in the world would be lucky just to stand next to you.
You really mean that?
Of course I do.
It's just, when I lost Jellystone, I felt like such a failure.
But losing you has felt much, much worse.
I'm like....
I'm like a genus without a phylum.
That's the sweetest thing anyone's ever said to me.
-So, um, we're still here.
-Mm-hm.
Oh, right.
Ahem.
So, what are you doing here?
-Come on, I'll show you.
-Okay.
I was reviewing the documentary footage from Boo Boo's camera and I saw this.
Oh, my.
I see it.
I have a bald spot back there!
I'm not talking about you, Yogi.
I'm talking about this.
Yeah, it's my pet turtle.
He hangs out at the cave all the time.
True.
You know they don't come out of that shell?
I tried one time to see what one would look like without it.
But, nope, they're sewn in.
This is no regular turtle.
See the bulging frog-like eyes and the really wide mouth?
A frog-mouthed turtle?
Yup, Rafetus swinhoei.
But those are extinct.
For a hundred years, but apparently one still exists.
And he lives in there.
But they won't let me through the gates to go find him.
But if Jellystone has an endangered species living in it, then--
It has to be protected as a park.
That's the law.
That turtle can save this park.
Now I feel kinda bad about using him as a foot stool.
You've seen the filmmaker?
Well, we spoke.
About extinct turtles.
You're telling me there is an extinct turtle living here in the park?
According to Miss Johnson's film, there is.
An extinct turtle?
That's great.
Visitors will come from miles around to see an endangered species.
Yes, they will, and that is great.
We need to find this turtle.
Just to keep it safe.
Have a vet check it out.
The whole deal.
The sooner we get to him the better.
Oh, we need a head ranger who's good enough to find it.
Someone who thinks like a turtle.
I am that head ranger.
Well, then why are you still here?
He's back.
Come on.
You need to let us in this park.
That turtle needs protection.
Don't worry about the turtle.
We're handling it.
We'll make sure he's put in a nice zoo.
No.
A turtle that's endangered can't be removed from its natural habitat.
It's against federal law.
It is?
Wow, I've never heard of that law in chapter 4, subsection 6 of the Wildlife Protection Mandate.
Don't worry, Mr. Ranger, sir.
That turtle is safe.
These people have no idea where my cave is.
The turtle's in the talking bear's cave.
Copy.
Wow, that backfired.
Okay.
You know what?
Fine,
You win.
What are you doing?
I have a plan.
One of the advantages of having lived here since I was a kid is I know this park like the back of my hand.
Let's go!
Hold on, boys.
All right.
Hey, there, little buddy.
Hello, there.
Uh-oh.
Sorry about that.
-Mayor Brown.
-This had better be good, Jones.
I found the turtle.
He was in Boo Boo's sleeping bag.
But now I have him secure at the picnic area.
Jones, you're a hero.
Sit tight.
My chief of staff is on his way to get him.
Copy that.
Head Ranger Jones over and out.
He found the turtle.
Dang it.
Can't cross those rapids.
There's no way to get to him from here.
Well, there is one way.
There it is.
My masterpiece.
-You really think you can pull this off?
-I know I can, sir.
I'm gonna snatch that basket-type turtle box and fly away like a fuzzy bird.
And I've got the best copilot a basket-snatching machine could have.
-I don't know how to fly this thing.
-Well, you'll pick it up as we go.
Okay.
Look, just be careful, okay, Yogi?
Copy that, ground control.
Basket-Nabber 2000 ready for takeoff.
-Flight systems check.
Boo Boo?
-What?
-Can you reach the pedals?
-If I point my toes.
Flight systems are go.
Remember what I told you about flying gliders, Yogi.
Don't fight the wind.
As long as the wind wants me to snatch up that turtle, we'll get along just fine.
-All right.
-Start pedaling, Boo Boo.
All right.
Here goes.
Hold on, Boo Boo.
Fasten your seat belt.
But there isn't one.
-Here we go!
-Oh, Yogi!
The wind should carry you south!
We'll meet you there!
Take your time, Mr. Ranger.
This machine is equipped with landing gear.
We'll touch down as soft as a feather.
Whoops.
This is your captain speaking.
We'll reach our turtle target in about two minutes.
So let's go ahead and start the beverage service.
-Yogi, look out.
-Aah!
-Trees!
-Yes, trees!
I got it.
I got it.
I got it.
I don't got it!
BOO BOO:
Pull up.
-Hey!
-Pull up!
You did it, Yogi.
Oh.
Yeah.
Ha-ha-ha.
Great job, Jones.
I'll get this guy to the city zoo.
-The city zoo?
-Yep.
They got a nice spot ready in the reptile house.
The city zoo doesn't have a reptile house.
They're building one.
-Who is?
-Builders.
Sure you're trying to protect the turtle?
Yeah, we love turtles.
Then you won't mind if I hold onto him until I notify the Wildlife Federation, right?
All right.
You're gonna find this out in a few hours anyway, so I might as well tell you.
We gotta lose this turtle to sell logging rights to the park.
Logging?
The whole park?
Yeah, but who cares?
It's still a park, just without trees.
And they'll grow back.
Yeah, in like 200 years.
It doesn't matter.
Your career is what matters.
Ha-ha-ha.
Turtle target acquired.
I need 20 more feet of altitude.
Engage the hand pedals.
You couldn't put the hand pedals by you?
There's a suggestion box behind the seat, Boo Boo.
Wait, you don't want to approach him like that.
He's poisonous.
He's in a basket.
But he can spit.
Poison.
He'll aim at your eyes.
Melt them out of your head.
-I'm telling you, that turtle is deadly.
-What are you looking at?
-Hook me in, Boo Boo.
-Okay.
And fire!
Here you go.
Huh?
Yogi, wait!
Here I come!
He's going for the turtle.
-Mind if I borrow this?
-Hey!
Look, Boo Boo!
We got the turtle!
Hey, why aren't you in your seat?
That bear knows how to steal a basket.
Everybody after that glider now!
I'm not gonna let a bear make me look bad.
Been there, buddy.
We're drifting too far right.
I wanna get us outside the park.
Don't fight the wind, Yogi.
Remember what Miss Movie Lady said about--
Never mind.
-Hang on, Boo Boo.
-What do we do now?
Did you check the safety manual?
It's just a picture of us screaming.
We've got to deject, Boo.
Don't you mean eject?
Eject is up.
Deject is down.
In case of emergency your seat can also be used as a flotation device!
Hey, told you.
Nothing to worry about.
I actually think I wasn't worried enough.
Let me see how our little passenger is doing.
Wonder why they call him a frog-mouthed turtle anyway?
Hey!
Hey, guys, over here!
Yogi, grab the branch.
Got you, Mr. Ranger, sir.
-Welcome aboard.
-Yogi.
We were trying to get you off the raft.
Yeah, that makes more sense.
You guys did it.
You saved him.
Oh, no.
They're gonna catch us downstream.
I'm on it.
No, Yogi, don't.
Problem solved.
They can't catch us now.
Yeah, because now we are headed straight for the Jellyjarring Rapids.
-Grab a paddle.
-Tuck your head in, little buddy.
Brace yourselves.
Oh, come on, turtle.
Don't worry, I put safety belts in this raft for just such an occasion.
You better hang on.
Mr. Ranger said--
We're gonna be fine, Boo Boo.
Just sit back and let Mother Nature carry us to--
I think Mother Nature's kind of cranky today.
You okay, Yogi?
Fine!
Turtle!
Who's that?
I can't see.
Come here, turtle.
-Got him.
-Good work, Boo Boo.
We made it through the rapids.
Yeah, but that means the falls are just up ahead.
Hold on!
Yogi.
Yogi.
Now who says there are no rides at Jellystone?
Yeah, you've definitely got the thrill part down.
Please, take your seats.
The press conference is about to begin.
That's over a mile away.
We're never gonna make that in time.
-Ranger Jones?
-I messed up pretty bad, sir.
-I know.
It's okay.
-I wanted to be head ranger.
Because you're a good head ranger and I value leadership.
I have a merit badge--
Can we talk later?
We're pressed for time.
Yes.
Get in.
Boo Boo!
Boo Boo!
Wait up!
Well, well.
Guess who we found.
Starts with T and ends with a-- "Urtle"?
It's over.
Call off the logging.
The law says this park is now a protected nature preserve.
You think I care about what the law says?
Or about some endangered "frog-mouthed turtle"?
Or some stupid park for families to have a picnic in?
I care about power, you pinheads!
And I'm gonna get it.
Nobody knows this turtle exists.
And nobody ever will.
You found the turtle.
Get this thing out of here before anybody else sees it.
-Rachel!
-Oh!
Yogi!
BOO BOO:
Yogi, here!
Thank you.
-Yogi.
-I'm sorry.
He was open.
Ha, ha.
Now if you'll excuse me, I have a press conference.
I can still tell them what you did.
Oh, yeah?
Without that turtle or a scrap of evidence, go right ahead.
Well, you might as well tell them Bigfoot is here.
Ha-ha-ha.
And do yourself a favor, there, ranger.
Try to keep your dignity.
It's all you have left.
You know what?
I'm taking care of this thing myself this time.
That's the only way to make sure the job is done right.
But that's why I'm the mayor's right-hand man, right?
Because I don't make mistakes.
Hey, you know, people are wondering:
"Why should I vote for Mayor Brown to be governor?"
Well, how about this:
Mayor Brown just turned the city's budget from a deficit into a surplus!
And put $1000 into the pocket of every citizen of this city!
Now before I sign the paperwork that will save the city why don't you all take a look at my first campaign ad for governor?
Mayor Brown, the right choice for governor.
We're out of time.
Must be something we can do.
Anybody have any ideas?
Well, I guess this is going to be a pretty sad documentary, huh?
Are you--?
Is he still filming?
I needed more footage, so I told him to keep it rolling.
I can plug that into the video feed right up there.
I just need a way to distract the guards.
I think we can take care of that.
He supports public safety.
All right, hurry up, people.
Focus.
Let's go save those orphans.
Hey, hey, hey, check this out!
-Kick it, Boo Boo.
-Kicking it.
Don't stop believing
Hold on to that feeling
He's tough on crime.
Hey, hey, hey, look at this.
Keep your eye on the little bear.
Look at the skills.
Amazing!
And here's what Mayor Brown proudly has to say about protecting our natural resources.
You think I care about what the law says?
Or about some endangered "frog-mouthed turtle"?
-Some stupid park for families to picnic in?
-No.
No.
No.
I care about power, you pinheads!
Oh, boy.
Nobody knows this turtle exists.
And nobody ever will.
There's about to be a riot out there.
I need you out front.
Okay.
No.
Hey, wait.
Wait, wait, wait.
Please, please, please.
That was not real.
Trust me, there is no such thing as a frog-mouthed turtle.
He's right next to me, isn't he?
Okay.
-We did it, Yogi!
-Up high, Boo Boo!
-All right!
-We got it!
Yogi!
All right, and now....
Miss Moviemaker Lady.
Hey, we did it.
Hey, Mr. Ranger!
-Come on, Boo Boo.
-Okay.
I was wrong, Yogi.
I say from here on, we just be proud of who we are and fight for the things we're passionate about, like this park.
And Rachel.
And pic-a-nic baskets?
And pic-a-nic baskets.
-Aw, come here!
-No, you don't have to--
Okay.
All right, that's--
I'm good.
Here you go, Boo Boo.
Take good care of him.
Hey, there, buddy.
No, no, no, I never took a kickback on anything in my entire career.
No one loves turtles more than I do.
And nature in general.
I love trees.
Oh, no, you don't!
Gorilla?
Himalayan snow leopard.
Huh.
Welcome to Jellystone, home of the frog-mouthed turtle.
And brochures.
I'm Ranger Jones.
Ah, yes, Jellystone Park.
A wonderful little piece of paradise.
Where families come and soak up the tranquility of nature.
It's a place that--
Huh?
Never mind.
Hey, hey, hey!
Hi.
Welcome.
Well, I am certainly glad that you are gonna be staying in Jellystone for a while.
And what animal will you be observing?
Well, I thought I would observe the courting rituals of the American ranger.
I happen to hear the American ranger is a very charming intelligent, attractive species.
One that always keeps his cool.
Even when basket-stealing bears push his buttons?
Listen, Yogi will be Yogi.
And I'm just not gonna let it bother me anymore.
Besides I have more important things to focus on.
Oh....
I....
Let's-
- Let's try that again.
Afternoon, Mr. Ranger, sir!
Hi, Miss Movie Lady!
Yogi!
I love this place.
Yogi!
Hey!
srt English Subtitles Dan4Jem, ADMMXI
NARRATOR:
Jelly stone Park.
One of the nation's oldest and most beautiful stretches of wilderness.
For years, families have headed out from the busy city eager to enjoy a little camping, fishing and, of course, observing the park's natural wildlife.
Boo Boo, I think it's time I introduced myself to that pic-a-nic basket.
You know, Yogi, we could just hunt for food.
All the other animals do.
Boo Boo, a pic-a-nic basket has everything a bear needs.
And I'm not just talking about the treats and snack-type goodies.
No.
A pic-a-nic basket holds a lot more than that.
It holds dreams.
What are we looking at?
I don't know.
Hook me in.
{IN NORMAL VOICE} You sure it'll work, Yogi?
Well, you know, Boo Boo, I'm smarter than the average bear!
All right!
MAN:
Ranger Smith!
Sorry about that.
We got a 4-23 in Redwood Valley, sir.
- A what?
- A bear disturbance.
- I think it's probably...
- I know who it is.
Why didn't you just say "bear disturbance"?
Well, I...
Uh, well, it sounds cooler.
I mean, we're park rangers, sir.
You know:
"To protect and preserve."
Did you just make that motto up?
Yeah, I did.
Do you like it?
Ranger Jones, you know that, well, being a park ranger, it's not about mottos.
It's about keeping the park safe.
That's where the glory is.
Protecting all of this.
Yeah, I know.
Besides, that motto was still in the testing phase.
It's not like I made T-shirts or anything.
Heh, no, of course not.
Okay, I'm goanna deal with that 4-23.
Okay, copy that, sir.
Um, I'm actually goanna hop in the Armadillo, make some rounds.
Jones, you know that the Armadillo is for head ranger use only.
I might need it at any moment to deal with a park emergency.
Why don't you finish stacking those trail maps?
Yeah, sure.
Okay.
Yeah, because that's what future head rangers do, they stack maps.
Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy!
Our days of getting banged up to grab a meal are over, Boo Boo.
From now on, the pic-a-nic baskets are going to fall into our arms.
Soldering iron.
BOO BOO:
Here you go.
- Thank you.
Okay.
That should do it.
Test rock.
Okay, Yogi.
YOGI:
Weight sensor triggered.
Basket in position.
Launch spring starts coiling.
Firing pin drops.
And... {BELL RINGS}
Bull's-eye!
I'm so smart it hurts!
You're standing on the soldering iron.
Or it's that.
Hot, hot, hot!
There's the test rock.
Now we just wait here for a pic-a-nic basket to fall into our arms.
Are you sure about this, Yogi?
People seem to get pretty mad when you...
A genius never questions his instincts, Boo Boo.
When you have a mind like mine you can't blink or you'll put a kink in your think.
Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.
We've got our first customers.
And they have pie!
I wonder what kind it is.
SMITH:
Yogi, are you out here?
- It's Mr. Ranger.
- Aah!
Get rid of the test rock.
Destroy the evidence.
I was never here.
SMITH:
Look...
Ow!
Hello, Mr. Ranger, sir.
Did you just...?
Did you guys...?
Did you...?
Oh, never mind.
Look, there was a complaint about a bear interfering with a family picnic.
I see.
And you'd like us to mount some sort of investigation?
No, I think it was you.
What?
!
How can you even think that?
Are you feverish?
Let me press my lips against your forehead.
Wait!
You're not pressing your lips against my forehead.
Hey, it's a lot better than the way they take my temperature.
No, look, Yogi, we've been over this many times.
Bears are supposed to avoid people, not run around stealing their food.
I agree, sir.
That's why my friend Boo Boo and I would never think of disturbing a family's pic-a-nic.
{BELL RINGS AND WOOD CLUNKS}
{WOMAN SCREAMS}
Huh.
It missed.
Good day, Mr. Ranger, sir.
We'll keep our eyes peeled.
I wonder if he noticed the pie.
JONES {CHOPPY OVER RADIO}:
Ra...
Smith.
You have a vis...
Over.
Didn't understand a word of that, Jones.
- Sorry.
Some lady's here to see you.
- Send her in.
- Okay.
I'll be in the Armadillo.
- Or you could be...
- Map stacking?
- Map stacking.
- Ranger Smith?
- Yes.
- Hello.
I'm Rachel Johnson.
- Hi.
I was hoping to talk to you about filming a documentary here.
Sure.
I can handle you for that.
Handle that for you.
Sorry.
My work isn't...
My brain isn't working right.
- I must have inhaled some jimsonweed.
- Oh.
Datura stramonium.
It's known to cause delirium cramping and nausea.
Heh.
- Cramping and nausea.
You've read The North American Wilderness Guide.
Yeah, I like to highlight all the plants and animals I see.
- I like to...
Me too.
- Ha, ha!
Yeah.
{SMITH STAMMERING}
Ranger Smith.
At your service.
You want to film a documentary in Jelly stone?
Yes.
I sent you a letter about a month ago.
- Written on a piece of bark.
- That was you!
Yes.
I'm sorry about that.
I was in Sumatra, living among the orangutans at the time and they get very nervous if they spot anything from the modern world.
Really?
Wow, that's amazing.
Then what did you use for ink?
Bird poop and spit.
Impressive.
So, what are you here to film?
Well, I was hoping to shoot a local species.
Something to really capture the beauty of a national park.
Terrific.
What animal were you thinking?
I heard you had an unusual brown bear.
- Brown bear?
- Yes.
One that talks?
Those are so rare.
- None that I can think of.
- Named Yogi?
Wears a hat and a tie?
No, that doesn't ring a bell.
I think he's standing on the roof, trying to steal your lunchbox.
YOGI:
I smell PB and J.
{YOGI SHOUTING}
I'm all done.
Oh, right.
That Yogi.
Bankrupt?
No, no, no.
We're a city.
Cities don't go bankrupt.
They do when they're broke, sir.
We just have to find some money somewhere.
I'm about to run for governor.
How am I goanna do that when my own city is bankrupt?
Okay, yes.
Thank you.
- Here's the invoice, Mr. Mayor.
- Yikes!
Wow.
Ha.
I'm goanna pretend I didn't see that.
Just bill it to the city, okay?
Thank you.
Ugh.
How did we ever go so broke?
- I think we just spent too much.
- Hmm.
Is there anything we can sell?
You already sold the public golf course to condo developers two of the three fire stations to that frozen yogurt company.
You were selling the library, but it burned down.
Oh, yeah.
That was goanna be one of those make-your-own-doughnut places.
- No.
- Yeah.
- If you could dream it up, you could make it.
- Ah.
Love those.
We got to think of something here.
Well, if we don't have anything to sell, maybe we can profit off what we can't sell.
I don't understand those words.
Like when we sold the bottling rights to the water in Lake Beuclair.
- We made a fortune.
- Yeah.
Sinkhole Beuclair is a great place to throw old mattresses.
- Oh, yeah.
- Hmm.
We just don't have any more resources to exploit.
Or do we?
Jelly stone.
If we rezone Jelly stone Park as agricultural land, we can sell the logging rights.
Here.
This company says they'll give us thousands of dollars an acre just to cut down the trees or something.
That'll be enough to balance the budget and give each citizen a big fat check.
You have any idea how many votes that'll buy me?
- Enough to be the next governor?
- Exactly.
You're fine, Yogi.
It's just a few scrapes and bruises.
I don't know, Mr. Ranger.
I'm pretty sure I heard my spine snap.
Well, you wouldn't be able to stand.
And you wouldn't be able to eat.
I'm okay!
Yogi, Boo Boo, I would like to introduce you to Rachel Johnson who's here to make a nature documentary.
What the heck was that?
I was saying hello.
I lived in a den with brown bears for six months.
Only bear I've ever lived with is Boo Boo.
And he only makes that sound after he's eaten baked beans.
Heh, heh.
I have problems with baked beans.
And for a little bear, he makes a lot of stink.
Okay, I have some fantastic river otters you can film instead.
- Could get a hat and tie on the slow one.
- No, you know, I really, really like these two.
- Would you guys mind if I shoot you?
YOGI:
Huh?
{RAPID FOOTSTEPS}
Yogi, I think she meant with a camera.
Yes.
Of course with a camera.
Heh-heh-heh.
I knew that.
But not just any camera.
This isn't goanna make me look fat, is it?
RACHEL:
No, you are goanna look great.
Okay, just a few more adjustments.
Please, excuse the pre-tied bow tie.
My mornings are often rushed.
It's fine, Boo Boo.
This is going to be a whole new perspective for a documentary.
The Boo Boo cam will capture the true wilderness in all its natural glory.
No other human in sight.
That sounds like my apartment.
Ha, ha.
Uh, you know, because I live alone.
Well, plenty of women have tried to change that.
It's just, I haven't found one that...
- Likes you?
- What?
No.
No, that...
Will return your calls?
Can you stop helping, please?
Sir, I can see you like this lady.
But your courting rituals need work.
What you need to do is follow her around for two days making snorting sounds.
Then fight any male that looks at her.
And then, of course, urinate on her to mark her as your territory.
Works every time.
I got it under control, Yogi.
- Boo Boo, you're rolling.
- Cool.
Yogi Bear, a brown bear commonly found in North America and Alaska.
Weighing up to 1800 pounds, brown bears are also the national animal of Finland.
I don't think you have to narrate.
But I liked where you were going with it, Boo Boo.
- I was hooked.
- Really?
Yes.
Now try to film from flattering angles, if you know what I mean.
Pic-a-nic baskets may be delicious on the lips, but they're a lifetime on the hips.
Oh, no.
Ranger Smith!
Ranger Smith.
The mayor's here.
What's he doing here?
Why didn't he give us more warning?
I have to secure the area.
All units, lock down the park.
Repeat, lock down the park.
Jones, you know I'm the only other ranger here, right?
Yeah.
- Ranger Smith, we need to talk.
- You could've just called.
BROWN:
Yeah, but I thought this would be more friendly.
I'm really working on my people skills.
Anyway, I am closing your park down.
- Okay.
- What?
Oh, yeah, this place just costs the city way too much money.
Jelly stone hasn't made its operating budget in 10 years.
You know, it's hard to compete with all those amusement parks...
Oh, hey, you're not kidding.
Oh, have you guys been to Lincoln Log Land yet?
Oh, man, they have got a roller coaster there, it's made completely out of logs.
It's just like they rode in the pioneer days.
It's unbelievable.
Sir, Jelly stone is special.
Okay?
It's turning 100 years old this very year.
Why, it's a landmark.
I would never let it be closed down.
Well, uh, you actually don't have a choice.
Have you read the city bylaws lately?
Chapter 6.
Section 73.
"Any municipal property that can't generate enough money to cover its operating budget can be rezoned for other uses."
And since Jelly stone loses money every year, we're shutting it down.
Uh, sorry?
{BOTH CHUCKLE}
- I thought that went well.
CHIEF:
Yeah.
SMITH:
Just a second, Mr. Mayor.
Who says we can't cover our budget?
Park doesn't report earnings till next quarter.
Yeah, which is like one week away.
Come on, Smith.
You got to be $20,000 in the hole.
We wish.
Yeah.
Try 30,562.
That's probably a couple hundred extra for the map stand.
I think it's confession time.
- I only pretended to fix it.
- Thanks, Jones.
Sounds like you're in pretty deep there, Smith.
Maybe we are.
But this is one of the last places families can go to be close to nature.
The world needs that.
Well, I'm not mayor of the world.
I'm mayor of this city.
And this city needs this park rezoned.
I'm sorry.
I feel awful about it.
Even though I look really good.
This is a new suit.
So, okay.
Maybe we don't have our operating budget today.
But you know what?
- A lot can happen in a week.
- All right.
Have it your way.
Take a week.
Hey, I'll even get you started.
What's the admission fee for one car again?
Four dollars.
Four dollars, huh?
Four whole dollars?
Well, that changes everything.
Oh, my goodness.
Well, I only need to come back in here like, uh, what, 10,000 more times?
In a week!
Do I have time for that?
- Impossible.
- Oh, shoot.
{WEIRD AL YANKOVIC'S "LASAGNA" PLAYING ON STEREO}
You want-a some-a lasagne?
You hungry, buddy?
Of course!
I'm always hungry.
I was talking to my pet turtle.
Here you go.
That better not be my beef jerky.
{TURTLE CHEWING}
So, what's the big deal, Yogi?
This is the big deal, Boo Boo.
It's my masterpiece.
The Basket-Nabber 2000.
The most advanced pic-a-nic basket-stealing technology ever invented.
Wow.
Climb aboard.
This glider can steer dive, shoot rubber bands at pesky-type birds and even has an air bag.
Had an air bag.
Sorry, Yogi.
Not to worry.
We could cushion our landing with all the pic-a-nic baskets we swipe.
Now, how's that co-pilot seat feel?
A little wobbly, like it's not tied on very tight.
You won't feel that in the air.
Get ready to fly faster than the speed of sandwich, Boo Boo.
We're goanna break the pic-a-nic barrier.
SMITH:
Yogi!
- Uh-oh.
That's not his happy voice.
Don't move.
I'm switching the glider into stealth mode.
Stealth mode?
Wow.
How are you able to...?
Oh.
Ah, Mr. Ranger, sir.
Welcome.
Can I interest you in a sody pop?
- There you go.
- When did you steal our vending machine?
I, um...
I'm repairing it, sir.
This machine gives its sodas away for free when a bear kicks it.
Look, a camper has reported some missing fishing poles so I'm goanna go out on a limb here and say it was you.
Fishing poles?
Sir, I'm a bear.
If I wanted to catch fish, I would just use my...
Your paws, Yogi.
Isn't that kind of unsanitary?
What's that?
- What's what?
- That thing.
- What thing?
- The thing under the blanket.
- Blanket?
- The object right behind you.
Oh.
Oh, that.
Heh.
A sculpture.
I'm sculpting now.
Mostly landscapes.
And where's Boo Boo?
- France.
- What?
- That's not close by, is it?
- No.
Then he's in the bathroom.
- Excuse me.
- Wait!
Hey, this isn't the bathroom.
I'm telling you, Mr. Ranger, it's not for stealing pic-a-nic baskets.
It says "Basket-Nabber 2000" right here, Yogi.
I do regret calling it that now.
I know I'm always saying, "Stay away from the campers."
This is different.
Jelly stone is in real trouble.
If I don't raise $30,000 in a week, this park's getting rezoned.
Rezoned?
What does that mean?
It means the park won't be a park anymore.
The city will use this land for something else.
So we have got to do everything we can to help save it.
Which means you have got to stop stealing food so that campers will leave here happy.
But they do leave here happy.
Getting your food stolen by Yogi Bear is special.
People come here for that.
It's like catching a foul ball at a baseball game.
Nope.
It's like getting your food stolen at a baseball game.
Come on, Yogi.
Would it really be so hard to be a regular bear?
You know, to forage for food, to walk around on all fours to hibernate a little, or a lot.
If nature had meant for me to be a regular bear it wouldn't have given me such a good thought-cooker, sir.
I can't help it if my melon is full of smart juice.
Yogi, your melon is hurting this park.
There are repercussions to stealing people's picnic baskets.
Not in my experience, sir.
{MECHANISM TICKING}
{BELL RINGS}
On the other hand...
Ranger Smith, mind if I borrow the 'dilla?
It's an emergency.
Somebody parked without parking decals.
Jones, I would really prefer it if you focused on just maintaining the park instead.
Let me deal with the visitors until you've had more experience.
Sorry, sir.
Guess that's just the Eagle Scout in me, you know?
Always wanting to be in control, be a leader.
Live up to this fanny pack full of merit badges.
You know that fanny pack is for first aid supplies, right?
A merit badge in first aid is the only supply I need, sir.
Right, but it might not be the only supply a hurt person needs.
You seen Rachel?
Yeah, I saw her.
She was heading up to Lookout Mountain.
She can't be far.
I'll drive.
Let's roll.
Jones.
The sprawling beauty of Jelly stone Park.
A timeless stretch of wilderness untouched by man.
Oh.
Ranger Smith.
Wow, heh.
What's with the fancy outfit?
Dress greens.
I always wear dress greens in the evening.
You know, in case there's, you know...
- I don't know how to talk to girls.
- Oh.
Why do you think I spend so much time with animals?
All you have to do is scratch their backside and you've got a friend for life.
Try that with people and all of a sudden you're the weird girl on the bus that nobody wants to sit next to.
Um, uh, listen.
I was wondering, you know, if you were...
I mean, it's getting late and we could, uh...
If you want.
I mean, it's not that...
You don't...
It's...
You know, it's not a worry.
Don't worry.
Did you just ask me to dinner?
Yes.
I did.
Heh.
- Good, you got that, huh?
- Yes.
I just thought, well, it's getting late.
I happen to know this great place.
- Very gourmet.
- Really?
Where?
So close you won't believe it.
Wow, how did you ever find this place?
This is a four-star porch.
And fresh from the hot plate, I give you rack of Spam.
- Oh.
Wow.
Maybe "gourmet" was a bit of a stretch.
No, it actually looks wonderful.
Great.
You know, this really is a peaceful place.
It's something, isn't it?
I pretty much grew up here.
My father was a ranger when I was a kid and he turned this park into the number one tourist destination in the state.
I mean, it was a park, you know?
Like families came by the hundreds swam in the streams, hiked on the trails.
It was really something.
This is really good.
Anyway, I don't know.
Maybe it's my fault.
I spent so many years learning everything I could about the park so I'd be a better ranger.
Maybe instead, I should have come up with a gimmick to get people to come here.
You know, change the name to Extreme Jelly stone.
- I think that it's perfect just the way it is.
- You do?
You're right.
Absolutely.
There's no better place on earth.
YOGI:
Hey, Mr. Ranger.
- Except a place without him.
Evening, Mr. Ranger, sir.
Madame Moviemaker Lady.
And yes, I'm using the fancy tense to show you the utmost respect.
Hi.
Ha, ha.
What do you want, Yogi?
Well, I was thinking about the park's prickly predicament and I would like to do my part to help.
This is all the money I have saved.
Almost $100.
I was going to use it on myself, but I'd rather donate it to Jelly stone.
Well, thank you, Yogi.
That's...
That is very sweet.
- Where does a bear get money from?
- That brown box by the parking lot.
The park donation box.
Yep.
But I want you to have it.
Consider it a gift to Jelly stone.
That won't be hard.
Look, guys, I appreciate the effort.
But what this park needs is visitors and lots of them.
Well, I can help you there, sir.
Just make me a headliner.
I will rock this place.
- Kick it, Boo Boo.
- Kicking it.
{SIR MIX-A-LOT'S "BABY GOT BACK" PLAYING}
I like big butts and I cannot lie You other brothers can't deny
That when a girl walks in With a itty-bitty waist
And a round thing in your face You get sprung
{MUSIC STOPS}
That's not goanna work either, Yogi.
You're right.
We need something flashier than music.
Not a problem.
I've got this water-skiing routine that will change the face of entertainment.
Got a little of everything.
Music, stunts, magic.
- And I jump over Boo Boo at the end.
- No, you don't.
- I want to try it.
- I don't care.
I hate to interrupt, but you're not goanna water-ski or dance or do anything that might disturb the campers, okay?
If what you really want to do is help save this park you will lay low, stay away from people.
Think you can do that for me?
You have my word, Mr. Ranger.
I will be seen, but not heard.
Or seen.
Fine.
Huh?
You guys done with that Spam?
- Get out of here.
- Okay.
Sheesh!
Hey.
What's this?
Seasons pass applications.
Unfortunately, not a lot of takers on those.
Fifty bucks for an entire year?
Including camping fees?
That's a bargain.
If this were a place people wanted to visit throughout the year.
Maybe Yogi was on to something.
- You said the park was turning 100, right?
- Right.
Well, a big event could really pull people in.
Yeah, you're right.
We could have, like, a moss collection day or a big squirrel chase.
- Or...
- Fireworks.
Yes.
Exactly.
Why didn't I think of that?
We could host a big centennial festival.
People always show up for fireworks.
If even half of the people buy season passes the park makes enough money to stay open.
Right.
Let's get the word out.
I think I can help with that.
{PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY}
That is great.
How did we pay for it?
We didn't.
It was some fast-food restaurant but I rearranged the letters right before the plane took off.
{BOTH CHUCKLE}
You're very cool, Rachel Johnson.
You're pretty cool yourself.
I do have my own kind of natural swagger.
Jelly stone National Park, 100th year anniversary.
There'll be fireworks.
Just stay calm, Jones.
You should be patrolling in the Armadillo making park-impacting decisions, but...
- Hey, 100th year anniversary.
- Thanks.
But you're not there yet.
You still have to follow orders.
Even if those orders make you look like a giant Cheez-It.
Mr. Mayor!
Hi, Mr. Mayor.
Why is it only going halfway down again?
Doesn't make any...
No!
Oh, okay.
Is it a double tap or do I have to press it...?
- Oh, dang it!
- I got it, sir.
Yeah.
That's exactly what I did.
Let me see one of those fliers.
"Come celebrate Jelly stone's 100th anniversary with fireworks and fun."
"And receive $10 off a season pass"?
He's goanna try to make the budget selling season passes.
{BOTH GROAN}
Yeah, ugh.
It's not a very good idea, in my opinion.
But nobody consulted me, because my job is just to maintain the park which is basically poking trash with a stick.
Yeah.
Yeah, why is a guy with your talent doing this insulting grunt work?
You should be running a park.
Yeah, but Ranger Smith says I have to pay my dues.
- Excuse me?
- What?
- He has to pay his dues?
Ha.
- Ha, ha.
Nobody pays dues anymore.
You got to be in charge now while you still know everything.
- That's what I've been saying.
- Yeah.
Buddy, if it was up to me, you would be the head ranger of Jelly stone already.
- You'd put me in charge?
- In a second.
Yes.
You know, if this centennial festival didn't work out, I probably could relocate Smith.
You know, uh, maybe you could help me with that.
Make sure it doesn't succeed?
Wait, you mean, like, sabotage it?
No.
Oh, no, no, no.
No, I want you to be head ranger.
It just so happens that the only way to do that is to bring down this festival.
But spend the rest of your life as second-in-command if you like.
That's fine.
It's a perfectly valid life choice.
Well, you just think about it and give me a call, okay?
Here's my card.
So long.
Hey.
Now why is it doing that?
No.
Boy Scouts are loyal, thrifty, kind...
Hey, you're back.
Hey, thanks for getting those fliers out.
Let me tell you, this festival is goanna be huge.
Hey, Ranger Smith, how long do you think until I reach head ranger status?
Oh, no time at all.
I did it in 12 short years.
Ha, okay.
Are you serious?
Just be patient, Jones.
It'll be here before you know it.
This festival's goanna be great!
I can't wait 12 years.
{PEOPLE CHEERING AND LAUGHING}
Seasons pass order forms.
Seasons pass order forms.
Thank you.
Seasons pass order forms, $10 off today.
Ah, enjoy.
I can't take it, Boo Boo.
Two days without a tasty treat to eat?
And I have to sit up here while they're having a "happy birthday, Jelly stone" party?
And they have doughnuts.
Doughnuts!
BOO BOO {OVER RADIO}:
Yogi, what are you doing?
- Yogi!
- I'm going.
Hey.
Wait.
Don't do it, Yogi.
You promised Mr. Ranger.
You're right.
I'm losing control, Boo Boo.
I don't know who's steering the ship.
Here.
I want you to handcuff me to this tree and not unlock it no matter what I say.
Okay, Yogi.
- Okay, unlock me.
- Huh?
It was a bad idea.
Unlock me.
Unlock me!
Okay.
Here you go.
JONES:
Folks, I hate to say this, but there are no spots left.
Forecast called for thunderstorms.
Severe lightning.
I fear for your young ones.
{CAR HORN HONKING}
We're out of fireworks, I'm afraid.
It's just sparklers left.
Oh, no.
You look nice.
Your napkin matches your tie.
I don't need you to kiss up to me.
Got this guy for that.
That's a good point, sir.
You were goanna handle this situation, yet there are quite a few people here.
Sir, I tried.
All last night I spent taking down fliers.
I blocked the entrance with a vehicle to back up traffic.
I hung up "rabid squirrel" signs everywhere.
Those were hand-drawn.
- Nothing is working.
- You need to think of something, don't you?
Or maybe you're just not head ranger material.
Mr. Mayor.
Mayor's yes man.
So glad you could join us.
I saved you a nice spot next to the porta-potties.
Oh, well, thank you.
Well, that's very thoughtful.
You know, I'm just so glad that these festivities are going so well, Smith.
I just hope nothing goes wrong.
{HORN HONKING}
We are goanna pull this off, Jonesy.
I've seen hundreds of people filling out seasons pass order forms.
The weather's great.
The fireworks, ready to go.
Even Yogi's staying out of the way.
Yogi.
Hey, guys.
Sorry, just wandering around, bored out of my mind.
Bored?
But the 100th anniversary extravaganza's going on.
Yeah, more like 100th anniversary lame-aganza.
You know, because it's so lame.
People see fireworks every day in the city.
They thought they'd see something different here.
I knew it.
I should be out there doing my water-ski routine.
I'm a shining star and Ranger Smith is holding me back.
I don't know, Yogi.
Mr. Ranger is usually right about these things.
No, Boo Boo, Ranger Smith is in denial.
I mean, he's lost it, you know?
I saw him a couple days ago.
He was filling his pockets with dirt.
He said he's goanna start moving the park to his apartment piece by piece.
- How big is his apartment?
- There's still time.
I won't be able to do the half-hour artistic program but that was more for me anyway.
These people need the razzle-dazzle.
I don't think we've practiced the razzle-dazzle.
You're not supposed to, Boo Boo.
That's where it gets the razzle.
Yogi, I really don't think we should...
Boo Boo, you've tried to stop my brilliant ideas with common sense a thousand times.
Has it ever worked?
No.
Then let's go, go, go.
What does that taste like?
Unemployment?
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah.
Thanks again for helping with the fireworks.
I don't know where Jones disappeared to.
My pleasure.
You know, um, Rachel, I've been wanting to tell you well, how much I...
- Ranger...
No, please, let me get through this.
I'm not very good with words.
But I have never felt so gushy.
Ha-ha-ha.
- You know?
- Ranger...
You know what I did?
I went and I wrote a song about you.
It's like this:
Oh, no.
I saw you at the station
Had a heart palpitation
My sickness was love And you're the medication
Rachel
- Rachel
- The microphone is on.
SMITH:
And it comes around again
Rachel, Rachel, Rachel
The microphone is on.
Yes, the mic...
{CLEARS THROAT THEN LAUGHS}
Hi.
Hello and welcome to the 100th anniversary of Jelly stone!
Thank you.
It is so wonderful to see so many people here today.
I've noticed many of you filling out your seasons pass order forms.
We're more than happy to collect those after the fireworks.
But first, please, sit back, get comfortable and enjoy the show!
- Terrific.
- Mr. Mayor?
{POISON'S "NOTHIN' BUT A GOOD TIME" PLAYING ON STEREO}
That's not the right music.
I'll take it from here, Mr. Ranger!
Oh, no.
Full speed ahead, Boo Boo.
Okay.
Not bad, eh, Boo Boo?
Looking good, Yogi.
- This cannot be happening.
- Oh, it's happening.
{YOGI STAMMERING}
Hello, Jelly stone!
{CROWD CHEERING}
No, don't encourage him!
They love me.
I can do no wrong.
Watch this.
All right, Boo Boo!
Turn up the heat!
Phase two, go.
I'm an unstoppable water-skiing machine.
Ta-da!
Oh, wait.
There's more.
How about if I heat things up?
{SMITH WHIMPERS}
Don't need nothing' but a good time
And it don't get better than this
Yogi!
Yogi, your cape.
I know.
It is magnificent.
And on fire.
Huh?
Fire!
- Turn the boat!
- Huh?
- Turn, Boo Boo!
- Hang on, Yogi!
Too much razzle!
{CROWD SCREAMING}
- Nice one.
- Thanks.
{RACHEL GASPS}
Jump!
{ALL GASP}
Let's go.
{SCREAMING AND SHOUTING}
MAN:
Out of my way!
This could not have gone more perfectly.
Hey, you got a little, uh...
Never mind.
Let's go.
{WOOD SNAPPING AND CREAKING}
Mr. Ranger, I thought...
Yogi, that's the problem.
All the thinking.
Hey, you know what would be great?
If you didn't think.
If you could just be a regular bear.
You know, sitting in the woods, minding his own business.
But no, you're different.
You're smart.
And you'd rather spend your days being selfish and destructive while everyone else pays the price.
But I guess it wasn't enough, screwing up my life.
No, this time you had to go and bring down this entire park.
So tell me, Yogi how smart are you now?
Hey, there!
That was quite a show you put on yesterday.
Ha-ha-ha.
I can't wait to see what you do with this.
That's your new assignment.
Evergreen Park.
Oh, I think you're just going to find it delightful.
Oh, and, uh, Ranger Jones is goanna be taking over here.
Ranger Jones?
Well, I have got a press conference to plan.
You see, it turns out I've saved the city.
Don't forget to vote, my friend.
Brown for governor!
Ha-ha-ha.
He's not goanna vote for me, is he?
Uh, no.
You did everything you could.
Doesn't matter.
This park needed a ranger who could make it popular again.
I'm just some guy who knows how old every tree is.
Fat lot of good that did Jelly stone.
Face it.
You and I are just two people who care about things that nobody else does and that's why we're alone.
Or maybe that's why we found each other.
Did you ever think of that?
Rachel, you and this park have one thing in common.
You both deserve a better man than me.
I can't believe he's really gone.
Yogi, are you okay?
I'm done being special, Boo Boo.
Ranger Smith was right.
My whole life, I've been different.
But it's done nothing but hurt people.
The world would be better off if I was only as smart as the average bear.
Yogi, what are you doing?
I'm leaving, Boo Boo.
- I am going to forage for food in the wild.
- Huh?
Might even catch some fish.
With my paws.
I'm just goanna grab a little something for the road.
Some chips and soda.
And this.
Peach pie.
Any more of that casserole?
Top shelf.
I'll be out there.
Fending for myself.
Foraging for food in the wild.
{METAL CLANKING}
Goodbye, horsepower limiter.
There's a new head ranger in town.
Let's see what you got.
Perfect.
I'm sorry, Ranger Smith.
No more food.
No more pic-a-nickers.
How could this get any worse?
{THUNDER BOOMING}
Oh.
Ah, Evergreen Park.
Yes, it is simply delightful.
- Come on.
- I've got it, sir.
This is unbelievable.
Ah, Evergreen Park.
Lovely, isn't it?
This isn't a park.
I can barely breathe in here.
Look at these trees.
They're all plastic.
Oh, no, they're real.
It's just years of smog and pollution have left a plastic-like coating on them.
Think people will be happy you're closing the most beautiful park in the state?
Well, they will be when they find out it's making the city rich and giving each citizen a check for $1000.
How is that even possible?
Oh, well, it turns out that there has been some agricultural interest in the park.
And it's a lot more profitable than people in station wagons making s'mores.
Have a good day, Ranger Smith.
I hate this car.
I hate it.
{CHAINSAWS BUZZING}
Yeah!
Oh, hey, there he is.
Ha-ha-ha.
Whoa, hey, Mr. Mayor!
I, uh...
Just finishing some stamping.
You are doing great, Jones.
I knew you were the guy for this job.
Quick thing.
You'll probably notice some giant trucks rumbling by.
We're just clearing a little patch of trees for my press conference.
No big deal.
Um, wait, you're cutting down trees?
Oh, yeah.
Well, just a few.
It's nothing to worry about.
Actually goanna improve the park quite a bit.
I'll bet one of the first things you noticed as head ranger is that you need more clear spaces here, and you are absolutely right.
Now you can host concerts and Boy Scout jamborees.
That's a pretty smart move there, Head Ranger Jones.
I have some other park improvements I want to run by you.
Oh, splendid, yes.
I think I have a few moments to hear those.
Look into the security arrangements for tomorrow.
I don't want any surprises.
I'll hear what Ding-Dong has to say.
What do you got?
I'm hungrier than the average bear.
I wish I could find a bush that tasted like birthday cake.
Gotcha.
Pretend it's a gummy worm.
Pretend it's a gummy worm.
Yogi, I've been looking everywhere for you.
Not now, Boo Boo.
I'm busy foraging.
Come on, Yogi.
Jelly stone is in trouble.
We need your help.
Nothing I can do, Boo Boo.
I'm average now.
My brain is out of business.
I wouldn't even be standing if my paws didn't hurt.
Quit feeling sorry for yourself.
You know you're not an average bear.
Hey, hey, Boo Boo.
You're right, I'm not.
I failed at that too.
Hey, come back here.
You've got to save Jelly stone.
YOGI:
What are you doing?
I'm not...
Yogi, you have to use your smarts for good.
And if you can't see that, maybe you are just an average bear.
Come on.
Now do you understand?
What's going on, Boo Boo?
I don't know.
But whatever it is I think they're just getting started.
Boo Boo get my collar.
Nobody is goanna hurt Jelly stone.
Where are we going, Yogi?
We can't get Jelly stone back alone, Boo Boo.
My thinker is good, but Ranger Smith's is better.
He was going to a place called Evergreen Park.
That's right.
In the city.
The city?
That's a long walk.
Don't be silly, Boo Boo.
I've already got a smarty-smart cheat to keep our feet off the street.
Get ready for it.
Here it comes.
Run, Boo Boo, run!
Hurry, Boo Boo.
I think we got to jump for it.
Ready?
All aboard.
Good.
Yogi, grab my paw.
Sorry.
{YOGI SHOUTING}
Boo Boo, Boo Boo, Boo Boo!
I got to get...!
I guess it makes a stop here.
Yup.
Looks like Evergreen Park is about two miles away from here.
Two miles?
I'll have to tap into my emergency rations.
Snack break.
Come on, Yogi.
We need to keep moving.
It's not that far and it's all downhill.
Downhill?
Excuse me, Mr. Dirty Shopper.
Any chance my friend and I might borrow your wheely-basket?
Is that chocolate?
{YOGI AND BOO BOO LAUGHING}
Okay, Boo Boo, keep it steady.
I'm okay, Ma.
Just...
Yeah, no, it's not Jelly stone, but at least there's nothing here to drive me crazy.
- Hey, Mr. Ranger.
- Hey, Yogi.
{CART CRASHES}
All right, Ma, I got to call you back.
What are you guys doing here?
We need your help, Mr. Ranger, sir.
But don't worry, my days of goofing things up for you are over.
MAN:
Hey, move that shopping cart!
I'm okay!
I'm just goanna put this over here.
What do you want?
I don't have a life left for you to ruin anymore.
Sir, I know I messed things up and I'm sorry.
I never meant to.
You and Boo Boo are the best friends I ever had.
And I've never done anything but think of myself.
And now Jelly stone is just goanna be a big field of stumps.
What?
They've started cutting down the trees.
"Agricultural interest" is logging.
Oh, no, not our Jelly stone.
We have to save it, sir.
I don't think we can save it, Yogi.
I'm no smarter than you.
I lost Jelly stone.
I lost Rachel.
It's over.
Mr. Ranger, I've learned two things from stealing pic-a-nic baskets.
One:
Light mayonnaise is not nearly as good as regular mayonnaise.
And two:
You can't fail if you never stop trying.
You have to fight for the things you love whether it's a park, a girl or a roast beef sandwich.
Don't give up now.
We're all Jelly stone's got.
You're right, Yogi.
Jelly stone's too important to give up on.
We got to try.
Come on.
- Shotgun.
- Aw.
I never thought I'd see this.
Happy 100th anniversary, Jelly stone.
Isn't that Miss Movie Lady?
RACHEL:
I got to get in there.
You don't understand.
Let me in, please.
No can do.
Park is closed to the public until the press conference.
Mayor's orders.
Then go talk to him.
Tell him what I told you.
I'm sorry.
I don't really take orders from a...
I lived with gorillas, pal.
I know rage.
You do not want me to go gorilla on you.
Uh, I'll speak to the mayor.
- Thank you.
- Okay.
Rachel.
Ranger Smith.
I didn't think I'd ever see you again.
I know.
I don't know what I was thinking.
I think you're perfect.
I think any guy in the world would be lucky just to stand next to you.
You really mean that?
Of course I do.
It's just, when I lost Jelly stone, I felt like such a failure.
But losing you has felt much, much worse.
I'm like...
I'm like a genus without a phylum.
That's the sweetest thing anyone's ever said to me.
- So, um, we're still here.
YOGI:
Mm-hm.
Oh, right.
Ahem.
So, what are you doing here?
- Come on, I'll show you.
- Okay.
I was reviewing the documentary footage from Boo Boo's camera and I saw this.
Oh, my.
I see it.
I have a bald spot back there!
I'm not talking about you, Yogi.
I'm talking about this.
Yeah, it's my pet turtle.
He hangs out at the cave all the time.
True.
You know they don't come out of that shell?
I tried one time to see what one would look like without it.
But, nope, they're sewn in.
This is no regular turtle.
See the bulging frog-like eyes and the really wide mouth?
A frog-mouthed turtle?
Yup, Rafetus swinhoei.
SMITH:
But those are extinct.
For a hundred years, but apparently one still exists.
And he lives in there.
But they won't let me through the gates to go find him.
But if Jelly stone has an endangered species living in it, then...
It has to be protected as a park.
That's the law.
That turtle can save this park.
Now I feel kinda bad about using him as a foot stool.
CHIEF:
You've seen the filmmaker?
Well, we spoke.
About extinct turtles.
You're telling me there is an extinct turtle living here in the park?
According to Miss Johnson's film, there is.
An extinct turtle?
That's great.
Visitors will come from miles around to see an endangered species.
Yes, they will, and that is great.
We need to find this turtle.
Just to keep it safe.
Have a vet check it out.
The whole deal.
The sooner we get to him the better.
Oh, we need a head ranger who's good enough to find it.
Someone who thinks like a turtle.
I am that head ranger.
Well, then why are you still here?
He's back.
Come on.
You need to let us in this park.
That turtle needs protection.
Don't worry about the turtle.
We're handling it.
We'll make sure he's put in a nice zoo.
No.
A turtle that's endangered can't be removed from its natural habitat.
It's against federal law.
It is?
Wow, I've never heard of that law in chapter 4, subsection 6 of the Wildlife Protection Mandate.
Don't worry, Mr. Ranger, sir.
That turtle is safe.
These people have no idea where my cave is.
The turtle's in the talking bear's cave.
JONES {OVER RADIO}:
Copy.
Wow, that backfired.
Okay.
You know what?
Fine,
You win.
What are you doing?
I have a plan.
One of the advantages of having lived here since I was a kid is I know this park like the back of my hand.
Let's go!
Hold on, boys.
All right.
Hey, there, little buddy.
Hello, there.
Uh-oh.
Sorry about that.
- Mayor Brown.
- This had better be good, Jones.
JONES:
I found the turtle.
He was in Boo Boo's sleeping bag.
But now I have him secure at the picnic area.
Jones, you're a hero.
Sit tight.
My chief of staff is on his way to get him.
Copy that.
Head Ranger Jones over and out.
SMITH:
He found the turtle.
Dang it.
Can't cross those rapids.
There's no way to get to him from here.
Well, there is one way.
There it is.
My masterpiece.
- You really think you can pull this off?
- I know I can, sir.
I'm goanna snatch that basket-type turtle box and fly away like a fuzzy bird.
And I've got the best co-pilot a basket-snatching machine could have.
- I don't know how to fly this thing.
- Well, you'll pick it up as we go.
SMITH:
Okay.
Look, just be careful, okay, Yogi?
Copy that, ground control.
Basket-Nabber 2000 ready for takeoff.
- Flight systems check.
Boo Boo?
- What?
- Can you reach the pedals?
- If I point my toes.
Flight systems are go.
Remember what I told you about flying gliders, Yogi.
Don't fight the wind.
As long as the wind wants me to snatch up that turtle, we'll get along just fine.
- All right.
YOGI:
Start pedalling, Boo Boo.
All right.
Here goes.
YOGI:
Hold on, Boo Boo.
Fasten your seat belt.
But there isn't one.
YOGI:
Here we go!
BOO BOO:
Oh, Yogi!
The wind should carry you south!
We'll meet you there!
Take your time, Mr. Ranger.
This machine is equipped with landing gear.
We'll touchdown as soft as a feather.
Whoops.
This is your captain speaking.
We'll reach our turtle target in about two minutes.
So let's go ahead and start the beverage service.
- Yogi, look out.
- Aah!
- Trees!
- Yes, trees!
{BOTH SCREAMING}
I got it.
I got it.
I got it.
I don't got it!
BOO BOO:
Pull up.
- Hey!
- Pull up!
You did it, Yogi.
Oh.
Yeah.
Ha-ha-ha.
Great job, Jones.
I'll get this guy to the city zoo.
- The city zoo?
- Yep.
They got a nice spot ready in the reptile house.
The city zoo doesn't have a reptile house.
They're building one.
- Who is?
- Builders.
Sure you're trying to protect the turtle?
Yeah, we love turtles.
Then you won't mind if I hold onto him until I notify the Wildlife Federation, right?
All right.
You're goanna find this out in a few hours anyway, so I might as well tell you.
We got to lose this turtle to sell logging rights to the park.
Logging?
The whole park?
Yeah, but who cares?
It's still a park, just without trees.
And they'll grow back.
Yeah, in like 200 years.
It doesn't matter.
Your career is what matters.
Ha-ha-ha.
Turtle target acquired.
I need 20 more feet of altitude.
Engage the hand pedals.
You couldn't put the hand pedals by you?
There's a suggestion box behind the seat, Boo Boo.
Wait, you don't want to approach him like that.
He's poisonous.
He's in a basket.
But he can spit.
Poison.
He'll aim at your eyes.
Melt them out of your head.
- I'm telling you, that turtle is deadly.
- What are you looking at?
- Hook me in, Boo Boo.
- Okay.
And fire!
Here you go.
Huh?
Yogi, wait!
Here I come!
He's going for the turtle.
- Mind if I borrow this?
- Hey!
{YOGI LAUGHS}
Look, Boo Boo!
We got the turtle!
Hey, why aren't you in your seat?
That bear knows how to steal a basket.
Everybody after that glider now!
I'm not goanna let a bear make me look bad.
Been there, buddy.
We're drifting too far right.
I want to get us outside the park.
Don't fight the wind, Yogi.
Remember what Miss Movie Lady said about...
Never mind.
YOGI:
Hang on, Boo Boo.
- What do we do now?
Did you check the safety manual?
It's just a picture of us screaming.
{BOTH SCREAMING}
We've got to deject, Boo.
Don't you mean eject?
Eject is up.
Deject is down.
In case of emergency your seat can also be used as a flotation device!
{YOGI LAUGHING}
Hey, told you.
Nothing to worry about.
I actually think I wasn't worried enough.
Let me see how our little passenger is doing.
Wonder why they call him a frog-mouthed turtle anyway?
Hey!
SMITH:
Hey, guys, over here!
Yogi, grab the branch.
Got you, Mr. Ranger, sir.
{SMITH AND RACHEL GRUNT}
- Welcome aboard.
SMITH:
Yogi.
We were trying to get you off the raft.
Yeah, that makes more sense.
You guys did it.
You saved him.
{CAR HORN HONKS}
Oh, no.
They're goanna catch us downstream.
I'm on it.
No, Yogi, don't.
Problem solved.
They can't catch us now.
Yeah, because now we are headed straight for the Jelly jarring Rapids.
- Grab a paddle.
- Tuck your head in, little buddy.
Brace yourselves.
Oh, come on, turtle.
Don't worry, I put safety belts in this raft for just such an occasion.
You better hang on.
Mr. Ranger said...
YOGI:
We're goanna be fine, Boo Boo.
Just sit back and let Mother Nature carry us to... {ALL SCREAMING}
I think Mother Nature's kind of cranky today.
You okay, Yogi?
Fine!
Turtle!
YOGI:
Who's that?
I can't see.
Come here, turtle.
- Got him.
SMITH:
Good work, Boo Boo.
We made it through the rapids.
Yeah, but that means the falls are just up ahead.
Hold on!
Yogi.
Yogi.
Now who says there are no rides at Jelly stone?
Yeah, you've definitely got the thrill part down.
ANNOUNCER:
Please, take your seats.
The press conference is about to begin.
That's over a mile away.
We're never goanna make that in time.
{ALL GASP}
- Ranger Jones?
- I messed up pretty bad, sir.
- I know.
It's okay.
- I wanted to be head ranger.
Because you're a good head ranger and I value leadership.
I have a merit badge...
Can we talk later?
We're pressed for time.
Yes.
Get in.
{SIREN WAILING}
YOGI:
Boo Boo!
Boo Boo!
Wait up!
SMITH:
Well, well.
Guess who we found.
Starts with T and ends with a..."Urtle"?
It's over.
Call off the logging.
The law says this park is now a protected nature preserve.
You think I care about what the law says?
Or about some endangered "frog-mouthed turtle"?
Or some stupid park for families to have a picnic in?
I care about power, you pinheads!
And I'm goanna get it.
Nobody knows this turtle exists.
And nobody ever will.
You found the turtle.
Get this thing out of here before anybody else sees it.
- Rachel!
- Oh!
Yogi!
BOO BOO:
Yogi, here!
Thank you.
- Yogi.
- I'm sorry.
He was open.
Ha, ha.
Now if you'll excuse me, I have a press conference.
I can still tell them what you did.
Oh, yeah?
Without that turtle or a scrap of evidence, go right ahead.
Well, you might as well tell them Bigfoot is here.
Ha-ha-ha.
And do yourself a favour, there, ranger.
Try to keep your dignity.
It's all you have left.
You know what?
I'm taking care of this thing myself this time.
That's the only way to make sure the job is done right.
But that's why I'm the mayor's right-hand man, right?
Because I don't make mistakes.
Hey, you know, people are wondering:
"Why should I vote for Mayor Brown to be governor?"
Well, how about this:
Mayor Brown just turned the city's budget from a deficit into a surplus!
And put $1000 into the pocket of every citizen of this city!
Now before I sign the paperwork that will save the city why don't you all take a look at my first campaign ad for governor?
ANNOUNCER:
Mayor Brown, the right choice for governor.
We're out of time.
Must be something we can do.
Anybody have any ideas?
Well, I guess this is going to be a pretty sad documentary, huh?
Are you...?
Is he still filming?
I needed more footage, so I told him to keep it rolling.
I can plug that into the video feed right up there.
I just need a way to distract the guards.
I think we can take care of that.
ANNOUNCER:
He supports public safety.
{JOURNEY'S "DON'T STOP BELIEVING" PLAYING ON TV}
All right, hurry up, people.
Focus.
Let's go save those orphans.
YOGI:
Hey, hey, hey, check this out!
- Kick it, Boo Boo.
- Kicking it.
Don't stop believing
Hold on to that feeling
ANNOUNCER:
He's tough on crime.
Hey, hey, hey, look at this.
Keep your eye on the little bear.
Look at the skills.
Amazing!
ANNOUNCER:
And here's what Mayor Brown proudly has to say about protecting our natural resources.
{MUSIC STOPS}
You think I care about what the law says?
Or about some endangered "frog-mouthed turtle"?
- Some stupid park for families to picnic in?
- No.
No.
No.
I care about power, you pinheads!
Oh, boy.
Nobody knows this turtle exists.
And nobody ever will.
{BOOING AND JEERING}
There's about to be a riot out there.
I need you out front.
Okay.
No.
Hey, wait.
Wait, wait, wait.
Please, please, please.
That was not real.
Trust me, there is no such thing as a frog-mouthed turtle.
He's right next to me, isn't he?
Okay.
- We did it, Yogi!
- Up high, Boo Boo!
- All right!
JONES:
We got it!
Yogi!
All right, and now...
Miss Moviemaker Lady.
SMITH:
Hey, we did it.
Hey, Mr. Ranger!
RACHEL:
Come on, Boo Boo.
- Okay.
I was wrong, Yogi.
I say from here on, we just be proud of who we are and fight for the things we're passionate about, like this park.
And Rachel.
And pic-a-nic baskets?
And pic-a-nic baskets.
- Aw, come here!
- No, you don't have to...
Okay.
All right, that's...
I'm good.
{CROWD CHATTERING}
RACHEL:
Here you go, Boo Boo.
Take good care of him.
Hey, there, buddy.
No, no, no, I never took a kickback on anything in my entire career.
No one loves turtles more than I do.
And nature in general.
I love trees.
Oh, no, you don't!
Gorilla?
Himalayan snow leopard.
Huh.
Welcome to Jelly stone, home of the frog-mouthed turtle.
And brochures.
I'm Ranger Jones.
NARRATOR:
Ah, yes, Jelly stone Park.
A wonderful little piece of paradise.
Where families come and soak up the tranquillity of nature.
It's a place that... {MACHINE WHIRRING}
Huh?
Never mind.
MAN:
Hey, hey, hey!
{CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY}
Hi.
Welcome.
Well, I am certainly glad that you are goanna be staying in Jelly stone for a while.
And what animal will you be observing?
Well, I thought I would observe the courting rituals of the American ranger.
I happen to hear the American ranger is a very charming intelligent, attractive species.
One that always keeps his cool.
Even when basket-stealing bears push his buttons?
Listen, Yogi will be Yogi.
And I'm just not goanna let it bother me anymore.
Besides I have more important things to focus on.
Oh...
I...
Let's...
Let's try that again.
{HORN HONKING}
Afternoon, Mr. Ranger, sir!
Hi, Miss Movie Lady!
Yogi!
I love this place.
SMITH:
Yogi!
Hey!
Jellystone Park.
One of the nation's oldest and most beautiful stretches of wilderness.
For years, families have headed out from the busy city eager to enjoy a little camping, fishing and, of course, observing the park's natural wildlife.
Boo Boo, I think it's time I introduced myself to that pic-a-nic basket.
You know, Yogi, we could just hunt for food.
All the other animals do.
Boo Boo, a pic-a-nic basket has everything a bear needs.
And I'm not just talking about the treats and snack-type goodies.
No.
A pic-a-nic basket holds a lot more than that.
It holds dreams.
What are we looking at?
I don't know.
Hook me in.
You sure it'll work, Yogi?
Well, you know, Boo Boo, I'm smarter than the average bear!
All right!
Ranger Smith!
Sorry about that.
We got a 4-23 in Redwood Valley, sir.
- A what?
- A bear disturbance.
- L think it's probably-- - l know who it is.
Why didn't you just say "bear disturbance"?
Well, I....
Uh, well, it sounds cooler.
I mean, we're park rangers, sir.
You know:
"To protect and preserve."
Did you just make that motto up?
Yeah, I did.
Do you like it?
Ranger Jones, you know that, well, being a park ranger, it's not about mottos.
It's about keeping the park safe.
That's where the glory is.
Protecting all of this.
Yeah, I know.
Besides, that motto was still in the testing phase.
It's not like I made T-shirts or anything.
Heh, no, of course not.
Okay, I'm gonna deal with that 4-23.
Okay, copy that, sir.
Um, I'm actually gonna hop in the Armadillo, make some rounds.
Jones, you know that the Armadillo is for head ranger use only.
I might need it at any moment to deal with a park emergency.
Why don't you finish stacking those trail maps?
Yeah, sure.
Okay.
Yeah, because that's what future head rangers do, they stack maps.
Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy!
Our days of getting banged up to grab a meal are over, Boo Boo.
From now on, the pic-a-nic baskets are going to fall into our arms.
Soldering iron.
- Here you go.
- Thank you.
Okay.
That should do it.
Test rock.
Okay, Yogi.
Weight sensor triggered.
Basket in position.
Launch spring starts coiling.
Firing pin drops.
And....
Bull's-eye!
I'm so smart it hurts!
You're standing on the soldering iron.
Or it's that.
Hot, hot, hot!
There's the test rock.
Now we just wait here for a pic-a-nic basket to fall into our arms.
Are you sure about this, Yogi?
People seem to get pretty mad when you--
A genius never questions his instincts, Boo Boo.
When you have a mind like mine you can't blink or you'll put a kink in your think.
Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.
We've got our first customers.
And they have pie!
I wonder what kind it is.
Yogi, are you out here?
- Lt's Mr. Ranger.
- Aah!
Get rid of the test rock.
Destroy the evidence.
L was never here.
Look-
- Ow!
Hello, Mr. Ranger, sir.
Did you just--?
Did you guys--?
Did you--?
Oh, never mind.
Look, there was a complaint about a bear interfering with a family picnic.
I see.
And you'd like us to mount some sort of investigation?
No, I think it was you.
What?
!
How can you even think that?
Are you feverish?
Let me press my lips against your forehead.
Wait!
You're not pressing your lips against my forehead.
Hey, it's a lot better than the way they take my temperature.
No, look, Yogi, we've been over this many times.
Bears are supposed to avoid people, not run around stealing their food.
I agree, sir.
That's why my friend Boo Boo and I would never think of disturbing a family's pic-a-nic.
Huh.
It missed.
Good day, Mr. Ranger, sir.
We'll keep our eyes peeled.
I wonder if he noticed the pie.
Ra-
- Smith.
You have a vis-
- Over.
Didn't understand a word of that, Jones.
- Sorry.
Some lady's here to see you.
- Send her in.
- Okay.
I'll be in the Armadillo.
- Or you could be....
- Map stacking?
- Map stacking.
- Ranger Smith?
- Yes.
- Hello.
L'm Rachel Johnson.
- Hi.
I was hoping to talk to you about filming a documentary here.
Sure.
L can handle you for that.
Handle that for you.
Sorry.
My work isn't-- My brain isn't working right.
- L must have inhaled some jimsonweed.
- Oh.
Datura stramonium.
It's known to cause delirium...
- ...cramping and nausea.
Heh.
- Cramping and nausea.
You've read The North American Wilderness Guide.
Yeah, I like to highlight all the plants and animals l see.
- L like to-
- Me too.
- Ha, ha!
Yeah.
Ranger Smith.
At your service.
You want to film a documentary in Jellystone?
Yes.
I sent you a letter about a month ago.
- Written on a piece of bark.
- That was you!
Yes.
L'm sorry about that.
I was in Sumatra, living among the orangutans at the time and they get very nervous if they spot anything from the modern world.
Really?
Wow, that's amazing.
Then what did you use for ink?
Bird poop and spit.
Impressive.
So, what are you here to film?
Well, I was hoping to shoot a local species.
Something to really capture the beauty of a national park.
Terrific.
What animal were you thinking?
I heard you had an unusual brown bear.
- Brown bear?
- Yes.
One that talks?
Those are so rare.
- None that I can think of.
- Named Yogi?
Wears a hat and a tie?
No, that doesn't ring a bell.
I think he's standing on the roof, trying to steal your lunchbox.
I smell PB and J.
I'm all done.
Oh, right.
That Yogi.
Bankrupt?
No, no, no.
We're a city.
Cities don't go bankrupt.
They do when they're broke, sir.
We just have to find some money somewhere.
I'm about to run for governor.
How am I gonna do that when my own city is bankrupt?
Okay, yes.
Thank you.
- Here's the invoice, Mr. Mayor.
- Yikes!
Wow.
Ha.
I'm gonna pretend I didn't see that.
Just bill it to the city, okay?
Thank you.
Ugh.
How did we ever go so broke?
- L think we just spent too much.
- Hmm.
Is there anything we can sell?
You already sold the public golf course to condo developers two of the three fire stations to that frozen yogurt company.
You were selling the library, but it burned down.
Oh, yeah.
That was gonna be one of those make-your-own-doughnut places.
- No.
- Yeah.
- Lf you could dream it up, you could make it.
- Ah.
Love those.
We gotta think of something here.
Well, if we don't have anything to sell, maybe we can profit off what we can't sell.
I don't understand those words.
Like when we sold the bottling rights to the water in Lake Beuclair.
- We made a fortune.
- Yeah.
Sinkhole Beuclair is a great place to throw old mattresses.
- Oh, yeah.
- Hmm.
We just don't have any more resources to exploit.
Or do we?
Jellystone.
If we rezone Jellystone Park as agricultural land, we can sell the logging rights.
Here.
This company says they'll give us thousands of dollars an acre just to cut down the trees or something.
That'll be enough to balance the budget and give each citizen a big fat check.
You have any idea how many votes that'll buy me?
- Enough to be the next governor?
- Exactly.
You're fine, Yogi.
It's just a few scrapes and bruises.
I don't know, Mr. Ranger.
I'm pretty sure I heard my spine snap.
Well, you wouldn't be able to stand.
And you wouldn't be able to eat.
I'm okay!
Yogi, Boo Boo, I would like to introduce you to Rachel Johnson who's here to make a nature documentary.
What the heck was that?
I was saying hello.
I lived in a den with brown bears for six months.
Only bear I've ever lived with is Boo Boo.
And he only makes that sound after he's eaten baked beans.
Heh, heh.
I have problems with baked beans.
And for a little bear, he makes a lot of stink.
Okay, I have some fantastic river otters you can film instead.
- Could get a hat and tie on the slow one.
- No, you know, I really, really like these two.
- Would you guys mind if I shoot you?
- Huh?
Yogi, I think she meant with a camera.
Yes.
Of course with a camera.
Heh-heh-heh.
I knew that.
But not just any camera.
This isn't gonna make me look fat, is it?
No, you are gonna look great.
Okay, just a few more adjustments.
Please, excuse the pre-tied bow tie.
My mornings are often rushed.
It's fine, Boo Boo.
This is going to be a whole new perspective for a documentary.
The Boo Boo cam will capture the true wilderness in all its natural glory.
No other human in sight.
That sounds like my apartment.
Ha, ha.
Uh, you know, because I live alone.
Well, plenty of women have tried to change that.
It's just, I haven't found one that--
- Likes you?
- What?
No.
No, that--
Will return your calls?
Can you stop helping, please?
Sir, I can see you like this lady.
But your courting rituals need work.
What you need to do is follow her around for two days making snorting sounds.
Then fight any male that looks at her.
And then, of course, urinate on her to mark her as your territory.
Works every time.
I got it under control, Yogi.
- Boo Boo, you're rolling.
- Cool.
Yogi Bear, a brown bear commonly found in North America and Alaska.
Weighing up to 1800 pounds, brown bears are also the national animal of Finland.
I don't think you have to narrate.
But I liked where you were going with it, Boo Boo.
- L was hooked.
- Really?
Yes.
Now try to film from flattering angles, if you know what I mean.
Pic-a-nic baskets may be delicious on the lips, but they're a lifetime on the hips.
Oh, no.
Ranger Smith!
Ranger Smith.
The mayor's here.
What's he doing here?
Why didn't he give us more warning?
I have to secure the area.
All units, lock down the park.
Repeat, lock down the park.
Jones, you know I'm the only other ranger here, right?
Yeah.
- Ranger Smith, we need to talk.
- You could've just called.
Yeah, but I thought this would be more friendly.
I'm really working on my people skills.
Anyway, I am closing your park down.
- Okay.
- What?
Oh, yeah, this place just costs the city way too much money.
Jellystone hasn't made its operating budget in 10 years.
You know, it's hard to compete with all those amusement parks--
Oh, hey, you're not kidding.
Oh, have you guys been to Lincoln Log Land yet?
Oh, man, they have got a roller coaster there, it's made completely out of logs.
It's just like they rode in the pioneer days.
It's unbelievable.
Sir, Jellystone is special.
Okay?
It's turning 100 years old this very year.
Why, it's a landmark.
I would never let it be closed down.
Well, uh, you actually don't have a choice.
Have you read the city bylaws lately?
Chapter 6.
Section 73.
"Any municipal property that can't generate enough money to cover its operating budget can be rezoned for other uses."
And since Jellystone loses money every year, we're shutting it down.
Uh, sorry?
- L thought that went well.
- Yeah.
Just a second, Mr. Mayor.
Who says we can't cover our budget?
Park doesn't report earnings till next quarter.
Yeah, which is like one week away.
Come on, Smith.
You gotta be $20,000 in the hole.
We wish.
Yeah.
Try 30,562.
That's probably a couple hundred extra for the map stand.
I think it's confession time.
- L only pretended to fix it.
- Thanks, Jones.
Sounds like you're in pretty deep there, Smith.
Maybe we are.
But this is one of the last places families can go to be close to nature.
The world needs that.
Well, I'm not mayor of the world.
I'm mayor of this city.
And this city needs this park rezoned.
I'm sorry.
I feel awful about it.
Even though I look really good.
This is a new suit.
So, okay.
Maybe we don't have our operating budget today.
But you know what?
- A lot can happen in a week.
- All right.
Have it your way.
Take a week.
Hey, I'll even get you started.
What's the admission fee for one car again?
Four dollars.
Four dollars, huh?
Four whole dollars?
Well, that changes everything.
Oh, my goodness.
Well, I only need to come back in here like, uh, what, 10,000 more times?
In a week!
Do I have time for that?
- Lmpossible.
- Oh, shoot.
You want-a some-a lasagna?
You hungry, buddy?
Of course!
I'm always hungry.
I was talking to my pet turtle.
Here you go.
That better not be my beefjerky.
So, what's the big deal, Yogi?
This is the big deal, Boo Boo.
It's my masterpiece.
The Basket-Nabber 2000.
The most advanced pic-a-nic basket-stealing technology ever invented.
Wow.
Climb aboard.
This glider can steer dive, shoot rubber bands at pesky-type birds and even has an air bag.
Had an air bag.
Sorry, Yogi.
Not to worry.
We could cushion our landing with all the pic-a-nic baskets we swipe.
Now, how's that copilot seat feel?
A little wobbly, like it's not tied on very tight.
You won't feel that in the air.
Get ready to fly faster than the speed of sandwich, Boo Boo.
We're gonna break the pic-a-nic barrier.
- Yogi!
- Uh-oh.
That's not his happy voice.
Don't move.
I'm switching the glider into stealth mode.
Stealth mode?
Wow.
How are you able to--?
Oh.
Ah, Mr. Ranger, sir.
Welcome.
Can I interest you in a sody pop?
- There you go.
- When did you steal our vending machine?
I, um-- l'm repairing it, sir.
This machine gives its sodas away for free when a bear kicks it.
Look, a camper has reported some missing fishing poles so I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say it was you.
Fishing poles?
Sir, I'm a bear.
If I wanted to catch fish, I would just use my....
Your paws, Yogi.
Isn't that kind of unsanitary?
What's that?
- What's what?
- That thing.
- What thing?
- The thing under the blanket.
- Blanket?
- The object right behind you.
Oh.
Oh, that.
Heh.
A sculpture.
I'm sculpting now.
Mostly landscapes.
And where's Boo Boo?
- France.
- What?
- That's not close by, is it?
- No.
Then he's in the bathroom.
- Excuse me.
- Wait!
Hey, this isn't the bathroom.
I'm telling you, Mr. Ranger, it's not for stealing pic-a-nic baskets.
It says "Basket-Nabber 2000" right here, Yogi.
I do regret calling it that now.
I know I'm always saying, "Stay away from the campers."
This is different.
Jellystone is in real trouble.
If I don't raise $30,000 in a week, this park's getting rezoned.
Rezoned?
What does that mean?
It means the park won't be a park anymore.
The city will use this land for something else.
So we have got to do everything we can to help save it.
Which means you have gotta stop stealing food so that campers will leave here happy.
But they do leave here happy.
Getting your food stolen by Yogi Bear is special.
People come here for that.
It's like catching a foul ball at a baseball game.
Nope.
It's like getting your food stolen at a baseball game.
Come on, Yogi.
Would it really be so hard to be a regular bear?
You know, to forage for food, to walk around on all fours to hibernate a little, or a lot.
If nature had meant for me to be a regular bear it wouldn't have given me such a good thought-cooker, sir.
I can't help it if my melon is full of smart juice.
Yogi, your melon is hurting this park.
There are repercussions to stealing people's picnic baskets.
Not in my experience, sir.
On the other hand--
Ranger Smith, mind if I borrow the 'dilla?
It's an emergency.
Somebody parked without parking decals.
Jones, I would really prefer it if you focused on just maintaining the park instead.
Let me deal with the visitors until you've had more experience.
Sorry, sir.
Guess that's just the Eagle Scout in me, you know?
Always wanting to be in control, be a leader.
Live up to this fanny pack full of merit badges.
You know that fanny pack is for first aid supplies, right?
A merit badge in first aid is the only supply I need, sir.
Right, but it might not be the only supply a hurt person needs.
You seen Rachel?
Yeah, I saw her.
She was heading up to Lookout Mountain.
She can't be far.
L'll drive.
Let's roll.
Jones.
The sprawling beauty of Jellystone Park.
A timeless stretch of wilderness untouched by man.
Oh.
Ranger Smith.
Wow, heh.
What's with the fancy outfit?
Dress greens.
I always wear dress greens in the evening.
You know, in case there's, you know- l don't know how to talk to girls.
- Oh.
Why do you think I spend so much time with animals?
All you have to do is scratch their backside and you've got a friend for life.
Try that with people and all of a sudden you're the weird girl on the bus that nobody wants to sit next to.
Um, uh, listen.
L was wondering, you know, if you were--
I mean, it's getting late and we could, uh-- If you want.
I mean, it's not that-
- You don't-
- It's--
You know, it's not a worry.
Don't worry.
Did you just ask me to dinner?
Yes.
L did.
Heh.
- Good, you got that, huh?
- Yes.
I just thought, well, it's getting late.
I happen to know this great place.
- Very gourmet.
- Really?
Where?
So close you won't believe it.
Wow, how did you ever find this place?
This is a four-star porch.
And fresh from the hot plate, I give you...
- ...rack of Spam.
- Oh.
Wow.
Maybe "gourmet" was a bit of a stretch.
No, it actually looks wonderful.
Great.
You know, this really is a peaceful place.
It's something, isn't it?
I pretty much grew up here.
My father was a ranger when I was a kid and he turned this park into the number one tourist destination in the state.
I mean, it was a park, you know?
Like families came by the hundreds swam in the streams, hiked on the trails.
It was really something.
This is really good.
Anyway, I don't know.
Maybe it's my fault.
I spent so many years learning everything I could about the park so I'd be a better ranger.
Maybe instead, I should have come up with a gimmick to get people to come here.
You know, change the name to Extreme Jellystone.
- L think that it's perfect just the way it is.
- You do?
You're right.
Absolutely.
There's no better place on earth.
- Hey, Mr. Ranger.
- Except a place without him.
Evening, Mr. Ranger, sir.
Madame Moviemaker Lady.
And yes, I'm using the fancy tense to show you the utmost respect.
Hi.
Ha, ha.
What do you want, Yogi?
Well, I was thinking about the park's prickly predicament and I would like to do my part to help.
This is all the money I have saved.
Almost $100.
I was going to use it on myself, but I'd rather donate it to Jellystone.
Well, thank you, Yogi.
That's--
That is very sweet.
- Where does a bear get money from?
- That brown box by the parking lot.
The park donation box.
Yep.
But I want you to have it.
Consider it a gift to Jellystone.
That won't be hard.
Look, guys, I appreciate the effort.
But what this park needs is visitors and lots of them.
Well, I can help you there, sir.
Just make me a headliner.
I will rock this place.
- Kick it, Boo Boo.
- Kicking it.
I like big butts and I cannot lie You other brothers can't deny
That when a girl walks in With a itty-bitty waist
And a round thing in your face You get sprung
That's not gonna work either, Yogi.
You're right.
We need something flashier than music.
Not a problem.
I've got this water-skiing routine that will change the face of entertainment.
Got a little of everything.
Music, stunts, magic.
- And I jump over Boo Boo at the end.
- No, you don't.
- L want to try it.
- L don't care.
I hate to interrupt, but you're not gonna water-ski or dance or do anything that might disturb the campers, okay?
If what you really want to do is help save this park you will lay low, stay away from people.
Think you can do that for me?
You have my word, Mr. Ranger.
I will be seen, but not heard.
Or seen.
Fine.
Huh?
You guys done with that Spam?
- Get out of here.
- Okay.
Sheesh!
Hey.
What's this?
Seasons pass applications.
Unfortunately, not a lot of takers on those.
Fifty bucks for an entire year?
Including camping fees?
That's a bargain.
If this were a place people wanted to visit throughout the year.
Maybe Yogi was on to something.
- You said the park was turning 100, right?
- Right.
Well, a big event could really pull people in.
Yeah, you're right.
We could have, like, a moss collection day or a big squirrel chase.
- Or....
- Fireworks.
Yes.
Exactly.
Why didn't I think of that?
We could host a big centennial festival.
People always show up for fireworks.
If even half of the people buy season passes the park makes enough money to stay open.
Right.
Let's get the word out.
I think I can help with that.
That is great.
How did we pay for it?
We didn't.
It was some fast-food restaurant but I rearranged the letters right before the plane took off.
You're very cool, Rachel Johnson.
You're pretty cool yourself.
I do have my own kind of natural swagger.
Jellystone National Park, 1 00th year anniversary.
There'll be fireworks.
Just stay calm, Jones.
You should be patrolling in the Armadillo making park-impacting decisions, but--
- Hey, 1 00th year anniversary.
- Thanks.
But you're not there yet.
You still have to follow orders.
Even if those orders make you look like a giant Cheez-It.
Mr. Mayor!
Hi, Mr. Mayor.
Why is it only going halfway down again?
Doesn't make any-
- No!
Oh, okay.
Ls it a double tap or do I have to press it--?
- Oh, dang it!
- L got it, sir.
Yeah.
That's exactly what I did.
Let me see one of those fliers.
"Come celebrate Jellystone's 1 00th anniversary with fireworks and fun."
"And receive $10 off a season pass"?
He's gonna try to make the budget selling season passes.
Yeah, ugh.
Lt's not a very good idea, in my opinion.
But nobody consulted me, because my job is just to maintain the park which is basically poking trash with a stick.
Yeah.
Yeah, why is a guy with your talent doing this insulting grunt work?
You should be running a park.
Yeah, but Ranger Smith says I have to pay my dues.
- Excuse me?
- What?
- He has to pay his dues?
Ha.
- Ha, ha.
Nobody pays dues anymore.
You gotta be in charge now while you still know everything.
- That's what I've been saying.
- Yeah.
Buddy, if it was up to me, you would be the head ranger of Jellystone already.
- You'd put me in charge?
- Ln a second.
Yes.
You know, if this centennial festival didn't work out, I probably could relocate Smith.
You know, uh, maybe you could help me with that.
Make sure it doesn't succeed?
Wait, you mean, like, sabotage it?
No.
Oh, no, no, no.
No, I want you to be head ranger.
It just so happens that the only way to do that is to bring down this festival.
But spend the rest of your life as second-in-command if you like.
That's fine.
It's a perfectly valid life choice.
Well, you just think about it and give me a call, okay?
Here's my card.
So long.
Hey.
Now why is it doing that?
No.
Boy Scouts are loyal, thrifty, kind....
Hey, you're back.
Hey, thanks for getting those fliers out.
Let me tell you, this festival is gonna be huge.
Hey, Ranger Smith, how long do you think until I reach head ranger status?
Oh, no time at all.
I did it in 12 short years.
Ha, okay.
Are you serious?
Just be patient, Jones.
It'll be here before you know it.
This festival's gonna be great!
I can't wait 12 years.
Seasons pass order forms.
Seasons pass order forms.
Thank you.
Seasons pass order forms, $10 off today.
Ah, enjoy.
I can't take it, Boo Boo.
Two days without a tasty treat to eat?
And I have to sit up here while they're having a "happy birthday, Jellystone" party?
And they have doughnuts.
Doughnuts!
Yogi, what are you doing?
- Yogi!
- L'm going.
Hey.
Wait.
Don't do it, Yogi.
You promised Mr. Ranger.
You're right.
L'm losing control, Boo Boo.
I don't know who's steering the ship.
Here.
I want you to handcuff me to this tree and not unlock it no matter what I say.
Okay, Yogi.
- Okay, unlock me.
- Huh?
It was a bad idea.
Unlock me.
Unlock me!
Okay.
Here you go.
Folks, I hate to say this, but there are no spots left.
Forecast called for thunderstorms.
Severe lightning.
I fear for your young ones.
We're out of fireworks, I'm afraid.
It's just sparklers left.
Oh, no.
You look nice.
Your napkin matches your tie.
I don't need you to kiss up to me.
Got this guy for that.
That's a good point, sir.
You were gonna handle this situation, yet there are quite a few people here.
Sir, I tried.
All last night I spent taking down fliers.
I blocked the entrance with a vehicle to back up traffic.
I hung up "rabid squirrel" signs everywhere.
Those were hand-drawn.
- Nothing is working.
- You need to think of something, don't you?
Or maybe you're just not head ranger material.
Mr. Mayor.
Mayor's yes man.
So glad you could join us.
I saved you a nice spot next to the porta-potties.
Oh, well, thank you.
Well, that's very thoughtful.
You know, I'm just so glad that these festivities are going so well, Smith.
I just hope nothing goes wrong.
We are gonna pull this off, Jonesy.
I've seen hundreds of people filling out seasons pass order forms.
The weather's great.
The fireworks, ready to go.
Even Yogi's staying out of the way.
Yogi.
Hey, guys.
Sorry, just wandering around, bored out of my mind.
Bored?
But the 1 00th anniversary extravaganza's going on.
Yeah, more like 1 00th anniversary lame-aganza.
You know, because it's so lame.
People see fireworks every day in the city.
They thought they'd see something different here.
I knew it.
I should be out there doing my water-ski routine.
I'm a shining star and Ranger Smith is holding me back.
I don't know, Yogi.
Mr. Ranger is usually right about these things.
No, Boo Boo, Ranger Smith is in denial.
I mean, he's lost it, you know?
I saw him a couple days ago.
He was filling his pockets with dirt.
He said he's gonna start moving the park to his apartment piece by piece.
- How big is his apartment?
- There's still time.
I won't be able to do the half-hour artistic program but that was more for me anyway.
These people need the razzle-dazzle.
I don't think we've practiced the razzle-dazzle.
You're not supposed to, Boo Boo.
That's where it gets the razzle.
Yogi, I really don't think we should--
Boo Boo, you've tried to stop my brilliant ideas with common sense a thousand times.
Has it ever worked?
No.
Then let's go, go, go.
What does that taste like?
Unemployment?
- L'm sorry.
- Yeah.
Thanks again for helping with the fireworks.
I don't know where Jones disappeared to.
My pleasure.
You know, um, Rachel, I've been wanting to tell you...
- ...well, how much I--
- Ranger--
No, please, let me get through this.
I'm not very good with words.
But I have never felt so gushy.
Ha-ha-ha.
- You know?
- Ranger--
You know what I did?
I went and I wrote a song about you.
It's like this:
Oh, no.
L saw you at the station
Had a heart palpitation
My sickness was love And you're the medication
Rachel
- Rachel
- The microphone is on.
And it comes around again
Rachel, Rachel, Rachel
The microphone is on.
Yes, the mic--
Hi.
Hello and welcome to the 1 00th anniversary of Jellystone!
Thank you.
It is so wonderful to see so many people here today.
I've noticed many of you filling out your seasons pass order forms.
We're more than happy to collect those after the fireworks.
But first, please, sit back, get comfortable and enjoy the show!
- Terrific.
- Mr. Mayor?
That's not the right music.
I'll take it from here, Mr. Ranger!
Oh, no.
Full speed ahead, Boo Boo.
Okay.
Not bad, eh, Boo Boo?
Looking good, Yogi.
- This cannot be happening.
- Oh, it's happening.
Hello, Jellystone!
No, don't encourage him!
They love me.
L can do no wrong.
Watch this.
All right, Boo Boo!
Turn up the heat!
Phase two, go.
I'm an unstoppable water-skiing machine.
Ta-da!
Oh, wait.
There's more.
How about if I heat things up?
Don't need nothin' but a good time
And it don't get better than this
Yogi!
Yogi, your cape.
I know.
It is magnificent.
And on fire.
Huh?
Fire!
- Turn the boat!
- Huh?
- Turn, Boo Boo!
- Hang on, Yogi!
Too much razzle!
- Nice one.
- Thanks.
Jump!
Let's go.
Out of my way!
This could not have gone more perfectly.
Hey, you got a little, uh....
Never mind.
Let's go.
Mr. Ranger, I thought--
Yogi, that's the problem.
All the thinking.
Hey, you know what would be great?
If you didn't think.
If you could just be a regular bear.
You know, sitting in the woods, minding his own business.
But no, you're different.
You're smart.
And you'd rather spend your days being selfish and destructive while everyone else pays the price.
But I guess it wasn't enough, screwing up my life.
No, this time you had to go and bring down this entire park.
So tell me, Yogi how smart are you now?
Hey, there!
That was quite a show you put on yesterday.
Ha-ha-ha.
I can't wait to see what you do with this.
That's your new assignment.
Evergreen Park.
Oh, I think you're just going to find it delightful.
Oh, and, uh, Ranger Jones is gonna be taking over here.
Ranger Jones?
Well, I have got a press conference to plan.
You see, it turns out I've saved the city.
Don't forget to vote, my friend.
Brown for governor!
Ha-ha-ha.
He's not gonna vote for me, is he?
Uh, no.
You did everything you could.
Doesn't matter.
This park needed a ranger who could make it popular again.
I'm just some guy who knows how old every tree is.
Fat lot of good that did Jellystone.
Face it.
You and I are just two people who care about things that nobody else does and that's why we're alone.
Or maybe that's why we found each other.
Did you ever think of that?
Rachel, you and this park have one thing in common.
You both deserve a better man than me.
I can't believe he's really gone.
Yogi, are you okay?
I'm done being special, Boo Boo.
Ranger Smith was right.
My whole life, I've been different.
But it's done nothing but hurt people.
The world would be better off if I was only as smart as the average bear.
Yogi, what are you doing?
I'm leaving, Boo Boo.
- L am going to forage for food in the wild.
- Huh?
Might even catch some fish.
With my paws.
I'm just gonna grab a little something for the road.
Some chips and soda.
And this.
Peach pie.
Any more of that casserole?
Top shelf.
I'll be out there.
Fending for myself.
Foraging for food in the wild.
Goodbye, horsepower limiter.
There's a new head ranger in town.
Let's see what you got.
Perfect.
I'm sorry, Ranger Smith.
No more food.
No more pic-a-nickers.
How could this get any worse?
Oh.
Ah, Evergreen Park.
Yes, it is simply delightful.
- Come on.
- L've got it, sir.
This is unbelievable.
Ah, Evergreen Park.
Lovely, isn't it?
This isn't a park.
I can barely breathe in here.
Look at these trees.
They're all plastic.
Oh, no, they're real.
It's just years of smog and pollution have left a plastic-like coating on them.
Think people will be happy you're closing the most beautiful park in the state?
Well, they will be when they find out it's making the city rich and giving each citizen a check for $1000.
How is that even possible?
Oh, well, it turns out that there has been some agricultural interest in the park.
And it's a lot more profitable than people in station wagons making s'mores.
Have a good day, Ranger Smith.
I hate this car.
L hate it.
Yeah!
Oh, hey, there he is.
Ha-ha-ha.
Whoa, hey, Mr. Mayor!
I, uh....
Just finishing some stamping.
You are doing great, Jones.
I knew you were the guy for this job.
Quick thing.
You'll probably notice some giant trucks rumbling by.
We're just clearing a little patch of trees for my press conference.
No big deal.
Um, wait, you're cutting down trees?
Oh, yeah.
Well, just a few.
It's nothing to worry about.
Actually gonna improve the park quite a bit.
I'll bet one of the first things you noticed as head ranger is that you need more clear spaces here, and you are absolutely right.
Now you can host concerts and Boy Scout jamborees.
That's a pretty smart move there, Head Ranger Jones.
I have some other park improvements I want to run by you.
Oh, splendid, yes.
I think I have a few moments to hear those.
Look into the security arrangements for tomorrow.
I don't want any surprises.
I'll hear what Ding-Dong has to say.
What do you got?
I'm hungrier than the average bear.
I wish I could find a bush that tasted like birthday cake.
Gotcha.
Pretend it's a gummy worm.
Pretend it's a gummy worm.
Yogi, I've been looking everywhere for you.
Not now, Boo Boo.
I'm busy foraging.
Come on, Yogi.
Jellystone is in trouble.
We need your help.
Nothing I can do, Boo Boo.
I'm average now.
My brain is out of business.
I wouldn't even be standing if my paws didn't hurt.
Quit feeling sorry for yourself.
You know you're not an average bear.
Hey, hey, Boo Boo.
You're right, I'm not.
I failed at that too.
Hey, come back here.
You've gotta save Jellystone.
What are you doing?
L'm not--
Yogi, you have to use your smarts for good.
And if you can't see that, maybe you are just an average bear.
Come on.
Now do you understand?
What's going on, Boo Boo?
I don't know.
But whatever it is I think they're just getting started.
Boo Boo get my collar.
Nobody is gonna hurt Jellystone.
Where are we going, Yogi?
We can't get Jellystone back alone, Boo Boo.
My thinker is good, but Ranger Smith's is better.
He was going to a place called Evergreen Park.
That's right.
Ln the city.
The city?
That's a long walk.
Don't be silly, Boo Boo.
I've already got a smarty-smart cheat to keep our feet off the street.
Get ready for it.
Here it comes.
Run, Boo Boo, run!
Hurry, Boo Boo.
I think we gotta jump for it.
Ready?
All aboard.
Good.
Yogi, grab my paw.
Sorry.
Boo Boo, Boo Boo, Boo Boo!
I gotta get--!
I guess it makes a stop here.
Yup.
Looks like Evergreen Park is about two miles away from here.
Two miles?
L'll have to tap into my emergency rations.
Snack break.
Come on, Yogi.
We need to keep moving.
It's not that far and it's all downhill.
Downhill?
Excuse me, Mr. Dirty Shopper.
Any chance my friend and I might borrow your wheely-basket?
Is that chocolate?
Okay, Boo Boo, keep it steady.
I'm okay, Ma.
Just--
Yeah, no, it's not Jellystone, but at least there's nothing here to drive me crazy.
- Hey, Mr. Ranger.
- Hey, Yogi.
All right, Ma, I gotta call you back.
What are you guys doing here?
We need your help, Mr. Ranger, sir.
But don't worry, my days of goofing things up for you are over.
Hey, move that shopping cart!
I'm okay!
I'm just gonna put this over here.
What do you want?
L don't have a life left for you to ruin anymore.
Sir, I know I messed things up and I'm sorry.
I never meant to.
You and Boo Boo are the best friends I ever had.
And I've never done anything but think of myself.
And now Jellystone is just gonna be a big field of stumps.
What?
They've started cutting down the trees.
"Agricultural interest" is logging.
Oh, no, not our Jellystone.
We have to save it, sir.
I don't think we can save it, Yogi.
I'm no smarter than you.
I lost Jellystone.
I lost Rachel.
It's over.
Mr. Ranger, I've learned two things from stealing pic-a-nic baskets.
Light mayonnaise is not nearly as good as regular mayonnaise.
You can't fail if you never stop trying.
You have to fight for the things you love whether it's a park, a girl or a roast beef sandwich.
Don't give up now.
We're all Jellystone's got.
You're right, Yogi.
Jellystone's too important to give up on.
We gotta try.
Come on.
- Shotgun.
- Aw.
I never thought I'd see this.
Happy 1 00th anniversary, Jellystone.
Isn't that Miss Movie Lady?
L gotta get in there.
You don't understand.
Let me in, please.
No can do.
Park is closed to the public until the press conference.
Mayor's orders.
Then go talk to him.
Tell him what I told you.
I'm sorry.
I don't really take orders from a--
I lived with gorillas, pal.
I know rage.
You do not want me to go gorilla on you.
Uh, I'll speak to the mayor.
- Thank you.
- Okay.
Rachel.
Ranger Smith.
I didn't think I'd ever see you again.
I know.
I don't know what I was thinking.
I think you're perfect.
I think any guy in the world would be lucky just to stand next to you.
You really mean that?
Of course I do.
It's just, when I lost Jellystone, I felt like such a failure.
But losing you has felt much, much worse.
I'm like....
I'm like a genus without a phylum.
That's the sweetest thing anyone's ever said to me.
- So, um, we're still here.
- Mm-hm.
Oh, right.
Ahem.
So, what are you doing here?
- Come on, I'll show you.
- Okay.
I was reviewing the documentary footage from Boo Boo's camera and I saw this.
Oh, my.
I see it.
I have a bald spot back there!
I'm not talking about you, Yogi.
I'm talking about this.
Yeah, it's my pet turtle.
He hangs out at the cave all the time.
True.
You know they don't come out of that shell?
I tried one time to see what one would look like without it.
But, nope, they're sewn in.
This is no regular turtle.
See the bulging frog-like eyes and the really wide mouth?
A frog-mouthed turtle?
Yup, Rafetus swinhoei.
But those are extinct.
For a hundred years, but apparently one still exists.
And he lives in there.
But they won't let me through the gates to go find him.
But if Jellystone has an endangered species living in it, then--
It has to be protected as a park.
That's the law.
That turtle can save this park.
Now I feel kinda bad about using him as a foot stool.
You've seen the filmmaker?
Well, we spoke.
About extinct turtles.
You're telling me there is an extinct turtle living here in the park?
According to Miss Johnson's film, there is.
An extinct turtle?
That's great.
Visitors will come from miles around to see an endangered species.
Yes, they will, and that is great.
We need to find this turtle.
Just to keep it safe.
Have a vet check it out.
The whole deal.
The sooner we get to him the better.
Oh, we need a head ranger who's good enough to find it.
Someone who thinks like a turtle.
I am that head ranger.
Well, then why are you still here?
He's back.
Come on.
You need to let us in this park.
That turtle needs protection.
Don't worry about the turtle.
We're handling it.
We'll make sure he's put in a nice zoo.
No.
A turtle that's endangered can't be removed from its natural habitat.
It's against federal law.
It is?
Wow, I've never heard of that law in chapter 4, subsection 6 of the Wildlife Protection Mandate.
Don't worry, Mr. Ranger, sir.
That turtle is safe.
These people have no idea where my cave is.
The turtle's in the talking bear's cave.
Copy.
Wow, that backfired.
Okay.
You know what?
Fine,
You win.
What are you doing?
I have a plan.
One of the advantages of having lived here since I was a kid is I know this park like the back of my hand.
Let's go!
Hold on, boys.
All right.
Hey, there, little buddy.
Hello, there.
Uh-oh.
Sorry about that.
- Mayor Brown.
- This had better be good, Jones.
L found the turtle.
He was in Boo Boo's sleeping bag.
But now I have him secure at the picnic area.
Jones, you're a hero.
Sit tight.
My chief of staff is on his way to get him.
Copy that.
Head Ranger Jones over and out.
He found the turtle.
Dang it.
Can't cross those rapids.
There's no way to get to him from here.
Well, there is one way.
There it is.
My masterpiece.
- You really think you can pull this off?
- L know I can, sir.
I'm gonna snatch that basket-type turtle box and fly away like a fuzzy bird.
And I've got the best copilot a basket-snatching machine could have.
- L don't know how to fly this thing.
- Well, you'll pick it up as we go.
Okay.
Look, just be careful, okay, Yogi?
Copy that, ground control.
Basket-Nabber 2000 ready for takeoff.
- Flight systems check.
Boo Boo?
- What?
- Can you reach the pedals?
- Lf I point my toes.
Flight systems are go.
Remember what I told you about flying gliders, Yogi.
Don't fight the wind.
As long as the wind wants me to snatch up that turtle, we'll get along just fine.
- All right.
- Start pedaling, Boo Boo.
All right.
Here goes.
Hold on, Boo Boo.
Fasten your seat belt.
But there isn't one.
- Here we go!
- Oh, Yogi!
The wind should carry you south!
We'll meet you there!
Take your time, Mr. Ranger.
This machine is equipped with landing gear.
We'll touch down as soft as a feather.
Whoops.
This is your captain speaking.
We'll reach our turtle target in about two minutes.
So let's go ahead and start the beverage service.
- Yogi, look out.
- Aah!
- Trees!
- Yes, trees!
I got it.
I got it.
I got it.
I don't got it!
Pull up.
- Hey!
- Pull up!
You did it, Yogi.
Oh.
Yeah.
Ha-ha-ha.
Great job, Jones.
I'll get this guy to the city zoo.
- The city zoo?
- Yep.
They got a nice spot ready in the reptile house.
The city zoo doesn't have a reptile house.
They're building one.
- Who is?
- Builders.
Sure you're trying to protect the turtle?
Yeah, we love turtles.
Then you won't mind if I hold onto him until I notify the Wildlife Federation, right?
All right.
You're gonna find this out in a few hours anyway, so I might as well tell you.
We gotta lose this turtle to sell logging rights to the park.
Logging?
The whole park?
Yeah, but who cares?
It's still a park, just without trees.
And they'll grow back.
Yeah, in like 200 years.
It doesn't matter.
Your career is what matters.
Ha-ha-ha.
Turtle target acquired.
I need 20 more feet of altitude.
Engage the hand pedals.
You couldn't put the hand pedals by you?
There's a suggestion box behind the seat, Boo Boo.
Wait, you don't want to approach him like that.
He's poisonous.
He's in a basket.
But he can spit.
Poison.
He'll aim at your eyes.
Melt them out of your head.
- L'm telling you, that turtle is deadly.
- What are you looking at?
- Hook me in, Boo Boo.
- Okay.
And fire!
Here you go.
Huh?
Yogi, wait!
Here I come!
He's going for the turtle.
- Mind if I borrow this?
- Hey!
Look, Boo Boo!
We got the turtle!
Hey, why aren't you in your seat?
That bear knows how to steal a basket.
Everybody after that glider now!
I'm not gonna let a bear make me look bad.
Been there, buddy.
We're drifting too far right.
I wanna get us outside the park.
Don't fight the wind, Yogi.
Remember what Miss Movie Lady said about--
Never mind.
- Hang on, Boo Boo.
- What do we do now?
Did you check the safety manual?
It's just a picture of us screaming.
We've got to deject, Boo.
Don't you mean eject?
Eject is up.
Deject is down.
In case of emergency your seat can also be used as a flotation device!
Hey, told you.
Nothing to worry about.
I actually think I wasn't worried enough.
Let me see how our little passenger is doing.
Wonder why they call him a frog-mouthed turtle anyway?
Hey!
Hey, guys, over here!
Yogi, grab the branch.
Got you, Mr. Ranger, sir.
- Welcome aboard.
- Yogi.
We were trying to get you off the raft.
Yeah, that makes more sense.
You guys did it.
You saved him.
Oh, no.
They're gonna catch us downstream.
I'm on it.
No, Yogi, don't.
Problem solved.
They can't catch us now.
Yeah, because now we are headed straight for the Jellyjarring Rapids.
- Grab a paddle.
- Tuck your head in, little buddy.
Brace yourselves.
Oh, come on, turtle.
Don't worry, I put safety belts in this raft for just such an occasion.
You better hang on.
Mr. Ranger said--
We're gonna be fine, Boo Boo.
Just sit back and let Mother Nature carry us to--
I think Mother Nature's kind of cranky today.
You okay, Yogi?
Fine!
Turtle!
Who's that?
L can't see.
Come here, turtle.
- Got him.
- Good work, Boo Boo.
We made it through the rapids.
Yeah, but that means the falls are just up ahead.
Hold on!
Yogi.
Yogi.
Now who says there are no rides at Jellystone?
Yeah, you've definitely got the thrill part down.
Please, take your seats.
The press conference is about to begin.
That's over a mile away.
We're never gonna make that in time.
- Ranger Jones?
- L messed up pretty bad, sir.
- L know.
Lt's okay.
- L wanted to be head ranger.
Because you're a good head ranger and I value leadership.
I have a merit badge--
Can we talk later?
We're pressed for time.
Yes.
Get in.
Boo Boo!
Boo Boo!
Wait up!
Well, well.
Guess who we found.
Starts with T and ends with a-- "Urtle"?
It's over.
Call off the logging.
The law says this park is now a protected nature preserve.
You think I care about what the law says?
Or about some endangered "frog-mouthed turtle"?
Or some stupid park for families to have a picnic in?
I care about power, you pinheads!
And I'm gonna get it.
Nobody knows this turtle exists.
And nobody ever will.
You found the turtle.
Get this thing out of here before anybody else sees it.
- Rachel!
- Oh!
Yogi!
Yogi, here!
Thank you.
- Yogi.
- L'm sorry.
He was open.
Ha, ha.
Now if you'll excuse me, I have a press conference.
I can still tell them what you did.
Oh, yeah?
Without that turtle or a scrap of evidence, go right ahead.
Well, you might as well tell them Bigfoot is here.
Ha-ha-ha.
And do yourself a favor, there, ranger.
Try to keep your dignity.
It's all you have left.
You know what?
L'm taking care of this thing myself this time.
That's the only way to make sure the job is done right.
But that's why I'm the mayor's right-hand man, right?
Because I don't make mistakes.
Hey, you know, people are wondering:
"Why should I vote for Mayor Brown to be governor?"
Well, how about this:
Mayor Brown just turned the city's budget from a deficit into a surplus!
And put $1000 into the pocket of every citizen of this city!
Now before I sign the paperwork that will save the city why don't you all take a look at my first campaign ad for governor?
Mayor Brown, the right choice for governor.
We're out of time.
Must be something we can do.
Anybody have any ideas?
Well, I guess this is going to be a pretty sad documentary, huh?
Are you--?
Ls he still filming?
I needed more footage, so I told him to keep it rolling.
I can plug that into the video feed right up there.
I just need a way to distract the guards.
I think we can take care of that.
He supports public safety.
All right, hurry up, people.
Focus.
Let's go save those orphans.
Hey, hey, hey, check this out!
- Kick it, Boo Boo.
- Kicking it.
Don't stop believing
Hold on to that feeling
He's tough on crime.
Hey, hey, hey, look at this.
Keep your eye on the little bear.
Look at the skills.
Amazing!
And here's what Mayor Brown proudly has to say about protecting our natural resources.
You think I care about what the law says?
Or about some endangered "frog-mouthed turtle"?
- Some stupid park for families to picnic in?
- No.
No.
No.
L care about power, you pinheads!
Oh, boy.
Nobody knows this turtle exists.
And nobody ever will.
There's about to be a riot out there.
I need you out front.
Okay.
No.
Hey, wait.
Wait, wait, wait.
Please, please, please.
That was not real.
Trust me, there is no such thing as a frog-mouthed turtle.
He's right next to me, isn't he?
Okay.
- We did it, Yogi!
- Up high, Boo Boo!
- All right!
- We got it!
Yogi!
All right, and now....
Miss Moviemaker Lady.
Hey, we did it.
Hey, Mr. Ranger!
- Come on, Boo Boo.
- Okay.
I was wrong, Yogi.
I say from here on, we just be proud of who we are and fight for the things we're passionate about, like this park.
And Rachel.
And pic-a-nic baskets?
And pic-a-nic baskets.
- Aw, come here!
- No, you don't have to--
Okay.
All right, that's--
I'm good.
Here you go, Boo Boo.
Take good care of him.
Hey, there, buddy.
No, no, no, I never took a kickback on anything in my entire career.
No one loves turtles more than I do.
And nature in general.
L love trees.
Oh, no, you don't!
Gorilla?
Himalayan snow leopard.
Huh.
Welcome to Jellystone, home of the frog-mouthed turtle.
And brochures.
I'm Ranger Jones.
Ah, yes, Jellystone Park.
A wonderful little piece of paradise.
Where families come and soak up the tranquility of nature.
It's a place that--
Huh?
Never mind.
Hey, hey, hey!
Hi.
Welcome.
Well, I am certainly glad that you are gonna be staying in Jellystone for a while.
And what animal will you be observing?
Well, I thought I would observe the courting rituals of the American ranger.
I happen to hear the American ranger is a very charming intelligent, attractive species.
One that always keeps his cool.
Even when basket-stealing bears push his buttons?
Listen, Yogi will be Yogi.
And I'm just not gonna let it bother me anymore.
Besides I have more important things to focus on.
Oh....
I....
Let's-
- Let's try that again.
Afternoon, Mr. Ranger, sir!
Hi, Miss Movie Lady!
Yogi!
I love this place.
Yogi!
Hey!
Jellystone Park.
One of the nation's oldest and most beautiful stretches of wilderness.
For years, families have headed out from the busy city eager to enjoy a little camping, fishing and, of course, observing the park's natural wildlife.
Boo Boo, I think it's time I introduced myself to that pic-a-nic basket.
You know, Yogi, we could just hunt for food.
All the other animals do.
Boo Boo, a pic-a-nic basket has everything a bear needs.
And I'm not just talking about the treats and snack-type goodies.
No.
A pic-a-nic basket holds a lot more than that.
It holds dreams.
What are we looking at?
I don't know.
Hook me in.
You sure it'll work, Yogi?
Well, you know, Boo Boo, I'm smarter than the average bear!
All right!
Ranger Smith!
Sorry about that.
We got a 4-23 in Redwood Valley, sir.
- A what?
- A bear disturbance.
- I think it's probably...
- I know who it is.
Why didn't you just say "bear disturbance"?
Well, I...
Uh, well, it sounds cooler.
I mean, we're park rangers, sir.
You know:
"To protect and preserve."
Did you just make that motto up?
Yeah, I did.
Do you like it?
Ranger Jones, you know that, well, being a park ranger, it's not about mottos.
It's about keeping the park safe.
That's where the glory is.
Protecting all of this.
Yeah, I know.
Besides, that motto was still in the testing phase.
It's not like I made T-shirts or anything.
Heh, no, of course not.
Okay, I'm gonna deal with that 4-23.
Okay, copy that, sir.
Um, I'm actually gonna hop in the Armadillo, make some rounds.
Jones, you know that the Armadillo is for head ranger use only.
I might need it at any moment to deal with a park emergency.
Why don't you finish stacking those trail maps?
Yeah, sure.
Okay.
Yeah, because that's what future head rangers do, they stack maps.
Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy!
Our days of getting banged up to grab a meal are over, Boo Boo.
From now on, the pic-a-nic baskets are going to fall into our arms.
Soldering iron.
Here you go.
- Thank you.
Okay.
That should do it.
Test rock.
Okay, Yogi.
Weight sensor triggered.
Basket in position.
Launch spring starts coiling.
Firing pin drops.
And...
Bull's-eye!
I'm so smart it hurts!
You're standing on the soldering iron.
Or it's that.
Hot, hot, hot!
There's the test rock.
Now we just wait here for a pic-a-nic basket to fall into our arms.
Are you sure about this, Yogi?
People seem to get pretty mad when you...
A genius never questions his instincts, Boo Boo.
When you have a mind like mine you can't blink or you'll put a kink in your think.
Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.
We've got our first customers.
And they have pie!
I wonder what kind it is.
Yogi, are you out here?
- It's Mr. Ranger.
- Aah!
Get rid of the test rock.
Destroy the evidence.
I was never here.
Look...
Ow!
Hello, Mr. Ranger, sir.
Did you just...?
Did you guys...?
Did you...?
Oh, never mind.
Look, there was a complaint about a bear interfering with a family picnic.
I see.
And you'd like us to mount some sort of investigation?
No, I think it was you.
What?
!
How can you even think that?
Are you feverish?
Let me press my lips against your forehead.
Wait!
You're not pressing your lips against my forehead.
Hey, it's a lot better than the way they take my temperature.
No, look, Yogi, we've been over this many times.
Bears are supposed to avoid people, not run around stealing their food.
I agree, sir.
That's why my friend Boo Boo and I would never think of disturbing a family's pic-a-nic.
Huh.
It missed.
Good day, Mr. Ranger, sir.
We'll keep our eyes peeled.
I wonder if he noticed the pie.
Ra...
Smith.
You have a vis...
Over.
Didn't understand a word of that, Jones.
- Sorry.
Some lady's here to see you.
- Send her in.
- Okay.
I'll be in the Armadillo.
- Or you could be...
- Map stacking?
- Map stacking.
- Ranger Smith?
- Yes.
- Hello.
I'm Rachel Johnson.
- Hi.
I was hoping to talk to you about filming a documentary here.
Sure.
I can handle you for that.
Handle that for you.
Sorry.
My work isn't...
My brain isn't working right.
- I must have inhaled some jimsonweed.
- Oh.
Datura stramonium.
It's known to cause delirium cramping and nausea.
Heh.
- Cramping and nausea.
You've read The North American Wilderness Guide.
Yeah, I like to highlight all the plants and animals I see.
- I like to...
Me too.
- Ha, ha!
Yeah.
Ranger Smith.
At your service.
You want to film a documentary in Jellystone?
Yes.
I sent you a letter about a month ago.
- Written on a piece of bark.
- That was you!
Yes.
I'm sorry about that.
I was in Sumatra, living among the orangutans at the time and they get very nervous if they spot anything from the modern world.
Really?
Wow, that's amazing.
Then what did you use for ink?
Bird poop and spit.
Impressive.
So, what are you here to film?
Well, I was hoping to shoot a local species.
Something to really capture the beauty of a national park.
Terrific.
What animal were you thinking?
I heard you had an unusual brown bear.
- Brown bear?
- Yes.
One that talks?
Those are so rare.
- None that I can think of.
- Named Yogi?
Wears a hat and a tie?
No, that doesn't ring a bell.
I think he's standing on the roof, trying to steal your lunchbox.
I smell PB and J.
I'm all done.
Oh, right.
That Yogi.
Bankrupt?
No, no, no.
We're a city.
Cities don't go bankrupt.
They do when they're broke, sir.
We just have to find some money somewhere.
I'm about to run for governor.
How am I gonna do that when my own city is bankrupt?
Okay, yes.
Thank you.
- Here's the invoice, Mr. Mayor.
- Yikes!
Wow.
Ha.
I'm gonna pretend I didn't see that.
Just bill it to the city, okay?
Thank you.
Ugh.
How did we ever go so broke?
- I think we just spent too much.
- Hmm.
Is there anything we can sell?
You already sold the public golf course to condo developers two of the three fire stations to that frozen yogurt company.
You were selling the library, but it burned down.
Oh, yeah.
That was gonna be one of those make-your-own-doughnut places.
- No.
- Yeah.
- Lf you could dream it up, you could make it.
- Ah.
Love those.
We gotta think of something here.
Well, if we don't have anything to sell, maybe we can profit off what we can't sell.
I don't understand those words.
Like when we sold the bottling rights to the water in Lake Beuclair.
- We made a fortune.
- Yeah.
Sinkhole Beuclair is a great place to throw old mattresses.
- Oh, yeah.
- Hmm.
We just don't have any more resources to exploit.
Or do we?
Jellystone.
If we rezone Jellystone Park as agricultural land, we can sell the logging rights.
Here.
This company says they'll give us thousands of dollars an acre just to cut down the trees or something.
That'll be enough to balance the budget and give each citizen a big fat check.
You have any idea how many votes that'll buy me?
- Enough to be the next governor?
- Exactly.
You're fine, Yogi.
It's just a few scrapes and bruises.
I don't know, Mr. Ranger.
I'm pretty sure I heard my spine snap.
Well, you wouldn't be able to stand.
And you wouldn't be able to eat.
I'm okay!
Yogi, Boo Boo, I would like to introduce you to Rachel Johnson who's here to make a nature documentary.
What the heck was that?
I was saying hello.
I lived in a den with brown bears for six months.
Only bear I've ever lived with is Boo Boo.
And he only makes that sound after he's eaten baked beans.
Heh, heh.
I have problems with baked beans.
And for a little bear, he makes a lot of stink.
Okay, I have some fantastic river otters you can film instead.
- Could get a hat and tie on the slow one.
- No, you know, I really, really like these two.
- Would you guys mind if I shoot you?
Huh?
Yogi, I think she meant with a camera.
Yes.
Of course with a camera.
Heh-heh-heh.
I knew that.
But not just any camera.
This isn't gonna make me look fat, is it?
No, you are gonna look great.
Okay, just a few more adjustments.
Please, excuse the pre-tied bow tie.
My mornings are often rushed.
It's fine, Boo Boo.
This is going to be a whole new perspective for a documentary.
The Boo Boo cam will capture the true wilderness in all its natural glory.
No other human in sight.
That sounds like my apartment.
Ha, ha.
Uh, you know, because I live alone.
Well, plenty of women have tried to change that.
It's just, I haven't found one that...
- Likes you?
- What?
No.
No, that...
Will return your calls?
Can you stop helping, please?
Sir, I can see you like this lady.
But your courting rituals need work.
What you need to do is follow her around for two days making snorting sounds.
Then fight any male that looks at her.
And then, of course, urinate on her to mark her as your territory.
Works every time.
I got it under control, Yogi.
- Boo Boo, you're rolling.
- Cool.
Yogi Bear, a brown bear commonly found in North America and Alaska.
Weighing up to 1800 pounds, brown bears are also the national animal of Finland.
I don't think you have to narrate.
But I liked where you were going with it, Boo Boo.
- I was hooked.
- Really?
Yes.
Now try to film from flattering angles, if you know what I mean.
Pic-a-nic baskets may be delicious on the lips, but they're a lifetime on the hips.
Oh, no.
Ranger Smith!
Ranger Smith.
The mayor's here.
What's he doing here?
Why didn't he give us more warning?
I have to secure the area.
All units, lock down the park.
Repeat, lock down the park.
Jones, you know I'm the only other ranger here, right?
Yeah.
- Ranger Smith, we need to talk.
- You could've just called.
Yeah, but I thought this would be more friendly.
I'm really working on my people skills.
Anyway, I am closing your park down.
- Okay.
- What?
Oh, yeah, this place just costs the city way too much money.
Jellystone hasn't made its operating budget in 10 years.
You know, it's hard to compete with all those amusement parks...
Oh, hey, you're not kidding.
Oh, have you guys been to Lincoln Log Land yet?
Oh, man, they have got a roller coaster there, it's made completely out of logs.
It's just like they rode in the pioneer days.
It's unbelievable.
Sir, Jellystone is special.
Okay?
It's turning 100 years old this very year.
Why, it's a landmark.
I would never let it be closed down.
Well, uh, you actually don't have a choice.
Have you read the city bylaws lately?
Chapter 6.
Section 73.
"Any municipal property that can't generate enough money to cover its operating budget can be rezoned for other uses."
And since Jellystone loses money every year, we're shutting it down.
Uh, sorry?
- I thought that went well.
Yeah.
Just a second, Mr. Mayor.
Who says we can't cover our budget?
Park doesn't report earnings till next quarter.
Yeah, which is like one week away.
Come on, Smith.
You gotta be $20,000 in the hole.
We wish.
Yeah.
Try 30,562.
That's probably a couple hundred extra for the map stand.
I think it's confession time.
- I only pretended to fix it.
- Thanks, Jones.
Sounds like you're in pretty deep there, Smith.
Maybe we are.
But this is one of the last places families can go to be close to nature.
The world needs that.
Well, I'm not mayor of the world.
I'm mayor of this city.
And this city needs this park rezoned.
I'm sorry.
I feel awful about it.
Even though I look really good.
This is a new suit.
So, okay.
Maybe we don't have our operating budget today.
But you know what?
- A lot can happen in a week.
- All right.
Have it your way.
Take a week.
Hey, I'll even get you started.
What's the admission fee for one car again?
Four dollars.
Four dollars, huh?
Four whole dollars?
Well, that changes everything.
Oh, my goodness.
Well, I only need to come back in here like, uh, what, 10,000 more times?
In a week!
Do I have time for that?
- Impossible.
- Oh, shoot.
You want-a some-a lasagna?
You hungry, buddy?
Of course!
I'm always hungry.
I was talking to my pet turtle.
Here you go.
That better not be my beef jerky.
So, what's the big deal, Yogi?
This is the big deal, Boo Boo.
It's my masterpiece.
The Basket-Nabber 2000.
The most advanced pic-a-nic basket-stealing technology ever invented.
Wow.
Climb aboard.
This glider can steer dive, shoot rubber bands at pesky-type birds and even has an air bag.
Had an air bag.
Sorry, Yogi.
Not to worry.
We could cushion our landing with all the pic-a-nic baskets we swipe.
Now, how's that copilot seat feel?
A little wobbly, like it's not tied on very tight.
You won't feel that in the air.
Get ready to fly faster than the speed of sandwich, Boo Boo.
We're gonna break the pic-a-nic barrier.
Yogi!
- Uh-oh.
That's not his happy voice.
Don't move.
I'm switching the glider into stealth mode.
Stealth mode?
Wow.
How are you able to...?
Oh.
Ah, Mr. Ranger, sir.
Welcome.
Can I interest you in a sody pop?
- There you go.
- When did you steal our vending machine?
I, um...
I'm repairing it, sir.
This machine gives its sodas away for free when a bear kicks it.
Look, a camper has reported some missing fishing poles so I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say it was you.
Fishing poles?
Sir, I'm a bear.
If I wanted to catch fish, I would just use my...
Your paws, Yogi.
Isn't that kind of unsanitary?
What's that?
- What's what?
- That thing.
- What thing?
- The thing under the blanket.
- Blanket?
- The object right behind you.
Oh.
Oh, that.
Heh.
A sculpture.
I'm sculpting now.
Mostly landscapes.
And where's Boo Boo?
- France.
- What?
- That's not close by, is it?
- No.
Then he's in the bathroom.
- Excuse me.
- Wait!
Hey, this isn't the bathroom.
I'm telling you, Mr. Ranger, it's not for stealing pic-a-nic baskets.
It says "Basket-Nabber 2000" right here, Yogi.
I do regret calling it that now.
I know I'm always saying, "Stay away from the campers."
This is different.
Jellystone is in real trouble.
If I don't raise $30,000 in a week, this park's getting rezoned.
Rezoned?
What does that mean?
It means the park won't be a park anymore.
The city will use this land for something else.
So we have got to do everything we can to help save it.
Which means you have gotta stop stealing food so that campers will leave here happy.
But they do leave here happy.
Getting your food stolen by Yogi Bear is special.
People come here for that.
It's like catching a foul ball at a baseball game.
Nope.
It's like getting your food stolen at a baseball game.
Come on, Yogi.
Would it really be so hard to be a regular bear?
You know, to forage for food, to walk around on all fours to hibernate a little, or a lot.
If nature had meant for me to be a regular bear it wouldn't have given me such a good thought-cooker, sir.
I can't help it if my melon is full of smart juice.
Yogi, your melon is hurting this park.
There are repercussions to stealing people's picnic baskets.
Not in my experience, sir.
On the other hand...
Ranger Smith, mind if I borrow the 'dilla?
It's an emergency.
Somebody parked without parking decals.
Jones, I would really prefer it if you focused on just maintaining the park instead.
Let me deal with the visitors until you've had more experience.
Sorry, sir.
Guess that's just the Eagle Scout in me, you know?
Always wanting to be in control, be a leader.
Live up to this fanny pack full of merit badges.
You know that fanny pack is for first aid supplies, right?
A merit badge in first aid is the only supply I need, sir.
Right, but it might not be the only supply a hurt person needs.
You seen Rachel?
Yeah, I saw her.
She was heading up to Lookout Mountain.
She can't be far.
I'll drive.
Let's roll.
Jones.
The sprawling beauty of Jellystone Park.
A timeless stretch of wilderness untouched by man.
Oh.
Ranger Smith.
Wow, heh.
What's with the fancy outfit?
Dress greens.
I always wear dress greens in the evening.
You know, in case there's, you know...
- I don't know how to talk to girls.
- Oh.
Why do you think I spend so much time with animals?
All you have to do is scratch their backside and you've got a friend for life.
Try that with people and all of a sudden you're the weird girl on the bus that nobody wants to sit next to.
Um, uh, listen.
I was wondering, you know, if you were...
I mean, it's getting late and we could, uh...
If you want.
I mean, it's not that...
You don't...
It's...
You know, it's not a worry.
Don't worry.
Did you just ask me to dinner?
Yes.
I did.
Heh.
- Good, you got that, huh?
- Yes.
I just thought, well, it's getting late.
I happen to know this great place.
- Very gourmet.
- Really?
Where?
So close you won't believe it.
Wow, how did you ever find this place?
This is a four-star porch.
And fresh from the hot plate, I give you rack of Spam.
- Oh.
Wow.
Maybe "gourmet" was a bit of a stretch.
No, it actually looks wonderful.
Great.
You know, this really is a peaceful place.
It's something, isn't it?
I pretty much grew up here.
My father was a ranger when I was a kid and he turned this park into the number one tourist destination in the state.
I mean, it was a park, you know?
Like families came by the hundreds swam in the streams, hiked on the trails.
It was really something.
This is really good.
Anyway, I don't know.
Maybe it's my fault.
I spent so many years learning everything I could about the park so I'd be a better ranger.
Maybe instead, I should have come up with a gimmick to get people to come here.
You know, change the name to Extreme Jellystone.
- I think that it's perfect just the way it is.
- You do?
You're right.
Absolutely.
There's no better place on earth.
Hey, Mr. Ranger.
- Except a place without him.
Evening, Mr. Ranger, sir.
Madame Moviemaker Lady.
And yes, I'm using the fancy tense to show you the utmost respect.
Hi.
Ha, ha.
What do you want, Yogi?
Well, I was thinking about the park's prickly predicament and I would like to do my part to help.
This is all the money I have saved.
Almost $100.
I was going to use it on myself, but I'd rather donate it to Jellystone.
Well, thank you, Yogi.
That's...
That is very sweet.
- Where does a bear get money from?
- That brown box by the parking lot.
The park donation box.
Yep.
But I want you to have it.
Consider it a gift to Jellystone.
That won't be hard.
Look, guys, I appreciate the effort.
But what this park needs is visitors and lots of them.
Well, I can help you there, sir.
Just make me a headliner.
I will rock this place.
- Kick it, Boo Boo.
- Kicking it.
I like big butts and I cannot lie You other brothers can't deny
That when a girl walks in With a itty-bitty waist
And a round thing in your face You get sprung
That's not gonna work either, Yogi.
You're right.
We need something flashier than music.
Not a problem.
I've got this water-skiing routine that will change the face of entertainment.
Got a little of everything.
Music, stunts, magic.
- And I jump over Boo Boo at the end.
- No, you don't.
- I want to try it.
- I don't care.
I hate to interrupt, but you're not gonna water-ski or dance or do anything that might disturb the campers, okay?
If what you really want to do is help save this park you will lay low, stay away from people.
Think you can do that for me?
You have my word, Mr. Ranger.
I will be seen, but not heard.
Or seen.
Fine.
Huh?
You guys done with that Spam?
- Get out of here.
- Okay.
Sheesh!
Hey.
What's this?
Seasons pass applications.
Unfortunately, not a lot of takers on those.
Fifty bucks for an entire year?
Including camping fees?
That's a bargain.
If this were a place people wanted to visit throughout the year.
Maybe Yogi was on to something.
- You said the park was turning 100, right?
- Right.
Well, a big event could really pull people in.
Yeah, you're right.
We could have, like, a moss collection day or a big squirrel chase.
- Or...
- Fireworks.
Yes.
Exactly.
Why didn't I think of that?
We could host a big centennial festival.
People always show up for fireworks.
If even half of the people buy season passes the park makes enough money to stay open.
Right.
Let's get the word out.
I think I can help with that.
That is great.
How did we pay for it?
We didn't.
It was some fast-food restaurant but I rearranged the letters right before the plane took off.
You're very cool, Rachel Johnson.
You're pretty cool yourself.
I do have my own kind of natural swagger.
Jellystone National Park, 100th year anniversary.
There'll be fireworks.
Just stay calm, Jones.
You should be patrolling in the Armadillo making park-impacting decisions, but...
- Hey, 100th year anniversary.
- Thanks.
But you're not there yet.
You still have to follow orders.
Even if those orders make you look like a giant Cheez-It.
Mr. Mayor!
Hi, Mr. Mayor.
Why is it only going halfway down again?
Doesn't make any...
No!
Oh, okay.
Is it a double tap or do I have to press it...?
- Oh, dang it!
- I got it, sir.
Yeah.
That's exactly what I did.
Let me see one of those fliers.
"Come celebrate Jellystone's 100th anniversary with fireworks and fun."
"And receive $10 off a season pass"?
He's gonna try to make the budget selling season passes.
Yeah, ugh.
It's not a very good idea, in my opinion.
But nobody consulted me, because my job is just to maintain the park which is basically poking trash with a stick.
Yeah.
Yeah, why is a guy with your talent doing this insulting grunt work?
You should be running a park.
Yeah, but Ranger Smith says I have to pay my dues.
- Excuse me?
- What?
- He has to pay his dues?
Ha.
- Ha, ha.
Nobody pays dues anymore.
You gotta be in charge now while you still know everything.
- That's what I've been saying.
- Yeah.
Buddy, if it was up to me, you would be the head ranger of Jellystone already.
- You'd put me in charge?
- In a second.
Yes.
You know, if this centennial festival didn't work out, I probably could relocate Smith.
You know, uh, maybe you could help me with that.
Make sure it doesn't succeed?
Wait, you mean, like, sabotage it?
No.
Oh, no, no, no.
No, I want you to be head ranger.
It just so happens that the only way to do that is to bring down this festival.
But spend the rest of your life as second-in-command if you like.
That's fine.
It's a perfectly valid life choice.
Well, you just think about it and give me a call, okay?
Here's my card.
So long.
Hey.
Now why is it doing that?
No.
Boy Scouts are loyal, thrifty, kind...
Hey, you're back.
Hey, thanks for getting those fliers out.
Let me tell you, this festival is gonna be huge.
Hey, Ranger Smith, how long do you think until I reach head ranger status?
Oh, no time at all.
I did it in 12 short years.
Ha, okay.
Are you serious?
Just be patient, Jones.
It'll be here before you know it.
This festival's gonna be great!
I can't wait 12 years.
Seasons pass order forms.
Seasons pass order forms.
Thank you.
Seasons pass order forms, $10 off today.
Ah, enjoy.
I can't take it, Boo Boo.
Two days without a tasty treat to eat?
And I have to sit up here while they're having a "happy birthday, Jellystone" party?
And they have doughnuts.
Doughnuts!
Yogi, what are you doing?
- Yogi!
- I'm going.
Hey.
Wait.
Don't do it, Yogi.
You promised Mr. Ranger.
You're right.
I'm losing control, Boo Boo.
I don't know who's steering the ship.
Here.
I want you to handcuff me to this tree and not unlock it no matter what I say.
Okay, Yogi.
- Okay, unlock me.
- Huh?
It was a bad idea.
Unlock me.
Unlock me!
Okay.
Here you go.
Folks, I hate to say this, but there are no spots left.
Forecast called for thunderstorms.
Severe lightning.
I fear for your young ones.
We're out of fireworks, I'm afraid.
It's just sparklers left.
Oh, no.
You look nice.
Your napkin matches your tie.
I don't need you to kiss up to me.
Got this guy for that.
That's a good point, sir.
You were gonna handle this situation, yet there are quite a few people here.
Sir, I tried.
All last night I spent taking down fliers.
I blocked the entrance with a vehicle to back up traffic.
I hung up "rabid squirrel" signs everywhere.
Those were hand-drawn.
- Nothing is working.
- You need to think of something, don't you?
Or maybe you're just not head ranger material.
Mr. Mayor.
Mayor's yes man.
So glad you could join us.
I saved you a nice spot next to the porta-potties.
Oh, well, thank you.
Well, that's very thoughtful.
You know, I'm just so glad that these festivities are going so well, Smith.
I just hope nothing goes wrong.
We are gonna pull this off, Jonesy.
I've seen hundreds of people filling out seasons pass order forms.
The weather's great.
The fireworks, ready to go.
Even Yogi's staying out of the way.
Yogi.
Hey, guys.
Sorry, just wandering around, bored out of my mind.
Bored?
But the 100th anniversary extravaganza's going on.
Yeah, more like 100th anniversary lame-aganza.
You know, because it's so lame.
People see fireworks every day in the city.
They thought they'd see something different here.
I knew it.
I should be out there doing my water-ski routine.
I'm a shining star and Ranger Smith is holding me back.
I don't know, Yogi.
Mr. Ranger is usually right about these things.
No, Boo Boo, Ranger Smith is in denial.
I mean, he's lost it, you know?
I saw him a couple days ago.
He was filling his pockets with dirt.
He said he's gonna start moving the park to his apartment piece by piece.
- How big is his apartment?
- There's still time.
I won't be able to do the half-hour artistic program but that was more for me anyway.
These people need the razzle-dazzle.
I don't think we've practiced the razzle-dazzle.
You're not supposed to, Boo Boo.
That's where it gets the razzle.
Yogi, I really don't think we should...
Boo Boo, you've tried to stop my brilliant ideas with common sense a thousand times.
Has it ever worked?
No.
Then let's go, go, go.
What does that taste like?
Unemployment?
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah.
Thanks again for helping with the fireworks.
I don't know where Jones disappeared to.
My pleasure.
You know, um, Rachel, I've been wanting to tell you well, how much I...
- Ranger...
No, please, let me get through this.
I'm not very good with words.
But I have never felt so gushy.
Ha-ha-ha.
- You know?
- Ranger...
You know what I did?
I went and I wrote a song about you.
It's like this:
Oh, no.
I saw you at the station
Had a heart palpitation
My sickness was love And you're the medication
Rachel
- Rachel
- The microphone is on.
And it comes around again
Rachel, Rachel, Rachel
The microphone is on.
Yes, the mic...
Hi.
Hello and welcome to the 100th anniversary of Jellystone!
Thank you.
It is so wonderful to see so many people here today.
I've noticed many of you filling out your seasons pass order forms.
We're more than happy to collect those after the fireworks.
But first, please, sit back, get comfortable and enjoy the show!
- Terrific.
- Mr. Mayor?
That's not the right music.
I'll take it from here, Mr. Ranger!
Oh, no.
Full speed ahead, Boo Boo.
Okay.
Not bad, eh, Boo Boo?
Looking good, Yogi.
- This cannot be happening.
- Oh, it's happening.
Hello, Jellystone!
No, don't encourage him!
They love me.
I can do no wrong.
Watch this.
All right, Boo Boo!
Turn up the heat!
Phase two, go.
I'm an unstoppable water-skiing machine.
Ta-da!
Oh, wait.
There's more.
How about if I heat things up?
Don't need nothin' but a good time
And it don't get better than this
Yogi!
Yogi, your cape.
I know.
It is magnificent.
And on fire.
Huh?
Fire!
- Turn the boat!
- Huh?
- Turn, Boo Boo!
- Hang on, Yogi!
Too much razzle!
- Nice one.
- Thanks.
Jump!
Let's go.
Out of my way!
This could not have gone more perfectly.
Hey, you got a little, uh...
Never mind.
Let's go.
Mr. Ranger, I thought...
Yogi, that's the problem.
All the thinking.
Hey, you know what would be great?
If you didn't think.
If you could just be a regular bear.
You know, sitting in the woods, minding his own business.
But no, you're different.
You're smart.
And you'd rather spend your days being selfish and destructive while everyone else pays the price.
But I guess it wasn't enough, screwing up my life.
No, this time you had to go and bring down this entire park.
So tell me, Yogi how smart are you now?
Hey, there!
That was quite a show you put on yesterday.
Ha-ha-ha.
I can't wait to see what you do with this.
That's your new assignment.
Evergreen Park.
Oh, I think you're just going to find it delightful.
Oh, and, uh, Ranger Jones is gonna be taking over here.
Ranger Jones?
Well, I have got a press conference to plan.
You see, it turns out I've saved the city.
Don't forget to vote, my friend.
Brown for governor!
Ha-ha-ha.
He's not gonna vote for me, is he?
Uh, no.
You did everything you could.
Doesn't matter.
This park needed a ranger who could make it popular again.
I'm just some guy who knows how old every tree is.
Fat lot of good that did Jellystone.
Face it.
You and I are just two people who care about things that nobody else does and that's why we're alone.
Or maybe that's why we found each other.
Did you ever think of that?
Rachel, you and this park have one thing in common.
You both deserve a better man than me.
I can't believe he's really gone.
Yogi, are you okay?
I'm done being special, Boo Boo.
Ranger Smith was right.
My whole life, I've been different.
But it's done nothing but hurt people.
The world would be better off if I was only as smart as the average bear.
Yogi, what are you doing?
I'm leaving, Boo Boo.
- I am going to forage for food in the wild.
- Huh?
Might even catch some fish.
With my paws.
I'm just gonna grab a little something for the road.
Some chips and soda.
And this.
Peach pie.
Any more of that casserole?
Top shelf.
I'll be out there.
Fending for myself.
Foraging for food in the wild.
Goodbye, horsepower limiter.
There's a new head ranger in town.
Let's see what you got.
Perfect.
I'm sorry, Ranger Smith.
No more food.
No more pic-a-nickers.
How could this get any worse?
Oh.
Ah, Evergreen Park.
Yes, it is simply delightful.
- Come on.
- I've got it, sir.
This is unbelievable.
Ah, Evergreen Park.
Lovely, isn't it?
This isn't a park.
I can barely breathe in here.
Look at these trees.
They're all plastic.
Oh, no, they're real.
It's just years of smog and pollution have left a plastic-like coating on them.
Think people will be happy you're closing the most beautiful park in the state?
Well, they will be when they find out it's making the city rich and giving each citizen a check for $1000.
How is that even possible?
Oh, well, it turns out that there has been some agricultural interest in the park.
And it's a lot more profitable than people in station wagons making s'mores.
Have a good day, Ranger Smith.
I hate this car.
I hate it.
Yeah!
Oh, hey, there he is.
Ha-ha-ha.
Whoa, hey, Mr. Mayor!
I, uh...
Just finishing some stamping.
You are doing great, Jones.
I knew you were the guy for this job.
Quick thing.
You'll probably notice some giant trucks rumbling by.
We're just clearing a little patch of trees for my press conference.
No big deal.
Um, wait, you're cutting down trees?
Oh, yeah.
Well, just a few.
It's nothing to worry about.
Actually gonna improve the park quite a bit.
I'll bet one of the first things you noticed as head ranger is that you need more clear spaces here, and you are absolutely right.
Now you can host concerts and Boy Scout jamborees.
That's a pretty smart move there, Head Ranger Jones.
I have some other park improvements I want to run by you.
Oh, splendid, yes.
I think I have a few moments to hear those.
Look into the security arrangements for tomorrow.
I don't want any surprises.
I'll hear what Ding-Dong has to say.
What do you got?
I'm hungrier than the average bear.
I wish I could find a bush that tasted like birthday cake.
Gotcha.
Pretend it's a gummy worm.
Pretend it's a gummy worm.
Yogi, I've been looking everywhere for you.
Not now, Boo Boo.
I'm busy foraging.
Come on, Yogi.
Jellystone is in trouble.
We need your help.
Nothing I can do, Boo Boo.
I'm average now.
My brain is out of business.
I wouldn't even be standing if my paws didn't hurt.
Quit feeling sorry for yourself.
You know you're not an average bear.
Hey, hey, Boo Boo.
You're right, I'm not.
I failed at that too.
Hey, come back here.
You've gotta save Jellystone.
What are you doing?
I'm not...
Yogi, you have to use your smarts for good.
And if you can't see that, maybe you are just an average bear.
Come on.
Now do you understand?
What's going on, Boo Boo?
I don't know.
But whatever it is I think they're just getting started.
Boo Boo get my collar.
Nobody is gonna hurt Jellystone.
Where are we going, Yogi?
We can't get Jellystone back alone, Boo Boo.
My thinker is good, but Ranger Smith's is better.
He was going to a place called Evergreen Park.
That's right.
In the city.
The city?
That's a long walk.
Don't be silly, Boo Boo.
I've already got a smarty-smart cheat to keep our feet off the street.
Get ready for it.
Here it comes.
Run, Boo Boo, run!
Hurry, Boo Boo.
I think we gotta jump for it.
Ready?
All aboard.
Good.
Yogi, grab my paw.
Sorry.
Boo Boo, Boo Boo, Boo Boo!
I gotta get...!
I guess it makes a stop here.
Yup.
Looks like Evergreen Park is about two miles away from here.
Two miles?
I'll have to tap into my emergency rations.
Snack break.
Come on, Yogi.
We need to keep moving.
It's not that far and it's all downhill.
Downhill?
Excuse me, Mr. Dirty Shopper.
Any chance my friend and I might borrow your wheely-basket?
Is that chocolate?
Okay, Boo Boo, keep it steady.
I'm okay, Ma.
Just...
Yeah, no, it's not Jellystone, but at least there's nothing here to drive me crazy.
- Hey, Mr. Ranger.
- Hey, Yogi.
All right, Ma, I gotta call you back.
What are you guys doing here?
We need your help, Mr. Ranger, sir.
But don't worry, my days of goofing things up for you are over.
Hey, move that shopping cart!
I'm okay!
I'm just gonna put this over here.
What do you want?
I don't have a life left for you to ruin anymore.
Sir, I know I messed things up and I'm sorry.
I never meant to.
You and Boo Boo are the best friends I ever had.
And I've never done anything but think of myself.
And now Jellystone is just gonna be a big field of stumps.
What?
They've started cutting down the trees.
"Agricultural interest" is logging.
Oh, no, not our Jellystone.
We have to save it, sir.
I don't think we can save it, Yogi.
I'm no smarter than you.
I lost Jellystone.
I lost Rachel.
It's over.
Mr. Ranger, I've learned two things from stealing pic-a-nic baskets.
Light mayonnaise is not nearly as good as regular mayonnaise.
You can't fail if you never stop trying.
You have to fight for the things you love whether it's a park, a girl or a roast beef sandwich.
Don't give up now.
We're all Jellystone's got.
You're right, Yogi.
Jellystone's too important to give up on.
We gotta try.
Come on.
- Shotgun.
- Aw.
I never thought I'd see this.
Happy 100th anniversary, Jellystone.
Isn't that Miss Movie Lady?
I gotta get in there.
You don't understand.
Let me in, please.
No can do.
Park is closed to the public until the press conference.
Mayor's orders.
Then go talk to him.
Tell him what I told you.
I'm sorry.
I don't really take orders from a...
I lived with gorillas, pal.
I know rage.
You do not want me to go gorilla on you.
Uh, I'll speak to the mayor.
- Thank you.
- Okay.
Rachel.
Ranger Smith.
I didn't think I'd ever see you again.
I know.
I don't know what I was thinking.
I think you're perfect.
I think any guy in the world would be lucky just to stand next to you.
You really mean that?
Of course I do.
It's just, when I lost Jellystone, I felt like such a failure.
But losing you has felt much, much worse.
I'm like...
I'm like a genus without a phylum.
That's the sweetest thing anyone's ever said to me.
- So, um, we're still here.
Mm-hm.
Oh, right.
Ahem.
So, what are you doing here?
- Come on, I'll show you.
- Okay.
I was reviewing the documentary footage from Boo Boo's camera and I saw this.
Oh, my.
I see it.
I have a bald spot back there!
I'm not talking about you, Yogi.
I'm talking about this.
Yeah, it's my pet turtle.
He hangs out at the cave all the time.
True.
You know they don't come out of that shell?
I tried one time to see what one would look like without it.
But, nope, they're sewn in.
This is no regular turtle.
See the bulging frog-like eyes and the really wide mouth?
A frog-mouthed turtle?
Yup, Rafetus swinhoei.
But those are extinct.
For a hundred years, but apparently one still exists.
And he lives in there.
But they won't let me through the gates to go find him.
But if Jellystone has an endangered species living in it, then...
It has to be protected as a park.
That's the law.
That turtle can save this park.
Now I feel kinda bad about using him as a foot stool.
You've seen the filmmaker?
Well, we spoke.
About extinct turtles.
You're telling me there is an extinct turtle living here in the park?
According to Miss Johnson's film, there is.
An extinct turtle?
That's great.
Visitors will come from miles around to see an endangered species.
Yes, they will, and that is great.
We need to find this turtle.
Just to keep it safe.
Have a vet check it out.
The whole deal.
The sooner we get to him the better.
Oh, we need a head ranger who's good enough to find it.
Someone who thinks like a turtle.
I am that head ranger.
Well, then why are you still here?
He's back.
Come on.
You need to let us in this park.
That turtle needs protection.
Don't worry about the turtle.
We're handling it.
We'll make sure he's put in a nice zoo.
No.
A turtle that's endangered can't be removed from its natural habitat.
It's against federal law.
It is?
Wow, I've never heard of that law in chapter 4, subsection 6 of the Wildlife Protection Mandate.
Don't worry, Mr. Ranger, sir.
That turtle is safe.
These people have no idea where my cave is.
The turtle's in the talking bear's cave.
Copy.
Wow, that backfired.
Okay.
You know what?
Fine,
You win.
What are you doing?
I have a plan.
One of the advantages of having lived here since I was a kid is I know this park like the back of my hand.
Let's go!
Hold on, boys.
All right.
Hey, there, little buddy.
Hello, there.
Uh-oh.
Sorry about that.
- Mayor Brown.
- This had better be good, Jones.
I found the turtle.
He was in Boo Boo's sleeping bag.
But now I have him secure at the picnic area.
Jones, you're a hero.
Sit tight.
My chief of staff is on his way to get him.
Copy that.
Head Ranger Jones over and out.
He found the turtle.
Dang it.
Can't cross those rapids.
There's no way to get to him from here.
Well, there is one way.
There it is.
My masterpiece.
- You really think you can pull this off?
- I know I can, sir.
I'm gonna snatch that basket-type turtle box and fly away like a fuzzy bird.
And I've got the best copilot a basket-snatching machine could have.
- I don't know how to fly this thing.
- Well, you'll pick it up as we go.
Okay.
Look, just be careful, okay, Yogi?
Copy that, ground control.
Basket-Nabber 2000 ready for takeoff.
- Flight systems check.
Boo Boo?
- What?
- Can you reach the pedals?
- Lf I point my toes.
Flight systems are go.
Remember what I told you about flying gliders, Yogi.
Don't fight the wind.
As long as the wind wants me to snatch up that turtle, we'll get along just fine.
- All right.
Start pedaling, Boo Boo.
All right.
Here goes.
Hold on, Boo Boo.
Fasten your seat belt.
But there isn't one.
Here we go!
Oh, Yogi!
The wind should carry you south!
We'll meet you there!
Take your time, Mr. Ranger.
This machine is equipped with landing gear.
We'll touch down as soft as a feather.
Whoops.
This is your captain speaking.
We'll reach our turtle target in about two minutes.
So let's go ahead and start the beverage service.
- Yogi, look out.
- Aah!
- Trees!
- Yes, trees!
I got it.
I got it.
I got it.
I don't got it!
Pull up.
- Hey!
- Pull up!
You did it, Yogi.
Oh.
Yeah.
Ha-ha-ha.
Great job, Jones.
I'll get this guy to the city zoo.
- The city zoo?
- Yep.
They got a nice spot ready in the reptile house.
The city zoo doesn't have a reptile house.
They're building one.
- Who is?
- Builders.
Sure you're trying to protect the turtle?
Yeah, we love turtles.
Then you won't mind if I hold onto him until I notify the Wildlife Federation, right?
All right.
You're gonna find this out in a few hours anyway, so I might as well tell you.
We gotta lose this turtle to sell logging rights to the park.
Logging?
The whole park?
Yeah, but who cares?
It's still a park, just without trees.
And they'll grow back.
Yeah, in like 200 years.
It doesn't matter.
Your career is what matters.
Ha-ha-ha.
Turtle target acquired.
I need 20 more feet of altitude.
Engage the hand pedals.
You couldn't put the hand pedals by you?
There's a suggestion box behind the seat, Boo Boo.
Wait, you don't want to approach him like that.
He's poisonous.
He's in a basket.
But he can spit.
Poison.
He'll aim at your eyes.
Melt them out of your head.
- I'm telling you, that turtle is deadly.
- What are you looking at?
- Hook me in, Boo Boo.
- Okay.
And fire!
Here you go.
Huh?
Yogi, wait!
Here I come!
He's going for the turtle.
- Mind if I borrow this?
- Hey!
Look, Boo Boo!
We got the turtle!
Hey, why aren't you in your seat?
That bear knows how to steal a basket.
Everybody after that glider now!
I'm not gonna let a bear make me look bad.
Been there, buddy.
We're drifting too far right.
I wanna get us outside the park.
Don't fight the wind, Yogi.
Remember what Miss Movie Lady said about...
Never mind.
Hang on, Boo Boo.
- What do we do now?
Did you check the safety manual?
It's just a picture of us screaming.
We've got to deject, Boo.
Don't you mean eject?
Eject is up.
Deject is down.
In case of emergency your seat can also be used as a flotation device!
Hey, told you.
Nothing to worry about.
I actually think I wasn't worried enough.
Let me see how our little passenger is doing.
Wonder why they call him a frog-mouthed turtle anyway?
Hey!
Hey, guys, over here!
Yogi, grab the branch.
Got you, Mr. Ranger, sir.
- Welcome aboard.
Yogi.
We were trying to get you off the raft.
Yeah, that makes more sense.
You guys did it.
You saved him.
Oh, no.
They're gonna catch us downstream.
I'm on it.
No, Yogi, don't.
Problem solved.
They can't catch us now.
Yeah, because now we are headed straight for the Jellyjarring Rapids.
- Grab a paddle.
- Tuck your head in, little buddy.
Brace yourselves.
Oh, come on, turtle.
Don't worry, I put safety belts in this raft for just such an occasion.
You better hang on.
Mr. Ranger said...
We're gonna be fine, Boo Boo.
Just sit back and let Mother Nature carry us to...
I think Mother Nature's kind of cranky today.
You okay, Yogi?
Fine!
Turtle!
Who's that?
I can't see.
Come here, turtle.
- Got him.
Good work, Boo Boo.
We made it through the rapids.
Yeah, but that means the falls are just up ahead.
Hold on!
Yogi.
Yogi.
Now who says there are no rides at Jellystone?
Yeah, you've definitely got the thrill part down.
Please, take your seats.
The press conference is about to begin.
That's over a mile away.
We're never gonna make that in time.
- Ranger Jones?
- I messed up pretty bad, sir.
- I know.
It's okay.
- I wanted to be head ranger.
Because you're a good head ranger and I value leadership.
I have a merit badge...
Can we talk later?
We're pressed for time.
Yes.
Get in.
Boo Boo!
Boo Boo!
Wait up!
Well, well.
Guess who we found.
Starts with T and ends with a..."Urtle"?
It's over.
Call off the logging.
The law says this park is now a protected nature preserve.
You think I care about what the law says?
Or about some endangered "frog-mouthed turtle"?
Or some stupid park for families to have a picnic in?
I care about power, you pinheads!
And I'm gonna get it.
Nobody knows this turtle exists.
And nobody ever will.
You found the turtle.
Get this thing out of here before anybody else sees it.
- Rachel!
- Oh!
Yogi!
Yogi, here!
Thank you.
- Yogi.
- I'm sorry.
He was open.
Ha, ha.
Now if you'll excuse me, I have a press conference.
I can still tell them what you did.
Oh, yeah?
Without that turtle or a scrap of evidence, go right ahead.
Well, you might as well tell them Bigfoot is here.
Ha-ha-ha.
And do yourself a favor, there, ranger.
Try to keep your dignity.
It's all you have left.
You know what?
I'm taking care of this thing myself this time.
That's the only way to make sure the job is done right.
But that's why I'm the mayor's right-hand man, right?
Because I don't make mistakes.
Hey, you know, people are wondering:
"Why should I vote for Mayor Brown to be governor?"
Well, how about this:
Mayor Brown just turned the city's budget from a deficit into a surplus!
And put $1000 into the pocket of every citizen of this city!
Now before I sign the paperwork that will save the city why don't you all take a look at my first campaign ad for governor?
Mayor Brown, the right choice for governor.
We're out of time.
Must be something we can do.
Anybody have any ideas?
Well, I guess this is going to be a pretty sad documentary, huh?
Are you...?
Is he still filming?
I needed more footage, so I told him to keep it rolling.
I can plug that into the video feed right up there.
I just need a way to distract the guards.
I think we can take care of that.
He supports public safety.
All right, hurry up, people.
Focus.
Let's go save those orphans.
Hey, hey, hey, check this out!
- Kick it, Boo Boo.
- Kicking it.
Don't stop believing
Hold on to that feeling
He's tough on crime.
Hey, hey, hey, look at this.
Keep your eye on the little bear.
Look at the skills.
Amazing!
And here's what Mayor Brown proudly has to say about protecting our natural resources.
You think I care about what the law says?
Or about some endangered "frog-mouthed turtle"?
- Some stupid park for families to picnic in?
- No.
No.
No.
I care about power, you pinheads!
Oh, boy.
Nobody knows this turtle exists.
And nobody ever will.
There's about to be a riot out there.
I need you out front.
Okay.
No.
Hey, wait.
Wait, wait, wait.
Please, please, please.
That was not real.
Trust me, there is no such thing as a frog-mouthed turtle.
He's right next to me, isn't he?
Okay.
- We did it, Yogi!
- Up high, Boo Boo!
- All right!
We got it!
Yogi!
All right, and now...
Miss Moviemaker Lady.
Hey, we did it.
Hey, Mr. Ranger!
Come on, Boo Boo.
- Okay.
I was wrong, Yogi.
I say from here on, we just be proud of who we are and fight for the things we're passionate about, like this park.
And Rachel.
And pic-a-nic baskets?
And pic-a-nic baskets.
- Aw, come here!
- No, you don't have to...
Okay.
All right, that's...
I'm good.
Here you go, Boo Boo.
Take good care of him.
Hey, there, buddy.
No, no, no, I never took a kickback on anything in my entire career.
No one loves turtles more than I do.
And nature in general.
I love trees.
Oh, no, you don't!
Gorilla?
Himalayan snow leopard.
Huh.
Welcome to Jellystone, home of the frog-mouthed turtle.
And brochures.
I'm Ranger Jones.
Ah, yes, Jellystone Park.
A wonderful little piece of paradise.
Where families come and soak up the tranquility of nature.
It's a place that...
Huh?
Never mind.
Hey, hey, hey!
Hi.
Welcome.
Well, I am certainly glad that you are gonna be staying in Jellystone for a while.
And what animal will you be observing?
Well, I thought I would observe the courting rituals of the American ranger.
I happen to hear the American ranger is a very charming intelligent, attractive species.
One that always keeps his cool.
Even when basket-stealing bears push his buttons?
Listen, Yogi will be Yogi.
And I'm just not gonna let it bother me anymore.
Besides I have more important things to focus on.
Oh...
I...
Let's...
Let's try that again.
Afternoon, Mr. Ranger, sir!
Hi, Miss Movie Lady!
Yogi!
I love this place.
Yogi!
Hey!
NARRATOR:
Jellystone Park.
One of the nation's oldest and most beautiful stretches of wilderness.
For years, families have headed out from the busy city eager to enjoy a little camping, fishing and, of course, observing the park's natural wildlife.
Boo Boo, I think it's time I introduced myself to that pic-a-nic basket.
You know, Yogi, we could just hunt for food.
All the other animals do.
Boo Boo, a pic-a-nic basket has everything a bear needs.
And I'm not just talking about the treats and snack-type goodies.
No.
A pic-a-nic basket holds a lot more than that.
It holds dreams.
[WHISPERING] What are we looking at?
I don't know.
Hook me in.
[IN NORMAL VOICE] You sure it'll work, Yogi?
Well, you know, Boo Boo, I'm smarter than the average bear!
[SHOUTING]
[CHUCKLING]
All right!
[GASPS]
[SHOUTING]
[GRUNTS]
[CHUCKLING]
[GROANS]
MAN:
Ranger Smith!
Sorry about that.
We got a 4-23 in Redwood Valley, sir.
-A what?
-A bear disturbance.
-I think it's probably--
-I know who it is.
Why didn't you just say "bear disturbance"?
Well, I....
Uh, well, it sounds cooler.
I mean, we're park rangers, sir.
You know:
"To protect and preserve."
Did you just make that motto up?
Yeah, I did.
Do you like it?
Ranger Jones, you know that, well, being a park ranger, it's not about mottos.
It's about keeping the park safe.
That's where the glory is.
Protecting all of this.
Yeah, I know.
Besides, that motto was still in the testing phase.
It's not like I made T-shirts or anything.
Heh, no, of course not.
Okay, I'm gonna deal with that 4-23.
Okay, copy that, sir.
Um, I'm actually gonna hop in the Armadillo, make some rounds.
Jones, you know that the Armadillo is for head ranger use only.
I might need it at any moment to deal with a park emergency.
Why don't you finish stacking those trail maps?
Yeah, sure.
Okay.
Yeah, because that's what future head rangers do, they stack maps.
Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy!
Our days of getting banged up to grab a meal are over, Boo Boo.
From now on, the pic-a-nic baskets are going to fall into our arms.
Soldering iron.
BOO BOO:
Here you go.
-Thank you.
Okay.
That should do it.
Test rock.
Okay, Yogi.
YOGI:
Weight sensor triggered.
Basket in position.
Launch spring starts coiling.
Firing pin drops.
And....
[BELL RINGS]
Bull's-eye!
I'm so smart it hurts!
You're standing on the soldering iron.
Or it's that.
[SHOUTING]
Hot, hot, hot!
There's the test rock.
Now we just wait here for a pic-a-nic basket to fall into our arms.
Are you sure about this, Yogi?
People seem to get pretty mad when you--
A genius never questions his instincts, Boo Boo.
When you have a mind like mine you can't blink or you'll put a kink in your think.
Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.
We've got our first customers.
And they have pie!
I wonder what kind it is.
SMITH:
Yogi, are you out here?
-It's Mr. Ranger.
-Aah!
Get rid of the test rock.
Destroy the evidence.
I was never here.
SMITH:
Look-
- Ow!
Hello, Mr. Ranger, sir.
Did you just--?
Did you guys--?
Did you--?
Oh, never mind.
Look, there was a complaint about a bear interfering with a family picnic.
I see.
And you'd like us to mount some sort of investigation?
No, I think it was you.
What?
!
How can you even think that?
Are you feverish?
Let me press my lips against your forehead.
Wait!
You're not pressing your lips against my forehead.
Hey, it's a lot better than the way they take my temperature.
[CHUCKLES]
No, look, Yogi, we've been over this many times.
Bears are supposed to avoid people, not run around stealing their food.
I agree, sir.
That's why my friend Boo Boo and I would never think of disturbing a family's pic-a-nic.
[BELL RINGS AND WOOD CLUNKS]
[WOMAN SCREAMS]
Huh.
It missed.
[GROANS]
Good day, Mr. Ranger, sir.
We'll keep our eyes peeled.
I wonder if he noticed the pie.
JONES [CHOPPY OVER RADIO]:
Ra-
- Smith.
You have a vis-
- Over.
Didn't understand a word of that, Jones.
-Sorry.
Some lady's here to see you.
-Send her in.
-Okay.
I'll be in the Armadillo.
-Or you could be....
-Map stacking?
-Map stacking.
-Ranger Smith?
-Yes.
-Hello.
I'm Rachel Johnson.
-Hi.
I was hoping to talk to you about filming a documentary here.
Sure.
I can handle you for that.
Handle that for you.
Sorry.
My work isn't-- My brain isn't working right.
-I must have inhaled some jimsonweed.
-Oh.
Datura stramonium.
It's known to cause delirium...
-...cramping and nausea.
Heh.
-Cramping and nausea.
You've read The North American Wilderness Guide.
Yeah, I like to highlight all the plants and animals I see.
-I like to-
- Me too.
-Ha, ha!
Yeah.
[SMITH STAMMERING]
Ranger Smith.
At your service.
You want to film a documentary in Jellystone?
Yes.
I sent you a letter about a month ago.
-Written on a piece of bark.
-That was you!
Yes.
I'm sorry about that.
I was in Sumatra, living among the orangutans at the time and they get very nervous if they spot anything from the modern world.
Really?
Wow, that's amazing.
Then what did you use for ink?
Bird poop and spit.
Impressive.
So, what are you here to film?
Well, I was hoping to shoot a local species.
Something to really capture the beauty of a national park.
Terrific.
What animal were you thinking?
I heard you had an unusual brown bear.
-Brown bear?
-Yes.
One that talks?
Those are so rare.
-None that I can think of.
-Named Yogi?
Wears a hat and a tie?
No, that doesn't ring a bell.
I think he's standing on the roof, trying to steal your lunchbox.
YOGI:
I smell PB and J.
[YOGI SHOUTING]
I'm all done.
Oh, right.
That Yogi.
Bankrupt?
No, no, no.
We're a city.
Cities don't go bankrupt.
They do when they're broke, sir.
We just have to find some money somewhere.
I'm about to run for governor.
How am I gonna do that when my own city is bankrupt?
Okay, yes.
Thank you.
-Here's the invoice, Mr. Mayor.
-Yikes!
Wow.
Ha.
I'm gonna pretend I didn't see that.
Just bill it to the city, okay?
Thank you.
Ugh.
How did we ever go so broke?
-I think we just spent too much.
-Hmm.
Is there anything we can sell?
You already sold the public golf course to condo developers two of the three fire stations to that frozen yogurt company.
You were selling the library, but it burned down.
Oh, yeah.
That was gonna be one of those make-your-own-doughnut places.
-No.
-Yeah.
-If you could dream it up, you could make it.
-Ah.
Love those.
We gotta think of something here.
Well, if we don't have anything to sell, maybe we can profit off what we can't sell.
I don't understand those words.
Like when we sold the bottling rights to the water in Lake Beuclair.
-We made a fortune.
-Yeah.
Sinkhole Beuclair is a great place to throw old mattresses.
-Oh, yeah.
-Hmm.
We just don't have any more resources to exploit.
Or do we?
Jellystone.
If we rezone Jellystone Park as agricultural land, we can sell the logging rights.
Here.
This company says they'll give us thousands of dollars an acre just to cut down the trees or something.
That'll be enough to balance the budget and give each citizen a big fat check.
[LAUGHING]
You have any idea how many votes that'll buy me?
-Enough to be the next governor?
-Exactly.
You're fine, Yogi.
It's just a few scrapes and bruises.
I don't know, Mr. Ranger.
I'm pretty sure I heard my spine snap.
Well, you wouldn't be able to stand.
And you wouldn't be able to eat.
I'm okay!
Yogi, Boo Boo, I would like to introduce you to Rachel Johnson who's here to make a nature documentary.
[GROWLS]
What the heck was that?
I was saying hello.
I lived in a den with brown bears for six months.
Only bear I've ever lived with is Boo Boo.
And he only makes that sound after he's eaten baked beans.
Heh, heh.
I have problems with baked beans.
And for a little bear, he makes a lot of stink.
Okay, I have some fantastic river otters you can film instead.
-Could get a hat and tie on the slow one.
-No, you know, I really, really like these two.
-Would you guys mind if I shoot you?
YOGI:
Huh?
[RAPID FOOTSTEPS]
Yogi, I think she meant with a camera.
Yes.
Of course with a camera.
Heh-heh-heh.
I knew that.
But not just any camera.
This isn't gonna make me look fat, is it?
RACHEL:
No, you are gonna look great.
Okay, just a few more adjustments.
[WHISPERING] Please, excuse the pre-tied bow tie.
My mornings are often rushed.
It's fine, Boo Boo.
This is going to be a whole new perspective for a documentary.
The Boo Boo cam will capture the true wilderness in all its natural glory.
No other human in sight.
That sounds like my apartment.
Ha, ha.
Uh, you know, because I live alone.
Well, plenty of women have tried to change that.
It's just, I haven't found one that--
-Likes you?
-What?
No.
No, that--
Will return your calls?
Can you stop helping, please?
Sir, I can see you like this lady.
But your courting rituals need work.
What you need to do is follow her around for two days making snorting sounds.
Then fight any male that looks at her.
And then, of course, urinate on her to mark her as your territory.
Works every time.
I got it under control, Yogi.
-Boo Boo, you're rolling.
-Cool.
Yogi Bear, a brown bear commonly found in North America and Alaska.
Weighing up to 1800 pounds, brown bears are also the national animal of Finland.
I don't think you have to narrate.
But I liked where you were going with it, Boo Boo.
-I was hooked.
-Really?
Yes.
Now try to film from flattering angles, if you know what I mean.
Pic-a-nic baskets may be delicious on the lips, but they're a lifetime on the hips.
Oh, no.
Ranger Smith!
Ranger Smith.
The mayor's here.
What's he doing here?
Why didn't he give us more warning?
I have to secure the area.
All units, lock down the park.
Repeat, lock down the park.
Jones, you know I'm the only other ranger here, right?
Yeah.
-Ranger Smith, we need to talk.
-You could've just called.
BROWN:
Yeah, but I thought this would be more friendly.
I'm really working on my people skills.
Anyway, I am closing your park down.
-Okay.
-What?
Oh, yeah, this place just costs the city way too much money.
Jellystone hasn't made its operating budget in 10 years.
You know, it's hard to compete with all those amusement parks--
Oh, hey, you're not kidding.
Oh, have you guys been to Lincoln Log Land yet?
Oh, man, they have got a roller coaster there, it's made completely out of logs.
It's just like they rode in the pioneer days.
It's unbelievable.
Sir, Jellystone is special.
Okay?
It's turning 100 years old this very year.
Why, it's a landmark.
I would never let it be closed down.
Well, uh, you actually don't have a choice.
Have you read the city bylaws lately?
Chapter 6.
Section 73.
"Any municipal property that can't generate enough money to cover its operating budget can be rezoned for other uses."
And since Jellystone loses money every year, we're shutting it down.
Uh, sorry?
[BOTH CHUCKLE]
-I thought that went well.
CHIEF:
Yeah.
SMITH:
Just a second, Mr. Mayor.
Who says we can't cover our budget?
Park doesn't report earnings till next quarter.
Yeah, which is like one week away.
Come on, Smith.
You gotta be $20,000 in the hole.
We wish.
Yeah.
Try 30,562.
That's probably a couple hundred extra for the map stand.
I think it's confession time.
-I only pretended to fix it.
-Thanks, Jones.
Sounds like you're in pretty deep there, Smith.
Maybe we are.
But this is one of the Iast places families can go to be close to nature.
The world needs that.
Well, I'm not mayor of the world.
I'm mayor of this city.
And this city needs this park rezoned.
I'm sorry.
I feel awful about it.
Even though I look really good.
This is a new suit.
So, okay.
Maybe we don't have our operating budget today.
But you know what?
-A lot can happen in a week.
-All right.
Have it your way.
Take a week.
Hey, I'll even get you started.
What's the admission fee for one car again?
Four dollars.
Four dollars, huh?
Four whole dollars?
Well, that changes everything.
Oh, my goodness.
Well, I only need to come back in here like, uh, what, 10,000 more times?
[LAUGHING]
In a week!
Do I have time for that?
-Impossible.
-Oh, shoot.
[WEIRD AL YANKOVIC'S "LASAGNA" PLAYING ON STEREO]
You want-a some-a lasagna?
You hungry, buddy?
Of course!
I'm always hungry.
I was talking to my pet turtle.
Here you go.
That better not be my beef jerky.
[TURTLE CHEWING]
[BELCHES]
So, what's the big deal, Yogi?
This is the big deal, Boo Boo.
It's my masterpiece.
The Basket-Nabber 2000.
The most advanced pic-a-nic basket-stealing technology ever invented.
Wow.
Climb aboard.
This glider can steer dive, shoot rubber bands at pesky-type birds and even has an air bag.
Had an air bag.
Sorry, Yogi.
Not to worry.
We could cushion our landing with all the pic-a-nic baskets we swipe.
Now, how's that copilot seat feel?
A little wobbly, like it's not tied on very tight.
You won't feel that in the air.
Get ready to fly faster than the speed of sandwich, Boo Boo.
We're gonna break the pic-a-nic barrier.
SMITH:
Yogi!
-Uh-oh.
That's not his happy voice.
Don't move.
I'm switching the glider into stealth mode.
Stealth mode?
Wow.
How are you able to--?
Oh.
Ah, Mr. Ranger, sir.
Welcome.
Can I interest you in a sody pop?
-There you go.
-When did you steal our vending machine?
I, um-
- I'm repairing it, sir.
This machine gives its sodas away for free when a bear kicks it.
Look, a camper has reported some missing fishing poles so I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say it was you.
Fishing poles?
Sir, I'm a bear.
If I wanted to catch fish, I would just use my....
Your paws, Yogi.
Isn't that kind of unsanitary?
What's that?
-What's what?
-That thing.
-What thing?
-The thing under the blanket.
-Blanket?
-The object right behind you.
Oh.
Oh, that.
Heh.
A sculpture.
I'm sculpting now.
Mostly landscapes.
And where's Boo Boo?
-France.
-What?
-That's not close by, is it?
-No.
Then he's in the bathroom.
-Excuse me.
-Wait!
[STAMMERING]
Hey, this isn't the bathroom.
I'm telling you, Mr. Ranger, it's not for stealing pic-a-nic baskets.
It says "Basket-Nabber 2000" right here, Yogi.
I do regret calling it that now.
I know I'm always saying, "Stay away from the campers."
This is different.
Jellystone is in real trouble.
If I don't raise $30,000 in a week, this park's getting rezoned.
Rezoned?
What does that mean?
It means the park won't be a park anymore.
The city will use this land for something else.
So we have got to do everything we can to help save it.
Which means you have gotta stop stealing food so that campers will leave here happy.
But they do leave here happy.
Getting your food stolen by Yogi Bear is special.
People come here for that.
It's like catching a foul ball at a baseball game.
Nope.
It's like getting your food stolen at a baseball game.
Come on, Yogi.
Would it really be so hard to be a regular bear?
You know, to forage for food, to walk around on all fours to hibernate a little, or a lot.
If nature had meant for me to be a regular bear it wouldn't have given me such a good thought-cooker, sir.
I can't help it if my melon is full of smart juice.
Yogi, your melon is hurting this park.
There are repercussions to stealing people's picnic baskets.
Not in my experience, sir.
[MECHANISM TICKING]
[BELL RINGS]
[GRUNTS]
On the other hand--
[SCREAMS]
Ranger Smith, mind if I borrow the 'dilla?
It's an emergency.
Somebody parked without parking decals.
Jones, I would really prefer it if you focused on just maintaining the park instead.
Let me deal with the visitors until you've had more experience.
Sorry, sir.
Guess that's just the Eagle Scout in me, you know?
Always wanting to be in control, be a leader.
Live up to this fanny pack full of merit badges.
You know that fanny pack is for first aid supplies, right?
A merit badge in first aid is the only supply I need, sir.
Right, but it might not be the only supply a hurt person needs.
You seen Rachel?
Yeah, I saw her.
She was heading up to Lookout Mountain.
She can't be far.
I'll drive.
Let's roll.
Jones.
The sprawling beauty of Jellystone Park.
A timeless stretch of wilderness untouched by man.
Oh.
Ranger Smith.
Wow, heh.
What's with the fancy outfit?
Dress greens.
I always wear dress greens in the evening.
You know, in case there's, you know--
-I don't know how to talk to girls.
-Oh.
Why do you think I spend so much time with animals?
All you have to do is scratch their backside and you've got a friend for life.
Try that with people and all of a sudden you're the weird girl on the bus that nobody wants to sit next to.
Um, uh, listen.
I was wondering, you know, if you were--
I mean, it's getting late and we could, uh-- If you want.
I mean, it's not that-
- You don't-
- It's--
You know, it's not a worry.
Don't worry.
Did you just ask me to dinner?
Yes.
I did.
Heh.
-Good, you got that, huh?
-Yes.
I just thought, well, it's getting late.
I happen to know this great place.
-Very gourmet.
-Really?
Where?
So close you won't believe it.
Wow, how did you ever find this place?
This is a four-star porch.
And fresh from the hot plate, I give you...
-...rack of Spam.
-Oh.
Wow.
Maybe "gourmet" was a bit of a stretch.
No, it actually looks wonderful.
Great.
You know, this really is a peaceful place.
It's something, isn't it?
I pretty much grew up here.
My father was a ranger when I was a kid and he turned this park into the number one tourist destination in the state.
I mean, it was a park, you know?
Like families came by the hundreds swam in the streams, hiked on the trails.
It was really something.
This is really good.
Anyway, I don't know.
Maybe it's my fault.
I spent so many years learning everything I could about the park so I'd be a better ranger.
Maybe instead, I should have come up with a gimmick to get people to come here.
You know, change the name to Extreme Jellystone.
-I think that it's perfect just the way it is.
-You do?
You're right.
Absolutely.
There's no better place on earth.
YOGI:
Hey, Mr. Ranger.
-Except a place without him.
Evening, Mr. Ranger, sir.
Madame Moviemaker Lady.
And yes, I'm using the fancy tense to show you the utmost respect.
Hi.
Ha, ha.
What do you want, Yogi?
Well, I was thinking about the park's prickly predicament and I would like to do my part to help.
This is all the money I have saved.
Almost $100.
I was going to use it on myself, but I'd rather donate it to Jellystone.
Well, thank you, Yogi.
That's--
That is very sweet.
-Where does a bear get money from?
-That brown box by the parking lot.
The park donation box.
Yep.
But I want you to have it.
Consider it a gift to Jellystone.
That won't be hard.
Look, guys, I appreciate the effort.
But what this park needs is visitors and lots of them.
Well, I can help you there, sir.
Just make me a headliner.
I will rock this place.
-Kick it, Boo Boo.
-Kicking it.
[SIR MIX-A-LOT'S "BABY GOT BACK" PLAYING]
I like big butts and I cannot lie You other brothers can't deny
That when a girl walks in With a itty-bitty waist
And a round thing in your face You get sprung
[MUSIC STOPS]
That's not gonna work either, Yogi.
You're right.
We need something flashier than music.
Not a problem.
I've got this water-skllng routine that will change the face of entertainment.
Got a little of everything.
Music, stunts, magic.
-And I jump over Boo Boo at the end.
-No, you don't.
-I want to try it.
-I don't care.
I hate to interrupt, but you're not gonna water-ski or dance or do anything that might disturb the campers, okay?
If what you really want to do is help save this park you will lay low, stay away from people.
Think you can do that for me?
You have my word, Mr. Ranger.
I will be seen, but not heard.
Or seen.
Fine.
Huh?
You guys done with that Spam?
-Get out of here.
-Okay.
Sheesh!
Hey.
What's this?
Seasons pass applications.
Unfortunately, not a lot of takers on those.
Fifty bucks for an entire year?
Including camping fees?
That's a bargain.
If this were a place people wanted to visit throughout the year.
Maybe Yogi was on to something.
-You said the park was turning 100, right?
-Right.
Well, a big event could really pull people in.
Yeah, you're right.
We could have, like, a moss collection day or a big squirrel chase.
-Or....
-Fireworks.
Yes.
Exactly.
Why didn't I think of that?
We could host a big centennial festival.
People always show up for fireworks.
If even half of the people buy season passes the park makes enough money to stay open.
Right.
Let's get the word out.
I think I can help with that.
[PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY]
That is great.
How did we pay for it?
We didn't.
It was some fast-food restaurant but I rearranged the letters right before the plane took off.
[BOTH CHUCKLE]
You're very cool, Rachel Johnson.
You're pretty cool yourself.
I do have my own kind of natural swagger.
[SCREAMS]
Jellystone National Park, 100th year anniversary.
There'll be fireworks.
Just stay calm, Jones.
You should be patrolling in the Armadillo making park-impacting decisions, but--
-Hey, 100th year anniversary.
-Thanks.
But you're not there yet.
You still have to follow orders.
Even if those orders make you look like a giant Cheez-It.
Mr. Mayor!
Hi, Mr. Mayor.
Why is it only going halfway down again?
Doesn't make any-
- No!
Oh, okay.
Is it a double tap or do I have to press it--?
-Oh, dang it!
-I got it, sir.
Yeah.
That's exactly what I did.
Let me see one of those fliers.
"Come celebrate Jellystone's 100th anniversary with fireworks and fun."
"And receive $10 off a season pass"?
He's gonna try to make the budget selling season passes.
[BOTH GROAN]
Yeah, ugh.
It's not a very good idea, in my opinion.
But nobody consulted me, because my job is just to maintain the park which is basically poking trash with a stick.
Yeah.
Yeah, why is a guy with your talent doing this insulting grunt work?
You should be running a park.
Yeah, but Ranger Smith says I have to pay my dues.
-Excuse me?
-What?
-He has to pay his dues?
Ha.
-Ha, ha.
Nobody pays dues anymore.
You gotta be in charge now while you still know everything.
-That's what I've been saying.
-Yeah.
Buddy, if it was up to me, you would be the head ranger of Jellystone already.
-You'd put me in charge?
-In a second.
Yes.
You know, if this centennial festival didn't work out, I probably could relocate Smith.
You know, uh, maybe you could help me with that.
Make sure it doesn't succeed?
Wait, you mean, like, sabotage it?
No.
Oh, no, no, no.
No, I want you to be head ranger.
It just so happens that the only way to do that is to bring down this festival.
But spend the rest of your life as second-in-command if you like.
That's fine.
It's a perfectly valid life choice.
Well, you just think about it and give me a call, okay?
Here's my card.
So long.
Hey.
Now why is it doing that?
No.
Boy Scouts are loyal, thrifty, kind....
Hey, you're back.
Hey, thanks for getting those fliers out.
Let me tell you, this festival is gonna be huge.
Hey, Ranger Smith, how long do you think until I reach head ranger status?
Oh, no time at all.
I did it in 12 short years.
Ha, okay.
Are you serious?
Just be patient, Jones.
It'll be here before you know it.
This festival's gonna be great!
I can't wait 12 years.
[PEOPLE CHEERING AND LAUGHING]
Seasons pass order forms.
Seasons pass order forms.
Thank you.
Seasons pass order forms, $10 off today.
Ah, enjoy.
I can't take it, Boo Boo.
Two days without a tasty treat to eat?
And I have to sit up here while they're having a "happy birthday, Jellystone" party?
[SNIFFING]
And they have doughnuts.
Doughnuts!
BOO BOO [OVER RADIO]:
Yogi, what are you doing?
-Yogi!
-I'm going.
Hey.
Wait.
Don't do it, Yogi.
You promised Mr. Ranger.
You're right.
I'm losing control, Boo Boo.
I don't know who's steering the ship.
Here.
I want you to handcuff me to this tree and not unlock it no matter what I say.
Okay, Yogi.
-Okay, unlock me.
-Huh?
It was a bad idea.
Unlock me.
[GRUNTING]
Unlock me!
[GROWLING]
Okay.
Here you go.
JONES:
Folks, I hate to say this, but there are no spots left.
Forecast called for thunderstorms.
Severe lightning.
I fear for your young ones.
[CAR HORN HONKING]
We're out of fireworks, I'm afraid.
It's just sparklers left.
Oh, no.
You look nice.
Your napkin matches your tie.
I don't need you to kiss up to me.
Got this guy for that.
That's a good point, sir.
You were gonna handle this situation, yet there are quite a few people here.
Sir, I tried.
All last night I spent taking down fliers.
I blocked the entrance with a vehicle to back up traffic.
I hung up "rabid squirrel" signs everywhere.
Those were hand-drawn.
-Nothing is working.
-You need to think of something, don't you?
Or maybe you're just not head ranger material.
Mr. Mayor.
Mayor's yes man.
So glad you could join us.
I saved you a nice spot next to the porta-potties.
Oh, well, thank you.
Well, that's very thoughtful.
You know, I'm just so glad that these festivities are going so well, Smith.
I just hope nothing goes wrong.
[HORN HONKING]
We are gonna pull this off, Jonesy.
I've seen hundreds of people filling out seasons pass order forms.
The weather's great.
The fireworks, ready to go.
Even Yogi's staying out of the way.
Yogi.
[GROANING]
Hey, guys.
Sorry, just wandering around, bored out of my mind.
Bored?
But the 100th anniversary extravaganza's going on.
Yeah, more like 100th anniversary lame-aganza.
You know, because it's so lame.
People see fireworks every day in the city.
They thought they'd see something different here.
I knew it.
I should be out there doing my water-ski routine.
I'm a shining star and Ranger Smith is holding me back.
I don't know, Yogi.
Mr. Ranger is usually right about these things.
No, Boo Boo, Ranger Smith is in denial.
I mean, he's lost it, you know?
I saw him a couple days ago.
He was filling his pockets with dirt.
He said he's gonna start moving the park to his apartment piece by piece.
-How big is his apartment?
-There's still time.
I won't be able to do the half-hour artistic program but that was more for me anyway.
These people need the razzle-dazzle.
I don't think we've practiced the razzle-dazzle.
You're not supposed to, Boo Boo.
That's where it gets the razzle.
Yogi, I really don't think we should--
Boo Boo, you've tried to stop my brilliant ideas with common sense a thousand times.
Has it ever worked?
No.
Then let's go, go, go.
What does that taste like?
Unemployment?
-I'm sorry.
-Yeah.
Thanks again for helping with the fireworks.
I don't know where Jones disappeared to.
My pleasure.
You know, um, Rachel, I've been wanting to tell you...
-...well, how much I--
-Ranger--
No, please, let me get through this.
I'm not very good with words.
But I have never felt so gushy.
Ha-ha-ha.
-You know?
-Ranger--
You know what I did?
I went and I wrote a song about you.
It's like this:
[HUMMING]
Oh, no.
[SINGING] I saw you at the station
Had a heart palpitation
My sickness was love And you're the medication
Rachel
-Rachel
-The microphone is on.
SMITH:
And it comes around again
Rachel, Rachel, Rachel
The microphone is on.
Yes, the mic--
[CLEARS THROAT THEN LAUGHS]
Hi.
Hello and welcome to the 100th anniversary of Jellystone!
[CHEERING]
Thank you.
It is so wonderful to see so many people here today.
I've noticed many of you filling out your seasons pass order forms.
We're more than happy to collect those after the fireworks.
But first, please, sit back, get comfortable and enjoy the show!
-Terrific.
-Mr.
Mayor?
[POISON'S "NOTHIN' BUT A GOOD TIME" PLAYING ON STEREO]
That's not the right music.
I'll take it from here, Mr. Ranger!
Oh, no.
Full speed ahead, Boo Boo.
Okay.
Not bad, eh, Boo Boo?
Looking good, Yogi.
-This cannot be happening.
-Oh, it's happening.
[YOGI STAMMERING]
Hello, Jellystone!
[CROWD CHEERING]
No, don't encourage him!
They love me.
I can do no wrong.
Watch this.
All right, Boo Boo!
Turn up the heat!
Phase two, go.
I'm an unstoppable water-skllng machine.
[LAUGHING]
Ta-da!
Oh, wait.
There's more.
How about if I heat things up?
[SMITH WHIMPERS]
[GROANING]
Don't need nothin' but a good time
And it don't get better than this
Yogi!
Yogi, your cape.
I know.
It is magnificent.
And on fire.
Huh?
Fire!
[GROANING]
-Turn the boat!
-Huh?
-Turn, Boo Boo!
-Hang on, Yogi!
Too much razzle!
[CROWD SCREAMING]
[GASPS]
-Nice one.
-Thanks.
[RACHEL GASPS]
Jump!
[CHUCKLING]
[CHEERING]
[ALL GASP]
[MURMURING]
Let's go.
[SCREAMING AND SHOUTING]
MAN:
Out of my way!
[CHUCKLING]
This could not have gone more perfectly.
Hey, you got a little, uh....
Never mind.
Let's go.
[SIGHS]
[WOOD SNAPPING AND CREAKING]
Mr. Ranger, I thought--
Yogi, that's the problem.
All the thinking.
Hey, you know what would be great?
If you didn't think.
If you could just be a regular bear.
You know, sitting in the woods, minding his own business.
But no, you're different.
You're smart.
And you'd rather spend your days being selfish and destructive while everyone else pays the price.
But I guess it wasn't enough, screwing up my life.
No, this time you had to go and bring down this entire park.
So tell me, Yogi how smart are you now?
Hey, there!
That was quite a show you put on yesterday.
Ha-ha-ha.
I can't wait to see what you do with this.
That's your new assignment.
Evergreen Park.
Oh, I think you're just going to find it delightful.
Oh, and, uh, Ranger Jones is gonna be taking over here.
Ranger Jones?
Well, I have got a press conference to plan.
You see, it turns out I've saved the city.
Don't forget to vote, my friend.
Brown for governor!
Ha-ha-ha.
He's not gonna vote for me, is he?
Uh, no.
You did everything you could.
Doesn't matter.
This park needed a ranger who could make it popular again.
I'm just some guy who knows how old every tree is.
Fat lot of good that did Jellystone.
Face it.
You and I are just two people who care about things that nobody else does and that's why we're alone.
Or maybe that's why we found each other.
Did you ever think of that?
Rachel, you and this park have one thing in common.
You both deserve a better man than me.
I can't believe he's really gone.
Yogi, are you okay?
I'm done being special, Boo Boo.
Ranger Smith was right.
My whole life, I've been different.
But it's done nothing but hurt people.
The world would be better off if I was only as smart as the average bear.
Yogi, what are you doing?
I'm leaving, Boo Boo.
-I am going to forage for food in the wild.
-Huh?
Might even catch some fish.
With my paws.
[SIGHS]
I'm just gonna grab a little something for the road.
Some chips and soda.
And this.
Peach pie.
Any more of that casserole?
Top shelf.
I'll be out there.
Fending for myself.
Foraging for food in the wild.
[METAL CLANKING]
Goodbye, horsepower limiter.
There's a new head ranger in town.
Let's see what you got.
[GRUNTING]
Perfect.
[SOBBING]
I'm sorry, Ranger Smith.
No more food.
No more pic-a-nickers.
How could this get any worse?
[THUNDER BOOMING]
Oh.
Ah, Evergreen Park.
Yes, it is simply delightful.
[GIGGLING]
-Come on.
-I've got it, sir.
This is unbelievable.
Ah, Evergreen Park.
Lovely, isn't it?
This isn't a park.
I can barely breathe in here.
Look at these trees.
They're all plastic.
Oh, no, they're real.
It's just years of smog and pollution have left a plastic-like coating on them.
Think people will be happy you're closing the most beautiful park in the state?
Well, they will be when they find out it's making the city rich and giving each citizen a check for $1000.
How is that even possible?
Oh, well, it turns out that there has been some agricultural interest in the park.
And it's a lot more profitable than people in station wagons making s'mores.
[LAUGHING]
Have a good day, Ranger Smith.
I hate this car.
I hate it.
[GRUNTS]
[CHAINSAWS BUZZING]
Yeah!
Oh, hey, there he is.
Ha-ha-ha.
Whoa, hey, Mr. Mayor!
I, uh....
Just finishing some stamping.
You are doing great, Jones.
I knew you were the guy for this job.
Quick thing.
You'll probably notice some giant trucks rumbling by.
We're just clearing a little patch of trees for my press conference.
No big deal.
Um, wait, you're cutting down trees?
Oh, yeah.
Well, just a few.
It's nothing to worry about.
Actually gonna improve the park quite a bit.
I'll bet one of the first things you noticed as head ranger is that you need more clear spaces here, and you are absolutely right.
Now you can host concerts and Boy Scout jamborees.
That's a pretty smart move there, Head Ranger Jones.
I have some other park improvements I want to run by you.
Oh, splendid, yes.
I think I have a few moments to hear those.
Look into the security arrangements for tomorrow.
I don't want any surprises.
I'll hear what Ding-Dong has to say.
What do you got?
I'm hungrier than the average bear.
I wish I could find a bush that tasted like birthday cake.
Gotcha.
[GROANS]
Pretend it's a gummy worm.
Pretend it's a gummy worm.
[GASPS]
Yogi, I've been looking everywhere for you.
Not now, Boo Boo.
I'm busy foraging.
[GROANS]
[SHOUTS]
Come on, Yogi.
Jellystone is in trouble.
We need your help.
Nothing I can do, Boo Boo.
I'm average now.
My brain is out of business.
I wouldn't even be standing if my paws didn't hurt.
Quit feeling sorry for yourself.
You know you're not an average bear.
Hey, hey, Boo Boo.
You're right, I'm not.
I failed at that too.
Hey, come back here.
You've gotta save Jellystone.
YOGI:
What are you doing?
I'm not--
Yogi, you have to use your smarts for good.
And if you can't see that, maybe you are just an average bear.
Come on.
[GRUNTING]
Now do you understand?
What's going on, Boo Boo?
I don't know.
But whatever it is I think they're just getting started.
Boo Boo get my collar.
Nobody is gonna hurt Jellystone.
Where are we going, Yogi?
We can't get Jellystone back alone, Boo Boo.
My thinker is good, but Ranger Smith's is better.
He was going to a place called Evergreen Park.
That's right.
In the city.
The city?
That's a long walk.
Don't be silly, Boo Boo.
I've already got a smarty-smart cheat to keep our feet off the street.
Get ready for it.
Here it comes.
Run, Boo Boo, run!
Hurry, Boo Boo.
I think we gotta jump for it.
Ready?
All aboard.
Good.
Yogi, grab my paw.
[GROANING]
[GRUNTING]
Sorry.
[YOGI SHOUTING]
Boo Boo, Boo Boo, Boo Boo!
I gotta get--!
I guess it makes a stop here.
Yup.
Looks like Evergreen Park is about two miles away from here.
Two miles?
I'll have to tap into my emergency rations.
Snack break.
Come on, Yogi.
We need to keep moving.
It's not that far and it's all downhill.
Downhill?
Excuse me, Mr. Dirty Shopper.
Any chance my friend and I might borrow your wheely-basket?
Is that chocolate?
[YOGI AND BOO BOO LAUGHING]
Okay, Boo Boo, keep it steady.
I'm okay, Ma.
Just--
Yeah, no, it's not Jellystone, but at least there's nothing here to drive me crazy.
-Hey, Mr. Ranger.
-Hey, Yogi.
[CART CRASHES]
All right, Ma, I gotta call you back.
What are you guys doing here?
We need your help, Mr. Ranger, sir.
But don't worry, my days of goofing things up for you are over.
MAN:
Hey, move that shopping cart!
[SHOUTING]
I'm okay!
I'm just gonna put this over here.
What do you want?
I don't have a life left for you to ruin anymore.
Sir, I know I messed things up and I'm sorry.
I never meant to.
You and Boo Boo are the best friends I ever had.
And I've never done anything but think of myself.
And now Jellystone is just gonna be a big field of stumps.
What?
They've started cutting down the trees.
"Agricultural interest" is logging.
Oh, no, not our Jellystone.
We have to save it, sir.
I don't think we can save it, Yogi.
I'm no smarter than you.
I lost Jellystone.
I lost Rachel.
It's over.
Mr. Ranger, I've learned two things from stealing pic-a-nic baskets.
One:
light mayonnaise is not nearly as good as regular mayonnaise.
And two: you can't fail if you never stop trying.
You have to fight for the things you love whether it's a park, a girl or a roast beef sandwich.
Don't give up now.
We're all Jellystone's got.
You're right, Yogi.
Jellystone's too important to give up on.
We gotta try.
Come on.
-Shotgun.
-Aw.
I never thought I'd see this.
Happy 100th anniversary, Jellystone.
Isn't that Miss Movie Lady?
RACHEL:
I gotta get in there.
You don't understand.
Let me in, please.
No can do.
Park is closed to the public until the press conference.
Mayor's orders.
Then go talk to him.
Tell him what I told you.
I'm sorry.
I don't really take orders from a--
I lived with gorillas, pal.
I know rage.
You do not want me to go gorilla on you.
[SCREAMS]
Uh, I'll speak to the mayor.
-Thank you.
-Okay.
Rachel.
Ranger Smith.
I didn't think I'd ever see you again.
I know.
I don't know what I was thinking.
I think you're perfect.
I think any guy in the world would be lucky just to stand next to you.
You really mean that?
Of course I do.
It's just, when I lost Jellystone, I felt like such a failure.
But losing you has felt much, much worse.
I'm like....
I'm like a genus without a phylum.
That's the sweetest thing anyone's ever said to me.
-So, um, we're still here.
YOGI:
Mm-hm.
Oh, right.
Ahem.
So, what are you doing here?
-Come on, I'll show you.
-Okay.
I was reviewing the documentary footage from Boo Boo's camera and I saw this.
Oh, my.
I see it.
I have a bald spot back there!
I'm not talking about you, Yogi.
I'm talking about this.
Yeah, it's my pet turtle.
He hangs out at the cave all the time.
True.
You know they don't come out of that shell?
I tried one time to see what one would look like without it.
But, nope, they're sewn in.
This is no regular turtle.
See the bulging frog-like eyes and the really wide mouth?
A frog-mouthed turtle?
Yup, Rafetus swinhoei.
SMITH:
But those are extinct.
For a hundred years, but apparently one still exists.
And he lives in there.
But they won't let me through the gates to go find him.
But if Jellystone has an endangered species living in it, then--
It has to be protected as a park.
That's the law.
That turtle can save this park.
Now I feel kinda bad about using him as a foot stool.
CHIEF:
You've seen the filmmaker?
Well, we spoke.
About extinct turtles.
You're telling me there is an extinct turtle living here in the park?
According to Miss Johnson's film, there is.
An extinct turtle?
That's great.
Visitors will come from miles around to see an endangered species.
Yes, they will, and that is great.
We need to find this turtle.
Just to keep it safe.
Have a vet check it out.
The whole deal.
The sooner we get to him the better.
Oh, we need a head ranger who's good enough to find it.
Someone who thinks like a turtle.
I am that head ranger.
Well, then why are you still here?
He's back.
Come on.
You need to let us in this park.
That turtle needs protection.
Don't worry about the turtle.
We're handling it.
We'll make sure he's put in a nice zoo.
No.
A turtle that's endangered can't be removed from its natural habitat.
It's against federal law.
It is?
Wow, I've never heard of that law in chapter 4, subsection 6 of the Wildlife Protection Mandate.
Don't worry, Mr. Ranger, sir.
That turtle is safe.
These people have no idea where my cave is.
The turtle's in the talking bear's cave.
JONES [OVER RADIO]:
Copy.
Wow, that backfired.
Okay.
You know what?
Fine,
You win.
What are you doing?
I have a plan.
One of the advantages of having lived here since I was a kid is I know this park like the back of my hand.
Let's go!
Hold on, boys.
All right.
Hey, there, little buddy.
Hello, there.
Uh-oh.
Sorry about that.
-Mayor Brown.
-This had better be good, Jones.
JONES:
I found the turtle.
He was in Boo Boo's sleeping bag.
But now I have him secure at the picnic area.
Jones, you're a hero.
Sit tight.
My chief of staff is on his way to get him.
Copy that.
Head Ranger Jones over and out.
SMITH:
He found the turtle.
Dang it.
Can't cross those rapids.
There's no way to get to him from here.
Well, there is one way.
There it is.
My masterpiece.
-You really think you can pull this off?
-I know I can, sir.
I'm gonna snatch that basket-type turtle box and fly away like a fuzzy bird.
And I've got the best copilot a basket-snatching machine could have.
-I don't know how to fly this thing.
-Well, you'll pick it up as we go.
SMITH:
Okay.
Look, just be careful, okay, Yogi?
Copy that, ground control.
Basket-Nabber 2000 ready for takeoff.
-Flight systems check.
Boo Boo?
-What?
-Can you reach the pedals?
-If I point my toes.
Flight systems are go.
Remember what I told you about flying gliders, Yogi.
Don't fight the wind.
As long as the wind wants me to snatch up that turtle, we'll get along just fine.
-All right.
YOGI:
Start pedaling, Boo Boo.
All right.
Here goes.
YOGI:
Hold on, Boo Boo.
Fasten your seat belt.
But there isn't one.
YOGI:
Here we go!
BOO BOO:
Oh, Yogi!
The wind should carry you south!
We'll meet you there!
Take your time, Mr. Ranger.
This machine is equipped with landing gear.
We'll touch down as soft as a feather.
Whoops.
This is your captain speaking.
We'll reach our turtle target in about two minutes.
So let's go ahead and start the beverage service.
-Yogi, look out.
-Aah!
-Trees!
-Yes, trees!
[BOTH SCREAMING]
I got it.
I got it.
I got it.
I don't got it!
BOO BOO:
Pull up.
-Hey!
-Pull up!
You did it, Yogi.
Oh.
Yeah.
Ha-ha-ha.
Great job, Jones.
I'll get this guy to the city zoo.
-The city zoo?
-Yep.
They got a nice spot ready in the reptile house.
The city zoo doesn't have a reptile house.
They're building one.
-Who is?
-Builders.
Sure you're trying to protect the turtle?
Yeah, we love turtles.
Then you won't mind if I hold onto him until I notify the Wildlife Federation, right?
All right.
You're gonna find this out in a few hours anyway, so I might as well tell you.
We gotta lose this turtle to sell logging rights to the park.
Logging?
The whole park?
Yeah, but who cares?
It's still a park, just without trees.
And they'll grow back.
Yeah, in like 200 years.
It doesn't matter.
Your career is what matters.
Ha-ha-ha.
Turtle target acquired.
I need 20 more feet of altitude.
Engage the hand pedals.
You couldn't put the hand pedals by you?
There's a suggestion box behind the seat, Boo Boo.
[GROANS]
Wait, you don't want to approach him like that.
He's poisonous.
He's in a basket.
But he can spit.
Poison.
He'll aim at your eyes.
Melt them out of your head.
-I'm telling you, that turtle is deadly.
-What are you looking at?
-Hook me in, Boo Boo.
-Okay.
And fire!
Here you go.
Huh?
Yogi, wait!
Here I come!
He's going for the turtle.
-Mind if I borrow this?
-Hey!
[YOGI LAUGHS]
Look, Boo Boo!
We got the turtle!
Hey, why aren't you in your seat?
That bear knows how to steal a basket.
Everybody after that glider now!
I'm not gonna let a bear make me look bad.
Been there, buddy.
We're drifting too far right.
I wanna get us outside the park.
Don't fight the wind, Yogi.
Remember what Miss Movie Lady said about--
Never mind.
YOGI:
Hang on, Boo Boo.
-What do we do now?
Did you check the safety manual?
It's just a picture of us screaming.
[BOTH SCREAMING]
We've got to deject, Boo.
Don't you mean eject?
Eject is up.
Deject is down.
In case of emergency your seat can also be used as a flotation device!
[YOGI LAUGHING]
[GRUNTING]
Hey, told you.
Nothing to worry about.
I actually think I wasn't worried enough.
Let me see how our little passenger is doing.
Wonder why they call him a frog-mouthed turtle anyway?
Hey!
SMITH:
Hey, guys, over here!
Yogi, grab the branch.
Got you, Mr. Ranger, sir.
[SMITH AND RACHEL GRUNT]
-Welcome aboard.
SMITH:
Yogi.
We were trying to get you off the raft.
Yeah, that makes more sense.
You guys did it.
You saved him.
[CAR HORN HONKS]
Oh, no.
They're gonna catch us downstream.
I'm on it.
No, Yogi, don't.
Problem solved.
They can't catch us now.
Yeah, because now we are headed straight for the Jellyjarring Rapids.
[GRUNTS]
-Grab a paddle.
-Tuck your head in, little buddy.
Brace yourselves.
Oh, come on, turtle.
Don't worry, I put safety belts in this raft for just such an occasion.
You better hang on.
Mr. Ranger said--
YOGI:
We're gonna be fine, Boo Boo.
Just sit back and let Mother Nature carry us to--
[ALL SCREAMING]
I think Mother Nature's kind of cranky today.
You okay, Yogi?
Fine!
Turtle!
YOGI:
Who's that?
I can't see.
Come here, turtle.
-Got him.
SMITH:
Good work, Boo Boo.
We made it through the rapids.
Yeah, but that means the falls are just up ahead.
Hold on!
[SCREAMING]
Yogi.
Yogi.
Now who says there are no rides at Jellystone?
Yeah, you've definitely got the thrill part down.
ANNOUNCER:
Please, take your seats.
The press conference is about to begin.
That's over a mile away.
We're never gonna make that in time.
[ALL GASP]
-Ranger Jones?
-I messed up pretty bad, sir.
-I know.
It's okay.
-I wanted to be head ranger.
Because you're a good head ranger and I value leadership.
I have a merit badge--
Can we talk later?
We're pressed for time.
Yes.
Get in.
[SIREN WAILING]
YOGI:
Boo Boo!
Boo Boo!
Wait up!
SMITH:
Well, well.
Guess who we found.
Starts with T and ends with a-- "Urtle"?
It's over.
Call off the logging.
The law says this park is now a protected nature preserve.
You think I care about what the law says?
Or about some endangered "frog-mouthed turtle"?
Or some stupid park for families to have a picnic in?
I care about power, you pinheads!
And I'm gonna get it.
Nobody knows this turtle exists.
And nobody ever will.
You found the turtle.
Get this thing out of here before anybody else sees it.
-Rachel!
-Oh!
Yogi!
BOO BOO:
Yogi, here!
Thank you.
-Yogi.
-I'm sorry.
He was open.
Ha, ha.
Now if you'll excuse me, I have a press conference.
I can still tell them what you did.
Oh, yeah?
Without that turtle or a scrap of evidence, go right ahead.
Well, you might as well tell them Bigfoot is here.
Ha-ha-ha.
And do yourself a favor, there, ranger.
Try to keep your dignity.
It's all you have left.
You know what?
I'm taking care of this thing myself this time.
That's the only way to make sure the job is done right.
But that's why I'm the mayor's right-hand man, right?
Because I don't make mistakes.
Hey, you know, people are wondering:
"Why should I vote for Mayor Brown to be governor?"
Well, how about this:
Mayor Brown just turned the city's budget from a deficit into a surplus!
And put $1000 into the pocket of every citizen of this city!
Now before I sign the paperwork that will save the city why don't you all take a look at my first campaign ad for governor?
ANNOUNCER:
Mayor Brown, the right choice for governor.
We're out of time.
Must be something we can do.
Anybody have any ideas?
Well, I guess this is going to be a pretty sad documentary, huh?
Are you--?
Is he still filming?
I needed more footage, so I told him to keep it rolling.
I can plug that into the video feed right up there.
I just need a way to distract the guards.
I think we can take care of that.
ANNOUNCER:
He supports public safety.
[JOURNEY'S "DON'T STOP BELIEVING" PLAYING ON TV]
All right, hurry up, people.
Focus.
Let's go save those orphans.
YOGI:
Hey, hey, hey, check this out!
-Kick it, Boo Boo.
-Kicking it.
Don't stop believing
[LAUGHING]
Hold on to that feeling
ANNOUNCER:
He's tough on crime.
[SHOUTS]
Hey, hey, hey, look at this.
Keep your eye on the little bear.
Look at the skills.
Amazing!
[GRUNTING]
ANNOUNCER:
And here's what Mayor Brown proudly has to say about protecting our natural resources.
[MUSIC STOPS]
You think I care about what the law says?
Or about some endangered "frog-mouthed turtle"?
-Some stupid park for families to picnic in?
-No.
No.
No.
I care about power, you pinheads!
Oh, boy.
Nobody knows this turtle exists.
And nobody ever will.
[BOOING AND JEERING]
[LAUGHING]
There's about to be a riot out there.
I need you out front.
[GRUNTS]
Okay.
No.
Hey, wait.
Wait, wait, wait.
Please, please, please.
That was not real.
Trust me, there is no such thing as a frog-mouthed turtle.
He's right next to me, isn't he?
Okay.
-We did it, Yogi!
-Up high, Boo Boo!
-All right!
JONES:
We got it!
Yogi!
All right, and now....
Miss Moviemaker Lady.
SMITH:
Hey, we did it.
[LAUGHING]
Hey, Mr. Ranger!
RACHEL:
Come on, Boo Boo.
-Okay.
I was wrong, Yogi.
I say from here on, we just be proud of who we are and fight for the things we're passionate about, like this park.
And Rachel.
And pic-a-nic baskets?
And pic-a-nic baskets.
-Aw, come here!
-No, you don't have to--
Okay.
All right, that's--
I'm good.
[CROWD CHATTERING]
RACHEL:
Here you go, Boo Boo.
Take good care of him.
Hey, there, buddy.
No, no, no, I never took a kickback on anything in my entire career.
No one loves turtles more than I do.
And nature in general.
I love trees.
Oh, no, you don't!
[GROWLS]
Gorilla?
Himalayan snow leopard.
Huh.
Welcome to Jellystone, home of the frog-mouthed turtle.
And brochures.
I'm Ranger Jones.
NARRATOR:
Ah, yes, Jellystone Park.
A wonderful little piece of paradise.
Where families come and soak up the tranquility of nature.
It's a place that--
[MACHINE WHIRRING]
Huh?
Never mind.
MAN:
Hey, hey, hey!
[CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY]
Hi.
Welcome.
Well, I am certainly glad that you are gonna be staying in Jellystone for a while.
And what animal will you be observing?
Well, I thought I would observe the courting rituals of the American ranger.
I happen to hear the American ranger is a very charming intelligent, attractive species.
One that always keeps his cool.
Even when basket-stealing bears push his buttons?
Listen, Yogi will be Yogi.
And I'm just not gonna let it bother me anymore.
Besides I have more important things to focus on.
Oh....
[LAUGHING]
I....
Let's-
- Let's try that again.
[HORN HONKING]
[GASPING]
Afternoon, Mr. Ranger, sir!
Hi, Miss Movie Lady!
[BARKING]
Yogi!
I love this place.
SMITH:
Yogi!
Hey!
srt English Subtitles Dan4Jem, ADMMXI
NARRATOR:
Jellystone Park.
One of the nation's oldest and most beautiful stretches of wilderness.
For years, families have headed out from the busy city eager to enjoy a little camping, fishing and, of course, observing the park's natural wildlife.
Boo Boo, I think it's time I introduced myself to that pic-a-nic basket.
You know, Yogi, we could just hunt for food.
AII the other animals do.
Boo Boo, a pic-a-nic basket has everything a bear needs.
And I'm not just talking about the treats and snack-type goodies.
No.
A pic-a-nic basket holds a Iot more than that.
It holds dreams.
[WHISPERING] What are we looking at?
I don't know.
Hook me in.
[IN NORMAL VOICE] You sure it'II work, Yogi?
well, you know, Boo Boo, I'm smarter than the average bear!
[SHOUTING]
[CHUCKLING]
AII right!
[GASPS]
[SHOUTING]
[GRUNTS]
[CHUCKLING]
[GROANS]
MAN:
Ranger Smith!
Sorry about that.
We got a 4-23 in Redwood valley, sir.
-A what?
-A bear disturbance.
-I think it's probabIy--
-I know who it is.
Why didn't you just say "bear disturbance"?
well, I....
Uh, well, it sounds cooler.
I mean, we're park rangers, sir.
You know:
"To protect and preserve."
Did you just make that motto up?
Yeah, I did.
Do you Iike it?
Ranger Jones, you know that, well, being a park ranger, it's not about mottos.
It's about keeping the park safe.
That's where the glory is.
Protecting all of this.
Yeah, I know.
Besides, that motto was still in the testing phase.
It's not Iike I made T-shirts or anything.
Heh, no, of course not.
Okay, I'm gonna deal with that 4-23.
Okay, copy that, sir.
Um, I'm actually gonna hop in the armadillo, make some rounds.
Jones, you know that the armadillo is for head ranger use only.
I might need it at any moment to deal with a park emergency.
Why don't you finish stacking those trail maps?
Yeah, sure.
Okay.
Yeah, because that's what future head rangers do, they stack maps.
Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy!
Our days of getting banged up to grab a meal are over, Boo Boo.
From now on, the pic-a-nic baskets are going to fall into our arms.
soldering iron.
BOO BOO:
Here you go.
-Thank you.
Okay.
That should do it.
Test rock.
Okay, Yogi.
YOGI:
Weight sensor triggered.
Basket in position.
Launch spring starts coiIing.
Firing pin drops.
And....
[BELL RINGS]
bull's-eye!
I'm so smart it hurts!
You're standing on the soldering iron.
Or it's that.
[SHOUTING]
Hot, hot, hot!
There's the test rock.
Now we just wait here for a pic-a-nic basket to fall into our arms.
Are you sure about this, Yogi?
people seem to get pretty mad when you--
A genius never questions his instincts, Boo Boo.
When you have a mind like mine you can't blink or you'II put a kink in your think.
Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.
We've got our first customers.
And they have pie!
I wonder what kind it is.
SMITH:
Yogi, are you out here?
-It's Mr. Ranger.
-Aah!
Get rid of the test rock.
Destroy the evidence.
I was never here.
SMITH:
Look-
- Ow!
hello, Mr. Ranger, sir.
Did you just--?
Did you guys--?
Did you--?
Oh, never mind.
Look, there was a complaint about a bear interfering with a family picnic.
I see.
And you'd Iike us to mount some sort of investigation?
No, I think it was you.
What?
!
How can you even think that?
Are you feverish?
Let me press my lips against your forehead.
Wait!
You're not pressing your lips against my forehead.
Hey, it's a Iot better than the way they take my temperature.
[CHUCKLES]
No, look, Yogi, we've been over this many times.
Bears are supposed to avoid people, not run around stealing their food.
I agree, sir.
That's why my friend Boo Boo and I would never think of disturbing a family's pic-a-nic.
[BELL RINGS AND WOOD CLUNKS]
[WOMAN SCREAMS]
Huh.
It missed.
[GROANS]
Good day, Mr. Ranger, sir.
We'II keep our eyes peeled.
I wonder if he noticed the pie.
JONES [CHOPPY OVER RADIO]:
Ra-
- Smith.
You have a vis-
- Over.
Didn't understand a word of that, Jones.
-Sorry.
Some lady's here to see you.
-Send her in.
-Okay.
I'II be in the armadillo.
-Or you could be....
-Map stacking?
-Map stacking.
-Ranger Smith?
-Yes.
-hello.
I'm rachel Johnson.
-Hi.
I was hoping to talk to you about filming a documentary here.
Sure.
I can handle you for that.
handle that for you.
Sorry.
My work isn't-- My brain isn't working right.
-I must have inhaled some jimsonweed.
-Oh.
Datura stramonium.
It's known to cause delirium...
-...cramping and nausea.
Heh.
-Cramping and nausea.
You've read The North American Wilderness Guide.
Yeah, I Iike to highlight all the plants and animals I see.
-I Iike to-
- Me too.
-Ha, ha!
Yeah.
[SMITH STAMMERING]
Ranger Smith.
At your service.
You want to film a documentary in JeIIystone?
Yes.
I sent you a letter about a month ago.
-Written on a piece of bark.
-That was you!
Yes.
I'm sorry about that.
I was in Sumatra, living among the orangutans at the time and they get very nervous if they spot anything from the modern world.
really?
Wow, that's amazing.
Then what did you use for ink?
Bird poop and spit.
Impressive.
So, what are you here to film?
well, I was hoping to shoot a local species.
Something to really capture the beauty of a national park.
Terrific.
What animal were you thinking?
I heard you had an unusual brown bear.
-Brown bear?
-Yes.
One that talks?
Those are so rare.
-None that I can think of.
-Named Yogi?
Wears a hat and a tie?
No, that doesn't ring a bell.
I think he's standing on the roof, trying to steal your lunchbox.
YOGI:
I smell PB and J.
[YOGI SHOUTING]
I'm all done.
Oh, right.
That Yogi.
Bankrupt?
No, no, no.
We're a city.
Cities don't go bankrupt.
They do when they're broke, sir.
We just have to find some money somewhere.
I'm about to run for governor.
How am I gonna do that when my own city is bankrupt?
Okay, yes.
Thank you.
-Here's the invoice, Mr. Mayor.
-Yikes!
Wow.
Ha.
I'm gonna pretend I didn't see that.
Just bill it to the city, okay?
Thank you.
Ugh.
How did we ever go so broke?
-I think we just spent too much.
-Hmm.
Is there anything we can sell?
You already sold the public golf course to condo developers two of the three fire stations to that frozen yogurt company.
You were selling the library, but it burned down.
Oh, yeah.
That was gonna be one of those make-your-own-doughnut places.
-No.
-Yeah.
-If you could dream it up, you could make it.
-Ah.
Love those.
We gotta think of something here.
well, if we don't have anything to sell, maybe we can profit off what we can't sell.
I don't understand those words.
Like when we sold the bottling rights to the water in Lake BeucIair.
-We made a fortune.
-Yeah.
SinkhoIe BeucIair is a great place to throw old mattresses.
-Oh, yeah.
-Hmm.
We just don't have any more resources to exploit.
Or do we?
JeIIystone.
If we rezone JeIIystone Park as agricultural land, we can sell the logging rights.
Here.
This company says they'II give us thousands of dollars an acre just to cut down the trees or something.
That'II be enough to balance the budget and give each citizen a big fat check.
[LAUGHING]
You have any idea how many votes that'II buy me?
-Enough to be the next governor?
-exactly.
You're fine, Yogi.
It's just a few scrapes and bruises.
I don't know, Mr. Ranger.
I'm pretty sure I heard my spine snap.
well, you wouldn't be able to stand.
And you wouldn't be able to eat.
I'm okay!
Yogi, Boo Boo, I would Iike to introduce you to rachel Johnson who's here to make a nature documentary.
[GROWLS]
What the heck was that?
I was saying hello.
I lived in a den with brown bears for six months.
only bear I've ever lived with is Boo Boo.
And he only makes that sound after he's eaten baked beans.
Heh, heh.
I have problems with baked beans.
And for a little bear, he makes a Iot of stink.
Okay, I have some fantastic river otters you can film instead.
-could get a hat and tie on the slow one.
-No, you know, I really, really like these two.
-would you guys mind if I shoot you?
YOGI:
Huh?
[RAPID FOOTSTEPS]
Yogi, I think she meant with a camera.
Yes.
Of course with a camera.
Heh-heh-heh.
I knew that.
But not just any camera.
This isn't gonna make me look fat, is it?
RACHEL:
No, you are gonna look great.
Okay, just a few more adjustments.
[WHISPERING] please, excuse the pre-tied bow tie.
My mornings are often rushed.
It's fine, Boo Boo.
This is going to be a whole new perspective for a documentary.
The Boo Boo cam will capture the true wilderness in all its natural glory.
No other human in sight.
That sounds like my apartment.
Ha, ha.
Uh, you know, because I Iive alone.
well, plenty of women have tried to change that.
It's just, I haven't found one that--
-Likes you?
-What?
No.
No, that--
will return your calls?
Can you stop helping, please?
Sir, I can see you Iike this lady.
But your courting rituals need work.
What you need to do is follow her around for two days making snorting sounds.
Then fight any male that looks at her.
And then, of course, urinate on her to mark her as your territory.
Works every time.
I got it under control, Yogi.
-Boo Boo, you're rolling.
-cool.
Yogi Bear, a brown bear commonly found in North America and alaska.
Weighing up to 1800 pounds, brown bears are also the national animal of finland.
I don't think you have to narrate.
But I liked where you were going with it, Boo Boo.
-I was hooked.
-really?
Yes.
Now try to film from flattering angles, if you know what I mean.
Pic-a-nic baskets may be delicious on the lips, but they're a lifetime on the hips.
Oh, no.
Ranger Smith!
Ranger Smith.
The mayor's here.
What's he doing here?
Why didn't he give us more warning?
I have to secure the area.
AII units, lock down the park.
Repeat, lock down the park.
Jones, you know I'm the only other ranger here, right?
Yeah.
-Ranger Smith, we need to talk.
-You could've just called.
BROWN:
Yeah, but I thought this would be more friendly.
I'm really working on my people skills.
Anyway, I am closing your park down.
-Okay.
-What?
Oh, yeah, this place just costs the city way too much money.
JeIIystone hasn't made its operating budget in 10 years.
You know, it's hard to compete with all those amusement parks--
Oh, hey, you're not kidding.
Oh, have you guys been to lincoln Log Land yet?
Oh, man, they have got a roller coaster there, it's made completely out of logs.
It's just like they rode in the pioneer days.
It's unbelievable.
Sir, JeIIystone is special.
Okay?
It's turning 100 years old this very year.
Why, it's a landmark.
I would never let it be closed down.
well, uh, you actually don't have a choice.
Have you read the city bylaws lately?
Chapter 6.
Section 73.
"Any municipal property that can't generate enough money to cover its operating budget can be rezoned for other uses."
And since JeIIystone loses money every year, we're shutting it down.
Uh, sorry?
[BOTH CHUCKLE]
-I thought that went well.
CHIEF:
Yeah.
SMITH:
Just a second, Mr. Mayor.
Who says we can't cover our budget?
Park doesn't report earnings till next quarter.
Yeah, which is like one week away.
Come on, Smith.
You gotta be $20,000 in the hole.
We wish.
Yeah.
Try 30,562.
That's probably a couple hundred extra for the map stand.
I think it's confession time.
-I only pretended to fix it.
-Thanks, Jones.
Sounds like you're in pretty deep there, Smith.
Maybe we are.
But this is one of the Iast places families can go to be close to nature.
The world needs that.
well, I'm not mayor of the world.
I'm mayor of this city.
And this city needs this park rezoned.
I'm sorry.
I feel awful about it.
Even though I Iook really good.
This is a new suit.
So, okay.
Maybe we don't have our operating budget today.
But you know what?
-A Iot can happen in a week.
-AII right.
Have it your way.
Take a week.
Hey, I'II even get you started.
What's the admission fee for one car again?
Four dollars.
Four dollars, huh?
Four whole dollars?
well, that changes everything.
Oh, my goodness.
well, I only need to come back in here like, uh, what, 10,000 more times?
[LAUGHING]
In a week!
Do I have time for that?
-impossible.
-Oh, shoot.
[WEIRD AL YANKOVIC'S "LASAGNA" PLAYING ON STEREO]
You want-a some-a lasagna?
You hungry, buddy?
Of course!
I'm always hungry.
I was talking to my pet turtle.
Here you go.
That better not be my beef jerky.
[TURTLE CHEWING]
[BELCHES]
So, what's the big deal, Yogi?
This is the big deal, Boo Boo.
It's my masterpiece.
The Basket-Nabber 2000.
The most advanced pic-a-nic basket-steaIing technology ever invented.
Wow.
climb aboard.
This glider can steer dive, shoot rubber bands at pesky-type birds and even has an air bag.
Had an air bag.
Sorry, Yogi.
Not to worry.
We could cushion our landing with all the pic-a-nic baskets we swipe.
Now, how's that copiIot seat feel?
A little wobbly, Iike it's not tied on very tight.
You won't feel that in the air.
Get ready to fly faster than the speed of sandwich, Boo Boo.
We're gonna break the pic-a-nic barrier.
SMITH:
Yogi!
-Uh-oh.
That's not his happy voice.
Don't move.
I'm switching the glider into stealth mode.
stealth mode?
Wow.
How are you able to--?
Oh.
Ah, Mr. Ranger, sir.
welcome.
Can I interest you in a sody pop?
-There you go.
-When did you steal our vending machine?
I, um-
- I'm repairing it, sir.
This machine gives its sodas away for free when a bear kicks it.
Look, a camper has reported some missing fishing poles so I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say it was you.
Fishing poles?
Sir, I'm a bear.
If I wanted to catch fish, I would just use my....
Your paws, Yogi.
Isn't that kind of unsanitary?
What's that?
-What's what?
-That thing.
-What thing?
-The thing under the blanket.
-blanket?
-The object right behind you.
Oh.
Oh, that.
Heh.
A sculpture.
I'm sculpting now.
mostly landscapes.
And where's Boo Boo?
-France.
-What?
-That's not close by, is it?
-No.
Then he's in the bathroom.
-Excuse me.
-Wait!
[STAMMERING]
Hey, this isn't the bathroom.
I'm telling you, Mr. Ranger, it's not for stealing pic-a-nic baskets.
It says "Basket-Nabber 2000" right here, Yogi.
I do regret calling it that now.
I know I'm always saying, "Stay away from the campers."
This is different.
JeIIystone is in real trouble.
If I don't raise $30,000 in a week, this park's getting rezoned.
Rezoned?
What does that mean?
It means the park won't be a park anymore.
The city will use this land for something else.
So we have got to do everything we can to help save it.
Which means you have gotta stop stealing food so that campers will leave here happy.
But they do leave here happy.
Getting your food stolen by Yogi Bear is special.
people come here for that.
It's like catching a foul ball at a baseball game.
Nope.
It's like getting your food stolen at a baseball game.
Come on, Yogi.
would it really be so hard to be a regular bear?
You know, to forage for food, to walk around on all fours to hibernate a little, or a Iot.
If nature had meant for me to be a regular bear it wouldn't have given me such a good thought-cooker, sir.
I can't help it if my melon is full of smart juice.
Yogi, your melon is hurting this park.
There are repercussions to stealing people's picnic baskets.
Not in my experience, sir.
[MECHANISM TICKING]
[BELL RINGS]
[GRUNTS]
On the other hand--
[SCREAMS]
Ranger Smith, mind if I borrow the 'diIIa?
It's an emergency.
Somebody parked without parking decals.
Jones, I would really prefer it if you focused on just maintaining the park instead.
Let me deal with the visitors until you've had more experience.
Sorry, sir.
Guess that's just the eagle Scout in me, you know?
always wanting to be in control, be a leader.
Live up to this fanny pack full of merit badges.
You know that fanny pack is for first aid supplies, right?
A merit badge in first aid is the only supply I need, sir.
Right, but it might not be the only supply a hurt person needs.
You seen rachel?
Yeah, I saw her.
She was heading up to Lookout Mountain.
She can't be far.
I'II drive.
Let's roll.
Jones.
The sprawling beauty of JeIIystone Park.
A timeless stretch of wilderness untouched by man.
Oh.
Ranger Smith.
Wow, heh.
What's with the fancy outfit?
Dress greens.
I always wear dress greens in the evening.
You know, in case there's, you know--
-I don't know how to talk to girls.
-Oh.
Why do you think I spend so much time with animals?
AII you have to do is scratch their backside and you've got a friend for life.
Try that with people and all of a sudden you're the weird girl on the bus that nobody wants to sit next to.
Um, uh, listen.
I was wondering, you know, if you were--
I mean, it's getting late and we could, uh-- If you want.
I mean, it's not that-
- You don't-
- It's--
You know, it's not a worry.
Don't worry.
Did you just ask me to dinner?
Yes.
I did.
Heh.
-Good, you got that, huh?
-Yes.
I just thought, well, it's getting late.
I happen to know this great place.
-Very gourmet.
-really?
Where?
So close you won't believe it.
Wow, how did you ever find this place?
This is a four-star porch.
And fresh from the hot plate, I give you...
-...rack of Spam.
-Oh.
Wow.
Maybe "gourmet" was a bit of a stretch.
No, it actually looks wonderful.
Great.
You know, this really is a peaceful place.
It's something, isn't it?
I pretty much grew up here.
My father was a ranger when I was a kid and he turned this park into the number one tourist destination in the state.
I mean, it was a park, you know?
Like families came by the hundreds swam in the streams, hiked on the trails.
It was really something.
This is really good.
Anyway, I don't know.
Maybe it's my fault.
I spent so many years learning everything I couId about the park so I'd be a better ranger.
Maybe instead, I should have come up with a gimmick to get people to come here.
You know, change the name to Extreme JeIIystone.
-I think that it's perfect just the way it is.
-You do?
You're right.
absolutely.
There's no better place on earth.
YOGI:
Hey, Mr. Ranger.
-Except a place without him.
Evening, Mr. Ranger, sir.
Madame Moviemaker Lady.
And yes, I'm using the fancy tense to show you the utmost respect.
Hi.
Ha, ha.
What do you want, Yogi?
well, I was thinking about the park's prickly predicament and I would Iike to do my part to help.
This is all the money I have saved.
almost $100.
I was going to use it on myself, but I'd rather donate it to JeIIystone.
well, thank you, Yogi.
That's--
That is very sweet.
-Where does a bear get money from?
-That brown box by the parking lot.
The park donation box.
Yep.
But I want you to have it.
Consider it a gift to JeIIystone.
That won't be hard.
Look, guys, I appreciate the effort.
But what this park needs is visitors and lots of them.
well, I can help you there, sir.
Just make me a headliner.
I will rock this place.
-Kick it, Boo Boo.
-Kicking it.
[SIR MIX-A-LOT'S "BABY GOT BACK" PLAYING] I like big butts and I cannot lie You other brothers can't deny
That when a girl walks in With a itty-bitty waist
And a round thing in your face You get sprung
[MUSIC STOPS]
That's not gonna work either, Yogi.
You're right.
We need something flashier than music.
Not a problem.
I've got this water-skiing routine that will change the face of entertainment.
Got a little of everything.
Music, stunts, magic.
-And I jump over Boo Boo at the end.
-No, you don't.
-I want to try it.
-I don't care.
I hate to interrupt, but you're not gonna water-ski or dance or do anything that might disturb the campers, okay?
If what you really want to do is help save this park you will lay low, stay away from people.
Think you can do that for me?
You have my word, Mr. Ranger.
I will be seen, but not heard.
Or seen.
Fine.
Huh?
You guys done with that Spam?
-Get out of here.
-Okay.
Sheesh!
Hey.
What's this?
Seasons pass applications.
unfortunately, not a Iot of takers on those.
Fifty bucks for an entire year?
including camping fees?
That's a bargain.
If this were a place people wanted to visit throughout the year.
Maybe Yogi was on to something.
-You said the park was turning 100, right?
-Right.
well, a big event could really pull people in.
Yeah, you're right.
We could have, Iike, a moss collection day or a big squirrel chase.
-Or....
-Fireworks.
Yes.
exactly.
Why didn't I think of that?
We could host a big centennial festival.
people always show up for fireworks.
If even half of the people buy season passes the park makes enough money to stay open.
Right.
Let's get the word out.
I think I can help with that.
[PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY]
That is great.
How did we pay for it?
We didn't.
It was some fast-food restaurant but I rearranged the letters right before the plane took off.
[BOTH CHUCKLE]
You're very cool, rachel Johnson.
You're pretty cool yourself.
I do have my own kind of natural swagger.
[SCREAMS]
JeIIystone national Park, 100th year anniversary.
There'II be fireworks.
Just stay calm, Jones.
You should be patrolling in the armadillo making park-impacting decisions, but--
-Hey, 100th year anniversary.
-Thanks.
But you're not there yet.
You still have to follow orders.
Even if those orders make you look like a giant Cheez-It.
Mr. Mayor!
Hi, Mr. Mayor.
Why is it only going halfway down again?
Doesn't make any-
- No!
Oh, okay.
Is it a double tap or do I have to press it--?
-Oh, dang it!
-I got it, sir.
Yeah.
That's exactly what I did.
Let me see one of those filers.
"Come celebrate JeIIystone's 100th anniversary with fireworks and fun."
"And receive $10 off a season pass"?
He's gonna try to make the budget selling season passes.
[BOTH GROAN]
Yeah, ugh.
It's not a very good idea, in my opinion.
But nobody consulted me, because my job is just to maintain the park which is basically poking trash with a stick.
Yeah.
Yeah, why is a guy with your talent doing this insulting grunt work?
You should be running a park.
Yeah, but Ranger Smith says I have to pay my dues.
-Excuse me?
-What?
-He has to pay his dues?
Ha.
-Ha, ha.
Nobody pays dues anymore.
You gotta be in charge now while you still know everything.
-That's what I've been saying.
-Yeah.
Buddy, if it was up to me, you would be the head ranger of JeIIystone already.
-You'd put me in charge?
-In a second.
Yes.
You know, if this centennial festival didn't work out, I probably could relocate Smith.
You know, uh, maybe you could help me with that.
Make sure it doesn't succeed?
Wait, you mean, Iike, sabotage it?
No.
Oh, no, no, no.
No, I want you to be head ranger.
It just so happens that the only way to do that is to bring down this festival.
But spend the rest of your life as second-in-command if you Iike.
That's fine.
It's a perfectly valid life choice.
well, you just think about it and give me a call, okay?
Here's my card.
So long.
Hey.
Now why is it doing that?
No.
Boy Scouts are loyal, thrifty, kind....
Hey, you're back.
Hey, thanks for getting those filers out.
Let me tell you, this festival is gonna be huge.
Hey, Ranger Smith, how long do you think until I reach head ranger status?
Oh, no time at all.
I did it in 12 short years.
Ha, okay.
Are you serious?
Just be patient, Jones.
It'II be here before you know it.
This festival's gonna be great!
I can't wait 12 years.
[PEOPLE CHEERING AND LAUGHING]
Seasons pass order forms.
Seasons pass order forms.
Thank you.
Seasons pass order forms, $10 off today.
Ah, enjoy.
I can't take it, Boo Boo.
Two days without a tasty treat to eat?
And I have to sit up here while they're having a "happy birthday, JeIIystone" party?
[SNIFFING]
And they have doughnuts.
Doughnuts!
BOO BOO [OVER RADIO]:
Yogi, what are you doing?
-Yogi!
-I'm going.
Hey.
Wait.
Don't do it, Yogi.
You promised Mr. Ranger.
You're right.
I'm losing control, Boo Boo.
I don't know who's steering the ship.
Here.
I want you to handcuff me to this tree and not unlock it no matter what I say.
Okay, Yogi.
-Okay, unlock me.
-Huh?
It was a bad idea.
unlock me.
[GRUNTING]
unlock me!
[GROWLING]
Okay.
Here you go.
JONES:
folks, I hate to say this, but there are no spots left.
Forecast called for thunderstorms.
Severe lightning.
I fear for your young ones.
[CAR HORN HONKING]
We're out of fireworks, I'm afraid.
It's just sparkIers left.
Oh, no.
You look nice.
Your napkin matches your tie.
I don't need you to kiss up to me.
Got this guy for that.
That's a good point, sir.
You were gonna handle this situation, yet there are quite a few people here.
Sir, I tried.
AII last night I spent taking down fIiers.
I blocked the entrance with a vehicle to back up traffic.
I hung up "rabid squirrel" signs everywhere.
Those were hand-drawn.
-Nothing is working.
-You need to think of something, don't you?
Or maybe you're just not head ranger material.
Mr. Mayor.
Mayor's yes man.
So glad you could join us.
I saved you a nice spot next to the porta-potties.
Oh, well, thank you.
well, that's very thoughtful.
You know, I'm just so glad that these festivities are going so well, Smith.
I just hope nothing goes wrong.
[HORN HONKING]
We are gonna pull this off, Jonesy.
I've seen hundreds of people filling out seasons pass order forms.
The weather's great.
The fireworks, ready to go.
Even Yogi's staying out of the way.
Yogi.
[GROANING]
Hey, guys.
Sorry, just wandering around, bored out of my mind.
Bored?
But the 100th anniversary extravaganza's going on.
Yeah, more like 100th anniversary Iame-aganza.
You know, because it's so lame.
people see fireworks every day in the city.
They thought they'd see something different here.
I knew it.
I should be out there doing my water-ski routine.
I'm a shining star and Ranger Smith is holding me back.
I don't know, Yogi.
Mr. Ranger is usually right about these things.
No, Boo Boo, Ranger Smith is in denial.
I mean, he's lost it, you know?
I saw him a couple days ago.
He was filling his pockets with dirt.
He said he's gonna start moving the park to his apartment piece by piece.
-How big is his apartment?
-There's still time.
I won't be able to do the haIf-hour artistic program but that was more for me anyway.
These people need the razzIe-dazzIe.
I don't think we've practiced the razzIe-dazzIe.
You're not supposed to, Boo Boo.
That's where it gets the razzle.
Yogi, I really don't think we shouId--
Boo Boo, you've tried to stop my brilliant ideas with common sense a thousand times.
Has it ever worked?
No.
Then let's go, go, go.
What does that taste like?
unemployment?
-I'm sorry.
-Yeah.
Thanks again for helping with the fireworks.
I don't know where Jones disappeared to.
My pleasure.
You know, um, rachel, I've been wanting to tell you...
-...well, how much I--
-Ranger--
No, please, Iet me get through this.
I'm not very good with words.
But I have never felt so gushy.
Ha-ha-ha.
-You know?
-Ranger--
You know what I did?
I went and I wrote a song about you.
It's like this:
[HUMMING]
Oh, no.
[SINGING] I saw you at the station
Had a heart palpitation
My sickness was love And you're the medication
Rachel
-Rachel
-The microphone is on.
SMITH:
And it comes around again
Rachel, Rachel, Rachel
The microphone is on.
Yes, the mic--
[CLEARS THROAT THEN LAUGHS]
Hi.
hello and welcome to the 100th anniversary of JeIIystone!
[CHEERING]
Thank you.
It is so wonderful to see so many people here today.
I've noticed many of you filling out your seasons pass order forms.
We're more than happy to collect those after the fireworks.
But first, please, sit back, get comfortable and enjoy the show!
-Terrific.
-Mr.
Mayor?
[POISON'S "NOTHIN' BUT A GOOD TIME" PLAYING ON STEREO]
That's not the right music.
I'II take it from here, Mr. Ranger!
Oh, no.
full speed ahead, Boo Boo.
Okay.
Not bad, eh, Boo Boo?
Looking good, Yogi.
-This cannot be happening.
-Oh, it's happening.
[YOGI STAMMERING]
hello, JeIIystone!
[CROWD CHEERING]
No, don't encourage him!
They love me.
I can do no wrong.
Watch this.
AII right, Boo Boo!
Turn up the heat!
Phase two, go.
I'm an unstoppable water-skiing machine.
[LAUGHING]
Ta-da!
Oh, wait.
There's more.
How about if I heat things up?
[SMITH WHIMPERS]
[GROANING]
Don't need nothin' but a good time
And it don't get better than this
Yogi!
Yogi, your cape.
I know.
It is magnificent.
And on fire.
Huh?
Fire!
[GROANING]
-Turn the boat!
-Huh?
-Turn, Boo Boo!
-Hang on, Yogi!
Too much razzIe!
[CROWD SCREAMING]
[GASPS]
-Nice one.
-Thanks.
[RACHEL GASPS]
Jump!
[CHUCKLING]
[CHEERING]
[ALL GASP]
[MURMURING]
Let's go.
[SCREAMING AND SHOUTING]
MAN:
Out of my way!
[CHUCKLING]
This could not have gone more perfectly.
Hey, you got a little, uh....
Never mind.
Let's go.
[SIGHS]
[WOOD SNAPPING AND CREAKING]
Mr. Ranger, I thought--
Yogi, that's the problem.
AII the thinking.
Hey, you know what would be great?
If you didn't think.
If you could just be a regular bear.
You know, sitting in the woods, minding his own business.
But no, you're different.
You're smart.
And you'd rather spend your days being selfish and destructive while everyone else pays the price.
But I guess it wasn't enough, screwing up my Iife.
No, this time you had to go and bring down this entire park.
So tell me, Yogi how smart are you now?
Hey, there!
That was quite a show you put on yesterday.
Ha-ha-ha.
I can't wait to see what you do with this.
That's your new assignment.
Evergreen Park.
Oh, I think you're just going to find it delightful.
Oh, and, uh, Ranger Jones is gonna be taking over here.
Ranger Jones?
well, I have got a press conference to plan.
You see, it turns out I've saved the city.
Don't forget to vote, my friend.
Brown for governor!
Ha-ha-ha.
He's not gonna vote for me, is he?
Uh, no.
You did everything you could.
Doesn't matter.
This park needed a ranger who could make it popular again.
I'm just some guy who knows how old every tree is.
Fat lot of good that did JeIIystone.
Face it.
You and I are just two people who care about things that nobody else does and that's why we're alone.
Or maybe that's why we found each other.
Did you ever think of that?
rachel, you and this park have one thing in common.
You both deserve a better man than me.
I can't believe he's really gone.
Yogi, are you okay?
I'm done being special, Boo Boo.
Ranger Smith was right.
My whole life, I've been different.
But it's done nothing but hurt people.
The world would be better off if I was only as smart as the average bear.
Yogi, what are you doing?
I'm leaving, Boo Boo.
-I am going to forage for food in the wild.
-Huh?
Might even catch some fish.
With my paws.
[SIGHS]
I'm just gonna grab a little something for the road.
Some chips and soda.
And this.
Peach pie.
Any more of that casserole?
Top shelf.
I'II be out there.
Fending for myself.
Foraging for food in the wild.
[METAL CLANKING]
Goodbye, horsepower Iimiter.
There's a new head ranger in town.
Let's see what you got.
[GRUNTING]
Perfect.
[SOBBING]
I'm sorry, Ranger Smith.
No more food.
No more pic-a-nickers.
How could this get any worse?
[THUNDER BOOMING]
Oh.
Ah, Evergreen Park.
Yes, it is simply delightful.
[GIGGLING]
-Come on.
-I've got it, sir.
This is unbelievable.
Ah, Evergreen Park.
lovely, isn't it?
This isn't a park.
I can barely breathe in here.
Look at these trees.
They're all plastic.
Oh, no, they're real.
It's just years of smog and pollution have left a pIastic-Iike coating on them.
Think people will be happy you're closing the most beautiful park in the state?
well, they will be when they find out it's making the city rich and giving each citizen a check for $1000.
How is that even possible?
Oh, well, it turns out that there has been some agricultural interest in the park.
And it's a Iot more profitable than people in station wagons making s'mores.
[LAUGHING]
Have a good day, Ranger Smith.
I hate this car.
I hate it.
[GRUNTS]
[CHAINSAWS BUZZING]
Yeah!
Oh, hey, there he is.
Ha-ha-ha.
Whoa, hey, Mr. Mayor!
I, uh....
Just finishing some stamping.
You are doing great, Jones.
I knew you were the guy for this job.
Quick thing.
You'II probably notice some giant trucks rumbling by.
We're just clearing a little patch of trees for my press conference.
No big deal.
Um, wait, you're cutting down trees?
Oh, yeah.
well, just a few.
It's nothing to worry about.
actually gonna improve the park quite a bit.
I'II bet one of the first things you noticed as head ranger is that you need more clear spaces here, and you are absolutely right.
Now you can host concerts and Boy Scout jamborees.
That's a pretty smart move there, Head Ranger Jones.
I have some other park improvements I want to run by you.
Oh, splendid, yes.
I think I have a few moments to hear those.
Look into the security arrangements for tomorrow.
I don't want any surprises.
I'II hear what Ding-Dong has to say.
What do you got?
I'm hungrier than the average bear.
I wish I couId find a bush that tasted like birthday cake.
Gotcha.
[GROANS]
Pretend it's a gummy worm.
Pretend it's a gummy worm.
[GASPS]
Yogi, I've been looking everywhere for you.
Not now, Boo Boo.
I'm busy foraging.
[GROANS]
[SHOUTS]
Come on, Yogi.
JeIIystone is in trouble.
We need your help.
Nothing I can do, Boo Boo.
I'm average now.
My brain is out of business.
I wouldn't even be standing if my paws didn't hurt.
Quit feeling sorry for yourself.
You know you're not an average bear.
Hey, hey, Boo Boo.
You're right, I'm not.
I failed at that too.
Hey, come back here.
You've gotta save JeIIystone.
YOGI:
What are you doing?
I'm not--
Yogi, you have to use your smarts for good.
And if you can't see that, maybe you are just an average bear.
Come on.
[GRUNTING]
Now do you understand?
What's going on, Boo Boo?
I don't know.
But whatever it is I think they're just getting started.
Boo Boo get my collar.
Nobody is gonna hurt JeIIystone.
Where are we going, Yogi?
We can't get JeIIystone back alone, Boo Boo.
My thinker is good, but Ranger Smith's is better.
He was going to a place called Evergreen Park.
That's right.
In the city.
The city?
That's a Iong walk.
Don't be silly, Boo Boo.
I've already got a smarty-smart cheat to keep our feet off the street.
Get ready for it.
Here it comes.
Run, Boo Boo, run!
Hurry, Boo Boo.
I think we gotta jump for it.
Ready?
AII aboard.
Good.
Yogi, grab my paw.
[GROANING]
[GRUNTING]
Sorry.
[YOGI SHOUTING]
Boo Boo, Boo Boo, Boo Boo!
I gotta get--!
I guess it makes a stop here.
Yup.
Looks like Evergreen Park is about two miles away from here.
Two miles?
I'II have to tap into my emergency rations.
Snack break.
Come on, Yogi.
We need to keep moving.
It's not that far and it's all downhill.
downhill?
Excuse me, Mr. Dirty Shopper.
Any chance my friend and I might borrow your wheeIy-basket?
Is that chocolate?
[YOGI AND BOO BOO LAUGHING]
Okay, Boo Boo, keep it steady.
I'm okay, Ma.
Just--
Yeah, no, it's not JeIIystone, but at Ieast there's nothing here to drive me crazy.
-Hey, Mr. Ranger.
-Hey, Yogi.
[CART CRASHES]
AII right, Ma, I gotta call you back.
What are you guys doing here?
We need your help, Mr. Ranger, sir.
But don't worry, my days of goofing things up for you are over.
MAN:
Hey, move that shopping cart!
[SHOUTING]
I'm okay!
I'm just gonna put this over here.
What do you want?
I don't have a life left for you to ruin anymore.
Sir, I know I messed things up and I'm sorry.
I never meant to.
You and Boo Boo are the best friends I ever had.
And I've never done anything but think of myself.
And now JeIIystone is just gonna be a big field of stumps.
What?
They've started cutting down the trees.
"agricultural interest" is logging.
Oh, no, not our JeIIystone.
We have to save it, sir.
I don't think we can save it, Yogi.
I'm no smarter than you.
I lost JeIIystone.
I lost rachel.
It's over.
Mr. Ranger, I've learned two things from stealing pic-a-nic baskets.
One:
light mayonnaise is not nearly as good as regular mayonnaise.
And two: you can't fall if you never stop trying.
You have to fight for the things you love whether it's a park, a girl or a roast beef sandwich.
Don't give up now.
We're all JeIIystone's got.
You're right, Yogi.
JeIIystone's too important to give up on.
We gotta try.
Come on.
-Shotgun.
-Aw.
I never thought I'd see this.
Happy 100th anniversary, JeIIystone.
Isn't that Miss Movie Lady?
RACHEL:
I gotta get in there.
You don't understand.
Let me in, please.
No can do.
Park is closed to the public until the press conference.
Mayor's orders.
Then go talk to him.
tell him what I told you.
I'm sorry.
I don't really take orders from a--
I lived with gorillas, pal.
I know rage.
You do not want me to go gorilla on you.
[SCREAMS]
Uh, I'II speak to the mayor.
-Thank you.
-Okay.
rachel.
Ranger Smith.
I didn't think I'd ever see you again.
I know.
I don't know what I was thinking.
I think you're perfect.
I think any guy in the world would be lucky just to stand next to you.
You really mean that?
Of course I do.
It's just, when I lost JeIIystone, I felt like such a failure.
But losing you has felt much, much worse.
I'm like....
I'm like a genus without a phylum.
That's the sweetest thing anyone's ever said to me.
-So, um, we're still here.
YOGI:
Mm-hm.
Oh, right.
Ahem.
So, what are you doing here?
-Come on, I'II show you.
-Okay.
I was reviewing the documentary footage from Boo Boo's camera and I saw this.
Oh, my.
I see it.
I have a bald spot back there!
I'm not talking about you, Yogi.
I'm talking about this.
Yeah, it's my pet turtle.
He hangs out at the cave all the time.
True.
You know they don't come out of that shell?
I tried one time to see what one would look like without it.
But, nope, they're sewn in.
This is no regular turtle.
See the bulging frog-Iike eyes and the really wide mouth?
A frog-mouthed turtle?
Yup, Rafetus swinhoei.
SMITH:
But those are extinct.
For a hundred years, but apparently one still exists.
And he lives in there.
But they won't let me through the gates to go find him.
But if JeIIystone has an endangered species living in it, then--
It has to be protected as a park.
That's the Iaw.
That turtle can save this park.
Now I feel kinda bad about using him as a foot stool.
CHIEF:
You've seen the filmmaker?
well, we spoke.
About extinct turtles.
You're telling me there is an extinct turtle living here in the park?
According to Miss Johnson's film, there is.
An extinct turtle?
That's great.
Visitors will come from miles around to see an endangered species.
Yes, they will, and that is great.
We need to find this turtle.
Just to keep it safe.
Have a vet check it out.
The whole deal.
The sooner we get to him the better.
Oh, we need a head ranger who's good enough to find it.
Someone who thinks like a turtle.
I am that head ranger.
well, then why are you still here?
He's back.
Come on.
You need to let us in this park.
That turtle needs protection.
Don't worry about the turtle.
We're handling it.
We'II make sure he's put in a nice zoo.
No.
A turtle that's endangered can't be removed from its natural habitat.
It's against federal law.
It is?
Wow, I've never heard of that law in chapter 4, subsection 6 of the wildlife Protection Mandate.
Don't worry, Mr. Ranger, sir.
That turtle is safe.
These people have no idea where my cave is.
The turtle's in the talking bear's cave.
JONES [OVER RADIO]:
Copy.
Wow, that backfired.
Okay.
You know what?
Fine,
You win.
What are you doing?
I have a plan.
One of the advantages of having lived here since I was a kid is I know this park like the back of my hand.
Let's go!
hold on, boys.
AII right.
Hey, there, little buddy.
hello, there.
Uh-oh.
Sorry about that.
-Mayor Brown.
-This had better be good, Jones.
JONES:
I found the turtle.
He was in Boo Boo's sleeping bag.
But now I have him secure at the picnic area.
Jones, you're a hero.
Sit tight.
My chief of staff is on his way to get him.
Copy that.
Head Ranger Jones over and out.
SMITH:
He found the turtle.
Dang it.
Can't cross those rapids.
There's no way to get to him from here.
well, there is one way.
There it is.
My masterpiece.
-You really think you can pull this off?
-I know I can, sir.
I'm gonna snatch that basket-type turtle box and fly away like a fuzzy bird.
And I've got the best copiIot a basket-snatching machine could have.
-I don't know how to fly this thing.
-well, you'II pick it up as we go.
SMITH:
Okay.
Look, just be careful, okay, Yogi?
Copy that, ground control.
Basket-Nabber 2000 ready for takeoff.
-flight systems check.
Boo Boo?
-What?
-Can you reach the pedals?
-If I point my toes.
flight systems are go.
Remember what I told you about flying gliders, Yogi.
Don't fight the wind.
As long as the wind wants me to snatch up that turtle, we'II get along just fine.
-AII right.
YOGI:
Start pedaling, Boo Boo.
AII right.
Here goes.
YOGI:
hold on, Boo Boo.
Fasten your seat belt.
But there isn't one.
YOGI:
Here we go!
BOO BOO:
Oh, Yogi!
The wind should carry you south!
We'II meet you there!
Take your time, Mr. Ranger.
This machine is equipped with landing gear.
We'II touch down as soft as a feather.
Whoops.
This is your captain speaking.
We'II reach our turtle target in about two minutes.
So let's go ahead and start the beverage service.
-Yogi, look out.
-Aah!
-Trees!
-Yes, trees!
[BOTH SCREAMING]
I got it.
I got it.
I got it.
I don't got it!
BOO BOO:
pull up.
-Hey!
-pull up!
You did it, Yogi.
Oh.
Yeah.
Ha-ha-ha.
Great job, Jones.
I'II get this guy to the city zoo.
-The city zoo?
-Yep.
They got a nice spot ready in the reptile house.
The city zoo doesn't have a reptile house.
They're building one.
-Who is?
-builders.
Sure you're trying to protect the turtle?
Yeah, we love turtles.
Then you won't mind if I hold onto him until I notify the wildlife Federation, right?
AII right.
You're gonna find this out in a few hours anyway, so I might as well tell you.
We gotta lose this turtle to sell logging rights to the park.
Logging?
The whole park?
Yeah, but who cares?
It's still a park, just without trees.
And they'II grow back.
Yeah, in like 200 years.
It doesn't matter.
Your career is what matters.
Ha-ha-ha.
turtle target acquired.
I need 20 more feet of altitude.
Engage the hand pedals.
You couldn't put the hand pedals by you?
There's a suggestion box behind the seat, Boo Boo.
[GROANS]
Wait, you don't want to approach him like that.
He's poisonous.
He's in a basket.
But he can spit.
Poison.
He'II aim at your eyes.
melt them out of your head.
-I'm telling you, that turtle is deadly.
-What are you looking at?
-Hook me in, Boo Boo.
-Okay.
And fire!
Here you go.
Huh?
Yogi, wait!
Here I come!
He's going for the turtle.
-Mind if I borrow this?
-Hey!
[YOGI LAUGHS]
Look, Boo Boo!
We got the turtle!
Hey, why aren't you in your seat?
That bear knows how to steal a basket.
Everybody after that glider now!
I'm not gonna let a bear make me look bad.
Been there, buddy.
We're drifting too far right.
I wanna get us outside the park.
Don't fight the wind, Yogi.
Remember what Miss Movie Lady said about--
Never mind.
YOGI:
Hang on, Boo Boo.
-What do we do now?
Did you check the safety manual?
It's just a picture of us screaming.
[BOTH SCREAMING]
We've got to deject, Boo.
Don't you mean eject?
Eject is up.
Deject is down.
In case of emergency your seat can also be used as a flotation device!
[YOGI LAUGHING]
[GRUNTING]
Hey, told you.
Nothing to worry about.
I actually think I wasn't worried enough.
Let me see how our little passenger is doing.
Wonder why they call him a frog-mouthed turtle anyway?
Hey!
SMITH:
Hey, guys, over here!
Yogi, grab the branch.
Got you, Mr. Ranger, sir.
[SMITH AND RACHEL GRUNT]
-welcome aboard.
SMITH:
Yogi.
We were trying to get you off the raft.
Yeah, that makes more sense.
You guys did it.
You saved him.
[CAR HORN HONKS]
Oh, no.
They're gonna catch us downstream.
I'm on it.
No, Yogi, don't.
problem solved.
They can't catch us now.
Yeah, because now we are headed straight for the JeIIyjarring Rapids.
[GRUNTS]
-Grab a paddle.
-Tuck your head in, little buddy.
Brace yourselves.
Oh, come on, turtle.
Don't worry, I put safety belts in this raft for just such an occasion.
You better hang on.
Mr. Ranger said--
YOGI:
We're gonna be fine, Boo Boo.
Just sit back and let Mother Nature carry us to--
[ALL SCREAMING]
I think Mother Nature's kind of cranky today.
You okay, Yogi?
Fine!
turtle!
YOGI:
Who's that?
I can't see.
Come here, turtle.
-Got him.
SMITH:
Good work, Boo Boo.
We made it through the rapids.
Yeah, but that means the falls are just up ahead.
hold on!
[SCREAMING]
Yogi.
Yogi.
Now who says there are no rides at JeIIystone?
Yeah, you've definitely got the thrill part down.
ANNOUNCER:
Please, take your seats.
The press conference is about to begin.
That's over a mile away.
We're never gonna make that in time.
[ALL GASP]
-Ranger Jones?
-I messed up pretty bad, sir.
-I know.
It's okay.
-I wanted to be head ranger.
Because you're a good head ranger and I value leadership.
I have a merit badge--
Can we talk later?
We're pressed for time.
Yes.
Get in.
[SIREN WAILING]
YOGI:
Boo Boo!
Boo Boo!
Wait up!
SMITH:
well, well.
Guess who we found.
Starts with T and ends with a-- "UrtIe"?
It's over.
call off the logging.
The law says this park is now a protected nature preserve.
You think I care about what the Iaw says?
Or about some endangered "frog-mouthed turtle"?
Or some stupid park for families to have a picnic in?
I care about power, you pinheads!
And I'm gonna get it.
Nobody knows this turtle exists.
And nobody ever will.
You found the turtle.
Get this thing out of here before anybody else sees it.
-rachel!
-Oh!
Yogi!
BOO BOO:
Yogi, here!
Thank you.
-Yogi.
-I'm sorry.
He was open.
Ha, ha.
Now if you'II excuse me, I have a press conference.
I can still tell them what you did.
Oh, yeah?
Without that turtle or a scrap of evidence, go right ahead.
well, you might as well tell them Bigfoot is here.
Ha-ha-ha.
And do yourself a favor, there, ranger.
Try to keep your dignity.
It's all you have left.
You know what?
I'm taking care of this thing myself this time.
That's the only way to make sure the job is done right.
But that's why I'm the mayor's right-hand man, right?
Because I don't make mistakes.
Hey, you know, people are wondering:
"Why should I vote for Mayor Brown to be governor?"
well, how about this:
Mayor Brown just turned the city's budget from a deficit into a surplus!
And put $1000 into the pocket of every citizen of this city!
Now before I sign the paperwork that will save the city why don't you all take a look at my first campaign ad for governor?
ANNOUNCER:
Mayor Brown, the right choice for governor.
We're out of time.
Must be something we can do.
Anybody have any ideas?
well, I guess this is going to be a pretty sad documentary, huh?
Are you--?
Is he still filming?
I needed more footage, so I told him to keep it rolling.
I can plug that into the video feed right up there.
I just need a way to distract the guards.
I think we can take care of that.
ANNOUNCER:
He supports public safety.
[JOURNEY'S "DON'T STOP BELIEVING" PLAYING ON TV]
All right, hurry up, people.
Focus.
Let's go save those orphans.
YOGI:
Hey, hey, hey, check this out!
-Kick it, Boo Boo.
-Kicking it.
Don't stop believing
[LAUGHING]
Hold on to that feeling
ANNOUNCER:
He's tough on crime.
[SHOUTS]
Hey, hey, hey, look at this.
Keep your eye on the little bear.
Look at the skills.
Amazing!
[GRUNTING]
ANNOUNCER:
And here's what Mayor Brown proudly has to say about protecting our natural resources.
[MUSIC STOPS]
You think I care about what the law says?
Or about some endangered "frog-mouthed turtle"?
-Some stupid park for families to picnic in?
-No.
No.
No. I care about power, you pinheads!
Oh, boy.
Nobody knows this turtle exists.
And nobody ever will.
[BOOING AND JEERING]
[LAUGHING]
There's about to be a riot out there.
I need you out front.
[GRUNTS]
Okay.
No.
Hey, wait.
Wait, wait, wait.
please, please, please.
That was not real.
Trust me, there is no such thing as a frog-mouthed turtle.
He's right next to me, isn't he?
Okay.
-We did it, Yogi!
-Up high, Boo Boo!
-AII right!
JONES:
We got it!
Yogi!
AII right, and now....
Miss Moviemaker Lady.
SMITH:
Hey, we did it.
[LAUGHING]
Hey, Mr. Ranger!
RACHEL:
Come on, Boo Boo.
-Okay.
I was wrong, Yogi.
I say from here on, we just be proud of who we are and fight for the things we're passionate about, Iike this park.
And rachel.
And pic-a-nic baskets?
And pic-a-nic baskets.
-Aw, come here!
-No, you don't have to--
Okay.
AII right, that's--
I'm good.
[CROWD CHATTERING]
RACHEL:
Here you go, Boo Boo.
Take good care of him.
Hey, there, buddy.
No, no, no, I never took a kickback on anything in my entire career.
No one loves turtles more than I do.
And nature in general.
I Iove trees.
Oh, no, you don't!
[GROWLS]
gorilla?
HimaIayan snow leopard.
Huh.
welcome to JeIIystone, home of the frog-mouthed turtle.
And brochures.
I'm Ranger Jones.
NARRATOR:
Ah, yes, Jellystone Park.
A wonderful little piece of paradise.
Where families come and soak up the tranquility of nature.
It's a place that--
[MACHINE WHIRRING]
Huh?
Never mind.
MAN:
Hey, hey, hey!
[CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY]
Hi.
welcome.
well, I am certainly glad that you are gonna be staying in JeIIystone for a while.
And what animal will you be observing?
well, I thought I would observe the courting rituals of the American ranger.
I happen to hear the American ranger is a very charming intelligent, attractive species.
One that always keeps his cool.
Even when basket-steaIing bears push his buttons?
Listen, Yogi will be Yogi.
And I'm just not gonna let it bother me anymore.
Besides I have more important things to focus on.
Oh....
[LAUGHING]
I....
Let's-
- Let's try that again.
[HORN HONKING]
[GASPING]
Afternoon, Mr. Ranger, sir!
Hi, Miss Movie Lady!
[BARKING]
Yogi!
I Iove this place.
SMITH:
Yogi!
Hey!
[BlackjesusRG @ 1337x.org]
NARRATOR:
Jellystone Park.
One of the nation's oldest and most beautiful stretches of wilderness.
For years, families have headed out from the busy city eager to enjoy a little camping, fishing and, of course, observing the park's natural wildlife.
Boo Boo, I think it's time I introduced myself to that pic-a-nic basket.
You know, Yogi, we could just hunt for food.
All the other animals do.
Boo Boo, a pic-a-nic basket has everything a bear needs.
And I'm not just talking about the treats and snack-type goodies.
No.
A pic-a-nic basket holds a lot more than that.
It holds dreams.
[whispering] What are we looking at?
I don't know.
Hook me in.
[IN NORMAL VOICE] You sure it'll work, Yogi?
Well, you know, Boo Boo, I'm smarter than the average bear!
[SHOUTING]
[chuckling]
All right!
[GASPS]
[SHOUTING]
[GRUNTS]
[chuckling]
[GROANS]
MAN:
Ranger Smith!
Sorry about that.
We got a 4-23 in Redwood Valley, sir.
- A what?
- A bear disturbance.
- l think it's probably-- - l know who it is.
Why didn't you just say "bear disturbance"?
Well, I....
Uh, well, it sounds cooler.
I mean, we're park rangers, sir.
You know:
"To protect and preserve."
Did you just make that motto up?
Yeah, I did.
Do you like it?
Ranger Jones, you know that, well, being a park ranger, it's not about mottos.
It's about keeping the park safe.
That's where the glory is.
Protecting all of this.
Yeah, I know.
Besides, that motto was still in the testing phase.
It's not like I made T-shirts or anything.
Heh, no, of course not.
Okay, I'm gonna deal with that 4-23.
Okay, copy that, sir.
Um, I'm actually gonna hop in the Armadillo, make some rounds.
Jones, you know that the Armadillo is for head ranger use only.
I might need it at any moment to deal with a park emergency.
Why don't you finish stacking those trail maps?
Yeah, sure.
Okay.
Yeah, because that's what future head rangers do, they stack maps.
Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy!
Our days of getting banged up to grab a meal are over, Boo Boo.
From now on, the pic-a-nic baskets are going to fall into our arms.
Soldering iron.
BOO BOO:
Here you go.
- Thank you.
Okay.
That should do it.
Test rock.
Okay, Yogi.
YOGI:
Weight sensor triggered.
Basket in position.
Launch spring starts coiling.
Firing pin drops.
And....
[BELL RINGS]
Bull's-eye!
I'm so smart it hurts!
You're standing on the soldering iron.
Or it's that.
[SHOUTING]
Hot, hot, hot!
There's the test rock.
Now we just wait here for a pic-a-nic basket to fall into our arms.
Are you sure about this, Yogi?
People seem to get pretty mad when you--
A genius never questions his instincts, Boo Boo.
When you have a mind like mine you can't blink or you'll put a kink in your think.
Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.
We've got our first customers.
And they have pie!
I wonder what kind it is.
smith:
Yogi, are you out here?
- lt's Mr. Ranger.
- Aah!
Get rid of the test rock.
Destroy the evidence. I was never here.
smith:
Look-
- Ow!
Hello, Mr. Ranger, sir.
Did you just--?
Did you guys--?
Did you--?
Oh, never mind.
Look, there was a complaint about a bear interfering with a family picnic.
I see.
And you'd like us to mount some sort of investigation?
No, I think it was you.
What?
!
How can you even think that?
Are you feverish?
Let me press my lips against your forehead.
Wait!
You're not pressing your lips against my forehead.
Hey, it's a lot better than the way they take my temperature.
[CHUCKLES]
No, look, Yogi, we've been over this many times.
Bears are supposed to avoid people, not run around stealing their food.
I agree, sir.
That's why my friend Boo Boo and I would never think of disturbing a family's pic-a-nic.
[BELL RINGS AND WOOD CLUNKS]
[WOMAN SCREAMS]
Huh.
It missed.
[GROANS]
Good day, Mr. Ranger, sir.
We'll keep our eyes peeled.
I wonder if he noticed the pie.
JONES [CHOPPY OVER RADIO]:
Ra-
- Smith.
You have a vis-
- Over.
Didn't understand a word of that, Jones.
- Sorry.
Some lady's here to see you.
- Send her in.
- Okay.
I'll be in the Armadillo.
- Or you could be....
- Map stacking?
- Map stacking.
- Ranger Smith?
- Yes.
- Hello. I'm Rachel Johnson.
- Hi.
I was hoping to talk to you about filming a documentary here.
Sure. I can handle you for that.
Handle that for you.
Sorry.
My work isn't-- My brain isn't working right.
- l must have inhaled some jimsonweed.
- Oh.
Datura stramonium.
It's known to cause delirium...
- ...cramping and nausea.
Heh.
- Cramping and nausea.
You've read The North American Wilderness Guide.
Yeah, I like to highlight all the plants and animals I see.
- l like to-
- Me too.
- Ha, ha!
Yeah.
[smith STAMMERING]
Ranger Smith.
At your service.
You want to film a documentary in Jellystone?
Yes.
I sent you a letter about a month ago.
- Written on a piece of bark.
- That was you!
Yes. I'm sorry about that.
I was in Sumatra, living among the orangutans at the time and they get very nervous if they spot anything from the modern world.
Really?
Wow, that's amazing.
Then what did you use for ink?
Bird poop and spit.
Impressive.
So, what are you here to film?
Well, I was hoping to shoot a local species.
Something to really capture the beauty of a national park.
Terrific.
What animal were you thinking?
I heard you had an unusual brown bear.
- Brown bear?
- Yes.
One that talks?
Those are so rare.
- None that I can think of.
- Named Yogi?
Wears a hat and a tie?
No, that doesn't ring a bell.
I think he's standing on the roof, trying to steal your lunchbox.
YOGI:
I smell PB and J.
[YOGI shouting]
I'm all done.
Oh, right.
That Yogi.
Bankrupt?
No, no, no.
We're a city.
Cities don't go bankrupt.
They do when they're broke, sir.
We just have to find some money somewhere.
I'm about to run for governor.
How am I gonna do that when my own city is bankrupt?
Okay, yes.
Thank you.
- Here's the invoice, Mr. Mayor.
- Yikes!
Wow.
Ha.
I'm gonna pretend I didn't see that.
Just bill it to the city, okay?
Thank you.
Ugh.
How did we ever go so broke?
- l think we just spent too much.
- Hmm.
Is there anything we can sell?
You already sold the public golf course to condo developers two of the three fire stations to that frozen yogurt company.
You were selling the library, but it burned down.
Oh, yeah.
That was gonna be one of those make-your-own-doughnut places.
- No.
- Yeah.
- lf you could dream it up, you could make it.
- Ah.
Love those.
We gotta think of something here.
Well, if we don't have anything to sell, maybe we can profit off what we can't sell.
I don't understand those words.
Like when we sold the bottling rights to the water in Lake Beuclair.
- We made a fortune.
- Yeah.
Sinkhole Beuclair is a great place to throw old mattresses.
- Oh, yeah.
- Hmm.
We just don't have any more resources to exploit.
Or do we?
Jellystone.
If we rezone Jellystone Park as agricultural land, we can sell the logging rights.
Here.
This company says they'll give us thousands of dollars an acre just to cut down the trees or something.
That'll be enough to balance the budget and give each citizen a big fat check.
[laughing]
You have any idea how many votes that'll buy me?
- Enough to be the next governor?
- Exactly.
You're fine, Yogi.
It's just a few scrapes and bruises.
I don't know, Mr. Ranger.
I'm pretty sure I heard my spine snap.
Well, you wouldn't be able to stand.
And you wouldn't be able to eat.
I'm okay!
Yogi, Boo Boo, I would like to introduce you to Rachel Johnson who's here to make a nature documentary.
[GROWLS]
What the heck was that?
I was saying hello.
I lived in a den with brown bears for six months.
Only bear I've ever lived with is Boo Boo.
And he only makes that sound after he's eaten baked beans.
Heh, heh.
I have problems with baked beans.
And for a little bear, he makes a lot of stink.
Okay, I have some fantastic river otters you can film instead.
- Could get a hat and tie on the slow one.
- No, you know, I really, really like these two.
- Would you guys mind if I shoot you?
YOGI:
Huh?
[rapid FOOTSTEPS]
Yogi, I think she meant with a camera.
Yes.
Of course with a camera.
Heh-heh-heh.
I knew that.
But not just any camera.
This isn't gonna make me look fat, is it?
RACHEL:
No, you are gonna look great.
Okay, just a few more adjustments.
[whispering] Please, excuse the pre-tied bow tie.
My mornings are often rushed.
It's fine, Boo Boo.
This is going to be a whole new perspective for a documentary.
The Boo Boo cam will capture the true wilderness in all its natural glory.
No other human in sight.
That sounds like my apartment.
Ha, ha.
Uh, you know, because I live alone.
Well, plenty of women have tried to change that.
It's just, I haven't found one that--
- Likes you?
- What?
No.
No, that--
Will return your calls?
Can you stop helping, please?
Sir, I can see you like this lady.
But your courting rituals need work.
What you need to do is follow her around for two days making snorting sounds.
Then fight any male that looks at her.
And then, of course, urinate on her to mark her as your territory.
Works every time.
I got it under control, Yogi.
- Boo Boo, you're rolling.
- Cool.
Yogi Bear, a brown bear commonly found in North America and Alaska.
Weighing up to 1800 pounds, brown bears are also the national animal of Finland.
I don't think you have to narrate.
But I liked where you were going with it, Boo Boo.
- l was hooked.
- Really?
Yes.
Now try to film from flattering angles, if you know what I mean.
Pic-a-nic baskets may be delicious on the lips, but they're a lifetime on the hips.
Oh, no.
Ranger Smith!
Ranger Smith.
The mayor's here.
What's he doing here?
Why didn't he give us more warning?
I have to secure the area.
All units, lock down the park.
Repeat, lock down the park.
Jones, you know I'm the only other ranger here, right?
Yeah.
- Ranger Smith, we need to talk.
- You could've just called.
BROWN:
Yeah, but I thought this would be more friendly.
I'm really working on my people skills.
Anyway, I am closing your park down.
- Okay.
- What?
Oh, yeah, this place just costs the city way too much money.
Jellystone hasn't made its operating budget in 10 years.
You know, it's hard to compete with all those amusement parks--
Oh, hey, you're not kidding.
Oh, have you guys been to Lincoln Log Land yet?
Oh, man, they have got a roller coaster there, it's made completely out of logs.
It's just like they rode in the pioneer days.
It's unbelievable.
Sir, Jellystone is special.
Okay?
It's turning 100 years old this very year.
Why, it's a landmark.
I would never let it be closed down.
Well, uh, you actually don't have a choice.
Have you read the city bylaws lately?
Chapter 6.
Section 73.
"Any municipal property that can't generate enough money to cover its operating budget can be rezoned for other uses."
And since Jellystone loses money every year, we're shutting it down.
Uh, sorry?
[BOTH CHUCKLE]
- l thought that went well.
CHIEF:
Yeah.
smith:
Just a second, Mr. Mayor.
Who says we can't cover our budget?
Park doesn't report earnings till next quarter.
Yeah, which is like one week away.
Come on, Smith.
You gotta be $20,000 in the hole.
We wish.
Yeah.
Try 30,562.
That's probably a couple hundred extra for the map stand.
I think it's confession time.
- l only pretended to fix it.
- Thanks, Jones.
Sounds like you're in pretty deep there, Smith.
Maybe we are.
But this is one of the last places families can go to be close to nature.
The world needs that.
Well, I'm not mayor of the world.
I'm mayor of this city.
And this city needs this park rezoned.
I'm sorry.
I feel awful about it.
Even though I look really good.
This is a new suit.
So, okay.
Maybe we don't have our operating budget today.
But you know what?
- A lot can happen in a week.
- All right.
Have it your way.
Take a week.
Hey, I'll even get you started.
What's the admission fee for one car again?
Four dollars.
Four dollars, huh?
Four whole dollars?
Well, that changes everything.
Oh, my goodness.
Well, I only need to come back in here like, uh, what, 10,000 more times?
[laughing]
In a week!
Do I have time for that?
- lmpossible.
- Oh, shoot.
[WEIRD AL yankovic'S "LASAGNA" playing ON STEREO]
You want-a some-a lasagna?
You hungry, buddy?
Of course!
I'm always hungry.
I was talking to my pet turtle.
Here you go.
That better not be my beefjerky.
[TURTLE chewing]
[BELCHES]
So, what's the big deal, Yogi?
This is the big deal, Boo Boo.
It's my masterpiece.
The Basket-Nabber 2000.
The most advanced pic-a-nic basket-stealing technology ever invented.
Wow.
Climb aboard.
This glider can steer dive, shoot rubber bands at pesky-type birds and even has an air bag.
Had an air bag.
Sorry, Yogi.
Not to worry.
We could cushion our landing with all the pic-a-nic baskets we swipe.
Now, how's that copilot seat feel?
A little wobbly, like it's not tied on very tight.
You won't feel that in the air.
Get ready to fly faster than the speed of sandwich, Boo Boo.
We're gonna break the pic-a-nic barrier.
smith:
Yogi!
- Uh-oh.
That's not his happy voice.
Don't move.
I'm switching the glider into stealth mode.
Stealth mode?
Wow.
How are you able to--?
Oh.
Ah, Mr. Ranger, sir.
Welcome.
Can I interest you in a sody pop?
- There you go.
- When did you steal our vending machine?
I, um-- l'm repairing it, sir.
This machine gives its sodas away for free when a bear kicks it.
Look, a camper has reported some missing fishing poles so I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say it was you.
Fishing poles?
Sir, I'm a bear.
If I wanted to catch fish, I would just use my....
Your paws, Yogi.
Isn't that kind of unsanitary?
What's that?
- What's what?
- That thing.
- What thing?
- The thing under the blanket.
- Blanket?
- The object right behind you.
Oh.
Oh, that.
Heh.
A sculpture.
I'm sculpting now.
Mostly landscapes.
And where's Boo Boo?
- France.
- What?
- That's not close by, is it?
- No.
Then he's in the bathroom.
- Excuse me.
- Wait!
[STAMMERlNG]
Hey, this isn't the bathroom.
I'm telling you, Mr. Ranger, it's not for stealing pic-a-nic baskets.
It says "Basket-Nabber 2000" right here, Yogi.
I do regret calling it that now.
I know I'm always saying, "Stay away from the campers."
This is different.
Jellystone is in real trouble.
If I don't raise $30,000 in a week, this park's getting rezoned.
Rezoned?
What does that mean?
It means the park won't be a park anymore.
The city will use this land for something else.
So we have got to do everything we can to help save it.
Which means you have gotta stop stealing food so that campers will leave here happy.
But they do leave here happy.
Getting your food stolen by Yogi Bear is special.
People come here for that.
It's like catching a foul ball at a baseball game.
Nope.
It's like getting your food stolen at a baseball game.
Come on, Yogi.
Would it really be so hard to be a regular bear?
You know, to forage for food, to walk around on all fours to hibernate a little, or a lot.
If nature had meant for me to be a regular bear it wouldn't have given me such a good thought-cooker, sir.
I can't help it if my melon is full of smart juice.
Yogi, your melon is hurting this park.
There are repercussions to stealing people's picnic baskets.
Not in my experience, sir.
[MECHANISM ticking]
[BELL RINGS]
[GRUNTS]
On the other hand--
[SCREAMS]
Ranger Smith, mind if I borrow the 'dilla?
It's an emergency.
Somebody parked without parking decals.
Jones, I would really prefer it if you focused on just maintaining the park instead.
Let me deal with the visitors until you've had more experience.
Sorry, sir.
Guess that's just the Eagle Scout in me, you know?
Always wanting to be in control, be a leader.
Live up to this fanny pack full of merit badges.
You know that fanny pack is for first aid supplies, right?
A merit badge in first aid is the only supply I need, sir.
Right, but it might not be the only supply a hurt person needs.
You seen Rachel?
Yeah, I saw her.
She was heading up to Lookout Mountain.
She can't be far. I'll drive.
Let's roll.
Jones.
The sprawling beauty of Jellystone Park.
A timeless stretch of wilderness untouched by man.
Oh.
Ranger Smith.
Wow, heh.
What's with the fancy outfit?
Dress greens.
I always wear dress greens in the evening.
You know, in case there's, you know- l don't know how to talk to girls.
- Oh.
Why do you think I spend so much time with animals?
All you have to do is scratch their backside and you've got a friend for life.
Try that with people and all of a sudden you're the weird girl on the bus that nobody wants to sit next to.
Um, uh, listen. I was wondering, you know, if you were--
I mean, it's getting late and we could, uh-- If you want.
I mean, it's not that-
- You don't-
- It's--
You know, it's not a worry.
Don't worry.
Did you just ask me to dinner?
Yes. I did.
Heh.
- Good, you got that, huh?
- Yes.
I just thought, well, it's getting late.
I happen to know this great place.
- Very gourmet.
- Really?
Where?
So close you won't believe it.
Wow, how did you ever find this place?
This is a four-star porch.
And fresh from the hot plate, I give you...
- ...rack of Spam.
- Oh.
Wow.
Maybe "gourmet" was a bit of a stretch.
No, it actually looks wonderful.
Great.
You know, this really is a peaceful place.
It's something, isn't it?
I pretty much grew up here.
My father was a ranger when I was a kid and he turned this park into the number one tourist destination in the state.
I mean, it was a park, you know?
Like families came by the hundreds swam in the streams, hiked on the trails.
It was really something.
This is really good.
Anyway, I don't know.
Maybe it's my fault.
I spent so many years learning everything I could about the park so I'd be a better ranger.
Maybe instead, I should have come up with a gimmick to get people to come here.
You know, change the name to Extreme Jellystone.
- l think that it's perfect just the way it is.
- You do?
You're right.
Absolutely.
There's no better place on earth.
YOGI:
Hey, Mr. Ranger.
- Except a place without him.
Evening, Mr. Ranger, sir.
Madame Moviemaker Lady.
And yes, I'm using the fancy tense to show you the utmost respect.
Hi.
Ha, ha.
What do you want, Yogi?
Well, I was thinking about the park's prickly predicament and I would like to do my part to help.
This is all the money I have saved.
Almost $100.
I was going to use it on myself, but I'd rather donate it to Jellystone.
Well, thank you, Yogi.
That's--
That is very sweet.
- Where does a bear get money from?
- That brown box by the parking lot.
The park donation box.
Yep.
But I want you to have it.
Consider it a gift to Jellystone.
That won't be hard.
Look, guys, I appreciate the effort.
But what this park needs is visitors and lots of them.
Well, I can help you there, sir.
Just make me a headliner.
I will rock this place.
- Kick it, Boo Boo.
- Kicking it.
[SIR MlX-A-LOT'S "BABY GOT BACK" playing]
I like big butts and I cannot lie You other brothers can't deny
That when a girl walks in With a itty-bitty waist
And a round thing in your face You get sprung
[music STOPS]
That's not gonna work either, Yogi.
You're right.
We need something flashier than music.
Not a problem.
I've got this water-skiing routine that will change the face of entertainment.
Got a little of everything.
Music, stunts, magic.
- And I jump over Boo Boo at the end.
- No, you don't.
- l want to try it.
- l don't care.
I hate to interrupt, but you're not gonna water-ski or dance or do anything that might disturb the campers, okay?
If what you really want to do is help save this park you will lay low, stay away from people.
Think you can do that for me?
You have my word, Mr. Ranger.
I will be seen, but not heard.
Or seen.
Fine.
Huh?
You guys done with that Spam?
- Get out of here.
- Okay.
Sheesh!
Hey.
What's this?
Seasons pass applications.
Unfortunately, not a lot of takers on those.
Fifty bucks for an entire year?
Including camping fees?
That's a bargain.
If this were a place people wanted to visit throughout the year.
Maybe Yogi was on to something.
- You said the park was turning 100, right?
- Right.
Well, a big event could really pull people in.
Yeah, you're right.
We could have, like, a moss collection day or a big squirrel chase.
- Or....
- Fireworks.
Yes.
Exactly.
Why didn't I think of that?
We could host a big centennial festival.
People always show up for fireworks.
If even half of the people buy season passes the park makes enough money to stay open.
Right.
Let's get the word out.
I think I can help with that.
[PEOPLE chattering INDISTINCTLY]
That is great.
How did we pay for it?
We didn't.
It was some fast-food restaurant but I rearranged the letters right before the plane took off.
[BOTH CHUCKLE]
You're very cool, Rachel Johnson.
You're pretty cool yourself.
I do have my own kind of natural swagger.
[SCREAMS]
Jellystone National Park, 1 00th year anniversary.
There'll be fireworks.
Just stay calm, Jones.
You should be patrolling in the Armadillo making park-impacting decisions, but--
- Hey, 1 00th year anniversary.
- Thanks.
But you're not there yet.
You still have to follow orders.
Even if those orders make you look like a giant Cheez-It.
Mr. Mayor!
Hi, Mr. Mayor.
Why is it only going halfway down again?
Doesn't make any-
- No!
Oh, okay. ls it a double tap or do I have to press it--?
- Oh, dang it!
- l got it, sir.
Yeah.
That's exactly what I did.
Let me see one of those fliers.
"Come celebrate Jellystone's 1 00th anniversary with fireworks and fun."
"And receive $10 off a season pass"?
He's gonna try to make the budget selling season passes.
[BOTH GROAN]
Yeah, ugh. lt's not a very good idea, in my opinion.
But nobody consulted me, because my job is just to maintain the park which is basically poking trash with a stick.
Yeah.
Yeah, why is a guy with your talent doing this insulting grunt work?
You should be running a park.
Yeah, but Ranger Smith says I have to pay my dues.
- Excuse me?
- What?
- He has to pay his dues?
Ha.
- Ha, ha.
Nobody pays dues anymore.
You gotta be in charge now while you still know everything.
- That's what I've been saying.
- Yeah.
Buddy, if it was up to me, you would be the head ranger of Jellystone already.
- You'd put me in charge?
- ln a second.
Yes.
You know, if this centennial festival didn't work out, I probably could relocate Smith.
You know, uh, maybe you could help me with that.
Make sure it doesn't succeed?
Wait, you mean, like, sabotage it?
No.
Oh, no, no, no.
No, I want you to be head ranger.
It just so happens that the only way to do that is to bring down this festival.
But spend the rest of your life as second-in-command if you like.
That's fine.
It's a perfectly valid life choice.
Well, you just think about it and give me a call, okay?
Here's my card.
So long.
Hey.
Now why is it doing that?
No.
Boy Scouts are loyal, thrifty, kind....
Hey, you're back.
Hey, thanks for getting those fliers out.
Let me tell you, this festival is gonna be huge.
Hey, Ranger Smith, how long do you think until I reach head ranger status?
Oh, no time at all.
I did it in 12 short years.
Ha, okay.
Are you serious?
Just be patient, Jones.
It'll be here before you know it.
This festival's gonna be great!
I can't wait 12 years.
[PEOPLE CHEERING AND LAUGHING]
Seasons pass order forms.
Seasons pass order forms.
Thank you.
Seasons pass order forms, $10 off today.
Ah, enjoy.
I can't take it, Boo Boo.
Two days without a tasty treat to eat?
And I have to sit up here while they're having a "happy birthday, Jellystone" party?
[sniffing]
And they have doughnuts.
Doughnuts!
BOO BOO [OVER radio]:
Yogi, what are you doing?
- Yogi!
- l'm going.
Hey.
Wait.
Don't do it, Yogi.
You promised Mr. Ranger.
You're right. I'm losing control, Boo Boo.
I don't know who's steering the ship.
Here.
I want you to handcuff me to this tree and not unlock it no matter what I say.
Okay, Yogi.
- Okay, unlock me.
- Huh?
It was a bad idea.
Unlock me.
[GRUNTlNG]
Unlock me!
[growling]
Okay.
Here you go.
JONES:
Folks, I hate to say this, but there are no spots left.
Forecast called for thunderstorms.
Severe lightning.
I fear for your young ones.
[CAR HORN honking]
We're out of fireworks, I'm afraid.
It's just sparklers left.
Oh, no.
You look nice.
Your napkin matches your tie.
I don't need you to kiss up to me.
Got this guy for that.
That's a good point, sir.
You were gonna handle this situation, yet there are quite a few people here.
Sir, I tried.
All last night I spent taking down fliers.
I blocked the entrance with a vehicle to back up traffic.
I hung up "rabid squirrel" signs everywhere.
Those were hand-drawn.
- Nothing is working.
- You need to think of something, don't you?
Or maybe you're just not head ranger material.
Mr. Mayor.
Mayor's yes man.
So glad you could join us.
I saved you a nice spot next to the porta-potties.
Oh, well, thank you.
Well, that's very thoughtful.
You know, I'm just so glad that these festivities are going so well, Smith.
I just hope nothing goes wrong.
[HORN honking]
We are gonna pull this off, Jonesy.
I've seen hundreds of people filling out seasons pass order forms.
The weather's great.
The fireworks, ready to go.
Even Yogi's staying out of the way.
Yogi.
[GROANING]
Hey, guys.
Sorry, just wandering around, bored out of my mind.
Bored?
But the 1 00th anniversary extravaganza's going on.
Yeah, more like 1 00th anniversary lame-aganza.
You know, because it's so lame.
People see fireworks every day in the city.
They thought they'd see something different here.
I knew it.
I should be out there doing my water-ski routine.
I'm a shining star and Ranger Smith is holding me back.
I don't know, Yogi.
Mr. Ranger is usually right about these things.
No, Boo Boo, Ranger Smith is in denial.
I mean, he's lost it, you know?
I saw him a couple days ago.
He was filling his pockets with dirt.
He said he's gonna start moving the park to his apartment piece by piece.
- How big is his apartment?
- There's still time.
I won't be able to do the half-hour artistic program but that was more for me anyway.
These people need the razzle-dazzle.
I don't think we've practiced the razzle-dazzle.
You're not supposed to, Boo Boo.
That's where it gets the razzle.
Yogi, I really don't think we should--
Boo Boo, you've tried to stop my brilliant ideas with common sense a thousand times.
Has it ever worked?
No.
Then let's go, go, go.
What does that taste like?
Unemployment?
- l'm sorry.
- Yeah.
Thanks again for helping with the fireworks.
I don't know where Jones disappeared to.
My pleasure.
You know, um, Rachel, I've been wanting to tell you...
- ...well, how much I--
- Ranger--
No, please, let me get through this.
I'm not very good with words.
But I have never felt so gushy.
Ha-ha-ha.
- You know?
- Ranger--
You know what I did?
I went and I wrote a song about you.
It's like this:
[humming]
Oh, no.
[singing] I saw you at the station
Had a heart palpitation
My sickness was love And you're the medication
Rachel
- Rachel
- The microphone is on.
smith:
And it comes around again
Rachel, Rachel, Rachel
The microphone is on.
Yes, the mic--
[CLEARS THROAT THEN LAUGHS]
Hi.
Hello and welcome to the 1 00th anniversary of Jellystone!
[cheering]
Thank you.
It is so wonderful to see so many people here today.
I've noticed many of you filling out your seasons pass order forms.
We're more than happy to collect those after the fireworks.
But first, please, sit back, get comfortable and enjoy the show!
- Terrific.
- Mr. Mayor?
[POISON'S "nothin' BUT A GOOD time" playing ON STEREO]
That's not the right music.
I'll take it from here, Mr. Ranger!
Oh, no.
Full speed ahead, Boo Boo.
Okay.
Not bad, eh, Boo Boo?
Looking good, Yogi.
- This cannot be happening.
- Oh, it's happening.
[YOGI STAMMERING]
Hello, Jellystone!
[CROWD CHEERING]
No, don't encourage him!
They love me. I can do no wrong.
Watch this.
All right, Boo Boo!
Turn up the heat!
Phase two, go.
I'm an unstoppable water-skiing machine.
[laughing]
Ta-da!
Oh, wait.
There's more.
How about if I heat things up?
[smith WHlMPERS]
[GROANING]
Don't need nothin' but a good time
And it don't get better than this
Yogi!
Yogi, your cape.
I know.
It is magnificent.
And on fire.
Huh?
Fire!
[GROANING]
- Turn the boat!
- Huh?
- Turn, Boo Boo!
- Hang on, Yogi!
Too much razzle!
[CROWD screaming]
[GASPS]
- Nice one.
- Thanks.
[RACHEL GASPS]
Jump!
[chuckling]
[cheering]
[ALL GASP]
[MURMURlNG]
Let's go.
[screaming AND SHOUTING]
MAN:
Out of my way!
[chuckling]
This could not have gone more perfectly.
Hey, you got a little, uh....
Never mind.
Let's go.
[SIGHS]
[WOOD snapping AND CREAKING]
Mr. Ranger, I thought--
Yogi, that's the problem.
All the thinking.
Hey, you know what would be great?
If you didn't think.
If you could just be a regular bear.
You know, sitting in the woods, minding his own business.
But no, you're different.
You're smart.
And you'd rather spend your days being selfish and destructive while everyone else pays the price.
But I guess it wasn't enough, screwing up my life.
No, this time you had to go and bring down this entire park.
So tell me, Yogi how smart are you now?
Hey, there!
That was quite a show you put on yesterday.
Ha-ha-ha.
I can't wait to see what you do with this.
That's your new assignment.
Evergreen Park.
Oh, I think you're just going to find it delightful.
Oh, and, uh, Ranger Jones is gonna be taking over here.
Ranger Jones?
Well, I have got a press conference to plan.
You see, it turns out I've saved the city.
Don't forget to vote, my friend.
Brown for governor!
Ha-ha-ha.
He's not gonna vote for me, is he?
Uh, no.
You did everything you could.
Doesn't matter.
This park needed a ranger who could make it popular again.
I'm just some guy who knows how old every tree is.
Fat lot of good that did Jellystone.
Face it.
You and I are just two people who care about things that nobody else does and that's why we're alone.
Or maybe that's why we found each other.
Did you ever think of that?
Rachel, you and this park have one thing in common.
You both deserve a better man than me.
I can't believe he's really gone.
Yogi, are you okay?
I'm done being special, Boo Boo.
Ranger Smith was right.
My whole life, I've been different.
But it's done nothing but hurt people.
The world would be better off if I was only as smart as the average bear.
Yogi, what are you doing?
I'm leaving, Boo Boo.
- l am going to forage for food in the wild.
- Huh?
Might even catch some fish.
With my paws.
[SIGHS]
I'm just gonna grab a little something for the road.
Some chips and soda.
And this.
Peach pie.
Any more of that casserole?
Top shelf.
I'll be out there.
Fending for myself.
Foraging for food in the wild.
[METAL CLANKING]
Goodbye, horsepower limiter.
There's a new head ranger in town.
Let's see what you got.
[GRUNTlNG]
Perfect.
[sobbing]
I'm sorry, Ranger Smith.
No more food.
No more pic-a-nickers.
How could this get any worse?
[THUNDER booming]
Oh.
Ah, Evergreen Park.
Yes, it is simply delightful.
[giggling]
- Come on.
- l've got it, sir.
This is unbelievable.
Ah, Evergreen Park.
Lovely, isn't it?
This isn't a park.
I can barely breathe in here.
Look at these trees.
They're all plastic.
Oh, no, they're real.
It's just years of smog and pollution have left a plastic-like coating on them.
Think people will be happy you're closing the most beautiful park in the state?
Well, they will be when they find out it's making the city rich and giving each citizen a check for $1000.
How is that even possible?
Oh, well, it turns out that there has been some agricultural interest in the park.
And it's a lot more profitable than people in station wagons making s'mores.
[laughing]
Have a good day, Ranger Smith.
I hate this car. I hate it.
[GRUNTS]
[CHAINSAWS buzzing]
Yeah!
Oh, hey, there he is.
Ha-ha-ha.
Whoa, hey, Mr. Mayor!
I, uh....
Just finishing some stamping.
You are doing great, Jones.
I knew you were the guy for this job.
Quick thing.
You'll probably notice some giant trucks rumbling by.
We're just clearing a little patch of trees for my press conference.
No big deal.
Um, wait, you're cutting down trees?
Oh, yeah.
Well, just a few.
It's nothing to worry about.
Actually gonna improve the park quite a bit.
I'll bet one of the first things you noticed as head ranger is that you need more clear spaces here, and you are absolutely right.
Now you can host concerts and Boy Scout jamborees.
That's a pretty smart move there, Head Ranger Jones.
I have some other park improvements I want to run by you.
Oh, splendid, yes.
I think I have a few moments to hear those.
Look into the security arrangements for tomorrow.
I don't want any surprises.
I'll hear what Ding-Dong has to say.
What do you got?
I'm hungrier than the average bear.
I wish I could find a bush that tasted like birthday cake.
Gotcha.
[GROANS]
Pretend it's a gummy worm.
Pretend it's a gummy worm.
[GASPS]
Yogi, I've been looking everywhere for you.
Not now, Boo Boo.
I'm busy foraging.
[GROANS]
[SHOUTS]
Come on, Yogi.
Jellystone is in trouble.
We need your help.
Nothing I can do, Boo Boo.
I'm average now.
My brain is out of business.
I wouldn't even be standing if my paws didn't hurt.
Quit feeling sorry for yourself.
You know you're not an average bear.
Hey, hey, Boo Boo.
You're right, I'm not.
I failed at that too.
Hey, come back here.
You've gotta save Jellystone.
YOGI:
What are you doing?
I'm not--
Yogi, you have to use your smarts for good.
And if you can't see that, maybe you are just an average bear.
Come on.
[GRUNTlNG]
Now do you understand?
What's going on, Boo Boo?
I don't know.
But whatever it is I think they're just getting started.
Boo Boo get my collar.
Nobody is gonna hurt Jellystone.
Where are we going, Yogi?
We can't get Jellystone back alone, Boo Boo.
My thinker is good, but Ranger Smith's is better.
He was going to a place called Evergreen Park.
That's right. ln the city.
The city?
That's a long walk.
Don't be silly, Boo Boo.
I've already got a smarty-smart cheat to keep our feet off the street.
Get ready for it.
Here it comes.
Run, Boo Boo, run!
Hurry, Boo Boo.
I think we gotta jump for it.
Ready?
All aboard.
Good.
Yogi, grab my paw.
[GROANING]
[GRUNTlNG]
Sorry.
[YOGI shouting]
Boo Boo, Boo Boo, Boo Boo!
I gotta get--!
I guess it makes a stop here.
Yup.
Looks like Evergreen Park is about two miles away from here.
Two miles?
I'll have to tap into my emergency rations.
Snack break.
Come on, Yogi.
We need to keep moving.
It's not that far and it's all downhill.
Downhill?
Excuse me, Mr. Dirty Shopper.
Any chance my friend and I might borrow your wheely-basket?
Is that chocolate?
[YOGI AND BOO BOO laughing]
Okay, Boo Boo, keep it steady.
I'm okay, Ma.
Just--
Yeah, no, it's not Jellystone, but at least there's nothing here to drive me crazy.
- Hey, Mr. Ranger.
- Hey, Yogi.
[CART CRASHES]
All right, Ma, I gotta call you back.
What are you guys doing here?
We need your help, Mr. Ranger, sir.
But don't worry, my days of goofing things up for you are over.
MAN:
Hey, move that shopping cart!
[SHOUTING]
I'm okay!
I'm just gonna put this over here.
What do you want?
I don't have a life left for you to ruin anymore.
Sir, I know I messed things up and I'm sorry.
I never meant to.
You and Boo Boo are the best friends I ever had.
And I've never done anything but think of myself.
And now Jellystone is just gonna be a big field of stumps.
What?
They've started cutting down the trees.
"Agricultural interest" is logging.
Oh, no, not our Jellystone.
We have to save it, sir.
I don't think we can save it, Yogi.
I'm no smarter than you.
I lost Jellystone.
I lost Rachel.
It's over.
Mr. Ranger, I've learned two things from stealing pic-a-nic baskets.
One:
light mayonnaise is not nearly as good as regular mayonnaise.
And two: you can't fail if you never stop trying.
You have to fight for the things you love whether it's a park, a girl or a roast beef sandwich.
Don't give up now.
We're all Jellystone's got.
You're right, Yogi.
Jellystone's too important to give up on.
We gotta try.
Come on.
- Shotgun.
- Aw.
I never thought I'd see this.
Happy 1 00th anniversary, Jellystone.
Isn't that Miss Movie Lady?
RACHEL:
I gotta get in there.
You don't understand.
Let me in, please.
No can do.
Park is closed to the public until the press conference.
Mayor's orders.
Then go talk to him.
Tell him what I told you.
I'm sorry.
I don't really take orders from a--
I lived with gorillas, pal.
I know rage.
You do not want me to go gorilla on you.
[SCREAMS]
Uh, I'll speak to the mayor.
- Thank you.
- Okay.
Rachel.
Ranger Smith.
I didn't think I'd ever see you again.
I know.
I don't know what I was thinking.
I think you're perfect.
I think any guy in the world would be lucky just to stand next to you.
You really mean that?
Of course I do.
It's just, when I lost Jellystone, I felt like such a failure.
But losing you has felt much, much worse.
I'm like....
I'm like a genus without a phylum.
That's the sweetest thing anyone's ever said to me.
- So, um, we're still here.
YOGI:
Mm-hm.
Oh, right.
Ahem.
So, what are you doing here?
- Come on, I'll show you.
- Okay.
I was reviewing the documentary footage from Boo Boo's camera and I saw this.
Oh, my.
I see it.
I have a bald spot back there!
I'm not talking about you, Yogi.
I'm talking about this.
Yeah, it's my pet turtle.
He hangs out at the cave all the time.
True.
You know they don't come out of that shell?
I tried one time to see what one would look like without it.
But, nope, they're sewn in.
This is no regular turtle.
See the bulging frog-like eyes and the really wide mouth?
A frog-mouthed turtle?
Yup, Rafetus swinhoei.
smith:
But those are extinct.
For a hundred years, but apparently one still exists.
And he lives in there.
But they won't let me through the gates to go find him.
But if Jellystone has an endangered species living in it, then--
It has to be protected as a park.
That's the law.
That turtle can save this park.
Now I feel kinda bad about using him as a foot stool.
CHIEF:
You've seen the filmmaker?
Well, we spoke.
About extinct turtles.
You're telling me there is an extinct turtle living here in the park?
According to Miss Johnson's film, there is.
An extinct turtle?
That's great.
Visitors will come from miles around to see an endangered species.
Yes, they will, and that is great.
We need to find this turtle.
Just to keep it safe.
Have a vet check it out.
The whole deal.
The sooner we get to him the better.
Oh, we need a head ranger who's good enough to find it.
Someone who thinks like a turtle.
I am that head ranger.
Well, then why are you still here?
He's back.
Come on.
You need to let us in this park.
That turtle needs protection.
Don't worry about the turtle.
We're handling it.
We'll make sure he's put in a nice zoo.
No.
A turtle that's endangered can't be removed from its natural habitat.
It's against federal law.
It is?
Wow, I've never heard of that law in chapter 4, subsection 6 of the Wildlife Protection Mandate.
Don't worry, Mr. Ranger, sir.
That turtle is safe.
These people have no idea where my cave is.
The turtle's in the talking bear's cave.
JONES [OVER radio]:
Copy.
Wow, that backfired.
Okay.
You know what?
Fine,
You win.
What are you doing?
I have a plan.
One of the advantages of having lived here since I was a kid is I know this park like the back of my hand.
Let's go!
Hold on, boys.
All right.
Hey, there, little buddy.
Hello, there.
Uh-oh.
Sorry about that.
- Mayor Brown.
- This had better be good, Jones.
JONES:
I found the turtle.
He was in Boo Boo's sleeping bag.
But now I have him secure at the picnic area.
Jones, you're a hero.
Sit tight.
My chief of staff is on his way to get him.
Copy that.
Head Ranger Jones over and out.
smith:
He found the turtle.
Dang it.
Can't cross those rapids.
There's no way to get to him from here.
Well, there is one way.
There it is.
My masterpiece.
- You really think you can pull this off?
- l know I can, sir.
I'm gonna snatch that basket-type turtle box and fly away like a fuzzy bird.
And I've got the best copilot a basket-snatching machine could have.
- l don't know how to fly this thing.
- Well, you'll pick it up as we go.
smith:
Okay.
Look, just be careful, okay, Yogi?
Copy that, ground control.
Basket-Nabber 2000 ready for takeoff.
- Flight systems check.
Boo Boo?
- What?
- Can you reach the pedals?
- lf I point my toes.
Flight systems are go.
Remember what I told you about flying gliders, Yogi.
Don't fight the wind.
As long as the wind wants me to snatch up that turtle, we'll get along just fine.
- All right.
YOGI:
Start pedaling, Boo Boo.
All right.
Here goes.
YOGI:
Hold on, Boo Boo.
Fasten your seat belt.
But there isn't one.
YOGI:
Here we go!
BOO BOO:
Oh, Yogi!
The wind should carry you south!
We'll meet you there!
Take your time, Mr. Ranger.
This machine is equipped with landing gear.
We'll touch down as soft as a feather.
Whoops.
This is your captain speaking.
We'll reach our turtle target in about two minutes.
So let's go ahead and start the beverage service.
- Yogi, look out.
- Aah!
- Trees!
- Yes, trees!
[BOTH SCREAMING]
I got it.
I got it.
I got it.
I don't got it!
BOO BOO:
Pull up.
- Hey!
- Pull up!
You did it, Yogi.
Oh.
Yeah.
Ha-ha-ha.
Great job, Jones.
I'll get this guy to the city zoo.
- The city zoo?
- Yep.
They got a nice spot ready in the reptile house.
The city zoo doesn't have a reptile house.
They're building one.
- Who is?
- Builders.
Sure you're trying to protect the turtle?
Yeah, we love turtles.
Then you won't mind if I hold onto him until I notify the Wildlife Federation, right?
All right.
You're gonna find this out in a few hours anyway, so I might as well tell you.
We gotta lose this turtle to sell logging rights to the park.
Logging?
The whole park?
Yeah, but who cares?
It's still a park, just without trees.
And they'll grow back.
Yeah, in like 200 years.
It doesn't matter.
Your career is what matters.
Ha-ha-ha.
Turtle target acquired.
I need 20 more feet of altitude.
Engage the hand pedals.
You couldn't put the hand pedals by you?
There's a suggestion box behind the seat, Boo Boo.
[GROANS]
Wait, you don't want to approach him like that.
He's poisonous.
He's in a basket.
But he can spit.
Poison.
He'll aim at your eyes.
Melt them out of your head.
- l'm telling you, that turtle is deadly.
- What are you looking at?
- Hook me in, Boo Boo.
- Okay.
And fire!
Here you go.
Huh?
Yogi, wait!
Here I come!
He's going for the turtle.
- Mind if I borrow this?
- Hey!
[YOGI LAUGHS]
Look, Boo Boo!
We got the turtle!
Hey, why aren't you in your seat?
That bear knows how to steal a basket.
Everybody after that glider now!
I'm not gonna let a bear make me look bad.
Been there, buddy.
We're drifting too far right.
I wanna get us outside the park.
Don't fight the wind, Yogi.
Remember what Miss Movie Lady said about--
Never mind.
YOGI:
Hang on, Boo Boo.
- What do we do now?
Did you check the safety manual?
It's just a picture of us screaming.
[BOTH SCREAMING]
We've got to deject, Boo.
Don't you mean eject?
Eject is up.
Deject is down.
In case of emergency your seat can also be used as a flotation device!
[YOGI laughing]
[GRUNTlNG]
Hey, told you.
Nothing to worry about.
I actually think I wasn't worried enough.
Let me see how our little passenger is doing.
Wonder why they call him a frog-mouthed turtle anyway?
Hey!
smith:
Hey, guys, over here!
Yogi, grab the branch.
Got you, Mr. Ranger, sir.
[smith AND RACHEL GRUNT]
- Welcome aboard.
smith:
Yogi.
We were trying to get you off the raft.
Yeah, that makes more sense.
You guys did it.
You saved him.
[CAR HORN HONKS]
Oh, no.
They're gonna catch us downstream.
I'm on it.
No, Yogi, don't.
Problem solved.
They can't catch us now.
Yeah, because now we are headed straight for the Jellyjarring Rapids.
[GRUNTS]
- Grab a paddle.
- Tuck your head in, little buddy.
Brace yourselves.
Oh, come on, turtle.
Don't worry, I put safety belts in this raft for just such an occasion.
You better hang on.
Mr. Ranger said--
YOGI:
We're gonna be fine, Boo Boo.
Just sit back and let Mother Nature carry us to--
[ALL SCREAMING]
I think Mother Nature's kind of cranky today.
You okay, Yogi?
Fine!
Turtle!
YOGI:
Who's that?
I can't see.
Come here, turtle.
- Got him.
smith:
Good work, Boo Boo.
We made it through the rapids.
Yeah, but that means the falls are just up ahead.
Hold on!
[screaming]
Yogi.
Yogi.
Now who says there are no rides at Jellystone?
Yeah, you've definitely got the thrill part down.
ANNOUNCER:
Please, take your seats.
The press conference is about to begin.
That's over a mile away.
We're never gonna make that in time.
[ALL GASP]
- Ranger Jones?
- l messed up pretty bad, sir.
- l know. lt's okay.
- l wanted to be head ranger.
Because you're a good head ranger and I value leadership.
I have a merit badge--
Can we talk later?
We're pressed for time.
Yes.
Get in.
[SIREN wailing]
YOGI:
Boo Boo!
Boo Boo!
Wait up!
smith:
Well, well.
Guess who we found.
Starts with T and ends with a-- "Urtle"?
It's over.
Call off the logging.
The law says this park is now a protected nature preserve.
You think I care about what the law says?
Or about some endangered "frog-mouthed turtle"?
Or some stupid park for families to have a picnic in?
I care about power, you pinheads!
And I'm gonna get it.
Nobody knows this turtle exists.
And nobody ever will.
You found the turtle.
Get this thing out of here before anybody else sees it.
- Rachel!
- Oh!
Yogi!
BOO BOO:
Yogi, here!
Thank you.
- Yogi.
- l'm sorry.
He was open.
Ha, ha.
Now if you'll excuse me, I have a press conference.
I can still tell them what you did.
Oh, yeah?
Without that turtle or a scrap of evidence, go right ahead.
Well, you might as well tell them Bigfoot is here.
Ha-ha-ha.
And do yourself a favor, there, ranger.
Try to keep your dignity.
It's all you have left.
You know what?
I'm taking care of this thing myself this time.
That's the only way to make sure the job is done right.
But that's why I'm the mayor's right-hand man, right?
Because I don't make mistakes.
Hey, you know, people are wondering:
"Why should I vote for Mayor Brown to be governor?"
Well, how about this:
Mayor Brown just turned the city's budget from a deficit into a surplus!
And put $1000 into the pocket of every citizen of this city!
Now before I sign the paperwork that will save the city why don't you all take a look at my first campaign ad for governor?
ANNOUNCER:
Mayor Brown, the right choice for governor.
We're out of time.
Must be something we can do.
Anybody have any ideas?
Well, I guess this is going to be a pretty sad documentary, huh?
Are you--?
is he still filming?
I needed more footage, so I told him to keep it rolling.
I can plug that into the video feed right up there.
I just need a way to distract the guards.
I think we can take care of that.
ANNOUNCER:
He supports public safety.
[JOURNEY'S "DON'T STOP believing" playing ON TV]
All right, hurry up, people.
Focus.
Let's go save those orphans.
YOGI:
Hey, hey, hey, check this out!
- Kick it, Boo Boo.
- Kicking it.
Don't stop believing
[laughing]
Hold on to that feeling
ANNOUNCER:
He's tough on crime.
[SHOUTS]
Hey, hey, hey, look at this.
Keep your eye on the little bear.
Look at the skills.
Amazing!
[GRUNTlNG]
ANNOUNCER:
And here's what Mayor Brown proudly has to say about protecting our natural resources.
[music STOPS]
You think I care about what the law says?
Or about some endangered "frog-mouthed turtle"?
- Some stupid park for families to picnic in?
- No.
No.
No. I care about power, you pinheads!
Oh, boy.
Nobody knows this turtle exists.
And nobody ever will.
[BOOING AND jeering]
[laughing]
There's about to be a riot out there.
I need you out front.
[GRUNTS]
Okay.
No.
Hey, wait.
Wait, wait, wait.
Please, please, please.
That was not real.
Trust me, there is no such thing as a frog-mouthed turtle.
He's right next to me, isn't he?
Okay.
- We did it, Yogi!
- Up high, Boo Boo!
- All right!
JONES:
We got it!
Yogi!
All right, and now....
Miss Moviemaker Lady.
smith:
Hey, we did it.
[laughing]
Hey, Mr. Ranger!
RACHEL:
Come on, Boo Boo.
- Okay.
I was wrong, Yogi.
I say from here on, we just be proud of who we are and fight for the things we're passionate about, like this park.
And Rachel.
And pic-a-nic baskets?
And pic-a-nic baskets.
- Aw, come here!
- No, you don't have to--
Okay.
All right, that's--
I'm good.
[CROWD chattering]
RACHEL:
Here you go, Boo Boo.
Take good care of him.
Hey, there, buddy.
No, no, no, I never took a kickback on anything in my entire career.
No one loves turtles more than I do.
And nature in general. I love trees.
Oh, no, you don't!
[GROWLS]
Gorilla?
Himalayan snow leopard.
Huh.
Welcome to Jellystone, home of the frog-mouthed turtle.
And brochures.
I'm Ranger Jones.
NARRATOR:
Ah, yes, Jellystone Park.
A wonderful little piece of paradise.
Where families come and soak up the tranquility of nature.
It's a place that--
[machine WHIRRING]
Huh?
Never mind.
MAN:
Hey, hey, hey!
[chattering lNDlSTlNCTLY]
Hi.
Welcome.
Well, I am certainly glad that you are gonna be staying in Jellystone for a while.
And what animal will you be observing?
Well, I thought I would observe the courting rituals of the American ranger.
I happen to hear the American ranger is a very charming intelligent, attractive species.
One that always keeps his cool.
Even when basket-stealing bears push his buttons?
Listen, Yogi will be Yogi.
And I'm just not gonna let it bother me anymore.
Besides I have more important things to focus on.
Oh....
[laughing]
I....
Let's-
- Let's try that again.
[HORN honking]
[gasping]
Afternoon, Mr. Ranger, sir!
Hi, Miss Movie Lady!
[BARKING]
Yogi!
I love this place.
smith:
Yogi!
Hey!
[English
- US
- SDH]
NARRATOR:
Jellystone Park.
One of the nation's oldest and most beautiful stretches of wilderness.
For years, families have headed out from the busy city eager to enjoy a little camping, fishing and, of course, observing the park's natural wildlife.
Boo Boo, I think it's time I introduced myself to that pic-a-nic basket.
You know, Yogi, we could just hunt for food.
AII the other animals do.
Boo Boo, a pic-a-nic basket has everything a bear needs.
And I'm not just talking about the treats and snack-type goodies.
No.
A pic-a-nic basket holds a Iot more than that.
It holds dreams.
[WHISPERING] What are we looking at?
I don't know.
Hook me in.
[IN NORMAL VOICE] You sure it'II work, Yogi?
well, you know, Boo Boo, I'm smarter than the average bear!
[SHOUTING]
[CHUCKLING]
AII right!
[GASPS]
[SHOUTING]
[GRUNTS]
[CHUCKLING]
[GROANS]
MAN:
Ranger Smith!
Sorry about that.
We got a 4-23 in Redwood valley, sir.
-A what?
-A bear disturbance.
-I think it's probabIy--
-I know who it is.
Why didn't you just say "bear disturbance"?
well, I....
Uh, well, it sounds cooler.
I mean, we're park rangers, sir.
You know:
"To protect and preserve."
Did you just make that motto up?
Yeah, I did.
Do you Iike it?
Ranger Jones, you know that, well, being a park ranger, it's not about mottos.
It's about keeping the park safe.
That's where the glory is.
Protecting all of this.
Yeah, I know.
Besides, that motto was still in the testing phase.
It's not Iike I made T-shirts or anything.
Heh, no, of course not.
Okay, I'm gonna deal with that 4-23.
Okay, copy that, sir.
Um, I'm actually gonna hop in the armadillo, make some rounds.
Jones, you know that the armadillo is for head ranger use only.
I might need it at any moment to deal with a park emergency.
Why don't you finish stacking those trail maps?
Yeah, sure.
Okay.
Yeah, because that's what future head rangers do, they stack maps.
Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy!
Our days of getting banged up to grab a meal are over, Boo Boo.
From now on, the pic-a-nic baskets are going to fall into our arms.
soldering iron.
BOO BOO:
Here you go.
-Thank you.
Okay.
That should do it.
Test rock.
Okay, Yogi.
YOGI:
Weight sensor triggered.
Basket in position.
Launch spring starts coiIing.
Firing pin drops.
And....
[BELL RINGS]
bull's-eye!
I'm so smart it hurts!
You're standing on the soldering iron.
Or it's that.
[SHOUTING]
Hot, hot, hot!
There's the test rock.
Now we just wait here for a pic-a-nic basket to fall into our arms.
Are you sure about this, Yogi?
people seem to get pretty mad when you--
A genius never questions his instincts, Boo Boo.
When you have a mind like mine you can't blink or you'II put a kink in your think.
Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.
We've got our first customers.
And they have pie!
I wonder what kind it is.
SMITH:
Yogi, are you out here?
-It's Mr. Ranger.
-Aah!
Get rid of the test rock.
Destroy the evidence.
I was never here.
SMITH:
Look-
- Ow!
hello, Mr. Ranger, sir.
Did you just--?
Did you guys--?
Did you--?
Oh, never mind.
Look, there was a complaint about a bear interfering with a family picnic.
I see.
And you'd Iike us to mount some sort of investigation?
No, I think it was you.
What?
!
How can you even think that?
Are you feverish?
Let me press my lips against your forehead.
Wait!
You're not pressing your lips against my forehead.
Hey, it's a Iot better than the way they take my temperature.
[CHUCKLES]
No, look, Yogi, we've been over this many times.
Bears are supposed to avoid people, not run around stealing their food.
I agree, sir.
That's why my friend Boo Boo and I would never think of disturbing a family's pic-a-nic.
[BELL RINGS AND WOOD CLUNKS]
[WOMAN SCREAMS]
Huh.
It missed.
[GROANS]
Good day, Mr. Ranger, sir.
We'II keep our eyes peeled.
I wonder if he noticed the pie.
JONES [CHOPPY OVER RADIO]:
Ra-
- Smith.
You have a vis-
- Over.
Didn't understand a word of that, Jones.
-Sorry.
Some lady's here to see you.
-Send her in.
-Okay.
I'II be in the armadillo.
-Or you could be....
-Map stacking?
-Map stacking.
-Ranger Smith?
-Yes.
-hello.
I'm rachel Johnson.
-Hi.
I was hoping to talk to you about filming a documentary here.
Sure.
I can handle you for that.
handle that for you.
Sorry.
My work isn't-- My brain isn't working right.
-I must have inhaled some jimsonweed.
-Oh.
Datura stramonium.
It's known to cause delirium...
-...cramping and nausea.
Heh.
-Cramping and nausea.
You've read The North American Wilderness Guide.
Yeah, I Iike to highlight all the plants and animals I see.
-I Iike to-
- Me too.
-Ha, ha!
Yeah.
[SMITH STAMMERING]
Ranger Smith.
At your service.
You want to film a documentary in JeIIystone?
Yes.
I sent you a letter about a month ago.
-Written on a piece of bark.
-That was you!
Yes.
I'm sorry about that.
I was in Sumatra, living among the orangutans at the time and they get very nervous if they spot anything from the modern world.
really?
Wow, that's amazing.
Then what did you use for ink?
Bird poop and spit.
Impressive.
So, what are you here to film?
well, I was hoping to shoot a local species.
Something to really capture the beauty of a national park.
Terrific.
What animal were you thinking?
I heard you had an unusual brown bear.
-Brown bear?
-Yes.
One that talks?
Those are so rare.
-None that I can think of.
-Named Yogi?
Wears a hat and a tie?
No, that doesn't ring a bell.
I think he's standing on the roof, trying to steal your lunchbox.
YOGI:
I smell PB and J.
[YOGI SHOUTING]
I'm all done.
Oh, right.
That Yogi.
Bankrupt?
No, no, no.
We're a city.
Cities don't go bankrupt.
They do when they're broke, sir.
We just have to find some money somewhere.
I'm about to run for governor.
How am I gonna do that when my own city is bankrupt?
Okay, yes.
Thank you.
-Here's the invoice, Mr. Mayor.
-Yikes!
Wow.
Ha.
I'm gonna pretend I didn't see that.
Just bill it to the city, okay?
Thank you.
Ugh.
How did we ever go so broke?
-I think we just spent too much.
-Hmm.
Is there anything we can sell?
You already sold the public golf course to condo developers two of the three fire stations to that frozen yogurt company.
You were selling the library, but it burned down.
Oh, yeah.
That was gonna be one of those make-your-own-doughnut places.
-No.
-Yeah.
-If you could dream it up, you could make it.
-Ah.
Love those.
We gotta think of something here.
well, if we don't have anything to sell, maybe we can profit off what we can't sell.
I don't understand those words.
Like when we sold the bottling rights to the water in Lake BeucIair.
-We made a fortune.
-Yeah.
SinkhoIe BeucIair is a great place to throw old mattresses.
-Oh, yeah.
-Hmm.
We just don't have any more resources to exploit.
Or do we?
JeIIystone.
If we rezone JeIIystone Park as agricultural land, we can sell the logging rights.
Here.
This company says they'II give us thousands of dollars an acre just to cut down the trees or something.
That'II be enough to balance the budget and give each citizen a big fat check.
[LAUGHING]
You have any idea how many votes that'II buy me?
-Enough to be the next governor?
-exactly.
You're fine, Yogi.
It's just a few scrapes and bruises.
I don't know, Mr. Ranger.
I'm pretty sure I heard my spine snap.
well, you wouldn't be able to stand.
And you wouldn't be able to eat.
I'm okay!
Yogi, Boo Boo, I would Iike to introduce you to rachel Johnson who's here to make a nature documentary.
[GROWLS]
What the heck was that?
I was saying hello.
I lived in a den with brown bears for six months.
only bear I've ever lived with is Boo Boo.
And he only makes that sound after he's eaten baked beans.
Heh, heh.
I have problems with baked beans.
And for a little bear, he makes a Iot of stink.
Okay, I have some fantastic river otters you can film instead.
-could get a hat and tie on the slow one.
-No, you know, I really, really like these two.
-would you guys mind if I shoot you?
YOGI:
Huh?
[RAPID FOOTSTEPS]
Yogi, I think she meant with a camera.
Yes.
Of course with a camera.
Heh-heh-heh.
I knew that.
But not just any camera.
This isn't gonna make me look fat, is it?
RACHEL:
No, you are gonna look great.
Okay, just a few more adjustments.
[WHISPERING] please, excuse the pre-tied bow tie.
My mornings are often rushed.
It's fine, Boo Boo.
This is going to be a whole new perspective for a documentary.
The Boo Boo cam will capture the true wilderness in all its natural glory.
No other human in sight.
That sounds like my apartment.
Ha, ha.
Uh, you know, because I Iive alone.
well, plenty of women have tried to change that.
It's just, I haven't found one that--
-Likes you?
-What?
No.
No, that--
will return your calls?
Can you stop helping, please?
Sir, I can see you Iike this lady.
But your courting rituals need work.
What you need to do is follow her around for two days making snorting sounds.
Then fight any male that looks at her.
And then, of course, urinate on her to mark her as your territory.
Works every time.
I got it under control, Yogi.
-Boo Boo, you're rolling.
-cool.
Yogi Bear, a brown bear commonly found in North America and alaska.
Weighing up to 1800 pounds, brown bears are also the national animal of finland.
I don't think you have to narrate.
But I liked where you were going with it, Boo Boo.
-I was hooked.
-really?
Yes.
Now try to film from flattering angles, if you know what I mean.
Pic-a-nic baskets may be delicious on the lips, but they're a lifetime on the hips.
Oh, no.
Ranger Smith!
Ranger Smith.
The mayor's here.
What's he doing here?
Why didn't he give us more warning?
I have to secure the area.
AII units, lock down the park.
Repeat, lock down the park.
Jones, you know I'm the only other ranger here, right?
Yeah.
-Ranger Smith, we need to talk.
-You could've just called.
BROWN:
Yeah, but I thought this would be more friendly.
I'm really working on my people skills.
Anyway, I am closing your park down.
-Okay.
-What?
Oh, yeah, this place just costs the city way too much money.
JeIIystone hasn't made its operating budget in 10 years.
You know, it's hard to compete with all those amusement parks--
Oh, hey, you're not kidding.
Oh, have you guys been to lincoln Log Land yet?
Oh, man, they have got a roller coaster there, it's made completely out of logs.
It's just like they rode in the pioneer days.
It's unbelievable.
Sir, JeIIystone is special.
Okay?
It's turning 100 years old this very year.
Why, it's a landmark.
I would never let it be closed down.
well, uh, you actually don't have a choice.
Have you read the city bylaws lately?
Chapter 6.
Section 73.
"Any municipal property that can't generate enough money to cover its operating budget can be rezoned for other uses."
And since JeIIystone loses money every year, we're shutting it down.
Uh, sorry?
[BOTH CHUCKLE]
-I thought that went well.
CHIEF:
Yeah.
SMITH:
Just a second, Mr. Mayor.
Who says we can't cover our budget?
Park doesn't report earnings till next quarter.
Yeah, which is like one week away.
Come on, Smith.
You gotta be $20,000 in the hole.
We wish.
Yeah.
Try 30,562.
That's probably a couple hundred extra for the map stand.
I think it's confession time.
-I only pretended to fix it.
-Thanks, Jones.
Sounds like you're in pretty deep there, Smith.
Maybe we are.
But this is one of the Iast places families can go to be close to nature.
The world needs that.
well, I'm not mayor of the world.
I'm mayor of this city.
And this city needs this park rezoned.
I'm sorry.
I feel awful about it.
Even though I Iook really good.
This is a new suit.
So, okay.
Maybe we don't have our operating budget today.
But you know what?
-A Iot can happen in a week.
-AII right.
Have it your way.
Take a week.
Hey, I'II even get you started.
What's the admission fee for one car again?
Four dollars.
Four dollars, huh?
Four whole dollars?
well, that changes everything.
Oh, my goodness.
well, I only need to come back in here like, uh, what, 10,000 more times?
[LAUGHING]
In a week!
Do I have time for that?
-impossible.
-Oh, shoot.
[WEIRD AL YANKOVIC'S "LASAGNA" PLAYING ON STEREO]
You want-a some-a lasagna?
You hungry, buddy?
Of course!
I'm always hungry.
I was talking to my pet turtle.
Here you go.
That better not be my beef jerky.
[TURTLE CHEWING]
[BELCHES]
So, what's the big deal, Yogi?
This is the big deal, Boo Boo.
It's my masterpiece.
The Basket-Nabber 2000.
The most advanced pic-a-nic basket-steaIing technology ever invented.
Wow.
climb aboard.
This glider can steer dive, shoot rubber bands at pesky-type birds and even has an air bag.
Had an air bag.
Sorry, Yogi.
Not to worry.
We could cushion our landing with all the pic-a-nic baskets we swipe.
Now, how's that copiIot seat feel?
A little wobbly, Iike it's not tied on very tight.
You won't feel that in the air.
Get ready to fly faster than the speed of sandwich, Boo Boo.
We're gonna break the pic-a-nic barrier.
SMITH:
Yogi!
-Uh-oh.
That's not his happy voice.
Don't move.
I'm switching the glider into stealth mode.
stealth mode?
Wow.
How are you able to--?
Oh.
Ah, Mr. Ranger, sir.
welcome.
Can I interest you in a sody pop?
-There you go.
-When did you steal our vending machine?
I, um-
- I'm repairing it, sir.
This machine gives its sodas away for free when a bear kicks it.
Look, a camper has reported some missing fishing poles so I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say it was you.
Fishing poles?
Sir, I'm a bear.
If I wanted to catch fish, I would just use my....
Your paws, Yogi.
Isn't that kind of unsanitary?
What's that?
-What's what?
-That thing.
-What thing?
-The thing under the blanket.
-blanket?
-The object right behind you.
Oh.
Oh, that.
Heh.
A sculpture.
I'm sculpting now.
mostly landscapes.
And where's Boo Boo?
-France.
-What?
-That's not close by, is it?
-No.
Then he's in the bathroom.
-Excuse me.
-Wait!
[STAMMERING]
Hey, this isn't the bathroom.
I'm telling you, Mr. Ranger, it's not for stealing pic-a-nic baskets.
It says "Basket-Nabber 2000" right here, Yogi.
I do regret calling it that now.
I know I'm always saying, "Stay away from the campers."
This is different.
JeIIystone is in real trouble.
If I don't raise $30,000 in a week, this park's getting rezoned.
Rezoned?
What does that mean?
It means the park won't be a park anymore.
The city will use this land for something else.
So we have got to do everything we can to help save it.
Which means you have gotta stop stealing food so that campers will leave here happy.
But they do leave here happy.
Getting your food stolen by Yogi Bear is special.
people come here for that.
It's like catching a foul ball at a baseball game.
Nope.
It's like getting your food stolen at a baseball game.
Come on, Yogi.
would it really be so hard to be a regular bear?
You know, to forage for food, to walk around on all fours to hibernate a little, or a Iot.
If nature had meant for me to be a regular bear it wouldn't have given me such a good thought-cooker, sir.
I can't help it if my melon is full of smart juice.
Yogi, your melon is hurting this park.
There are repercussions to stealing people's picnic baskets.
Not in my experience, sir.
[MECHANISM TICKING]
[BELL RINGS]
[GRUNTS]
On the other hand--
[SCREAMS]
Ranger Smith, mind if I borrow the 'diIIa?
It's an emergency.
Somebody parked without parking decals.
Jones, I would really prefer it if you focused on just maintaining the park instead.
Let me deal with the visitors until you've had more experience.
Sorry, sir.
Guess that's just the eagle Scout in me, you know?
always wanting to be in control, be a leader.
Live up to this fanny pack full of merit badges.
You know that fanny pack is for first aid supplies, right?
A merit badge in first aid is the only supply I need, sir.
Right, but it might not be the only supply a hurt person needs.
You seen rachel?
Yeah, I saw her.
She was heading up to Lookout Mountain.
She can't be far.
I'II drive.
Let's roll.
Jones.
The sprawling beauty of JeIIystone Park.
A timeless stretch of wilderness untouched by man.
Oh.
Ranger Smith.
Wow, heh.
What's with the fancy outfit?
Dress greens.
I always wear dress greens in the evening.
You know, in case there's, you know--
-I don't know how to talk to girls.
-Oh.
Why do you think I spend so much time with animals?
AII you have to do is scratch their backside and you've got a friend for life.
Try that with people and all of a sudden you're the weird girl on the bus that nobody wants to sit next to.
Um, uh, listen.
I was wondering, you know, if you were--
I mean, it's getting late and we could, uh-- If you want.
I mean, it's not that-
- You don't-
- It's--
You know, it's not a worry.
Don't worry.
Did you just ask me to dinner?
Yes.
I did.
Heh.
-Good, you got that, huh?
-Yes.
I just thought, well, it's getting late.
I happen to know this great place.
-Very gourmet.
-really?
Where?
So close you won't believe it.
Wow, how did you ever find this place?
This is a four-star porch.
And fresh from the hot plate, I give you...
-...rack of Spam.
-Oh.
Wow.
Maybe "gourmet" was a bit of a stretch.
No, it actually looks wonderful.
Great.
You know, this really is a peaceful place.
It's something, isn't it?
I pretty much grew up here.
My father was a ranger when I was a kid and he turned this park into the number one tourist destination in the state.
I mean, it was a park, you know?
Like families came by the hundreds swam in the streams, hiked on the trails.
It was really something.
This is really good.
Anyway, I don't know.
Maybe it's my fault.
I spent so many years learning everything I couId about the park so I'd be a better ranger.
Maybe instead, I should have come up with a gimmick to get people to come here.
You know, change the name to Extreme JeIIystone.
-I think that it's perfect just the way it is.
-You do?
You're right.
absolutely.
There's no better place on earth.
YOGI:
Hey, Mr. Ranger.
-Except a place without him.
Evening, Mr. Ranger, sir.
Madame Moviemaker Lady.
And yes, I'm using the fancy tense to show you the utmost respect.
Hi.
Ha, ha.
What do you want, Yogi?
well, I was thinking about the park's prickly predicament and I would Iike to do my part to help.
This is all the money I have saved.
almost $100.
I was going to use it on myself, but I'd rather donate it to JeIIystone.
well, thank you, Yogi.
That's--
That is very sweet.
-Where does a bear get money from?
-That brown box by the parking lot.
The park donation box.
Yep.
But I want you to have it.
Consider it a gift to JeIIystone.
That won't be hard.
Look, guys, I appreciate the effort.
But what this park needs is visitors and lots of them.
well, I can help you there, sir.
Just make me a headliner.
I will rock this place.
-Kick it, Boo Boo.
-Kicking it.
[SIR MIX-A-LOT'S "BABY GOT BACK" PLAYING] I like big butts and I cannot lie You other brothers can't deny
That when a girl walks in With a itty-bitty waist
And a round thing in your face You get sprung
[MUSIC STOPS]
That's not gonna work either, Yogi.
You're right.
We need something flashier than music.
Not a problem.
I've got this water-skiing routine that will change the face of entertainment.
Got a little of everything.
Music, stunts, magic.
-And I jump over Boo Boo at the end.
-No, you don't.
-I want to try it.
-I don't care.
I hate to interrupt, but you're not gonna water-ski or dance or do anything that might disturb the campers, okay?
If what you really want to do is help save this park you will lay low, stay away from people.
Think you can do that for me?
You have my word, Mr. Ranger.
I will be seen, but not heard.
Or seen.
Fine.
Huh?
You guys done with that Spam?
-Get out of here.
-Okay.
Sheesh!
Hey.
What's this?
Seasons pass applications.
unfortunately, not a Iot of takers on those.
Fifty bucks for an entire year?
including camping fees?
That's a bargain.
If this were a place people wanted to visit throughout the year.
Maybe Yogi was on to something.
-You said the park was turning 100, right?
-Right.
well, a big event could really pull people in.
Yeah, you're right.
We could have, Iike, a moss collection day or a big squirrel chase.
-Or....
-Fireworks.
Yes.
exactly.
Why didn't I think of that?
We could host a big centennial festival.
people always show up for fireworks.
If even half of the people buy season passes the park makes enough money to stay open.
Right.
Let's get the word out.
I think I can help with that.
[PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY]
That is great.
How did we pay for it?
We didn't.
It was some fast-food restaurant but I rearranged the letters right before the plane took off.
[BOTH CHUCKLE]
You're very cool, rachel Johnson.
You're pretty cool yourself.
I do have my own kind of natural swagger.
[SCREAMS]
JeIIystone national Park, 100th year anniversary.
There'II be fireworks.
Just stay calm, Jones.
You should be patrolling in the armadillo making park-impacting decisions, but--
-Hey, 100th year anniversary.
-Thanks.
But you're not there yet.
You still have to follow orders.
Even if those orders make you look like a giant Cheez-It.
Mr. Mayor!
Hi, Mr. Mayor.
Why is it only going halfway down again?
Doesn't make any-
- No!
Oh, okay.
Is it a double tap or do I have to press it--?
-Oh, dang it!
-I got it, sir.
Yeah.
That's exactly what I did.
Let me see one of those filers.
"Come celebrate JeIIystone's 100th anniversary with fireworks and fun."
"And receive $10 off a season pass"?
He's gonna try to make the budget selling season passes.
[BOTH GROAN]
Yeah, ugh.
It's not a very good idea, in my opinion.
But nobody consulted me, because my job is just to maintain the park which is basically poking trash with a stick.
Yeah.
Yeah, why is a guy with your talent doing this insulting grunt work?
You should be running a park.
Yeah, but Ranger Smith says I have to pay my dues.
-Excuse me?
-What?
-He has to pay his dues?
Ha.
-Ha, ha.
Nobody pays dues anymore.
You gotta be in charge now while you still know everything.
-That's what I've been saying.
-Yeah.
Buddy, if it was up to me, you would be the head ranger of JeIIystone already.
-You'd put me in charge?
-In a second.
Yes.
You know, if this centennial festival didn't work out, I probably could relocate Smith.
You know, uh, maybe you could help me with that.
Make sure it doesn't succeed?
Wait, you mean, Iike, sabotage it?
No.
Oh, no, no, no.
No, I want you to be head ranger.
It just so happens that the only way to do that is to bring down this festival.
But spend the rest of your life as second-in-command if you Iike.
That's fine.
It's a perfectly valid life choice.
well, you just think about it and give me a call, okay?
Here's my card.
So long.
Hey.
Now why is it doing that?
No.
Boy Scouts are loyal, thrifty, kind....
Hey, you're back.
Hey, thanks for getting those filers out.
Let me tell you, this festival is gonna be huge.
Hey, Ranger Smith, how long do you think until I reach head ranger status?
Oh, no time at all.
I did it in 12 short years.
Ha, okay.
Are you serious?
Just be patient, Jones.
It'II be here before you know it.
This festival's gonna be great!
I can't wait 12 years.
[PEOPLE CHEERING AND LAUGHING]
Seasons pass order forms.
Seasons pass order forms.
Thank you.
Seasons pass order forms, $10 off today.
Ah, enjoy.
I can't take it, Boo Boo.
Two days without a tasty treat to eat?
And I have to sit up here while they're having a "happy birthday, JeIIystone" party?
[SNIFFING]
And they have doughnuts.
Doughnuts!
BOO BOO [OVER RADIO]:
Yogi, what are you doing?
-Yogi!
-I'm going.
Hey.
Wait.
Don't do it, Yogi.
You promised Mr. Ranger.
You're right.
I'm losing control, Boo Boo.
I don't know who's steering the ship.
Here.
I want you to handcuff me to this tree and not unlock it no matter what I say.
Okay, Yogi.
-Okay, unlock me.
-Huh?
It was a bad idea.
unlock me.
[GRUNTING]
unlock me!
[GROWLING]
Okay.
Here you go.
JONES:
folks, I hate to say this, but there are no spots left.
Forecast called for thunderstorms.
Severe lightning.
I fear for your young ones.
[CAR HORN HONKING]
We're out of fireworks, I'm afraid.
It's just sparkIers left.
Oh, no.
You look nice.
Your napkin matches your tie.
I don't need you to kiss up to me.
Got this guy for that.
That's a good point, sir.
You were gonna handle this situation, yet there are quite a few people here.
Sir, I tried.
AII last night I spent taking down fIiers.
I blocked the entrance with a vehicle to back up traffic.
I hung up "rabid squirrel" signs everywhere.
Those were hand-drawn.
-Nothing is working.
-You need to think of something, don't you?
Or maybe you're just not head ranger material.
Mr. Mayor.
Mayor's yes man.
So glad you could join us.
I saved you a nice spot next to the porta-potties.
Oh, well, thank you.
well, that's very thoughtful.
You know, I'm just so glad that these festivities are going so well, Smith.
I just hope nothing goes wrong.
[HORN HONKING]
We are gonna pull this off, Jonesy.
I've seen hundreds of people filling out seasons pass order forms.
The weather's great.
The fireworks, ready to go.
Even Yogi's staying out of the way.
Yogi.
[GROANING]
Hey, guys.
Sorry, just wandering around, bored out of my mind.
Bored?
But the 100th anniversary extravaganza's going on.
Yeah, more like 100th anniversary Iame-aganza.
You know, because it's so lame.
people see fireworks every day in the city.
They thought they'd see something different here.
I knew it.
I should be out there doing my water-ski routine.
I'm a shining star and Ranger Smith is holding me back.
I don't know, Yogi.
Mr. Ranger is usually right about these things.
No, Boo Boo, Ranger Smith is in denial.
I mean, he's lost it, you know?
I saw him a couple days ago.
He was filling his pockets with dirt.
He said he's gonna start moving the park to his apartment piece by piece.
-How big is his apartment?
-There's still time.
I won't be able to do the haIf-hour artistic program but that was more for me anyway.
These people need the razzIe-dazzIe.
I don't think we've practiced the razzIe-dazzIe.
You're not supposed to, Boo Boo.
That's where it gets the razzle.
Yogi, I really don't think we shouId--
Boo Boo, you've tried to stop my brilliant ideas with common sense a thousand times.
Has it ever worked?
No.
Then let's go, go, go.
What does that taste like?
unemployment?
-I'm sorry.
-Yeah.
Thanks again for helping with the fireworks.
I don't know where Jones disappeared to.
My pleasure.
You know, um, rachel, I've been wanting to tell you...
-...well, how much I--
-Ranger--
No, please, Iet me get through this.
I'm not very good with words.
But I have never felt so gushy.
Ha-ha-ha.
-You know?
-Ranger--
You know what I did?
I went and I wrote a song about you.
It's like this:
[HUMMING]
Oh, no.
[SINGING] I saw you at the station
Had a heart palpitation
My sickness was love And you're the medication
Rachel
-Rachel
-The microphone is on.
SMITH:
And it comes around again
Rachel, Rachel, Rachel
The microphone is on.
Yes, the mic--
[CLEARS THROAT THEN LAUGHS]
Hi.
hello and welcome to the 100th anniversary of JeIIystone!
[CHEERING]
Thank you.
It is so wonderful to see so many people here today.
I've noticed many of you filling out your seasons pass order forms.
We're more than happy to collect those after the fireworks.
But first, please, sit back, get comfortable and enjoy the show!
-Terrific.
-Mr.
Mayor?
[POISON'S "NOTHIN' BUT A GOOD TIME" PLAYING ON STEREO]
That's not the right music.
I'II take it from here, Mr. Ranger!
Oh, no.
full speed ahead, Boo Boo.
Okay.
Not bad, eh, Boo Boo?
Looking good, Yogi.
-This cannot be happening.
-Oh, it's happening.
[YOGI STAMMERING]
hello, JeIIystone!
[CROWD CHEERING]
No, don't encourage him!
They love me.
I can do no wrong.
Watch this.
AII right, Boo Boo!
Turn up the heat!
Phase two, go.
I'm an unstoppable water-skiing machine.
[LAUGHING]
Ta-da!
Oh, wait.
There's more.
How about if I heat things up?
[SMITH WHIMPERS]
[GROANING]
Don't need nothin' but a good time
And it don't get better than this
Yogi!
Yogi, your cape.
I know.
It is magnificent.
And on fire.
Huh?
Fire!
[GROANING]
-Turn the boat!
-Huh?
-Turn, Boo Boo!
-Hang on, Yogi!
Too much razzIe!
[CROWD SCREAMING]
[GASPS]
-Nice one.
-Thanks.
[RACHEL GASPS]
Jump!
[CHUCKLING]
[CHEERING]
[ALL GASP]
[MURMURING]
Let's go.
[SCREAMING AND SHOUTING]
MAN:
Out of my way!
[CHUCKLING]
This could not have gone more perfectly.
Hey, you got a little, uh....
Never mind.
Let's go.
[SIGHS]
[WOOD SNAPPING AND CREAKING]
Mr. Ranger, I thought--
Yogi, that's the problem.
AII the thinking.
Hey, you know what would be great?
If you didn't think.
If you could just be a regular bear.
You know, sitting in the woods, minding his own business.
But no, you're different.
You're smart.
And you'd rather spend your days being selfish and destructive while everyone else pays the price.
But I guess it wasn't enough, screwing up my Iife.
No, this time you had to go and bring down this entire park.
So tell me, Yogi how smart are you now?
Hey, there!
That was quite a show you put on yesterday.
Ha-ha-ha.
I can't wait to see what you do with this.
That's your new assignment.
Evergreen Park.
Oh, I think you're just going to find it delightful.
Oh, and, uh, Ranger Jones is gonna be taking over here.
Ranger Jones?
well, I have got a press conference to plan.
You see, it turns out I've saved the city.
Don't forget to vote, my friend.
Brown for governor!
Ha-ha-ha.
He's not gonna vote for me, is he?
Uh, no.
You did everything you could.
Doesn't matter.
This park needed a ranger who could make it popular again.
I'm just some guy who knows how old every tree is.
Fat lot of good that did JeIIystone.
Face it.
You and I are just two people who care about things that nobody else does and that's why we're alone.
Or maybe that's why we found each other.
Did you ever think of that?
rachel, you and this park have one thing in common.
You both deserve a better man than me.
I can't believe he's really gone.
Yogi, are you okay?
I'm done being special, Boo Boo.
Ranger Smith was right.
My whole life, I've been different.
But it's done nothing but hurt people.
The world would be better off if I was only as smart as the average bear.
Yogi, what are you doing?
I'm leaving, Boo Boo.
-I am going to forage for food in the wild.
-Huh?
Might even catch some fish.
With my paws.
[SIGHS]
I'm just gonna grab a little something for the road.
Some chips and soda.
And this.
Peach pie.
Any more of that casserole?
Top shelf.
I'II be out there.
Fending for myself.
Foraging for food in the wild.
[METAL CLANKING]
Goodbye, horsepower Iimiter.
There's a new head ranger in town.
Let's see what you got.
[GRUNTING]
Perfect.
[SOBBING]
I'm sorry, Ranger Smith.
No more food.
No more pic-a-nickers.
How could this get any worse?
[THUNDER BOOMING]
Oh.
Ah, Evergreen Park.
Yes, it is simply delightful.
[GIGGLING]
-Come on.
-I've got it, sir.
This is unbelievable.
Ah, Evergreen Park.
lovely, isn't it?
This isn't a park.
I can barely breathe in here.
Look at these trees.
They're all plastic.
Oh, no, they're real.
It's just years of smog and pollution have left a pIastic-Iike coating on them.
Think people will be happy you're closing the most beautiful park in the state?
well, they will be when they find out it's making the city rich and giving each citizen a check for $1000.
How is that even possible?
Oh, well, it turns out that there has been some agricultural interest in the park.
And it's a Iot more profitable than people in station wagons making s'mores.
[LAUGHING]
Have a good day, Ranger Smith.
I hate this car.
I hate it.
[GRUNTS]
[CHAINSAWS BUZZING]
Yeah!
Oh, hey, there he is.
Ha-ha-ha.
Whoa, hey, Mr. Mayor!
I, uh....
Just finishing some stamping.
You are doing great, Jones.
I knew you were the guy for this job.
Quick thing.
You'II probably notice some giant trucks rumbling by.
We're just clearing a little patch of trees for my press conference.
No big deal.
Um, wait, you're cutting down trees?
Oh, yeah.
well, just a few.
It's nothing to worry about.
actually gonna improve the park quite a bit.
I'II bet one of the first things you noticed as head ranger is that you need more clear spaces here, and you are absolutely right.
Now you can host concerts and Boy Scout jamborees.
That's a pretty smart move there, Head Ranger Jones.
I have some other park improvements I want to run by you.
Oh, splendid, yes.
I think I have a few moments to hear those.
Look into the security arrangements for tomorrow.
I don't want any surprises.
I'II hear what Ding-Dong has to say.
What do you got?
I'm hungrier than the average bear.
I wish I couId find a bush that tasted like birthday cake.
Gotcha.
[GROANS]
Pretend it's a gummy worm.
Pretend it's a gummy worm.
[GASPS]
Yogi, I've been looking everywhere for you.
Not now, Boo Boo.
I'm busy foraging.
[GROANS]
[SHOUTS]
Come on, Yogi.
JeIIystone is in trouble.
We need your help.
Nothing I can do, Boo Boo.
I'm average now.
My brain is out of business.
I wouldn't even be standing if my paws didn't hurt.
Quit feeling sorry for yourself.
You know you're not an average bear.
Hey, hey, Boo Boo.
You're right, I'm not.
I failed at that too.
Hey, come back here.
You've gotta save JeIIystone.
YOGI:
What are you doing?
I'm not--
Yogi, you have to use your smarts for good.
And if you can't see that, maybe you are just an average bear.
Come on.
[GRUNTING]
Now do you understand?
What's going on, Boo Boo?
I don't know.
But whatever it is I think they're just getting started.
Boo Boo get my collar.
Nobody is gonna hurt JeIIystone.
Where are we going, Yogi?
We can't get JeIIystone back alone, Boo Boo.
My thinker is good, but Ranger Smith's is better.
He was going to a place called Evergreen Park.
That's right.
In the city.
The city?
That's a Iong walk.
Don't be silly, Boo Boo.
I've already got a smarty-smart cheat to keep our feet off the street.
Get ready for it.
Here it comes.
Run, Boo Boo, run!
Hurry, Boo Boo.
I think we gotta jump for it.
Ready?
AII aboard.
Good.
Yogi, grab my paw.
[GROANING]
[GRUNTING]
Sorry.
[YOGI SHOUTING]
Boo Boo, Boo Boo, Boo Boo!
I gotta get--!
I guess it makes a stop here.
Yup.
Looks like Evergreen Park is about two miles away from here.
Two miles?
I'II have to tap into my emergency rations.
Snack break.
Come on, Yogi.
We need to keep moving.
It's not that far and it's all downhill.
downhill?
Excuse me, Mr. Dirty Shopper.
Any chance my friend and I might borrow your wheeIy-basket?
Is that chocolate?
[YOGI AND BOO BOO LAUGHING]
Okay, Boo Boo, keep it steady.
I'm okay, Ma.
Just--
Yeah, no, it's not JeIIystone, but at Ieast there's nothing here to drive me crazy.
-Hey, Mr. Ranger.
-Hey, Yogi.
[CART CRASHES]
AII right, Ma, I gotta call you back.
What are you guys doing here?
We need your help, Mr. Ranger, sir.
But don't worry, my days of goofing things up for you are over.
MAN:
Hey, move that shopping cart!
[SHOUTING]
I'm okay!
I'm just gonna put this over here.
What do you want?
I don't have a life left for you to ruin anymore.
Sir, I know I messed things up and I'm sorry.
I never meant to.
You and Boo Boo are the best friends I ever had.
And I've never done anything but think of myself.
And now JeIIystone is just gonna be a big field of stumps.
What?
They've started cutting down the trees.
"agricultural interest" is logging.
Oh, no, not our JeIIystone.
We have to save it, sir.
I don't think we can save it, Yogi.
I'm no smarter than you.
I lost JeIIystone.
I lost rachel.
It's over.
Mr. Ranger, I've learned two things from stealing pic-a-nic baskets.
One:
light mayonnaise is not nearly as good as regular mayonnaise.
And two: you can't fall if you never stop trying.
You have to fight for the things you love whether it's a park, a girl or a roast beef sandwich.
Don't give up now.
We're all JeIIystone's got.
You're right, Yogi.
JeIIystone's too important to give up on.
We gotta try.
Come on.
-Shotgun.
-Aw.
I never thought I'd see this.
Happy 100th anniversary, JeIIystone.
Isn't that Miss Movie Lady?
RACHEL:
I gotta get in there.
You don't understand.
Let me in, please.
No can do.
Park is closed to the public until the press conference.
Mayor's orders.
Then go talk to him.
tell him what I told you.
I'm sorry.
I don't really take orders from a--
I lived with gorillas, pal.
I know rage.
You do not want me to go gorilla on you.
[SCREAMS]
Uh, I'II speak to the mayor.
-Thank you.
-Okay.
rachel.
Ranger Smith.
I didn't think I'd ever see you again.
I know.
I don't know what I was thinking.
I think you're perfect.
I think any guy in the world would be lucky just to stand next to you.
You really mean that?
Of course I do.
It's just, when I lost JeIIystone, I felt like such a failure.
But losing you has felt much, much worse.
I'm like....
I'm like a genus without a phylum.
That's the sweetest thing anyone's ever said to me.
-So, um, we're still here.
YOGI:
Mm-hm.
Oh, right.
Ahem.
So, what are you doing here?
-Come on, I'II show you.
-Okay.
I was reviewing the documentary footage from Boo Boo's camera and I saw this.
Oh, my.
I see it.
I have a bald spot back there!
I'm not talking about you, Yogi.
I'm talking about this.
Yeah, it's my pet turtle.
He hangs out at the cave all the time.
True.
You know they don't come out of that shell?
I tried one time to see what one would look like without it.
But, nope, they're sewn in.
This is no regular turtle.
See the bulging frog-Iike eyes and the really wide mouth?
A frog-mouthed turtle?
Yup, Rafetus swinhoei.
SMITH:
But those are extinct.
For a hundred years, but apparently one still exists.
And he lives in there.
But they won't let me through the gates to go find him.
But if JeIIystone has an endangered species living in it, then--
It has to be protected as a park.
That's the Iaw.
That turtle can save this park.
Now I feel kinda bad about using him as a foot stool.
CHIEF:
You've seen the filmmaker?
well, we spoke.
About extinct turtles.
You're telling me there is an extinct turtle living here in the park?
According to Miss Johnson's film, there is.
An extinct turtle?
That's great.
Visitors will come from miles around to see an endangered species.
Yes, they will, and that is great.
We need to find this turtle.
Just to keep it safe.
Have a vet check it out.
The whole deal.
The sooner we get to him the better.
Oh, we need a head ranger who's good enough to find it.
Someone who thinks like a turtle.
I am that head ranger.
well, then why are you still here?
He's back.
Come on.
You need to let us in this park.
That turtle needs protection.
Don't worry about the turtle.
We're handling it.
We'II make sure he's put in a nice zoo.
No.
A turtle that's endangered can't be removed from its natural habitat.
It's against federal law.
It is?
Wow, I've never heard of that law in chapter 4, subsection 6 of the wildlife Protection Mandate.
Don't worry, Mr. Ranger, sir.
That turtle is safe.
These people have no idea where my cave is.
The turtle's in the talking bear's cave.
JONES [OVER RADIO]:
Copy.
Wow, that backfired.
Okay.
You know what?
Fine,
You win.
What are you doing?
I have a plan.
One of the advantages of having lived here since I was a kid is I know this park like the back of my hand.
Let's go!
hold on, boys.
AII right.
Hey, there, little buddy.
hello, there.
Uh-oh.
Sorry about that.
-Mayor Brown.
-This had better be good, Jones.
JONES:
I found the turtle.
He was in Boo Boo's sleeping bag.
But now I have him secure at the picnic area.
Jones, you're a hero.
Sit tight.
My chief of staff is on his way to get him.
Copy that.
Head Ranger Jones over and out.
SMITH:
He found the turtle.
Dang it.
Can't cross those rapids.
There's no way to get to him from here.
well, there is one way.
There it is.
My masterpiece.
-You really think you can pull this off?
-I know I can, sir.
I'm gonna snatch that basket-type turtle box and fly away like a fuzzy bird.
And I've got the best copiIot a basket-snatching machine could have.
-I don't know how to fly this thing.
-well, you'II pick it up as we go.
SMITH:
Okay.
Look, just be careful, okay, Yogi?
Copy that, ground control.
Basket-Nabber 2000 ready for takeoff.
-flight systems check.
Boo Boo?
-What?
-Can you reach the pedals?
-If I point my toes.
flight systems are go.
Remember what I told you about flying gliders, Yogi.
Don't fight the wind.
As long as the wind wants me to snatch up that turtle, we'II get along just fine.
-AII right.
YOGI:
Start pedaling, Boo Boo.
AII right.
Here goes.
YOGI:
hold on, Boo Boo.
Fasten your seat belt.
But there isn't one.
YOGI:
Here we go!
BOO BOO:
Oh, Yogi!
The wind should carry you south!
We'II meet you there!
Take your time, Mr. Ranger.
This machine is equipped with landing gear.
We'II touch down as soft as a feather.
Whoops.
This is your captain speaking.
We'II reach our turtle target in about two minutes.
So let's go ahead and start the beverage service.
-Yogi, look out.
-Aah!
-Trees!
-Yes, trees!
[BOTH SCREAMING]
I got it.
I got it.
I got it.
I don't got it!
BOO BOO:
pull up.
-Hey!
-pull up!
You did it, Yogi.
Oh.
Yeah.
Ha-ha-ha.
Great job, Jones.
I'II get this guy to the city zoo.
-The city zoo?
-Yep.
They got a nice spot ready in the reptile house.
The city zoo doesn't have a reptile house.
They're building one.
-Who is?
-builders.
Sure you're trying to protect the turtle?
Yeah, we love turtles.
Then you won't mind if I hold onto him until I notify the wildlife Federation, right?
AII right.
You're gonna find this out in a few hours anyway, so I might as well tell you.
We gotta lose this turtle to sell logging rights to the park.
Logging?
The whole park?
Yeah, but who cares?
It's still a park, just without trees.
And they'II grow back.
Yeah, in like 200 years.
It doesn't matter.
Your career is what matters.
Ha-ha-ha.
turtle target acquired.
I need 20 more feet of altitude.
Engage the hand pedals.
You couldn't put the hand pedals by you?
There's a suggestion box behind the seat, Boo Boo.
[GROANS]
Wait, you don't want to approach him like that.
He's poisonous.
He's in a basket.
But he can spit.
Poison.
He'II aim at your eyes.
melt them out of your head.
-I'm telling you, that turtle is deadly.
-What are you looking at?
-Hook me in, Boo Boo.
-Okay.
And fire!
Here you go.
Huh?
Yogi, wait!
Here I come!
He's going for the turtle.
-Mind if I borrow this?
-Hey!
[YOGI LAUGHS]
Look, Boo Boo!
We got the turtle!
Hey, why aren't you in your seat?
That bear knows how to steal a basket.
Everybody after that glider now!
I'm not gonna let a bear make me look bad.
Been there, buddy.
We're drifting too far right.
I wanna get us outside the park.
Don't fight the wind, Yogi.
Remember what Miss Movie Lady said about--
Never mind.
YOGI:
Hang on, Boo Boo.
-What do we do now?
Did you check the safety manual?
It's just a picture of us screaming.
[BOTH SCREAMING]
We've got to deject, Boo.
Don't you mean eject?
Eject is up.
Deject is down.
In case of emergency your seat can also be used as a flotation device!
[YOGI LAUGHING]
[GRUNTING]
Hey, told you.
Nothing to worry about.
I actually think I wasn't worried enough.
Let me see how our little passenger is doing.
Wonder why they call him a frog-mouthed turtle anyway?
Hey!
SMITH:
Hey, guys, over here!
Yogi, grab the branch.
Got you, Mr. Ranger, sir.
[SMITH AND RACHEL GRUNT]
-welcome aboard.
SMITH:
Yogi.
We were trying to get you off the raft.
Yeah, that makes more sense.
You guys did it.
You saved him.
[CAR HORN HONKS]
Oh, no.
They're gonna catch us downstream.
I'm on it.
No, Yogi, don't.
problem solved.
They can't catch us now.
Yeah, because now we are headed straight for the JeIIyjarring Rapids.
[GRUNTS]
-Grab a paddle.
-Tuck your head in, little buddy.
Brace yourselves.
Oh, come on, turtle.
Don't worry, I put safety belts in this raft for just such an occasion.
You better hang on.
Mr. Ranger said--
YOGI:
We're gonna be fine, Boo Boo.
Just sit back and let Mother Nature carry us to--
[ALL SCREAMING]
I think Mother Nature's kind of cranky today.
You okay, Yogi?
Fine!
turtle!
YOGI:
Who's that?
I can't see.
Come here, turtle.
-Got him.
SMITH:
Good work, Boo Boo.
We made it through the rapids.
Yeah, but that means the falls are just up ahead.
hold on!
[SCREAMING]
Yogi.
Yogi.
Now who says there are no rides at JeIIystone?
Yeah, you've definitely got the thrill part down.
ANNOUNCER:
Please, take your seats.
The press conference is about to begin.
That's over a mile away.
We're never gonna make that in time.
[ALL GASP]
-Ranger Jones?
-I messed up pretty bad, sir.
-I know.
It's okay.
-I wanted to be head ranger.
Because you're a good head ranger and I value leadership.
I have a merit badge--
Can we talk later?
We're pressed for time.
Yes.
Get in.
[SIREN WAILING]
YOGI:
Boo Boo!
Boo Boo!
Wait up!
SMITH:
well, well.
Guess who we found.
Starts with T and ends with a-- "UrtIe"?
It's over.
call off the logging.
The law says this park is now a protected nature preserve.
You think I care about what the Iaw says?
Or about some endangered "frog-mouthed turtle"?
Or some stupid park for families to have a picnic in?
I care about power, you pinheads!
And I'm gonna get it.
Nobody knows this turtle exists.
And nobody ever will.
You found the turtle.
Get this thing out of here before anybody else sees it.
-rachel!
-Oh!
Yogi!
BOO BOO:
Yogi, here!
Thank you.
-Yogi.
-I'm sorry.
He was open.
Ha, ha.
Now if you'II excuse me, I have a press conference.
I can still tell them what you did.
Oh, yeah?
Without that turtle or a scrap of evidence, go right ahead.
well, you might as well tell them Bigfoot is here.
Ha-ha-ha.
And do yourself a favor, there, ranger.
Try to keep your dignity.
It's all you have left.
You know what?
I'm taking care of this thing myself this time.
That's the only way to make sure the job is done right.
But that's why I'm the mayor's right-hand man, right?
Because I don't make mistakes.
Hey, you know, people are wondering:
"Why should I vote for Mayor Brown to be governor?"
well, how about this:
Mayor Brown just turned the city's budget from a deficit into a surplus!
And put $1000 into the pocket of every citizen of this city!
Now before I sign the paperwork that will save the city why don't you all take a look at my first campaign ad for governor?
ANNOUNCER:
Mayor Brown, the right choice for governor.
We're out of time.
Must be something we can do.
Anybody have any ideas?
well, I guess this is going to be a pretty sad documentary, huh?
Are you--?
Is he still filming?
I needed more footage, so I told him to keep it rolling.
I can plug that into the video feed right up there.
I just need a way to distract the guards.
I think we can take care of that.
ANNOUNCER:
He supports public safety.
[JOURNEY'S "DON'T STOP BELIEVING" PLAYING ON TV]
All right, hurry up, people.
Focus.
Let's go save those orphans.
YOGI:
Hey, hey, hey, check this out!
-Kick it, Boo Boo.
-Kicking it.
Don't stop believing
[LAUGHING]
Hold on to that feeling
ANNOUNCER:
He's tough on crime.
[SHOUTS]
Hey, hey, hey, look at this.
Keep your eye on the little bear.
Look at the skills.
Amazing!
[GRUNTING]
ANNOUNCER:
And here's what Mayor Brown proudly has to say about protecting our natural resources.
[MUSIC STOPS]
You think I care about what the law says?
Or about some endangered "frog-mouthed turtle"?
-Some stupid park for families to picnic in?
-No.
No.
No. I care about power, you pinheads!
Oh, boy.
Nobody knows this turtle exists.
And nobody ever will.
[BOOING AND JEERING]
[LAUGHING]
There's about to be a riot out there.
I need you out front.
[GRUNTS]
Okay.
No.
Hey, wait.
Wait, wait, wait.
please, please, please.
That was not real.
Trust me, there is no such thing as a frog-mouthed turtle.
He's right next to me, isn't he?
Okay.
-We did it, Yogi!
-Up high, Boo Boo!
-AII right!
JONES:
We got it!
Yogi!
AII right, and now....
Miss Moviemaker Lady.
SMITH:
Hey, we did it.
[LAUGHING]
Hey, Mr. Ranger!
RACHEL:
Come on, Boo Boo.
-Okay.
I was wrong, Yogi.
I say from here on, we just be proud of who we are and fight for the things we're passionate about, Iike this park.
And rachel.
And pic-a-nic baskets?
And pic-a-nic baskets.
-Aw, come here!
-No, you don't have to--
Okay.
AII right, that's--
I'm good.
[CROWD CHATTERING]
RACHEL:
Here you go, Boo Boo.
Take good care of him.
Hey, there, buddy.
No, no, no, I never took a kickback on anything in my entire career.
No one loves turtles more than I do.
And nature in general.
I Iove trees.
Oh, no, you don't!
[GROWLS]
gorilla?
HimaIayan snow leopard.
Huh.
welcome to JeIIystone, home of the frog-mouthed turtle.
And brochures.
I'm Ranger Jones.
NARRATOR:
Ah, yes, Jellystone Park.
A wonderful little piece of paradise.
Where families come and soak up the tranquility of nature.
It's a place that--
[MACHINE WHIRRING]
Huh?
Never mind.
MAN:
Hey, hey, hey!
[CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY]
Hi.
welcome.
well, I am certainly glad that you are gonna be staying in JeIIystone for a while.
And what animal will you be observing?
well, I thought I would observe the courting rituals of the American ranger.
I happen to hear the American ranger is a very charming intelligent, attractive species.
One that always keeps his cool.
Even when basket-steaIing bears push his buttons?
Listen, Yogi will be Yogi.
And I'm just not gonna let it bother me anymore.
Besides I have more important things to focus on.
Oh....
[LAUGHING]
I....
Let's-
- Let's try that again.
[HORN HONKING]
[GASPING]
Afternoon, Mr. Ranger, sir!
Hi, Miss Movie Lady!
[BARKING]
Yogi!
I Iove this place.
SMITH:
Yogi!
Hey!
NARRATOR:
Jellystone Park.
One of the nation's oldest and most beautiful stretches of wilderness.
For years, families have headed out from the busy city eager to enjoy a little camping, fishing and, of course, observing the park's natural wildlife.
Boo Boo, I think it's time I introduced myself to that pic-a-nic basket.
You know, Yogi, we could just hunt for food.
All the other animals do.
Boo Boo, a pic-a-nic basket has everything a bear needs.
And I'm not just talking about the treats and snack-type goodies.
No.
A pic-a-nic basket holds a lot more than that.
It holds dreams.
[WHISPERING] What are we looking at?
I don't know.
Hook me in.
[IN NORMAL VOICE] You sure it'll work, Yogi?
Well, you know, Boo Boo, I'm smarter than the average bear!
[SHOUTING]
[CHUCKLING]
All right!
[GASPS]
[SHOUTING]
[GRUNTS]
[CHUCKLING]
[GROANS]
MAN:
Ranger Smith!
Sorry about that.
We got a 4-23 in Redwood Valley, sir.
-A what?
-A bear disturbance.
-I think it's probably--
-I know who it is.
Why didn't you just say "bear disturbance"?
Well, I....
Uh, well, it sounds cooler.
I mean, we're park rangers, sir.
You know:
"To protect and preserve."
Did you just make that motto up?
Yeah, I did.
Do you like it?
Ranger Jones, you know that, well, being a park ranger, it's not about mottos.
It's about keeping the park safe.
That's where the glory is.
Protecting all of this.
Yeah, I know.
Besides, that motto was still in the testing phase.
It's not like I made T-shirts or anything.
Heh, no, of course not.
Okay, I'm gonna deal with that 4-23.
Okay, copy that, sir.
Um, I'm actually gonna hop in the Armadillo, make some rounds.
Jones, you know that the Armadillo is for head ranger use only.
I might need it at any moment to deal with a park emergency.
Why don't you finish stacking those trail maps?
Yeah, sure.
Okay.
Yeah, because that's what future head rangers do, they stack maps.
Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy!
Our days of getting banged up to grab a meal are over, Boo Boo.
From now on, the pic-a-nic baskets are going to fall into our arms.
Soldering iron.
BOO BOO:
Here you go.
-Thank you.
Okay.
That should do it.
Test rock.
Okay, Yogi.
YOGI:
Weight sensor triggered.
Basket in position.
Launch spring starts coiling.
Firing pin drops.
And....
[BELL RINGS]
Bull's-eye!
I'm so smart it hurts!
You're standing on the soldering iron.
Or it's that.
[SHOUTING]
Hot, hot, hot!
There's the test rock.
Now we just wait here for a pic-a-nic basket to fall into our arms.
Are you sure about this, Yogi?
People seem to get pretty mad when you--
A genius never questions his instincts, Boo Boo.
When you have a mind like mine you can't blink or you'll put a kink in your think.
Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.
We've got our first customers.
And they have pie!
I wonder what kind it is.
SMITH:
Yogi, are you out here?
-It's Mr. Ranger.
-Aah!
Get rid of the test rock.
Destroy the evidence. I was never here.
SMITH:
Look-
- Ow!
Hello, Mr. Ranger, sir.
Did you just--?
Did you guys--?
Did you--?
Oh, never mind.
Look, there was a complaint about a bear interfering with a family picnic.
I see.
And you'd like us to mount some sort of investigation?
No, I think it was you.
What?
!
How can you even think that?
Are you feverish?
Let me press my lips against your forehead.
Wait!
You're not pressing your lips against my forehead.
Hey, it's a lot better than the way they take my temperature.
[CHUCKLES]
No, look, Yogi, we've been over this many times.
Bears are supposed to avoid people, not run around stealing their food.
I agree, sir.
That's why my friend Boo Boo and I would never think of disturbing a family's pic-a-nic.
[BELL RINGS AND WOOD CLUNKS]
[WOMAN SCREAMS]
Huh.
It missed.
[GROANS]
Good day, Mr. Ranger, sir.
We'll keep our eyes peeled.
I wonder if he noticed the pie.
JONES [CHOPPY OVER RADIO]:
Ra-
- Smith.
You have a vis-
- Over.
Didn't understand a word of that, Jones.
-Sorry.
Some lady's here to see you.
-Send her in.
-Okay.
I'll be in the Armadillo.
-Or you could be....
-Map stacking?
-Map stacking.
-Ranger Smith?
-Yes.
-Hello.
I'm Rachel Johnson.
-Hi.
I was hoping to talk to you about filming a documentary here.
Sure.
I can handle you for that.
Handle that for you.
Sorry.
My work isn't-- My brain isn't working right.
-I must have inhaled some jimsonweed.
-Oh.
Datura stramonium.
It's known to cause delirium...
-...cramping and nausea.
Heh.
-Cramping and nausea.
You've read The North American Wilderness Guide.
Yeah, I like to highlight all the plants and animals I see.
-I like to-
- Me too.
-Ha, ha!
Yeah.
[SMITH STAMMERING]
Ranger Smith.
At your service.
You want to film a documentary in Jellystone?
Yes.
I sent you a letter about a month ago.
-Written on a piece of bark.
-That was you!
Yes.
I'm sorry about that.
I was in Sumatra, living among the orangutans at the time and they get very nervous if they spot anything from the modern world.
Really?
Wow, that's amazing.
Then what did you use for ink?
Bird poop and spit.
Impressive.
So, what are you here to film?
Well, I was hoping to shoot a local species.
Something to really capture the beauty of a national park.
Terrific.
What animal were you thinking?
I heard you had an unusual brown bear.
-Brown bear?
-Yes.
One that talks?
Those are so rare.
-None that I can think of.
-Named Yogi?
Wears a hat and a tie?
No, that doesn't ring a bell.
I think he's standing on the roof, trying to steal your lunchbox.
YOGI:
I smell PB and J.
[YOGI SHOUTING]
I'm all done.
Oh, right.
That Yogi.
Bankrupt?
No, no, no.
We're a city.
Cities don't go bankrupt.
They do when they're broke, sir.
We just have to find some money somewhere.
I'm about to run for governor.
How am I gonna do that when my own city is bankrupt?
Okay, yes.
Thank you.
-Here's the invoice, Mr. Mayor.
-Yikes!
Wow.
Ha.
I'm gonna pretend I didn't see that.
Just bill it to the city, okay?
Thank you.
Ugh.
How did we ever go so broke?
-I think we just spent too much.
-Hmm.
Is there anything we can sell?
You already sold the public golf course to condo developers two of the three fire stations to that frozen yogurt company.
You were selling the library, but it burned down.
Oh, yeah.
That was gonna be one of those make-your-own-doughnut places.
-No.
-Yeah.
-If you could dream it up, you could make it.
-Ah.
Love those.
We gotta think of something here.
Well, if we don't have anything to sell, maybe we can profit off what we can't sell.
I don't understand those words.
Like when we sold the bottling rights to the water in Lake Beuclair.
-We made a fortune.
-Yeah.
Sinkhole Beuclair is a great place to throw old mattresses.
-Oh, yeah.
-Hmm.
We just don't have any more resources to exploit.
Or do we?
Jellystone.
If we rezone Jellystone Park as agricultural land, we can sell the logging rights.
Here.
This company says they'll give us thousands of dollars an acre just to cut down the trees or something.
That'll be enough to balance the budget and give each citizen a big fat check.
[LAUGHING]
You have any idea how many votes that'll buy me?
-Enough to be the next governor?
-Exactly.
You're fine, Yogi.
It's just a few scrapes and bruises.
I don't know, Mr. Ranger.
I'm pretty sure I heard my spine snap.
Well, you wouldn't be able to stand.
And you wouldn't be able to eat.
I'm okay!
Yogi, Boo Boo, I would like to introduce you to Rachel Johnson who's here to make a nature documentary.
[GROWLS]
What the heck was that?
I was saying hello.
I lived in a den with brown bears for six months.
Only bear I've ever lived with is Boo Boo.
And he only makes that sound after he's eaten baked beans.
Heh, heh.
I have problems with baked beans.
And for a little bear, he makes a lot of stink.
Okay, I have some fantastic river otters you can film instead.
-Could get a hat and tie on the slow one.
-No, you know, I really, really like these two.
-Would you guys mind if I shoot you?
YOGI:
Huh?
[RAPID FOOTSTEPS]
Yogi, I think she meant with a camera.
Yes.
Of course with a camera.
Heh-heh-heh.
I knew that.
But not just any camera.
This isn't gonna make me look fat, is it?
RACHEL:
No, you are gonna look great.
Okay, just a few more adjustments.
[WHISPERING] Please, excuse the pre-tied bow tie.
My mornings are often rushed.
It's fine, Boo Boo.
This is going to be a whole new perspective for a documentary.
The Boo Boo cam will capture the true wilderness in all its natural glory.
No other human in sight.
That sounds like my apartment.
Ha, ha.
Uh, you know, because I live alone.
Well, plenty of women have tried to change that.
It's just, I haven't found one that--
-Likes you?
-What?
No.
No, that--
Will return your calls?
Can you stop helping, please?
Sir, I can see you like this lady.
But your courting rituals need work.
What you need to do is follow her around for two days making snorting sounds.
Then fight any male that looks at her.
And then, of course, urinate on her to mark her as your territory.
Works every time.
I got it under control, Yogi.
-Boo Boo, you're rolling.
-Cool.
Yogi Bear, a brown bear commonly found in North America and Alaska.
Weighing up to 1800 pounds, brown bears are also the national animal of Finland.
I don't think you have to narrate.
But I liked where you were going with it, Boo Boo.
-I was hooked.
-Really?
Yes.
Now try to film from flattering angles, if you know what I mean.
Pic-a-nic baskets may be delicious on the lips, but they're a lifetime on the hips.
Oh, no.
Ranger Smith!
Ranger Smith.
The mayor's here.
What's he doing here?
Why didn't he give us more warning?
I have to secure the area.
All units, lock down the park.
Repeat, lock down the park.
Jones, you know I'm the only other ranger here, right?
Yeah.
-Ranger Smith, we need to talk.
-You could've just called.
BROWN:
Yeah, but I thought this would be more friendly.
I'm really working on my people skills.
Anyway, I am closing your park down.
-Okay.
-What?
Oh, yeah, this place just costs the city way too much money.
Jellystone hasn't made its operating budget in 1 0 years.
You know, it's hard to compete with all those amusement parks--
Oh, hey, you're not kidding.
Oh, have you guys been to Lincoln Log Land yet?
Oh, man, they have got a roller coaster there, it's made completely out of logs.
It's just like they rode in the pioneer days.
It's unbelievable.
Sir, Jellystone is special.
Okay?
It's turning 100 years old this very year.
Why, it's a landmark.
I would never let it be closed down.
Well, uh, you actually don't have a choice.
Have you read the city bylaws lately?
Chapter 6.
Section 73.
"Any municipal property that can't generate enough money to cover its operating budget can be rezoned for other uses."
And since Jellystone loses money every year, we're shutting it down.
Uh, sorry?
[BOTH CHUCKLE]
-I thought that went well.
CHIEF:
Yeah.
SMITH:
Just a second, Mr. Mayor.
Who says we can't cover our budget?
Park doesn't report earnings till next quarter.
Yeah, which is like one week away.
Come on, Smith.
You gotta be $20,000 in the hole.
We wish.
Yeah.
Try 30,562.
That's probably a couple hundred extra for the map stand.
I think it's confession time.
-I only pretended to fix it.
-Thanks, Jones.
Sounds like you're in pretty deep there, Smith.
Maybe we are.
But this is one of the last places families can go to be close to nature.
The world needs that.
Well, I'm not mayor of the world.
I'm mayor of this city.
And this city needs this park rezoned.
I'm sorry.
I feel awful about it.
Even though I look really good.
This is a new suit.
So, okay.
Maybe we don't have our operating budget today.
But you know what?
-A lot can happen in a week.
-All right.
Have it your way.
Take a week.
Hey, I'll even get you started.
What's the admission fee for one car again?
Four dollars.
Four dollars, huh?
Four whole dollars?
Well, that changes everything.
Oh, my goodness.
Well, I only need to come back in here like, uh, what, 10,000 more times?
[LAUGHING]
In a week!
Do I have time for that?
-Impossible.
-Oh, shoot.
[WEIRD AL YANKOVIC'S "LASAGNA" PLAYING ON STEREO]
You want-a some-a lasagna?
You hungry, buddy?
Of course!
I'm always hungry.
I was talking to my pet turtle.
Here you go.
That better not be my beefjerky.
[TURTLE CHEWING]
[BELCHES]
So, what's the big deal, Yogi?
This is the big deal, Boo Boo.
It's my masterpiece.
The Basket-Nabber 2000.
The most advanced pic-a-nic basket-stealing technology ever invented.
Wow.
Climb aboard.
This glider can steer dive, shoot rubber bands at pesky-type birds and even has an air bag.
Had an air bag.
Sorry, Yogi.
Not to worry.
We could cushion our landing with all the pic-a-nic baskets we swipe.
Now, how's that copilot seat feel?
A little wobbly, like it's not tied on very tight.
You won't feel that in the air.
Get ready to fly faster than the speed of sandwich, Boo Boo.
We're gonna break the pic-a-nic barrier.
SMITH:
Yogi!
-Uh-oh.
That's not his happy voice.
Don't move.
I'm switching the glider into stealth mode.
Stealth mode?
Wow.
How are you able to--?
Oh.
Ah, Mr. Ranger, sir.
Welcome.
Can I interest you in a sody pop?
-There you go.
-When did you steal our vending machine?
I, um-
- I'm repairing it, sir.
This machine gives its sodas away for free when a bear kicks it.
Look, a camper has reported some missing fishing poles so I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say it was you.
Fishing poles?
Sir, I'm a bear.
If I wanted to catch fish, I would just use my....
Your paws, Yogi.
Isn't that kind of unsanitary?
What's that?
-What's what?
-That thing.
-What thing?
-The thing under the blanket.
-Blanket?
-The object right behind you.
Oh.
Oh, that.
Heh.
A sculpture.
I'm sculpting now.
Mostly landscapes.
And where's Boo Boo?
-France.
-What?
-That's not close by, is it?
-No.
Then he's in the bathroom.
-Excuse me.
-Wait!
[STAMMERING]
Hey, this isn't the bathroom.
I'm telling you, Mr. Ranger, it's not for stealing pic-a-nic baskets.
It says "Basket-Nabber 2000" right here, Yogi.
I do regret calling it that now.
I know I'm always saying, "Stay away from the campers."
This is different.
Jellystone is in real trouble.
If I don't raise $30,000 in a week, this park's getting rezoned.
Rezoned?
What does that mean?
It means the park won't be a park anymore.
The city will use this land for something else.
So we have got to do everything we can to help save it.
Which means you have gotta stop stealing food so that campers will leave here happy.
But they do leave here happy.
Getting your food stolen by Yogi Bear is special.
People come here for that.
It's like catching a foul ball at a baseball game.
Nope.
It's like getting your food stolen at a baseball game.
Come on, Yogi.
Would it really be so hard to be a regular bear?
You know, to forage for food, to walk around on all fours to hibernate a little, or a lot.
If nature had meant for me to be a regular bear it wouldn't have given me such a good thought-cooker, sir.
I can't help it if my melon is full of smart juice.
Yogi, your melon is hurting this park.
There are repercussions to stealing people's picnic baskets.
Not in my experience, sir.
[MECHANISM TICKING]
[BELL RINGS]
[GRUNTS]
On the other hand--
[SCREAMS]
Ranger Smith, mind if I borrow the 'dilla?
It's an emergency.
Somebody parked without parking decals.
Jones, I would really prefer it if you focused on just maintaining the park instead.
Let me deal with the visitors until you've had more experience.
Sorry, sir.
Guess that's just the Eagle Scout in me, you know?
Always wanting to be in control, be a leader.
Live up to this fanny pack full of merit badges.
You know that fanny pack is for first aid supplies, right?
A merit badge in first aid is the only supply I need, sir.
Right, but it might not be the only supply a hurt person needs.
You seen Rachel?
Yeah, I saw her.
She was heading up to Lookout Mountain.
She can't be far.
I'll drive.
Let's roll.
Jones.
The sprawling beauty of Jellystone Park.
A timeless stretch of wilderness untouched by man.
Oh.
Ranger Smith.
Wow, heh.
What's with the fancy outfit?
Dress greens.
I always wear dress greens in the evening.
You know, in case there's, you know--
-I don't know how to talk to girls.
-Oh.
Why do you think I spend so much time with animals?
All you have to do is scratch their backside and you've got a friend for life.
Try that with people and all of a sudden you're the weird girl on the bus that nobody wants to sit next to.
Um, uh, listen.
I was wondering, you know, if you were--
I mean, it's getting late and we could, uh-- If you want.
I mean, it's not that-
- You don't-
- It's--
You know, it's not a worry.
Don't worry.
Did you just ask me to dinner?
Yes.
I did.
Heh.
-Good, you got that, huh?
-Yes.
I just thought, well, it's getting late.
I happen to know this great place.
-Very gourmet.
-Really?
Where?
So close you won't believe it.
Wow, how did you ever find this place?
This is a four-star porch.
And fresh from the hot plate, I give you...
-...rack of Spam.
-Oh.
Wow.
Maybe "gourmet" was a bit of a stretch.
No, it actually looks wonderful.
Great.
You know, this really is a peaceful place.
It's something, isn't it?
I pretty much grew up here.
My father was a ranger when I was a kid and he turned this park into the number one tourist destination in the state.
I mean, it was a park, you know?
Like families came by the hundreds swam in the streams, hiked on the trails.
It was really something.
This is really good.
Anyway, I don't know.
Maybe it's my fault.
I spent so many years learning everything I could about the park so I'd be a better ranger.
Maybe instead, I should have come up with a gimmick to get people to come here.
You know, change the name to Extreme Jellystone.
-I think that it's perfect just the way it is.
-You do?
You're right.
Absolutely.
There's no better place on earth.
YOGI:
Hey, Mr. Ranger.
-Except a place without him.
Evening, Mr. Ranger, sir.
Madame Moviemaker Lady.
And yes, I'm using the fancy tense to show you the utmost respect.
Hi.
Ha, ha.
What do you want, Yogi?
Well, I was thinking about the park's prickly predicament and I would like to do my part to help.
This is all the money I have saved.
Almost $100.
I was going to use it on myself, but I'd rather donate it to Jellystone.
Well, thank you, Yogi.
That's--
That is very sweet.
-Where does a bear get money from?
-That brown box by the parking lot.
The park donation box.
Yep.
But I want you to have it.
Consider it a gift to Jellystone.
That won't be hard.
Look, guys, I appreciate the effort.
But what this park needs is visitors and lots of them.
Well, I can help you there, sir.
Just make me a headliner.
I will rock this place.
-Kick it, Boo Boo.
-Kicking it.
[SIR MIX-A-LOT'S "BABY GOT BACK" PLAYING]
I like big butts and I cannot lie You other brothers can't deny
That when a girl walks in With a itty-bitty waist
And a round thing in your face You get sprung
[MUSIC STOPS]
That's not gonna work either, Yogi.
You're right.
We need something flashier than music.
Not a problem.
I've got this water-skiing routine that will change the face of entertainment.
Got a little of everything.
Music, stunts, magic.
-And I jump over Boo Boo at the end.
-No, you don't.
-I want to try it.
-I don't care.
I hate to interrupt, but you're not gonna water-ski or dance or do anything that might disturb the campers, okay?
If what you really want to do is help save this park you will lay low, stay away from people.
Think you can do that for me?
You have my word, Mr. Ranger.
I will be seen, but not heard.
Or seen.
Fine.
Huh?
You guys done with that Spam?
-Get out of here.
-Okay.
Sheesh!
Hey.
What's this?
Seasons pass applications.
Unfortunately, not a lot of takers on those.
Fifty bucks for an entire year?
Including camping fees?
That's a bargain.
If this were a place people wanted to visit throughout the year.
Maybe Yogi was on to something.
-You said the park was turning 100, right?
-Right.
Well, a big event could really pull people in.
Yeah, you're right.
We could have, like, a moss collection day or a big squirrel chase.
-Or....
-Fireworks.
Yes.
Exactly.
Why didn't I think of that?
We could host a big centennial festival.
People always show up for fireworks.
If even half of the people buy season passes the park makes enough money to stay open.
Right.
Let's get the word out.
I think I can help with that.
[PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY]
That is great.
How did we pay for it?
We didn't.
It was some fast-food restaurant but I rearranged the letters right before the plane took off.
[BOTH CHUCKLE]
You're very cool, Rachel Johnson.
You're pretty cool yourself.
I do have my own kind of natural swagger.
[SCREAMS]
Jellystone National Park, 1 00th year anniversary.
There'll be fireworks.
Just stay calm, Jones.
You should be patrolling in the Armadillo making park-impacting decisions, but--
-Hey, 100th year anniversary.
-Thanks.
But you're not there yet.
You still have to follow orders.
Even if those orders make you look like a giant Cheez-It.
Mr. Mayor!
Hi, Mr. Mayor.
Why is it only going halfway down again?
Doesn't make any-
- No!
Oh, okay.
Is it a double tap or do I have to press it--?
-Oh, dang it!
-I got it, sir.
Yeah.
That's exactly what I did.
Let me see one of those fliers.
"Come celebrate Jellystone's 1 00th anniversary with fireworks and fun."
"And receive $1 0 off a season pass"?
He's gonna try to make the budget selling season passes.
[BOTH GROAN]
Yeah, ugh.
It's not a very good idea, in my opinion.
But nobody consulted me, because my job is just to maintain the park which is basically poking trash with a stick.
Yeah.
Yeah, why is a guy with your talent doing this insulting grunt work?
You should be running a park.
Yeah, but Ranger Smith says I have to pay my dues.
-Excuse me?
-What?
-He has to pay his dues?
Ha.
-Ha, ha.
Nobody pays dues anymore.
You gotta be in charge now while you still know everything.
-That's what I've been saying.
-Yeah.
Buddy, if it was up to me, you would be the head ranger of Jellystone already.
-You'd put me in charge?
-ln a second.
Yes.
You know, if this centennial festival didn't work out, I probably could relocate Smith.
You know, uh, maybe you could help me with that.
Make sure it doesn't succeed?
Wait, you mean, like, sabotage it?
No.
Oh, no, no, no.
No, I want you to be head ranger.
It just so happens that the only way to do that is to bring down this festival.
But spend the rest of your life as second-in-command if you like.
That's fine.
It's a perfectly valid life choice.
Well, you just think about it and give me a call, okay?
Here's my card.
So long.
Hey.
Now why is it doing that?
No.
Boy Scouts are loyal, thrifty, kind....
Hey, you're back.
Hey, thanks for getting those fliers out.
Let me tell you, this festival is gonna be huge.
Hey, Ranger Smith, how long do you think until I reach head ranger status?
Oh, no time at all.
I did it in 12 short years.
Ha, okay.
Are you serious?
Just be patient, Jones.
It'll be here before you know it.
This festival's gonna be great!
I can't wait 12 years.
[PEOPLE CHEERING AND LAUGHING]
Seasons pass order forms.
Seasons pass order forms.
Thank you.
Seasons pass order forms, $1 0 off today.
Ah, enjoy.
I can't take it, Boo Boo.
Two days without a tasty treat to eat?
And I have to sit up here while they're having a "happy birthday, Jellystone" party?
[SNIFFING]
And they have doughnuts.
Doughnuts!
BOO BOO [OVER RADIO]:
Yogi, what are you doing?
-Yogi!
-I'm going.
Hey.
Wait.
Don't do it, Yogi.
You promised Mr. Ranger.
You're right.
I'm losing control, Boo Boo.
I don't know who's steering the ship.
Here.
I want you to handcuff me to this tree and not unlock it no matter what I say.
Okay, Yogi.
-Okay, unlock me.
-Huh?
It was a bad idea.
Unlock me.
[GRUNTING]
Unlock me!
[GROWLING]
Okay.
Here you go.
JONES:
Folks, I hate to say this, but there are no spots left.
Forecast called for thunderstorms.
Severe lightning.
I fear for your young ones.
[CAR HORN HONKING]
We're out of fireworks, I'm afraid.
It's just sparklers left.
Oh, no.
You look nice.
Your napkin matches your tie.
I don't need you to kiss up to me.
Got this guy for that.
That's a good point, sir.
You were gonna handle this situation, yet there are quite a few people here.
Sir, I tried.
All last night I spent taking down fliers.
I blocked the entrance with a vehicle to back up traffic.
I hung up "rabid squirrel" signs everywhere.
Those were hand-drawn.
-Nothing is working.
-You need to think of something, don't you?
Or maybe you're just not head ranger material.
Mr. Mayor.
Mayor's yes man.
So glad you could join us.
I saved you a nice spot next to the porta-potties.
Oh, well, thank you.
Well, that's very thoughtful.
You know, I'm just so glad that these festivities are going so well, Smith.
I just hope nothing goes wrong.
[HORN HONKING]
We are gonna pull this off, Jonesy.
I've seen hundreds of people filling out seasons pass order forms.
The weather's great.
The fireworks, ready to go.
Even Yogi's staying out of the way.
Yogi.
[GROANING]
Hey, guys.
Sorry, just wandering around, bored out of my mind.
Bored?
But the 100th anniversary extravaganza's going on.
Yeah, more like 1 00th anniversary lame-aganza.
You know, because it's so lame.
People see fireworks every day in the city.
They thought they'd see something different here.
I knew it.
I should be out there doing my water-ski routine.
I'm a shining star and Ranger Smith is holding me back.
I don't know, Yogi.
Mr. Ranger is usually right about these things.
No, Boo Boo, Ranger Smith is in denial.
I mean, he's lost it, you know?
I saw him a couple days ago.
He was filling his pockets with dirt.
He said he's gonna start moving the park to his apartment piece by piece.
-How big is his apartment?
-There's still time.
I won't be able to do the half-hour artistic program but that was more for me anyway.
These people need the razzle-dazzle.
I don't think we've practiced the razzle-dazzle.
You're not supposed to, Boo Boo.
That's where it gets the razzle.
Yogi, I really don't think we should--
Boo Boo, you've tried to stop my brilliant ideas with common sense a thousand times.
Has it ever worked?
No.
Then let's go, go, go.
What does that taste like?
Unemployment?
-I'm sorry.
-Yeah.
Thanks again for helping with the fireworks.
I don't know where Jones disappeared to.
My pleasure.
You know, um, Rachel, I've been wanting to tell you...
-...well, how much I--
-Ranger--
No, please, let me get through this.
I'm not very good with words.
But I have never felt so gushy.
Ha-ha-ha.
-You know?
-Ranger--
You know what I did?
I went and I wrote a song about you.
It's like this:
[HUMMING]
Oh, no.
[SINGING] I saw you at the station
Had a heart palpitation
My sickness was love And you're the medication
Rachel
-Rachel
-The microphone is on.
smith:
And it comes around again
Rachel, Rachel, Rachel
The microphone is on.
Yes, the mic--
[CLEARS THROAT THEN LAUGHS]
Hi.
Hello and welcome to the 100th anniversary of Jellystone!
[CHEERING]
Thank you.
It is so wonderful to see so many people here today.
I've noticed many of you filling out your seasons pass order forms.
We're more than happy to collect those after the fireworks.
But first, please, sit back, get comfortable and enjoy the show!
-Terrific.
-Mr.
Mayor?
[POISON'S "NOTHIN' BUT A GOOD TIME" PLAYING ON STEREO]
That's not the right music.
I'll take it from here, Mr. Ranger!
Oh, no.
Full speed ahead, Boo Boo.
Okay.
Not bad, eh, Boo Boo?
Looking good, Yogi.
-This cannot be happening.
-Oh, it's happening.
[YOGI STAMMERING]
Hello, Jellystone!
[CROWD CHEERING]
No, don't encourage him!
They love me.
I can do no wrong.
Watch this.
All right, Boo Boo!
Turn up the heat!
Phase two, go.
I'm an unstoppable water-skiing machine.
[LAUGHING]
Ta-da!
Oh, wait.
There's more.
How about if I heat things up?
[SMITH WHIMPERS]
[GROANING]
Don't need nothin' but a good time
And it don't get better than this
Yogi!
Yogi, your cape.
I know.
It is magnificent.
And on fire.
Huh?
Fire!
[GROANING]
-Turn the boat!
-Huh?
-Turn, Boo Boo!
-Hang on, Yogi!
Too much razzle!
[CROWD SCREAMING]
[GASPS]
-Nice one.
-Thanks.
[RACHEL GASPS]
Jump!
[CHUCKLING]
[CHEERING]
[ALL GASP]
[MURMURING]
Let's go.
[SCREAMING AND SHOUTING]
MAN:
Out of my way!
[CHUCKLING]
This could not have gone more perfectly.
Hey, you got a little, uh....
Never mind.
Let's go.
[SIGHS]
[WOOD SNAPPING AND CREAKING]
Mr. Ranger, I thought--
Yogi, that's the problem.
All the thinking.
Hey, you know what would be great?
If you didn't think.
If you could just be a regular bear.
You know, sitting in the woods, minding his own business.
But no, you're different.
You're smart.
And you'd rather spend your days being selfish and destructive while everyone else pays the price.
But I guess it wasn't enough, screwing up my life.
No, this time you had to go and bring down this entire park.
So tell me, Yogi how smart are you now?
Hey, there!
That was quite a show you put on yesterday.
Ha-ha-ha.
I can't wait to see what you do with this.
That's your new assignment.
Evergreen Park.
Oh, I think you're just going to find it delightful.
Oh, and, uh, Ranger Jones is gonna be taking over here.
Ranger Jones?
Well, I have got a press conference to plan.
You see, it turns out I've saved the city.
Don't forget to vote, my friend.
Brown for governor!
Ha-ha-ha.
He's not gonna vote for me, is he?
Uh, no.
You did everything you could.
Doesn't matter.
This park needed a ranger who could make it popular again.
I'm just some guy who knows how old every tree is.
Fat lot of good that did Jellystone.
Face it.
You and I are just two people who care about things that nobody else does and that's why we're alone.
Or maybe that's why we found each other.
Did you ever think of that?
Rachel, you and this park have one thing in common.
You both deserve a better man than me.
I can't believe he's really gone.
Yogi, are you okay?
I'm done being special, Boo Boo.
Ranger Smith was right.
My whole life, I've been different.
But it's done nothing but hurt people.
The world would be better off if I was only as smart as the average bear.
Yogi, what are you doing?
I'm leaving, Boo Boo.
-I am going to forage for food in the wild.
-Huh?
Might even catch some fish.
With my paws.
[SIGHS]
I'm just gonna grab a little something for the road.
Some chips and soda.
And this.
Peach pie.
Any more of that casserole?
Top shelf.
I'll be out there.
Fending for myself.
Foraging for food in the wild.
[METAL CLANKING]
Goodbye, horsepower limiter.
There's a new head ranger in town.
Let's see what you got.
[GRUNTING]
Perfect.
[SOBBING]
I'm sorry, Ranger Smith.
No more food.
No more pic-a-nickers.
How could this get any worse?
[THUNDER BOOMING]
Oh.
Ah, Evergreen Park.
Yes, it is simply delightful.
[GIGGLING]
-Come on.
-I've got it, sir.
This is unbelievable.
Ah, Evergreen Park.
Lovely, isn't it?
This isn't a park.
I can barely breathe in here.
Look at these trees.
They're all plastic.
Oh, no, they're real.
It's just years of smog and pollution have left a plastic-like coating on them.
Think people will be happy you're closing the most beautiful park in the state?
Well, they will be when they find out it's making the city rich and giving each citizen a check for $1000.
How is that even possible?
Oh, well, it turns out that there has been some agricultural interest in the park.
And it's a lot more profitable than people in station wagons making s'mores.
[LAUGHING]
Have a good day, Ranger Smith.
I hate this car. I hate it.
[GRUNTS]
[CHAINSAWS BUZZING]
Yeah!
Oh, hey, there he is.
Ha-ha-ha.
Whoa, hey, Mr. Mayor!
I, uh....
Just finishing some stamping.
You are doing great, Jones.
I knew you were the guy for this job.
Quick thing.
You'll probably notice some giant trucks rumbling by.
We're just clearing a little patch of trees for my press conference.
No big deal.
Um, wait, you're cutting down trees?
Oh, yeah.
Well, just a few.
It's nothing to worry about.
Actually gonna improve the park quite a bit.
I'll bet one of the first things you noticed as head ranger is that you need more clear spaces here, and you are absolutely right.
Now you can host concerts and Boy Scout jamborees.
That's a pretty smart move there, Head Ranger Jones.
I have some other park improvements I want to run by you.
Oh, splendid, yes.
I think I have a few moments to hear those.
Look into the security arrangements for tomorrow.
I don't want any surprises.
I'll hear what Ding-Dong has to say.
What do you got?
I'm hungrier than the average bear.
I wish I could find a bush that tasted like birthday cake.
Gotcha.
[GROANS]
Pretend it's a gummy worm.
Pretend it's a gummy worm.
[GASPS]
Yogi, I've been looking everywhere for you.
Not now, Boo Boo.
I'm busy foraging.
[GROANS]
[SHOUTS]
Come on, Yogi.
Jellystone is in trouble.
We need your help.
Nothing I can do, Boo Boo.
I'm average now.
My brain is out of business.
I wouldn't even be standing if my paws didn't hurt.
Quit feeling sorry for yourself.
You know you're not an average bear.
Hey, hey, Boo Boo.
You're right, I'm not.
I failed at that too.
Hey, come back here.
You've gotta save Jellystone.
YOGI:
What are you doing?
I'm not--
Yogi, you have to use your smarts for good.
And if you can't see that, maybe you are just an average bear.
Come on.
[GRUNTING]
Now do you understand?
What's going on, Boo Boo?
I don't know.
But whatever it is I think they're just getting started.
Boo Boo get my collar.
Nobody is gonna hurt Jellystone.
Where are we going, Yogi?
We can't get Jellystone back alone, Boo Boo.
My thinker is good, but Ranger Smith's is better.
He was going to a place called Evergreen Park.
That's right. ln the city.
The city?
That's a long walk.
Don't be silly, Boo Boo.
I've already got a smarty-smart cheat to keep our feet off the street.
Get ready for it.
Here it comes.
Run, Boo Boo, run!
Hurry, Boo Boo.
I think we gotta jump for it.
Ready?
All aboard.
Good.
Yogi, grab my paw.
[GROANING]
[GRUNTING]
Sorry.
[YOGI SHOUTING]
Boo Boo, Boo Boo, Boo Boo!
I gotta get--!
I guess it makes a stop here.
Yup.
Looks like Evergreen Park is about two miles away from here.
Two miles?
I'll have to tap into my emergency rations.
Snack break.
Come on, Yogi.
We need to keep moving.
It's not that far and it's all downhill.
Downhill?
Excuse me, Mr. Dirty Shopper.
Any chance my friend and I might borrow your wheely-basket?
Is that chocolate?
[YOGI AND BOO BOO LAUGHING]
Okay, Boo Boo, keep it steady.
I'm okay, Ma.
Just--
Yeah, no, it's not Jellystone, but at least there's nothing here to drive me crazy.
-Hey, Mr. Ranger.
-Hey, Yogi.
[CART CRASHES]
All right, Ma, I gotta call you back.
What are you guys doing here?
We need your help, Mr. Ranger, sir.
But don't worry, my days of goofing things up for you are over.
MAN:
Hey, move that shopping cart!
[SHOUTING]
I'm okay!
I'm just gonna put this over here.
What do you want?
I don't have a life left for you to ruin anymore.
Sir, I know I messed things up and I'm sorry.
I never meant to.
You and Boo Boo are the best friends I ever had.
And I've never done anything but think of myself.
And now Jellystone is just gonna be a big field of stumps.
What?
They've started cutting down the trees.
"Agricultural interest" is logging.
Oh, no, not our Jellystone.
We have to save it, sir.
I don't think we can save it, Yogi.
I'm no smarter than you.
I lost Jellystone.
I lost Rachel.
It's over.
Mr. Ranger, I've learned two things from stealing pic-a-nic baskets.
One:
light mayonnaise is not nearly as good as regular mayonnaise.
And two: you can't fail if you never stop trying.
You have to fight for the things you love whether it's a park, a girl or a roast beef sandwich.
Don't give up now.
We're all Jellystone's got.
You're right, Yogi.
Jellystone's too important to give up on.
We gotta try.
Come on.
-Shotgun.
-Aw.
I never thought I'd see this.
Happy 1 00th anniversary, Jellystone.
Isn't that Miss Movie Lady?
RACHEL:
I gotta get in there.
You don't understand.
Let me in, please.
No can do.
Park is closed to the public until the press conference.
Mayor's orders.
Then go talk to him.
Tell him what I told you.
I'm sorry.
I don't really take orders from a--
I lived with gorillas, pal.
I know rage.
You do not want me to go gorilla on you.
[SCREAMS]
Uh, I'll speak to the mayor.
-Thank you.
-Okay.
Rachel.
Ranger Smith.
I didn't think I'd ever see you again.
I know.
I don't know what I was thinking.
I think you're perfect.
I think any guy in the world would be lucky just to stand next to you.
You really mean that?
Of course I do.
It's just, when I lost Jellystone, I felt like such a failure.
But losing you has felt much, much worse.
I'm like....
I'm like a genus without a phylum.
That's the sweetest thing anyone's ever said to me.
-So, um, we're still here.
YOGI:
Mm-hm.
Oh, right.
Ahem.
So, what are you doing here?
-Come on, I'll show you.
-Okay.
I was reviewing the documentary footage from Boo Boo's camera and I saw this.
Oh, my.
I see it.
I have a bald spot back there!
I'm not talking about you, Yogi.
I'm talking about this.
Yeah, it's my pet turtle.
He hangs out at the cave all the time.
True.
You know they don't come out of that shell?
I tried one time to see what one would look like without it.
But, nope, they're sewn in.
This is no regular turtle.
See the bulging frog-like eyes and the really wide mouth?
A frog-mouthed turtle?
Yup, Rafetus swinhoei.
smith:
But those are extinct.
For a hundred years, but apparently one still exists.
And he lives in there.
But they won't let me through the gates to go find him.
But if Jellystone has an endangered species living in it, then--
It has to be protected as a park.
That's the law.
That turtle can save this park.
Now I feel kinda bad about using him as a foot stool.
CHIEF:
You've seen the filmmaker?
Well, we spoke.
About extinct turtles.
You're telling me there is an extinct turtle living here in the park?
According to Miss Johnson's film, there is.
An extinct turtle?
That's great.
Visitors will come from miles around to see an endangered species.
Yes, they will, and that is great.
We need to find this turtle.
Just to keep it safe.
Have a vet check it out.
The whole deal.
The sooner we get to him the better.
Oh, we need a head ranger who's good enough to find it.
Someone who thinks like a turtle.
I am that head ranger.
Well, then why are you still here?
He's back.
Come on.
You need to let us in this park.
That turtle needs protection.
Don't worry about the turtle.
We're handling it.
We'll make sure he's put in a nice zoo.
No.
A turtle that's endangered can't be removed from its natural habitat.
It's against federal law.
It is?
Wow, I've never heard of that law in chapter 4, subsection 6 of the Wildlife Protection Mandate.
Don't worry, Mr. Ranger, sir.
That turtle is safe.
These people have no idea where my cave is.
The turtle's in the talking bear's cave.
JONES [OVER RADIO]:
Copy.
Wow, that backfired.
Okay.
You know what?
Fine,
You win.
What are you doing?
I have a plan.
One of the advantages of having lived here since I was a kid is I know this park like the back of my hand.
Let's go!
Hold on, boys.
All right.
Hey, there, little buddy.
Hello, there.
Uh-oh.
Sorry about that.
-Mayor Brown.
-This had better be good, Jones.
JONES:
I found the turtle.
He was in Boo Boo's sleeping bag.
But now I have him secure at the picnic area.
Jones, you're a hero.
Sit tight.
My chief of staff is on his way to get him.
Copy that.
Head Ranger Jones over and out.
smith:
He found the turtle.
Dang it.
Can't cross those rapids.
There's no way to get to him from here.
Well, there is one way.
There it is.
My masterpiece.
-You really think you can pull this off?
-I know I can, sir.
I'm gonna snatch that basket-type turtle box and fly away like a fuzzy bird.
And I've got the best copilot a basket-snatching machine could have.
-I don't know how to fly this thing.
-Well, you'll pick it up as we go.
smith:
Okay.
Look, just be careful, okay, Yogi?
Copy that, ground control.
Basket-Nabber 2000 ready for takeoff.
-Flight systems check.
Boo Boo?
-What?
-Can you reach the pedals?
-If I point my toes.
Flight systems are go.
Remember what I told you about flying gliders, Yogi.
Don't fight the wind.
As long as the wind wants me to snatch up that turtle, we'll get along just fine.
-All right.
YOGI:
Start pedaling, Boo Boo.
All right.
Here goes.
YOGI:
Hold on, Boo Boo.
Fasten your seat belt.
But there isn't one.
YOGI:
Here we go!
BOO BOO:
Oh, Yogi!
The wind should carry you south!
We'll meet you there!
Take your time, Mr. Ranger.
This machine is equipped with landing gear.
We'll touch down as soft as a feather.
Whoops.
This is your captain speaking.
We'll reach our turtle target in about two minutes.
So let's go ahead and start the beverage service.
-Yogi, look out.
-Aah!
-Trees!
-Yes, trees!
[BOTH SCREAMING]
I got it.
I got it.
I got it.
I don't got it!
BOO BOO:
Pull up.
-Hey!
-Pull up!
You did it, Yogi.
Oh.
Yeah.
Ha-ha-ha.
Great job, Jones.
I'll get this guy to the city zoo.
-The city zoo?
-Yep.
They got a nice spot ready in the reptile house.
The city zoo doesn't have a reptile house.
They're building one.
-Who is?
-Builders.
Sure you're trying to protect the turtle?
Yeah, we love turtles.
Then you won't mind if I hold onto him until I notify the Wildlife Federation, right?
All right.
You're gonna find this out in a few hours anyway, so I might as well tell you.
We gotta lose this turtle to sell logging rights to the park.
Logging?
The whole park?
Yeah, but who cares?
It's still a park, just without trees.
And they'll grow back.
Yeah, in like 200 years.
It doesn't matter.
Your career is what matters.
Ha-ha-ha.
Turtle target acquired.
I need 20 more feet of altitude.
Engage the hand pedals.
You couldn't put the hand pedals by you?
There's a suggestion box behind the seat, Boo Boo.
[GROANS]
Wait, you don't want to approach him like that.
He's poisonous.
He's in a basket.
But he can spit.
Poison.
He'll aim at your eyes.
Melt them out of your head.
-l'm telling you, that turtle is deadly.
-What are you looking at?
-Hook me in, Boo Boo.
-Okay.
And fire!
Here you go.
Huh?
Yogi, wait!
Here I come!
He's going for the turtle.
-Mind if I borrow this?
-Hey!
[YOGI LAUGHS]
Look, Boo Boo!
We got the turtle!
Hey, why aren't you in your seat?
That bear knows how to steal a basket.
Everybody after that glider now!
I'm not gonna let a bear make me look bad.
Been there, buddy.
We're drifting too far right.
I wanna get us outside the park.
Don't fight the wind, Yogi.
Remember what Miss Movie Lady said about--
Never mind.
YOGI:
Hang on, Boo Boo.
-What do we do now?
Did you check the safety manual?
It's just a picture of us screaming.
[BOTH SCREAMING]
We've got to deject, Boo.
Don't you mean eject?
Eject is up.
Deject is down.
In case of emergency your seat can also be used as a flotation device!
[YOGI LAUGHING]
[GRUNTING]
Hey, told you.
Nothing to worry about.
I actually think I wasn't worried enough.
Let me see how our little passenger is doing.
Wonder why they call him a frog-mouthed turtle anyway?
Hey!
SMITH:
Hey, guys, over here!
Yogi, grab the branch.
Got you, Mr. Ranger, sir.
[SMITH AND RACHEL GRUNT]
-Welcome aboard.
SMITH:
Yogi.
We were trying to get you off the raft.
Yeah, that makes more sense.
You guys did it.
You saved him.
[CAR HORN HONKS]
Oh, no.
They're gonna catch us downstream.
I'm on it.
No, Yogi, don't.
Problem solved.
They can't catch us now.
Yeah, because now we are headed straight for the Jellyjarring Rapids.
[GRUNTS]
-Grab a paddle.
-Tuck your head in, little buddy.
Brace yourselves.
Oh, come on, turtle.
Don't worry, I put safety belts in this raft for just such an occasion.
You better hang on.
Mr. Ranger said--
YOGI:
We're gonna be fine, Boo Boo.
Just sit back and let Mother Nature carry us to--
[ALL SCREAMING]
I think Mother Nature's kind of cranky today.
You okay, Yogi?
Fine!
Turtle!
YOGI:
Who's that?
I can't see.
Come here, turtle.
-Got him.
SMITH:
Good work, Boo Boo.
We made it through the rapids.
Yeah, but that means the falls are just up ahead.
Hold on!
[SCREAMING]
Yogi.
Yogi.
Now who says there are no rides at Jellystone?
Yeah, you've definitely got the thrill part down.
ANNOUNCER:
Please, take your seats.
The press conference is about to begin.
That's over a mile away.
We're never gonna make that in time.
[ALL GASP]
-Ranger Jones?
-I messed up pretty bad, sir.
-I know.
It's okay.
-I wanted to be head ranger.
Because you're a good head ranger and I value leadership.
I have a merit badge--
Can we talk later?
We're pressed for time.
Yes.
Get in.
[SIREN WAILING]
YOGI:
Boo Boo!
Boo Boo!
Wait up!
smith:
Well, well.
Guess who we found.
Starts with T and ends with a-- "Urtle"?
It's over.
Call off the logging.
The law says this park is now a protected nature preserve.
You think I care about what the law says?
Or about some endangered "frog-mouthed turtle"?
Or some stupid park for families to have a picnic in?
I care about power, you pinheads!
And I'm gonna get it.
Nobody knows this turtle exists.
And nobody ever will.
You found the turtle.
Get this thing out of here before anybody else sees it.
-Rachel!
-Oh!
Yogi!
BOO BOO:
Yogi, here!
Thank you.
-Yogi.
-I'm sorry.
He was open.
Ha, ha.
Now if you'll excuse me, I have a press conference.
I can still tell them what you did.
Oh, yeah?
Without that turtle or a scrap of evidence, go right ahead.
Well, you might as well tell them Bigfoot is here.
Ha-ha-ha.
And do yourself a favor, there, ranger.
Try to keep your dignity.
It's all you have left.
You know what?
I'm taking care of this thing myself this time.
That's the only way to make sure the job is done right.
But that's why I'm the mayor's right-hand man, right?
Because I don't make mistakes.
Hey, you know, people are wondering:
"Why should I vote for Mayor Brown to be governor?"
Well, how about this:
Mayor Brown just turned the city's budget from a deficit into a surplus!
And put $1000 into the pocket of every citizen of this city!
Now before I sign the paperwork that will save the city why don't you all take a look at my first campaign ad for governor?
ANNOUNCER:
Mayor Brown, the right choice for governor.
We're out of time.
Must be something we can do.
Anybody have any ideas?
Well, I guess this is going to be a pretty sad documentary, huh?
Are you--?
Is he still filming?
I needed more footage, so I told him to keep it rolling.
I can plug that into the video feed right up there.
I just need a way to distract the guards.
I think we can take care of that.
ANNOUNCER:
He supports public safety.
[JOURNEY'S "DON'T STOP BELIEVING" PLAYING ON TV]
All right, hurry up, people.
Focus.
Let's go save those orphans.
YOGI:
Hey, hey, hey, check this out!
-Kick it, Boo Boo.
-Kicking it.
Don't stop believing
[LAUGHING]
Hold on to that feeling
ANNOUNCER:
He's tough on crime.
[SHOUTS]
Hey, hey, hey, look at this.
Keep your eye on the little bear.
Look at the skills.
Amazing!
[GRUNTING]
ANNOUNCER:
And here's what Mayor Brown proudly has to say about protecting our natural resources.
[MUSIC STOPS]
You think I care about what the law says?
Or about some endangered "frog-mouthed turtle"?
-Some stupid park for families to picnic in?
-No.
No.
No.
I care about power, you pinheads!
Oh, boy.
Nobody knows this turtle exists.
And nobody ever will.
[BOOING AND JEERING]
[LAUGHING]
There's about to be a riot out there.
I need you out front.
[GRUNTS]
Okay.
No.
Hey, wait.
Wait, wait, wait.
Please, please, please.
That was not real.
Trust me, there is no such thing as a frog-mouthed turtle.
He's right next to me, isn't he?
Okay.
-We did it, Yogi!
-Up high, Boo Boo!
-All right!
JONES:
We got it!
Yogi!
All right, and now....
Miss Moviemaker Lady.
smith:
Hey, we did it.
[LAUGHING]
Hey, Mr. Ranger!
RACHEL:
Come on, Boo Boo.
-Okay.
I was wrong, Yogi.
I say from here on, we just be proud of who we are and fight for the things we're passionate about, like this park.
And Rachel.
And pic-a-nic baskets?
And pic-a-nic baskets.
-Aw, come here!
-No, you don't have to--
Okay.
All right, that's--
I'm good.
[CROWD CHATTERING]
RACHEL:
Here you go, Boo Boo.
Take good care of him.
Hey, there, buddy.
No, no, no, I never took a kickback on anything in my entire career.
No one loves turtles more than I do.
And nature in general.
I love trees.
Oh, no, you don't!
[GROWLS]
Gorilla?
Himalayan snow leopard.
Huh.
Welcome to Jellystone, home of the frog-mouthed turtle.
And brochures.
I'm Ranger Jones.
NARRATOR:
Ah, yes, Jellystone Park.
A wonderful little piece of paradise.
Where families come and soak up the tranquility of nature.
It's a place that--
[MACHINE WHIRRING]
Huh?
Never mind.
MAN:
Hey, hey, hey!
[CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY]
Hi.
Welcome.
Well, I am certainly glad that you are gonna be staying in Jellystone for a while.
And what animal will you be observing?
Well, I thought I would observe the courting rituals of the American ranger.
I happen to hear the American ranger is a very charming intelligent, attractive species.
One that always keeps his cool.
Even when basket-stealing bears push his buttons?
Listen, Yogi will be Yogi.
And I'm just not gonna let it bother me anymore.
Besides I have more important things to focus on.
Oh....
[LAUGHING]
I....
Let's-
- Let's try that again.
[HORN HONKING]
[GASPING]
Afternoon, Mr. Ranger, sir!
Hi, Miss Movie Lady!
[BARKING]
Yogi!
I love this place.
SMITH:
Yogi!
Hey!
[English
- US
- SDH]
NARRATOR:
Jellystone Park.
One of the nation's oldest and most beautiful stretches of wilderness.
For years, families have headed out from the busy city eager to enjoy a little camping, fishing and, of course, observing the park's natural wildlife.
Boo Boo, I think it's time I introduced myself to that pic-a-nic basket.
You know, Yogi, we could just hunt for food.
All the other animals do.
Boo Boo, a pic-a-nic basket has everything a bear needs.
And I'm not just talking about the treats and snack-type goodies.
No.
A pic-a-nic basket holds a lot more than that.
It holds dreams.
[WHISPERING] What are we looking at?
I don't know.
Hook me in.
[IN NORMAL VOICE] You sure it'll work, Yogi?
Well, you know, Boo Boo, I'm smarter than the average bear!
[SHOUTING]
[CHUCKLING]
All right!
[GASPS]
[SHOUTING]
[GRUNTS]
[CHUCKLING]
[GROANS]
MAN:
Ranger Smith!
Sorry about that.
We got a 4-23 in Redwood Valley, sir.
- A what?
- A bear disturbance.
- I think it's probably...
- I know who it is.
Why didn't you just say "bear disturbance"?
Well, I...
Uh, well, it sounds cooler.
I mean, we're park rangers, sir.
You know:
"To protect and preserve."
Did you just make that motto up?
Yeah, I did.
Do you like it?
Ranger Jones, you know that, well, being a park ranger, it's not about mottos.
It's about keeping the park safe.
That's where the glory is.
Protecting all of this.
Yeah, I know.
Besides, that motto was still in the testing phase.
It's not like I made T-shirts or anything.
Heh, no, of course not.
Okay, I'm gonna deal with that 4-23.
Okay, copy that, sir.
Um, I'm actually gonna hop in the Armadillo, make some rounds.
Jones, you know that the Armadillo is for head ranger use only.
I might need it at any moment to deal with a park emergency.
Why don't you finish stacking those trail maps?
Yeah, sure.
Okay.
Yeah, because that's what future head rangers do, they stack maps.
Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy!
Our days of getting banged up to grab a meal are over, Boo Boo.
From now on, the pic-a-nic baskets are going to fall into our arms.
Soldering iron.
BOO BOO:
Here you go.
- Thank you.
Okay.
That should do it.
Test rock.
Okay, Yogi.
YOGI:
Weight sensor triggered.
Basket in position.
Launch spring starts coiling.
Firing pin drops.
And...
[BELL RINGS]
Bull's-eye!
I'm so smart it hurts!
You're standing on the soldering iron.
Or it's that.
[SHOUTING]
Hot, hot, hot!
There's the test rock.
Now we just wait here for a pic-a-nic basket to fall into our arms.
Are you sure about this, Yogi?
People seem to get pretty mad when you...
A genius never questions his instincts, Boo Boo.
When you have a mind like mine you can't blink or you'll put a kink in your think.
Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.
We've got our first customers.
And they have pie!
I wonder what kind it is.
SMITH:
Yogi, are you out here?
- It's Mr. Ranger.
- Aah!
Get rid of the test rock.
Destroy the evidence.
I was never here.
SMITH:
Look...
Ow!
Hello, Mr. Ranger, sir.
Did you just...?
Did you guys...?
Did you...?
Oh, never mind.
Look, there was a complaint about a bear interfering with a family picnic.
I see.
And you'd like us to mount some sort of investigation?
No, I think it was you.
What?
!
How can you even think that?
Are you feverish?
Let me press my lips against your forehead.
Wait!
You're not pressing your lips against my forehead.
Hey, it's a lot better than the way they take my temperature.
[CHUCKLES]
No, look, Yogi, we've been over this many times.
Bears are supposed to avoid people, not run around stealing their food.
I agree, sir.
That's why my friend Boo Boo and I would never think of disturbing a family's pic-a-nic.
[BELL RINGS AND WOOD CLUNKS]
[WOMAN SCREAMS]
Huh.
It missed.
[GROANS]
Good day, Mr. Ranger, sir.
We'll keep our eyes peeled.
I wonder if he noticed the pie.
JONES [CHOPPY OVER RADIO]:
Ra...
Smith.
You have a vis...
Over.
Didn't understand a word of that, Jones.
- Sorry.
Some lady's here to see you.
- Send her in.
- Okay.
I'll be in the Armadillo.
- Or you could be...
- Map stacking?
- Map stacking.
- Ranger Smith?
- Yes.
- Hello.
I'm Rachel Johnson.
- Hi.
I was hoping to talk to you about filming a documentary here.
Sure.
I can handle you for that.
Handle that for you.
Sorry.
My work isn't...
My brain isn't working right.
- I must have inhaled some jimsonweed.
- Oh.
Datura stramonium.
It's known to cause delirium cramping and nausea.
Heh.
- Cramping and nausea.
You've read The North American Wilderness Guide.
Yeah, I like to highlight all the plants and animals I see.
- I like to...
Me too.
- Ha, ha!
Yeah.
[SMITH STAMMERING]
Ranger Smith.
At your service.
You want to film a documentary in Jellystone?
Yes.
I sent you a letter about a month ago.
- Written on a piece of bark.
- That was you!
Yes.
I'm sorry about that.
I was in Sumatra, living among the orangutans at the time and they get very nervous if they spot anything from the modern world.
Really?
Wow, that's amazing.
Then what did you use for ink?
Bird poop and spit.
Impressive.
So, what are you here to film?
Well, I was hoping to shoot a local species.
Something to really capture the beauty of a national park.
Terrific.
What animal were you thinking?
I heard you had an unusual brown bear.
- Brown bear?
- Yes.
One that talks?
Those are so rare.
- None that I can think of.
- Named Yogi?
Wears a hat and a tie?
No, that doesn't ring a bell.
I think he's standing on the roof, trying to steal your lunchbox.
YOGI:
I smell PB and J.
[YOGI SHOUTING]
I'm all done.
Oh, right.
That Yogi.
Bankrupt?
No, no, no.
We're a city.
Cities don't go bankrupt.
They do when they're broke, sir.
We just have to find some money somewhere.
I'm about to run for governor.
How am I gonna do that when my own city is bankrupt?
Okay, yes.
Thank you.
- Here's the invoice, Mr. Mayor.
- Yikes!
Wow.
Ha.
I'm gonna pretend I didn't see that.
Just bill it to the city, okay?
Thank you.
Ugh.
How did we ever go so broke?
- I think we just spent too much.
- Hmm.
Is there anything we can sell?
You already sold the public golf course to condo developers two of the three fire stations to that frozen yogurt company.
You were selling the library, but it burned down.
Oh, yeah.
That was gonna be one of those make-your-own-doughnut places.
- No.
- Yeah.
- If you could dream it up, you could make it.
- Ah.
Love those.
We gotta think of something here.
Well, if we don't have anything to sell, maybe we can profit off what we can't sell.
I don't understand those words.
Like when we sold the bottling rights to the water in Lake Beuclair.
- We made a fortune.
- Yeah.
Sinkhole Beuclair is a great place to throw old mattresses.
- Oh, yeah.
- Hmm.
We just don't have any more resources to exploit.
Or do we?
Jellystone.
If we rezone Jellystone Park as agricultural land, we can sell the logging rights.
Here.
This company says they'll give us thousands of dollars an acre just to cut down the trees or something.
That'll be enough to balance the budget and give each citizen a big fat check.
[LAUGHING]
You have any idea how many votes that'll buy me?
- Enough to be the next governor?
- Exactly.
You're fine, Yogi.
It's just a few scrapes and bruises.
I don't know, Mr. Ranger.
I'm pretty sure I heard my spine snap.
Well, you wouldn't be able to stand.
And you wouldn't be able to eat.
I'm okay!
Yogi, Boo Boo, I would like to introduce you to Rachel Johnson who's here to make a nature documentary.
[GROWLS]
What the heck was that?
I was saying hello.
I lived in a den with brown bears for six months.
Only bear I've ever lived with is Boo Boo.
And he only makes that sound after he's eaten baked beans.
Heh, heh.
I have problems with baked beans.
And for a little bear, he makes a lot of stink.
Okay, I have some fantastic river otters you can film instead.
- Could get a hat and tie on the slow one.
- No, you know, I really, really like these two.
- Would you guys mind if I shoot you?
YOGI:
Huh?
[RAPID FOOTSTEPS]
Yogi, I think she meant with a camera.
Yes.
Of course with a camera.
Heh-heh-heh.
I knew that.
But not just any camera.
This isn't gonna make me look fat, is it?
RACHEL:
No, you are gonna look great.
Okay, just a few more adjustments.
[WHISPERING] Please, excuse the pre-tied bow tie.
My mornings are often rushed.
It's fine, Boo Boo.
This is going to be a whole new perspective for a documentary.
The Boo Boo cam will capture the true wilderness in all its natural glory.
No other human in sight.
That sounds like my apartment.
Ha, ha.
Uh, you know, because I live alone.
Well, plenty of women have tried to change that.
It's just, I haven't found one that...
- Likes you?
- What?
No.
No, that...
Will return your calls?
Can you stop helping, please?
Sir, I can see you like this lady.
But your courting rituals need work.
What you need to do is follow her around for two days making snorting sounds.
Then fight any male that looks at her.
And then, of course, urinate on her to mark her as your territory.
Works every time.
I got it under control, Yogi.
- Boo Boo, you're rolling.
- Cool.
Yogi Bear, a brown bear commonly found in North America and Alaska.
Weighing up to 1800 pounds, brown bears are also the national animal of Finland.
I don't think you have to narrate.
But I liked where you were going with it, Boo Boo.
- I was hooked.
- Really?
Yes.
Now try to film from flattering angles, if you know what I mean.
Pic-a-nic baskets may be delicious on the lips, but they're a lifetime on the hips.
Oh, no.
Ranger Smith!
Ranger Smith.
The mayor's here.
What's he doing here?
Why didn't he give us more warning?
I have to secure the area.
All units, lock down the park.
Repeat, lock down the park.
Jones, you know I'm the only other ranger here, right?
Yeah.
- Ranger Smith, we need to talk.
- You could've just called.
BROWN:
Yeah, but I thought this would be more friendly.
I'm really working on my people skills.
Anyway, I am closing your park down.
- Okay.
- What?
Oh, yeah, this place just costs the city way too much money.
Jellystone hasn't made its operating budget in 10 years.
You know, it's hard to compete with all those amusement parks...
Oh, hey, you're not kidding.
Oh, have you guys been to Lincoln Log Land yet?
Oh, man, they have got a roller coaster there, it's made completely out of logs.
It's just like they rode in the pioneer days.
It's unbelievable.
Sir, Jellystone is special.
Okay?
It's turning 100 years old this very year.
Why, it's a landmark.
I would never let it be closed down.
Well, uh, you actually don't have a choice.
Have you read the city bylaws lately?
Chapter 6.
Section 73.
"Any municipal property that can't generate enough money to cover its operating budget can be rezoned for other uses."
And since Jellystone loses money every year, we're shutting it down.
Uh, sorry?
[BOTH CHUCKLE]
- I thought that went well.
CHIEF:
Yeah.
SMITH:
Just a second, Mr. Mayor.
Who says we can't cover our budget?
Park doesn't report earnings till next quarter.
Yeah, which is like one week away.
Come on, Smith.
You gotta be $20,000 in the hole.
We wish.
Yeah.
Try 30,562.
That's probably a couple hundred extra for the map stand.
I think it's confession time.
- I only pretended to fix it.
- Thanks, Jones.
Sounds like you're in pretty deep there, Smith.
Maybe we are.
But this is one of the last places families can go to be close to nature.
The world needs that.
Well, I'm not mayor of the world.
I'm mayor of this city.
And this city needs this park rezoned.
I'm sorry.
I feel awful about it.
Even though I look really good.
This is a new suit.
So, okay.
Maybe we don't have our operating budget today.
But you know what?
- A lot can happen in a week.
- All right.
Have it your way.
Take a week.
Hey, I'll even get you started.
What's the admission fee for one car again?
Four dollars.
Four dollars, huh?
Four whole dollars?
Well, that changes everything.
Oh, my goodness.
Well, I only need to come back in here like, uh, what, 10,000 more times?
[LAUGHING]
In a week!
Do I have time for that?
- Impossible.
- Oh, shoot.
[WEIRD AL YANKOVIC'S "LASAGNA" PLAYING ON STEREO]
You want-a some-a lasagna?
You hungry, buddy?
Of course!
I'm always hungry.
I was talking to my pet turtle.
Here you go.
That better not be my beef jerky.
[TURTLE CHEWING]
[BELCHES]
So, what's the big deal, Yogi?
This is the big deal, Boo Boo.
It's my masterpiece.
The Basket-Nabber 2000.
The most advanced pic-a-nic basket-stealing technology ever invented.
Wow.
Climb aboard.
This glider can steer dive, shoot rubber bands at pesky-type birds and even has an air bag.
Had an air bag.
Sorry, Yogi.
Not to worry.
We could cushion our landing with all the pic-a-nic baskets we swipe.
Now, how's that copilot seat feel?
A little wobbly, like it's not tied on very tight.
You won't feel that in the air.
Get ready to fly faster than the speed of sandwich, Boo Boo.
We're gonna break the pic-a-nic barrier.
SMITH:
Yogi!
- Uh-oh.
That's not his happy voice.
Don't move.
I'm switching the glider into stealth mode.
Stealth mode?
Wow.
How are you able to...?
Oh.
Ah, Mr. Ranger, sir.
Welcome.
Can I interest you in a sody pop?
- There you go.
- When did you steal our vending machine?
I, um...
I'm repairing it, sir.
This machine gives its sodas away for free when a bear kicks it.
Look, a camper has reported some missing fishing poles so I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say it was you.
Fishing poles?
Sir, I'm a bear.
If I wanted to catch fish, I would just use my...
Your paws, Yogi.
Isn't that kind of unsanitary?
What's that?
- What's what?
- That thing.
- What thing?
- The thing under the blanket.
- Blanket?
- The object right behind you.
Oh.
Oh, that.
Heh.
A sculpture.
I'm sculpting now.
Mostly landscapes.
And where's Boo Boo?
- France.
- What?
- That's not close by, is it?
- No.
Then he's in the bathroom.
- Excuse me.
- Wait!
[STAMMERING]
Hey, this isn't the bathroom.
I'm telling you, Mr. Ranger, it's not for stealing pic-a-nic baskets.
It says "Basket-Nabber 2000" right here, Yogi.
I do regret calling it that now.
I know I'm always saying, "Stay away from the campers."
This is different.
Jellystone is in real trouble.
If I don't raise $30,000 in a week, this park's getting rezoned.
Rezoned?
What does that mean?
It means the park won't be a park anymore.
The city will use this land for something else.
So we have got to do everything we can to help save it.
Which means you have gotta stop stealing food so that campers will leave here happy.
But they do leave here happy.
Getting your food stolen by Yogi Bear is special.
People come here for that.
It's like catching a foul ball at a baseball game.
Nope.
It's like getting your food stolen at a baseball game.
Come on, Yogi.
Would it really be so hard to be a regular bear?
You know, to forage for food, to walk around on all fours to hibernate a little, or a lot.
If nature had meant for me to be a regular bear it wouldn't have given me such a good thought-cooker, sir.
I can't help it if my melon is full of smart juice.
Yogi, your melon is hurting this park.
There are repercussions to stealing people's picnic baskets.
Not in my experience, sir.
[MECHANISM TICKING]
[BELL RINGS]
[GRUNTS]
On the other hand...
[SCREAMS]
Ranger Smith, mind if I borrow the 'dilla?
It's an emergency.
Somebody parked without parking decals.
Jones, I would really prefer it if you focused on just maintaining the park instead.
Let me deal with the visitors until you've had more experience.
Sorry, sir.
Guess that's just the Eagle Scout in me, you know?
Always wanting to be in control, be a leader.
Live up to this fanny pack full of merit badges.
You know that fanny pack is for first aid supplies, right?
A merit badge in first aid is the only supply I need, sir.
Right, but it might not be the only supply a hurt person needs.
You seen Rachel?
Yeah, I saw her.
She was heading up to Lookout Mountain.
She can't be far.
I'll drive.
Let's roll.
Jones.
The sprawling beauty of Jellystone Park.
A timeless stretch of wilderness untouched by man.
Oh.
Ranger Smith.
Wow, heh.
What's with the fancy outfit?
Dress greens.
I always wear dress greens in the evening.
You know, in case there's, you know...
- I don't know how to talk to girls.
- Oh.
Why do you think I spend so much time with animals?
All you have to do is scratch their backside and you've got a friend for life.
Try that with people and all of a sudden you're the weird girl on the bus that nobody wants to sit next to.
Um, uh, listen.
I was wondering, you know, if you were...
I mean, it's getting late and we could, uh...
If you want.
I mean, it's not that...
You don't...
It's...
You know, it's not a worry.
Don't worry.
Did you just ask me to dinner?
Yes.
I did.
Heh.
- Good, you got that, huh?
- Yes.
I just thought, well, it's getting late.
I happen to know this great place.
- Very gourmet.
- Really?
Where?
So close you won't believe it.
Wow, how did you ever find this place?
This is a four-star porch.
And fresh from the hot plate, I give you rack of Spam.
- Oh.
Wow.
Maybe "gourmet" was a bit of a stretch.
No, it actually looks wonderful.
Great.
You know, this really is a peaceful place.
It's something, isn't it?
I pretty much grew up here.
My father was a ranger when I was a kid and he turned this park into the number one tourist destination in the state.
I mean, it was a park, you know?
Like families came by the hundreds swam in the streams, hiked on the trails.
It was really something.
This is really good.
Anyway, I don't know.
Maybe it's my fault.
I spent so many years learning everything I could about the park so I'd be a better ranger.
Maybe instead, I should have come up with a gimmick to get people to come here.
You know, change the name to Extreme Jellystone.
- I think that it's perfect just the way it is.
- You do?
You're right.
Absolutely.
There's no better place on earth.
YOGI:
Hey, Mr. Ranger.
- Except a place without him.
Evening, Mr. Ranger, sir.
Madame Moviemaker Lady.
And yes, I'm using the fancy tense to show you the utmost respect.
Hi.
Ha, ha.
What do you want, Yogi?
Well, I was thinking about the park's prickly predicament and I would like to do my part to help.
This is all the money I have saved.
Almost $100.
I was going to use it on myself, but I'd rather donate it to Jellystone.
Well, thank you, Yogi.
That's...
That is very sweet.
- Where does a bear get money from?
- That brown box by the parking lot.
The park donation box.
Yep.
But I want you to have it.
Consider it a gift to Jellystone.
That won't be hard.
Look, guys, I appreciate the effort.
But what this park needs is visitors and lots of them.
Well, I can help you there, sir.
Just make me a headliner.
I will rock this place.
- Kick it, Boo Boo.
- Kicking it.
[SIR MIX-A-LOT'S "BABY GOT BACK" PLAYING]
I like big butts and I cannot lie You other brothers can't deny
That when a girl walks in With a itty-bitty waist
And a round thing in your face You get sprung
[MUSIC STOPS]
That's not gonna work either, Yogi.
You're right.
We need something flashier than music.
Not a problem.
I've got this water-skiing routine that will change the face of entertainment.
Got a little of everything.
Music, stunts, magic.
- And I jump over Boo Boo at the end.
- No, you don't.
- I want to try it.
- I don't care.
I hate to interrupt, but you're not gonna water-ski or dance or do anything that might disturb the campers, okay?
If what you really want to do is help save this park you will lay low, stay away from people.
Think you can do that for me?
You have my word, Mr. Ranger.
I will be seen, but not heard.
Or seen.
Fine.
Huh?
You guys done with that Spam?
- Get out of here.
- Okay.
Sheesh!
Hey.
What's this?
Seasons pass applications.
Unfortunately, not a lot of takers on those.
Fifty bucks for an entire year?
Including camping fees?
That's a bargain.
If this were a place people wanted to visit throughout the year.
Maybe Yogi was on to something.
- You said the park was turning 100, right?
- Right.
Well, a big event could really pull people in.
Yeah, you're right.
We could have, like, a moss collection day or a big squirrel chase.
- Or...
- Fireworks.
Yes.
Exactly.
Why didn't I think of that?
We could host a big centennial festival.
People always show up for fireworks.
If even half of the people buy season passes the park makes enough money to stay open.
Right.
Let's get the word out.
I think I can help with that.
[PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY]
That is great.
How did we pay for it?
We didn't.
It was some fast-food restaurant but I rearranged the letters right before the plane took off.
[BOTH CHUCKLE]
You're very cool, Rachel Johnson.
You're pretty cool yourself.
I do have my own kind of natural swagger.
[SCREAMS]
Jellystone National Park, 100th year anniversary.
There'll be fireworks.
Just stay calm, Jones.
You should be patrolling in the Armadillo making park-impacting decisions, but...
- Hey, 100th year anniversary.
- Thanks.
But you're not there yet.
You still have to follow orders.
Even if those orders make you look like a giant Cheez-It.
Mr. Mayor!
Hi, Mr. Mayor.
Why is it only going halfway down again?
Doesn't make any...
No!
Oh, okay.
Is it a double tap or do I have to press it...?
- Oh, dang it!
- I got it, sir.
Yeah.
That's exactly what I did.
Let me see one of those fliers.
"Come celebrate Jellystone's 100th anniversary with fireworks and fun."
"And receive $10 off a season pass"?
He's gonna try to make the budget selling season passes.
[BOTH GROAN]
Yeah, ugh.
It's not a very good idea, in my opinion.
But nobody consulted me, because my job is just to maintain the park which is basically poking trash with a stick.
Yeah.
Yeah, why is a guy with your talent doing this insulting grunt work?
You should be running a park.
Yeah, but Ranger Smith says I have to pay my dues.
- Excuse me?
- What?
- He has to pay his dues?
Ha.
- Ha, ha.
Nobody pays dues anymore.
You gotta be in charge now while you still know everything.
- That's what I've been saying.
- Yeah.
Buddy, if it was up to me, you would be the head ranger of Jellystone already.
- You'd put me in charge?
- In a second.
Yes.
You know, if this centennial festival didn't work out, I probably could relocate Smith.
You know, uh, maybe you could help me with that.
Make sure it doesn't succeed?
Wait, you mean, like, sabotage it?
No.
Oh, no, no, no.
No, I want you to be head ranger.
It just so happens that the only way to do that is to bring down this festival.
But spend the rest of your life as second-in-command if you like.
That's fine.
It's a perfectly valid life choice.
Well, you just think about it and give me a call, okay?
Here's my card.
So long.
Hey.
Now why is it doing that?
No.
Boy Scouts are loyal, thrifty, kind...
Hey, you're back.
Hey, thanks for getting those fliers out.
Let me tell you, this festival is gonna be huge.
Hey, Ranger Smith, how long do you think until I reach head ranger status?
Oh, no time at all.
I did it in 12 short years.
Ha, okay.
Are you serious?
Just be patient, Jones.
It'll be here before you know it.
This festival's gonna be great!
I can't wait 12 years.
[PEOPLE CHEERING AND LAUGHING]
Seasons pass order forms.
Seasons pass order forms.
Thank you.
Seasons pass order forms, $10 off today.
Ah, enjoy.
I can't take it, Boo Boo.
Two days without a tasty treat to eat?
And I have to sit up here while they're having a "happy birthday, Jellystone" party?
[SNIFFING]
And they have doughnuts.
Doughnuts!
BOO BOO [OVER RADIO]:
Yogi, what are you doing?
- Yogi!
- I'm going.
Hey.
Wait.
Don't do it, Yogi.
You promised Mr. Ranger.
You're right.
I'm losing control, Boo Boo.
I don't know who's steering the ship.
Here.
I want you to handcuff me to this tree and not unlock it no matter what I say.
Okay, Yogi.
- Okay, unlock me.
- Huh?
It was a bad idea.
Unlock me.
[GRUNTING]
Unlock me!
[GROWLING]
Okay.
Here you go.
JONES:
Folks, I hate to say this, but there are no spots left.
Forecast called for thunderstorms.
Severe lightning.
I fear for your young ones.
[CAR HORN HONKING]
We're out of fireworks, I'm afraid.
It's just sparklers left.
Oh, no.
You look nice.
Your napkin matches your tie.
I don't need you to kiss up to me.
Got this guy for that.
That's a good point, sir.
You were gonna handle this situation, yet there are quite a few people here.
Sir, I tried.
All last night I spent taking down fliers.
I blocked the entrance with a vehicle to back up traffic.
I hung up "rabid squirrel" signs everywhere.
Those were hand-drawn.
- Nothing is working.
- You need to think of something, don't you?
Or maybe you're just not head ranger material.
Mr. Mayor.
Mayor's yes man.
So glad you could join us.
I saved you a nice spot next to the porta-potties.
Oh, well, thank you.
Well, that's very thoughtful.
You know, I'm just so glad that these festivities are going so well, Smith.
I just hope nothing goes wrong.
[HORN HONKING]
We are gonna pull this off, Jonesy.
I've seen hundreds of people filling out seasons pass order forms.
The weather's great.
The fireworks, ready to go.
Even Yogi's staying out of the way.
Yogi.
[GROANING]
Hey, guys.
Sorry, just wandering around, bored out of my mind.
Bored?
But the 100th anniversary extravaganza's going on.
Yeah, more like 100th anniversary lame-aganza.
You know, because it's so lame.
People see fireworks every day in the city.
They thought they'd see something different here.
I knew it.
I should be out there doing my water-ski routine.
I'm a shining star and Ranger Smith is holding me back.
I don't know, Yogi.
Mr. Ranger is usually right about these things.
No, Boo Boo, Ranger Smith is in denial.
I mean, he's lost it, you know?
I saw him a couple days ago.
He was filling his pockets with dirt.
He said he's gonna start moving the park to his apartment piece by piece.
- How big is his apartment?
- There's still time.
I won't be able to do the half-hour artistic program but that was more for me anyway.
These people need the razzle-dazzle.
I don't think we've practiced the razzle-dazzle.
You're not supposed to, Boo Boo.
That's where it gets the razzle.
Yogi, I really don't think we should...
Boo Boo, you've tried to stop my brilliant ideas with common sense a thousand times.
Has it ever worked?
No.
Then let's go, go, go.
What does that taste like?
Unemployment?
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah.
Thanks again for helping with the fireworks.
I don't know where Jones disappeared to.
My pleasure.
You know, um, Rachel, I've been wanting to tell you well, how much I...
- Ranger...
No, please, let me get through this.
I'm not very good with words.
But I have never felt so gushy.
Ha-ha-ha.
- You know?
- Ranger...
You know what I did?
I went and I wrote a song about you.
It's like this:
[HUMMING]
Oh, no.
[SINGING] I saw you at the station
Had a heart palpitation
My sickness was love And you're the medication
Rachel
- Rachel
- The microphone is on.
SMITH:
And it comes around again
Rachel, Rachel, Rachel
The microphone is on.
Yes, the mic...
[CLEARS THROAT THEN LAUGHS]
Hi.
Hello and welcome to the 100th anniversary of Jellystone!
[CHEERING]
Thank you.
It is so wonderful to see so many people here today.
I've noticed many of you filling out your seasons pass order forms.
We're more than happy to collect those after the fireworks.
But first, please, sit back, get comfortable and enjoy the show!
- Terrific.
- Mr. Mayor?
[POISON'S "NOTHIN' BUT A GOOD TIME" PLAYING ON STEREO]
That's not the right music.
I'll take it from here, Mr. Ranger!
Oh, no.
Full speed ahead, Boo Boo.
Okay.
Not bad, eh, Boo Boo?
Looking good, Yogi.
- This cannot be happening.
- Oh, it's happening.
[YOGI STAMMERING]
Hello, Jellystone!
[CROWD CHEERING]
No, don't encourage him!
They love me.
I can do no wrong.
Watch this.
All right, Boo Boo!
Turn up the heat!
Phase two, go.
I'm an unstoppable water-skiing machine.
[LAUGHING]
Ta-da!
Oh, wait.
There's more.
How about if I heat things up?
[SMITH WHIMPERS]
[GROANING]
Don't need nothin' but a good time
And it don't get better than this
Yogi!
Yogi, your cape.
I know.
It is magnificent.
And on fire.
Huh?
Fire!
[GROANING]
- Turn the boat!
- Huh?
- Turn, Boo Boo!
- Hang on, Yogi!
Too much razzle!

- Nice one.
- Thanks.

This could not have gone more perfectly.
Hey, you got a little, uh...
Never mind.
Let's go.
[SIGHS]
[WOOD SNAPPING AND CREAKING]
Mr. Ranger, I thought...
Yogi, that's the problem.
All the thinking.
Hey, you know what would be great?
If you didn't think.
If you could just be a regular bear.
You know, sitting in the woods, minding his own business.
But no, you're different.
You're smart.
And you'd rather spend your days being selfish and destructive while everyone else pays the price.
But I guess it wasn't enough, screwing up my life.
No, this time you had to go and bring down this entire park.
So tell me, Yogi how smart are you now?
Hey, there!
That was quite a show you put on yesterday.
Ha-ha-ha.
I can't wait to see what you do with this.
That's your new assignment.
Evergreen Park.
Oh, I think you're just going to find it delightful.
Oh, and, uh, Ranger Jones is gonna be taking over here.
Ranger Jones?
Well, I have got a press conference to plan.
You see, it turns out I've saved the city.
Don't forget to vote, my friend.
Brown for governor!
Ha-ha-ha.
He's not gonna vote for me, is he?
Uh, no.
You did everything you could.
Doesn't matter.
This park needed a ranger who could make it popular again.
I'm just some guy who knows how old every tree is.
Fat lot of good that did Jellystone.
Face it.
You and I are just two people who care about things that nobody else does and that's why we're alone.
Or maybe that's why we found each other.
Did you ever think of that?
Rachel, you and this park have one thing in common.
You both deserve a better man than me.
I can't believe he's really gone.
Yogi, are you okay?
I'm done being special, Boo Boo.
Ranger Smith was right.
My whole life, I've been different.
But it's done nothing but hurt people.
The world would be better off if I was only as smart as the average bear.
Yogi, what are you doing?
I'm leaving, Boo Boo.
- I am going to forage for food in the wild.
- Huh?
Might even catch some fish.
With my paws.
[SIGHS]
I'm just gonna grab a little something for the road.
Some chips and soda.
And this.
Peach pie.
Any more of that casserole?
Top shelf.
I'll be out there.
Fending for myself.
Foraging for food in the wild.
[METAL CLANKING]
Goodbye, horsepower limiter.
There's a new head ranger in town.
Let's see what you got.
[GRUNTING]
Perfect.
[SOBBING]
I'm sorry, Ranger Smith.
No more food.
No more pic-a-nickers.
How could this get any worse?
[THUNDER BOOMING]
Oh.
Ah, Evergreen Park.
Yes, it is simply delightful.
[GIGGLING]
- Come on.
- I've got it, sir.
This is unbelievable.
Ah, Evergreen Park.
Lovely, isn't it?
This isn't a park.
I can barely breathe in here.
Look at these trees.
They're all plastic.
Oh, no, they're real.
It's just years of smog and pollution have left a plastic-like coating on them.
Think people will be happy you're closing the most beautiful park in the state?
Well, they will be when they find out it's making the city rich and giving each citizen a check for $1000.
How is that even possible?
Oh, well, it turns out that there has been some agricultural interest in the park.
And it's a lot more profitable than people in station wagons making s'mores.
[LAUGHING]
Have a good day, Ranger Smith.
I hate this car.
I hate it.
[GRUNTS]
[CHAINSAWS BUZZING]
Yeah!
Oh, hey, there he is.
Ha-ha-ha.
Whoa, hey, Mr. Mayor!
I, uh...
Just finishing some stamping.
You are doing great, Jones.
I knew you were the guy for this job.
Quick thing.
You'll probably notice some giant trucks rumbling by.
We're just clearing a little patch of trees for my press conference.
No big deal.
Um, wait, you're cutting down trees?
Oh, yeah.
Well, just a few.
It's nothing to worry about.
Actually gonna improve the park quite a bit.
I'll bet one of the first things you noticed as head ranger is that you need more clear spaces here, and you are absolutely right.
Now you can host concerts and Boy Scout jamborees.
That's a pretty smart move there, Head Ranger Jones.
I have some other park improvements I want to run by you.
Oh, splendid, yes.
I think I have a few moments to hear those.
Look into the security arrangements for tomorrow.
I don't want any surprises.
I'll hear what Ding-Dong has to say.
What do you got?
I'm hungrier than the average bear.
I wish I could find a bush that tasted like birthday cake.
Gotcha.
[GROANS]
Pretend it's a gummy worm.
Pretend it's a gummy worm.
[GASPS]
Yogi, I've been looking everywhere for you.
Not now, Boo Boo.
I'm busy foraging.
[GROANS]
[SHOUTS]
Come on, Yogi.
Jellystone is in trouble.
We need your help.
Nothing I can do, Boo Boo.
I'm average now.
My brain is out of business.
I wouldn't even be standing if my paws didn't hurt.
Quit feeling sorry for yourself.
You know you're not an average bear.
Hey, hey, Boo Boo.
You're right, I'm not.
I failed at that too.
Hey, come back here.
You've gotta save Jellystone.
YOGI:
What are you doing?
I'm not...
Yogi, you have to use your smarts for good.
And if you can't see that, maybe you are just an average bear.
Come on.
[GRUNTING]
Now do you understand?
What's going on, Boo Boo?
I don't know.
But whatever it is I think they're just getting started.
Boo Boo get my collar.
Nobody is gonna hurt Jellystone.
Where are we going, Yogi?
We can't get Jellystone back alone, Boo Boo.
My thinker is good, but Ranger Smith's is better.
He was going to a place called Evergreen Park.
That's right.
In the city.
The city?
That's a long walk.
Don't be silly, Boo Boo.
I've already got a smarty-smart cheat to keep our feet off the street.
Get ready for it.
Here it comes.
Run, Boo Boo, run!
Hurry, Boo Boo.
I think we gotta jump for it.
Ready?
All aboard.
Good.
Yogi, grab my paw.
[GROANING]
[GRUNTING]
Sorry.
[YOGI SHOUTING]
Boo Boo, Boo Boo, Boo Boo!
I gotta get...!
I guess it makes a stop here.
Yup.
Looks like Evergreen Park is about two miles away from here.
Two miles?
I'll have to tap into my emergency rations.
Snack break.
Come on, Yogi.
We need to keep moving.
It's not that far and it's all downhill.
Downhill?
Excuse me, Mr. Dirty Shopper.
Any chance my friend and I might borrow your wheely-basket?
Is that chocolate?
[YOGI AND BOO BOO LAUGHING]
Okay, Boo Boo, keep it steady.
I'm okay, Ma.
Just...
Yeah, no, it's not Jellystone, but at least there's nothing here to drive me crazy.
- Hey, Mr. Ranger.
- Hey, Yogi.
[CART CRASHES]
All right, Ma, I gotta call you back.
What are you guys doing here?
We need your help, Mr. Ranger, sir.
But don't worry, my days of goofing things up for you are over.
MAN:
Hey, move that shopping cart!
[SHOUTING]
I'm okay!
I'm just gonna put this over here.
What do you want?
I don't have a life left for you to ruin anymore.
Sir, I know I messed things up and I'm sorry.
I never meant to.
You and Boo Boo are the best friends I ever had.
And I've never done anything but think of myself.
And now Jellystone is just gonna be a big field of stumps.
What?
They've started cutting down the trees.
"Agricultural interest" is logging.
Oh, no, not our Jellystone.
We have to save it, sir.
I don't think we can save it, Yogi.
I'm no smarter than you.
I lost Jellystone.
I lost Rachel.
It's over.
Mr. Ranger, I've learned two things from stealing pic-a-nic baskets.
One:
light mayonnaise is not nearly as good as regular mayonnaise.
And two: you can't fail if you never stop trying.
You have to fight for the things you love whether it's a park, a girl or a roast beef sandwich.
Don't give up now.
We're all Jellystone's got.
You're right, Yogi.
Jellystone's too important to give up on.
We gotta try.
Come on.
- Shotgun.
- Aw.
I never thought I'd see this.
Happy 100th anniversary, Jellystone.
Isn't that Miss Movie Lady?
RACHEL:
I gotta get in there.
You don't understand.
Let me in, please.
No can do.
Park is closed to the public until the press conference.
Mayor's orders.
Then go talk to him.
Tell him what I told you.
I'm sorry.
I don't really take orders from a...
I lived with gorillas, pal.
I know rage.
You do not want me to go gorilla on you.
[SCREAMS]
Uh, I'll speak to the mayor.
- Thank you.
- Okay.
Rachel.
Ranger Smith.
I didn't think I'd ever see you again.
I know.
I don't know what I was thinking.
I think you're perfect.
I think any guy in the world would be lucky just to stand next to you.
You really mean that?
Of course I do.
It's just, when I lost Jellystone, I felt like such a failure.
But losing you has felt much, much worse.
I'm like...
I'm like a genus without a phylum.
That's the sweetest thing anyone's ever said to me.
- So, um, we're still here.
YOGI:
Mm-hm.
Oh, right.
Ahem.
So, what are you doing here?
- Come on, I'll show you.
- Okay.
I was reviewing the documentary footage from Boo Boo's camera and I saw this.
Oh, my.
I see it.
I have a bald spot back there!
I'm not talking about you, Yogi.
I'm talking about this.
Yeah, it's my pet turtle.
He hangs out at the cave all the time.
True.
You know they don't come out of that shell?
I tried one time to see what one would look like without it.
But, nope, they're sewn in.
This is no regular turtle.
See the bulging frog-like eyes and the really wide mouth?
A frog-mouthed turtle?
Yup, Rafetus swinhoei.
SMITH:
But those are extinct.
For a hundred years, but apparently one still exists.
And he lives in there.
But they won't let me through the gates to go find him.
But if Jellystone has an endangered species living in it, then...
It has to be protected as a park.
That's the law.
That turtle can save this park.
Now I feel kinda bad about using him as a foot stool.
CHIEF:
You've seen the filmmaker?
Well, we spoke.
About extinct turtles.
You're telling me there is an extinct turtle living here in the park?
According to Miss Johnson's film, there is.
An extinct turtle?
That's great.
Visitors will come from miles around to see an endangered species.
Yes, they will, and that is great.
We need to find this turtle.
Just to keep it safe.
Have a vet check it out.
The whole deal.
The sooner we get to him the better.
Oh, we need a head ranger who's good enough to find it.
Someone who thinks like a turtle.
I am that head ranger.
Well, then why are you still here?
He's back.
Come on.
You need to let us in this park.
That turtle needs protection.
Don't worry about the turtle.
We're handling it.
We'll make sure he's put in a nice zoo.
No.
A turtle that's endangered can't be removed from its natural habitat.
It's against federal law.
It is?
Wow, I've never heard of that law in chapter 4, subsection 6 of the Wildlife Protection Mandate.
Don't worry, Mr. Ranger, sir.
That turtle is safe.
These people have no idea where my cave is.
The turtle's in the talking bear's cave.
JONES [OVER RADIO]:
Copy.
Wow, that backfired.
Okay.
You know what?
Fine,
You win.
What are you doing?
I have a plan.
One of the advantages of having lived here since I was a kid is I know this park like the back of my hand.
Let's go!
Hold on, boys.
All right.
Hey, there, little buddy.
Hello, there.
Uh-oh.
Sorry about that.
- Mayor Brown.
- This had better be good, Jones.
JONES:
I found the turtle.
He was in Boo Boo's sleeping bag.
But now I have him secure at the picnic area.
Jones, you're a hero.
Sit tight.
My chief of staff is on his way to get him.
Copy that.
Head Ranger Jones over and out.
SMITH:
He found the turtle.
Dang it.
Can't cross those rapids.
There's no way to get to him from here.
Well, there is one way.
There it is.
My masterpiece.
- You really think you can pull this off?
- I know I can, sir.
I'm gonna snatch that basket-type turtle box and fly away like a fuzzy bird.
And I've got the best copilot a basket-snatching machine could have.
- I don't know how to fly this thing.
- Well, you'll pick it up as we go.
SMITH:
Okay.
Look, just be careful, okay, Yogi?
Copy that, ground control.
Basket-Nabber 2000 ready for takeoff.
- Flight systems check.
Boo Boo?
- What?
- Can you reach the pedals?
- If I point my toes.
Flight systems are go.
Remember what I told you about flying gliders, Yogi.
Don't fight the wind.
As long as the wind wants me to snatch up that turtle, we'll get along just fine.
- All right.
YOGI:
Start pedaling, Boo Boo.
All right.
Here goes.
YOGI:
Hold on, Boo Boo.
Fasten your seat belt.
But there isn't one.
YOGI:
Here we go!
BOO BOO:
Oh, Yogi!
The wind should carry you south!
We'll meet you there!
Take your time, Mr. Ranger.
This machine is equipped with landing gear.
We'll touch down as soft as a feather.
Whoops.
This is your captain speaking.
We'll reach our turtle target in about two minutes.
So let's go ahead and start the beverage service.
- Yogi, look out.
- Aah!
- Trees!
- Yes, trees!
[BOTH SCREAMING]
I got it.
I got it.
I got it.
I don't got it!
BOO BOO:
Pull up.
- Hey!
- Pull up!
You did it, Yogi.
Oh.
Yeah.
Ha-ha-ha.
Great job, Jones.
I'll get this guy to the city zoo.
- The city zoo?
- Yep.
They got a nice spot ready in the reptile house.
The city zoo doesn't have a reptile house.
They're building one.
- Who is?
- Builders.
Sure you're trying to protect the turtle?
Yeah, we love turtles.
Then you won't mind if I hold onto him until I notify the Wildlife Federation, right?
All right.
You're gonna find this out in a few hours anyway, so I might as well tell you.
We gotta lose this turtle to sell logging rights to the park.
Logging?
The whole park?
Yeah, but who cares?
It's still a park, just without trees.
And they'll grow back.
Yeah, in like 200 years.
It doesn't matter.
Your career is what matters.
Ha-ha-ha.
Turtle target acquired.
I need 20 more feet of altitude.
Engage the hand pedals.
You couldn't put the hand pedals by you?
There's a suggestion box behind the seat, Boo Boo.
[GROANS]
Wait, you don't want to approach him like that.
He's poisonous.
He's in a basket.
But he can spit.
Poison.
He'll aim at your eyes.
Melt them out of your head.
- I'm telling you, that turtle is deadly.
- What are you looking at?
- Hook me in, Boo Boo.
- Okay.
And fire!
Here you go.
Huh?
Yogi, wait!
Here I come!
He's going for the turtle.
- Mind if I borrow this?
- Hey!
[YOGI LAUGHS]
Look, Boo Boo!
We got the turtle!
Hey, why aren't you in your seat?
That bear knows how to steal a basket.
Everybody after that glider now!
I'm not gonna let a bear make me look bad.
Been there, buddy.
We're drifting too far right.
I wanna get us outside the park.
Don't fight the wind, Yogi.
Remember what Miss Movie Lady said about...
Never mind.
YOGI:
Hang on, Boo Boo.
- What do we do now?
Did you check the safety manual?
It's just a picture of us screaming.
[BOTH SCREAMING]
We've got to deject, Boo.
Don't you mean eject?
Eject is up.
Deject is down.
In case of emergency your seat can also be used as a flotation device!
[YOGI LAUGHING]
[GRUNTING]
Hey, told you.
Nothing to worry about.
I actually think I wasn't worried enough.
Let me see how our little passenger is doing.
Wonder why they call him a frog-mouthed turtle anyway?
Hey!
SMITH:
Hey, guys, over here!
Yogi, grab the branch.
Got you, Mr. Ranger, sir.
[SMITH AND RACHEL GRUNT]
- Welcome aboard.
SMITH:
Yogi.
We were trying to get you off the raft.
Yeah, that makes more sense.
You guys did it.
You saved him.
[CAR HORN HONKS]
Oh, no.
They're gonna catch us downstream.
I'm on it.
No, Yogi, don't.
Problem solved.
They can't catch us now.
Yeah, because now we are headed straight for the Jellyjarring Rapids.
[GRUNTS]
- Grab a paddle.
- Tuck your head in, little buddy.
Brace yourselves.
Oh, come on, turtle.
Don't worry, I put safety belts in this raft for just such an occasion.
You better hang on.
Mr. Ranger said...
YOGI:
We're gonna be fine, Boo Boo.
Just sit back and let Mother Nature carry us to...
[ALL SCREAMING]
I think Mother Nature's kind of cranky today.
You okay, Yogi?
Fine!
Turtle!
YOGI:
Who's that?
I can't see.
Come here, turtle.
- Got him.
SMITH:
Good work, Boo Boo.
We made it through the rapids.
Yeah, but that means the falls are just up ahead.
Hold on!
[SCREAMING]
Yogi.
Yogi.
Now who says there are no rides at Jellystone?
Yeah, you've definitely got the thrill part down.
ANNOUNCER:
Please, take your seats.
The press conference is about to begin.
That's over a mile away.
We're never gonna make that in time.
[ALL GASP]
- Ranger Jones?
- I messed up pretty bad, sir.
- I know.
It's okay.
- I wanted to be head ranger.
Because you're a good head ranger and I value leadership.
I have a merit badge...
Can we talk later?
We're pressed for time.
Yes.
Get in.
[SIREN WAILING]
YOGI:
Boo Boo!
Boo Boo!
Wait up!
SMITH:
Well, well.
Guess who we found.
Starts with T and ends with a... "Urtle"?
It's over.
Call off the logging.
The law says this park is now a protected nature preserve.
You think I care about what the law says?
Or about some endangered "frog-mouthed turtle"?
Or some stupid park for families to have a picnic in?
I care about power, you pinheads!
And I'm gonna get it.
Nobody knows this turtle exists.
And nobody ever will.
You found the turtle.
Get this thing out of here before anybody else sees it.
- Rachel!
- Oh!
Yogi!
BOO BOO:
Yogi, here!
Thank you.
- Yogi.
- I'm sorry.
He was open.
Ha, ha.
Now if you'll excuse me, I have a press conference.
I can still tell them what you did.
Oh, yeah?
Without that turtle or a scrap of evidence, go right ahead.
Well, you might as well tell them Bigfoot is here.
Ha-ha-ha.
And do yourself a favor, there, ranger.
Try to keep your dignity.
It's all you have left.
You know what?
I'm taking care of this thing myself this time.
That's the only way to make sure the job is done right.
But that's why I'm the mayor's right-hand man, right?
Because I don't make mistakes.
Hey, you know, people are wondering:
"Why should I vote for Mayor Brown to be governor?"
Well, how about this:
Mayor Brown just turned the city's budget from a deficit into a surplus!
And put $1000 into the pocket of every citizen of this city!
Now before I sign the paperwork that will save the city why don't you all take a look at my first campaign ad for governor?
ANNOUNCER:
Mayor Brown, the right choice for governor.
We're out of time.
Must be something we can do.
Anybody have any ideas?
Well, I guess this is going to be a pretty sad documentary, huh?
Are you...?
Is he still filming?
I needed more footage, so I told him to keep it rolling.
I can plug that into the video feed right up there.
I just need a way to distract the guards.
I think we can take care of that.
ANNOUNCER:
He supports public safety.
[JOURNEY'S "DON'T STOP BELIEVING" PLAYING ON TV]
All right, hurry up, people.
Focus.
Let's go save those orphans.
YOGI:
Hey, hey, hey, check this out!
- Kick it, Boo Boo.
- Kicking it.
Don't stop believing
[LAUGHING]
Hold on to that feeling
ANNOUNCER:
He's tough on crime.
[SHOUTS]
Hey, hey, hey, look at this.
Keep your eye on the little bear.
Look at the skills.
Amazing!
[GRUNTING]
ANNOUNCER:
And here's what Mayor Brown proudly has to say about protecting our natural resources.
[MUSIC STOPS]
You think I care about what the law says?
Or about some endangered "frog-mouthed turtle"?
- Some stupid park for families to picnic in?
- No.
No.
No.
I care about power, you pinheads!
Oh, boy.
Nobody knows this turtle exists.
And nobody ever will.
[BOOING AND JEERING]
[LAUGHING]
There's about to be a riot out there.
I need you out front.
[GRUNTS]
Okay.
No.
Hey, wait.
Wait, wait, wait.
Please, please, please.
That was not real.
Trust me, there is no such thing as a frog-mouthed turtle.
He's right next to me, isn't he?
Okay.
- We did it, Yogi!
- Up high, Boo Boo!
- All right!
JONES:
We got it!
Yogi!
All right, and now...
Miss Moviemaker Lady.
SMITH:
Hey, we did it.
[LAUGHING]
Hey, Mr. Ranger!
RACHEL:
Come on, Boo Boo.
- Okay.
I was wrong, Yogi.
I say from here on, we just be proud of who we are and fight for the things we're passionate about, like this park.
And Rachel.
And pic-a-nic baskets?
And pic-a-nic baskets.
- Aw, come here!
- No, you don't have to...
Okay.
All right, that's...
I'm good.
[CROWD CHATTERING]
RACHEL:
Here you go, Boo Boo.
Take good care of him.
Hey, there, buddy.
No, no, no, I never took a kickback on anything in my entire career.
No one loves turtles more than I do.
And nature in general.
I love trees.
Oh, no, you don't!
[GROWLS]
Gorilla?
Himalayan snow leopard.
Huh.
Welcome to Jellystone, home of the frog-mouthed turtle.
And brochures.
I'm Ranger Jones.
NARRATOR:
Ah, yes, Jellystone Park.
A wonderful little piece of paradise.
Where families come and soak up the tranquility of nature.
It's a place that...
[MACHINE WHIRRING]
Huh?
Never mind.
MAN:
Hey, hey, hey!
[CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY]
Hi.
Welcome.
Well, I am certainly glad that you are gonna be staying in Jellystone for a while.
And what animal will you be observing?
Well, I thought I would observe the courting rituals of the American ranger.
I happen to hear the American ranger is a very charming intelligent, attractive species.
One that always keeps his cool.
Even when basket-stealing bears push his buttons?
Listen, Yogi will be Yogi.
And I'm just not gonna let it bother me anymore.
Besides I have more important things to focus on.
Oh...
[LAUGHING]
I...
Let's...
Let's try that again.
[HORN HONKING]
[GASPING]
Afternoon, Mr. Ranger, sir!
Hi, Miss Movie Lady!
[BARKING]
Yogi!
I love this place.
SMITH:
Yogi!
Hey!
[English
- US
- SDH]
Jellystone Park.
One of the nation's oldest and most beautiful stretches of wilderness.
For years, families have headed out from the busy city eager to enjoy a little camping, fishing and, of course, observing the park's natural wildlife.
Boo Boo, I think it's time I introduced myself to that pic-a-nic basket.
You know, Yogi, we could just hunt for food.
All the other animals do.
Boo Boo, a pic-a-nic basket has everything a bear needs.
And I'm not just talking about the treats and snack-type goodies.
No.
A pic-a-nic basket holds a lot more than that.
It holds dreams.
What are we looking at?
I don't know.
Hook me in.
You sure it'll work, Yogi?
Well, you know, Boo Boo, I'm smarter than the average bear!
All right!
Ranger Smith!
Sorry about that.
We got a 4-23 in Redwood Valley, sir.
- A what?
- A bear disturbance.
- I think it's probably...
- I know who it is.
Why didn't you just say "bear disturbance"?
Well, I...
Uh, well, it sounds cooler.
I mean, we're park rangers, sir.
You know:
"To protect and preserve."
Did you just make that motto up?
Yeah, I did.
Do you like it?
Ranger Jones, you know that, well, being a park ranger, it's not about mottos.
It's about keeping the park safe.
That's where the glory is.
Protecting all of this.
Yeah, I know.
Besides, that motto was still in the testing phase.
It's not like I made T-shirts or anything.
Heh, no, of course not.
Okay, I'm gonna deal with that 4-23.
Okay, copy that, sir.
Um, I'm actually gonna hop in the Armadillo, make some rounds.
Jones, you know that the Armadillo is for head ranger use only.
I might need it at any moment to deal with a park emergency.
Why don't you finish stacking those trail maps?
Yeah, sure.
Okay.
Yeah, because that's what future head rangers do, they stack maps.
Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy!
Our days of getting banged up to grab a meal are over, Boo Boo.
From now on, the pic-a-nic baskets are going to fall into our arms.
Soldering iron.
Here you go.
- Thank you.
Okay.
That should do it.
Test rock.
Okay, Yogi.
Weight sensor triggered.
Basket in position.
Launch spring starts coiling.
Firing pin drops.
And...
Bull's-eye!
I'm so smart it hurts!
You're standing on the soldering iron.
Or it's that.
Hot, hot, hot!
There's the test rock.
Now we just wait here for a pic-a-nic basket to fall into our arms.
Are you sure about this, Yogi?
People seem to get pretty mad when you...
A genius never questions his instincts, Boo Boo.
When you have a mind like mine you can't blink or you'll put a kink in your think.
Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.
We've got our first customers.
And they have pie!
I wonder what kind it is.
Yogi, are you out here?
- It's Mr. Ranger.
- Aah!
Get rid of the test rock.
Destroy the evidence.
I was never here.
Look...
Ow!
Hello, Mr. Ranger, sir.
Did you just...?
Did you guys...?
Did you...?
Oh, never mind.
Look, there was a complaint about a bear interfering with a family picnic.
I see.
And you'd like us to mount some sort of investigation?
No, I think it was you.
What?
!
How can you even think that?
Are you feverish?
Let me press my lips against your forehead.
Wait!
You're not pressing your lips against my forehead.
Hey, it's a lot better than the way they take my temperature.
No, look, Yogi, we've been over this many times.
Bears are supposed to avoid people, not run around stealing their food.
I agree, sir.
That's why my friend Boo Boo and I would never think of disturbing a family's pic-a-nic.
Huh.
It missed.
Good day, Mr. Ranger, sir.
We'll keep our eyes peeled.
I wonder if he noticed the pie.
Ra...
Smith.
You have a vis...
Over.
Didn't understand a word of that, Jones.
- Sorry.
Some lady's here to see you.
- Send her in.
- Okay.
I'll be in the Armadillo.
- Or you could be...
- Map stacking?
- Map stacking.
- Ranger Smith?
- Yes.
- Hello.
I'm Rachel Johnson.
- Hi.
I was hoping to talk to you about filming a documentary here.
Sure.
I can handle you for that.
Handle that for you.
Sorry.
My work isn't...
My brain isn't working right.
- I must have inhaled some jimsonweed.
- Oh.
Datura stramonium.
It's known to cause delirium cramping and nausea.
Heh.
- Cramping and nausea.
You've read The North American Wilderness Guide.
Yeah, I like to highlight all the plants and animals I see.
- I like to...
Me too.
- Ha, ha!
Yeah.
Ranger Smith.
At your service.
You want to film a documentary in Jellystone?
Yes.
I sent you a letter about a month ago.
- Written on a piece of bark.
- That was you!
Yes.
I'm sorry about that.
I was in Sumatra, living among the orangutans at the time and they get very nervous if they spot anything from the modern world.
Really?
Wow, that's amazing.
Then what did you use for ink?
Bird poop and spit.
Impressive.
So, what are you here to film?
Well, I was hoping to shoot a local species.
Something to really capture the beauty of a national park.
Terrific.
What animal were you thinking?
I heard you had an unusual brown bear.
- Brown bear?
- Yes.
One that talks?
Those are so rare.
- None that I can think of.
- Named Yogi?
Wears a hat and a tie?
No, that doesn't ring a bell.
I think he's standing on the roof, trying to steal your lunchbox.
I smell PB and J.
I'm all done.
Oh, right.
That Yogi.
Bankrupt?
No, no, no.
We're a city.
Cities don't go bankrupt.
They do when they're broke, sir.
We just have to find some money somewhere.
I'm about to run for governor.
How am I gonna do that when my own city is bankrupt?
Okay, yes.
Thank you.
- Here's the invoice, Mr. Mayor.
- Yikes!
Wow.
Ha.
I'm gonna pretend I didn't see that.
Just bill it to the city, okay?
Thank you.
Ugh.
How did we ever go so broke?
- I think we just spent too much.
- Hmm.
Is there anything we can sell?
You already sold the public golf course to condo developers two of the three fire stations to that frozen yogurt company.
You were selling the library, but it burned down.
Oh, yeah.
That was gonna be one of those make-your-own-doughnut places.
- No.
- Yeah.
- Lf you could dream it up, you could make it.
- Ah.
Love those.
We gotta think of something here.
Well, if we don't have anything to sell, maybe we can profit off what we can't sell.
I don't understand those words.
Like when we sold the bottling rights to the water in Lake Beuclair.
- We made a fortune.
- Yeah.
Sinkhole Beuclair is a great place to throw old mattresses.
- Oh, yeah.
- Hmm.
We just don't have any more resources to exploit.
Or do we?
Jellystone.
If we rezone Jellystone Park as agricultural land, we can sell the logging rights.
Here.
This company says they'll give us thousands of dollars an acre just to cut down the trees or something.
That'll be enough to balance the budget and give each citizen a big fat check.
You have any idea how many votes that'll buy me?
- Enough to be the next governor?
- Exactly.
You're fine, Yogi.
It's just a few scrapes and bruises.
I don't know, Mr. Ranger.
I'm pretty sure I heard my spine snap.
Well, you wouldn't be able to stand.
And you wouldn't be able to eat.
I'm okay!
Yogi, Boo Boo, I would like to introduce you to Rachel Johnson who's here to make a nature documentary.
What the heck was that?
I was saying hello.
I lived in a den with brown bears for six months.
Only bear I've ever lived with is Boo Boo.
And he only makes that sound after he's eaten baked beans.
Heh, heh.
I have problems with baked beans.
And for a little bear, he makes a lot of stink.
Okay, I have some fantastic river otters you can film instead.
- Could get a hat and tie on the slow one.
- No, you know, I really, really like these two.
- Would you guys mind if I shoot you?
Huh?
Yogi, I think she meant with a camera.
Yes.
Of course with a camera.
Heh-heh-heh.
I knew that.
But not just any camera.
This isn't gonna make me look fat, is it?
No, you are gonna look great.
Okay, just a few more adjustments.
Please, excuse the pre-tied bow tie.
My mornings are often rushed.
It's fine, Boo Boo.
This is going to be a whole new perspective for a documentary.
The Boo Boo cam will capture the true wilderness in all its natural glory.
No other human in sight.
That sounds like my apartment.
Ha, ha.
Uh, you know, because I live alone.
Well, plenty of women have tried to change that.
It's just, I haven't found one that...
- Likes you?
- What?
No.
No, that...
Will return your calls?
Can you stop helping, please?
Sir, I can see you like this lady.
But your courting rituals need work.
What you need to do is follow her around for two days making snorting sounds.
Then fight any male that looks at her.
And then, of course, urinate on her to mark her as your territory.
Works every time.
I got it under control, Yogi.
- Boo Boo, you're rolling.
- Cool.
Yogi Bear, a brown bear commonly found in North America and Alaska.
Weighing up to 1800 pounds, brown bears are also the national animal of Finland.
I don't think you have to narrate.
But I liked where you were going with it, Boo Boo.
- I was hooked.
- Really?
Yes.
Now try to film from flattering angles, if you know what I mean.
Pic-a-nic baskets may be delicious on the lips, but they're a lifetime on the hips.
Oh, no.
Ranger Smith!
Ranger Smith.
The mayor's here.
What's he doing here?
Why didn't he give us more warning?
I have to secure the area.
All units, lock down the park.
Repeat, lock down the park.
Jones, you know I'm the only other ranger here, right?
Yeah.
- Ranger Smith, we need to talk.
- You could've just called.
Yeah, but I thought this would be more friendly.
I'm really working on my people skills.
Anyway, I am closing your park down.
- Okay.
- What?
Oh, yeah, this place just costs the city way too much money.
Jellystone hasn't made its operating budget in 10 years.
You know, it's hard to compete with all those amusement parks...
Oh, hey, you're not kidding.
Oh, have you guys been to Lincoln Log Land yet?
Oh, man, they have got a roller coaster there, it's made completely out of logs.
It's just like they rode in the pioneer days.
It's unbelievable.
Sir, Jellystone is special.
Okay?
It's turning 100 years old this very year.
Why, it's a landmark.
I would never let it be closed down.
Well, uh, you actually don't have a choice.
Have you read the city bylaws lately?
Chapter 6.
Section 73.
"Any municipal property that can't generate enough money to cover its operating budget can be rezoned for other uses."
And since Jellystone loses money every year, we're shutting it down.
Uh, sorry?
- I thought that went well.
Yeah.
Just a second, Mr. Mayor.
Who says we can't cover our budget?
Park doesn't report earnings till next quarter.
Yeah, which is like one week away.
Come on, Smith.
You gotta be $20,000 in the hole.
We wish.
Yeah.
Try 30,562.
That's probably a couple hundred extra for the map stand.
I think it's confession time.
- I only pretended to fix it.
- Thanks, Jones.
Sounds like you're in pretty deep there, Smith.
Maybe we are.
But this is one of the last places families can go to be close to nature.
The world needs that.
Well, I'm not mayor of the world.
I'm mayor of this city.
And this city needs this park rezoned.
I'm sorry.
I feel awful about it.
Even though I look really good.
This is a new suit.
So, okay.
Maybe we don't have our operating budget today.
But you know what?
- A lot can happen in a week.
- All right.
Have it your way.
Take a week.
Hey, I'll even get you started.
What's the admission fee for one car again?
Four dollars.
Four dollars, huh?
Four whole dollars?
Well, that changes everything.
Oh, my goodness.
Well, I only need to come back in here like, uh, what, 10,000 more times?
In a week!
Do I have time for that?
- Impossible.
- Oh, shoot.
You want-a some-a lasagna?
You hungry, buddy?
Of course!
I'm always hungry.
I was talking to my pet turtle.
Here you go.
That better not be my beef jerky.
So, what's the big deal, Yogi?
This is the big deal, Boo Boo.
It's my masterpiece.
The Basket-Nabber 2000.
The most advanced pic-a-nic basket-stealing technology ever invented.
Wow.
Climb aboard.
This glider can steer dive, shoot rubber bands at pesky-type birds and even has an air bag.
Had an air bag.
Sorry, Yogi.
Not to worry.
We could cushion our landing with all the pic-a-nic baskets we swipe.
Now, how's that copilot seat feel?
A little wobbly, like it's not tied on very tight.
You won't feel that in the air.
Get ready to fly faster than the speed of sandwich, Boo Boo.
We're gonna break the pic-a-nic barrier.
Yogi!
- Uh-oh.
That's not his happy voice.
Don't move.
I'm switching the glider into stealth mode.
Stealth mode?
Wow.
How are you able to...?
Oh.
Ah, Mr. Ranger, sir.
Welcome.
Can I interest you in a sody pop?
- There you go.
- When did you steal our vending machine?
I, um...
I'm repairing it, sir.
This machine gives its sodas away for free when a bear kicks it.
Look, a camper has reported some missing fishing poles so I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say it was you.
Fishing poles?
Sir, I'm a bear.
If I wanted to catch fish, I would just use my...
Your paws, Yogi.
Isn't that kind of unsanitary?
What's that?
- What's what?
- That thing.
- What thing?
- The thing under the blanket.
- Blanket?
- The object right behind you.
Oh.
Oh, that.
Heh.
A sculpture.
I'm sculpting now.
Mostly landscapes.
And where's Boo Boo?
- France.
- What?
- That's not close by, is it?
- No.
Then he's in the bathroom.
- Excuse me.
- Wait!
Hey, this isn't the bathroom.
I'm telling you, Mr. Ranger, it's not for stealing pic-a-nic baskets.
It says "Basket-Nabber 2000" right here, Yogi.
I do regret calling it that now.
I know I'm always saying, "Stay away from the campers."
This is different.
Jellystone is in real trouble.
If I don't raise $30,000 in a week, this park's getting rezoned.
Rezoned?
What does that mean?
It means the park won't be a park anymore.
The city will use this land for something else.
So we have got to do everything we can to help save it.
Which means you have gotta stop stealing food so that campers will leave here happy.
But they do leave here happy.
Getting your food stolen by Yogi Bear is special.
People come here for that.
It's like catching a foul ball at a baseball game.
Nope.
It's like getting your food stolen at a baseball game.
Come on, Yogi.
Would it really be so hard to be a regular bear?
You know, to forage for food, to walk around on all fours to hibernate a little, or a lot.
If nature had meant for me to be a regular bear it wouldn't have given me such a good thought-cooker, sir.
I can't help it if my melon is full of smart juice.
Yogi, your melon is hurting this park.
There are repercussions to stealing people's picnic baskets.
Not in my experience, sir.
On the other hand...
Ranger Smith, mind if I borrow the 'dilla?
It's an emergency.
Somebody parked without parking decals.
Jones, I would really prefer it if you focused on just maintaining the park instead.
Let me deal with the visitors until you've had more experience.
Sorry, sir.
Guess that's just the Eagle Scout in me, you know?
Always wanting to be in control, be a leader.
Live up to this fanny pack full of merit badges.
You know that fanny pack is for first aid supplies, right?
A merit badge in first aid is the only supply I need, sir.
Right, but it might not be the only supply a hurt person needs.
You seen Rachel?
Yeah, I saw her.
She was heading up to Lookout Mountain.
She can't be far.
I'll drive.
Let's roll.
Jones.
The sprawling beauty of Jellystone Park.
A timeless stretch of wilderness untouched by man.
Oh.
Ranger Smith.
Wow, heh.
What's with the fancy outfit?
Dress greens.
I always wear dress greens in the evening.
You know, in case there's, you know...
- I don't know how to talk to girls.
- Oh.
Why do you think I spend so much time with animals?
All you have to do is scratch their backside and you've got a friend for life.
Try that with people and all of a sudden you're the weird girl on the bus that nobody wants to sit next to.
Um, uh, listen.
I was wondering, you know, if you were...
I mean, it's getting late and we could, uh...
If you want.
I mean, it's not that...
You don't...
It's...
You know, it's not a worry.
Don't worry.
Did you just ask me to dinner?
Yes.
I did.
Heh.
- Good, you got that, huh?
- Yes.
I just thought, well, it's getting late.
I happen to know this great place.
- Very gourmet.
- Really?
Where?
So close you won't believe it.
Wow, how did you ever find this place?
This is a four-star porch.
And fresh from the hot plate, I give you rack of Spam.
- Oh.
Wow.
Maybe "gourmet" was a bit of a stretch.
No, it actually looks wonderful.
Great.
You know, this really is a peaceful place.
It's something, isn't it?
I pretty much grew up here.
My father was a ranger when I was a kid and he turned this park into the number one tourist destination in the state.
I mean, it was a park, you know?
Like families came by the hundreds swam in the streams, hiked on the trails.
It was really something.
This is really good.
Anyway, I don't know.
Maybe it's my fault.
I spent so many years learning everything I could about the park so I'd be a better ranger.
Maybe instead, I should have come up with a gimmick to get people to come here.
You know, change the name to Extreme Jellystone.
- I think that it's perfect just the way it is.
- You do?
You're right.
Absolutely.
There's no better place on earth.
Hey, Mr. Ranger.
- Except a place without him.
Evening, Mr. Ranger, sir.
Madame Moviemaker Lady.
And yes, I'm using the fancy tense to show you the utmost respect.
Hi.
Ha, ha.
What do you want, Yogi?
Well, I was thinking about the park's prickly predicament and I would like to do my part to help.
This is all the money I have saved.
Almost $100.
I was going to use it on myself, but I'd rather donate it to Jellystone.
Well, thank you, Yogi.
That's...
That is very sweet.
- Where does a bear get money from?
- That brown box by the parking lot.
The park donation box.
Yep.
But I want you to have it.
Consider it a gift to Jellystone.
That won't be hard.
Look, guys, I appreciate the effort.
But what this park needs is visitors and lots of them.
Well, I can help you there, sir.
Just make me a headliner.
I will rock this place.
- Kick it, Boo Boo.
- Kicking it.
I like big butts and I cannot lie You other brothers can't deny
That when a girl walks in With a itty-bitty waist
And a round thing in your face You get sprung
That's not gonna work either, Yogi.
You're right.
We need something flashier than music.
Not a problem.
I've got this water-skiing routine that will change the face of entertainment.
Got a little of everything.
Music, stunts, magic.
- And I jump over Boo Boo at the end.
- No, you don't.
- I want to try it.
- I don't care.
I hate to interrupt, but you're not gonna water-ski or dance or do anything that might disturb the campers, okay?
If what you really want to do is help save this park you will lay low, stay away from people.
Think you can do that for me?
You have my word, Mr. Ranger.
I will be seen, but not heard.
Or seen.
Fine.
Huh?
You guys done with that Spam?
- Get out of here.
- Okay.
Sheesh!
Hey.
What's this?
Seasons pass applications.
Unfortunately, not a lot of takers on those.
Fifty bucks for an entire year?
Including camping fees?
That's a bargain.
If this were a place people wanted to visit throughout the year.
Maybe Yogi was on to something.
- You said the park was turning 100, right?
- Right.
Well, a big event could really pull people in.
Yeah, you're right.
We could have, like, a moss collection day or a big squirrel chase.
- Or...
- Fireworks.
Yes.
Exactly.
Why didn't I think of that?
We could host a big centennial festival.
People always show up for fireworks.
If even half of the people buy season passes the park makes enough money to stay open.
Right.
Let's get the word out.
I think I can help with that.
That is great.
How did we pay for it?
We didn't.
It was some fast-food restaurant but I rearranged the letters right before the plane took off.
You're very cool, Rachel Johnson.
You're pretty cool yourself.
I do have my own kind of natural swagger.
Jellystone National Park, 100th year anniversary.
There'll be fireworks.
Just stay calm, Jones.
You should be patrolling in the Armadillo making park-impacting decisions, but...
- Hey, 100th year anniversary.
- Thanks.
But you're not there yet.
You still have to follow orders.
Even if those orders make you look like a giant Cheez-It.
Mr. Mayor!
Hi, Mr. Mayor.
Why is it only going halfway down again?
Doesn't make any...
No!
Oh, okay.
Is it a double tap or do I have to press it...?
- Oh, dang it!
- I got it, sir.
Yeah.
That's exactly what I did.
Let me see one of those fliers.
"Come celebrate Jellystone's 100th anniversary with fireworks and fun."
"And receive $10 off a season pass"?
He's gonna try to make the budget selling season passes.
Yeah, ugh.
It's not a very good idea, in my opinion.
But nobody consulted me, because my job is just to maintain the park which is basically poking trash with a stick.
Yeah.
Yeah, why is a guy with your talent doing this insulting grunt work?
You should be running a park.
Yeah, but Ranger Smith says I have to pay my dues.
- Excuse me?
- What?
- He has to pay his dues?
Ha.
- Ha, ha.
Nobody pays dues anymore.
You gotta be in charge now while you still know everything.
- That's what I've been saying.
- Yeah.
Buddy, if it was up to me, you would be the head ranger of Jellystone already.
- You'd put me in charge?
- In a second.
Yes.
You know, if this centennial festival didn't work out, I probably could relocate Smith.
You know, uh, maybe you could help me with that.
Make sure it doesn't succeed?
Wait, you mean, like, sabotage it?
No.
Oh, no, no, no.
No, I want you to be head ranger.
It just so happens that the only way to do that is to bring down this festival.
But spend the rest of your life as second-in-command if you like.
That's fine.
It's a perfectly valid life choice.
Well, you just think about it and give me a call, okay?
Here's my card.
So long.
Hey.
Now why is it doing that?
No.
Boy Scouts are loyal, thrifty, kind...
Hey, you're back.
Hey, thanks for getting those fliers out.
Let me tell you, this festival is gonna be huge.
Hey, Ranger Smith, how long do you think until I reach head ranger status?
Oh, no time at all.
I did it in 12 short years.
Ha, okay.
Are you serious?
Just be patient, Jones.
It'll be here before you know it.
This festival's gonna be great!
I can't wait 12 years.
Seasons pass order forms.
Seasons pass order forms.
Thank you.
Seasons pass order forms, $10 off today.
Ah, enjoy.
I can't take it, Boo Boo.
Two days without a tasty treat to eat?
And I have to sit up here while they're having a "happy birthday, Jellystone" party?
And they have doughnuts.
Doughnuts!
Yogi, what are you doing?
- Yogi!
- I'm going.
Hey.
Wait.
Don't do it, Yogi.
You promised Mr. Ranger.
You're right.
I'm losing control, Boo Boo.
I don't know who's steering the ship.
Here.
I want you to handcuff me to this tree and not unlock it no matter what I say.
Okay, Yogi.
- Okay, unlock me.
- Huh?
It was a bad idea.
Unlock me.
Unlock me!
Okay.
Here you go.
Folks, I hate to say this, but there are no spots left.
Forecast called for thunderstorms.
Severe lightning.
I fear for your young ones.
We're out of fireworks, I'm afraid.
It's just sparklers left.
Oh, no.
You look nice.
Your napkin matches your tie.
I don't need you to kiss up to me.
Got this guy for that.
That's a good point, sir.
You were gonna handle this situation, yet there are quite a few people here.
Sir, I tried.
All last night I spent taking down fliers.
I blocked the entrance with a vehicle to back up traffic.
I hung up "rabid squirrel" signs everywhere.
Those were hand-drawn.
- Nothing is working.
- You need to think of something, don't you?
Or maybe you're just not head ranger material.
Mr. Mayor.
Mayor's yes man.
So glad you could join us.
I saved you a nice spot next to the porta-potties.
Oh, well, thank you.
Well, that's very thoughtful.
You know, I'm just so glad that these festivities are going so well, Smith.
I just hope nothing goes wrong.
We are gonna pull this off, Jonesy.
I've seen hundreds of people filling out seasons pass order forms.
The weather's great.
The fireworks, ready to go.
Even Yogi's staying out of the way.
Yogi.
Hey, guys.
Sorry, just wandering around, bored out of my mind.
Bored?
But the 100th anniversary extravaganza's going on.
Yeah, more like 100th anniversary lame-aganza.
You know, because it's so lame.
People see fireworks every day in the city.
They thought they'd see something different here.
I knew it.
I should be out there doing my water-ski routine.
I'm a shining star and Ranger Smith is holding me back.
I don't know, Yogi.
Mr. Ranger is usually right about these things.
No, Boo Boo, Ranger Smith is in denial.
I mean, he's lost it, you know?
I saw him a couple days ago.
He was filling his pockets with dirt.
He said he's gonna start moving the park to his apartment piece by piece.
- How big is his apartment?
- There's still time.
I won't be able to do the half-hour artistic program but that was more for me anyway.
These people need the razzle-dazzle.
I don't think we've practiced the razzle-dazzle.
You're not supposed to, Boo Boo.
That's where it gets the razzle.
Yogi, I really don't think we should...
Boo Boo, you've tried to stop my brilliant ideas with common sense a thousand times.
Has it ever worked?
No.
Then let's go, go, go.
What does that taste like?
Unemployment?
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah.
Thanks again for helping with the fireworks.
I don't know where Jones disappeared to.
My pleasure.
You know, um, Rachel, I've been wanting to tell you well, how much I...
- Ranger...
No, please, let me get through this.
I'm not very good with words.
But I have never felt so gushy.
Ha-ha-ha.
- You know?
- Ranger...
You know what I did?
I went and I wrote a song about you.
It's like this:
Oh, no.
I saw you at the station
Had a heart palpitation
My sickness was love And you're the medication
Rachel
- Rachel
- The microphone is on.
And it comes around again
Rachel, Rachel, Rachel
The microphone is on.
Yes, the mic...
Hi.
Hello and welcome to the 100th anniversary of Jellystone!
Thank you.
It is so wonderful to see so many people here today.
I've noticed many of you filling out your seasons pass order forms.
We're more than happy to collect those after the fireworks.
But first, please, sit back, get comfortable and enjoy the show!
- Terrific.
- Mr. Mayor?
That's not the right music.
I'll take it from here, Mr. Ranger!
Oh, no.
Full speed ahead, Boo Boo.
Okay.
Not bad, eh, Boo Boo?
Looking good, Yogi.
- This cannot be happening.
- Oh, it's happening.
Hello, Jellystone!
No, don't encourage him!
They love me.
I can do no wrong.
Watch this.
All right, Boo Boo!
Turn up the heat!
Phase two, go.
I'm an unstoppable water-skiing machine.
Ta-da!
Oh, wait.
There's more.
How about if I heat things up?
Don't need nothin' but a good time
And it don't get better than this
Yogi!
Yogi, your cape.
I know.
It is magnificent.
And on fire.
Huh?
Fire!
- Turn the boat!
- Huh?
- Turn, Boo Boo!
- Hang on, Yogi!
Too much razzle!
- Nice one.
- Thanks.
Jump!
Let's go.
Out of my way!
This could not have gone more perfectly.
Hey, you got a little, uh...
Never mind.
Let's go.
Mr. Ranger, I thought...
Yogi, that's the problem.
All the thinking.
Hey, you know what would be great?
If you didn't think.
If you could just be a regular bear.
You know, sitting in the woods, minding his own business.
But no, you're different.
You're smart.
And you'd rather spend your days being selfish and destructive while everyone else pays the price.
But I guess it wasn't enough, screwing up my life.
No, this time you had to go and bring down this entire park.
So tell me, Yogi how smart are you now?
Hey, there!
That was quite a show you put on yesterday.
Ha-ha-ha.
I can't wait to see what you do with this.
That's your new assignment.
Evergreen Park.
Oh, I think you're just going to find it delightful.
Oh, and, uh, Ranger Jones is gonna be taking over here.
Ranger Jones?
Well, I have got a press conference to plan.
You see, it turns out I've saved the city.
Don't forget to vote, my friend.
Brown for governor!
Ha-ha-ha.
He's not gonna vote for me, is he?
Uh, no.
You did everything you could.
Doesn't matter.
This park needed a ranger who could make it popular again.
I'm just some guy who knows how old every tree is.
Fat lot of good that did Jellystone.
Face it.
You and I are just two people who care about things that nobody else does and that's why we're alone.
Or maybe that's why we found each other.
Did you ever think of that?
Rachel, you and this park have one thing in common.
You both deserve a better man than me.
I can't believe he's really gone.
Yogi, are you okay?
I'm done being special, Boo Boo.
Ranger Smith was right.
My whole life, I've been different.
But it's done nothing but hurt people.
The world would be better off if I was only as smart as the average bear.
Yogi, what are you doing?
I'm leaving, Boo Boo.
- I am going to forage for food in the wild.
- Huh?
Might even catch some fish.
With my paws.
I'm just gonna grab a little something for the road.
Some chips and soda.
And this.
Peach pie.
Any more of that casserole?
Top shelf.
I'll be out there.
Fending for myself.
Foraging for food in the wild.
Goodbye, horsepower limiter.
There's a new head ranger in town.
Let's see what you got.
Perfect.
I'm sorry, Ranger Smith.
No more food.
No more pic-a-nickers.
How could this get any worse?
Oh.
Ah, Evergreen Park.
Yes, it is simply delightful.
- Come on.
- I've got it, sir.
This is unbelievable.
Ah, Evergreen Park.
Lovely, isn't it?
This isn't a park.
I can barely breathe in here.
Look at these trees.
They're all plastic.
Oh, no, they're real.
It's just years of smog and pollution have left a plastic-like coating on them.
Think people will be happy you're closing the most beautiful park in the state?
Well, they will be when they find out it's making the city rich and giving each citizen a check for $1000.
How is that even possible?
Oh, well, it turns out that there has been some agricultural interest in the park.
And it's a lot more profitable than people in station wagons making s'mores.
Have a good day, Ranger Smith.
I hate this car.
I hate it.
Yeah!
Oh, hey, there he is.
Ha-ha-ha.
Whoa, hey, Mr. Mayor!
I, uh...
Just finishing some stamping.
You are doing great, Jones.
I knew you were the guy for this job.
Quick thing.
You'll probably notice some giant trucks rumbling by.
We're just clearing a little patch of trees for my press conference.
No big deal.
Um, wait, you're cutting down trees?
Oh, yeah.
Well, just a few.
It's nothing to worry about.
Actually gonna improve the park quite a bit.
I'll bet one of the first things you noticed as head ranger is that you need more clear spaces here, and you are absolutely right.
Now you can host concerts and Boy Scout jamborees.
That's a pretty smart move there, Head Ranger Jones.
I have some other park improvements I want to run by you.
Oh, splendid, yes.
I think I have a few moments to hear those.
Look into the security arrangements for tomorrow.
I don't want any surprises.
I'll hear what Ding-Dong has to say.
What do you got?
I'm hungrier than the average bear.
I wish I could find a bush that tasted like birthday cake.
Gotcha.
Pretend it's a gummy worm.
Pretend it's a gummy worm.
Yogi, I've been looking everywhere for you.
Not now, Boo Boo.
I'm busy foraging.
Come on, Yogi.
Jellystone is in trouble.
We need your help.
Nothing I can do, Boo Boo.
I'm average now.
My brain is out of business.
I wouldn't even be standing if my paws didn't hurt.
Quit feeling sorry for yourself.
You know you're not an average bear.
Hey, hey, Boo Boo.
You're right, I'm not.
I failed at that too.
Hey, come back here.
You've gotta save Jellystone.
What are you doing?
I'm not...
Yogi, you have to use your smarts for good.
And if you can't see that, maybe you are just an average bear.
Come on.
Now do you understand?
What's going on, Boo Boo?
I don't know.
But whatever it is I think they're just getting started.
Boo Boo get my collar.
Nobody is gonna hurt Jellystone.
Where are we going, Yogi?
We can't get Jellystone back alone, Boo Boo.
My thinker is good, but Ranger Smith's is better.
He was going to a place called Evergreen Park.
That's right.
In the city.
The city?
That's a long walk.
Don't be silly, Boo Boo.
I've already got a smarty-smart cheat to keep our feet off the street.
Get ready for it.
Here it comes.
Run, Boo Boo, run!
Hurry, Boo Boo.
I think we gotta jump for it.
Ready?
All aboard.
Good.
Yogi, grab my paw.
Sorry.
Boo Boo, Boo Boo, Boo Boo!
I gotta get...!
I guess it makes a stop here.
Yup.
Looks like Evergreen Park is about two miles away from here.
Two miles?
I'll have to tap into my emergency rations.
Snack break.
Come on, Yogi.
We need to keep moving.
It's not that far and it's all downhill.
Downhill?
Excuse me, Mr. Dirty Shopper.
Any chance my friend and I might borrow your wheely-basket?
Is that chocolate?
Okay, Boo Boo, keep it steady.
I'm okay, Ma.
Just...
Yeah, no, it's not Jellystone, but at least there's nothing here to drive me crazy.
- Hey, Mr. Ranger.
- Hey, Yogi.
All right, Ma, I gotta call you back.
What are you guys doing here?
We need your help, Mr. Ranger, sir.
But don't worry, my days of goofing things up for you are over.
Hey, move that shopping cart!
I'm okay!
I'm just gonna put this over here.
What do you want?
I don't have a life left for you to ruin anymore.
Sir, I know I messed things up and I'm sorry.
I never meant to.
You and Boo Boo are the best friends I ever had.
And I've never done anything but think of myself.
And now Jellystone is just gonna be a big field of stumps.
What?
They've started cutting down the trees.
"Agricultural interest" is logging.
Oh, no, not our Jellystone.
We have to save it, sir.
I don't think we can save it, Yogi.
I'm no smarter than you.
I lost Jellystone.
I lost Rachel.
It's over.
Mr. Ranger, I've learned two things from stealing pic-a-nic baskets.
Light mayonnaise is not nearly as good as regular mayonnaise.
You can't fail if you never stop trying.
You have to fight for the things you love whether it's a park, a girl or a roast beef sandwich.
Don't give up now.
We're all Jellystone's got.
You're right, Yogi.
Jellystone's too important to give up on.
We gotta try.
Come on.
- Shotgun.
- Aw.
I never thought I'd see this.
Happy 100th anniversary, Jellystone.
Isn't that Miss Movie Lady?
I gotta get in there.
You don't understand.
Let me in, please.
No can do.
Park is closed to the public until the press conference.
Mayor's orders.
Then go talk to him.
Tell him what I told you.
I'm sorry.
I don't really take orders from a...
I lived with gorillas, pal.
I know rage.
You do not want me to go gorilla on you.
Uh, I'll speak to the mayor.
- Thank you.
- Okay.
Rachel.
Ranger Smith.
I didn't think I'd ever see you again.
I know.
I don't know what I was thinking.
I think you're perfect.
I think any guy in the world would be lucky just to stand next to you.
You really mean that?
Of course I do.
It's just, when I lost Jellystone, I felt like such a failure.
But losing you has felt much, much worse.
I'm like...
I'm like a genus without a phylum.
That's the sweetest thing anyone's ever said to me.
- So, um, we're still here.
Mm-hm.
Oh, right.
Ahem.
So, what are you doing here?
- Come on, I'll show you.
- Okay.
I was reviewing the documentary footage from Boo Boo's camera and I saw this.
Oh, my.
I see it.
I have a bald spot back there!
I'm not talking about you, Yogi.
I'm talking about this.
Yeah, it's my pet turtle.
He hangs out at the cave all the time.
True.
You know they don't come out of that shell?
I tried one time to see what one would look like without it.
But, nope, they're sewn in.
This is no regular turtle.
See the bulging frog-like eyes and the really wide mouth?
A frog-mouthed turtle?
Yup, Rafetus swinhoei.
But those are extinct.
For a hundred years, but apparently one still exists.
And he lives in there.
But they won't let me through the gates to go find him.
But if Jellystone has an endangered species living in it, then...
It has to be protected as a park.
That's the law.
That turtle can save this park.
Now I feel kinda bad about using him as a foot stool.
You've seen the filmmaker?
Well, we spoke.
About extinct turtles.
You're telling me there is an extinct turtle living here in the park?
According to Miss Johnson's film, there is.
An extinct turtle?
That's great.
Visitors will come from miles around to see an endangered species.
Yes, they will, and that is great.
We need to find this turtle.
Just to keep it safe.
Have a vet check it out.
The whole deal.
The sooner we get to him the better.
Oh, we need a head ranger who's good enough to find it.
Someone who thinks like a turtle.
I am that head ranger.
Well, then why are you still here?
He's back.
Come on.
You need to let us in this park.
That turtle needs protection.
Don't worry about the turtle.
We're handling it.
We'll make sure he's put in a nice zoo.
No.
A turtle that's endangered can't be removed from its natural habitat.
It's against federal law.
It is?
Wow, I've never heard of that law in chapter 4, subsection 6 of the Wildlife Protection Mandate.
Don't worry, Mr. Ranger, sir.
That turtle is safe.
These people have no idea where my cave is.
The turtle's in the talking bear's cave.
Copy.
Wow, that backfired.
Okay.
You know what?
Fine,
You win.
What are you doing?
I have a plan.
One of the advantages of having lived here since I was a kid is I know this park like the back of my hand.
Let's go!
Hold on, boys.
All right.
Hey, there, little buddy.
Hello, there.
Uh-oh.
Sorry about that.
- Mayor Brown.
- This had better be good, Jones.
I found the turtle.
He was in Boo Boo's sleeping bag.
But now I have him secure at the picnic area.
Jones, you're a hero.
Sit tight.
My chief of staff is on his way to get him.
Copy that.
Head Ranger Jones over and out.
He found the turtle.
Dang it.
Can't cross those rapids.
There's no way to get to him from here.
Well, there is one way.
There it is.
My masterpiece.
- You really think you can pull this off?
- I know I can, sir.
I'm gonna snatch that basket-type turtle box and fly away like a fuzzy bird.
And I've got the best copilot a basket-snatching machine could have.
- I don't know how to fly this thing.
- Well, you'll pick it up as we go.
Okay.
Look, just be careful, okay, Yogi?
Copy that, ground control.
Basket-Nabber 2000 ready for takeoff.
- Flight systems check.
Boo Boo?
- What?
- Can you reach the pedals?
- Lf I point my toes.
Flight systems are go.
Remember what I told you about flying gliders, Yogi.
Don't fight the wind.
As long as the wind wants me to snatch up that turtle, we'll get along just fine.
- All right.
Start pedaling, Boo Boo.
All right.
Here goes.
Hold on, Boo Boo.
Fasten your seat belt.
But there isn't one.
Here we go!
Oh, Yogi!
The wind should carry you south!
We'll meet you there!
Take your time, Mr. Ranger.
This machine is equipped with landing gear.
We'll touch down as soft as a feather.
Whoops.
This is your captain speaking.
We'll reach our turtle target in about two minutes.
So let's go ahead and start the beverage service.
- Yogi, look out.
- Aah!
- Trees!
- Yes, trees!
I got it.
I got it.
I got it.
I don't got it!
Pull up.
- Hey!
- Pull up!
You did it, Yogi.
Oh.
Yeah.
Ha-ha-ha.
Great job, Jones.
I'll get this guy to the city zoo.
- The city zoo?
- Yep.
They got a nice spot ready in the reptile house.
The city zoo doesn't have a reptile house.
They're building one.
- Who is?
- Builders.
Sure you're trying to protect the turtle?
Yeah, we love turtles.
Then you won't mind if I hold onto him until I notify the Wildlife Federation, right?
All right.
You're gonna find this out in a few hours anyway, so I might as well tell you.
We gotta lose this turtle to sell logging rights to the park.
Logging?
The whole park?
Yeah, but who cares?
It's still a park, just without trees.
And they'll grow back.
Yeah, in like 200 years.
It doesn't matter.
Your career is what matters.
Ha-ha-ha.
Turtle target acquired.
I need 20 more feet of altitude.
Engage the hand pedals.
You couldn't put the hand pedals by you?
There's a suggestion box behind the seat, Boo Boo.
Wait, you don't want to approach him like that.
He's poisonous.
He's in a basket.
But he can spit.
Poison.
He'll aim at your eyes.
Melt them out of your head.
- I'm telling you, that turtle is deadly.
- What are you looking at?
- Hook me in, Boo Boo.
- Okay.
And fire!
Here you go.
Huh?
Yogi, wait!
Here I come!
He's going for the turtle.
- Mind if I borrow this?
- Hey!
Look, Boo Boo!
We got the turtle!
Hey, why aren't you in your seat?
That bear knows how to steal a basket.
Everybody after that glider now!
I'm not gonna let a bear make me look bad.
Been there, buddy.
We're drifting too far right.
I wanna get us outside the park.
Don't fight the wind, Yogi.
Remember what Miss Movie Lady said about...
Never mind.
Hang on, Boo Boo.
- What do we do now?
Did you check the safety manual?
It's just a picture of us screaming.
We've got to deject, Boo.
Don't you mean eject?
Eject is up.
Deject is down.
In case of emergency your seat can also be used as a flotation device!
Hey, told you.
Nothing to worry about.
I actually think I wasn't worried enough.
Let me see how our little passenger is doing.
Wonder why they call him a frog-mouthed turtle anyway?
Hey!
Hey, guys, over here!
Yogi, grab the branch.
Got you, Mr. Ranger, sir.
- Welcome aboard.
Yogi.
We were trying to get you off the raft.
Yeah, that makes more sense.
You guys did it.
You saved him.
Oh, no.
They're gonna catch us downstream.
I'm on it.
No, Yogi, don't.
Problem solved.
They can't catch us now.
Yeah, because now we are headed straight for the Jellyjarring Rapids.
- Grab a paddle.
- Tuck your head in, little buddy.
Brace yourselves.
Oh, come on, turtle.
Don't worry, I put safety belts in this raft for just such an occasion.
You better hang on.
Mr. Ranger said...
We're gonna be fine, Boo Boo.
Just sit back and let Mother Nature carry us to...
I think Mother Nature's kind of cranky today.
You okay, Yogi?
Fine!
Turtle!
Who's that?
I can't see.
Come here, turtle.
- Got him.
Good work, Boo Boo.
We made it through the rapids.
Yeah, but that means the falls are just up ahead.
Hold on!
Yogi.
Yogi.
Now who says there are no rides at Jellystone?
Yeah, you've definitely got the thrill part down.
Please, take your seats.
The press conference is about to begin.
That's over a mile away.
We're never gonna make that in time.
- Ranger Jones?
- I messed up pretty bad, sir.
- I know.
It's okay.
- I wanted to be head ranger.
Because you're a good head ranger and I value leadership.
I have a merit badge...
Can we talk later?
We're pressed for time.
Yes.
Get in.
Boo Boo!
Boo Boo!
Wait up!
Well, well.
Guess who we found.
Starts with T and ends with a..."Urtle"?
It's over.
Call off the logging.
The law says this park is now a protected nature preserve.
You think I care about what the law says?
Or about some endangered "frog-mouthed turtle"?
Or some stupid park for families to have a picnic in?
I care about power, you pinheads!
And I'm gonna get it.
Nobody knows this turtle exists.
And nobody ever will.
You found the turtle.
Get this thing out of here before anybody else sees it.
- Rachel!
- Oh!
Yogi!
Yogi, here!
Thank you.
- Yogi.
- I'm sorry.
He was open.
Ha, ha.
Now if you'll excuse me, I have a press conference.
I can still tell them what you did.
Oh, yeah?
Without that turtle or a scrap of evidence, go right ahead.
Well, you might as well tell them Bigfoot is here.
Ha-ha-ha.
And do yourself a favor, there, ranger.
Try to keep your dignity.
It's all you have left.
You know what?
I'm taking care of this thing myself this time.
That's the only way to make sure the job is done right.
But that's why I'm the mayor's right-hand man, right?
Because I don't make mistakes.
Hey, you know, people are wondering:
"Why should I vote for Mayor Brown to be governor?"
Well, how about this:
Mayor Brown just turned the city's budget from a deficit into a surplus!
And put $1000 into the pocket of every citizen of this city!
Now before I sign the paperwork that will save the city why don't you all take a look at my first campaign ad for governor?
Mayor Brown, the right choice for governor.
We're out of time.
Must be something we can do.
Anybody have any ideas?
Well, I guess this is going to be a pretty sad documentary, huh?
Are you...?
Is he still filming?
I needed more footage, so I told him to keep it rolling.
I can plug that into the video feed right up there.
I just need a way to distract the guards.
I think we can take care of that.
He supports public safety.
All right, hurry up, people.
Focus.
Let's go save those orphans.
Hey, hey, hey, check this out!
- Kick it, Boo Boo.
- Kicking it.
Don't stop believing
Hold on to that feeling
He's tough on crime.
Hey, hey, hey, look at this.
Keep your eye on the little bear.
Look at the skills.
Amazing!
And here's what Mayor Brown proudly has to say about protecting our natural resources.
You think I care about what the law says?
Or about some endangered "frog-mouthed turtle"?
- Some stupid park for families to picnic in?
- No.
No.
No.
I care about power, you pinheads!
Oh, boy.
Nobody knows this turtle exists.
And nobody ever will.
There's about to be a riot out there.
I need you out front.
Okay.
No.
Hey, wait.
Wait, wait, wait.
Please, please, please.
That was not real.
Trust me, there is no such thing as a frog-mouthed turtle.
He's right next to me, isn't he?
Okay.
- We did it, Yogi!
- Up high, Boo Boo!
- All right!
We got it!
Yogi!
All right, and now...
Miss Moviemaker Lady.
Hey, we did it.
Hey, Mr. Ranger!
Come on, Boo Boo.
- Okay.
I was wrong, Yogi.
I say from here on, we just be proud of who we are and fight for the things we're passionate about, like this park.
And Rachel.
And pic-a-nic baskets?
And pic-a-nic baskets.
- Aw, come here!
- No, you don't have to...
Okay.
All right, that's...
I'm good.
Here you go, Boo Boo.
Take good care of him.
Hey, there, buddy.
No, no, no, I never took a kickback on anything in my entire career.
No one loves turtles more than I do.
And nature in general.
I love trees.
Oh, no, you don't!
Gorilla?
Himalayan snow leopard.
Huh.
Welcome to Jellystone, home of the frog-mouthed turtle.
And brochures.
I'm Ranger Jones.
Ah, yes, Jellystone Park.
A wonderful little piece of paradise.
Where families come and soak up the tranquility of nature.
It's a place that...
Huh?
Never mind.
Hey, hey, hey!
Hi.
Welcome.
Well, I am certainly glad that you are gonna be staying in Jellystone for a while.
And what animal will you be observing?
Well, I thought I would observe the courting rituals of the American ranger.
I happen to hear the American ranger is a very charming intelligent, attractive species.
One that always keeps his cool.
Even when basket-stealing bears push his buttons?
Listen, Yogi will be Yogi.
And I'm just not gonna let it bother me anymore.
Besides I have more important things to focus on.
Oh...
I...
Let's...
Let's try that again.
Afternoon, Mr. Ranger, sir!
Hi, Miss Movie Lady!
Yogi!
I love this place.
Yogi!
Hey!
NARRATOR:
Jellystone Park.
One of the nation's oldest and most beautiful stretches of wilderness.
For years, families have headed out from the busy city eager to enjoy a little camping, fishing and, of course, observing the park's natural wildlife.
Boo Boo, I think it's time I introduced myself to that pic-a-nic basket.
You know, Yogi, we could just hunt for food.
All the other animals do.
Boo Boo, a pic-a-nic basket has everything a bear needs.
And I'm not just talking about the treats and snack-type goodies.
No.
A pic-a-nic basket holds a lot more than that.
It holds dreams.
[WHISPERING] What are we looking at?
I don't know.
Hook me in.
[IN NORMAL VOICE] You sure it'll work, Yogi?
Well, you know, Boo Boo, I'm smarter than the average bear!
[SHOUTING]
[CHUCKLING]
All right!
[GASPS]
[SHOUTING]
[GRUNTS]
[CHUCKLING]
[GROANS]
MAN:
Ranger Smith!
Sorry about that.
We got a 4-23 in Redwood Valley, sir.
- A what?
- A bear disturbance.
- I think it's probably...
- I know who it is.
Why didn't you just say "bear disturbance"?
Well, I...
Uh, well, it sounds cooler.
I mean, we're park rangers, sir.
You know:
"To protect and preserve."
Did you just make that motto up?
Yeah, I did.
Do you like it?
Ranger Jones, you know that, well, being a park ranger, it's not about mottos.
It's about keeping the park safe.
That's where the glory is.
Protecting all of this.
Yeah, I know.
Besides, that motto was still in the testing phase.
It's not like I made T-shirts or anything.
Heh, no, of course not.
Okay, I'm gonna deal with that 4-23.
Okay, copy that, sir.
Um, I'm actually gonna hop in the Armadillo, make some rounds.
Jones, you know that the Armadillo is for head ranger use only.
I might need it at any moment to deal with a park emergency.
Why don't you finish stacking those trail maps?
Yeah, sure.
Okay.
Yeah, because that's what future head rangers do, they stack maps.
Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy!
Our days of getting banged up to grab a meal are over, Boo Boo.
From now on, the pic-a-nic baskets are going to fall into our arms.
Soldering iron.
BOO BOO:
Here you go.
- Thank you.
Okay.
That should do it.
Test rock.
Okay, Yogi.
YOGI:
Weight sensor triggered.
Basket in position.
Launch spring starts coiling.
Firing pin drops.
And...
[BELL RINGS]
Bull's-eye!
I'm so smart it hurts!
You're standing on the soldering iron.
Or it's that.
[SHOUTING]
Hot, hot, hot!
There's the test rock.
Now we just wait here for a pic-a-nic basket to fall into our arms.
Are you sure about this, Yogi?
People seem to get pretty mad when you...
A genius never questions his instincts, Boo Boo.
When you have a mind like mine you can't blink or you'll put a kink in your think.
Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.
We've got our first customers.
And they have pie!
I wonder what kind it is.
SMITH:
Yogi, are you out here?
- It's Mr. Ranger.
- Aah!
Get rid of the test rock.
Destroy the evidence.
I was never here.
SMITH:
Look...
Ow!
Hello, Mr. Ranger, sir.
Did you just...?
Did you guys...?
Did you...?
Oh, never mind.
Look, there was a complaint about a bear interfering with a family picnic.
I see.
And you'd like us to mount some sort of investigation?
No, I think it was you.
What?
!
How can you even think that?
Are you feverish?
Let me press my lips against your forehead.
Wait!
You're not pressing your lips against my forehead.
Hey, it's a lot better than the way they take my temperature.
[CHUCKLES]
No, look, Yogi, we've been over this many times.
Bears are supposed to avoid people, not run around stealing their food.
I agree, sir.
That's why my friend Boo Boo and I would never think of disturbing a family's pic-a-nic.
[BELL RINGS AND WOOD CLUNKS]
[WOMAN SCREAMS]
Huh.
It missed.
[GROANS]
Good day, Mr. Ranger, sir.
We'll keep our eyes peeled.
I wonder if he noticed the pie.
JONES [CHOPPY OVER RADIO]:
Ra...
Smith.
You have a vis...
Over.
Didn't understand a word of that, Jones.
- Sorry.
Some lady's here to see you.
- Send her in.
- Okay.
I'll be in the Armadillo.
- Or you could be...
- Map stacking?
- Map stacking.
- Ranger Smith?
- Yes.
- Hello.
I'm Rachel Johnson.
- Hi.
I was hoping to talk to you about filming a documentary here.
Sure.
I can handle you for that.
Handle that for you.
Sorry.
My work isn't...
My brain isn't working right.
- I must have inhaled some jimsonweed.
- Oh.
Datura stramonium.
It's known to cause delirium cramping and nausea.
Heh.
- Cramping and nausea.
You've read The North American Wilderness Guide.
Yeah, I like to highlight all the plants and animals I see.
- I like to...
Me too.
- Ha, ha!
Yeah.
[SMITH STAMMERING]
Ranger Smith.
At your service.
You want to film a documentary in Jellystone?
Yes.
I sent you a letter about a month ago.
- Written on a piece of bark.
- That was you!
Yes.
I'm sorry about that.
I was in Sumatra, living among the orangutans at the time and they get very nervous if they spot anything from the modern world.
Really?
Wow, that's amazing.
Then what did you use for ink?
Bird poop and spit.
Impressive.
So, what are you here to film?
Well, I was hoping to shoot a local species.
Something to really capture the beauty of a national park.
Terrific.
What animal were you thinking?
I heard you had an unusual brown bear.
- Brown bear?
- Yes.
One that talks?
Those are so rare.
- None that I can think of.
- Named Yogi?
Wears a hat and a tie?
No, that doesn't ring a bell.
I think he's standing on the roof, trying to steal your lunchbox.
YOGI:
I smell PB and J.
[YOGI SHOUTING]
I'm all done.
Oh, right.
That Yogi.
Bankrupt?
No, no, no.
We're a city.
Cities don't go bankrupt.
They do when they're broke, sir.
We just have to find some money somewhere.
I'm about to run for governor.
How am I gonna do that when my own city is bankrupt?
Okay, yes.
Thank you.
- Here's the invoice, Mr. Mayor.
- Yikes!
Wow.
Ha.
I'm gonna pretend I didn't see that.
Just bill it to the city, okay?
Thank you.
Ugh.
How did we ever go so broke?
- I think we just spent too much.
- Hmm.
Is there anything we can sell?
You already sold the public golf course to condo developers two of the three fire stations to that frozen yogurt company.
You were selling the library, but it burned down.
Oh, yeah.
That was gonna be one of those make-your-own-doughnut places.
- No.
- Yeah.
- Lf you could dream it up, you could make it.
- Ah.
Love those.
We gotta think of something here.
Well, if we don't have anything to sell, maybe we can profit off what we can't sell.
I don't understand those words.
Like when we sold the bottling rights to the water in Lake Beuclair.
- We made a fortune.
- Yeah.
Sinkhole Beuclair is a great place to throw old mattresses.
- Oh, yeah.
- Hmm.
We just don't have any more resources to exploit.
Or do we?
Jellystone.
If we rezone Jellystone Park as agricultural land, we can sell the logging rights.
Here.
This company says they'll give us thousands of dollars an acre just to cut down the trees or something.
That'll be enough to balance the budget and give each citizen a big fat check.
[LAUGHING]
You have any idea how many votes that'll buy me?
- Enough to be the next governor?
- Exactly.
You're fine, Yogi.
It's just a few scrapes and bruises.
I don't know, Mr. Ranger.
I'm pretty sure I heard my spine snap.
Well, you wouldn't be able to stand.
And you wouldn't be able to eat.
I'm okay!
Yogi, Boo Boo, I would like to introduce you to Rachel Johnson who's here to make a nature documentary.
[GROWLS]
What the heck was that?
I was saying hello.
I lived in a den with brown bears for six months.
Only bear I've ever lived with is Boo Boo.
And he only makes that sound after he's eaten baked beans.
Heh, heh.
I have problems with baked beans.
And for a little bear, he makes a lot of stink.
Okay, I have some fantastic river otters you can film instead.
- Could get a hat and tie on the slow one.
- No, you know, I really, really like these two.
- Would you guys mind if I shoot you?
YOGI:
Huh?
[RAPID FOOTSTEPS]
Yogi, I think she meant with a camera.
Yes.
Of course with a camera.
Heh-heh-heh.
I knew that.
But not just any camera.
This isn't gonna make me look fat, is it?
RACHEL:
No, you are gonna look great.
Okay, just a few more adjustments.
[WHISPERING] Please, excuse the pre-tied bow tie.
My mornings are often rushed.
It's fine, Boo Boo.
This is going to be a whole new perspective for a documentary.
The Boo Boo cam will capture the true wilderness in all its natural glory.
No other human in sight.
That sounds like my apartment.
Ha, ha.
Uh, you know, because I live alone.
Well, plenty of women have tried to change that.
It's just, I haven't found one that...
- Likes you?
- What?
No.
No, that...
Will return your calls?
Can you stop helping, please?
Sir, I can see you like this lady.
But your courting rituals need work.
What you need to do is follow her around for two days making snorting sounds.
Then fight any male that looks at her.
And then, of course, urinate on her to mark her as your territory.
Works every time.
I got it under control, Yogi.
- Boo Boo, you're rolling.
- Cool.
Yogi Bear, a brown bear commonly found in North America and Alaska.
Weighing up to 1800 pounds, brown bears are also the national animal of Finland.
I don't think you have to narrate.
But I liked where you were going with it, Boo Boo.
- I was hooked.
- Really?
Yes.
Now try to film from flattering angles, if you know what I mean.
Pic-a-nic baskets may be delicious on the lips, but they're a lifetime on the hips.
Oh, no.
Ranger Smith!
Ranger Smith.
The mayor's here.
What's he doing here?
Why didn't he give us more warning?
I have to secure the area.
All units, lock down the park.
Repeat, lock down the park.
Jones, you know I'm the only other ranger here, right?
Yeah.
- Ranger Smith, we need to talk.
- You could've just called.
BROWN:
Yeah, but I thought this would be more friendly.
I'm really working on my people skills.
Anyway, I am closing your park down.
- Okay.
- What?
Oh, yeah, this place just costs the city way too much money.
Jellystone hasn't made its operating budget in 10 years.
You know, it's hard to compete with all those amusement parks...
Oh, hey, you're not kidding.
Oh, have you guys been to Lincoln Log Land yet?
Oh, man, they have got a roller coaster there, it's made completely out of logs.
It's just like they rode in the pioneer days.
It's unbelievable.
Sir, Jellystone is special.
Okay?
It's turning 100 years old this very year.
Why, it's a landmark.
I would never let it be closed down.
Well, uh, you actually don't have a choice.
Have you read the city bylaws lately?
Chapter 6.
Section 73.
"Any municipal property that can't generate enough money to cover its operating budget can be rezoned for other uses."
And since Jellystone loses money every year, we're shutting it down.
Uh, sorry?
[BOTH CHUCKLE]
- I thought that went well.
CHIEF:
Yeah.
SMITH:
Just a second, Mr. Mayor.
Who says we can't cover our budget?
Park doesn't report earnings till next quarter.
Yeah, which is like one week away.
Come on, Smith.
You gotta be $20,000 in the hole.
We wish.
Yeah.
Try 30,562.
That's probably a couple hundred extra for the map stand.
I think it's confession time.
- I only pretended to fix it.
- Thanks, Jones.
Sounds like you're in pretty deep there, Smith.
Maybe we are.
But this is one of the last places families can go to be close to nature.
The world needs that.
Well, I'm not mayor of the world.
I'm mayor of this city.
And this city needs this park rezoned.
I'm sorry.
I feel awful about it.
Even though I look really good.
This is a new suit.
So, okay.
Maybe we don't have our operating budget today.
But you know what?
- A lot can happen in a week.
- All right.
Have it your way.
Take a week.
Hey, I'll even get you started.
What's the admission fee for one car again?
Four dollars.
Four dollars, huh?
Four whole dollars?
Well, that changes everything.
Oh, my goodness.
Well, I only need to come back in here like, uh, what, 10,000 more times?
[LAUGHING]
In a week!
Do I have time for that?
- Impossible.
- Oh, shoot.
[WEIRD AL YANKOVIC'S "LASAGNA" PLAYING ON STEREO]
You want-a some-a lasagna?
You hungry, buddy?
Of course!
I'm always hungry.
I was talking to my pet turtle.
Here you go.
That better not be my beef jerky.
[TURTLE CHEWING]
[BELCHES]
So, what's the big deal, Yogi?
This is the big deal, Boo Boo.
It's my masterpiece.
The Basket-Nabber 2000.
The most advanced pic-a-nic basket-stealing technology ever invented.
Wow.
Climb aboard.
This glider can steer dive, shoot rubber bands at pesky-type birds and even has an air bag.
Had an air bag.
Sorry, Yogi.
Not to worry.
We could cushion our landing with all the pic-a-nic baskets we swipe.
Now, how's that copilot seat feel?
A little wobbly, like it's not tied on very tight.
You won't feel that in the air.
Get ready to fly faster than the speed of sandwich, Boo Boo.
We're gonna break the pic-a-nic barrier.
SMITH:
Yogi!
- Uh-oh.
That's not his happy voice.
Don't move.
I'm switching the glider into stealth mode.
Stealth mode?
Wow.
How are you able to...?
Oh.
Ah, Mr. Ranger, sir.
Welcome.
Can I interest you in a sody pop?
- There you go.
- When did you steal our vending machine?
I, um...
I'm repairing it, sir.
This machine gives its sodas away for free when a bear kicks it.
Look, a camper has reported some missing fishing poles so I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say it was you.
Fishing poles?
Sir, I'm a bear.
If I wanted to catch fish, I would just use my...
Your paws, Yogi.
Isn't that kind of unsanitary?
What's that?
- What's what?
- That thing.
- What thing?
- The thing under the blanket.
- Blanket?
- The object right behind you.
Oh.
Oh, that.
Heh.
A sculpture.
I'm sculpting now.
Mostly landscapes.
And where's Boo Boo?
- France.
- What?
- That's not close by, is it?
- No.
Then he's in the bathroom.
- Excuse me.
- Wait!
[STAMMERING]
Hey, this isn't the bathroom.
I'm telling you, Mr. Ranger, it's not for stealing pic-a-nic baskets.
It says "Basket-Nabber 2000" right here, Yogi.
I do regret calling it that now.
I know I'm always saying, "Stay away from the campers."
This is different.
Jellystone is in real trouble.
If I don't raise $30,000 in a week, this park's getting rezoned.
Rezoned?
What does that mean?
It means the park won't be a park anymore.
The city will use this land for something else.
So we have got to do everything we can to help save it.
Which means you have gotta stop stealing food so that campers will leave here happy.
But they do leave here happy.
Getting your food stolen by Yogi Bear is special.
People come here for that.
It's like catching a foul ball at a baseball game.
Nope.
It's like getting your food stolen at a baseball game.
Come on, Yogi.
Would it really be so hard to be a regular bear?
You know, to forage for food, to walk around on all fours to hibernate a little, or a lot.
If nature had meant for me to be a regular bear it wouldn't have given me such a good thought-cooker, sir.
I can't help it if my melon is full of smart juice.
Yogi, your melon is hurting this park.
There are repercussions to stealing people's picnic baskets.
Not in my experience, sir.
[MECHANISM TICKING]
[BELL RINGS]
[GRUNTS]
On the other hand...
[SCREAMS]
Ranger Smith, mind if I borrow the 'dilla?
It's an emergency.
Somebody parked without parking decals.
Jones, I would really prefer it if you focused on just maintaining the park instead.
Let me deal with the visitors until you've had more experience.
Sorry, sir.
Guess that's just the Eagle Scout in me, you know?
Always wanting to be in control, be a leader.
Live up to this fanny pack full of merit badges.
You know that fanny pack is for first aid supplies, right?
A merit badge in first aid is the only supply I need, sir.
Right, but it might not be the only supply a hurt person needs.
You seen Rachel?
Yeah, I saw her.
She was heading up to Lookout Mountain.
She can't be far.
I'll drive.
Let's roll.
Jones.
The sprawling beauty of Jellystone Park.
A timeless stretch of wilderness untouched by man.
Oh.
Ranger Smith.
Wow, heh.
What's with the fancy outfit?
Dress greens.
I always wear dress greens in the evening.
You know, in case there's, you know...
- I don't know how to talk to girls.
- Oh.
Why do you think I spend so much time with animals?
All you have to do is scratch their backside and you've got a friend for life.
Try that with people and all of a sudden you're the weird girl on the bus that nobody wants to sit next to.
Um, uh, listen.
I was wondering, you know, if you were...
I mean, it's getting late and we could, uh...
If you want.
I mean, it's not that...
You don't...
It's...
You know, it's not a worry.
Don't worry.
Did you just ask me to dinner?
Yes.
I did.
Heh.
- Good, you got that, huh?
- Yes.
I just thought, well, it's getting late.
I happen to know this great place.
- Very gourmet.
- Really?
Where?
So close you won't believe it.
Wow, how did you ever find this place?
This is a four-star porch.
And fresh from the hot plate, I give you rack of Spam.
- Oh.
Wow.
Maybe "gourmet" was a bit of a stretch.
No, it actually looks wonderful.
Great.
You know, this really is a peaceful place.
It's something, isn't it?
I pretty much grew up here.
My father was a ranger when I was a kid and he turned this park into the number one tourist destination in the state.
I mean, it was a park, you know?
Like families came by the hundreds swam in the streams, hiked on the trails.
It was really something.
This is really good.
Anyway, I don't know.
Maybe it's my fault.
I spent so many years learning everything I could about the park so I'd be a better ranger.
Maybe instead, I should have come up with a gimmick to get people to come here.
You know, change the name to Extreme Jellystone.
- I think that it's perfect just the way it is.
- You do?
You're right.
Absolutely.
There's no better place on earth.
YOGI:
Hey, Mr. Ranger.
- Except a place without him.
Evening, Mr. Ranger, sir.
Madame Moviemaker Lady.
And yes, I'm using the fancy tense to show you the utmost respect.
Hi.
Ha, ha.
What do you want, Yogi?
Well, I was thinking about the park's prickly predicament and I would like to do my part to help.
This is all the money I have saved.
Almost $100.
I was going to use it on myself, but I'd rather donate it to Jellystone.
Well, thank you, Yogi.
That's...
That is very sweet.
- Where does a bear get money from?
- That brown box by the parking lot.
The park donation box.
Yep.
But I want you to have it.
Consider it a gift to Jellystone.
That won't be hard.
Look, guys, I appreciate the effort.
But what this park needs is visitors and lots of them.
Well, I can help you there, sir.
Just make me a headliner.
I will rock this place.
- Kick it, Boo Boo.
- Kicking it.
[SIR MIX-A-LOT'S "BABY GOT BACK" PLAYING]
I like big butts and I cannot lie You other brothers can't deny
That when a girl walks in With a itty-bitty waist
And a round thing in your face You get sprung
[MUSIC STOPS]
That's not gonna work either, Yogi.
You're right.
We need something flashier than music.
Not a problem.
I've got this water-skiing routine that will change the face of entertainment.
Got a little of everything.
Music, stunts, magic.
- And I jump over Boo Boo at the end.
- No, you don't.
- I want to try it.
- I don't care.
I hate to interrupt, but you're not gonna water-ski or dance or do anything that might disturb the campers, okay?
If what you really want to do is help save this park you will lay low, stay away from people.
Think you can do that for me?
You have my word, Mr. Ranger.
I will be seen, but not heard.
Or seen.
Fine.
Huh?
You guys done with that Spam?
- Get out of here.
- Okay.
Sheesh!
Hey.
What's this?
Seasons pass applications.
Unfortunately, not a lot of takers on those.
Fifty bucks for an entire year?
Including camping fees?
That's a bargain.
If this were a place people wanted to visit throughout the year.
Maybe Yogi was on to something.
- You said the park was turning 100, right?
- Right.
Well, a big event could really pull people in.
Yeah, you're right.
We could have, like, a moss collection day or a big squirrel chase.
- Or...
- Fireworks.
Yes.
Exactly.
Why didn't I think of that?
We could host a big centennial festival.
People always show up for fireworks.
If even half of the people buy season passes the park makes enough money to stay open.
Right.
Let's get the word out.
I think I can help with that.
[PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY]
That is great.
How did we pay for it?
We didn't.
It was some fast-food restaurant but I rearranged the letters right before the plane took off.
[BOTH CHUCKLE]
You're very cool, Rachel Johnson.
You're pretty cool yourself.
I do have my own kind of natural swagger.
[SCREAMS]
Jellystone National Park, 100th year anniversary.
There'll be fireworks.
Just stay calm, Jones.
You should be patrolling in the Armadillo making park-impacting decisions, but...
- Hey, 100th year anniversary.
- Thanks.
But you're not there yet.
You still have to follow orders.
Even if those orders make you look like a giant Cheez-It.
Mr. Mayor!
Hi, Mr. Mayor.
Why is it only going halfway down again?
Doesn't make any...
No!
Oh, okay.
Is it a double tap or do I have to press it...?
- Oh, dang it!
- I got it, sir.
Yeah.
That's exactly what I did.
Let me see one of those fliers.
"Come celebrate Jellystone's 100th anniversary with fireworks and fun."
"And receive $10 off a season pass"?
He's gonna try to make the budget selling season passes.
[BOTH GROAN]
Yeah, ugh.
It's not a very good idea, in my opinion.
But nobody consulted me, because my job is just to maintain the park which is basically poking trash with a stick.
Yeah.
Yeah, why is a guy with your talent doing this insulting grunt work?
You should be running a park.
Yeah, but Ranger Smith says I have to pay my dues.
- Excuse me?
- What?
- He has to pay his dues?
Ha.
- Ha, ha.
Nobody pays dues anymore.
You gotta be in charge now while you still know everything.
- That's what I've been saying.
- Yeah.
Buddy, if it was up to me, you would be the head ranger of Jellystone already.
- You'd put me in charge?
- In a second.
Yes.
You know, if this centennial festival didn't work out, I probably could relocate Smith.
You know, uh, maybe you could help me with that.
Make sure it doesn't succeed?
Wait, you mean, like, sabotage it?
No.
Oh, no, no, no.
No, I want you to be head ranger.
It just so happens that the only way to do that is to bring down this festival.
But spend the rest of your life as second-in-command if you like.
That's fine.
It's a perfectly valid life choice.
Well, you just think about it and give me a call, okay?
Here's my card.
So long.
Hey.
Now why is it doing that?
No.
Boy Scouts are loyal, thrifty, kind...
Hey, you're back.
Hey, thanks for getting those fliers out.
Let me tell you, this festival is gonna be huge.
Hey, Ranger Smith, how long do you think until I reach head ranger status?
Oh, no time at all.
I did it in 12 short years.
Ha, okay.
Are you serious?
Just be patient, Jones.
It'll be here before you know it.
This festival's gonna be great!
I can't wait 12 years.
[PEOPLE CHEERING AND LAUGHING]
Seasons pass order forms.
Seasons pass order forms.
Thank you.
Seasons pass order forms, $10 off today.
Ah, enjoy.
I can't take it, Boo Boo.
Two days without a tasty treat to eat?
And I have to sit up here while they're having a "happy birthday, Jellystone" party?
[SNIFFING]
And they have doughnuts.
Doughnuts!
BOO BOO [OVER RADIO]:
Yogi, what are you doing?
- Yogi!
- I'm going.
Hey.
Wait.
Don't do it, Yogi.
You promised Mr. Ranger.
You're right.
I'm losing control, Boo Boo.
I don't know who's steering the ship.
Here.
I want you to handcuff me to this tree and not unlock it no matter what I say.
Okay, Yogi.
- Okay, unlock me.
- Huh?
It was a bad idea.
Unlock me.
[GRUNTING]
Unlock me!
[GROWLING]
Okay.
Here you go.
JONES:
Folks, I hate to say this, but there are no spots left.
Forecast called for thunderstorms.
Severe lightning.
I fear for your young ones.
[CAR HORN HONKING]
We're out of fireworks, I'm afraid.
It's just sparklers left.
Oh, no.
You look nice.
Your napkin matches your tie.
I don't need you to kiss up to me.
Got this guy for that.
That's a good point, sir.
You were gonna handle this situation, yet there are quite a few people here.
Sir, I tried.
All last night I spent taking down fliers.
I blocked the entrance with a vehicle to back up traffic.
I hung up "rabid squirrel" signs everywhere.
Those were hand-drawn.
- Nothing is working.
- You need to think of something, don't you?
Or maybe you're just not head ranger material.
Mr. Mayor.
Mayor's yes man.
So glad you could join us.
I saved you a nice spot next to the porta-potties.
Oh, well, thank you.
Well, that's very thoughtful.
You know, I'm just so glad that these festivities are going so well, Smith.
I just hope nothing goes wrong.
[HORN HONKING]
We are gonna pull this off, Jonesy.
I've seen hundreds of people filling out seasons pass order forms.
The weather's great.
The fireworks, ready to go.
Even Yogi's staying out of the way.
Yogi.
[GROANING]
Hey, guys.
Sorry, just wandering around, bored out of my mind.
Bored?
But the 100th anniversary extravaganza's going on.
Yeah, more like 100th anniversary lame-aganza.
You know, because it's so lame.
People see fireworks every day in the city.
They thought they'd see something different here.
I knew it.
I should be out there doing my water-ski routine.
I'm a shining star and Ranger Smith is holding me back.
I don't know, Yogi.
Mr. Ranger is usually right about these things.
No, Boo Boo, Ranger Smith is in denial.
I mean, he's lost it, you know?
I saw him a couple days ago.
He was filling his pockets with dirt.
He said he's gonna start moving the park to his apartment piece by piece.
- How big is his apartment?
- There's still time.
I won't be able to do the half-hour artistic program but that was more for me anyway.
These people need the razzle-dazzle.
I don't think we've practiced the razzle-dazzle.
You're not supposed to, Boo Boo.
That's where it gets the razzle.
Yogi, I really don't think we should...
Boo Boo, you've tried to stop my brilliant ideas with common sense a thousand times.
Has it ever worked?
No.
Then let's go, go, go.
What does that taste like?
Unemployment?
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah.
Thanks again for helping with the fireworks.
I don't know where Jones disappeared to.
My pleasure.
You know, um, Rachel, I've been wanting to tell you well, how much I...
- Ranger...
No, please, let me get through this.
I'm not very good with words.
But I have never felt so gushy.
Ha-ha-ha.
- You know?
- Ranger...
You know what I did?
I went and I wrote a song about you.
It's like this:
[HUMMING]
Oh, no.
[SINGING] I saw you at the station
Had a heart palpitation
My sickness was love And you're the medication
Rachel
- Rachel
- The microphone is on.
SMITH:
And it comes around again
Rachel, Rachel, Rachel
The microphone is on.
Yes, the mic...
[CLEARS THROAT THEN LAUGHS]
Hi.
Hello and welcome to the 100th anniversary of Jellystone!
[CHEERING]
Thank you.
It is so wonderful to see so many people here today.
I've noticed many of you filling out your seasons pass order forms.
We're more than happy to collect those after the fireworks.
But first, please, sit back, get comfortable and enjoy the show!
- Terrific.
- Mr. Mayor?
[POISON'S "NOTHIN' BUT A GOOD TIME" PLAYING ON STEREO]
That's not the right music.
I'll take it from here, Mr. Ranger!
Oh, no.
Full speed ahead, Boo Boo.
Okay.
Not bad, eh, Boo Boo?
Looking good, Yogi.
- This cannot be happening.
- Oh, it's happening.
[YOGI STAMMERING]
Hello, Jellystone!
[CROWD CHEERING]
No, don't encourage him!
They love me.
I can do no wrong.
Watch this.
All right, Boo Boo!
Turn up the heat!
Phase two, go.
I'm an unstoppable water-skiing machine.
[LAUGHING]
Ta-da!
Oh, wait.
There's more.
How about if I heat things up?
[SMITH WHIMPERS]
[GROANING]
Don't need nothin' but a good time
And it don't get better than this
Yogi!
Yogi, your cape.
I know.
It is magnificent.
And on fire.
Huh?
Fire!
[GROANING]
- Turn the boat!
- Huh?
- Turn, Boo Boo!
- Hang on, Yogi!
Too much razzle!

- Nice one.
- Thanks.

Hey, you got a little, uh...
Never mind.
Let's go.
[SIGHS]
[WOOD SNAPPING AND CREAKING]
Mr. Ranger, I thought...
Yogi, that's the problem.
All the thinking.
Hey, you know what would be great?
If you didn't think.
If you could just be a regular bear.
You know, sitting in the woods, minding his own business.
But no, you're different.
You're smart.
And you'd rather spend your days being selfish and destructive while everyone else pays the price.
But I guess it wasn't enough, screwing up my life.
No, this time you had to go and bring down this entire park.
So tell me, Yogi how smart are you now?
Hey, there!
That was quite a show you put on yesterday.
Ha-ha-ha.
I can't wait to see what you do with this.
That's your new assignment.
Evergreen Park.
Oh, I think you're just going to find it delightful.
Oh, and, uh, Ranger Jones is gonna be taking over here.
Ranger Jones?
Well, I have got a press conference to plan.
You see, it turns out I've saved the city.
Don't forget to vote, my friend.
Brown for governor!
Ha-ha-ha.
He's not gonna vote for me, is he?
Uh, no.
You did everything you could.
Doesn't matter.
This park needed a ranger who could make it popular again.
I'm just some guy who knows how old every tree is.
Fat lot of good that did Jellystone.
Face it.
You and I are just two people who care about things that nobody else does and that's why we're alone.
Or maybe that's why we found each other.
Did you ever think of that?
Rachel, you and this park have one thing in common.
You both deserve a better man than me.
I can't believe he's really gone.
Yogi, are you okay?
I'm done being special, Boo Boo.
Ranger Smith was right.
My whole life, I've been different.
But it's done nothing but hurt people.
The world would be better off if I was only as smart as the average bear.
Yogi, what are you doing?
I'm leaving, Boo Boo.
- I am going to forage for food in the wild.
- Huh?
Might even catch some fish.
With my paws.
[SIGHS]
I'm just gonna grab a little something for the road.
Some chips and soda.
And this.
Peach pie.
Any more of that casserole?
Top shelf.
I'll be out there.
Fending for myself.
Foraging for food in the wild.
[METAL CLANKING]
Goodbye, horsepower limiter.
There's a new head ranger in town.
Let's see what you got.
[GRUNTING]
Perfect.
[SOBBING]
I'm sorry, Ranger Smith.
No more food.
No more pic-a-nickers.
How could this get any worse?
[THUNDER BOOMING]
Oh.
Ah, Evergreen Park.
Yes, it is simply delightful.
[GIGGLING]
- Come on.
- I've got it, sir.
This is unbelievable.
Ah, Evergreen Park.
Lovely, isn't it?
This isn't a park.
I can barely breathe in here.
Look at these trees.
They're all plastic.
Oh, no, they're real.
It's just years of smog and pollution have left a plastic-like coating on them.
Think people will be happy you're closing the most beautiful park in the state?
Well, they will be when they find out it's making the city rich and giving each citizen a check for $1000.
How is that even possible?
Oh, well, it turns out that there has been some agricultural interest in the park.
And it's a lot more profitable than people in station wagons making s'mores.
[LAUGHING]
Have a good day, Ranger Smith.
I hate this car.
I hate it.
[GRUNTS]
[CHAINSAWS BUZZING]
Yeah!
Oh, hey, there he is.
Ha-ha-ha.
Whoa, hey, Mr. Mayor!
I, uh...
Just finishing some stamping.
You are doing great, Jones.
I knew you were the guy for this job.
Quick thing.
You'll probably notice some giant trucks rumbling by.
We're just clearing a little patch of trees for my press conference.
No big deal.
Um, wait, you're cutting down trees?
Oh, yeah.
Well, just a few.
It's nothing to worry about.
Actually gonna improve the park quite a bit.
I'll bet one of the first things you noticed as head ranger is that you need more clear spaces here, and you are absolutely right.
Now you can host concerts and Boy Scout jamborees.
That's a pretty smart move there, Head Ranger Jones.
I have some other park improvements I want to run by you.
Oh, splendid, yes.
I think I have a few moments to hear those.
Look into the security arrangements for tomorrow.
I don't want any surprises.
I'll hear what Ding-Dong has to say.
What do you got?
I'm hungrier than the average bear.
I wish I could find a bush that tasted like birthday cake.
Gotcha.
[GROANS]
Pretend it's a gummy worm.
Pretend it's a gummy worm.
[GASPS]
Yogi, I've been looking everywhere for you.
Not now, Boo Boo.
I'm busy foraging.
[GROANS]
[SHOUTS]
Come on, Yogi.
Jellystone is in trouble.
We need your help.
Nothing I can do, Boo Boo.
I'm average now.
My brain is out of business.
I wouldn't even be standing if my paws didn't hurt.
Quit feeling sorry for yourself.
You know you're not an average bear.
Hey, hey, Boo Boo.
You're right, I'm not.
I failed at that too.
Hey, come back here.
You've gotta save Jellystone.
YOGI:
What are you doing?
I'm not...
Yogi, you have to use your smarts for good.
And if you can't see that, maybe you are just an average bear.
Come on.
[GRUNTING]
Now do you understand?
What's going on, Boo Boo?
I don't know.
But whatever it is I think they're just getting started.
Boo Boo get my collar.
Nobody is gonna hurt Jellystone.
Where are we going, Yogi?
We can't get Jellystone back alone, Boo Boo.
My thinker is good, but Ranger Smith's is better.
He was going to a place called Evergreen Park.
That's right.
In the city.
The city?
That's a long walk.
Don't be silly, Boo Boo.
I've already got a smarty-smart cheat to keep our feet off the street.
Get ready for it.
Here it comes.
Run, Boo Boo, run!
Hurry, Boo Boo.
I think we gotta jump for it.
Ready?
All aboard.
Good.
Yogi, grab my paw.
[GROANING]
[GRUNTING]
Sorry.

Boo Boo, Boo Boo, Boo Boo!
I gotta get...!
I guess it makes a stop here.
Yup.
Looks like Evergreen Park is about two miles away from here.
Two miles?
I'll have to tap into my emergency rations.
Snack break.
Come on, Yogi.
We need to keep moving.
It's not that far and it's all downhill.
Downhill?
Excuse me, Mr. Dirty Shopper.
Any chance my friend and I might borrow your wheely-basket?
Is that chocolate?
[YOGI AND BOO BOO LAUGHING]
Okay, Boo Boo, keep it steady.
I'm okay, Ma.
Just...
Yeah, no, it's not Jellystone, but at least there's nothing here to drive me crazy.
- Hey, Mr. Ranger.
- Hey, Yogi.
[CART CRASHES]
All right, Ma, I gotta call you back.
What are you guys doing here?
We need your help, Mr. Ranger, sir.
But don't worry, my days of goofing things up for you are over.
MAN:
Hey, move that shopping cart!
[SHOUTING]
I'm okay!
I'm just gonna put this over here.
What do you want?
I don't have a life left for you to ruin anymore.
Sir, I know I messed things up and I'm sorry.
I never meant to.
You and Boo Boo are the best friends I ever had.
And I've never done anything but think of myself.
And now Jellystone is just gonna be a big field of stumps.
What?
They've started cutting down the trees.
"Agricultural interest" is logging.
Oh, no, not our Jellystone.
We have to save it, sir.
I don't think we can save it, Yogi.
I'm no smarter than you.
I lost Jellystone.
I lost Rachel.
It's over.
Mr. Ranger, I've learned two things from stealing pic-a-nic baskets.
One:
Light mayonnaise is not nearly as good as regular mayonnaise.
And two:
You can't fail if you never stop trying.
You have to fight for the things you love whether it's a park, a girl or a roast beef sandwich.
Don't give up now.
We're all Jellystone's got.
You're right, Yogi.
Jellystone's too important to give up on.
We gotta try.
Come on.
- Shotgun.
- Aw.
I never thought I'd see this.
Happy 100th anniversary, Jellystone.
Isn't that Miss Movie Lady?
RACHEL:
I gotta get in there.
You don't understand.
Let me in, please.
No can do.
Park is closed to the public until the press conference.
Mayor's orders.
Then go talk to him.
Tell him what I told you.
I'm sorry.
I don't really take orders from a...
I lived with gorillas, pal.
I know rage.
You do not want me to go gorilla on you.
[SCREAMS]
Uh, I'll speak to the mayor.
- Thank you.
- Okay.
Rachel.
Ranger Smith.
I didn't think I'd ever see you again.
I know.
I don't know what I was thinking.
I think you're perfect.
I think any guy in the world would be lucky just to stand next to you.
You really mean that?
Of course I do.
It's just, when I lost Jellystone, I felt like such a failure.
But losing you has felt much, much worse.
I'm like...
I'm like a genus without a phylum.
That's the sweetest thing anyone's ever said to me.
- So, um, we're still here.
YOGI:
Mm-hm.
Oh, right.
Ahem.
So, what are you doing here?
- Come on, I'll show you.
- Okay.
I was reviewing the documentary footage from Boo Boo's camera and I saw this.
Oh, my.
I see it.
I have a bald spot back there!
I'm not talking about you, Yogi.
I'm talking about this.
Yeah, it's my pet turtle.
He hangs out at the cave all the time.
True.
You know they don't come out of that shell?
I tried one time to see what one would look like without it.
But, nope, they're sewn in.
This is no regular turtle.
See the bulging frog-like eyes and the really wide mouth?
A frog-mouthed turtle?
Yup, Rafetus swinhoei.
SMITH:
But those are extinct.
For a hundred years, but apparently one still exists.
And he lives in there.
But they won't let me through the gates to go find him.
But if Jellystone has an endangered species living in it, then...
It has to be protected as a park.
That's the law.
That turtle can save this park.
Now I feel kinda bad about using him as a foot stool.
CHIEF:
You've seen the filmmaker?
Well, we spoke.
About extinct turtles.
You're telling me there is an extinct turtle living here in the park?
According to Miss Johnson's film, there is.
An extinct turtle?
That's great.
Visitors will come from miles around to see an endangered species.
Yes, they will, and that is great.
We need to find this turtle.
Just to keep it safe.
Have a vet check it out.
The whole deal.
The sooner we get to him the better.
Oh, we need a head ranger who's good enough to find it.
Someone who thinks like a turtle.
I am that head ranger.
Well, then why are you still here?
He's back.
Come on.
You need to let us in this park.
That turtle needs protection.
Don't worry about the turtle.
We're handling it.
We'll make sure he's put in a nice zoo.
No.
A turtle that's endangered can't be removed from its natural habitat.
It's against federal law.
It is?
Wow, I've never heard of that law in chapter 4, subsection 6 of the Wildlife Protection Mandate.
Don't worry, Mr. Ranger, sir.
That turtle is safe.
These people have no idea where my cave is.
The turtle's in the talking bear's cave.
JONES [OVER RADIO]:
Copy.
Wow, that backfired.
Okay.
You know what?
Fine,
You win.
What are you doing?
I have a plan.
One of the advantages of having lived here since I was a kid is I know this park like the back of my hand.
Let's go!
Hold on, boys.
All right.
Hey, there, little buddy.
Hello, there.
Uh-oh.
Sorry about that.
- Mayor Brown.
- This had better be good, Jones.
JONES:
I found the turtle.
He was in Boo Boo's sleeping bag.
But now I have him secure at the picnic area.
Jones, you're a hero.
Sit tight.
My chief of staff is on his way to get him.
Copy that.
Head Ranger Jones over and out.
SMITH:
He found the turtle.
Dang it.
Can't cross those rapids.
There's no way to get to him from here.
Well, there is one way.
There it is.
My masterpiece.
- You really think you can pull this off?
- I know I can, sir.
I'm gonna snatch that basket-type turtle box and fly away like a fuzzy bird.
And I've got the best copilot a basket-snatching machine could have.
- I don't know how to fly this thing.
- Well, you'll pick it up as we go.
SMITH:
Okay.
Look, just be careful, okay, Yogi?
Copy that, ground control.
Basket-Nabber 2000 ready for takeoff.
- Flight systems check.
Boo Boo?
- What?
- Can you reach the pedals?
- Lf I point my toes.
Flight systems are go.
Remember what I told you about flying gliders, Yogi.
Don't fight the wind.
As long as the wind wants me to snatch up that turtle, we'll get along just fine.
- All right.
YOGI:
Start pedaling, Boo Boo.
All right.
Here goes.
YOGI:
Hold on, Boo Boo.
Fasten your seat belt.
But there isn't one.
YOGI:
Here we go!
BOO BOO:
Oh, Yogi!
The wind should carry you south!
We'll meet you there!
Take your time, Mr. Ranger.
This machine is equipped with landing gear.
We'll touch down as soft as a feather.
Whoops.
This is your captain speaking.
We'll reach our turtle target in about two minutes.
So let's go ahead and start the beverage service.
- Yogi, look out.
- Aah!
- Trees!
- Yes, trees!
[BOTH SCREAMING]
I got it.
I got it.
I got it.
I don't got it!
BOO BOO:
Pull up.
- Hey!
- Pull up!
You did it, Yogi.
Oh.
Yeah.
Ha-ha-ha.
Great job, Jones.
I'll get this guy to the city zoo.
- The city zoo?
- Yep.
They got a nice spot ready in the reptile house.
The city zoo doesn't have a reptile house.
They're building one.
- Who is?
- Builders.
Sure you're trying to protect the turtle?
Yeah, we love turtles.
Then you won't mind if I hold onto him until I notify the Wildlife Federation, right?
All right.
You're gonna find this out in a few hours anyway, so I might as well tell you.
We gotta lose this turtle to sell logging rights to the park.
Logging?
The whole park?
Yeah, but who cares?
It's still a park, just without trees.
And they'll grow back.
Yeah, in like 200 years.
It doesn't matter.
Your career is what matters.
Ha-ha-ha.
Turtle target acquired.
I need 20 more feet of altitude.
Engage the hand pedals.
You couldn't put the hand pedals by you?
There's a suggestion box behind the seat, Boo Boo.
[GROANS]
Wait, you don't want to approach him like that.
He's poisonous.
He's in a basket.
But he can spit.
Poison.
He'll aim at your eyes.
Melt them out of your head.
- I'm telling you, that turtle is deadly.
- What are you looking at?
- Hook me in, Boo Boo.
- Okay.
And fire!
Here you go.
Huh?
Yogi, wait!
Here I come!
He's going for the turtle.
- Mind if I borrow this?
- Hey!
[YOGI LAUGHS]
Look, Boo Boo!
We got the turtle!
Hey, why aren't you in your seat?
That bear knows how to steal a basket.
Everybody after that glider now!
I'm not gonna let a bear make me look bad.
Been there, buddy.
We're drifting too far right.
I wanna get us outside the park.
Don't fight the wind, Yogi.
Remember what Miss Movie Lady said about...
Never mind.
YOGI:
Hang on, Boo Boo.
- What do we do now?
Did you check the safety manual?
It's just a picture of us screaming.
[BOTH SCREAMING]
We've got to deject, Boo.
Don't you mean eject?
Eject is up.
Deject is down.
In case of emergency your seat can also be used as a flotation device!
[YOGI LAUGHING]
[GRUNTING]
Hey, told you.
Nothing to worry about.
I actually think I wasn't worried enough.
Let me see how our little passenger is doing.
Wonder why they call him a frog-mouthed turtle anyway?
Hey!
SMITH:
Hey, guys, over here!
Yogi, grab the branch.
Got you, Mr. Ranger, sir.
[SMITH AND RACHEL GRUNT]
- Welcome aboard.
SMITH:
Yogi.
We were trying to get you off the raft.
Yeah, that makes more sense.
You guys did it.
You saved him.
[CAR HORN HONKS]
Oh, no.
They're gonna catch us downstream.
I'm on it.
No, Yogi, don't.
Problem solved.
They can't catch us now.
Yeah, because now we are headed straight for the Jellyjarring Rapids.
[GRUNTS]
- Grab a paddle.
- Tuck your head in, little buddy.
Brace yourselves.
Oh, come on, turtle.
Don't worry, I put safety belts in this raft for just such an occasion.
You better hang on.
Mr. Ranger said...
YOGI:
We're gonna be fine, Boo Boo.
Just sit back and let Mother Nature carry us to...
[ALL SCREAMING]
I think Mother Nature's kind of cranky today.
You okay, Yogi?
Fine!
Turtle!
YOGI:
Who's that?
I can't see.
Come here, turtle.
- Got him.
SMITH:
Good work, Boo Boo.
We made it through the rapids.
Yeah, but that means the falls are just up ahead.
Hold on!
[SCREAMING]
Yogi.
Yogi.
Now who says there are no rides at Jellystone?
Yeah, you've definitely got the thrill part down.
ANNOUNCER:
Please, take your seats.
The press conference is about to begin.
That's over a mile away.
We're never gonna make that in time.
[ALL GASP]
- Ranger Jones?
- I messed up pretty bad, sir.
- I know.
It's okay.
- I wanted to be head ranger.
Because you're a good head ranger and I value leadership.
I have a merit badge...
Can we talk later?
We're pressed for time.
Yes.
Get in.
[SIREN WAILING]
YOGI:
Boo Boo!
Boo Boo!
Wait up!
SMITH:
Well, well.
Guess who we found.
Starts with T and ends with a..."Urtle"?
It's over.
Call off the logging.
The law says this park is now a protected nature preserve.
You think I care about what the law says?
Or about some endangered "frog-mouthed turtle"?
Or some stupid park for families to have a picnic in?
I care about power, you pinheads!
And I'm gonna get it.
Nobody knows this turtle exists.
And nobody ever will.
You found the turtle.
Get this thing out of here before anybody else sees it.
- Rachel!
- Oh!
Yogi!
BOO BOO:
Yogi, here!
Thank you.
- Yogi.
- I'm sorry.
He was open.
Ha, ha.
Now if you'll excuse me, I have a press conference.
I can still tell them what you did.
Oh, yeah?
Without that turtle or a scrap of evidence, go right ahead.
Well, you might as well tell them Bigfoot is here.
Ha-ha-ha.
And do yourself a favor, there, ranger.
Try to keep your dignity.
It's all you have left.
You know what?
I'm taking care of this thing myself this time.
That's the only way to make sure the job is done right.
But that's why I'm the mayor's right-hand man, right?
Because I don't make mistakes.
Hey, you know, people are wondering:
"Why should I vote for Mayor Brown to be governor?"
Well, how about this:
Mayor Brown just turned the city's budget from a deficit into a surplus!
And put $1000 into the pocket of every citizen of this city!
Now before I sign the paperwork that will save the city why don't you all take a look at my first campaign ad for governor?
ANNOUNCER:
Mayor Brown, the right choice for governor.
We're out of time.
Must be something we can do.
Anybody have any ideas?
Well, I guess this is going to be a pretty sad documentary, huh?
Are you...?
Is he still filming?
I needed more footage, so I told him to keep it rolling.
I can plug that into the video feed right up there.
I just need a way to distract the guards.
I think we can take care of that.
ANNOUNCER:
He supports public safety.
[JOURNEY'S "DON'T STOP BELIEVING" PLAYING ON TV]
All right, hurry up, people.
Focus.
Let's go save those orphans.
YOGI:
Hey, hey, hey, check this out!
- Kick it, Boo Boo.
- Kicking it.
Don't stop believing
[LAUGHING]
Hold on to that feeling
ANNOUNCER:
He's tough on crime.
[SHOUTS]
Hey, hey, hey, look at this.
Keep your eye on the little bear.
Look at the skills.
Amazing!
[GRUNTING]
ANNOUNCER:
And here's what Mayor Brown proudly has to say about protecting our natural resources.
[MUSIC STOPS]
You think I care about what the law says?
Or about some endangered "frog-mouthed turtle"?
- Some stupid park for families to picnic in?
- No.
No.
No.
I care about power, you pinheads!
Oh, boy.
Nobody knows this turtle exists.
And nobody ever will.
[BOOING AND JEERING]
[LAUGHING]
There's about to be a riot out there.
I need you out front.
[GRUNTS]
Okay.
No.
Hey, wait.
Wait, wait, wait.
Please, please, please.
That was not real.
Trust me, there is no such thing as a frog-mouthed turtle.
He's right next to me, isn't he?
Okay.
- We did it, Yogi!
- Up high, Boo Boo!
- All right!
JONES:
We got it!
Yogi!
All right, and now...
Miss Moviemaker Lady.
SMITH:
Hey, we did it.
[LAUGHING]
Hey, Mr. Ranger!
RACHEL:
Come on, Boo Boo.
- Okay.
I was wrong, Yogi.
I say from here on, we just be proud of who we are and fight for the things we're passionate about, like this park.
And Rachel.
And pic-a-nic baskets?
And pic-a-nic baskets.
- Aw, come here!
- No, you don't have to...
Okay.
All right, that's...
I'm good.
[CROWD CHATTERING]
RACHEL:
Here you go, Boo Boo.
Take good care of him.
Hey, there, buddy.
No, no, no, I never took a kickback on anything in my entire career.
No one loves turtles more than I do.
And nature in general.
I love trees.
Oh, no, you don't!
[GROWLS]
Gorilla?
Himalayan snow leopard.
Huh.
Welcome to Jellystone, home of the frog-mouthed turtle.
And brochures.
I'm Ranger Jones.
NARRATOR:
Ah, yes, Jellystone Park.
A wonderful little piece of paradise.
Where families come and soak up the tranquility of nature.
It's a place that...
[MACHINE WHIRRING]
Huh?
Never mind.
MAN:
Hey, hey, hey!
[CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY]
Hi.
Welcome.
Well, I am certainly glad that you are gonna be staying in Jellystone for a while.
And what animal will you be observing?
Well, I thought I would observe the courting rituals of the American ranger.
I happen to hear the American ranger is a very charming intelligent, attractive species.
One that always keeps his cool.
Even when basket-stealing bears push his buttons?
Listen, Yogi will be Yogi.
And I'm just not gonna let it bother me anymore.
Besides I have more important things to focus on.
Oh...
[LAUGHING]
I...
Let's...
Let's try that again.
[HORN HONKING]
[GASPING]
Afternoon, Mr. Ranger, sir!
Hi, Miss Movie Lady!
[BARKING]
Yogi!
I love this place.
SMITH:
Yogi!
Hey!
[English

Encoded by ripper
NARRATOR:
Jellystone Park.
One of the nation's oldest and most beautiful stretches of wilderness.
For years, families have headed out from the busy city eager to enjoy a little camping, fishing and, of course, observing the park's natural wildlife.
Boo Boo, I think it's time I introduced myself to that pic-a-nic basket.
You know, Yogi, we could just hunt for food.
All the other animals do.
Boo Boo, a pic-a-nic basket has everything a bear needs.
And I'm not just talking about the treats and snack-type goodies.
No.
A pic-a-nic basket holds a lot more than that.
It holds dreams.
[whispering] What are we looking at?
I don't know.
Hook me in.
[IN NORMAL VOICE] You sure it'll work, Yogi?
Well, you know, Boo Boo, I'm smarter than the average bear!
[SHOUTING]
[chuckling]
All right!
[GASPS]
[SHOUTING]
[GRUNTS]
[chuckling]
[GROANS]
MAN:
Ranger Smith!
Sorry about that.
We got a 4-23 in Redwood Valley, sir.
-A what?
-A bear disturbance.
-l think it's probably-- -l know who it is.
Why didn't you just say "bear disturbance"?
Well, I....
Uh, well, it sounds cooler.
I mean, we're park rangers, sir.
You know:
"To protect and preserve."
Did you just make that motto up?
Yeah, I did.
Do you like it?
Ranger Jones, you know that, well, being a park ranger, it's not about mottos.
It's about keeping the park safe.
That's where the glory is.
Protecting all of this.
Yeah, I know.
Besides, that motto was still in the testing phase.
It's not like I made T-shirts or anything.
Heh, no, of course not.
Okay, I'm gonna deal with that 4-23.
Okay, copy that, sir.
Um, I'm actually gonna hop in the Armadillo, make some rounds.
Jones, you know that the Armadillo is for head ranger use only.
I might need it at any moment to deal with a park emergency.
Why don't you finish stacking those trail maps?
Yeah, sure.
Okay.
Yeah, because that's what future head rangers do, they stack maps.
Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy!
Our days of getting banged up to grab a meal are over, Boo Boo.
From now on, the pic-a-nic baskets are going to fall into our arms.
Soldering iron.
BOO BOO:
Here you go.
-Thank you.
Okay.
That should do it.
Test rock.
Okay, Yogi.
YOGI:
Weight sensor triggered.
Basket in position.
Launch spring starts coiling.
Firing pin drops.
And....
[BELL RINGS]
Bull's-eye!
I'm so smart it hurts!
You're standing on the soldering iron.
Or it's that.
[SHOUTING]
Hot, hot, hot!
There's the test rock.
Now we just wait here for a pic-a-nic basket to fall into our arms.
Are you sure about this, Yogi?
People seem to get pretty mad when you--
A genius never questions his instincts, Boo Boo.
When you have a mind like mine you can't blink or you'll put a kink in your think.
Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.
We've got our first customers.
And they have pie!
I wonder what kind it is.
smith:
Yogi, are you out here?
-lt's Mr. Ranger.
-Aah!
Get rid of the test rock.
Destroy the evidence. I was never here.
smith:
Look-
- Ow!
Hello, Mr. Ranger, sir.
Did you just--?
Did you guys--?
Did you--?
Oh, never mind.
Look, there was a complaint about a bear interfering with a family picnic.
I see.
And you'd like us to mount some sort of investigation?
No, I think it was you.
What?
!
How can you even think that?
Are you feverish?
Let me press my lips against your forehead.
Wait!
You're not pressing your lips against my forehead.
Hey, it's a lot better than the way they take my temperature.
[CHUCKLES]
No, look, Yogi, we've been over this many times.
Bears are supposed to avoid people, not run around stealing their food.
I agree, sir.
That's why my friend Boo Boo and I would never think of disturbing a family's pic-a-nic.
[BELL RINGS AND WOOD CLUNKS]
[WOMAN SCREAMS]
Huh.
It missed.
[GROANS]
Good day, Mr. Ranger, sir.
We'll keep our eyes peeled.
I wonder if he noticed the pie.
JONES [CHOPPY OVER RADIO]:
Ra-
- Smith.
You have a vis-
- Over.
Didn't understand a word of that, Jones.
-Sorry.
Some lady's here to see you.
-Send her in.
-Okay.
I'll be in the Armadillo.
-Or you could be....
-Map stacking?
-Map stacking.
-Ranger Smith?
-Yes.
-Hello. I'm Rachel Johnson.
-Hi.
I was hoping to talk to you about filming a documentary here.
Sure. I can handle you for that.
Handle that for you.
Sorry.
My work isn't-- My brain isn't working right.
-l must have inhaled some jimsonweed.
-Oh.
Datura stramonium.
It's known to cause delirium...
-...cramping and nausea.
Heh.
-Cramping and nausea.
You've read The North American Wilderness Guide.
Yeah, I like to highlight all the plants and animals I see.
-l like to-
- Me too.
-Ha, ha!
Yeah.
[smith STAMMERING]
Ranger Smith.
At your service.
You want to film a documentary in Jellystone?
Yes.
I sent you a letter about a month ago.
-Written on a piece of bark.
-That was you!
Yes. I'm sorry about that.
I was in Sumatra, living among the orangutans at the time and they get very nervous if they spot anything from the modern world.
Really?
Wow, that's amazing.
Then what did you use for ink?
Bird poop and spit.
Impressive.
So, what are you here to film?
Well, I was hoping to shoot a local species.
Something to really capture the beauty of a national park.
Terrific.
What animal were you thinking?
I heard you had an unusual brown bear.
-Brown bear?
-Yes.
One that talks?
Those are so rare.
-None that I can think of.
-Named Yogi?
Wears a hat and a tie?
No, that doesn't ring a bell.
I think he's standing on the roof, trying to steal your lunchbox.
YOGI:
I smell PB and J.
[YOGI shouting]
I'm all done.
Oh, right.
That Yogi.
Bankrupt?
No, no, no.
We're a city.
Cities don't go bankrupt.
They do when they're broke, sir.
We just have to find some money somewhere.
I'm about to run for governor.
How am I gonna do that when my own city is bankrupt?
Okay, yes.
Thank you.
-Here's the invoice, Mr. Mayor.
-Yikes!
Wow.
Ha.
I'm gonna pretend I didn't see that.
Just bill it to the city, okay?
Thank you.
Ugh.
How did we ever go so broke?
-l think we just spent too much.
-Hmm.
Is there anything we can sell?
You already sold the public golf course to condo developers two of the three fire stations to that frozen yogurt company.
You were selling the library, but it burned down.
Oh, yeah.
That was gonna be one of those make-your-own-doughnut places.
-No.
-Yeah.
-lf you could dream it up, you could make it.
-Ah.
Love those.
We gotta think of something here.
Well, if we don't have anything to sell, maybe we can profit off what we can't sell.
I don't understand those words.
Like when we sold the bottling rights to the water in Lake Beuclair.
-We made a fortune.
-Yeah.
Sinkhole Beuclair is a great place to throw old mattresses.
-Oh, yeah.
-Hmm.
We just don't have any more resources to exploit.
Or do we?
Jellystone.
If we rezone Jellystone Park as agricultural land, we can sell the logging rights.
Here.
This company says they'll give us thousands of dollars an acre just to cut down the trees or something.
That'll be enough to balance the budget and give each citizen a big fat check.
[laughing]
You have any idea how many votes that'll buy me?
-Enough to be the next governor?
-Exactly.
You're fine, Yogi.
It's just a few scrapes and bruises.
I don't know, Mr. Ranger.
I'm pretty sure I heard my spine snap.
Well, you wouldn't be able to stand.
And you wouldn't be able to eat.
I'm okay!
Yogi, Boo Boo, I would like to introduce you to Rachel Johnson who's here to make a nature documentary.
[GROWLS]
What the heck was that?
I was saying hello.
I lived in a den with brown bears for six months.
Only bear I've ever lived with is Boo Boo.
And he only makes that sound after he's eaten baked beans.
Heh, heh.
I have problems with baked beans.
And for a little bear, he makes a lot of stink.
Okay, I have some fantastic river otters you can film instead.
-Could get a hat and tie on the slow one.
-No, you know, I really, really like these two.
-Would you guys mind if I shoot you?
YOGI:
Huh?
[rapid FOOTSTEPS]
Yogi, I think she meant with a camera.
Yes.
Of course with a camera.
Heh-heh-heh.
I knew that.
But not just any camera.
This isn't gonna make me look fat, is it?
RACHEL:
No, you are gonna look great.
Okay, just a few more adjustments.
[whispering] Please, excuse the pre-tied bow tie.
My mornings are often rushed.
It's fine, Boo Boo.
This is going to be a whole new perspective for a documentary.
The Boo Boo cam will capture the true wilderness in all its natural glory.
No other human in sight.
That sounds like my apartment.
Ha, ha.
Uh, you know, because I live alone.
Well, plenty of women have tried to change that.
It's just, I haven't found one that--
-Likes you?
-What?
No.
No, that--
Will return your calls?
Can you stop helping, please?
Sir, I can see you like this lady.
But your courting rituals need work.
What you need to do is follow her around for two days making snorting sounds.
Then fight any male that looks at her.
And then, of course, urinate on her to mark her as your territory.
Works every time.
I got it under control, Yogi.
-Boo Boo, you're rolling.
-Cool.
Yogi Bear, a brown bear commonly found in North America and Alaska.
Weighing up to 1 800 pounds, brown bears are also the national animal of Finland.
I don't think you have to narrate.
But I liked where you were going with it, Boo Boo.
-l was hooked.
-Really?
Yes.
Now try to film from flattering angles, if you know what I mean.
Pic-a-nic baskets may be delicious on the lips, but they're a lifetime on the hips.
Oh, no.
Ranger Smith!
Ranger Smith.
The mayor's here.
What's he doing here?
Why didn't he give us more warning?
I have to secure the area.
All units, lock down the park.
Repeat, lock down the park.
Jones, you know I'm the only other ranger here, right?
Yeah.
-Ranger Smith, we need to talk.
-You could've just called.
BROWN:
Yeah, but I thought this would be more friendly.
I'm really working on my people skills.
Anyway, I am closing your park down.
-Okay.
-What?
Oh, yeah, this place just costs the city way too much money.
Jellystone hasn't made its operating budget in 1 0 years.
You know, it's hard to compete with all those amusement parks--
Oh, hey, you're not kidding.
Oh, have you guys been to Lincoln Log Land yet?
Oh, man, they have got a roller coaster there, it's made completely out of logs.
It's just like they rode in the pioneer days.
It's unbelievable.
Sir, Jellystone is special.
Okay?
It's turning 1 00 years old this very year.
Why, it's a landmark.
I would never let it be closed down.
Well, uh, you actually don't have a choice.
Have you read the city bylaws lately?
Chapter 6.
Section 73.
"Any municipal property that can't generate enough money to cover its operating budget can be rezoned for other uses."
And since Jellystone loses money every year, we're shutting it down.
Uh, sorry?
[BOTH CHUCKLE]
-l thought that went well.
CHIEF:
Yeah.
smith:
Just a second, Mr. Mayor.
Who says we can't cover our budget?
Park doesn't report earnings till next quarter.
Yeah, which is like one week away.
Come on, Smith.
You gotta be $20,000 in the hole.
We wish.
Yeah.
Try 30,562.
That's probably a couple hundred extra for the map stand.
I think it's confession time.
-l only pretended to fix it.
-Thanks, Jones.
Sounds like you're in pretty deep there, Smith.
Maybe we are.
But this is one of the last places families can go to be close to nature.
The world needs that.
Well, I'm not mayor of the world.
I'm mayor of this city.
And this city needs this park rezoned.
I'm sorry.
I feel awful about it.
Even though I look really good.
This is a new suit.
So, okay.
Maybe we don't have our operating budget today.
But you know what?
-A lot can happen in a week.
-All right.
Have it your way.
Take a week.
Hey, I'll even get you started.
What's the admission fee for one car again?
Four dollars.
Four dollars, huh?
Four whole dollars?
Well, that changes everything.
Oh, my goodness.
Well, I only need to come back in here like, uh, what, 1 0,000 more times?
[laughing]
In a week!
Do I have time for that?
-lmpossible.
-Oh, shoot.
[WEIRD AL yankovic'S "LASAGNA" playing ON STEREO]
You want-a some-a lasagna?
You hungry, buddy?
Of course!
I'm always hungry.
I was talking to my pet turtle.
Here you go.
That better not be my beefjerky.
[TURTLE chewing]
[BELCHES]
So, what's the big deal, Yogi?
This is the big deal, Boo Boo.
It's my masterpiece.
The Basket-Nabber 2000.
The most advanced pic-a-nic basket-stealing technology ever invented.
Wow.
Climb aboard.
This glider can steer dive, shoot rubber bands at pesky-type birds and even has an air bag.
Had an air bag.
Sorry, Yogi.
Not to worry.
We could cushion our landing with all the pic-a-nic baskets we swipe.
Now, how's that copilot seat feel?
A little wobbly, like it's not tied on very tight.
You won't feel that in the air.
Get ready to fly faster than the speed of sandwich, Boo Boo.
We're gonna break the pic-a-nic barrier.
smith:
Yogi!
-Uh-oh.
That's not his happy voice.
Don't move.
I'm switching the glider into stealth mode.
Stealth mode?
Wow.
How are you able to--?
Oh.
Ah, Mr. Ranger, sir.
Welcome.
Can I interest you in a sody pop?
-There you go.
-When did you steal our vending machine?
I, um-- l'm repairing it, sir.
This machine gives its sodas away for free when a bear kicks it.
Look, a camper has reported some missing fishing poles so I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say it was you.
Fishing poles?
Sir, I'm a bear.
If I wanted to catch fish, I would just use my....
Your paws, Yogi.
Isn't that kind of unsanitary?
What's that?
-What's what?
-That thing.
-What thing?
-The thing under the blanket.
-Blanket?
-The object right behind you.
Oh.
Oh, that.
Heh.
A sculpture.
I'm sculpting now.
Mostly landscapes.
And where's Boo Boo?
-France.
-What?
-That's not close by, is it?
-No.
Then he's in the bathroom.
-Excuse me.
-Wait!
[STAMMERlNG]
Hey, this isn't the bathroom.
I'm telling you, Mr. Ranger, it's not for stealing pic-a-nic baskets.
It says "Basket-Nabber 2000" right here, Yogi.
I do regret calling it that now.
I know I'm always saying, "Stay away from the campers."
This is different.
Jellystone is in real trouble.
If I don't raise $30,000 in a week, this park's getting rezoned.
Rezoned?
What does that mean?
It means the park won't be a park anymore.
The city will use this land for something else.
So we have got to do everything we can to help save it.
Which means you have gotta stop stealing food so that campers will leave here happy.
But they do leave here happy.
Getting your food stolen by Yogi Bear is special.
People come here for that.
It's like catching a foul ball at a baseball game.
Nope.
It's like getting your food stolen at a baseball game.
Come on, Yogi.
Would it really be so hard to be a regular bear?
You know, to forage for food, to walk around on all fours to hibernate a little, or a lot.
If nature had meant for me to be a regular bear it wouldn't have given me such a good thought-cooker, sir.
I can't help it if my melon is full of smart juice.
Yogi, your melon is hurting this park.
There are repercussions to stealing people's picnic baskets.
Not in my experience, sir.
[MECHANISM ticking]
[BELL RINGS]
[GRUNTS]
On the other hand--
[SCREAMS]
Ranger Smith, mind if I borrow the 'dilla?
It's an emergency.
Somebody parked without parking decals.
Jones, I would really prefer it if you focused on just maintaining the park instead.
Let me deal with the visitors until you've had more experience.
Sorry, sir.
Guess that's just the Eagle Scout in me, you know?
Always wanting to be in control, be a leader.
Live up to this fanny pack full of merit badges.
You know that fanny pack is for first aid supplies, right?
A merit badge in first aid is the only supply I need, sir.
Right, but it might not be the only supply a hurt person needs.
You seen Rachel?
Yeah, I saw her.
She was heading up to Lookout Mountain.
She can't be far. I'll drive.
Let's roll.
Jones.
The sprawling beauty of Jellystone Park.
A timeless stretch of wilderness untouched by man.
Oh.
Ranger Smith.
Wow, heh.
What's with the fancy outfit?
Dress greens.
I always wear dress greens in the evening.
You know, in case there's, you know- l don't know how to talk to girls.
-Oh.
Why do you think I spend so much time with animals?
All you have to do is scratch their backside and you've got a friend for life.
Try that with people and all of a sudden you're the weird girl on the bus that nobody wants to sit next to.
Um, uh, listen. I was wondering, you know, if you were--
I mean, it's getting late and we could, uh-- If you want.
I mean, it's not that-
- You don't-
- It's--
You know, it's not a worry.
Don't worry.
Did you just ask me to dinner?
Yes. I did.
Heh.
-Good, you got that, huh?
-Yes.
I just thought, well, it's getting late.
I happen to know this great place.
-Very gourmet.
-Really?
Where?
So close you won't believe it.
Wow, how did you ever find this place?
This is a four-star porch.
And fresh from the hot plate, I give you...
-...rack of Spam.
-Oh.
Wow.
Maybe "gourmet" was a bit of a stretch.
No, it actually looks wonderful.
Great.
You know, this really is a peaceful place.
It's something, isn't it?
I pretty much grew up here.
My father was a ranger when I was a kid and he turned this park into the number one tourist destination in the state.
I mean, it was a park, you know?
Like families came by the hundreds swam in the streams, hiked on the trails.
It was really something.
This is really good.
Anyway, I don't know.
Maybe it's my fault.
I spent so many years learning everything I could about the park so I'd be a better ranger.
Maybe instead, I should have come up with a gimmick to get people to come here.
You know, change the name to Extreme Jellystone.
-l think that it's perfect just the way it is.
-You do?
You're right.
Absolutely.
There's no better place on earth.
YOGI:
Hey, Mr. Ranger.
-Except a place without him.
Evening, Mr. Ranger, sir.
Madame Moviemaker Lady.
And yes, I'm using the fancy tense to show you the utmost respect.
Hi.
Ha, ha.
What do you want, Yogi?
Well, I was thinking about the park's prickly predicament and I would like to do my part to help.
This is all the money I have saved.
Almost $1 00.
I was going to use it on myself, but I'd rather donate it to Jellystone.
Well, thank you, Yogi.
That's--
That is very sweet.
-Where does a bear get money from?
-That brown box by the parking lot.
The park donation box.
Yep.
But I want you to have it.
Consider it a gift to Jellystone.
That won't be hard.
Look, guys, I appreciate the effort.
But what this park needs is visitors and lots of them.
Well, I can help you there, sir.
Just make me a headliner.
I will rock this place.
-Kick it, Boo Boo.
-Kicking it.
[SIR MlX-A-LOT'S "BABY GOT BACK" playing]
I like big butts and I cannot lie You other brothers can't deny
That when a girl walks in With a itty-bitty waist
And a round thing in your face You get sprung
[music STOPS]
That's not gonna work either, Yogi.
You're right.
We need something flashier than music.
Not a problem.
I've got this water-skiing routine that will change the face of entertainment.
Got a little of everything.
Music, stunts, magic.
-And I jump over Boo Boo at the end.
-No, you don't.
-l want to try it.
-l don't care.
I hate to interrupt, but you're not gonna water-ski or dance or do anything that might disturb the campers, okay?
If what you really want to do is help save this park you will lay low, stay away from people.
Think you can do that for me?
You have my word, Mr. Ranger.
I will be seen, but not heard.
Or seen.
Fine.
Huh?
You guys done with that Spam?
-Get out of here.
-Okay.
Sheesh!
Hey.
What's this?
Seasons pass applications.
Unfortunately, not a lot of takers on those.
Fifty bucks for an entire year?
Including camping fees?
That's a bargain.
If this were a place people wanted to visit throughout the year.
Maybe Yogi was on to something.
-You said the park was turning 1 00, right?
-Right.
Well, a big event could really pull people in.
Yeah, you're right.
We could have, like, a moss collection day or a big squirrel chase.
-Or....
-Fireworks.
Yes.
Exactly.
Why didn't I think of that?
We could host a big centennial festival.
People always show up for fireworks.
If even half of the people buy season passes the park makes enough money to stay open.
Right.
Let's get the word out.
I think I can help with that.
[PEOPLE chattering INDISTINCTLY]
That is great.
How did we pay for it?
We didn't.
It was some fast-food restaurant but I rearranged the letters right before the plane took off.
[BOTH CHUCKLE]
You're very cool, Rachel Johnson.
You're pretty cool yourself.
I do have my own kind of natural swagger.
[SCREAMS]
Jellystone National Park, 1 00th year anniversary.
There'll be fireworks.
Just stay calm, Jones.
You should be patrolling in the Armadillo making park-impacting decisions, but--
-Hey, 1 00th year anniversary.
-Thanks.
But you're not there yet.
You still have to follow orders.
Even if those orders make you look like a giant Cheez-It.
Mr. Mayor!
Hi, Mr. Mayor.
Why is it only going halfway down again?
Doesn't make any-
- No!
Oh, okay. ls it a double tap or do I have to press it--?
-Oh, dang it!
-l got it, sir.
Yeah.
That's exactly what I did.
Let me see one of those fliers.
"Come celebrate Jellystone's 1 00th anniversary with fireworks and fun."
"And receive $1 0 off a season pass"?
He's gonna try to make the budget selling season passes.
[BOTH GROAN]
Yeah, ugh. lt's not a very good idea, in my opinion.
But nobody consulted me, because my job is just to maintain the park which is basically poking trash with a stick.
Yeah.
Yeah, why is a guy with your talent doing this insulting grunt work?
You should be running a park.
Yeah, but Ranger Smith says I have to pay my dues.
-Excuse me?
-What?
-He has to pay his dues?
Ha.
-Ha, ha.
Nobody pays dues anymore.
You gotta be in charge now while you still know everything.
-That's what I've been saying.
-Yeah.
Buddy, if it was up to me, you would be the head ranger of Jellystone already.
-You'd put me in charge?
-ln a second.
Yes.
You know, if this centennial festival didn't work out, I probably could relocate Smith.
You know, uh, maybe you could help me with that.
Make sure it doesn't succeed?
Wait, you mean, like, sabotage it?
No.
Oh, no, no, no.
No, I want you to be head ranger.
It just so happens that the only way to do that is to bring down this festival.
But spend the rest of your life as second-in-command if you like.
That's fine.
It's a perfectly valid life choice.
Well, you just think about it and give me a call, okay?
Here's my card.
So long.
Hey.
Now why is it doing that?
No.
Boy Scouts are loyal, thrifty, kind....
Hey, you're back.
Hey, thanks for getting those fliers out.
Let me tell you, this festival is gonna be huge.
Hey, Ranger Smith, how long do you think until I reach head ranger status?
Oh, no time at all.
I did it in 1 2 short years.
Ha, okay.
Are you serious?
Just be patient, Jones.
It'll be here before you know it.
This festival's gonna be great!
I can't wait 1 2 years.
[PEOPLE CHEERING AND LAUGHING]
Seasons pass order forms.
Seasons pass order forms.
Thank you.
Seasons pass order forms, $1 0 off today.
Ah, enjoy.
I can't take it, Boo Boo.
Two days without a tasty treat to eat?
And I have to sit up here while they're having a "happy birthday, Jellystone" party?
[sniffing]
And they have doughnuts.
Doughnuts!
BOO BOO [OVER radio]:
Yogi, what are you doing?
-Yogi!
-l'm going.
Hey.
Wait.
Don't do it, Yogi.
You promised Mr. Ranger.
You're right. I'm losing control, Boo Boo.
I don't know who's steering the ship.
Here.
I want you to handcuff me to this tree and not unlock it no matter what I say.
Okay, Yogi.
-Okay, unlock me.
-Huh?
It was a bad idea.
Unlock me.
[GRUNTlNG]
Unlock me!
[growling]
Okay.
Here you go.
JONES:
Folks, I hate to say this, but there are no spots left.
Forecast called for thunderstorms.
Severe lightning.
I fear for your young ones.
[CAR HORN honking]
We're out of fireworks, I'm afraid.
It's just sparklers left.
Oh, no.
You look nice.
Your napkin matches your tie.
I don't need you to kiss up to me.
Got this guy for that.
That's a good point, sir.
You were gonna handle this situation, yet there are quite a few people here.
Sir, I tried.
All last night I spent taking down fliers.
I blocked the entrance with a vehicle to back up traffic.
I hung up "rabid squirrel" signs everywhere.
Those were hand-drawn.
-Nothing is working.
-You need to think of something, don't you?
Or maybe you're just not head ranger material.
Mr. Mayor.
Mayor's yes man.
So glad you could join us.
I saved you a nice spot next to the porta-potties.
Oh, well, thank you.
Well, that's very thoughtful.
You know, I'm just so glad that these festivities are going so well, Smith.
I just hope nothing goes wrong.
[HORN honking]
We are gonna pull this off, Jonesy.
I've seen hundreds of people filling out seasons pass order forms.
The weather's great.
The fireworks, ready to go.
Even Yogi's staying out of the way.
Yogi.
[GROANING]
Hey, guys.
Sorry, just wandering around, bored out of my mind.
Bored?
But the 1 00th anniversary extravaganza's going on.
Yeah, more like 1 00th anniversary lame-aganza.
You know, because it's so lame.
People see fireworks every day in the city.
They thought they'd see something different here.
I knew it.
I should be out there doing my water-ski routine.
I'm a shining star and Ranger Smith is holding me back.
I don't know, Yogi.
Mr. Ranger is usually right about these things.
No, Boo Boo, Ranger Smith is in denial.
I mean, he's lost it, you know?
I saw him a couple days ago.
He was filling his pockets with dirt.
He said he's gonna start moving the park to his apartment piece by piece.
-How big is his apartment?
-There's still time.
I won't be able to do the half-hour artistic program but that was more for me anyway.
These people need the razzle-dazzle.
I don't think we've practiced the razzle-dazzle.
You're not supposed to, Boo Boo.
That's where it gets the razzle.
Yogi, I really don't think we should--
Boo Boo, you've tried to stop my brilliant ideas with common sense a thousand times.
Has it ever worked?
No.
Then let's go, go, go.
What does that taste like?
Unemployment?
-l'm sorry.
-Yeah.
Thanks again for helping with the fireworks.
I don't know where Jones disappeared to.
My pleasure.
You know, um, Rachel, I've been wanting to tell you...
-...well, how much I--
-Ranger--
No, please, let me get through this.
I'm not very good with words.
But I have never felt so gushy.
Ha-ha-ha.
-You know?
-Ranger--
You know what I did?
I went and I wrote a song about you.
It's like this:
[humming]
Oh, no.
[singing] I saw you at the station
Had a heart palpitation
My sickness was love And you're the medication
Rachel
-Rachel
-The microphone is on.
smith:
And it comes around again
Rachel, Rachel, Rachel
The microphone is on.
Yes, the mic--
[CLEARS THROAT THEN LAUGHS]
Hi.
Hello and welcome to the 1 00th anniversary of Jellystone!
[cheering]
Thank you.
It is so wonderful to see so many people here today.
I've noticed many of you filling out your seasons pass order forms.
We're more than happy to collect those after the fireworks.
But first, please, sit back, get comfortable and enjoy the show!
-Terrific.
-Mr.
Mayor?
[POISON'S "nothin' BUT A GOOD time" playing ON STEREO]
That's not the right music.
I'll take it from here, Mr. Ranger!
Oh, no.
Full speed ahead, Boo Boo.
Okay.
Not bad, eh, Boo Boo?
Looking good, Yogi.
-This cannot be happening.
-Oh, it's happening.
[YOGI STAMMERING]
Hello, Jellystone!
[CROWD CHEERING]
No, don't encourage him!
They love me. I can do no wrong.
Watch this.
All right, Boo Boo!
Turn up the heat!
Phase two, go.
I'm an unstoppable water-skiing machine.
[laughing]
Ta-da!
Oh, wait.
There's more.
How about if I heat things up?
[smith WHlMPERS]
[GROANING]
Don't need nothin' but a good time
And it don't get better than this

Yogi, your cape.
I know.
It is magnificent.
And on fire.
Huh?
Fire!
[GROANING]
-Turn the boat!
-Huh?
-Turn, Boo Boo!
-Hang on, Yogi!
Too much razzle!
[CROWD screaming]

-Nice one.
-Thanks.

[ALL GASP]
[MURMURlNG]
Let's go.
[screaming AND SHOUTING]
MAN:
Out of my way!
[chuckling]
This could not have gone more perfectly.
Hey, you got a little, uh....
Never mind.
Let's go.
[SIGHS]
[WOOD snapping AND CREAKING]
Mr. Ranger, I thought--
Yogi, that's the problem.
All the thinking.
Hey, you know what would be great?
If you didn't think.
If you could just be a regular bear.
You know, sitting in the woods, minding his own business.
But no, you're different.
You're smart.
And you'd rather spend your days being selfish and destructive while everyone else pays the price.
But I guess it wasn't enough, screwing up my life.
No, this time you had to go and bring down this entire park.
So tell me, Yogi how smart are you now?
Hey, there!
That was quite a show you put on yesterday.
Ha-ha-ha.
I can't wait to see what you do with this.
That's your new assignment.
Evergreen Park.
Oh, I think you're just going to find it delightful.
Oh, and, uh, Ranger Jones is gonna be taking over here.
Ranger Jones?
Well, I have got a press conference to plan.
You see, it turns out I've saved the city.
Don't forget to vote, my friend.
Brown for governor!
Ha-ha-ha.
He's not gonna vote for me, is he?
Uh, no.
You did everything you could.
Doesn't matter.
This park needed a ranger who could make it popular again.
I'm just some guy who knows how old every tree is.
Fat lot of good that did Jellystone.
Face it.
You and I are just two people who care about things that nobody else does and that's why we're alone.
Or maybe that's why we found each other.
Did you ever think of that?
Rachel, you and this park have one thing in common.
You both deserve a better man than me.
I can't believe he's really gone.
Yogi, are you okay?
I'm done being special, Boo Boo.
Ranger Smith was right.
My whole life, I've been different.
But it's done nothing but hurt people.
The world would be better off if I was only as smart as the average bear.
Yogi, what are you doing?
I'm leaving, Boo Boo.
-l am going to forage for food in the wild.
-Huh?
Might even catch some fish.
With my paws.
[SIGHS]
I'm just gonna grab a little something for the road.
Some chips and soda.
And this.
Peach pie.
Any more of that casserole?
Top shelf.
I'll be out there.
Fending for myself.
Foraging for food in the wild.
[METAL CLANKING]
Goodbye, horsepower limiter.
There's a new head ranger in town.
Let's see what you got.
[GRUNTlNG]
Perfect.
[sobbing]
I'm sorry, Ranger Smith.
No more food.
No more pic-a-nickers.
How could this get any worse?
[THUNDER booming]
Oh.
Ah, Evergreen Park.
Yes, it is simply delightful.
[giggling]
-Come on.
-l've got it, sir.
This is unbelievable.
Ah, Evergreen Park.
Lovely, isn't it?
This isn't a park.
I can barely breathe in here.
Look at these trees.
They're all plastic.
Oh, no, they're real.
It's just years of smog and pollution have left a plastic-like coating on them.
Think people will be happy you're closing the most beautiful park in the state?
Well, they will be when they find out it's making the city rich and giving each citizen a check for $1 000.
How is that even possible?
Oh, well, it turns out that there has been some agricultural interest in the park.
And it's a lot more profitable than people in station wagons making s'mores.
[laughing]
Have a good day, Ranger Smith.
I hate this car. I hate it.
[GRUNTS]
[CHAINSAWS buzzing]
Yeah!
Oh, hey, there he is.
Ha-ha-ha.
Whoa, hey, Mr. Mayor!
I, uh....
Just finishing some stamping.
You are doing great, Jones.
I knew you were the guy for this job.
Quick thing.
You'll probably notice some giant trucks rumbling by.
We're just clearing a little patch of trees for my press conference.
No big deal.
Um, wait, you're cutting down trees?
Oh, yeah.
Well, just a few.
It's nothing to worry about.
Actually gonna improve the park quite a bit.
I'll bet one of the first things you noticed as head ranger is that you need more clear spaces here, and you are absolutely right.
Now you can host concerts and Boy Scout jamborees.
That's a pretty smart move there, Head Ranger Jones.
I have some other park improvements I want to run by you.
Oh, splendid, yes.
I think I have a few moments to hear those.
Look into the security arrangements for tomorrow.
I don't want any surprises.
I'll hear what Ding-Dong has to say.
What do you got?
I'm hungrier than the average bear.
I wish I could find a bush that tasted like birthday cake.
Gotcha.
[GROANS]
Pretend it's a gummy worm.
Pretend it's a gummy worm.
[GASPS]
Yogi, I've been looking everywhere for you.
Not now, Boo Boo.
I'm busy foraging.
[GROANS]
[SHOUTS]
Come on, Yogi.
Jellystone is in trouble.
We need your help.
Nothing I can do, Boo Boo.
I'm average now.
My brain is out of business.
I wouldn't even be standing if my paws didn't hurt.
Quit feeling sorry for yourself.
You know you're not an average bear.
Hey, hey, Boo Boo.
You're right, I'm not.
I failed at that too.
Hey, come back here.
You've gotta save Jellystone.
YOGI:
What are you doing?
I'm not--
Yogi, you have to use your smarts for good.
And if you can't see that, maybe you are just an average bear.
Come on.
[GRUNTlNG]
Now do you understand?
What's going on, Boo Boo?
I don't know.
But whatever it is I think they're just getting started.
Boo Boo get my collar.
Nobody is gonna hurt Jellystone.
Where are we going, Yogi?
We can't get Jellystone back alone, Boo Boo.
My thinker is good, but Ranger Smith's is better.
He was going to a place called Evergreen Park.
That's right. ln the city.
The city?
That's a long walk.
Don't be silly, Boo Boo.
I've already got a smarty-smart cheat to keep our feet off the street.
Get ready for it.
Here it comes.
Run, Boo Boo, run!
Hurry, Boo Boo.
I think we gotta jump for it.
Ready?
All aboard.
Good.
Yogi, grab my paw.
[GROANING]
[GRUNTlNG]
Sorry.
[YOGI shouting]
Boo Boo, Boo Boo, Boo Boo!
I gotta get--!
I guess it makes a stop here.
Yup.
Looks like Evergreen Park is about two miles away from here.
Two miles?
I'll have to tap into my emergency rations.
Snack break.
Come on, Yogi.
We need to keep moving.
It's not that far and it's all downhill.
Downhill?
Excuse me, Mr. Dirty Shopper.
Any chance my friend and I might borrow your wheely-basket?
Is that chocolate?
[YOGI AND BOO BOO laughing]
Okay, Boo Boo, keep it steady.
I'm okay, Ma.
Just--
Yeah, no, it's not Jellystone, but at least there's nothing here to drive me crazy.
-Hey, Mr. Ranger.
-Hey, Yogi.
[CART CRASHES]
All right, Ma, I gotta call you back.
What are you guys doing here?
We need your help, Mr. Ranger, sir.
But don't worry, my days of goofing things up for you are over.
MAN:
Hey, move that shopping cart!
[SHOUTING]
I'm okay!
I'm just gonna put this over here.
What do you want?
I don't have a life left for you to ruin anymore.
Sir, I know I messed things up and I'm sorry.
I never meant to.
You and Boo Boo are the best friends I ever had.
And I've never done anything but think of myself.
And now Jellystone is just gonna be a big field of stumps.
What?
They've started cutting down the trees.
"Agricultural interest" is logging.
Oh, no, not our Jellystone.
We have to save it, sir.
I don't think we can save it, Yogi.
I'm no smarter than you.
I lost Jellystone.
I lost Rachel.
It's over.
Mr. Ranger, I've learned two things from stealing pic-a-nic baskets.
One:
light mayonnaise is not nearly as good as regular mayonnaise.
And two: you can't fail if you never stop trying.
You have to fight for the things you love whether it's a park, a girl or a roast beef sandwich.
Don't give up now.
We're all Jellystone's got.
You're right, Yogi.
Jellystone's too important to give up on.
We gotta try.
Come on.
-Shotgun.
-Aw.
I never thought I'd see this.
Happy 1 00th anniversary, Jellystone.
Isn't that Miss Movie Lady?
RACHEL:
I gotta get in there.
You don't understand.
Let me in, please.
No can do.
Park is closed to the public until the press conference.
Mayor's orders.
Then go talk to him.
Tell him what I told you.
I'm sorry.
I don't really take orders from a--
I lived with gorillas, pal.
I know rage.
You do not want me to go gorilla on you.
[SCREAMS]
Uh, I'll speak to the mayor.
-Thank you.
-Okay.
Rachel.
Ranger Smith.
I didn't think I'd ever see you again.
I know.
I don't know what I was thinking.
I think you're perfect.
I think any guy in the world would be lucky just to stand next to you.
You really mean that?
Of course I do.
It's just, when I lost Jellystone, I felt like such a failure.
But losing you has felt much, much worse.
I'm like....
I'm like a genus without a phylum.
That's the sweetest thing anyone's ever said to me.
-So, um, we're still here.
YOGI:
Mm-hm.
Oh, right.
Ahem.
So, what are you doing here?
-Come on, I'll show you.
-Okay.
I was reviewing the documentary footage from Boo Boo's camera and I saw this.
Oh, my.
I see it.
I have a bald spot back there!
I'm not talking about you, Yogi.
I'm talking about this.
Yeah, it's my pet turtle.
He hangs out at the cave all the time.
True.
You know they don't come out of that shell?
I tried one time to see what one would look like without it.
But, nope, they're sewn in.
This is no regular turtle.
See the bulging frog-like eyes and the really wide mouth?
A frog-mouthed turtle?
Yup, Rafetus swinhoei.
smith:
But those are extinct.
For a hundred years, but apparently one still exists.
And he lives in there.
But they won't let me through the gates to go find him.
But if Jellystone has an endangered species living in it, then--
It has to be protected as a park.
That's the law.
That turtle can save this park.
Now I feel kinda bad about using him as a foot stool.
CHIEF:
You've seen the filmmaker?
Well, we spoke.
About extinct turtles.
You're telling me there is an extinct turtle living here in the park?
According to Miss Johnson's film, there is.
An extinct turtle?
That's great.
Visitors will come from miles around to see an endangered species.
Yes, they will, and that is great.
We need to find this turtle.
Just to keep it safe.
Have a vet check it out.
The whole deal.
The sooner we get to him the better.
Oh, we need a head ranger who's good enough to find it.
Someone who thinks like a turtle.
I am that head ranger.
Well, then why are you still here?
He's back.
Come on.
You need to let us in this park.
That turtle needs protection.
Don't worry about the turtle.
We're handling it.
We'll make sure he's put in a nice zoo.
No.
A turtle that's endangered can't be removed from its natural habitat.
It's against federal law.
It is?
Wow, I've never heard of that law in chapter 4, subsection 6 of the Wildlife Protection Mandate.
Don't worry, Mr. Ranger, sir.
That turtle is safe.
These people have no idea where my cave is.
The turtle's in the talking bear's cave.
JONES [OVER radio]:
Copy.
Wow, that backfired.
Okay.
You know what?
Fine,
You win.
What are you doing?
I have a plan.
One of the advantages of having lived here since I was a kid is I know this park like the back of my hand.
Let's go!
Hold on, boys.
All right.
Hey, there, little buddy.
Hello, there.
Uh-oh.
Sorry about that.
-Mayor Brown.
-This had better be good, Jones.
JONES:
I found the turtle.
He was in Boo Boo's sleeping bag.
But now I have him secure at the picnic area.
Jones, you're a hero.
Sit tight.
My chief of staff is on his way to get him.
Copy that.
Head Ranger Jones over and out.
smith:
He found the turtle.
Dang it.
Can't cross those rapids.
There's no way to get to him from here.
Well, there is one way.
There it is.
My masterpiece.
-You really think you can pull this off?
-l know I can, sir.
I'm gonna snatch that basket-type turtle box and fly away like a fuzzy bird.
And I've got the best copilot a basket-snatching machine could have.
-l don't know how to fly this thing.
-Well, you'll pick it up as we go.
smith:
Okay.
Look, just be careful, okay, Yogi?
Copy that, ground control.
Basket-Nabber 2000 ready for takeoff.
-Flight systems check.
Boo Boo?
-What?
-Can you reach the pedals?
-lf I point my toes.
Flight systems are go.
Remember what I told you about flying gliders, Yogi.
Don't fight the wind.
As long as the wind wants me to snatch up that turtle, we'll get along just fine.
-All right.
YOGI:
Start pedaling, Boo Boo.
All right.
Here goes.
YOGI:
Hold on, Boo Boo.
Fasten your seat belt.
But there isn't one.
YOGI:
Here we go!
BOO BOO:
Oh, Yogi!
The wind should carry you south!
We'll meet you there!
Take your time, Mr. Ranger.
This machine is equipped with landing gear.
We'll touch down as soft as a feather.
Whoops.
This is your captain speaking.
We'll reach our turtle target in about two minutes.
So let's go ahead and start the beverage service.
-Yogi, look out.
-Aah!
-Trees!
-Yes, trees!
[BOTH SCREAMING]
I got it.
I got it.
I got it.
I don't got it!
BOO BOO:
Pull up.
-Hey!
-Pull up!
You did it, Yogi.
Oh.
Yeah.
Ha-ha-ha.
Great job, Jones.
I'll get this guy to the city zoo.
-The city zoo?
-Yep.
They got a nice spot ready in the reptile house.
The city zoo doesn't have a reptile house.
They're building one.
-Who is?
-Builders.
Sure you're trying to protect the turtle?
Yeah, we love turtles.
Then you won't mind if I hold onto him until I notify the Wildlife Federation, right?
All right.
You're gonna find this out in a few hours anyway, so I might as well tell you.
We gotta lose this turtle to sell logging rights to the park.
Logging?
The whole park?
Yeah, but who cares?
It's still a park, just without trees.
And they'll grow back.
Yeah, in like 200 years.
It doesn't matter.
Your career is what matters.
Ha-ha-ha.
Turtle target acquired.
I need 20 more feet of altitude.
Engage the hand pedals.
You couldn't put the hand pedals by you?
There's a suggestion box behind the seat, Boo Boo.
[GROANS]
Wait, you don't want to approach him like that.
He's poisonous.
He's in a basket.
But he can spit.
Poison.
He'll aim at your eyes.
Melt them out of your head.
-l'm telling you, that turtle is deadly.
-What are you looking at?
-Hook me in, Boo Boo.
-Okay.
And fire!
Here you go.
Huh?
Yogi, wait!
Here I come!
He's going for the turtle.
-Mind if I borrow this?
-Hey!
[YOGI LAUGHS]
Look, Boo Boo!
We got the turtle!
Hey, why aren't you in your seat?
That bear knows how to steal a basket.
Everybody after that glider now!
I'm not gonna let a bear make me look bad.
Been there, buddy.
We're drifting too far right.
I wanna get us outside the park.
Don't fight the wind, Yogi.
Remember what Miss Movie Lady said about--
Never mind.
YOGI:
Hang on, Boo Boo.
-What do we do now?
Did you check the safety manual?
It's just a picture of us screaming.
[BOTH SCREAMING]
We've got to deject, Boo.
Don't you mean eject?
Eject is up.
Deject is down.
In case of emergency your seat can also be used as a flotation device!
[YOGI laughing]
[GRUNTlNG]
Hey, told you.
Nothing to worry about.
I actually think I wasn't worried enough.
Let me see how our little passenger is doing.
Wonder why they call him a frog-mouthed turtle anyway?
Hey!
smith:
Hey, guys, over here!
Yogi, grab the branch.
Got you, Mr. Ranger, sir.
[smith AND RACHEL GRUNT]
-Welcome aboard.
smith:
Yogi.
We were trying to get you off the raft.
Yeah, that makes more sense.
You guys did it.
You saved him.
[CAR HORN HONKS]
Oh, no.
They're gonna catch us downstream.
I'm on it.
No, Yogi, don't.
Problem solved.
They can't catch us now.
Yeah, because now we are headed straight for the Jellyjarring Rapids.
[GRUNTS]
-Grab a paddle.
-Tuck your head in, little buddy.
Brace yourselves.
Oh, come on, turtle.
Don't worry, I put safety belts in this raft for just such an occasion.
You better hang on.
Mr. Ranger said--
YOGI:
We're gonna be fine, Boo Boo.
Just sit back and let Mother Nature carry us to--
[ALL SCREAMING]
I think Mother Nature's kind of cranky today.
You okay, Yogi?
Fine!
Turtle!
YOGI:
Who's that?
I can't see.
Come here, turtle.
-Got him.
smith:
Good work, Boo Boo.
We made it through the rapids.
Yeah, but that means the falls are just up ahead.
Hold on!
[screaming]
Yogi.
Yogi.
Now who says there are no rides at Jellystone?
Yeah, you've definitely got the thrill part down.
ANNOUNCER:
Please, take your seats.
The press conference is about to begin.
That's over a mile away.
We're never gonna make that in time.
[ALL GASP]
-Ranger Jones?
-l messed up pretty bad, sir.
-l know. lt's okay.
-l wanted to be head ranger.
Because you're a good head ranger and I value leadership.
I have a merit badge--
Can we talk later?
We're pressed for time.
Yes.
Get in.
[SIREN wailing]
YOGI:
Boo Boo!
Boo Boo!
Wait up!
smith:
Well, well.
Guess who we found.
Starts with T and ends with a-- "Urtle"?
It's over.
Call off the logging.
The law says this park is now a protected nature preserve.
You think I care about what the law says?
Or about some endangered "frog-mouthed turtle"?
Or some stupid park for families to have a picnic in?
I care about power, you pinheads!
And I'm gonna get it.
Nobody knows this turtle exists.
And nobody ever will.
You found the turtle.
Get this thing out of here before anybody else sees it.
-Rachel!
-Oh!
Yogi!
BOO BOO:
Yogi, here!
Thank you.
-Yogi.
-l'm sorry.
He was open.
Ha, ha.
Now if you'll excuse me, I have a press conference.
I can still tell them what you did.
Oh, yeah?
Without that turtle or a scrap of evidence, go right ahead.
Well, you might as well tell them Bigfoot is here.
Ha-ha-ha.
And do yourself a favor, there, ranger.
Try to keep your dignity.
It's all you have left.
You know what?
I'm taking care of this thing myself this time.
That's the only way to make sure the job is done right.
But that's why I'm the mayor's right-hand man, right?
Because I don't make mistakes.
Hey, you know, people are wondering:
"Why should I vote for Mayor Brown to be governor?"
Well, how about this:
Mayor Brown just turned the city's budget from a deficit into a surplus!
And put $1 000 into the pocket of every citizen of this city!
Now before I sign the paperwork that will save the city why don't you all take a look at my first campaign ad for governor?
ANNOUNCER:
Mayor Brown, the right choice for governor.
We're out of time.
Must be something we can do.
Anybody have any ideas?
Well, I guess this is going to be a pretty sad documentary, huh?
Are you--?
is he still filming?
I needed more footage, so I told him to keep it rolling.
I can plug that into the video feed right up there.
I just need a way to distract the guards.
I think we can take care of that.
ANNOUNCER:
He supports public safety.
[JOURNEY'S "DON'T STOP believing" playing ON TV]
All right, hurry up, people.
Focus.
Let's go save those orphans.
YOGI:
Hey, hey, hey, check this out!
-Kick it, Boo Boo.
-Kicking it.
Don't stop believing
[laughing]
Hold on to that feeling
ANNOUNCER:
He's tough on crime.
[SHOUTS]
Hey, hey, hey, look at this.
Keep your eye on the little bear.
Look at the skills.
Amazing!
[GRUNTlNG]
ANNOUNCER:
And here's what Mayor Brown proudly has to say about protecting our natural resources.
[music STOPS]
You think I care about what the law says?
Or about some endangered "frog-mouthed turtle"?
-Some stupid park for families to picnic in?
-No.
No.
No. I care about power, you pinheads!
Oh, boy.
Nobody knows this turtle exists.
And nobody ever will.
[BOOING AND jeering]
[laughing]
There's about to be a riot out there.
I need you out front.
[GRUNTS]
Okay.
No.
Hey, wait.
Wait, wait, wait.
Please, please, please.
That was not real.
Trust me, there is no such thing as a frog-mouthed turtle.
He's right next to me, isn't he?
Okay.
-We did it, Yogi!
-Up high, Boo Boo!
-All right!
JONES:
We got it!
Yogi!
All right, and now....
Miss Moviemaker Lady.
smith:
Hey, we did it.
[laughing]
Hey, Mr. Ranger!
RACHEL:
Come on, Boo Boo.
-Okay.
I was wrong, Yogi.
I say from here on, we just be proud of who we are and fight for the things we're passionate about, like this park.
And Rachel.
And pic-a-nic baskets?
And pic-a-nic baskets.
-Aw, come here!
-No, you don't have to--
Okay.
All right, that's--
I'm good.
[CROWD chattering]
RACHEL:
Here you go, Boo Boo.
Take good care of him.
Hey, there, buddy.
No, no, no, I never took a kickback on anything in my entire career.
No one loves turtles more than I do.
And nature in general. I love trees.
Oh, no, you don't!
[GROWLS]
Gorilla?
Himalayan snow leopard.
Huh.
Welcome to Jellystone, home of the frog-mouthed turtle.
And brochures.
I'm Ranger Jones.
NARRATOR:
Ah, yes, Jellystone Park.
A wonderful little piece of paradise.
Where families come and soak up the tranquility of nature.
It's a place that--
[machine WHIRRING]
Huh?
Never mind.
MAN:
Hey, hey, hey!
[chattering lNDlSTlNCTLY]
Hi.
Welcome.
Well, I am certainly glad that you are gonna be staying in Jellystone for a while.
And what animal will you be observing?
Well, I thought I would observe the courting rituals of the American ranger.
I happen to hear the American ranger is a very charming intelligent, attractive species.
One that always keeps his cool.
Even when basket-stealing bears push his buttons?
Listen, Yogi will be Yogi.
And I'm just not gonna let it bother me anymore.
Besides I have more important things to focus on.
Oh....
[laughing]
I....
Let's-
- Let's try that again.
[HORN honking]
[gasping]
Afternoon, Mr. Ranger, sir!
Hi, Miss Movie Lady!
[BARKING]
Yogi!
I love this place.
smith:
Yogi!
Hey!

Jellystone Park.
One of the nation's oldest and most beautiful stretches of wilderness.
For years, families have headed out from the busy city... eager to enjoy a little camping, fishing and, of course, observing the park's natural wildlife.
Boo Boo, I think it's time
I introduced myself to that pic-a-nic basket.
You know, Yogi, we could just hunt for food.
All the other animals do.
Boo Boo, a pic-a-nic basket has everything a bear needs.
And I'm not just talking about the treats and snack-type goodies.
No.
A pic-a-nic basket holds a lot more than that.
It holds... dreams.
- What are we looking at?
- I don't know.
Hook me in.
You sure it'll work, Yogi?
Well, you know, Boo Boo, I'm smarter than the average bear!
All right!
Ranger Smith!
Sorry about that.
We got a 4-23 in Redwood Valley, sir.
- A what?
- A bear disturbance.
- I think it's probably...
- I know who it is.
Why didn't you just say "bear disturbance"?
Well, I....
Uh, well, it sounds cooler.
I mean, we're park rangers, sir.
You know,
"To protect and preserve."
Did you just make that motto up?
Yeah, I did.
Do you like it?
Ranger Jones, you know that, well, being a park ranger, it's not about mottos.
It's about keeping the park safe.
That's where the glory is.
Protecting all of this.
Yeah, I know.
Besides, that motto was still in the testing phase.
It's not like I... made T-shirts or anything.
Heh, no, of course not.
Okay, I'm gonna deal with that 4-23.
Okay, copy that, sir.
Um, I'm actually gonna hop in the Armadillo, make some rounds.
Jones, you know that the Armadillo is for head ranger use only.
I might need it at any moment to deal with...
a park emergency.
Why don't you finish stacking those trail maps?
Yeah, sure.
Okay.
Yeah, cause that's what future head rangers do, they stack maps.
Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy!
Our days of getting banged up to grab a meal are over, Boo Boo.
From now on, the pic-a-nic baskets are going to fall into our arms.
Soldering iron.
- Here you go.
-Thank you.
Okay.
That should do it.
Test rock.
Okay, Yogi.
Weight sensor triggered.
Basket in position.
Launch spring starts coiling.
Firing pin drops.
And....
Bull's-eye!
I'm so smart it hurts!
Uh, you're standing on the soldering iron.
Or it's that.
Hot, hot, hot!
Hot, hot!
There's the test rock.
Now we just wait here for a pic-a-nic basket to fall into our arms.
Are you sure about this, Yogi?
People seem to get pretty mad when you...
A genius never questions his instincts, Boo Boo.
When you have a mind like mine... you can't blink or you'll put a kink in your think.
Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.
We've got our first customers.
And they have pie!
I wonder what kind it is.
Yogi, are you out here?
- It's Mr. Ranger.
- Aah!
Get rid of the test rock.
Destroy the evidence.
I was never here.
Look...
Ow!
Hello, Mr. Ranger, sir.
Did you just...?
Did you guys...?
Did you...?
Oh, never mind.
Look, Yogi, there was a complaint about a bear interfering with a family picnic.
I see.
And you'd like us to mount some sort of investigation?
No, I think it was you.
What?
!
How can you even think that?
Are you feverish?
Let me press my lips against your forehead.
Wait!
You're not... not pressing your lips against my forehead.
Hey, it's a lot better than the way they take my temperature.
No, look, Yogi, we've been over this many times.
Bears are supposed to avoid people, not run around stealing their food.
I agree, sir.
That's why my friend Boo Boo and I would never think of disturbing a family's pic-a-nic.
Huh.
It missed.
Good day, Mr. Ranger, sir.
We'll keep our eyes peeled.
I wonder if he noticed the pie.
Ra...
Smith.
You have a vis...
Over.
I didn't understand a word of that, Jones.
Sorry.
Some lady's here to see you.
Send her in.
- Okay.
I'll be in the Armadillo.
- Or you could be....
- Map stacking?
- Map stacking.
- Ranger Smith?
- Yes.
- Hello.
I'm Rachel Johnson.
- Hi.
I was hoping to talk to you about filming a documentary here.
Sure.
I can handle you for that.
Handle that for you.
Sorry.
My work isn't...
My brain isn't working right.
I must have inhaled some jimsonweed.
Oh.
Datura stramonium.
It's known to cause delirium,
- cramping and nausea.
- Cramping and nausea.
You've read "The North American Wilderness Guide".
Yeah, I like to... highlight all the plants and animals I see.
- I like to...
Me too.
- Ha, ha!
Yeah.
Ranger Smith.
At your service.
So, you-you wanna film a documentary in Jellystone?
Yes.
I sent you a letter about a month ago.
- Written on a piece of bark.
- That was you!
Yes.
I'm sorry about that.
I was in Sumatra, living among the orangutans at the time and... they get very nervous if they spot anything from the modern world.
Really?
Wow, that's amazing.
Then what did you use for ink?
Bird poop and spit.
Impressive.
So, what are you here to film?
Oh, I was hoping to shoot a local species.
Something to really capture the beauty of a national park.
That's terrific.
What animal were you thinking?
I heard you had an unusual brown bear.
- Brown bear?
- Yes.
One that talks?
Those are so rare.
- None that I can think of.
- Named Yogi?
Wears a hat and a tie?
No, that doesn't ring a bell.
I think he's standing on the roof, trying to steal your lunchbox.
I smell PB and J.
I'm all done.
Oh, right.
That Yogi.
Bankrupt?
No, no, no.
We're a city.
Cities don't go bankrupt.
They do when they're broke, sir.
Well, I guess we're just gonna have to find some money somewhere.
Right?
Because I'm about to run for governor.
How am I gonna do that when my own city is going bankrupt?
O-kay, yes.
Thank you.
- Here's the invoice, Mr. Mayor.
- Yikes!
Wow.
Ha.
I'm gonna pretend I didn't see that.
Just bill it to the city, okay?
Thank you.
How did we ever go so broke?
- I think we just spent too much.
- Hmm.
Is there anything we can sell?
You already sold the public golf course to condo developers... two of the three fire stations to that frozen yogurt company...
And you were selling the library, but it burned down.
Oh, yeah.
That was gonna be one of those make-your-own-doughnut places.
- No.
- Yeah.
If you can dream it up, you can make it.
Ah.
Love those places.
Ohh...
We gotta think of something here.
Well, if we don't have anything to sell, maybe we can profit off what we can't sell.
I don't understand those words.
Like when we sold the bottling rights to the water in Lake Beuclair.
- Oh...
We made a fortune ou of that.
- Yeah.
And Sinkhole Beuclair is a great place to throw old mattresses.
- Oh, yeah.
- Hmm.
We just don't have any more resources to exploit.
Or do we?
...
Jellystone.
If we rezone Jellystone Park as agricultural land, we can sell the logging rights.
Here.
This company says they'll give us thousands of dollars an acre just to... cut down the trees or something.
That'll be enough to balance the budget and give each citizen a big fat check.
You have any idea how many votes that'll buy me?
- Enough to be the next governor?
- Exactly.
You're fine, Yogi.
It's just a few scrapes and bruises.
I don't know, Mr. Ranger.
I'm pretty sure I heard my spine snap.
Well, you wouldn't be able to stand.
And... you wouldn't be able to eat.
I'm okay!
Yogi, Boo Boo, I would like to introduce you to Rachel Johnson who's here to make a nature documentary.
- What the heck was that?
- I was... saying hello.
I lived in a den with brown bears for six months.
Only bear I've ever lived with is Boo Boo.
And he only makes that sound after he's eaten baked beans.
I have problems with baked beans.
And for a little bear, he makes a lot of stink.
Okay, I have some fantastic river otters you can film instead.
I could probably get a hat and tie on the slow one.
No, you know, I really, really like these two.
- Would you guys mind if I shoot you?
- Huh?
Yogi, I think she meant with a camera.
Yes.
Of course with a camera.
Heh-heh-heh.
I knew that.
But not just any camera.
This isn't gonna make me look fat, is it?
No, you are gonna look great.
Okay, just a few more adjustments.
Please, excuse the pre-tied bow tie.
My mornings are often rushed.
It's fine, Boo Boo.
This is going to be a whole new perspective for a documentary.
The Boo Boo cam will capture the true wilderness in all its natural glory.
No other human in sight.
That sounds like my apartment.
Ub, you know, because I live...
I live alone.
Well, plenty of women have tried to change that.
It's just I haven't found one that...
- Likes you?
- Yeah...
What?
No.
No, that...
Will return your calls?
Can you stop helping, please?
Sir, I can see you like this lady.
But your courting rituals need work.
What you need to do is follow her around for two days, making snorting sounds.
Then fight any male that looks at her.
And then, of course, urinate on her to mark her as your territory.
Works every time.
I got it under control, Yogi.
- Boo Boo, you're rolling.
- Cool.
Yogi Bear, a brown bear commonly found in North America and Alaska.
Weighing up to 1,800 pounds, brown bears are also the national animal of Finland.
Boo Boo, I don't think you have to narrate.
But I liked where you were going with it, Boo Boo.
- I was hooked.
- Really?
Yes.
Now try to film from flattering angles, if you know what I mean.
Pic-a-nic baskets may be delicious on the lips, but they're a lifetime on the hips.
Oh, no.
Ranger Smith!
Ranger Smith.
The mayor's here.
What's he doing here?
Why didn't he give us more warning?
I have to secure the area.
All units, lock down the park.
Repeat, lock down the park.
Jones, you know I'm the only other ranger here, right?
Yeah.
- Ranger Smith, we need to talk.
- You could've just called.
Oh, yeah, but I thought this would be more friendly.
I'm really working on my people skills.
Anyway, I am closing your park down.
- Okay.
- What?
Oh, yeah, this place just costs the city way too much money.
Jellystone hasn't made its operating budget in 10 years.
Actually...
You know, it's-it's hard to compete with all those amusement parks...
Oh, hey, you're not kiddin'.
Oh, have you guys been to Lincoln Log Land yet?
Oh, man, they have got a roller coaster there, it's made completely out of logs.
It's just like they rode in the pioneer days.
It's unbelievable.
Sir, Jellystone is special.
Okay?
It-it's turning 100 years old this very year.
Why, it's a landmark.
I would never let it be closed down.
Well, uh, you actually don't have a choice.
Have you read the... city by-laws lately?
Chapter 6.
Section 73.
"Any municipal property that can't generate enough money
"to cover its operating budget
"can be rezoned for other uses."
And since Jellystone loses money every year... we're shutting it down.
Uh, sorry?
- I thought that went well.
- Yeah.
Just a second, Mr. Mayor.
Who says we can't cover our operating budget?
Park doesn't report its earnings till next quarter.
Yeah, which is like one week away.
Come on, Smith.
You gotta be 20,000 dollars in the hole.
We wish.
Yeah.
Try 30,562.
That's probably a couple hundred extra for the map stand.
I think it's confession time.
- I only pretended to fix it.
- Thanks, Jones.
Sounds like you're in pretty deep there, Smith.
Maybe we are, Mr. Mayor.
But this park is one of the last few places families can go to be close to nature.
And the world needs that.
Well, I'm not mayor of the world.
I'm mayor of this city.
And this city needs this park rezoned.
I'm sorry.
Oh...
I feel awful about it.
Even though I look really good.
This is a... new suit.
So... okay.
Maybe we don't have our operating budget today.
But you know what?
A lot can happen in a week.
Well, all right.
Have it your way, Smith.
Take a week.
Hey, you know what?
I'll even get you started.
What's the admission fee for one car again?
Four dollars.
Four dollars, huh?
Four whole dollars?
Well, that changes everything.
Oh, my goodness.
Well, I only need to come back in here like, uh, what, 10,000 more times?
In a week!
Do I have time for that?
- Impossible.
- Oh, shoot!
You hungry, buddy?
Of course!
I'm always hungry.
I was talking to my pet turtle.
Here you go.
That better not be my beefjerky.
So, what's the big deal, Yogi?
This is the big deal, Boo Boo.
It's my masterpiece.
The Basket-Nabber 2000.
The most advanced pic-a-nic basket-stealing technology ever invented.
Wow.
Climb aboard.
This glider can steer... dive, shoot rubber bands at pesky-type birds... and even has an air bag.
- Had an air bag.
- Sorry, Yogi.
Not to worry, Boo Boo.
We could cushion our landing with all the pic-a-nic baskets we swipe.
Now, how's that copilot seat feel?
A little wobbly, like it's not tied on very tight.
Eh, you won't feel that in the air.
Get ready to fly faster than the speed of sandwich, Boo Boo.
We're gonna break the pic-a-nic barrier.
- Yogi!
- Uh-oh.
That's not his happy voice.
Don't move.
I'm switching the glider into stealth mode.
Stealth mode?
Wow.
How are you able to...?
Oh.
Ah, Mr. Ranger, sir.
Welcome.
Can I interest you in a sody pop?
There you go.
When did you steal our vending machine?
I, um...
I'm repairing it, sir.
This machine gives its sodas away for free when a bear kicks it.
Look, a camper has reported some missing fishing poles, so...
I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say it was you.
Fishing poles?
Sir, I'm a bear.
If I wanted to catch fish, I would just use my....
Your paws, Yogi.
Isn't that kind of unsanitary?
What's that?
- What's what?
- That thing.
- What thing?
- The thing under the blanket.
- Blanket?
- The object right behind you.
Oh.
Oh, that.
A sculpture.
I'm sculpting now.
Mostly landscapes.
And where's Boo Boo?
- France.
- What?
- That's... not close by, is it?
- No.
Then he's in the bathroom.
- Excuse me.
- Wait, wait, wait!
Hey, this isn't the bathroom.
I'm telling you, Mr. Ranger, it's-it's not for stealing pic-a-nic baskets.
It says "Basket-Nabber 2000" right here, Yogi.
I do regret calling it that now.
I know I'm always saying "Stay away from the campers".
This is different.
Jellystone is in real trouble.
If I don't raise 30,000 dollars in a week, this park's getting rezoned.
Rezoned?
What does that mean?
It means the park won't be a park anymore.
The city will use this land for something else.
So we have got to do everything we can to help save it.
Which means you have gotta stop stealing food so that campers will leave here happy.
But they do leave here happy.
Getting your food stolen by Yogi Bear is special.
People come here for that.
It's like catching a foul ball at a baseball game.
Nope.
It's like getting your food stolen at a baseball game.
Come on, Yogi.
Would it really be so hard to be a regular bear?
You know, to forage for food, to walk around on all fours... to hibernate a little, or... or a lot.
If nature had meant for me to be a regular bear... it wouldn't have given me such a good thought-cooker, sir.
I can't help it if my melon is full of smart juice.
Yo-Yogi, your melon is hurting this park.
There are repercussions to stealing people's picnic baskets.
Not in my experience, sir.
On the other hand...
Ranger Smith, mind if I borrow the 'dilla?
It's an emergency.
Somebody parked without displaying the parking decals.
Jones, I would really prefer it if you focused on just maintaining the park instead.
Why don't you just let me deal with the park visitors until you've had a little bit more experience.
Okay?
Sorry, sir.
Guess that's just the Eagle Scout in me, you know?
Always wanting to be in control, be a leader...
Live up to this... fanny pack full of merit badges...
Uh, Jones, you know that fanny pack is for first aid supplies, right?
A merit badge in first aid is the only supply I need, sir.
Right, but it might not be the only supply a hurt person needs.
You seen Rachel?
Yeah, I saw her.
She was heading up to Lookout Mountain.
She can't be far.
I'll drive.
Let's roll.
Jones.
The sprawling beauty of Jellystone Park.
A timeless stretch of wilderness untouched by man.
Oh.
Ranger Smith.
Wow, heh.
What's...
with the fancy outfit?
Dress greens.
I always wear the dress greens in the evening.
You know, in case there's, you know...
I don't...
I don't know how to talk to girls.
Oh.
Why do you think I spend so much time with the animals?
All you have to do is scratch their backside and you've got a friend for life.
Hey, you try that with people and all of a sudden you're the weird girl on the bus nobody wants to sit next to.
Um, uh, listen.
I was wondering, If, uh, you know, if you were...
I mean, it's getting late and we could, uh...
Hey, if you want.
I mean, it's not that...
You don't...
It's...
You know, it's not a worry.
Don't worry.
Did you just ask me to dinner?
Yes.
I did.
Heh.
- Good, you got that, huh?
- Yes.
Yeah, I just thought, well, it's getting late and, uh...
I happen to know this great place.
- Very gourmet.
- Really?
Where?
So close you won't believe it.
Wow, how did you ever find this place?
This is a four-star porch.
And fresh from the hot plate, I give you...
- rack of Spam.
- Oh.
Wow.
May-maybe "gourmet" was a bit of a stretch.
No, it actually looks wonderful.
Great.
You know, this really is a peaceful place.
It's something, isn't it?
I pretty much grew up right here.
My... father was a ranger when I was a kid and he...
he turned this park into the number one tourist destination in the state.
I mean, it was a park, you know?
Like families, they...
they came by the hundreds, swam in the streams, and hiked in the trails.
It was really something.
This is really good.
Anyway, I don't know.
Maybe it's my fault, you know.
I-I just spent so many years learning everything I could about the park, so I could be a better ranger.
Right?
But, maybe instead, I should have been comin' up with a gimmick to... get people to come here.
You know, change the name to Extreme Jellystone.
I think that it's perfect just the way it is.
You do?
You're right.
You're absolutely right.
There's no better place on earth than right here.
- Hey, Mr. Ranger.
- Except a place without him.
Evening, Mr. Ranger, sir.
Madame Moviemaker Lady.
And yes, I'm using the fancy tense to show you the utmost respect.
Hi.
What do you want, Yogi?
Well, I was thinking about the park's prickly predicament... and I would like to do my part to help.
This is all the money I have saved.
Almost 100 dollars.
I was going to use it on myself, but I'd rather donate it to Jellystone.
Well, thank you, Yogi.
That's...
That is very sweet.
- Where does a bear get money from?
- That brown box by the parking lot.
The park donation box.
Yep.
But I want you to have it.
Consider it a gift to Jellystone.
That won't be hard.
Look, guys, I appreciate the effort.
But what this park needs is visitors - and lots of 'em.
Well, I can help you there, sir.
Just make me a headliner.
I will rock this place.
- Kick it, Boo Boo.
- Kicking it.
No.
That's not gonna work either, Yogi.
You're right.
We need something flashier than music.
Not a problem.
I've got this water-skiing routine that will change the face of entertainment.
It's got a little of everything.
Music, stunts, magic...
- And I jump over Boo Boo at the end.
- No, you don't.
- I wanna try it.
- I don't care.
Guys, I hate to interrupt, but you're not going to water-ski, or... dance or do anything that might disturb the campers, okay?
Well, if what you really want to do is help save this park, you will lay low, you will stay away from people.
Do you think you can do that for me?
You have my word, Mr. Ranger.
I will be seen, but not heard.
- Or seen.
- Fine.
Huh?
Are you guys done with that spam?
- Get outta here.
- Okay.
Sheesh!
Hey.
- What's this?
- Season's pass applications.
Unfortunately, not a lot of takers on those.
Fifty bucks for an entire year?
Including camping fees?
That's a bargain.
It would be if this park were actually a place people wanted to visit throughout the year.
Maybe Yogi was on to something.
You said the park was turning 100, right?
Right.
Well, a big event could really pull people in.
Yeah, you're right.
We... we could have, like, a moss collection day or a big squirrel chase.
- Or....
- Fireworks.
Yes.
Exactly.
Why didn't I think of that?
We could host a big centennial festival.
People always show up for fireworks.
Yeah.
And if even half of the people bought these season passes, the park were making enough money to stay open.
Right.
Let's get the word out.
I think I can help with that.
That is great.
- H-how did we pay for it?
- Oh, we didn't.
It was some fast-food restaurant, but I rearranged the letters right before the plane took off.
You're very... cool, Rachel Johnson.
You're pretty cool yourself.
Yes, I do have my own kind of natural swagger.
Jellystone National Park, 100th year anniversary.
There'll be fireworks.
Just stay calm, Jones.
Yes, you should be patrolling in the Armadillo right now, making park-impacting decisions, but...
- Hey, 100th year anniversary.
- Thanks.
But you're not there yet.
You still have to follow orders.
Even if those orders make you look like a giant...
Cheez-It.
Mr. Mayor!
Hi, Mr. Mayor.
Why is it only going halfway down again?
Doesn't make any...
No!
Oh, okay.
All right.
So, is it a double tap or do I have to press it to ho...?
- Oh, dang it!
- I got it, sir.
Yeah.
That's exactly what I did.
Let me see one of those fliers.
"Come celebrate Jellystone's 100th anniversary with fireworks and fun."
"And receive 10 off a season pass"?
He's gonna try to make the budget selling season passes.
Yeah, ugh.
It's not a very good idea, in my opinion.
But... nobody consulted me, cause my job is just to maintain the park, which is... basically poking trash with a stick.
Yeah.
Yeah, why is a guy with your talent doing this insulting grunt work?
You should be running a park.
Yeah, but Ranger Smith says I have to pay my dues.
- What, excuse me?
- What?
He has to pay his dues?
Nobody pays dues anymore.
You gotta be in charge now while you still know everything.
- That's what I've been saying.
- Yeah.
Buddy, if it was up to me, you would be the head ranger of Jellystone already.
- You'd put me in charge?
- In a second.
Yes.
You know, if this, uh...
centennial festival didn't work out,
I probably could relocate Smith.
You know, uh, maybe you could help me with that.
Make sure it doesn't succeed?
Wait, you mean, like, sabotage it?
No.
Oh, no, no, no.
No.
No, I want you to be head ranger.
It just so happens that the only way to do that is to bring down this festival.
But, whatever.
You can spend the rest of your life as second-in-command if you like.
That's fine.
It's a perfectly valid life choice.
Well, you just think about it and give me a call, okay?
Here's my card.
So long.
Hey.
Now, why is it doing that?
No.
Boy Scouts are loyal, thrifty, kind....
Hey, you're back.
Hey, thanks for getting those fliers out.
Let me tell you, this festival is gonna be huge.
Hey, Ranger Smith, how long do you think until I reach head ranger status?
Oh, no time at all.
I did it in 12 short years.
Ha-ha, okay.
Are you serious?
Just be patient, Jones.
It'll be here before you know it.
This festival's gonna be great!
I can't wait 12 years.
Seasons pass order forms.
Seasons pass order forms.
Thank you.
Season's pass order forms, 10 dollars off today.
Ah, enjoy.
I can't take it, Boo Boo.
Two days without a tasty treat to eat?
And I have to sit up here while they're having a "happy birthday, Jellystone" party?
And they have doughnuts.
Doughnuts!
Yogi, what are you doing?
- Yogi!
- I'm going.
Hey.
Wait.
Don't do it, Yogi.
You promised Mr. Ranger.
You're right.
I'm losing control, Boo Boo.
I don't know who's steering the ship.
Here.
I want you to handcuff me to this tree and not unlock it no matter what I say.
Okay, Yogi.
- Okay, unlock me.
- Huh?
It was a bad idea.
Unlock me.
Unlock me!
Okay.
Here you go.
Folks, I hate to say this, but there are no spots left.
Um...
Forecast called for thunderstorms.
Uh, severe lightning.
I fear for your young ones.
Uh, we're out of fireworks, I'm afraid.
It's just sparklers left.
Oh, no.
Mr. Mayor, you look nice.
Your napkin matches your tie.
I don't need you to kiss up to me, Jones.
I got this guy for that.
That's a good point, sir.
I thought you were gonna handle this situation, and yet there are quite a few people here, aren't there?
Sir, I tried.
All last night I spent taking down fliers...
I blocked the entrance with a vehicle so as to back up traffic.
I even hung up "rabid squirrel" signs everywhere.
Those were hand-drawn.
Nothing is working.
Well, you need to think of something, don't you?
Or maybe you're just not head ranger material.
Mr. Mayor.
Mayor's yes man.
So... glad you could join us.
I saved you a nice little spot next to the porta-potties.
Oh, well, thank you.
Well, that's very thoughtful.
You know, I'm just so glad that these festivities are going so well, Smith.
I just hope nothing goes wrong.
We are gonna pull this off, Jonesy.
I've literally seen hundreds of people filling out season's pass order forms.
The weather's great.
The fireworks, ready to go.
Even Yogi's staying out of the way.
Yogi.
Well.
Hey, guys.
Sorry, just wandering around, bored out of my mind.
Bored?
But the 100th anniversary extravaganza's going on.
Yeah, more like 100th anniversary lame-aganza.
You know, because it's so lame.
People see fireworks every day in the city.
They came here because they thought they'd see something different.
I knew it.
I should be out there doing my water-ski routine.
I'm a shining star and Ranger Smith is holding me back.
I don't know, Yogi.
Mr. Ranger is usually right about these things.
Yeah, Boo Boo, Ranger Smith is in denial.
I mean, he's lost it, you know?
I saw him a couple days ago.
He was filling his pockets with dirt.
He said he's gonna start moving the park to his apartment piece by piece.
- How big is his apartment?
- There's still time.
I won't be able to do the half-hour artistic program... but that was more for me anyway.
These people need the razzle-dazzle.
I don't think we've practiced the razzle-dazzle.
You're not supposed to, Boo Boo.
That's where it gets the razzle.
Yogi, I really don't think we should...
Boo Boo, you've tried to stop my brilliant ideas with common sense a thousand times.
- Has it ever worked?
- No.
Then...
let's go, go, go.
What does that taste like?
Unemployment?
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah.
Thanks again for helping with the fireworks.
I don't know where Ranger Jones disappeared to.
My pleasure.
You know, um, Rachel, I've been wanting to tell you...
- well, how much I...
- Ranger Smith...
No, please, let me get through this.
I'm not very good with words.
But...
I have never felt so... gushy.
- You know?
- Ranger...
You know what I did?
I went and wrote a song... about you.
It's like this:
Oh, no.
...saw you at the station
Had a heart palpitation
My sickness was love And you're the medication
Rachel
- Rachel
- The microphone is on.
And it comes around again
Rachel, Rachel, Rachel
The microphone is on.
Yes, the mic...
Hi.
Hello... and... welcome to the 100th anniversary of Jellystone!
Thank you.
It is so wonderful to see so many people here today.
Um, and I've noticed many of you filling out your season's pass order forms.
We're more than happy to collect those after the fireworks.
But first, please, sit back, get comfortable... and enjoy the show!
- Terrific.
- Mr. Mayor?
That's not the right music.
I'll take it from here, Mr. Ranger!
Oh, no.
- Full speed ahead, Boo Boo.
- Okay.
- Not bad, eh, Boo Boo?
- Looking good, Yogi.
- This cannot be happening.
- Oh, it's happening.
Hello, Jellystone!
No, don't encourage him!
They love me.
I can do no wrong.
Watch this.
All right, Boo Boo!
Turn up the heat!
Phase two, go.
I'm an unstoppable water-skiing machine.
Ta-da!
Oh, wait.
There's more.
How about if I heat things up?
- Yogi!
- Yogi, your cape!
I know.
It is magnificent.
And on fire.
Huh?
Fire!
- Turn the boat!
- Huh?
- Turn, Boo Boo!
- Hang on, Yogi!
Too much razzle!
- Nice one.
- Thanks.
Jump!
Let's go.
Out of my way!
This could not have gone more perfectly.
Hey, you got a little, uh....
Never mind.
Let's go.
Mr. Ranger, I...
I...
I thought...
Yogi, that's the problem.
All the thinking.
Hey, you know what would be great?
If you didn't think.
If you could just be...
a regular bear.
You know, sitting in the woods, minding his own business.
But... no, you're different.
You're smart.
And you'd rather spend your days being selfish and destructive... while everyone else pays the price.
But...
I guess it wasn't enough screwing up my life.
No, this time you had to go and bring down this entire park.
So, tell me, Yogi... how smart are you now?
Hey, there!
That was quite a show you put on yesterday.
I can't wait to see what you do with this.
That's your new assignment.
Evergreen Park.
Oh, I think you're just going to find it delightful.
Oh, and, uh, Ranger Jones is gonna be taking over here.
Ranger Jones?
Well, I have got a press conference to plan.
You see, it turns out...
I've saved the city.
Don't forget to vote, my friend.
Brown for governor!
He's not gonna vote for me, is he?
Uh, no.
You did everything you could.
Doesn't matter.
This park needed a ranger who could make it popular again.
I'm just some guy who knows how old every tree is.
Fat lot of good that did Jellystone.
Face it.
You and I are just two people who care about things that nobody else does and... that's why we're alone.
Or maybe that's why we found each other.
Did you ever... think of that?
Rachel, you and this park have one thing in common.
You both deserve a better man than me.
I can't believe he's really gone.
Yogi, are you okay?
I'm done being special, Boo Boo.
Ranger Smith was right.
My whole life, I've been different.
But it's done nothing but hurt people.
The world would be better off if I was only as smart as the average bear.
Yogi, what are you doing?
I'm leaving, Boo Boo.
I am going to forage for food in the wild.
Huh?
Might even catch some fish.
With my paws.
I'm just gonna grab a little something for the road.
Some chips and soda.
And this.
Peach pie.
- Any more of that casserole?
- Top shelf.
I'll be out there.
Fending for myself.
Foraging for food...
in the wild.
Goodbye, horsepower limiter.
There's a new head ranger in town.
Let's see what you got.
Perfect.
I'm sorry, Ranger Smith.
No more food.
No more pic-a-nickers.
How could this get any worse?
Oh.
Ah, Evergreen Park.
Yes, it is simply delightful.
- Come on.
- I've got it, sir.
This is unbelievable.
Ah, Evergreen Park.
Lovely, isn't it?
This isn't a... park.
I can barely breathe in here.
Look at these trees.
They're all plastic.
Oh, no, they're real.
It's just years of smog and pollution have left a plastic-like coating on them.
You think people are gonna be happy you're closing the most beautiful park in the state?
Well, they will be when they find out it's making the city rich and giving each citizen a check for 1,000 dollars.
How is that even possible?
Oh, well, it turns out that there has been some agricultural interest in the park.
And it's a lot more profitable than people in station wagons making s'mores.
Have a good day...
Ranger Smith.
I hate this car.
I hate it.
Yeah!
Oh, hey, there he is.
Whoa, hey, Mr. Mayor!
I, uh....
Just finishing some... stamping.
You are doing great, Jones.
I knew you were the guy for this job.
Hey, quick thing.
You're probably gonna notice some giant trucks rumbling by out there.
That's just cause we're just clearing a little patch of trees for my press conference.
No big deal.
Um, wait, you're cutting down trees?
Oh, yeah.
Well, just a few.
It's nothing to worry about.
You know, it's actually gonna improve the park quite a bit.
I'll bet you one of the first things you noticed as head ranger is that you need more clear spaces here, and you are absolutely right.
Now you can host concerts and Boy Scout jamborees.
That's a pretty smart move there, Head Ranger Jones.
I have some other park improvements
I wanna run by you too.
Oh, splendid, yes.
I think I have a few moments to hear those.
I want you to look into the security arrangements for tomorrow.
I don't want any surprises.
I'll hear what Ding-Dong has to say.
What do you got?
I'm hungrier than the average bear.
I wish I could find a bush that tasted like birthday cake.
Gotcha.
Pretend it's a gummy worm.
Pretend it's a gummy worm.
Yogi, I've been looking everywhere for you.
Not now, Boo Boo.
I'm busy foraging.
Come on, Yogi.
Jellystone is in trouble.
We need your help.
Nothing I can do, Boo Boo.
I'm average now.
My brain is out of business.
I wouldn't even be standing if my paws didn't hurt.
Quit feeling sorry for yourself.
You know you're not an average bear.
Hey, hey, Boo Boo.
You're right, I'm not.
I failed at that, too.
Hey, come back here.
You've gotta save Jellystone.
What are you doing?
I'm not...
Yogi, you have to use your smarts for good.
And if you can't see that, maybe you are just an average bear.
Come on.
Now do you understand?
What's going on, Boo Boo?
I don't know.
But whatever it is...
I think they're just getting started.
Boo Boo... get... my... collar.
Nobody is gonna hurt Jellystone.
Where are we going, Yogi?
We can't get Jellystone back alone, Boo Boo.
My thinker is good, but Ranger Smith's is better.
He said he was going to a place called Evergreen Park.
- That's right.
In the city.
- The city?
That's a long walk.
Don't be silly, Boo Boo.
I've already got a smarty-smart cheat to keep our feet off the street.
Get ready for it.
Here it comes.
Run, Boo Boo, run!
Hurry, Boo Boo.
I think we gotta jump for it.
Ready?
All a-board!
Good.
Yogi, grab my paw.
Sorry.
Boo-Boo-Boo-Boo-Boo-Boo!
I-I-I-I gotta get...!
I guess it makes a stop here.
Yup.
Looks like Evergreen Park is about two miles away from here.
Two miles?
I'll have to tap into my emergency rations.
Snack break.
Come on, Yogi.
We need to keep moving.
It's not that far and it's all downhill.
Downhill?
Excuse me, Mr. Dirty Shopper.
Any chance my friend and I might borrow your wheely-basket?
Is that chocolate?
Okay, Boo Boo, keep it steady.
I'm okay, ma.
Just...
Yeah, no, it's not Jellystone, but... at least there's nothing here to drive me crazy.
- Hey, Mr. Ranger.
- Hey, Yogi.
All right, ma, I gotta...
I gotta... call you back.
What are you guys doing here?
We need your help, Mr. Ranger, sir.
But don't worry, my days of goofing things up for you are over.
Hey, move that shopping cart!
I'm okay!
I'm just gonna put this over here.
What do you want from me, Yogi?
I don't have a life left for you to ruin anymore.
Sir, I know I messed things up and I'm sorry.
I never meant to.
You and Boo Boo are the best friends I ever had.
And I've never done anything but think of myself.
And now Jellystone is just gonna be a big field of stumps.
What?
They've started cutting down the trees.
"Agricultural interest" is logging.
Oh, no, not our Jellystone.
We have to save it, sir.
I don't think we can save it, Yogi.
I'm no smarter than you.
I lost Jellystone.
I lost Rachel.
It's... over.
Mr. Ranger, I've learned two things from stealing pic-a-nic baskets.
One:
light mayonnaise is not nearly as good as regular mayonnaise.
And two: you can't fail if you never stop trying.
You have to fight for the things you love, whether it's a park, a girl or a roast beef sandwich.
Don't give up now.
We're all Jellystone's got.
You are right, Yogi.
Jellystone's too important to give up on.
We gotta try.
Come on.
- Shotgun.
- Aw.
I never thought I'd see this.
Happy 100th anniversary, Jellystone.
Isn't that Miss Movie Lady?
I gotta get in there.
You don't understand.
Let me in, please.
No can do.
Park is closed to the public until the press conference.
Mayor's orders.
Then go talk to 'im.
Tell 'im what I told you.
I'm sorry.
I don't really take orders from a...
I lived with gorillas, pal.
I know rage.
You do not want me to go gorilla on you.
Uhh...
I'll speak to the mayor.
- Thank you.
- Okay.
Rachel.
Ranger Smith.
I didn't think I'd ever see you again.
I know.
I don't know what I was thinking.
I think you're perfect.
I think any guy in the world would be lucky just to stand next to you.
- You really mean that?
- Of course I do.
It's... it's just, when I lost Jellystone, I-I felt like such a failure.
But...
losing you has felt much, much worse.
I'm like....
I'm like a genus without a phylum.
That's the sweetest thing anyone's ever said to me.
- So, um, we're still here.
- Mm-hm.
Oh, right.
Ahem.
So, uh, what are you doing here?
- Come on, I'll show you.
- Okay.
I was reviewing the documentary footage from Boo Boo's camera and I saw this.
Oh, my.
I see it.
I have a bald spot back there!
I'm... not talking about you, Yogi.
I'm talking about this.
Yeah, it's my pet turtle.
He hangs out at the cave all the time.
True.
You know they don't come out of that shell?
I tried one time just to see what one would look like without it.
But, nope, they're sewn in.
This is no regular turtle.
See the... bulging frog-like eyes and the really wide mouth?
A frog-mouthed turtle?
Yup, Rafetus swinhoei.
But those are extinct.
For a hundred years, but apparently one still exists.
And he lives in there.
But they won't let me through the gates to go find 'im.
But if Jellystone has an endangered species living in it, then...
It has to be protected as a park.
That's the law.
That turtle can save this park.
Now I feel kinda bad about using him as a foot stool.
You've seen the filmmaker?
Well, we spoke.
About extinct turtles.
Wait, wait.
You're telling me that there is an extinct turtle living here, in the park?
According to Miss Johnson's film, there is.
An extinct turtle?
That's great.
Visitors will come from miles around to see an endangered species.
Yes, they will, and that is great.
We need to find this turtle.
Just to-to keep it safe, you know.
Have a vet check it out.
The whole deal.
The sooner we get to 'im, the better.
Oh, we need a head ranger who's good enough to find it.
Someone who... thinks like a turtle.
I am that head ranger.
Well, then why are you still here?
He's back.
Come on.
Hey!
You need to let us in this park.
That turtle needs our protection.
Don't worry about the turtle.
We're handling it.
We'll make sure he's put in a nice zoo.
No.
A turtle that's endangered can't be removed from its natural habitat.
It's against federal law.
It is?
Wow, I've never heard of that law in chapter 4, subsection 6 of the Wildlife Protection Mandate.
Don't worry, Mr. Ranger, sir.
That turtle is safe.
These people have no idea where my cave is.
The turtle's in the talking bear's cave.
Copy that.
Wow, that backfired.
Okay.
You know what?
Fine.
You win.
- What are you doing?
- I have a plan.
One of the advantages... of having lived here since I was a kid, is...
I know this park like the back of my hand.
Let's go!
Hold on, boys.
All right.
Hey, there, little buddy.
Hello, there.
Uh-oh.
Sorry about that.
- Mayor Brown.
- This had better be good, Jones.
I found the turtle.
He was crawled up in Boo Boo's sleeping bag.
But now I have him secure at the Redwood Valley picnic area.
Jones, you're a hero.
Now, just sit tight.
My chief of staff is on his way to get 'im.
Copy that.
Head Ranger Jones over and out.
Ah, he found the turtle.
Dang it!
And we can't cross those rapids.
There's just no way to get to 'im from here.
Well, there is... one way.
There it is!
My masterpiece.
You really think you can pull this off?
I know I can, sir.
I'm gonna snatch that basket-type turtle box and fly away like a fuzzy bird.
And I've got the best copilot a basket-snatching machine could have.
- I don't know how to fly this thing.
- Well, you'll pick it up as we go.
Okay.
Look, just be careful, okay, Yogi?
Copy that, ground control.
Basket-Nabber 2000 ready for takeoff.
- Flight systems check.
Boo Boo?
- What?
- Can you reach the pedals?
- If I point my toes.
Flight systems are go.
Remember what I told you about flying gliders, Yogi.
Don't fight the wind.
As long as the wind wants me to snatch up that turtle, we'll get along just fine.
- All right.
- Start pedaling, Boo Boo.
All right.
Here it goes.
Hold on, Boo Boo.
Fasten your seat belt.
But there isn't one.
- Here we go!
- Oh, Yogi!
The wind should carry you south!
We'll meet you there!
Take your time, Mr. Ranger.
This machine is equipped with landing gear.
We'll touch down as soft as a feather.
Oops!
This is your captain speaking.
We'll reach our turtle target in about two minutes.
So...
let's go ahead and start the beverage service.
- Yogi, look out.
- Aah!
- Trees!
- Yes, trees!
I got it.
I got it.
I got it.
I don't got it!
Pull up.
- Hey!
- Pull up!
You did it, Yogi.
Oh.
Yeah.
Great job, Jones.
I'll go ahead and get this guy to the city zoo.
- The city zoo?
- Yep.
They got a nice spot all ready in the reptile house.
The city zoo doesn't have a reptile house.
They're building one.
- Oh.
Who is?
- Builders.
Are you sure you're trying to protect the turtle?
Yeah, we love turtles.
Then you won't mind if I hold on to him until I notify the Wildlife Federation, right?
All right.
You're gonna find this out in a few hours anyway, so I might as well tell you.
We gotta lose this turtle so we can sell the logging rights to the park.
Logging?
The whole park?
Yeah, but who cares?
It's still a park, just without trees.
- And they'll grow back.
- Yeah, in like 200 years.
It doesn't matter.
Your career is what matters.
Turtle target acquired.
I need 20 more feet of altitude.
Engage the hand pedals.
You couldn't put the hand pedals by you?
There's a suggestion box behind the seat, Boo Boo.
Wait, uh, hold on.
You don't wanna approach him like that.
- He's, uh, poisonous.
- He's in a basket.
But he can spit.
Poison.
And he'll aim right at your eyes.
Melt them out of your head.
- I'm telling you, that turtle is deadly.
- What are you looking at?
- Hook me in, Boo Boo.
- Okay.
And... fire!
Here you go.
Huh?
Yogi, wait!
Here I come!
He's going for the turtle.
- Mind if I borrow this?
- Hey!
Look, Boo Boo!
We got the turtle!
Hey, why aren't you in your seat?
That bear knows how to steal a basket.
Everybody after that glider.
Now!
I'm not gonna let a bear make me look bad.
Been there, buddy.
We're drifting too far right.
I wanna get us outside the park.
Don't fight the wind, Yogi.
Remember what Miss Movie Lady said about...
Never mind.
- Hang on, Boo Boo.
- What do we do now?
Did you check the safety manual?
It's just a picture of us screaming.
- We've got to deject, Boo.
- Don't you mean eject?
Eject is up.
Deject is... down!
In case of emergency your seat can also be used as a flotation device!
Hey, told you.
Nothing to worry about.
I actually think I wasn't worried enough.
Let me see how our little passenger is doin'.
Wonder why they call him a frog-mouthed turtle anyway?
Hey!
Hey, guys, over here!
Yogi, grab the branch.
Got you, Mr. Ranger, sir.
- Welcome aboard.
- Yogi.
We were trying to get you off the raft.
Yeah, that makes more sense.
You guys did it.
You saved him.
Oh, no.
They're gonna catch us downstream.
- I'm on it.
- No, Yogi, don't.
Problem solved.
They can't catch us now.
Yeah, because now...
we are headed straight for the Jellyjarring Rapids.
- Grab a paddle.
- Tuck your head in, little buddy.
Brace yourselves.
Oh, come on, turtle.
Don't worry, I put safety belts in this raft for just such an occasion.
You better hang on, Yogi.
Mr. Ranger said...
We're gonna be fine, Boo Boo.
Just sit back and let Mother Nature carry us to...
I think Mother Nature's kind of cranky today.
You okay, Yogi?
Fine!
Turtle!
Who's that?
I can't see.
Come here, turtle.
- Got 'im.
- Good work, Boo Boo.
We made it through the rapids.
Yeah, but that means the falls are just up ahead.
Hold on!
Yogi.
Yogi.
Now who says there are no rides at Jellystone?
Yeah, you've definitely got the thrill part down.
Please, take your seats.
The press conference is about to begin.
That's over a mile away.
We're never gonna make that in time.
- Ranger Jones?
- I messed up pretty bad, sir.
- I know, Jones.
And it's okay.
- Because I wanted to be head ranger.
That's part because you're such a good head ranger.
And also because I really value leadership.
I have a merit badge...
Can we talk about this later?
Because of how we're pressed for time.
Yes.
Get in.
Boo Boo!
Boo Boo!
Wait up!
Well, well.
Guess who we found.
Starts with T and ends with a... "urtle"?
It's all over, Mr. Mayor.
Call off the logging deal.
The law says this park is now a protected nature preserve.
You think I care about what the law says?
Or about some endangered "frog-mouthed turtle"?
Or some stupid park for families to have a picnic in?
I care about power, you pinheads!
And I'm gonna get it.
Nobody knows this turtle exists.
And nobody ever will.
You found the turtle.
Get this thing outta here before anybody else sees it.
- Rachel!
- Oh!
Yogi!
Yogi, here!
Thank you.
- Yogi...
- I'm sorry.
He was open.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I... have a press conference.
I can still tell them what you did.
Oh, yeah?
Without that turtle or a scrap of evidence, go right ahead.
Well, you might as well tell them Bigfoot is here.
And do yourself a favor there, ranger.
Try to keep your dignity.
It's all you have left.
You know what?
I'm taking care of this thing myself this time.
That's the only way to make sure the job is done right.
But that's why I'm the mayor's right-hand man, right?
Because I...
don't make mistakes.
Hey, you know, people are wondering:
"Why should I vote for Mayor Brown to be governor?"
Well, how about this:
Mayor Brown just turned the city's budget from a deficit into a surplus!
And put 1,000 dollars into the pocket of every citizen of this city!
Now, before I sign the paperwork that will save the city, why don't you all take a look at my first campaign ad for governor?
Mayor Brown, the right choice for governor.
We're out of time.
Must be something we can do.
Does anybody have any ideas?
Well, I guess this is going to be a pretty sad documentary, huh?
Are you...?
Is he still filming?
I needed more footage, so I told him to keep it rolling.
I can plug that into the video feed right up there.
I just need a way to distract the guards.
I think we can take care of that.
He supports public safety.
All right, hurry up, people.
Focus.
Let's go save those orphans.
Hey, hey, hey, check this out!
- Kick it, Boo Boo.
- Kicking it.
He's tough on crime.
Hey, hey, hey, look at this.
Keep your eye on the little bear.
Look at the skills.
Amazing!
And here's what Mayor Brown proudly has to say about protecting our natural resources.
You think I care about what the law says?
Hm?
Or about some endangered "frog-mouthed turtle"?
Or some stupid park for families to picnic in?
No.
I care about power, you pinheads!
Oh, boy.
Nobody knows this turtle exists.
And nobody ever will.
There's about to be a riot out there.
I need you out front.
Okay.
No.
Hey, wait.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Please, please, please.
That was not real.
Trust me, there is no such thing as a frog-mouthed turtle.
He's right next to me, isn't he?
Okay.
- We did it, Yogi!
- Up high, Boo Boo!
- All right!
- We got it!
Yogi!
All right, and now....
Miss Moviemaker Lady.
He-hey, we did it.
Hey, Mr. Ranger!
- Come on, Boo Boo.
- Okay.
I was wrong, Yogi.
I say from here on, we just be proud of who we are, not to be afraid to fight for the things we're passionate about, like this park.
And Rachel.
And... pic-a-nic baskets?
And pic-a-nic baskets.
- Aw, come here!
- No, you don't have to...
Okay.
All right, that's...
I'm good.
Here you go, Boo Boo.
Take good care of 'im.
Hey, there, buddy.
No, no, no, no, no, I never took a kickback on anything in my entire career.
No one loves turtles more than I do.
And nature in general.
I love trees.
Oh, no, you don't!
- Gorilla?
- Himalayan snow leopard.
Huh.
Welcome to Jellystone, home of the frog-mouthed turtle.
And brochures.
I'm Ranger...
Jones.
Ah, yes, Jellystone Park.
A wonderful little piece of paradise.
Where families come and soak up the tranquility of nature.
It's a place that...
Huh?
Never mind.
Hey, hey, hey!
Hi.
Welcome.
Well, I am certainly glad that you are gonna be staying in Jellystone for a while.
And what animal will you be observing?
Well, Il thought I would observe the courting rituals of... the American ranger.
I happen to hear the American ranger is a... very charming, intelligent, attractive species.
One that always keeps his cool.
Even when basket-stealing bears push his buttons?
Listen, Yogi will be Yogi.
And I'm just not gonna let it bother me anymore.
Besides...
I have more important things to focus on.
Oh...
I...
Let's...
Let's try that again.
Afternoon, Mr. Ranger, sir!
Hi, Miss Movie Lady!
Yogi!
I love this place.
Yogi!
Hey!
NARRATOR:
Jellystone Park.
One of the nation's oldest and most beautiful stretches of wilderness.
For years, families have headed out from the busy city eager to enjoy a little camping, fishing and, of course, observing the park's natural wildlife.
Boo Boo, I think it's time I introduced myself to that pic-a-nic basket.
You know, Yogi, we could just hunt for food.
All the other animals do.
Boo Boo, a pic-a-nic basket has everything a bear needs.
And I'm not just talking about the treats and snack-type goodies.
No.
A pic-a-nic basket holds a lot more than that.
It holds dreams.
[whispering] What are we looking at?
I don't know.
Hook me in.
[IN NORMAL VOICE] You sure it'll work, Yogi?
Well, you know, Boo Boo, I'm smarter than the average bear!
[SHOUTING]
[chuckling]
All right!
[GASPS]
[SHOUTING]
[GRUNTS]
[chuckling]
[GROANS]
MAN:
Ranger Smith!
Sorry about that.
We got a 4-23 in Redwood Valley, sir.
-A what?
-A bear disturbance.
-l think it's probably-- -l know who it is.
Why didn't you just say "bear disturbance"?
Well, I....
Uh, well, it sounds cooler.
I mean, we're park rangers, sir.
You know:
"To protect and preserve."
Did you just make that motto up?
Yeah, I did.
Do you like it?
Ranger Jones, you know that, well, being a park ranger, it's not about mottos.
It's about keeping the park safe.
That's where the glory is.
Protecting all of this.
Yeah, I know.
Besides, that motto was still in the testing phase.
It's not like I made T-shirts or anything.
Heh, no, of course not.
Okay, I'm gonna deal with that 4-23.
Okay, copy that, sir.
Um, I'm actually gonna hop in the Armadillo, make some rounds.
Jones, you know that the Armadillo is for head ranger use only.
I might need it at any moment to deal with a park emergency.
Why don't you finish stacking those trail maps?
Yeah, sure.
Okay.
Yeah, because that's what future head rangers do, they stack maps.
Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy!
Our days of getting banged up to grab a meal are over, Boo Boo.
From now on, the pic-a-nic baskets are going to fall into our arms.
Soldering iron.
BOO BOO:
Here you go.
-Thank you.
Okay.
That should do it.
Test rock.
Okay, Yogi.
YOGI:
Weight sensor triggered.
Basket in position.
Launch spring starts coiling.
Firing pin drops.
And....
[BELL RINGS]
Bull's-eye!
I'm so smart it hurts!
You're standing on the soldering iron.
Or it's that.
[SHOUTING]
Hot, hot, hot!
There's the test rock.
Now we just wait here for a pic-a-nic basket to fall into our arms.
Are you sure about this, Yogi?
People seem to get pretty mad when you--
A genius never questions his instincts, Boo Boo.
When you have a mind like mine you can't blink or you'll put a kink in your think.
Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.
We've got our first customers.
And they have pie!
I wonder what kind it is.
smith:
Yogi, are you out here?
-lt's Mr. Ranger.
-Aah!
Get rid of the test rock.
Destroy the evidence. I was never here.
smith:
Look-
- Ow!
Hello, Mr. Ranger, sir.
Did you just--?
Did you guys--?
Did you--?
Oh, never mind.
Look, there was a complaint about a bear interfering with a family picnic.
I see.
And you'd like us to mount some sort of investigation?
No, I think it was you.
What?
!
How can you even think that?
Are you feverish?
Let me press my lips against your forehead.
Wait!
You're not pressing your lips against my forehead.
Hey, it's a lot better than the way they take my temperature.
[CHUCKLES]
No, look, Yogi, we've been over this many times.
Bears are supposed to avoid people, not run around stealing their food.
I agree, sir.
That's why my friend Boo Boo and I would never think of disturbing a family's pic-a-nic.
[BELL RINGS AND WOOD CLUNKS]
[WOMAN SCREAMS]
Huh.
It missed.
[GROANS]
Good day, Mr. Ranger, sir.
We'll keep our eyes peeled.
I wonder if he noticed the pie.
JONES [CHOPPY OVER RADIO]:
Ra-
- Smith.
You have a vis-
- Over.
Didn't understand a word of that, Jones.
-Sorry.
Some lady's here to see you.
-Send her in.
-Okay.
I'll be in the Armadillo.
-Or you could be....
-Map stacking?
-Map stacking.
-Ranger Smith?
-Yes.
-Hello. I'm Rachel Johnson.
-Hi.
I was hoping to talk to you about filming a documentary here.
Sure. I can handle you for that.
Handle that for you.
Sorry.
My work isn't-- My brain isn't working right.
-l must have inhaled some jimsonweed.
-Oh.
Datura stramonium.
It's known to cause delirium...
-...cramping and nausea.
Heh.
-Cramping and nausea.
You've read The North American Wilderness Guide.
Yeah, I like to highlight all the plants and animals I see.
-l like to-
- Me too.
-Ha, ha!
Yeah.
[smith STAMMERING]
Ranger Smith.
At your service.
You want to film a documentary in Jellystone?
Yes.
I sent you a letter about a month ago.
-Written on a piece of bark.
-That was you!
Yes. I'm sorry about that.
I was in Sumatra, living among the orangutans at the time and they get very nervous if they spot anything from the modern world.
Really?
Wow, that's amazing.
Then what did you use for ink?
Bird poop and spit.
Impressive.
So, what are you here to film?
Well, I was hoping to shoot a local species.
Something to really capture the beauty of a national park.
Terrific.
What animal were you thinking?
I heard you had an unusual brown bear.
-Brown bear?
-Yes.
One that talks?
Those are so rare.
-None that I can think of.
-Named Yogi?
Wears a hat and a tie?
No, that doesn't ring a bell.
I think he's standing on the roof, trying to steal your lunchbox.
YOGI:
I smell PB and J.
[YOGI shouting]
I'm all done.
Oh, right.
That Yogi.
Bankrupt?
No, no, no.
We're a city.
Cities don't go bankrupt.
They do when they're broke, sir.
We just have to find some money somewhere.
I'm about to run for governor.
How am I gonna do that when my own city is bankrupt?
Okay, yes.
Thank you.
-Here's the invoice, Mr. Mayor.
-Yikes!
Wow.
Ha.
I'm gonna pretend I didn't see that.
Just bill it to the city, okay?
Thank you.
Ugh.
How did we ever go so broke?
-l think we just spent too much.
-Hmm.
Is there anything we can sell?
You already sold the public golf course to condo developers two of the three fire stations to that frozen yogurt company.
You were selling the library, but it burned down.
Oh, yeah.
That was gonna be one of those make-your-own-doughnut places.
-No.
-Yeah.
-lf you could dream it up, you could make it.
-Ah.
Love those.
We gotta think of something here.
Well, if we don't have anything to sell, maybe we can profit off what we can't sell.
I don't understand those words.
Like when we sold the bottling rights to the water in Lake Beuclair.
-We made a fortune.
-Yeah.
Sinkhole Beuclair is a great place to throw old mattresses.
-Oh, yeah.
-Hmm.
We just don't have any more resources to exploit.
Or do we?
Jellystone.
If we rezone Jellystone Park as agricultural land, we can sell the logging rights.
Here.
This company says they'll give us thousands of dollars an acre just to cut down the trees or something.
That'll be enough to balance the budget and give each citizen a big fat check.
[laughing]
You have any idea how many votes that'll buy me?
-Enough to be the next governor?
-Exactly.
You're fine, Yogi.
It's just a few scrapes and bruises.
I don't know, Mr. Ranger.
I'm pretty sure I heard my spine snap.
Well, you wouldn't be able to stand.
And you wouldn't be able to eat.
I'm okay!
Yogi, Boo Boo, I would like to introduce you to Rachel Johnson who's here to make a nature documentary.
[GROWLS]
What the heck was that?
I was saying hello.
I lived in a den with brown bears for six months.
Only bear I've ever lived with is Boo Boo.
And he only makes that sound after he's eaten baked beans.
Heh, heh.
I have problems with baked beans.
And for a little bear, he makes a lot of stink.
Okay, I have some fantastic river otters you can film instead.
-Could get a hat and tie on the slow one.
-No, you know, I really, really like these two.
-Would you guys mind if I shoot you?
YOGI:
Huh?
[rapid FOOTSTEPS]
Yogi, I think she meant with a camera.
Yes.
Of course with a camera.
Heh-heh-heh.
I knew that.
But not just any camera.
This isn't gonna make me look fat, is it?
RACHEL:
No, you are gonna look great.
Okay, just a few more adjustments.
[whispering] Please, excuse the pre-tied bow tie.
My mornings are often rushed.
It's fine, Boo Boo.
This is going to be a whole new perspective for a documentary.
The Boo Boo cam will capture the true wilderness in all its natural glory.
No other human in sight.
That sounds like my apartment.
Ha, ha.
Uh, you know, because I live alone.
Well, plenty of women have tried to change that.
It's just, I haven't found one that--
-Likes you?
-What?
No.
No, that--
Will return your calls?
Can you stop helping, please?
Sir, I can see you like this lady.
But your courting rituals need work.
What you need to do is follow her around for two days making snorting sounds.
Then fight any male that looks at her.
And then, of course, urinate on her to mark her as your territory.
Works every time.
I got it under control, Yogi.
-Boo Boo, you're rolling.
-Cool.
Yogi Bear, a brown bear commonly found in North America and Alaska.
Weighing up to 1 800 pounds, brown bears are also the national animal of Finland.
I don't think you have to narrate.
But I liked where you were going with it, Boo Boo.
-l was hooked.
-Really?
Yes.
Now try to film from flattering angles, if you know what I mean.
Pic-a-nic baskets may be delicious on the lips, but they're a lifetime on the hips.
Oh, no.
Ranger Smith!
Ranger Smith.
The mayor's here.
What's he doing here?
Why didn't he give us more warning?
I have to secure the area.
All units, lock down the park.
Repeat, lock down the park.
Jones, you know I'm the only other ranger here, right?
Yeah.
-Ranger Smith, we need to talk.
-You could've just called.
BROWN:
Yeah, but I thought this would be more friendly.
I'm really working on my people skills.
Anyway, I am closing your park down.
-Okay.
-What?
Oh, yeah, this place just costs the city way too much money.
Jellystone hasn't made its operating budget in 1 0 years.
You know, it's hard to compete with all those amusement parks--
Oh, hey, you're not kidding.
Oh, have you guys been to Lincoln Log Land yet?
Oh, man, they have got a roller coaster there, it's made completely out of logs.
It's just like they rode in the pioneer days.
It's unbelievable.
Sir, Jellystone is special.
Okay?
It's turning 1 00 years old this very year.
Why, it's a landmark.
I would never let it be closed down.
Well, uh, you actually don't have a choice.
Have you read the city bylaws lately?
Chapter 6.
Section 73.
"Any municipal property that can't generate enough money to cover its operating budget can be rezoned for other uses."
And since Jellystone loses money every year, we're shutting it down.
Uh, sorry?
[BOTH CHUCKLE]
-l thought that went well.
CHIEF:
Yeah.
smith:
Just a second, Mr. Mayor.
Who says we can't cover our budget?
Park doesn't report earnings till next quarter.
Yeah, which is like one week away.
Come on, Smith.
You gotta be $20,000 in the hole.
We wish.
Yeah.
Try 30,562.
That's probably a couple hundred extra for the map stand.
I think it's confession time.
-l only pretended to fix it.
-Thanks, Jones.
Sounds like you're in pretty deep there, Smith.
Maybe we are.
But this is one of the last places families can go to be close to nature.
The world needs that.
Well, I'm not mayor of the world.
I'm mayor of this city.
And this city needs this park rezoned.
I'm sorry.
I feel awful about it.
Even though I look really good.
This is a new suit.
So, okay.
Maybe we don't have our operating budget today.
But you know what?
-A lot can happen in a week.
-All right.
Have it your way.
Take a week.
Hey, I'll even get you started.
What's the admission fee for one car again?
Four dollars.
Four dollars, huh?
Four whole dollars?
Well, that changes everything.
Oh, my goodness.
Well, I only need to come back in here like, uh, what, 1 0,000 more times?
[laughing]
In a week!
Do I have time for that?
-lmpossible.
-Oh, shoot.
[WEIRD AL yankovic'S "LASAGNA" playing ON STEREO]
You want-a some-a lasagna?
You hungry, buddy?
Of course!
I'm always hungry.
I was talking to my pet turtle.
Here you go.
That better not be my beefjerky.
[TURTLE chewing]
[BELCHES]
So, what's the big deal, Yogi?
This is the big deal, Boo Boo.
It's my masterpiece.
The Basket-Nabber 2000.
The most advanced pic-a-nic basket-stealing technology ever invented.
Wow.
Climb aboard.
This glider can steer dive, shoot rubber bands at pesky-type birds and even has an air bag.
Had an air bag.
Sorry, Yogi.
Not to worry.
We could cushion our landing with all the pic-a-nic baskets we swipe.
Now, how's that copilot seat feel?
A little wobbly, like it's not tied on very tight.
You won't feel that in the air.
Get ready to fly faster than the speed of sandwich, Boo Boo.
We're gonna break the pic-a-nic barrier.
smith:
Yogi!
-Uh-oh.
That's not his happy voice.
Don't move.
I'm switching the glider into stealth mode.
Stealth mode?
Wow.
How are you able to--?
Oh.
Ah, Mr. Ranger, sir.
Welcome.
Can I interest you in a sody pop?
-There you go.
-When did you steal our vending machine?
I, um-- l'm repairing it, sir.
This machine gives its sodas away for free when a bear kicks it.
Look, a camper has reported some missing fishing poles so I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say it was you.
Fishing poles?
Sir, I'm a bear.
If I wanted to catch fish, I would just use my....
Your paws, Yogi.
Isn't that kind of unsanitary?
What's that?
-What's what?
-That thing.
-What thing?
-The thing under the blanket.
-Blanket?
-The object right behind you.
Oh.
Oh, that.
Heh.
A sculpture.
I'm sculpting now.
Mostly landscapes.
And where's Boo Boo?
-France.
-What?
-That's not close by, is it?
-No.
Then he's in the bathroom.
-Excuse me.
-Wait!
[STAMMERlNG]
Hey, this isn't the bathroom.
I'm telling you, Mr. Ranger, it's not for stealing pic-a-nic baskets.
It says "Basket-Nabber 2000" right here, Yogi.
I do regret calling it that now.
I know I'm always saying, "Stay away from the campers."
This is different.
Jellystone is in real trouble.
If I don't raise $30,000 in a week, this park's getting rezoned.
Rezoned?
What does that mean?
It means the park won't be a park anymore.
The city will use this land for something else.
So we have got to do everything we can to help save it.
Which means you have gotta stop stealing food so that campers will leave here happy.
But they do leave here happy.
Getting your food stolen by Yogi Bear is special.
People come here for that.
It's like catching a foul ball at a baseball game.
Nope.
It's like getting your food stolen at a baseball game.
Come on, Yogi.
Would it really be so hard to be a regular bear?
You know, to forage for food, to walk around on all fours to hibernate a little, or a lot.
If nature had meant for me to be a regular bear it wouldn't have given me such a good thought-cooker, sir.
I can't help it if my melon is full of smart juice.
Yogi, your melon is hurting this park.
There are repercussions to stealing people's picnic baskets.
Not in my experience, sir.
[MECHANISM ticking]
[BELL RINGS]
[GRUNTS]
On the other hand--
[SCREAMS]
Ranger Smith, mind if I borrow the 'dilla?
It's an emergency.
Somebody parked without parking decals.
Jones, I would really prefer it if you focused on just maintaining the park instead.
Let me deal with the visitors until you've had more experience.
Sorry, sir.
Guess that's just the Eagle Scout in me, you know?
Always wanting to be in control, be a leader.
Live up to this fanny pack full of merit badges.
You know that fanny pack is for first aid supplies, right?
A merit badge in first aid is the only supply I need, sir.
Right, but it might not be the only supply a hurt person needs.
You seen Rachel?
Yeah, I saw her.
She was heading up to Lookout Mountain.
She can't be far. I'll drive.
Let's roll.
Jones.
The sprawling beauty of Jellystone Park.
A timeless stretch of wilderness untouched by man.
Oh.
Ranger Smith.
Wow, heh.
What's with the fancy outfit?
Dress greens.
I always wear dress greens in the evening.
You know, in case there's, you know- l don't know how to talk to girls.
-Oh.
Why do you think I spend so much time with animals?
All you have to do is scratch their backside and you've got a friend for life.
Try that with people and all of a sudden you're the weird girl on the bus that nobody wants to sit next to.
Um, uh, listen. I was wondering, you know, if you were--
I mean, it's getting late and we could, uh-- If you want.
I mean, it's not that-
- You don't-
- It's--
You know, it's not a worry.
Don't worry.
Did you just ask me to dinner?
Yes. I did.
Heh.
-Good, you got that, huh?
-Yes.
I just thought, well, it's getting late.
I happen to know this great place.
-Very gourmet.
-Really?
Where?
So close you won't believe it.
Wow, how did you ever find this place?
This is a four-star porch.
And fresh from the hot plate, I give you...
-...rack of Spam.
-Oh.
Wow.
Maybe "gourmet" was a bit of a stretch.
No, it actually looks wonderful.
Great.
You know, this really is a peaceful place.
It's something, isn't it?
I pretty much grew up here.
My father was a ranger when I was a kid and he turned this park into the number one tourist destination in the state.
I mean, it was a park, you know?
Like families came by the hundreds swam in the streams, hiked on the trails.
It was really something.
This is really good.
Anyway, I don't know.
Maybe it's my fault.
I spent so many years learning everything I could about the park so I'd be a better ranger.
Maybe instead, I should have come up with a gimmick to get people to come here.
You know, change the name to Extreme Jellystone.
-l think that it's perfect just the way it is.
-You do?
You're right.
Absolutely.
There's no better place on earth.
YOGI:
Hey, Mr. Ranger.
-Except a place without him.
Evening, Mr. Ranger, sir.
Madame Moviemaker Lady.
And yes, I'm using the fancy tense to show you the utmost respect.
Hi.
Ha, ha.
What do you want, Yogi?
Well, I was thinking about the park's prickly predicament and I would like to do my part to help.
This is all the money I have saved.
Almost $1 00.
I was going to use it on myself, but I'd rather donate it to Jellystone.
Well, thank you, Yogi.
That's--
That is very sweet.
-Where does a bear get money from?
-That brown box by the parking lot.
The park donation box.
Yep.
But I want you to have it.
Consider it a gift to Jellystone.
That won't be hard.
Look, guys, I appreciate the effort.
But what this park needs is visitors and lots of them.
Well, I can help you there, sir.
Just make me a headliner.
I will rock this place.
-Kick it, Boo Boo.
-Kicking it.
[SIR MlX-A-LOT'S "BABY GOT BACK" playing]
I like big butts and I cannot lie You other brothers can't deny
That when a girl walks in With a itty-bitty waist
And a round thing in your face You get sprung
[music STOPS]
That's not gonna work either, Yogi.
You're right.
We need something flashier than music.
Not a problem.
I've got this water-skiing routine that will change the face of entertainment.
Got a little of everything.
Music, stunts, magic.
-And I jump over Boo Boo at the end.
-No, you don't.
-l want to try it.
-l don't care.
I hate to interrupt, but you're not gonna water-ski or dance or do anything that might disturb the campers, okay?
If what you really want to do is help save this park you will lay low, stay away from people.
Think you can do that for me?
You have my word, Mr. Ranger.
I will be seen, but not heard.
Or seen.
Fine.
Huh?
You guys done with that Spam?
-Get out of here.
-Okay.
Sheesh!
Hey.
What's this?
Seasons pass applications.
Unfortunately, not a lot of takers on those.
Fifty bucks for an entire year?
Including camping fees?
That's a bargain.
If this were a place people wanted to visit throughout the year.
Maybe Yogi was on to something.
-You said the park was turning 1 00, right?
-Right.
Well, a big event could really pull people in.
Yeah, you're right.
We could have, like, a moss collection day or a big squirrel chase.
-Or....
-Fireworks.
Yes.
Exactly.
Why didn't I think of that?
We could host a big centennial festival.
People always show up for fireworks.
If even half of the people buy season passes the park makes enough money to stay open.
Right.
Let's get the word out.
I think I can help with that.
[PEOPLE chattering INDISTINCTLY]
That is great.
How did we pay for it?
We didn't.
It was some fast-food restaurant but I rearranged the letters right before the plane took off.
[BOTH CHUCKLE]
You're very cool, Rachel Johnson.
You're pretty cool yourself.
I do have my own kind of natural swagger.
[SCREAMS]
Jellystone National Park, 1 00th year anniversary.
There'll be fireworks.
Just stay calm, Jones.
You should be patrolling in the Armadillo making park-impacting decisions, but--
-Hey, 1 00th year anniversary.
-Thanks.
But you're not there yet.
You still have to follow orders.
Even if those orders make you look like a giant Cheez-It.
Mr. Mayor!
Hi, Mr. Mayor.
Why is it only going halfway down again?
Doesn't make any-
- No!
Oh, okay. ls it a double tap or do I have to press it--?
-Oh, dang it!
-l got it, sir.
Yeah.
That's exactly what I did.
Let me see one of those fliers.
"Come celebrate Jellystone's 1 00th anniversary with fireworks and fun."
"And receive $1 0 off a season pass"?
He's gonna try to make the budget selling season passes.
[BOTH GROAN]
Yeah, ugh. lt's not a very good idea, in my opinion.
But nobody consulted me, because my job is just to maintain the park which is basically poking trash with a stick.
Yeah.
Yeah, why is a guy with your talent doing this insulting grunt work?
You should be running a park.
Yeah, but Ranger Smith says I have to pay my dues.
-Excuse me?
-What?
-He has to pay his dues?
Ha.
-Ha, ha.
Nobody pays dues anymore.
You gotta be in charge now while you still know everything.
-That's what I've been saying.
-Yeah.
Buddy, if it was up to me, you would be the head ranger of Jellystone already.
-You'd put me in charge?
-ln a second.
Yes.
You know, if this centennial festival didn't work out, I probably could relocate Smith.
You know, uh, maybe you could help me with that.
Make sure it doesn't succeed?
Wait, you mean, like, sabotage it?
No.
Oh, no, no, no.
No, I want you to be head ranger.
It just so happens that the only way to do that is to bring down this festival.
But spend the rest of your life as second-in-command if you like.
That's fine.
It's a perfectly valid life choice.
Well, you just think about it and give me a call, okay?
Here's my card.
So long.
Hey.
Now why is it doing that?
No.
Boy Scouts are loyal, thrifty, kind....
Hey, you're back.
Hey, thanks for getting those fliers out.
Let me tell you, this festival is gonna be huge.
Hey, Ranger Smith, how long do you think until I reach head ranger status?
Oh, no time at all.
I did it in 1 2 short years.
Ha, okay.
Are you serious?
Just be patient, Jones.
It'll be here before you know it.
This festival's gonna be great!
I can't wait 1 2 years.
[PEOPLE CHEERING AND LAUGHING]
Seasons pass order forms.
Seasons pass order forms.
Thank you.
Seasons pass order forms, $1 0 off today.
Ah, enjoy.
I can't take it, Boo Boo.
Two days without a tasty treat to eat?
And I have to sit up here while they're having a "happy birthday, Jellystone" party?
[sniffing]
And they have doughnuts.
Doughnuts!
BOO BOO [OVER radio]:
Yogi, what are you doing?
-Yogi!
-l'm going.
Hey.
Wait.
Don't do it, Yogi.
You promised Mr. Ranger.
You're right. I'm losing control, Boo Boo.
I don't know who's steering the ship.
Here.
I want you to handcuff me to this tree and not unlock it no matter what I say.
Okay, Yogi.
-Okay, unlock me.
-Huh?
It was a bad idea.
Unlock me.
[GRUNTlNG]
Unlock me!
[growling]
Okay.
Here you go.
JONES:
Folks, I hate to say this, but there are no spots left.
Forecast called for thunderstorms.
Severe lightning.
I fear for your young ones.
[CAR HORN honking]
We're out of fireworks, I'm afraid.
It's just sparklers left.
Oh, no.
You look nice.
Your napkin matches your tie.
I don't need you to kiss up to me.
Got this guy for that.
That's a good point, sir.
You were gonna handle this situation, yet there are quite a few people here.
Sir, I tried.
All last night I spent taking down fliers.
I blocked the entrance with a vehicle to back up traffic.
I hung up "rabid squirrel" signs everywhere.
Those were hand-drawn.
-Nothing is working.
-You need to think of something, don't you?
Or maybe you're just not head ranger material.
Mr. Mayor.
Mayor's yes man.
So glad you could join us.
I saved you a nice spot next to the porta-potties.
Oh, well, thank you.
Well, that's very thoughtful.
You know, I'm just so glad that these festivities are going so well, Smith.
I just hope nothing goes wrong.
[HORN honking]
We are gonna pull this off, Jonesy.
I've seen hundreds of people filling out seasons pass order forms.
The weather's great.
The fireworks, ready to go.
Even Yogi's staying out of the way.
Yogi.
[GROANING]
Hey, guys.
Sorry, just wandering around, bored out of my mind.
Bored?
But the 1 00th anniversary extravaganza's going on.
Yeah, more like 1 00th anniversary lame-aganza.
You know, because it's so lame.
People see fireworks every day in the city.
They thought they'd see something different here.
I knew it.
I should be out there doing my water-ski routine.
I'm a shining star and Ranger Smith is holding me back.
I don't know, Yogi.
Mr. Ranger is usually right about these things.
No, Boo Boo, Ranger Smith is in denial.
I mean, he's lost it, you know?
I saw him a couple days ago.
He was filling his pockets with dirt.
He said he's gonna start moving the park to his apartment piece by piece.
-How big is his apartment?
-There's still time.
I won't be able to do the half-hour artistic program but that was more for me anyway.
These people need the razzle-dazzle.
I don't think we've practiced the razzle-dazzle.
You're not supposed to, Boo Boo.
That's where it gets the razzle.
Yogi, I really don't think we should--
Boo Boo, you've tried to stop my brilliant ideas with common sense a thousand times.
Has it ever worked?
No.
Then let's go, go, go.
What does that taste like?
Unemployment?
-l'm sorry.
-Yeah.
Thanks again for helping with the fireworks.
I don't know where Jones disappeared to.
My pleasure.
You know, um, Rachel, I've been wanting to tell you...
-...well, how much I--
-Ranger--
No, please, let me get through this.
I'm not very good with words.
But I have never felt so gushy.
Ha-ha-ha.
-You know?
-Ranger--
You know what I did?
I went and I wrote a song about you.
It's like this:
[humming]
Oh, no.
[singing] I saw you at the station
Had a heart palpitation
My sickness was love And you're the medication
Rachel
-Rachel
-The microphone is on.
smith:
And it comes around again
Rachel, Rachel, Rachel
The microphone is on.
Yes, the mic--
[CLEARS THROAT THEN LAUGHS]
Hi.
Hello and welcome to the 1 00th anniversary of Jellystone!
[cheering]
Thank you.
It is so wonderful to see so many people here today.
I've noticed many of you filling out your seasons pass order forms.
We're more than happy to collect those after the fireworks.
But first, please, sit back, get comfortable and enjoy the show!
-Terrific.
-Mr.
Mayor?
[POISON'S "nothin' BUT A GOOD time" playing ON STEREO]
That's not the right music.
I'll take it from here, Mr. Ranger!
Oh, no.
Full speed ahead, Boo Boo.
Okay.
Not bad, eh, Boo Boo?
Looking good, Yogi.
-This cannot be happening.
-Oh, it's happening.
[YOGI STAMMERING]
Hello, Jellystone!
[CROWD CHEERING]
No, don't encourage him!
They love me. I can do no wrong.
Watch this.
All right, Boo Boo!
Turn up the heat!
Phase two, go.
I'm an unstoppable water-skiing machine.
[laughing]
Ta-da!
Oh, wait.
There's more.
How about if I heat things up?
[smith WHlMPERS]
[GROANING]
Don't need nothin' but a good time
And it don't get better than this
Yogi!
Yogi, your cape.
I know.
It is magnificent.
And on fire.
Huh?
Fire!
[GROANING]
-Turn the boat!
-Huh?
-Turn, Boo Boo!
-Hang on, Yogi!
Too much razzle!
[CROWD screaming]
[GASPS]
-Nice one.
-Thanks.

Jump!

[ALL GASP]
[MURMURlNG]
Let's go.
[screaming AND SHOUTING]
MAN:
Out of my way!
[chuckling]
This could not have gone more perfectly.
Hey, you got a little, uh....
Never mind.
Let's go.
[SIGHS]
[WOOD snapping AND CREAKING]
Mr. Ranger, I thought--
Yogi, that's the problem.
All the thinking.
Hey, you know what would be great?
If you didn't think.
If you could just be a regular bear.
You know, sitting in the woods, minding his own business.
But no, you're different.
You're smart.
And you'd rather spend your days being selfish and destructive while everyone else pays the price.
But I guess it wasn't enough, screwing up my life.
No, this time you had to go and bring down this entire park.
So tell me, Yogi how smart are you now?
Hey, there!
That was quite a show you put on yesterday.
Ha-ha-ha.
I can't wait to see what you do with this.
That's your new assignment.
Evergreen Park.
Oh, I think you're just going to find it delightful.
Oh, and, uh, Ranger Jones is gonna be taking over here.
Ranger Jones?
Well, I have got a press conference to plan.
You see, it turns out I've saved the city.
Don't forget to vote, my friend.
Brown for governor!
Ha-ha-ha.
He's not gonna vote for me, is he?
Uh, no.
You did everything you could.
Doesn't matter.
This park needed a ranger who could make it popular again.
I'm just some guy who knows how old every tree is.
Fat lot of good that did Jellystone.
Face it.
You and I are just two people who care about things that nobody else does and that's why we're alone.
Or maybe that's why we found each other.
Did you ever think of that?
Rachel, you and this park have one thing in common.
You both deserve a better man than me.
I can't believe he's really gone.
Yogi, are you okay?
I'm done being special, Boo Boo.
Ranger Smith was right.
My whole life, I've been different.
But it's done nothing but hurt people.
The world would be better off if I was only as smart as the average bear.
Yogi, what are you doing?
I'm leaving, Boo Boo.
-l am going to forage for food in the wild.
-Huh?
Might even catch some fish.
With my paws.
[SIGHS]
I'm just gonna grab a little something for the road.
Some chips and soda.
And this.
Peach pie.
Any more of that casserole?
Top shelf.
I'll be out there.
Fending for myself.
Foraging for food in the wild.
[METAL CLANKING]
Goodbye, horsepower limiter.
There's a new head ranger in town.
Let's see what you got.
[GRUNTlNG]
Perfect.
[sobbing]
I'm sorry, Ranger Smith.
No more food.
No more pic-a-nickers.
How could this get any worse?
[THUNDER booming]
Oh.
Ah, Evergreen Park.
Yes, it is simply delightful.
[giggling]
-Come on.
-l've got it, sir.
This is unbelievable.
Ah, Evergreen Park.
Lovely, isn't it?
This isn't a park.
I can barely breathe in here.
Look at these trees.
They're all plastic.
Oh, no, they're real.
It's just years of smog and pollution have left a plastic-like coating on them.
Think people will be happy you're closing the most beautiful park in the state?
Well, they will be when they find out it's making the city rich and giving each citizen a check for $1 000.
How is that even possible?
Oh, well, it turns out that there has been some agricultural interest in the park.
And it's a lot more profitable than people in station wagons making s'mores.
[laughing]
Have a good day, Ranger Smith.
I hate this car. I hate it.
[GRUNTS]
[CHAINSAWS buzzing]
Yeah!
Oh, hey, there he is.
Ha-ha-ha.
Whoa, hey, Mr. Mayor!
I, uh....
Just finishing some stamping.
You are doing great, Jones.
I knew you were the guy for this job.
Quick thing.
You'll probably notice some giant trucks rumbling by.
We're just clearing a little patch of trees for my press conference.
No big deal.
Um, wait, you're cutting down trees?
Oh, yeah.
Well, just a few.
It's nothing to worry about.
Actually gonna improve the park quite a bit.
I'll bet one of the first things you noticed as head ranger is that you need more clear spaces here, and you are absolutely right.
Now you can host concerts and Boy Scout jamborees.
That's a pretty smart move there, Head Ranger Jones.
I have some other park improvements I want to run by you.
Oh, splendid, yes.
I think I have a few moments to hear those.
Look into the security arrangements for tomorrow.
I don't want any surprises.
I'll hear what Ding-Dong has to say.
What do you got?
I'm hungrier than the average bear.
I wish I could find a bush that tasted like birthday cake.
Gotcha.
[GROANS]
Pretend it's a gummy worm.
Pretend it's a gummy worm.
[GASPS]
Yogi, I've been looking everywhere for you.
Not now, Boo Boo.
I'm busy foraging.
[GROANS]
[SHOUTS]
Come on, Yogi.
Jellystone is in trouble.
We need your help.
Nothing I can do, Boo Boo.
I'm average now.
My brain is out of business.
I wouldn't even be standing if my paws didn't hurt.
Quit feeling sorry for yourself.
You know you're not an average bear.
Hey, hey, Boo Boo.
You're right, I'm not.
I failed at that too.
Hey, come back here.
You've gotta save Jellystone.
YOGI:
What are you doing?
I'm not--
Yogi, you have to use your smarts for good.
And if you can't see that, maybe you are just an average bear.
Come on.
[GRUNTlNG]
Now do you understand?
What's going on, Boo Boo?
I don't know.
But whatever it is I think they're just getting started.
Boo Boo get my collar.
Nobody is gonna hurt Jellystone.
Where are we going, Yogi?
We can't get Jellystone back alone, Boo Boo.
My thinker is good, but Ranger Smith's is better.
He was going to a place called Evergreen Park.
That's right. ln the city.
The city?
That's a long walk.
Don't be silly, Boo Boo.
I've already got a smarty-smart cheat to keep our feet off the street.
Get ready for it.
Here it comes.
Run, Boo Boo, run!
Hurry, Boo Boo.
I think we gotta jump for it.
Ready?
All aboard.
Good.
Yogi, grab my paw.
[GROANING]
[GRUNTlNG]
Sorry.
[YOGI shouting]
Boo Boo, Boo Boo, Boo Boo!
I gotta get--!
I guess it makes a stop here.
Yup.
Looks like Evergreen Park is about two miles away from here.
Two miles?
I'll have to tap into my emergency rations.
Snack break.
Come on, Yogi.
We need to keep moving.
It's not that far and it's all downhill.
Downhill?
Excuse me, Mr. Dirty Shopper.
Any chance my friend and I might borrow your wheely-basket?
Is that chocolate?
[YOGI AND BOO BOO laughing]
Okay, Boo Boo, keep it steady.
I'm okay, Ma.
Just--
Yeah, no, it's not Jellystone, but at least there's nothing here to drive me crazy.
-Hey, Mr. Ranger.
-Hey, Yogi.
[CART CRASHES]
All right, Ma, I gotta call you back.
What are you guys doing here?
We need your help, Mr. Ranger, sir.
But don't worry, my days of goofing things up for you are over.
MAN:
Hey, move that shopping cart!
[SHOUTING]
I'm okay!
I'm just gonna put this over here.
What do you want?
I don't have a life left for you to ruin anymore.
Sir, I know I messed things up and I'm sorry.
I never meant to.
You and Boo Boo are the best friends I ever had.
And I've never done anything but think of myself.
And now Jellystone is just gonna be a big field of stumps.
What?
They've started cutting down the trees.
"Agricultural interest" is logging.
Oh, no, not our Jellystone.
We have to save it, sir.
I don't think we can save it, Yogi.
I'm no smarter than you.
I lost Jellystone.
I lost Rachel.
It's over.
Mr. Ranger, I've learned two things from stealing pic-a-nic baskets.
One:
light mayonnaise is not nearly as good as regular mayonnaise.
And two: you can't fail if you never stop trying.
You have to fight for the things you love whether it's a park, a girl or a roast beef sandwich.
Don't give up now.
We're all Jellystone's got.
You're right, Yogi.
Jellystone's too important to give up on.
We gotta try.
Come on.
-Shotgun.
-Aw.
I never thought I'd see this.
Happy 1 00th anniversary, Jellystone.
Isn't that Miss Movie Lady?
RACHEL:
I gotta get in there.
You don't understand.
Let me in, please.
No can do.
Park is closed to the public until the press conference.
Mayor's orders.
Then go talk to him.
Tell him what I told you.
I'm sorry.
I don't really take orders from a--
I lived with gorillas, pal.
I know rage.
You do not want me to go gorilla on you.
[SCREAMS]
Uh, I'll speak to the mayor.
-Thank you.
-Okay.
Rachel.
Ranger Smith.
I didn't think I'd ever see you again.
I know.
I don't know what I was thinking.
I think you're perfect.
I think any guy in the world would be lucky just to stand next to you.
You really mean that?
Of course I do.
It's just, when I lost Jellystone, I felt like such a failure.
But losing you has felt much, much worse.
I'm like....
I'm like a genus without a phylum.
That's the sweetest thing anyone's ever said to me.
-So, um, we're still here.
YOGI:
Mm-hm.
Oh, right.
Ahem.
So, what are you doing here?
-Come on, I'll show you.
-Okay.
I was reviewing the documentary footage from Boo Boo's camera and I saw this.
Oh, my.
I see it.
I have a bald spot back there!
I'm not talking about you, Yogi.
I'm talking about this.
Yeah, it's my pet turtle.
He hangs out at the cave all the time.
True.
You know they don't come out of that shell?
I tried one time to see what one would look like without it.
But, nope, they're sewn in.
This is no regular turtle.
See the bulging frog-like eyes and the really wide mouth?
A frog-mouthed turtle?
Yup, Rafetus swinhoei.
smith:
But those are extinct.
For a hundred years, but apparently one still exists.
And he lives in there.
But they won't let me through the gates to go find him.
But if Jellystone has an endangered species living in it, then--
It has to be protected as a park.
That's the law.
That turtle can save this park.
Now I feel kinda bad about using him as a foot stool.
CHIEF:
You've seen the filmmaker?
Well, we spoke.
About extinct turtles.
You're telling me there is an extinct turtle living here in the park?
According to Miss Johnson's film, there is.
An extinct turtle?
That's great.
Visitors will come from miles around to see an endangered species.
Yes, they will, and that is great.
We need to find this turtle.
Just to keep it safe.
Have a vet check it out.
The whole deal.
The sooner we get to him the better.
Oh, we need a head ranger who's good enough to find it.
Someone who thinks like a turtle.
I am that head ranger.
Well, then why are you still here?
He's back.
Come on.
You need to let us in this park.
That turtle needs protection.
Don't worry about the turtle.
We're handling it.
We'll make sure he's put in a nice zoo.
No.
A turtle that's endangered can't be removed from its natural habitat.
It's against federal law.
It is?
Wow, I've never heard of that law in chapter 4, subsection 6 of the Wildlife Protection Mandate.
Don't worry, Mr. Ranger, sir.
That turtle is safe.
These people have no idea where my cave is.
The turtle's in the talking bear's cave.
JONES [OVER radio]:
Copy.
Wow, that backfired.
Okay.
You know what?
Fine,
You win.
What are you doing?
I have a plan.
One of the advantages of having lived here since I was a kid is I know this park like the back of my hand.
Let's go!
Hold on, boys.
All right.
Hey, there, little buddy.
Hello, there.
Uh-oh.
Sorry about that.
-Mayor Brown.
-This had better be good, Jones.
JONES:
I found the turtle.
He was in Boo Boo's sleeping bag.
But now I have him secure at the picnic area.
Jones, you're a hero.
Sit tight.
My chief of staff is on his way to get him.
Copy that.
Head Ranger Jones over and out.
smith:
He found the turtle.
Dang it.
Can't cross those rapids.
There's no way to get to him from here.
Well, there is one way.
There it is.
My masterpiece.
-You really think you can pull this off?
-l know I can, sir.
I'm gonna snatch that basket-type turtle box and fly away like a fuzzy bird.
And I've got the best copilot a basket-snatching machine could have.
-l don't know how to fly this thing.
-Well, you'll pick it up as we go.
smith:
Okay.
Look, just be careful, okay, Yogi?
Copy that, ground control.
Basket-Nabber 2000 ready for takeoff.
-Flight systems check.
Boo Boo?
-What?
-Can you reach the pedals?
-lf I point my toes.
Flight systems are go.
Remember what I told you about flying gliders, Yogi.
Don't fight the wind.
As long as the wind wants me to snatch up that turtle, we'll get along just fine.
-All right.
YOGI:
Start pedaling, Boo Boo.
All right.
Here goes.
YOGI:
Hold on, Boo Boo.
Fasten your seat belt.
But there isn't one.
YOGI:
Here we go!
BOO BOO:
Oh, Yogi!
The wind should carry you south!
We'll meet you there!
Take your time, Mr. Ranger.
This machine is equipped with landing gear.
We'll touch down as soft as a feather.
Whoops.
This is your captain speaking.
We'll reach our turtle target in about two minutes.
So let's go ahead and start the beverage service.
-Yogi, look out.
-Aah!
-Trees!
-Yes, trees!
[BOTH SCREAMING]
I got it.
I got it.
I got it.
I don't got it!
BOO BOO:
Pull up.
-Hey!
-Pull up!
You did it, Yogi.
Oh.
Yeah.
Ha-ha-ha.
Great job, Jones.
I'll get this guy to the city zoo.
-The city zoo?
-Yep.
They got a nice spot ready in the reptile house.
The city zoo doesn't have a reptile house.
They're building one.
-Who is?
-Builders.
Sure you're trying to protect the turtle?
Yeah, we love turtles.
Then you won't mind if I hold onto him until I notify the Wildlife Federation, right?
All right.
You're gonna find this out in a few hours anyway, so I might as well tell you.
We gotta lose this turtle to sell logging rights to the park.
Logging?
The whole park?
Yeah, but who cares?
It's still a park, just without trees.
And they'll grow back.
Yeah, in like 200 years.
It doesn't matter.
Your career is what matters.
Ha-ha-ha.
Turtle target acquired.
I need 20 more feet of altitude.
Engage the hand pedals.
You couldn't put the hand pedals by you?
There's a suggestion box behind the seat, Boo Boo.
[GROANS]
Wait, you don't want to approach him like that.
He's poisonous.
He's in a basket.
But he can spit.
Poison.
He'll aim at your eyes.
Melt them out of your head.
-l'm telling you, that turtle is deadly.
-What are you looking at?
-Hook me in, Boo Boo.
-Okay.
And fire!
Here you go.
Huh?
Yogi, wait!
Here I come!
He's going for the turtle.
-Mind if I borrow this?
-Hey!
[YOGI LAUGHS]
Look, Boo Boo!
We got the turtle!
Hey, why aren't you in your seat?
That bear knows how to steal a basket.
Everybody after that glider now!
I'm not gonna let a bear make me look bad.
Been there, buddy.
We're drifting too far right.
I wanna get us outside the park.
Don't fight the wind, Yogi.
Remember what Miss Movie Lady said about--
Never mind.
YOGI:
Hang on, Boo Boo.
-What do we do now?
Did you check the safety manual?
It's just a picture of us screaming.
[BOTH SCREAMING]
We've got to deject, Boo.
Don't you mean eject?
Eject is up.
Deject is down.
In case of emergency your seat can also be used as a flotation device!
[YOGI laughing]
[GRUNTlNG]
Hey, told you.
Nothing to worry about.
I actually think I wasn't worried enough.
Let me see how our little passenger is doing.
Wonder why they call him a frog-mouthed turtle anyway?
Hey!
smith:
Hey, guys, over here!
Yogi, grab the branch.
Got you, Mr. Ranger, sir.
[smith AND RACHEL GRUNT]
-Welcome aboard.
smith:
Yogi.
We were trying to get you off the raft.
Yeah, that makes more sense.
You guys did it.
You saved him.
[CAR HORN HONKS]
Oh, no.
They're gonna catch us downstream.
I'm on it.
No, Yogi, don't.
Problem solved.
They can't catch us now.
Yeah, because now we are headed straight for the Jellyjarring Rapids.
[GRUNTS]
-Grab a paddle.
-Tuck your head in, little buddy.
Brace yourselves.
Oh, come on, turtle.
Don't worry, I put safety belts in this raft for just such an occasion.
You better hang on.
Mr. Ranger said--
YOGI:
We're gonna be fine, Boo Boo.
Just sit back and let Mother Nature carry us to--
[ALL SCREAMING]
I think Mother Nature's kind of cranky today.
You okay, Yogi?
Fine!
Turtle!
YOGI:
Who's that?
I can't see.
Come here, turtle.
-Got him.
smith:
Good work, Boo Boo.
We made it through the rapids.
Yeah, but that means the falls are just up ahead.
Hold on!
[screaming]
Yogi.
Yogi.
Now who says there are no rides at Jellystone?
Yeah, you've definitely got the thrill part down.
ANNOUNCER:
Please, take your seats.
The press conference is about to begin.
That's over a mile away.
We're never gonna make that in time.
[ALL GASP]
-Ranger Jones?
-l messed up pretty bad, sir.
-l know. lt's okay.
-l wanted to be head ranger.
Because you're a good head ranger and I value leadership.
I have a merit badge--
Can we talk later?
We're pressed for time.
Yes.
Get in.
[SIREN wailing]
YOGI:
Boo Boo!
Boo Boo!
Wait up!
smith:
Well, well.
Guess who we found.
Starts with T and ends with a-- "Urtle"?
It's over.
Call off the logging.
The law says this park is now a protected nature preserve.
You think I care about what the law says?
Or about some endangered "frog-mouthed turtle"?
Or some stupid park for families to have a picnic in?
I care about power, you pinheads!
And I'm gonna get it.
Nobody knows this turtle exists.
And nobody ever will.
You found the turtle.
Get this thing out of here before anybody else sees it.
-Rachel!
-Oh!
Yogi!
BOO BOO:
Yogi, here!
Thank you.
-Yogi.
-l'm sorry.
He was open.
Ha, ha.
Now if you'll excuse me, I have a press conference.
I can still tell them what you did.
Oh, yeah?
Without that turtle or a scrap of evidence, go right ahead.
Well, you might as well tell them Bigfoot is here.
Ha-ha-ha.
And do yourself a favor, there, ranger.
Try to keep your dignity.
It's all you have left.
You know what?
I'm taking care of this thing myself this time.
That's the only way to make sure the job is done right.
But that's why I'm the mayor's right-hand man, right?
Because I don't make mistakes.
Hey, you know, people are wondering:
"Why should I vote for Mayor Brown to be governor?"
Well, how about this:
Mayor Brown just turned the city's budget from a deficit into a surplus!
And put $1 000 into the pocket of every citizen of this city!
Now before I sign the paperwork that will save the city why don't you all take a look at my first campaign ad for governor?
ANNOUNCER:
Mayor Brown, the right choice for governor.
We're out of time.
Must be something we can do.
Anybody have any ideas?
Well, I guess this is going to be a pretty sad documentary, huh?
Are you--?
is he still filming?
I needed more footage, so I told him to keep it rolling.
I can plug that into the video feed right up there.
I just need a way to distract the guards.
I think we can take care of that.
ANNOUNCER:
He supports public safety.
[JOURNEY'S "DON'T STOP believing" playing ON TV]
All right, hurry up, people.
Focus.
Let's go save those orphans.
YOGI:
Hey, hey, hey, check this out!
-Kick it, Boo Boo.
-Kicking it.
Don't stop believing
[laughing]
Hold on to that feeling
ANNOUNCER:
He's tough on crime.
[SHOUTS]
Hey, hey, hey, look at this.
Keep your eye on the little bear.
Look at the skills.
Amazing!
[GRUNTlNG]
ANNOUNCER:
And here's what Mayor Brown proudly has to say about protecting our natural resources.
[music STOPS]
You think I care about what the law says?
Or about some endangered "frog-mouthed turtle"?
-Some stupid park for families to picnic in?
-No.
No.
No. I care about power, you pinheads!
Oh, boy.
Nobody knows this turtle exists.
And nobody ever will.
[BOOING AND jeering]
[laughing]
There's about to be a riot out there.
I need you out front.
[GRUNTS]
Okay.
No.
Hey, wait.
Wait, wait, wait.
Please, please, please.
That was not real.
Trust me, there is no such thing as a frog-mouthed turtle.
He's right next to me, isn't he?
Okay.
-We did it, Yogi!
-Up high, Boo Boo!
-All right!
JONES:
We got it!
Yogi!
All right, and now....
Miss Moviemaker Lady.
smith:
Hey, we did it.
[laughing]
Hey, Mr. Ranger!
RACHEL:
Come on, Boo Boo.
-Okay.
I was wrong, Yogi.
I say from here on, we just be proud of who we are and fight for the things we're passionate about, like this park.
And Rachel.
And pic-a-nic baskets?
And pic-a-nic baskets.
-Aw, come here!
-No, you don't have to--
Okay.
All right, that's--
I'm good.
[CROWD chattering]
RACHEL:
Here you go, Boo Boo.
Take good care of him.
Hey, there, buddy.
No, no, no, I never took a kickback on anything in my entire career.
No one loves turtles more than I do.
And nature in general. I love trees.
Oh, no, you don't!
[GROWLS]
Gorilla?
Himalayan snow leopard.
Huh.
Welcome to Jellystone, home of the frog-mouthed turtle.
And brochures.
I'm Ranger Jones.
NARRATOR:
Ah, yes, Jellystone Park.
A wonderful little piece of paradise.
Where families come and soak up the tranquility of nature.
It's a place that--
[machine WHIRRING]
Huh?
Never mind.
MAN:
Hey, hey, hey!
[chattering lNDlSTlNCTLY]
Hi.
Welcome.
Well, I am certainly glad that you are gonna be staying in Jellystone for a while.
And what animal will you be observing?
Well, I thought I would observe the courting rituals of the American ranger.
I happen to hear the American ranger is a very charming intelligent, attractive species.
One that always keeps his cool.
Even when basket-stealing bears push his buttons?
Listen, Yogi will be Yogi.
And I'm just not gonna let it bother me anymore.
Besides I have more important things to focus on.
Oh....
[laughing]
I....
Let's-
- Let's try that again.
[HORN honking]
[gasping]
Afternoon, Mr. Ranger, sir!
Hi, Miss Movie Lady!
[BARKING]
Yogi!
I love this place.
smith:
Yogi!
Hey!
[English
- US
- SDH]
A ragtag bunch of rebels
Faces the greatest military superpower of the day.
It's a war they never should have won.
This is the secret history of how they did it.
Daring.
Leadership.
New ways of fighting...
And true American grit.
We are pioneers and trailblazers.
We fight for freedom
We transform our dreams into the truth,
Our struggles... will become a nation
- The Story of Us
- Revolution
New York City.
Gateway to North America.
Today the financial capital of the world.
8 million people.
In 1776, this is a city of just 20,000.
It will soon become the battleground
For the biggest land invasion in American history.
Three miles from Wall Street,
Where 23rd Street crosses Lexington Avenue today...
The Rebels dig in to defend New York
At Kips Bay.
Commander of the Rebel Army is General George Washington.
He has already driven the British out of Boston.
A surprise victory against superior forces.
But they'll be back.
The hour is fast approaching
On which the honor and success of this army,
And the safety of our bleeding country depends.
Joseph Plumb Martin
Enlisted in the Rebel forces at 15...
Inspired to fight under Washington's command.
A farm boy, he joins thousands of untrained volunteers.
Our Revolutionary Army was quite something.
It was-- in a nation that wasn't really a nation yet,
Just starting out,
And we took on the greatest superpower of the time.
Washington's ragtag troops
Are about to face the best-equipped
And most powerful fighting force in the world.
June 29th.
45 British warships mass off Staten Island.
Bearing down on New York City,
The ultimate war machine of its day,
The British ship-of-the-line.
Each ship is made from over 2,000 century-old trees.
Each carries hundreds more soldiers
To the fight against the colonies.
And each is armed with up to 64 heavy cannons...
Capable of hurling a 24-pound cannonball
At the speed of sound,
Delivering it to targets over a mile away.
One ship-of-the-line costs the equivalent
Of a modern aircraft carrier.
Another 350 British ships
Are racing across the Atlantic to join them.
The British want to terrify the Rebels into submission.
Instead, they inspire them to resist.
On July 2nd, there's a crisis meeting in Philadelphia.
50 delegates elected to the Continental Congress
From the 13 colonies hold an emergency session.
They include radicals like Ben Franklin,
Thomas Jefferson and John Adams.
What they're debating
Is nothing less than high treason--
Total independence from Britain.
The penalty is death.
We are in the midst of a revolution,
The most complete
In the history of the world.
It's the birth of American democracy.
We have to expect
A great expanse of blood to obtain it.
Some don't believe the Rebels stand a chance.
We are about to brave the storm
In a skiff made of paper.
But the doubters are outnumbered nearly five to one.
On July 4, 1776,
The delegates ratify a document
That will change the world,
The Declaration of Independence.
"We hold these truths to be self-evident,"
"That all men are created equal,"
"That they are endowed by their Creator"
"With certain unalienable Rights."
Now think about that.
They're saying that your rights come not from the king,
Not from the government, your rights come from God
And furthermore, they can't be taken away from you.
They're inalienable.
blacks, women, gays--
Everybody looks to the Declaration
As a way of saying we are Americans, too.
So the Declaration is the American creed.
" ... that among these are Life..."
"Liberty..."
"And the pursuit of Happiness."
You cannot help but be stirred
When you read those words.
And you feel the excitement of being
On the cusp of something so profound.
We can be free.
Now soldiers like Plumb Martin
Have something worth fighting for.
On July 12th, two British warships
Open fire on New York City.
It must have been quite a shock
Because New York, up to that point,
Was pretty quiet city.
It was a business city.
So you had significant support for the Rebels
But also significant support
For the people who were still loyal to the king.
A month later, Joseph Reed,
Secretary to George Washington,
Tracks the British fleet massing off New York.
Over 400 ships,
The largest British Naval task force until D-day.
32,000 British troops
Prepare to storm Manhattan Island.
They outnumber Patriot forces two to one.
Just five of the biggest British ships
Carry more firepower
Than all the Patriot guns in the city.
Reed is awed by the sight.
When I look down
And see the prodigious fleet they have collected,
I cannot help being astonished
That a people should come 3,000 miles
At such risk, trouble and expense
To rob, plunder and destroy another people
Because they will not lay their lives
And fortune at their feet.
It's the biggest attack on New York City
Until September 11, 2001.
But the Rebels will stand and fight.
The difference for me was that the British Army
Was fighting for a king
And the Americans were fighting for their lives.
Plumb Martin is one of 500 men
Standing guard at Kips Bay.
Have a look.
The first thing that saluted our eyes
Was all 4 ships at anchor
Within musket shot of us.
"The Phoenix."
I could read her name as distinctly as though
I was directly underneath her stern.
Pull out your gun!
The assault begins.
September 1776.
New York is under fire.
In one hour... 2,500 British cannonballs
Smash the Rebel defenses at Kips Bay.
4,000 British troops storm Manhattan.
Tough and battle-hardened,
A British redcoat has six times
More combat experience than a Patriot Army recruit.
Get back in your lines!
Washington watches his army collapse.
Hold the line, men!
They retreat along an ancient Native American path
That will later be known as Broadway.
September 20th.
New York, now in British hands, burns.
No one knows who starts the fire...
But over two days
It destroys 1/4 of the city.
It gives you a sense of the people
Who wanted to be free,
How much they were willing to endure.
The city being burned, the city being occupied.
Gives you a sense of how much they wanted freedom.
More than 3,000 Patriot POWs
Are thrown into prison ships in New York Harbor.
The most notorious is the HMS Jersey,
Nicknamed "Hell."
One prisoner, Robert Sheffield,
Escaped to tell the tale.
The air was so foul that at times
A lamp could not be kept burning,
By reason of which the bodies were not missed
Until they had been dead ten days.
Nine in ten prisoners die.
There is a memorial over in Brooklyn
To those that died on British prison ships
In New York Harbor.
Thousands of Americans.
Over the course of the war, 12,000 Patriot POWs will die in the prison ships,
Three times more than are killed in battle.
The loss of New York is Washington's
First defeat as commander in chief.
The overwhelming British force crushes the Rebel Army.
Washington's only hope now
Rests hundreds of miles inland,
With men the British know nothing about.
A new type of soldier with new weapons...
And new rules of war.
Let's go kill us some redcoats.
By June, a new British Army of 8,000 men
Heads south from loyalist Canada.
Its objective:
Kill off the American Revolution once and for all.
They're led by General John Burgoyne.
An aristocrat, politician, and art lover,
He's also one of the best cavalry officers
In the British military.
Burgoyne pushes south,
Following the Hudson River.
His army is like a mobile city.
The redcoats are accompanied by 2,000 servants,
Wives and mistresses.
200 supply wagons
Carry 84 tons of powder and shot,
As well as silver and porcelain tableware
For the officers' meals.
Burgoyne's plan is simple.
He's traveling from St. John's in Canada 170 miles south to Saratoga,
Deep in the interior of the New York Colony.
Then, he'll link up with the victorious British Army
In New York City,
Cutting the colonies into two parts.
But the American frontier
Becomes the British Army's worst enemy.
The problem is they're in
What we might call
A counterinsurgency kind of campaign,
Where their passage through the land
And the offense that they give to farmers
Creates enemies wherever they go.
Now Washington unleashes revolutionary new tactics
And a totally new type of soldier.
Men who learned their skills on the frontier.
So this army came together--
An army of militia, an army of woodsmen,
An army of sharpshooters,
And we didn't play by the rules.
British redcoats are trained for open battlefields.
Now they face Rebel sharpshooters
Hidden in dense cover.
Leading them, Daniel Morgan.
Hard drinker, gambler, brawler.
And now the colonel of an elite corps of 500 riflemen.
He was a self-made man
And he was a-- although not educated at a great school--
Was a smart guy, was a tough guy,
And was ready and willing
To step up when the time called.
He was the perfect guy to show up at the perfect time.
Burgoyne's route takes him through dense forest
Over five times larger than all of England.
Trees once intended to build British ships...
Now become Rebel roadblocks.
The British are sitting ducks.
Their advance slows to just a mile a day.
The march south becomes a six-week nightmare.
The sharpshooters know the land...
And have technology on their side.
Morgan's men are armed with American long rifles.
They're lightweight,
With a slender barrel at least 40 inches long
And fire a 50-caliber shot a half-inch wide.
Based on a German hunting weapon,
The guns have a unique American innovation...
Grooves inside the barrel that spin the shot,
Stabilizing it, giving it deadly accuracy.
Armed with this rifle,
Patriot marksman can hit a target 250 yards away,
More than three times the average distance
Of a modern FBI sniper shot,
And twice the range of the British muskets.
The tide of the war is about to change.
Morgan's plan:
First take out Burgoyne's Native American scouts.
400 have allied themselves with the British
To preserve their ancestral lands.
But Morgan and his men now use
Traditional Native American tactics against them.
They attack using speed, stealth,
And surprise.
After months of guerrilla warfare,
All the scouts are dead
Or desert behind enemy lines.
Any knowledge the redcoats had of the terrain
Goes with them.
The Rebels are rewriting the rules of war, and they're about to do it again.
1777.
The American War of Independence
Is in its second year.
New York and many parts of the colonies
Are in British hands.
The Rebels have been driven into the wilderness.
But the fight back has begun.
Patriot sharpshooters target a British Army
Under General John Burgoyne.
They've already picked off Burgoyne's
Native American guides.
Now the two armies meet near Saratoga.
Here the Rebels break the rules of 18th-century warfare
And start targeting British officers.
Leave the foot soldiers leaderless.
Your officers tended to be your most educated guy.
They understood the communications line,
They understood exactly what the orders were.
They were the source of trying to get
Something done on a battle space.
In Britain's 53rd regiment,
All but one of its 11 officers are killed or wounded.
The tactic of assassinating officers
Appalls the British.
On the defensive, the British regroup under
General Simon Fraser.
He brings fresh spirit
To the beleaguered British Army.
Daniel Morgan,
Commander of the sharpshooters acts fast.
Shimmy on up that tree
And take out the redcoat on his high horse.
His best shooter is an illiterate frontiersman
From Ireland, Tim Murphy.
This shot will turn the tide of the war.
The first shot misses.
This left.
The second skims his horse.
Too high!
Reload!
Come on, take him out!
The third hits home.
You could argue
That whoever fired the bullet
That took out Simon Fraser
Did as much as any Founding Father
To establish American independence.
Without leadership, the British lose 1,000 men.
Twice as many as the Patriots.
On October 17, 1777,
General Burgoyne surrenders.
It's a turning point.
The victory persuades Britain's greatest rival,
France, to join the war on America's side.
Now the French Navy will force the British
To fight a war on two fronts,
Land and sea.
But first, Washington must face
His greatest challenge as leader.
He makes his winter camp in Pennsylvania
At a place called Valley Forge.
In freezing temperatures,
The Rebels build 900 huts in just 40 days.
Each houses a dozen men.
He has an army of 14,000 men
And no houses,
And the Continental Congress has failed to
Provide him with resources,
And by willpower, by courage,
By leadership, by cajoling,
He has to hold the army together
In the middle of a terrible winter.
Joseph Plumb Martin,
Veteran of The Battle of New York,
Is at Valley Forge.
It's a desolate place.
We are now in a truly forlorn condition.
No clothing, no provisions
And as disheartened as can be.
Our prospect is indeed dreary.
All right, soldier.
This is gonna hurt a bit, all right?
You just grit your teeth.
Surgeon Albigence Waldo
Watches Washington's army head toward crisis.
The army, which has been surprisingly healthy,
Now begins to grow sickly from the fatigues
They have suffered from this campaign.
If we don't keep this clean,
You're gonna be right back in here.
1/5 of the soldiers have no shoes.
With little clean water,
Dysentery spreads through the camp.
Within weeks, 2,000 men are sick
And they run out of meat.
Down to their last 25 barrels of flour,
The men survive on "Fire cake,"
A mixture of flour and water.
The Rebel Army is a melting pot.
As many as 60% of recruits are convicts,
Freed slaves and immigrants.
But Washington's leadership
Inspires unruly men to stay in line.
What he had was a confidence
That if you want freedom,
This is what it's gonna take.
It's gonna take sacrifice, it's gonna take blood.
It's gonna take cold winters at Valley Forge.
It's gonna take losses.
General Washington, he was a great general,
To be able to uplift his army during Valley Forge
During that winter and still be able to fight.
I wish I would have been there,
I wish I could have fought for him,
Because I damn sure would have.
But Washington's army soon faces an enemy
Far more lethal than the British.
Smallpox.
The revolution breaks out
During the worst smallpox epidemic in US history.
The deadly airborne virus
Spreads through the British prison ships.
Isolated from the disease for generations,
The American colonists have little resistance to it--
And there's no cure.
Victims break out in blisters and sores.
The virus spreads through the blood,
Invading healthy cells, which it kills,
Producing more of the virus in the process.
Four in ten victims die.
Once smallpox arrives at Valley Forge,
It spreads through the cramped huts like wildfire.
Washington survived smallpox as a child.
Now he decides to take a gamble...
With one of the most daring experiments
In US military history.
Surgeons have learned about inoculation
From African slaves.
They harvest pus from a smallpox victim and smear the live virus
Into cuts on the skin of a healthy patient.
The inoculation spreads the infection,
But at a slower rate.
A week after exposure, the victim's
White blood cells create antibodies.
These attack and kill the virus that causes smallpox
Before the disease can spread.
But it's a dangerous race against time.
To survive, the patient's immune system
Has to work faster than the virus,
Or it will run out of control.
One in 50 of those inoculated will die.
But Washington's gamble pays off.
New cases of smallpox
Fall from several thousand to just a few dozen.
But to win the war against the British,
Washington turns to an unlikely hero
Who will transform his ragtag militia?
Into a formidable fighting machine.
1778.
George Washington's Patriot Army survives a hard winter
And an outbreak of smallpox at Valley Forge.
Now Washington introduces a new recruit
Who will change the course of the war.
Baron von Steuben is an ex-Prussian Army officer,
An elite soldier
Whose career is said to have been ruined
By his homosexuality.
But Washington makes him
One of the most powerful men in his command.
Washington was a genius in taking people in
Who didn't seem like they could achieve great things,
But under him, they rose to the challenge,
They rose to the occasion.
And that's what great leaders do.
Von Steuben's task:
Reinvent the demoralized Patriot Army
So they can take on the British in a close fight.
Our arms are in horrible condition,
Covered with rust.
Our men are literally naked,
Some to the fullest extent of the word.
Von Steuben starts by drilling discipline
Into Washington's ragtag recruits.
The men are unlike any he has ever trained before.
The genius of this nation
Is not in the least to be compared with that of
The Prussians or Austrians or French.
You say to your soldier,
"Do this," and he does it.
But here, I am obliged to say,
"This is the reason why you ought to do that,"
And then he does it.
Von Steuben brings order,
Discipline and hygiene to Valley Forge.
He moves latrines away from living quarters,
Rebuilds the kitchens on the opposite side of the camp,
And organizes housing
According to regiments and companies.
His biggest contribution,
He writes a manual on military training,
With methods that are still in use today.
Faster!
Von Steuben's drills European battle tactics
Into an elite corps of 100 men.
Up, soldier!
Move!
Each will train 100 more.
He also teaches them a new and deadly weapon... the bayonet.
Bayonet fighting will prove pivotal
In the battles ahead.
Bayonets allow rifles to double as spears,
Making close hand-to-hand combat
Possible without reloading.
But it's not just new weapons and skills
Von Steuben gives the Patriots,
It's a new attitude.
You know, we can talk about weapons
And how certain weapons change the face of warfare,
Which is absolutely true,
But the greatest weapon that you can ever have
Is right up here.
Men like Plumb Martin leave Valley Forge
Highly skilled killers.
While they retrain,
Another secret war has been raging
In British-occupied New York.
Here, a network of spies has been busy
Passing information to the Rebels.
Their leader is George Washington himself.
A man who's come down to us in history
As someone who is incapable of telling a lie,
Succeeds as a commander in no small measure
Because of his capacity for deception.
A British general will later claim that Washington
Did not outfight his enemies, but out-spy them.
Now his French allies come under deadly threat,
And only his secret army of spies
Can save them from disaster.
In New York, an estimated 20% Of the population
Is still loyal to the British.
Food costs are up 800%.
One young woman in five is a prostitute.
To the British, New York merchant Robert Townsend
Is a loyalist.
A member of the loyalist militia,
He writes for the loyalist press.
But to Washington's spy network,
His code name is "Culper Jr.,"
A fact that was only discovered in 1939.
Culper's gang will change the course of the war.
By July 1781,
New York is buzzing with rumor.
A French fleet has been sighted off Rhode Island.
News leaks out that the British
Plan to send warships from New York
For a surprise attack.
Culper must get word to Washington
To somehow stop the British fleet.
The spies use invisible ink.
An advanced formula unknown to the British,
The ink is made from garlic acid.
It can only be revealed by brushing the paper
In liquid iron sulfate.
The next link in the chain is Austin Roe,
A tavern owner from Long Island.
His contact, Abraham Woodhull,
Picks up the message and buries it at a secret drop.
Another agent, Ann Smith Strong,
Then uses her laundry as a secret code.
It signals a sailor who picks up the message
And takes it to Washington.
Washington moves troops towards New York,
Threatening the city,
Forcing the British fleet to stay put in New York Harbor.
The French fleet sails out of danger.
It will play a critical role
In the next stage of the war.
Now, with a spy network and a modern army
Backed by French naval power,
Washington is ready for a final showdown.
Come on!
October 1781.
Six years into a war the British
Thought would last six months,
The American Revolution comes to a head
At Yorktown, Virginia.
In trenches around the fortified city,
Plumb Martin, now a sergeant,
Waits with 8,000 other Patriot soldiers
For the signal to attack.
Washington's army has reinvented itself...
With sharpshooters...
Left!
With training, discipline
And new weapons...
And with a spy network that has saved the French fleet,
Giving the Rebels dominance at sea.
What remains of the British Army
Is under siege in Yorktown.
Trapped in the city,
The redcoats wait for reinforcements,
But back in Britain, the war is unpopular
And costing far too much money.
This is a case of hanging on
In the face of the-- The British actions
Long enough to where the British literally
Would grow weary of this
And realize that it was endless.
This is Washington's chance to end the war
With one decisive blow.
He committed to this idea
Of being able to stand on your own.
See, America is a dream,
And the only way to go get that dream
Is to show up
And bring your very best to that moment
And not stop
Until you bring that dream into existence.
Plumb Martin will be
One of the first over the top.
Godspeed.
How are you doing, my friend?
Good, how are you?
I better check it out.
Behind Yorktown's defenses, 9,000 battle-hardened British troops are waiting.
They're protected by a series of outlying cannon forts
Called redoubts.
By October 14th, just two remain.
If they're captured and their guns turned on Yorktown,
The British will be forced to surrender.
How's it look up there?
It's time.
All the batteries in our line lay silent.
We lay anxiously waiting for the signal.
Patriots race 100 yards to the British lines
Under fire and a hail of hand grenades.
Come on!
Come on!
A force of 400 Break through
And storm the British fort.
Fighting in close combat with bayonets,
They beat the redcoats back.
Immediately after the fighting had ceased,
I went out to see what had become of my wounded friend.
He was dead.
34 of Martin's comrades lie dead or wounded...
But they've breached Yorktown's defenses.
Two days later, the British surrender
And begin negotiations for peace.
For the past six years,
Leadership... training,
Weapons and intelligence have been vital.
The Rebels have achieved the impossible.
The United States is the only country
To win independence from the British in war.
On April 30, 1789,
Washington is inaugurated
First president of the United States of America
Under the new constitution.
But liberty comes at a price.
Over 25,000 men have lost their lives in the battle for independence...
But a new nation is born.
We hold these truths to be self-evident,
That all men are created equal,
That they are endowed by their Creator
With certain unalienable Rights,
That among these are Life,
Liberty...
And the pursuit of Happiness.
( narrator ) We are a land of many nations.
We are New World explorers.
We are the huddled masses...
yearning to breathe freedom.
We will risk it all.
We have the courage to dream the impossible and make it the truth.
We stand our ground and charge headlong towards our destiny.
America:
The Story of Us 1x01 Rebels and Revolution Original Air Date on April 25, 2010
Shiploads of businessmen and true believers are crossing the Atlantic Ocean to create a new world.
May 1610.
120 years after Columbus, it's still a perilous journey.
One ship, The Deliverance, carries a cargo that will change America forever.
All hands over here.
Onboard is John Rolfe, a 24-year-old English farmer.
Ambitious, self-reliant, visionary.
A born entrepreneur.
What takes us six hours today by plane was then a voyage of more than two months.
Seven of the early adventurers out of every ten will be dead within a year.
( man ) Land ahoy !
But the risks are worth it.
North America is the ultimate land of opportunity.
A continent of vast untapped wealth.
Starting with the most valuable resource of all... land.
What will be home to more than 300 million people lies under a blanket of forest covering nearly half the land.
More than 50 billion trees.
Further west, 9 million square miles of vast American wilderness.
60 million bison roam the plains.
And underground, there are rumors of gems, silver... and the largest seams of gold in the world.
The settlers expect nothing less than El Dorado.
But what Rolfe finds at the English settlement of Jamestown... is hell on Earth.
More than 500 settlers made the journey before Rolfe.
Hello ?
Hello ?
Barely 60 remain.
It's called "The Starving Time."
( "George Percy" ) Having fed on horses and other animals, we ate boots, shoes, and any other leather we came across.
( man ) Somebody, help !
Three months before Rolfe arrives, a man is burned at the stake for killing his pregnant wife and planning to eat her.
The English arrive unprepared for this new world and unwilling to perform manual labor.
Instead of livestock, they've brought chemical tests for gold... that they never find.
And this is not their land.
They build Jamestown in the middle of a Native American empire.
60 starving settlers among 20,000 of the Powhatan Nation, armed with bows and arrows that are up to nine times faster to reload and fire than an English musket.
They're soon enemies.
Only one in ten of the original settlers is left.
John Rolfe didn't come to plunder and leave like the others.
He's got his own plan.
There's money in tobacco, and England is addicted.
He's arrived with a supply of South American tobacco seeds, but growing it is limited to the Spanish colonies.
The Spanish control the worldwide trade.
Selling tobacco seeds to foreigners is punishable by death.
But John Rolfe has got his hands on some.
No one knows how.
And in the warm, humid climate and fertile soil around the Chesapeake Bay, Rolfe's tobacco crop flourishes.
The first large harvest produced by these seeds is worth more than a million dollars in today's money.
The great strength of America is our people.
If you wanna know what is the defining strength of America, it is our people, our immigrant tradition, our bringing in cultures from all over the world.
I know what goes into making success.
And when somebody's really successful, it's rarely luck.
It's talent, it's brain power, it's lots of other things.
Rolfe marries the daughter of the king of the Powhatan Empire.
Her name becomes legend:
Pocahontas.
In England, Rolfe makes her a celebrity when her face is put on a portrait that sells all over London, advertising life in the New World.
Shakespeare mentions the colony.
England's rich invest money here.
All of London knows about this land of plenty.
Within two years, tobacco grows in every garden.
From a living hell,
Jamestown is America's first boomtown.
Two years later, nearly 1,000 more settlers arrive, including 19 from West Africa.
Slaves.
But some go on to own their own land in Virginia.
12 years after the founding of Jamestown,
Africans were playing a shaping role in the creation of the colonies.
That's pretty incredible.
30 years later, there are over 20,000 settlers in Virginia.
America is founded on tobacco.
For the next century and a half, it's the continent's largest export.
Ten years after Rolfe arrives in Jamestown, another group of English settlers lands in North America.
They come ashore on a deserted beach 450 miles up the coast from Jamestown and call the place Plymouth, after the English port they sailed from.
These are a different breed of settler, a group of religious dissidents with faith at the center of their lives.
They made the dangerous Atlantic crossing seeking religious freedom in the New World.
24-year-old apprentice printer Edward Winslow arrives with a group of religious sectarians on a boat called the Mayflower.
By April 1621, their settlement is taking shape.
The Mayflower returns to England.
The Pilgrims are on their own in an unknown land.
( "Edward Winslow" ) A great hope and inward zeal we had of laying some great foundation for the propagating and advancing the gospel of the kingdom of Christ in those remote parts of the world.
They're 19 families.
Goats, chickens, pigs and dogs.
They have spinning wheels, chairs, books, guns.
And no way home.
If you create this environment as a land of opportunity, then you're gonna attract those type of people who wanna take that risk, who have-- wanna take that gamble and who believe in a better life.
They were heading for the Hudson River, but they've landed 200 miles further north at the beginning of winter.
They have arrived in the middle of a mini ice age, temperatures 2° colder than today.
Winters are longer, growing seasons shorter.
The soil is poor.
Little grows.
Food supplies run low.
the first three months, more than half the Pilgrims die.
William Bradford is the governor of a community soon in desperate trouble.
( "William Bradford" ) It pleased God to visit us with death daily.
Disease was everywhere.
The living were scarcely able to bury the dead.
They died sometimes two or three a day.
Of 100 and odd persons, scarce 50 remained.
At times, only six are fit enough to continue building their shelters.
Susanna White's husband dies that first winter.
Edward Winslow's wife perishes a month after.
Within weeks, White and Winslow marry.
They'll have five children.
Today more than 10% of all Americans can trace their ancestry back to the Mayflower.
For a time,
Plymouth provides the sanctuary they sought.
( "Susanna" ) Edward !
Edward !
Edward, please go and look over there !
But like Jamestown, there were others here first.
April 1621.
The Pilgrims have been in the New World for five months.
Barely half survive the first winter.
But they're not the first Europeans to arrive on this coast.
Five years before,
European ships brought light-skinned people and plague.
Almost nine out of ten of the local people are wiped out.
The Pokanoket people don't need enemies.
They make peace with the Pilgrims.
They teach the English how to grow crops in sandy soil, using fish for fertilizer.
But they want something in return.
They have a common enemy-- a rival tribe.
And the English have powerful weapons.
The Pilgrims aren't soldiers.
But in the New World, they have to fight to survive.
On August 14, 1621,
Pilgrims and Pokanoket, shoulder to shoulder, will launch a surprise attack that will seal their future in this new land.
( "William Bradford" ) It was resolved to send 14 men, well-armed, and to fall upon them in the night.
The captain gave charge:
Let none pass out.
( screaming )
The rival tribe doesn't know what hit them.
Surrounded, they have no answer for English firepower.
Pokanoket and Pilgrims find common ground... and a chance to survive.
Two unlikely allies.
A partnership all too rare in North America.
( "Edward Winslow" ) We have found the Indians very faithful in their covenant of peace with us.
They are people without any religion or knowledge of any God, yet very trusty, quick of apprehension, ripe-witted... and just.
Their victory brings a period of peace to the colony.
Their friendship is celebrated in a feast.
In time, it will become known as Thanksgiving.
One of the main themes in the founding of America was a place to do business, a place to expand your horizons, a place to live a life of your own, practice your own religion.
Those are the basic themes that brought people to these shores to colonize.
It's the start of a period of prosperity that will transform North America.
From Jamestown and Plymouth, their descendants grow across the landscape.
As more and more people cross the Atlantic-- thousands, tens of thousands, people with different backgrounds, different reasons for being here...
America becomes the place for everybody from everywhere.
Rolling the dice, coming together to create 13 colonies.
From Jamestown, agriculture spreads across the South, dirt farms transform into sprawling plantations.
Irish, Germans, and Swedes push back the frontier.
The Dutch bring commerce to a small island at the mouth of the Hudson River.
In time, it will be named New York.
The colonists are 2 inches taller, and far healthier, than those they left behind in Europe.
The Puritans average eight children, and they are twice as likely to survive to adulthood.
They are 20% richer and pay only 1/4 of the taxes of those in England.
Many still think of themselves as British, but each generation grows further from its roots.
Nowhere more so than Boston.
May 9, 1768.
Seven generations after John Rolfe's first tobacco harvest, the British want a bigger piece of the action.
A British customs official springs a surprise raid on The Liberty, a ship belonging to John Hancock, one of the richest men in Boston.
But Hancock's crew has other ideas.
They're carrying 100 casks of imported wine and don't want to pay duty.
It's a radical act of rebellion against taxes imposed by a king 3,000 miles away.
To the British, they're just common smugglers.
This small skirmish changes everything.
The British seize Hancock's ship, triggering riots that sweep through Boston.
We didn't wanna pay taxes to a king and to a parliament where we didn't have a voice, and we didn't have any representation.
We have a natural resentment toward government, which was how we were born.
The king sends 4,000 redcoats to Boston to enforce his laws.
Boston was a city of commerce, culture, civilization, and revolution, unfolding right before the eyes of the colonists and the eyes of the British.
October 1768.
British soldiers clamp down on Boston, a port crucial to the British Empire... and a hub of global trade and commerce.
Its dockyards are some of the busiest in the world, producing 200 ships a year from America's vast timber reserves.
1/3 of all British shipping is built in the colonies.
Timber fuels the global economy... much like oil does today.
Across New England, marks identify the tallest, strongest trees selected by the crown for British ships.
England has lost most of its forests.
It wants American wood.
In Boston, there's one redcoat for every four citizens.
It's a city under occupation.
Paul Revere is a silversmith and one of Boston's prominent businessmen... an unlikely subversive.
( "Paul Revere" ) They formed and marched with insolent parade, drums beating, fifes playing, and colors flying, each soldier having received 16 rounds of powder and ball.
( man ) He is an upper-middle-class figure, someone who has risen through his own efforts, his own talent.
He represents what we have created on our own with very little help from our cousins across the Atlantic.
But when revolution comes to North America...
Revere will be at the center of it.
( narrator ) Boston and the 13 colonies are an economic powerhouse, critical to Britain.
Nearly 40% of everything exported from Britain makes its way to America.
The fishing fleet ships thousands of tons of salted cod to the Caribbean.
Returns with sugar and molasses... raw material for rum.
Taxed by the British after every exchange.
In Africa, rum is the currency used to purchase the most profitable cargo of all...
African slaves.
Between 1700 and 1800, more than 1/4 of a million Africans are brought to the American colonies.
More slaves than all those who came of their own free will.
Most wind up on large plantations in the South.
But they're also critical to the economy of the North.
10% of Boston's population is black.
Boston is a melting pot, and tension is building.
( woman ) Nobody likes invaders in their homes.
To have people here, foreigners on your soil, is something-- is a great incentive for people to fight.
( people shouting )
March 5, 1770:
After three days of unrest, an angry mob roams the streets.
Hundreds of men who lost their jobs and blame the British gather on King Street and face off against eight redcoats with orders not to fire.
What's about to happen will change America forever.
A 17-year-old wig maker's apprentice, Edward Garrick, lights the fuse.
This is how wars start.
( men shouting )
Come on, let's have it !
Private Hugh Montgomery is hit with a club.
( men shouting )
An African-American, Crispus Attucks, dies instantly.
( man ) Everybody, run !
When the smoke clears, four more are dead.
How Boston reacts will change the course of history.
Silversmith and political radical Paul Revere caures the moment British soldiers kill five colonists in the streets of Boston.
His engraving will fuel the fires of revolution as outrage spreads across the 13 colonies.
( man ) Unhappy Boston see thy sons deplore, thy hallowed walks besmeared with guiltless gore, whilst faithless Preston and his savage bands, with murderous rancor, stretch their bloody hands.
The most formidable army in the world firing on an unarmed crowd.
An explosive image with a title that says it all:
"The Bloody Massacre."
( man ) There was the old joke,
"You give me a picture, I'll give you a war."
Those who wanted to stir things up and to make a statement and maybe even lead a revolution, it made them able to rally others to their side.
News spreads fast.
The colonists are avid readers, a legacy from the first Bible-reading Puritans in Plymouth.
Boston has the first weekly newspaper.
There are now more than 40 papers across the colonies.
And the new postmaster general, Benjamin Franklin... has introduced a revolutionary postal-delivery system.
Night riders cut the delivery time in half.
The communications network connecting the colonies is one of the best in the world.
And the British have no idea.
They hope the news can be contained.
Before news reaches England, most of America knows about the Boston Massacre.
It's a very American spirit of an idea, this idea that everybody should have access to knowledge.
It's very much like that pioneering idea, everybody should be able to make their way in the world.
A printer in Connecticut can read the exact same story as a farmer in North Carolina.
December 1773.
"The Boston Gazette" breaks another story that will fan the flames of rebellion.
The rising tide of anger and resentment forces England's hand.
They repeal all taxes... except one, on tea.
It's not enough.
In one of the most famous acts of resistance in American history,
Rebels dump over $1 million worth of tea in Boston Harbor.
When someone comes along and smacks us, we don't turn the other cheek.
That's not who we are.
( man ) Move it !
The British respond by shutting down Boston Harbor... one of America's busiest, wealthiest ports.
Come on, lad.
Hundreds lose their jobs.
The British mean to strangle any resistance from the rebellious colony of Massachusetts.
America is about to change forever.
Tensions escalate far beyond Boston.
Settlers are pushing west.
Many have their eyes set on new land west of the Appalachians.
But to protect Native American lands,
England has banned settlements along a boundary called the Proclamation Line.
Hundreds are evicted from their homes on the frontier.
September 5, 1774.
( "John Adams" ) We want liberty...
Incensed at the British actions, 56 delegates from across the colonies gather at the First Continental Congress in Philadelphia.
It's the first step on the road to American democracy.
Among them are John Adams,
Patrick Henry, and a gentleman landowner from Virginia named George Washington.
( "George Washington" ) At a time when our lordly masters in Great Britain will be satisfied with nothing less than the deprivation of American freedom, it seems highly necessary that something should be done to maintain liberty.
Across New England, people prepare to defend themselves.
Smuggled arms are collected and stashed in secret hideaways.
But while many expect conflict, most delegates in Philadelphia want peace with Britain.
A military action would make a wound that would never be healed.
( man ) That's good, we don't have all day, let's go, come on.
The First Continental Congress resolves that a British attack on any one colony will be regarded as an attack on all of them.
What emerges at Philadelphia is solidarity.
( "Patrick Henry" ) The distinctions between Virginians, Pennsylvanians,
New Englanders, and New Yorkers are no more.
I'm not a Virginian.
I am an American.
The future of the 13 American colonies hangs in the balance.
Spring 1775.
Near Concord, Massachusetts.
Get in here, get those weapons stacked up.
We haven't got all day.
Local gunsmith Isaac Davis puts the town militia through basic training.
( man ) The American patriots knew that they were doing the right thing.
You're starting the birth of a nation.
You had to really believe in what you were doing.
( "Isaac Davis" ) You've gotta keep this clean here, sir.
If you keep that clean, it'll save your life.
If war comes, this will be America's first line of defense.
A volunteer home guard with weapons paid for by local citizens.
Gentlemen, it's looking good, it's looking good.
Let's have some breakfast and move out.
They're farmers, blacksmiths, and store owners.
A fighting force of ordinary Americans.
( man ) The militiamen of any of the colonies were made up of just its citizens.
It was a citizen-based protection unit.
And some of them had some skills, but some of them were just the carpenters.
Some of them were just the mason or the blacksmith.
I mean, these were e guys that-- they had something at stake to protect their colony.
So they started to form together, just trying to help protect each other.
Every town across the colonies has its own militia, but now they're preparing to defend themselves against the British Army.
( "Isaac Davis" ) Better than yesterday, better than yesterday.
For six generations across Massachusetts, men are expected to serve as militiamen.
In Massachusetts, 1/3 of all men between 16 and 50 are ready to bear arms at a minute's notice.
Excellent, good shot.
We keep this up, we're gonna give those redcoats a scare, all right ?
The British will not stand for any armed resistance.
April 19, 1775.
After midnight, 900 redcoats leave their barracks in Boston for Lexington and Concord, about 20 miles away.
Their orders:
Arrest the Rebel leaders and seize their weapons.
News of the British attack also reaches Paul Revere.
His midnight ride will alert local militias.
Revere rides ahead of the British troops.
His warning spreads from town to town, across the New England countryside.
Paul Revere reaches Lexington... in time to spread the word.
The British are coming.
We need to warn the militia.
Get 'em together.
Come on !
By 5:00 in the morning, 60 militiamen line up.
They're commanded by a farmer, John Parker.
They're faced off against hundreds of well-armed and highly experienced British soldiers.
What happens next will transform the world forever.
( narrator ) Sunrise, April 19, 1775.
On one side 60 men, poorly armed and barely trained.
On the other, hundreds of the most powerful army in the world.
Men who have only been active for a handful of months vs. an army that in the past 20 years has fought on five continents and defeated everything in its path.
For these Rebels, the fight is for nothing less than freedom itself.
These guys were revolutionaries, they were scallywags, they were rebels, some of them were gentlemen farmers, some of them were overeducated, some of them were undereducated.
It really was the birth of a nation.
The Lexington Militia gathers on the village common.
Dairy farmers and shopkeepers.
But also among them are free African-Americans and slaves.
It is a unique experience that African-Americans have had in the military in America.
African-Americans fought for the country even before it was a country.
African-Americans like Prince Estabrook.
Give me training.
You give me a weapon, and I can perform as well as you can.
Then there's no power on Earth that's gonna hold me down forever.
Stand your ground.
Don't fire unless fired upon.
But if we mean to have war, let it begin here.
Captain John Parker once fought on the side of the British.
( horse neighing ) 1/4 of the men standing at his side are related to him.
( gunshot firing )
No one knows who fires the first shot at Lexington... ( horse neighing ) but it's the shot heard 'round the world.
I mean, the redcoats, that's intimidating, the way they move, the way they march, the way they execute on that open space.
I imagine, on some level, for the guy who works the printing press, this is overwhelming beyond anything you could possibly articulate in words.
( man ) Fire !
( gunshots firing )
Prince Estabrook is hit in the first volley.
No army in the world can stand toe-to-toe with the British, let alone a ragtag militia.
( man ) Fire !
The British fired up to four times the rate of the militia.
( men shouting )
Within minutes of the first shots fired at Lexington, eight Patriots are dead, ten wounded.
The American Revolution has begun.
The redcoats reach Concord at 9:00 in the morning.
Acting on a tipoff from colonists loyal to the crown, they raid the militia's arms stash.
But the Rebels have got there first... hiding almost everything.
( man ) That's good, we don't have all day, let's go, come on.
They continue to search for weapons, giving the Patriots more time to spread the word.
The militia gathers just outside the town of Concord.
By late morning, more than 1,000 have arrived from the surrounding villages.
Their plan, to defend their towns against the British.
Let's go !
The British soldiers left their barracks 15 hours ago.
And now they face a 20-mile march back to Boston.
Shattered lives... an occupied city... blood in the streets of Boston... and now Lexington.
A people unified in the fight against tyranny.
Now the Patriots have their chance.
Gunsmith and militia leader Isaac Davis takes a bullet through the heart.
( gunshots firing )
The Patriots seize the upper hand and intend to make the British soldiers pay.
They shadow the redcoats' march, firing on them the entire way.
1/3 are killed or wounded.
Seven generations after the first settlers left England, in search of prosperity and freedom, their descendants will have to fight for these rights.
Standing in their way is the might of the world's greatest military superpower.
And they're not about to give up their colonies lightly.
A ragtag bunch of rebels faces the greatest military superpower of the day.
It's a war they never should have won.
This is the secret history of how they did it.
Daring.
Leadership.
New ways of fighting... and true American grit.
New York City.
Gateway to North America.
( siren blaring )
Today the financial capital of the world.
Population: 8 million people.
In 1776, this is a city of just 20,000.
( iron clanking )
It will soon become the battleground for the biggest land invasion in American history.
Three miles from Wall Street, where 23rd Street crosses Lexington Avenue today... the Rebels dig in to defend New York at Kips Bay.
Commander of the Rebel Army is General George Washington.
He has already driven the British out of Boston.
A surprise victory against superior forces.
But they'll be back.
( "George Washington" ) The hour is fast approaching and the safety of ourd bleeding country depend.
Joseph Plumb Martin enlisted in the Rebel forces at 15... inspired to fight under Washington's command.
A farm boy, he joins thousands of untrained volunteers.
Our Revolutionary Army was quite something.
It was-- in a nation that wasn't really a nation yet, just starting out, and we took on the greatest superpower of the time.
Washington's ragtag troops are about to face the best-equipped and most powerful fighting force in the world.
June 29th.
45 British warships mass off Staten Island.
Bearing down on New York City, the ultimate war machine of its day, the British ship-of-the-line.
Each ship is made from over 2,000 century-old trees.
Each carries hundreds more soldiers to the fight against the colonies.
And each is armed with up to 64 heavy cannons... ( man shouting ) ... capable of hurling a 24-pound cannonball at the speed of sound, delivering it to tgets over a mile away.
One ship-of-the-line costs the equivalent of a modern aircraft carrier.
Another 350 British ships are racing across the Atlantic to join them.
The British want to terrify the Rebels into submission.
Instead, they inspire them to resist.
On July 2nd, there's a crisis meeting in Philadelphia.
50 delegates elected to the Continental Congress from the 13 colonies hold an emergency session.
They include radicals like Ben Franklin,
Thomas Jefferson and John Adams.
What they're debating is nothing less than high treason-- total independence from Britain.
The penalty is death.
We are in the midst of a revolution, the most complete in the history of the world.
It's the birth of American democracy.
We have to expect a great expanse of blood to obtain it.
Some don't believe the Rebels stand a chance.
We are about to brave the storm in a skiff made of paper.
( thundering )
But the doubters are outnumbered nearly five to one.
On July 4, 1776, the delegates ratify a document that will change the world, the Declaration of Independence.
"We hold these truths to be self-evident,
"that all men are created equal,
"that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights."
( man ) Now think about that.
They're saying that your rights come not from the king, not from the government, your rights come from God and furthermore, they can't be taken away from you.
They're inalienable.
( men cheering )
Every group:
blacks, women, gays-- everybody looks to the Declaration as a way of saying we are Americans, too.
So the Declaration is the American creed.
( "George Washington" ) " ... that among these are Life...
"Liberty... and the pursuit of Happiness."
( men cheering )
You cannot help but be stirred when you read those words.
And you feel the excitement of being on the cusp of something so profound.
( men cheering )
We can be free.
( men cheering )
Now soldiers like Plumb Martin have something worth fighting for.
On July 12th, two British warships open fire on New York City.
( screaming )
( Rudolph ) It must have been quite a shock because New York, up to that point, was pretty quiet city.
It was a business city.
So you had significant support for the Rebels but also significant support for the people who were still loyal to the king.
A month later, Joseph Reed, secretary to George Washington, tracks the British fleet massing off New York.
Over 400 ships, the largest British Naval task force until D-day.
32,000 British troops prepare to storm Manhattan Island.
They outnumber Patriot forces two to one.
Just five of the biggest British ships carry more firepower than all the Patriot guns in the city.
Reed is awed by the sight.
( "Joseph Reed" ) When I look down and see the prodigious fleet they have collected,
I cannot help being astonished that a people should come 3,000 miles at such risk, trouble and expense to rob, plunder and destroy another people because they will not lay their lives and fortune at their feet.
It's the biggest attack on New York City until September 11, 2001.
But the Rebels will stand and fight.
The difference for me was that the British Army was fighting for a king and the Americans were fighting for their lives.
Plumb Martin is one of 500 men standing guard at Kips Bay.
( man ) Have a look.
( "Plumb Martin" ) The first thing that saluted our eyes was all four ships at anchor within musket shot of us.
"The Phoenix."
I could read her name as distinctly as though
I was directly underneath her stern.
( man ) Pull out your gun !
( men shouting )
The assault begins.
( narrator ) September 1776.
( man shouting )
New York is under fire.
( shouting )
In one hour... 2,500 British cannonballs smash the Rebel defenses at Kips Bay.
4,000 British troops storm Manhattan.
Tough and battle-hardened, a British redcoat has six times more combat experience than a Patriot Army recruit.
( "George Washington" ) Get back in your lines !
Washington watches his army collapse.
( horse neighing )
Hold the line, men !
They retreat along an ancient Native American path that will later be known as Broadway.
September 20th.
New York, now in British hands, burns.
No one knows who starts the fire... but over two days it destroys 1/4 of the city.
It gives you a sense of the people who wanted to be free, how much they were willing to endure.
The city being burned, the city being occupied.
Gives you a sense of how much they wanted freedom.
More than 3,000 Patriot POWs are thrown into prison ships in New York Harbor.
The most notorious is the HMS Jersey, nicknamed "Hell."
One prisoner, Robert Sheffield, escaped to tell the tale.
( "Robert Sheffield" ) The air was so foul that at times a lamp could not be kept burning, by reason of which the bodies were not missed until they had been dead ten days.
Nine in ten prisoners die.
There is a memorial over in Brooklyn to those that died on British prison ships in New York Harbor.
Thousands of Americans.
Over the course of the war, 12,000 Patriot POWs will die in the prison ships, three times more than are killed in battle.
The loss of New York is Washington's first defeat as commander in chief.
The overwhelming British force crushes the Rebel Army.
Washington's only hope now rests hundreds of miles inland, with men the British know nothing about.
A new type of soldier with new weapons... and new rules of war.
Let's go kill us some redcoats.
By June, a new British Army of 8,000 men heads south from loyalist Canada.
Its objective:
Kill offhe American Revolution once and for all.
They're led by General John Burgoyne.
An aristocrat, politician, and art lover, he's also one of the best cavalry officers in the British military.
Burgoyne pushes south, following the Hudson River.
His army is like a mobile city.
The redcoats are accompanied by 2,000 servants, wives, and mistresses.
200 supply wagons carry 84 tons of powder and shot, as well as silver and porcelain tableware for the officers' meals.
Burgoyne's plan is simple.
He's traveling from St. John's in Canada 170 miles south to Saratoga, deep in the interior of the New York Colony.
Then, he'll link up with the victorious British Army in New York City, cutting the colonies into two parts.
But the American frontier becomes the British Army's worst enemy.
The problem is they're in what we might call a counterinsurgency kind of campaign, where their passage through the land and the offense that they give to farmers creates enemies wherever they go.
Now Washington unleashes revolutionary new tactics and a totally new type of soldier.
Men who learned their skills on the frontier.
So this army came together-- an army of militia, an army of woodsmen, an army of sharpshooters, and we didn't play by the rules.
British redcoats are trained for open battlefields.
Now they face Rebel sharpshooters hidden in dense cover.
Leading them, Daniel Morgan.
Hard drinker, gambler, brawler.
And now the colonel of an elite corps of 500 riflemen.
( Richard M. ) He was a self-made man and he was a-- although not educated at a great school-- was a smart guy, was a tough guy, and was ready and willing to step up when the time called.
He was the perfect guy to show up at the perfect time.
Burgoyne's route takes him through dense forest over five times larger than all of England.
Trees once intended to build British ships... now become Rebel roadblocks.
The itish are sitting ducks.
Their advance slows to just a mile a day.
The march south becomes a six-week nightmare.
The sharpshooters know the land... and have technology on their side.
Morgan's men are armed with American long rifles.
They're lightweight, with a slender barrel at least 40 inches long and fire a 50-caliber shot a half-inch wide.
Based on a German hunting weapon, the guns have a unique American innovation... grooves inside the barrel that spin the shot, stabilizing it, giving it deadly accuracy.
Armed with this rifle,
Patriot marksman can hit a target 250 yards away, more than three times the average distance of a modern FBI sniper shot, and twice the range of the British muskets.
The tide of the war is about to change.
( screaming )
Morgan's plan:
First take out Burgoyne's Native American scouts.
400 have allied themselves with the British to preserve their ancestral lands.
But Morgan and his men now use traditional Native American tactics against them.
They attack using speed, stealth, and surprise.
After months of guerrilla warfare, all the scouts are dead or desert behind enemy lines.
Any knowledge the redcoats had of the terrain goes with them.
The Rebels are rewriting the rules of war, and they're about to do it again.
( narrator ) 1777.
The American War of Independence is in its second year.
New York and many parts of the colonies are in British hands.
The Rebels have been driven into the wilderness.
( horse neighing )
But the fight back has begun.
Patriot sharpshooters target a British Army under General John Burgoyne.
They've already picked off Burgoyne's
Native American guides.
( screaming )
Now the two armies meet near Saratoga.
Here the Rebels break the rules of 18th-century warfare and start targeting British officers.
The plan:
Leave the foot soldiers leaderless.
Your officers tended to be your most educated guy.
They understood the communications line, they understood exactly what the orders were.
They were the source of trying to get something done on a battle space.
In Britain's 53rd regiment, all but one of its 11 officers are killed or wounded.
( horse neighing )
The tactic of assassinating officers appalls the British.
On the defensive, the British regroup under
General Simon Fraser.
He brings fresh spirit to the beleaguered British Army.
Daniel Morgan, commander of the sharpshooters, acts fast.
Shimmy on up that tree and take out the redcoat on his high horse.
His best shooter is an illiterate frontiersman from Ireland, Tim Murphy.
This shot will turn the tide of the war.
The first shot misses.
This left.
The second skims his horse.
Too high !
Reload !
Come on, take him out !
The third hits home.
( Richard S. ) You could argue that whoever fired the bullet that took out Simon Fraser did as much as any Founding Father to establish American independence.
Without leadership, the British lose 1,000 men.
Twice as many as the Patriots.
On October 17, 1777,
General Burgoyne surrenders.
It's a turning point.
The victory persuades Britain's greatest rival,
France, to join the war on America's side.
Now the French Navy will force the British to fight a war on two fronts, land and sea.
But first, Washington must face his greatest challenge as leader.
He makes his winter camp in Pennsylvania at a place called Valley Forge.
In freezing temperatures, the Rebels build 900 huts in just 40 days.
Each houses a dozen men.
( Newt ) He has an army of 14,000 men and no houses, and the Continental Congress has failed to provide him with resources, and by willpower, by courage, by leadership, by cajoling, he has to hold the army together
in the middle of a terrible winter.
Joseph Plumb Martin, veteran of The Battle of New York, is at Valley Forge.
It's a desolate place.
( "Plumb Martin" ) We are now in a truly forlorn condition.
No clothing, no provisions and as disheartened as can be.
Our prospect is indeed dreary.
( man ) All right, soldier.
This is gonna hurt a bit, all right ?
You just grit your teeth.
Surgeon Albigence Waldo watches Washington's army head toward crisis.
( "Albigence Waldo" ) The army, which has been surprisingly healthy, now begins to grow sickly from the fatigues they have suffered from this campaign.
If we don't keep this clean, you're gonna be right back in here.
1/5 of the soldiers have no shoes.
With little clean water, dysentery spreads through the camp.
Within weeks, 2,000 men are sick and they run out of meat.
Down to their last 25 barrels of flour, the men survive on "fire cake,"
a mixture of flour and water.
The Rebel Army is a melting pot.
As many as 60% of recruits are convicts, freed slaves and immigrants.
But Washington's leadership inspires unruly men to stay in line.
( Colin ) What he had was a confidence that if you want freedom, this is what it's gonna take.
It's gonna take sacrifice, it's gonna take blood.
It's gonna take cold winters at Valley Forge.
It's gonna take losses.
( William Bodette ) General Washington, he was a great general, to be able to uplift his army during Valley Forge during that winter and still be able to fight.
I wish I would have been there,
I wish I could have fought for him, because I damn sure would have.
But Washington's army soon faces an enemy far more lethal than the British.
Smallpox.
The revolution breaks out during the worst smallpox epidemic in US history.
The deadly airborne virus spreads through the British prison ships.
Isolated from the disease for generations, the American colonists have little resistance to it-- and there's no cure.
Victims break out in blisters and sores.
The virus spreads through the blood, invading healthy cells, which it kills, producing more of the virus in the process.
Four in ten victims die.
Once smallpox arrives at Valley Forge, it spreads through the cramped huts like wildfire.
Washington survived smallpox as a child.
Now he decides to take a gamble... with one of the most daring experiments in US military history.
Surgeons have learned about inoculation from African slaves.
They harvest pus from a smallpox victim and smear the live virus into cuts on the skin of a healthy patient.
The inoculation spreads the infection, but at a slower rate.
A week after exposure, the victim's white blood cells create antibodies.
These attack and kill the virus that causes smallpox before the disease can spread.
But it's a dangerous race against time.
To survive, the patient's immune system has to work faster than the virus, or it will run out of control.
One in 50 of those inoculated will die.
But Washington's gamble pays off.
New cases of smallpox fall from several thousand to just a few dozen.
( screaming )
But to win the war against the British,
Washington turns to an unlikely hero who will transform his ragtag militia into a formidable fighting machine.
( narrator ) 1778.
George Washington's Patriot Army survives a hard winter and an outbreak of smallpox at Valley Forge.
Now Washington introduces a new recruit who will change the course of the war.
Baron von Steuben is an ex-Prussian Army officer, an elite soldier whose career is said to have been ruined by his homosexuality.
But Washington makes him one of the most powerful men in his command.
Washington was a genius in taking people in who didn't seem like they could achieve great things, but under him, they rose to the challenge, they rose to the occasion.
And that's what great leaders do.
Von Steuben's task:
Reinvent the demoralized Patriot Army so they can take on the British in a close fight.
( "Baron von Steuben" ) Our arms are in horrible condition, covered with rust.
Our men are literally naked, some to the fullest extent of the word.
Von Steuben starts by drilling discipline into Washington's ragtag recruits.
The men are unlike any he has ever trained before.
( "Baron von Steuben" ) The genius of this nation is not in the least to be compared with that of the Prussians or Austrians or French.
You say to your soldier,
"Do this," and he does it.
But here, I am obliged to say,
"This is the reason why you ought to do that,"
and then he does it.
Von Steuben brings order, discipline and hygiene to Valley Forge.
He moves latrines away from living quarters, rebuilds the kitchens on the opposite side of the camp, and organizes housing according to regiments and companies.
His biggest contribution, he writes a manual on military training, with methods that are still in use today.
( "Baron Von Steuben" ) Faster !
Von Steuben's drills European battle tactics into an elite corps of 100 men.
( "Baron von Steuben" ) Up, soldier !
Move !
Each will train 100 more.
He also teaches them a new and deadly weapon... the bayonet.
( screaming )
Bayonet fighting will prove pivotal in the battles ahead.
Bayonets allow rifles to double as spears, making close hand-to-hand combat possible without reloading.
But it's not just new weapons and skills
Von Steuben gives the Patriots, it's a new attitude.
( William Bodette ) You know, we can talk about weapons and how certain weapons change the face of warfare, which is absolutely true, but the greatest weapon that you can ever have is right up here.
Men like Plumb Martin leave Valley Forge highly skilled killers.
While they retrain, another secret war has been raging in British-occupied New York.
Here, a network of spies has been busy passing information to the Rebels.
Their leader is George Washington himself.
( Richard S. ) A man who's come down to us in history as someone who is incapable of telling a lie, succeeds as a commander in no small measure because of his capacity for deception.
A British general will later claim that Washington did not outfight his enemies, but out-spy them.
Now his French allies come under deadly threat, and only his secret army of spies can save them from disaster.
In New York, an estimated 20% of the population is still loyal to the British.
Food costs are up 800%.
One young woman in five is a prostitute.
To the British, New York merchant Robert Townsend is a loyalist.
A member of the loyalist militia, he writes for the loyalist press.
But to Washington's spy network, his code name is "Culper Jr.,"
a fact that was only discovered in 1939.
Culper's gang will change the course of the war.
By July 1781,
New York is buzzing with rumor.
A French fleet has been sighted off Rhode Island.
News leaks out that the British plan to send warships from New York for a surprise attack.
Culper must get word to Washington to somehow stop the British fleet.
The spies use invisible ink.
An advanced formula unknown to the British, the ink is made from gallic acid.
It can only be revealed by brushing the paper in liquid iron sulfate.
( shouting )
The next link in the chain is Austin Roe, a tavern owner from Long Island.
His contact, Abraham Woodhull, picks up the message and buries it at a secret drop.
Another agent, Ann Smith Strong, then uses her laundry as a secret code.
It signals a sailor who picks up the message and takes it to Washington.
Washington moves troops towards New York, threatening the city, forcing the British fleet to stay put in New York Harbor.
The French fleet sails out of danger.
It will play a critical role in the next stage of the war.
Now, with a spy network and a modern army backed by French naval power,
Washington is ready for a final showdown.
Come on !
( men shouting )
( narrator ) October 1781.
Six years into a war the British thought would last six months, the American Revolution comes to a head at Yorktown, Virginia.
In trenches around the fortified city,
Plumb Martin, now a sergeant, waits with 8,000 other Patriot soldiers for the signal to attack.
Washington's army has reinvented itself... with sharpshooters...
Left !
with training, discipline and new weapons... and with a spy network that has saved the French fleet, giving the Rebels dominance at sea.
What remains of the British Army is under siege in Yorktown.
Trapped in the city, the redcoats wait for reinforcements, but back in Britain, the war is unpopular and costing far too much money.
This is a case of hanging on in the face of the-- the British actions long enough to where the British literally would grow weary of this and realize that it was endless.
This is Washington's chance to end the war with one decisive blow.
( Richard M. ) He committed to this idea of being able to stand on your own.
See, America is a dream, and the only way to go get that dream is to show up and bring your very best to that moment and not stop until you bring that dream into existence.
Plumb Martin will be one of the first over the top.
Godspeed.
How are you doing, my friend ?
Good, how are you ?
I better check it out.
Behind Yorktown's defenses, 9,000 battle-hardened British troops are waiting.
They're protected by a series of outlying cannon forts called redoubts.
By October 14th, just two remain.
If they're captured and their guns turned on Yorktown, the British will be forced to surrender.
How's it look up there ?
It's time.
( "Plumb Martin" ) All the batteries in our line lay silent.
We lay anxiously waiting for the signal.
( men shouting )
Patriots race 100 yards to the British lines under fire and a hail of hand grenades.
Come on !
Come on !
A force of 400 break through and storm the British fort.
Fighting in close combat with bayonets, they beat the redcoats back.
( "Plumb Martin" ) Immediately after the fighting had ceased,
I went out to see what had become of my wounded friend.
He was dead.
34 of Martin's comrades lie dead or wounded... but they've breached Yorktown's defenses.
Two days later, the British surrender and begin negotiations for peace.
For the past six years, leadership... training, weapons and intelligence have been vital.
The Rebels have achieved the impossible.
The United States is the only country to win independence from the British in war.
On April 30, 1789,
Washington is inaugurated first president of the United States of America under the new constitution.
But liberty comes at a price.
Over 25,000 men have lost their lives in the battle for independence... but a new nation is born.
( "George Washington" ) We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life,
Liberty... and the pursuit of Happiness.

LET HIM LIVE WHILE HE LIVES FOR THE HOMELAND
We are full with a puppet.
With a plaything.
What shall we make with them?
Make onto them moustache?
And let us bind a sword onto their waist?
Or let us dress it in a suit in order for them to talk politics?
We look at it through a microscope though, what are they doing?
Or let us build up a theatre?
We gotta do something.
We gotta do something.
Let us deal with deep thoughts.
We examine it, why the chair stops on 3 feet, why does not stop on two.
Why we wipe our nose with our hand, why not our foot, than the flies.
Let us collect ants and we number them.
3, 4, 5
-What do you do?
- 6
-I'm listening.
-Are you listening?
-How dies under how much time, the others were destroyed soon.
-The others?
I destroy one on all weeks.
Sometimes two.
And?
Do you enjoy it?
Not, i'm listening.
-And do not fuck they?
-No.
-I am virgin and it is I am left over until the end of my life.
-You are murderous.

Then you.
We all of them we are related.
You are loyal.
I command it.
Surrender Prátye!
Said your mother, you will be good for a mercenary.
I said that you look at a lot more times down, but the truth upwards yes.
You see shades beneath here.
Pricked?
Not, only mosquito bite.
Sibling embrace.
Turkish habit.
Understand to this.
This learned trade of his, kills sometimes.
You too, if very much we have to.
Come, sit down!
-What's this?
-Ribbon.
Sign of my captivity
Take it off!
No.
Swore, I carry it while the king lives.
He lives.
He lives.
Look at this knife.
The man does not destroy it his mother, his father, his siblings.
Even then if it is commanded
This our relative.
Distant sibling.
But is real.
This famous knife.
Legendary.
It is said that who did it felled a tree with knife and then shaved with knife.
You tested it?
We are not shaving.
Prince, come here, we show something.
This is specific.
Cooked poisonous, rawly feeding.
If you eat some of him cooked, and then you eat rawly, then disinfects.
The antidote is the raw one.
And?
Prince, we came for you and not against you.
Got it?
I see.
-You brought this to the king?
-Yes.
-Poisoning?
-Sure.
hurray the king
hurray the king
hurray the king
They poison it!
I will be the new king.
Look, he knows it that poisoned
Says one like that," if goose, let him be fat then already". (*saying*)
You like him.
What may he believe?
Your elder brother says that you may fuck the kingdom.
Neither money, neither crown.
Why?
Because you are not Hungarian.
You did not take it to reason yet?
Sire!
No, not yet.
Fetch the head of that rotter.
You get 100 golds and 3 villages in exchange.
I'll get it.
To be or not to be?
You are big dick, Niculice.
Poor your mother, though distant relative.
Stop, this like this not good.
Jump!
Good, back up.
This already almost good.
Listen, you know what's going on here?
This not shaving.
Do not guffaw
Listen!
Now you take one of the heads and you are putting it in into the sack.
You take it away to the choker and you say it:
The cut-off head is in this sack.
Got it?
Konradin here!
-Konradin the choker?
-Yes.
She wanted to strangle.
Wanted to strangle?
Yes.
I strangle one on all weeks.
Yes, we know.
Everybody knows it, this my hobby.
And?
I will be the new king.
Sure, sure.
If you bring that red flower here for me.
What on kind of right you dictate to me?
On the right of the knife.
Want to kill?
No.
We execute a killer only.
Let the god be merciful to him if there is a god.
If he is not, then mercy.
Is he dead?
Yes.
Fortunately.
Where the majesty?
Majesty?
We elected it.
We did it.
I marry it.
You may not make it, morganatic.
This put, the memory of your slavery.
Hurray the king!
Let him live while he lives for the homeland
Why they are here?
This habit, majesty.
When you take a bath or eat, or shit, or fuck, the magnates are here then always.
Sends they.
I may not do it.
Magnates, go away from the personal hall.
Again I say it:
Go away.
Get out!
-Suiting the water?
-Perfect.
Tomorrow onto how many clocks let me prepare the bath?
Everyday I take a bath?
It would not do harm.
Prince!
Prince!
-Who are you?
-Your wife.
You?
I, you did not hear it yet?
Did my father not call it you yet?
And if I do not marry you?
But I want to marry you.
And it will be good if I am crowned, it with yours
Beautiful crown, i like that.
I bring it here, okay?
Don't touch!
Not into a child's hand truth.
How's that?
You are king!
Easy.
Sure, copy.
In original Vienna yes.
The lords pawned it.
Though beautiful piece.
Their whore mothers.
Come on help me.
The child comes.
Gentlemen i'm here, chose.
Did he cost much money?
Into drawn blood sure, everybody knows it
And Lackó my older brother's head.
And those shit ones his life, they were living persons.
Take out your purse because much money will run out here yet.
I do not want more blood.
You have to buy back the crown first.
Because I do not put that forgery on my head.
Though easy, wearable.
And...
And what you want to say yet?
You are a child yet.
You only says what you want.
I know.
He does not want to marry that little girl, the lord's daughter of castle.
Money, he wants money.
With money easy, with our money.
Our youthful king stupid yet.
He has to study yet.
He doesn't know what doe it mean to reign.
If muzzy, he has to help it.
If he may not be with something else, with a birch tree comma, a hazel-rod, a cane.
What did you say?
I said that we have to educate you.
Me, the king?
One more time:
Me, the king?
Now what?
From here we continue.
They will make use of everything against you, they love even, even hate.
And you have to take care of your life.
Before us the life.
I am married to a girl, I come to terms with the emperor.
Mihály my uncle my guardian will be and I will study.
You are a child yet.
You may not rule yet, I am your guardian.
You believe what I believe you too, that I speak it, you speak it you too, from which there is not a word between us, it does not exist.
Got it?
We understood it.
sure that understood.
Listen to me.
Sober life, not booze, watch your mouth, do not swear because the person who swears a lot lies a lot.
And a untruthful king...
Called in, Mr. lord?
Do you want to talk to me?
Take it easy.
Lujza, Lujza dog.
You believe it you caught a Turkish with this child?
I think it, that a snot, take a look that king playing, that bad blood is in him.
Who are they?
Akindzsik
Turks, how are you here?
Turks are everywhere
Selling you are, you learned this?
The devil lead the plain man on his back into the hell, who is laughing only .
They meet his bread fellow at the crossroad.
With you what's going on?
-the bread one asks it.
See, the devil leads into the hell.
And you laugh at this?
Why laugh at?
Imagine it what would be like if the devil would be sitting in my neck and I should carry into hell?
-It was destroyed!
-Who?
Your Mihály elder brother.
It was destroyed?
Who?
The Turkishs.
You smile?
You smile!
You want to hear something clever?
-From Solomon the Wise?
-Yes.
All of this is the time for all intent and under the sky.
It is time for war and a time for peace.
It is time for killing, and a time for healing.
It is time for breakdown and a time for build up.
Thanks.
And now end comes.
I noticed it is not better for the man than to take delight in his work.
Because this is his fate.
Want anything else?
You read what is about the friends, right?
Sure, only from them save the god.
Want to send?
How do you know?
You send for my horse.
You are afraid of me?
Not, but you are dangerous.
Though I made something for you, isn't it?
Yes, thank you.
But you know the old men's saying:
Only my friends protect the god.
My enemies defeating myself
I am not your friend, your guardian angel.
"Norok Sibun", my mother said goodbye to me so always.
Who are you?
It at who you fired.
Your guardian angel.
I will be like this then when you will be an old man when you roam the end of your life and I appear then.
Take a good look at me, that recognise, and do believe nobody then.
Because it was written that the first Hungarian man for the king is the sword of all patriots ready.
Let it find on his folk's happiness his joy, fortune wreathes his holy head.
Nice, but do not believe it
Do not believe them
THE SUN GOES DOWNWARDS
There is nothing on the world, that no would become disable the care.
Even you are not made of iron, the time digests you.
Do not forget yourself while you listen to others.
Live in such a way for your compa- nions that you should not die of it.
Poem.
Why, not liked?
He the king?
Do these not get to know each other?
I put this up over here!
This no real king, right?
No.
To see on him, that no.
In shit may be if he has doubles.
Who are you?
I do not know you.
We know each other.

I came to the king.
There he goes.
How many are from him?
How they got here?
Who are they?
I don't know, majesty.
They quit before you to kneel, this habit at you.
True, superb Páter?
Realised?
From odor too.
You too me, right?
How do you do?
And you?
I can see it more are from you.
How much?
Ask him it.
And his pals.
Is so everywhere supposedly.
Yes, from kings more are employed.
I see.
I brought a gift to you.
He does not resemble you.
Sure, from afar in a cloak.
I am the king now then.
What your advisers would say to this?
Do you blame everything on them?
Translated, they put the blame on me for everything.
What, they blame onto you?
Everywhere it is made with the big kings so, right?
I would be a big king?
No, no, then then if you die.
You know, this habit
We tear his tongue out as we got accustomed to it.
The Turkish was putting in his foot?
Come on!
Charlemagne did it so and Constantinus.
And you too!
And your beloved folk does not speak a word, right?
Nobody is let in front of me, even the old pals.
I brought somebody for you from the old times.
The singing captain.
The singing monk.
You know that old melody?
Turkish velvet my hood,
I live it now my life of pearl.
Dead Ádám my name, if you are a valiant come with me.
Come here dustbin, I kick you out from here, that your foot is not worth the land.
Superb Kinizsi lord.
The king's most loyal servant, his successor, heir and who knows it yet everything.
You remember this, right?
Do you get to know it?
We talk this over then.
Better the poor but wise youngster, than the old but foolish king, who does not have so much reason how accepts the sign.
Study steer, an ox will be from you. (*saying*)
Do not be too just...
go away, go away away.
Do not look too wise, why you would torment yourself, there is not a true man like that on the world who would make good one only and would never err.
Sure, is concerned about them.
He was all of his life for them.
It would be necessary to note this.
Sure, because this is my profession.
Beautiful profession.
What is a curve will not be straight.
It is not possible to count what there is not.
What's the problem?
Borbála said it, I will not be a king.
The Daddy promised it though.
Because we are bastardy children.
Bastardy children?
You know what present it is?
It that your mum was not the king's wife.
Was not neither count, neither baron, neither Gypsy primate...
You order?
How much do you get for him?
-If I would tell it, would kill.
You know what you have to say, right?
If you say something else I cut out your tongue.
Oh my God, oh my God, flood the river

You accept his legality as János, the king's son and you further his weal.
I swear.
You regret this yet.
Dead.

You cut yourself!
Knife, fork, scissors into a child's hand dangerous!
Sára, give the glove to me!
We are not ridiculous?
These destroy each other!
Not, they get drunk only!
What do everything in their boredom the people.
They learn from boredom.
They are praying from boredom
They love, get married, fucked from boredom.
And they die of the boredom finally.
What kind of dresses are these?
Cloaks to a duel.

Hungarian and Polish two good friends, fights together and drinks his wine.
-Abstains from a mushroom since his childhood, has a horror of him.
-Has a horror of him?
-Yes.
-Abstains from a mushroom, dilute shit from him.
I like it.
It is over already for the beautiful times,
I do not make court to the women already, to steal a kiss and to smash hearts,
The wild flowers bloom,
The girls get married,
Is not left for me one neither,
Who my orphan heart would love.
What you do here?
You are playing king?
Throw out these shits or I bite off their head.
What's this?
Old habit.
A spade, a hoe separate them from each other already.
Burned.
Yeah, yeah.
A solution was not other, you may see it.
It is necessary to get rid of a man like this.
Fuck you!
Lend an ear to the preacher's word!
One of the generations come, the other one is going, but the Earth remains forever.
The Sun gets up, the Sun sets, hurries onto his place and gets up again there.
The wind towards noon wind blows, turns north, goes around, is reversed and recurs.
The wind repeats his district so.
All rivers flow into the sea, and the sea does not fill up after all.
The rivers continue on their way their aim towards it.
Everything tyres
Everybody may not say that his eye saw everything or his ear heard everything
It will be what he was again, and what happened occurs again.
Nothing is new under the Sun.
If it is said onto something:
This is new.
Those times had it which one they were before us.
Not your dagger the people with the old ones.
But those who there will be later yet do not think of the later ones.
I saw everything what happens under the Sun, and I realised it that on all of them only futility and wind chase.
Tell this Polish to hurry to go away because the Turkish follows them.
Cowardly rabbit does not have a homeland
For a folk.
For a cowardly folk.
But it not trouble if you keep your head on your neck until a little time.
I already circumcised myself.
Escape in a frock, the Turkish does not hurt the priests.
Yes, it eats his shit the man for the survival.
If have got to.
That let a poet's mouth be so ugly.
I'm going, with a whistle, a drum, a cane violin.
Not tinkle!
The Turkishs hear it.
There's nobody here, only horses.
What kind of horses?
They.
They not horses, but camels.
Not camels, horses.
You?
I protect the camels, I bought it from the Turkish.
What?
I bought from Turkish
Take it off red ones,does not like the Turkish.
I am afraid of nobody, even the devil.
You are not afraid, only take to get frightened.
Sit down!
-There is an anthill here.
No, only mosquito.
Sit down!
-Sit down!
-All right!
I'll be right back.
Where you take it?
I don't know yet.
A Hungarian king may be from him yet.
You carry this?
Open it!
This copy, right?
Let the god be with you
Let's go!
A king will never be from him.
You eavesdropped?
Not, I lip-read only.
A king will never be from this.
Only if he licks out Turkish's ass.
Look!
Hungarian king and his pair.
They live?
Yeah, but not for long.
-Suicides?
-Yes
With your mushroom?
You this how do you know?
The man hears this-it.
Shit will be big if they were suicides.
-What there is in your hand?
-Nothing.
Show me!
Open it!
You pulled down the rings?
Slid off!
-You pulled down the rings?
Would have sticked to his finger.
You are a body snatcher.
Why you lurk, why you do not go round it?
Like this shorter.
Maybe that I am a loon, nowadays everybody yeah.
You hid into a frock for example.
You fear for your skin.
The calling to account.
You shit yourself.
The dresses suit you so, than on the elephant the lace.
You know why I said the elephant?
Not, but does not interest.
I have an elephant poem.
Shall I relate it?
No.
Nice animal the elephant, he did not regret you if you do not hurt it.
Shun, do not step it on, he a god's animal.
Stop your mouth up, you body snatcher, loon.
Take off the rings.
I do not take it off.
It will be good for the Turkish.
False.
So what?
Come.
The rascals went away.
Little house depends on the coast of Danube, what kind of nice this flat for me,
My two eyes float in a tear, if I remember him some times.
My two eyes float in a tear, if I remember him some times.
Previously on The Tudors...
Allow me to introduce my wife, Queen Katherine.
It seems incredible to have obtained such a perfect jewel of womanhood who bears towards me such perfect love.
I urge Your Majesty to be careful.
What, Lady Rochford?
Don't you think I know how to meddle with a man?
You hate my brother.
If only you could be more like him, Sir Thomas.
My husband always takes what he wants.
It's him.
It is him, isn't it?
Mr. Francis Dereham.
Surely you can understand why I cannot offer you anything.
- But you employed Joan Bulmer.
- I can't!
Oh, but you can.
Your Majesty.
Her name is Katherine Howard, and I've known her a long time.
We used to be very close.
Very close.
Today I appointed a new usher to my chambers.
You don't mind?
Of course not.
I told you, you must do as you will.
Madam, your good health.
I must see him.
Who, Your Majesty?
- Culpepper.
- My lady.
Tell him to come when the King is asleep.
This Dereham, you have to get rid of him.
I will, I promise.
I told you, I love you.
You must not be so familiar with the Queen of England.
The King ought to know how beggardely his wife's servants treat her.
Damn you Fell!
Damn you!
His Majesty wishes to thank God for blessing him with so perfect a companion as Queen Katherine.
I render thanks to Thee, oh Lord-
Thou hast been pleased to give me a wife as her I now have.
What does this letter say?
I thought Your Majesty just read-
I asked you to tell me what this letter says, my Lord Hertford.
The letter accuses Queen Katherine of dissolute living before she was married to Your Majesty, while she was living with the Dowager Duchess of Norfolk.
There was two men.
A music teacher named Henry Manox, and a gentleman called Francis Dereham.
And that her way of life was not a secret, that many knew of it.
Who wrote the letter?
It is not signed.
Whoever left the letter says he only wrote it because he did not have the heart to tell you by mouth.
It's a forgery!
Yes, Your Majesty.
The accusations in this letter are maliciously intended.
Many calumnies are published about well-known persons, are they not?
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- Nevertheless, my Lord,
I charge you to investigate the matter thoroughly.
Do not desist until you have reached to the bottom of the pot.
- Majesty.
- In the meantime, the Queen shall be confined to her apartments, with only Lady Rochford in attendance- until her name is cleared.
My Lord.
Majesty.
Your Majesty.
No, the other hand.
What?
Sergeant?
What is this?
My Lady, you are confined to your apartments, with only Lady Rochford to attend you, for as long as it please the King.
- No!
- Please, Katherine!
- Joan!
- Don't let them take me!
Joan!
Joan!
Why?
Why must I stay here?
Please tell me.
I don't understand.
Forgive me, my Lady.
But from now on there will be a guard posted just beyond the door.
Please.
Francis Dereham, you are under arrest.
Under arrest for what?
For what, I ask you?
I want to ask you some questions about what went on, some years ago, at Lambeth, between Katherine Howard, as she then was, and two men:
Henry Manox and Francis Dereham.
You know what I'm talking about, don't you?
There's no need to be afraid, Mistress Bulmer.
No harm will come to you- so long as you tell me the truth!
Is that clear?
Yes, sir.
I understand that this man,
Henry Manox, was a music teacher?
Did you ever see him or hear of him taking liberties with Katherine Howard?
Yes, sir.
He told me he was in love with her.
I told him,
I said if my lady of Norfolk knew of the love between him and Mistress Howard, she would undo him, because she is from a noble house, and if you marry her, some of her blood will kill you.
And what did Manox say?
He said, "Hold your peace, woman!
My designs are
"of a dishonest kind.
I doubt not I shall achieve my purpose."
She said to him that he would have her maidenhead, though it be painful to her, knowing he'd be good to her afterwards.
And did he-have her maidenhead?
No, sir, for she started seeing someone else.
And would that man be Francis Dereham?
Yes, my Lord.
Did you know Katherine Howard at Lambeth, when she was 14 or 15 years old?
Yes, sir.
Did you have carnal knowledge of her?
We-played some games.
We pretended to be man and wife.
It amused her.
Did you know her carnally?
You should know, Mr. Dereham, that we have spoken to some of the maids who used to sleep in the same dormitory.
They say that you crept into the Queen's bed for a hundred nights or more.
She was not the Queen.
Let me ask again.
Did you have carnal knowledge of Katherine Howard?
No!
I thought you were not altogether honest with me, Mr. Dereham.
I wanted to show you what we do to people who are dishonest.
Who don't tell the truth.
I'll tell you the truth.
Certain accusations have been made against the Queen.
What kind of accusations?
Oh, that she was light, immoral, dissolute...
With certain men...
Before she came to court.
I can't believe it to be true.
But since the accusations are made,
I must know all the facts.
But since this inquisition is in progress, be careful who you speak to.
I'll have no spark of scandal against her name.
Yes, Your Majesty.
I have a good hand.
What do they know?
Why have I been confined like this?
I don't know.
Someone has told them something!
Who?
What has he told them?
What has he told them?
Why are you crying like this?
It's not about you!
I have to speak to him.
I have to speak to the King.
He'll understand.
We have some evidence that Katherine Howard gave you a gold chain and rich cap, as a gift.
Why did she buy you such gifts?
Because she loved me.
Loved you?
Yes, my Lord.
She told me: "I promise you
"I do love you with all my heart."
She promised by her faith and troth that she would take no other husband but me.
You were pre-contracted then?
Yes, sir.
It was understood between us that we would get married.
That's why...
That's why you knew her carnally?
Yes, sir.
We didn't think we were doing anything wrong.
She was going to be my wife and I her husband.
We'd made promises before God.
Why did you not marry her, then?
I left Lambeth for a while and went to Ireland.
When I returned, Katherine was already at court.
The Queen recently took you back into her employment.
On what grounds?
The Dowager Duchess was kind enough to speak highly of my talents.
You have admitted to the fact that you had carnal knowledge of the Queen before her marriage to the King.
But did you also know her carnally afterwards?
No, sir!
No!
On my honour!
On your honour, Mr. Dereham?
My Lady?
His Excellency is here.
Eustace!
Please, sit.
Thank you, Lady Mary.
You are too gracious.
I had to see you.
There are many rumours at court.
And it seems the Queen has been confined to her apartments.
Why?
Nobody knows.
But the rumours speak of her misconduct.
I knew it.
I knew she was always a light young woman, dedicated only to pleasure.
And the sad fact is, Lady Mary, that the Howards are a great Catholic family.
No, Eustace, the sad fact is that Katherine Howard was never a good Catholic, nor ever a good wife.
Nor even less a Queen!
What have you discovered?
Katherine Howard was a loose young woman.
You surely knew that!
I was told that her upbringing had been unconventional.
I didn't know how unconventional.
I didn't suspect that at fourteen years old she was sleeping with two older men!
You met her!
You saw the look in her eyes.
She was never innocent.
And who is innocent, my sweetheart?
What did Dereham confess?
Only that he'd slept with the Queen before she was married.
Do you believe him?
I don't know.
I may ask again.
Husband, you must be careful.
If you remember, you were among those who offered Katherine Howard up to the King.
Do you suppose I ever forget that?
But that's why I must be harder on her than anyone else.
Since I was the most deceived.
I must to bed.
I have things to do in the morning.
I bid thee, all three of thee, good night.
Good night, brother.
So...
What shall we call your child, Thomas?
Sir Edward- can you not tell me what's happening?
I beg you.
No one tells me anything.
Please... please...
- Madam, I am forbidden to talk to you.
No, no.
You must speak to me.
Madam, I can't...
On my life!
Just something!
Why am I confined here?
What has anyone said?
They have taken Dereham to the Tower.
Also some of the maids who attended the Dowager Duchess.
Oh... my God.
That's all I know.
Now, Madam, you will have to excuse me.
I can say no more.
His Majesty the King.
Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.
Your Grace?
Your Majesty, my Lord Hertford, and other Councillors, have made diligent inquiries into the question of the misconduct of the Queen.
And?
Your Majesty-
I have to tell Your Majesty that, even from my preliminary investigations, we believe the allegations against Queen Katherine have a sound basis in fact...
The Queen received the attentions of her music master,
Henry Manox, when she lived with the Dowager Duchess of Norfolk.
Manox swears under oath that she never gave him her maidenhead...
But that instead it was given to a man called Francis Dereham.
There is ample proof that they spent many nights together...
Naked.
Dereham claims that he was pre-contracted to the Queen, so he did no wrong by having carnal relations with her, and that their relationship was over when he left for Ireland and the Queen for Your Majesty's court.
Unfortunately...
Queen Katherine took this same Dereham back into her employment during Your Majesty's late progress, appointing him her personal secretary and usher.
I have to say that she has betrayed you in thought- and if she had an opportunity- would have betrayed you in deed.
My Lady.
Sir Thomas?
What is it?
Madam, I have come to tell you that for your offences against the King, all your household has been discharged.
Your coffers and chests will be sealed and placed under guard, and I am also come here to collect all your jewels and return them to His Majesty.
Please, Sir Thomas- Everything in here is where is the King?
I must see him.
Madam, I must tell you that the King and his Council have ordained that, for your offences, you have forfeited the title of Queen, and must be known as Lady Katherine Howard.
You will be taken to Syon Abbey today, to wait upon the King's further pleasure.
Where is the King?
I need to speak to him.
You don't understand.
I have to speak to him.
Then everything will be all right.
Don't you understand?
Everything will be all right.
His Majesty is at Chapel.
But I fear he will not speak to you.
Lady Katherine!
Stop her!
Guards!
Katherine Howard!
Stop!
Katherine Howard!
Stop!
You are arrested.
Stop!
Do not proceed!
Katherine Howard!
- Your Majesty!
I must speak to you.
Please, please, Your Majesty!
Please, it's me-Katherine!
It's Katherine.
It's Katherine.
Please.
Please.
Henry!
Henry, please!
No!
Your Majesty!
No, please!
Henry!
No, please!
Please, Henry!
Please!
Risley.
Risley!
Majesty.
Go and fetch Bishop Gardiner.
I must speak to him.
Yes, Your Majesty.
Why are you doing this?
Why are you doing this?
I've already told you everything I know!
His hands, my loves.
His hands.
What are you going to do to me?
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
NO!
Your Grace.
I must warn Your Grace that the poor creature, ever since she came here, has been in such lamentation and heaviness that I never saw in any creature.
Sometimes in a frenzy, that I had to remove every implement that might have harmed her.
Lady Katherine!
Lady Katherine!
Bishop Gardiner is come to see you.
Lady Katherine?
Lady Katherine, do not weep, for I am come here with a letter from His Majesty which offers you his most gracious mercy.
Madam, the King offers you mercy.
What?
What did you say?
Here is His Majesty's letter.
In it, he offers you mercy, despite the- uh-grievous offences you have committed against him, if you will only openly confess your faults.
There.
You see?
I humbly thank the King, who has shown me more grace and mercy than I could have hoped for.
But, first, I must ask you some questions.
And you must answer as truthfully and honestly as you will reply at the Day of Judgment.
Katherine!
The King offers his hand in mercy.
There is nothing to be frightened of.
Come.
Come!
Sit down.
Alas, my Lord, that I am alive!
The fear of death does not grieve me as much as the remembrance of the King's goodness,
for when I remember how gracious and loving a Prince
I had, I cannot but sorrow.
But this sudden mercy, more than I could have looked for, makes my offences appear to my eyes more heinous than they did before.
You confess that this Francis Dereham came often to your bed at Lambeth?
Yes, my Lord.
He has lain with me, sometimes in his doublet and hose, and sometimes naked, but I mean, not so naked that he had nothing upon him, for he had always his doublet on; but I mean
naked when his hose was pulled down.
In order to know you carnally?
Was there a pre-contract between you?
Did you intend to marry him?
He sometimes called me "wife" when we were together, and I called him "husband."
Still-I think it was no contract.
If there was a contract, then your marriage to the King would be invalid- you might face shame...
But you would not forfeit your life.
He promised to love me with all his heart...
But I think it was no contract.
Did Dereham have carnal knowledge of you after you became Queen?
No, my Lord.
He never did.
I will go back to London and draft a plea of forgiveness for you to submit to the King.
Wait!
I have important things to say.
My Lady?
I never consented to sex with Francis Dereham.
He used importunate force against me.
In a manner-violence.
He raped you?
The Queen confessed?
Yes.
She told me that Dereham raped her.
I'm sure she was lying as
I'm sure she's lying about other things too.
But I do believe that there was some form of pre-contract between them, which would invalidate the marriage.
And she claims to be innocent after the marriage?
Of course.
And you believed that?
You don't believe it?
I don't believe anything Dereham says.
It might not be Dereham.
Why does Your Grace say that?
You have the Queen's confession?
Yes, Your Majesty.
The Queen begs for mercy.
She confesses that she was so desirous to be taken into Your Grace's favour, so blinded by desire for worldly glory, that she did not consider how great a fault it was to conceal her former faults from Your Majesty.
"Considering that I intended
"ever during my life
"to be faithful and true to Your Majesty."
Then we can proceed with the annulment?
I think it would be best, Your Majesty.
I don't believe that you didn't have carnal knowledge of the Queen after her marriage to the King.
Please don't!
It is the truth- because someone else had succeeded me in her affections.
Who?
WHO?
Thomas Culpepper.
Thomas Culpepper?
The King's groom?
Yes, sir.
How well did you know this man, Thomas Culpepper?
Quite well.
I flirted with him and met him sometimes by the back stairs, and gave him gifts.
He called me his " sweet little fool."
And did you commit adultery with him?
No, my Lord.
I never did- although Lady Rochford encouraged me to do so.
Lady Rochford encouraged you?
Yes, she did.
And then she spread a vile rumour that we were lovers, which we never were.
You don't deny that you met with the Queen in secret on many occasions?
No, my Lord.
But you deny that you ever committed adultery with her?
I do.
We never passed beyond words.
If you don't tell me the truth, Mr. Culpepper, you will be tortured till you do.
I'm telling you the truth.
Which isn't to say I didn't want to go further!
I intended and meant to do so with the Queen, and she with me.
My God.
That evil intent in itself constitutes high treason.
But it was Katherine who led me on!
She wanted it, not me.
And her servant, Lady Rochford, she provoked it and acted as a procuress, like some madam in a brothel!
Why are they blaming me?
It's not my fault.
I had to stand guard when they met in the Queen's chambers, or even her stool closet.
I didn't want to.
I didn't like doing it.
Once I even had to stop the King coming into the Queen's bedchamber, because Culpepper was already there.
Do you think they had carnal knowledge at those times?
I cannot think it otherwise, considering all the things I heard and saw between them.
Guard!
Do you think I shall die, my Lord?
Do you think I shall die?
Constable!
Open up!
Your Majesty asked me at the beginning of this investigation not to desist until I had got to the bottom of the pot.
Majesty, I fear to say that I am already scraping the bottom, and a good companion of Your Majesty, a fellow of trust, seems certain to have betrayed Your Majesty- committing adultery with the Queen, your wife.
Who is he?
Your groom, Thomas Culpepper.
So far, both of them have denied the charges, though neither of them denies the many illicit meetings they had on the backstairs and in the Queen's stool closet during Your Majesty's last progress.
Lady Rochford and other maids of Her Majesty have come forward with corroborating evidence of their frequent intimacies.
Finally, this letter was discovered in Mr. Culpepper's chambers.
It is the Queen's handwriting.
She writes:
"It makes my heart die to think
"I cannot always be in your company."
And, "I heard that you were sick and never longed so much for anything as to see you."
And it is signed:
"Yours as long as life endures
"
-Katherine."
What has happened is your fault!
Your fault!
You solicited me to marry her!
How misfortunate I am to have had so many ill-conditioned wives!
I vow that any pleasure that wicked bitch got from her wantonness will be nothing-nothing- in comparison to the pain she going to feel at the hand of my torturer!
Well done, wife.
What shall we call him?
Thomas.
Very well.
Thomas he is.
You want to ask Lady Rochford some more questions?
- Yes.
- There's no point, Sir Thomas.
Lady Rochford has gone mad.
Death to you!
There you are.
Majesty?
His Grace, the Duke of Suffolk.
You've never read the Bible, have you, Charles?
No, Your Majesty.
I've always allowed others, with more knowledge than I, to read it for me.
In that case, you've missed many great sayings and truths,
Like this one here in the Book of Solomon, where it says:
"The lips of a harlot are "a dropping honeycomb.
"Her throat is softer than oil.
"Yet in the end,
"she is as bitter as wormwood, and as sharp as a double-edged sword."
Why have you come?
King Francis has sent you a letter.
What does it say?
"I am sorry to hear of the displeasure and trouble which has been caused "by the lewd and naughty behaviour of the Queen.
"But knowing my good brother to be a prince of prudence,"
virtue, and honour,
"I do require him to throw off the said displeasure
"and wisely, temperately, like myself,
"not reputing his honour to rest in the lightness of a woman,
"but to thank God of all,
"comforting himself in God's goodness.
"The lightness of women cannot bend the honour of men."
You tell Francis to go-
Tell His Majesty that we are grateful for his solicitations.
Yes, Your Majesty.
What of Dereham and Culpepper?
Have they been arraigned for treason?
They were tried together.
At the last moment, Culpepper changed his plea to guilty, but both were found so.
They are due to be hanged, drawn and quartered together at Tyburn.
Tell the judge to commute Culpepper's sentencing to beheading.
I hate Dereham more, since he spoiled the Queen for me.
Now, what of Lady Rochford?
She has been found guilty of misprision and treason- but, since she is insane, she cannot be executed.
You tell Richard Rich to pass a bill in Parliament making it legal to execute an insane person for treason.
Do you hear?
Yes, Your Majesty.
You were one of those who placed Katherine Howard in front of me.
Were you not, your Grace?
Any regrets?
Charles.
Majesty.
You should be ashamed of yourselves!
Traitor!
"Master Culpepper,
"I heartily recommend me unto you,
"praying you to send me word how that you do.
"I heard that you were sick,
"and never longed so much for anything as to see you.
"I would you were with me now that you might see
"what pain I take in writing to you.
"It makes my heart die to think
"I cannot always be in your company."
I beg you all to pray for me.
"He, Dereham,
"gave me lots of lovers' tokens.
"He knew a little woman in London with a crooked back,
"who was skilled in making flowers of silk,
"who made for him a French fennel to give to me.
"And later, a heart's ease for a New Year's present,
"and some sarcenet, which I had made into a quilted cap.
"He called me "wife,"
"and touched the secret parts of my body.
"I remember I gave him a collar and sleeves for a shirt.
"And one day,
"he snatched a silver bracelet from me and kept it,
"saying, 'Here, wife, "'a gift for me.'
"And he kissed me often and so passionately
"that everyone said he would never have kissed me enough."
No!
No!
Katherine Howard, you are indicted for having led an abominable, base, carnal, voluptuous, and vicious life before marriage like a common harlot- with several persons.
You led the King by word and gesture to love you, concealing your contract with Francis Dereham to the peril of the King and his children begotten by you.
And after marriage, you showed the same Dereham notable favour, while inciting Thomas Culpepper to carnal knowledge, telling him you loved him above the King.
It is my duty to escort you to the Tower.
My Lady.
Sir Edward.
Don't let them.
No.
Thomas?
Oh God!
Oh, Thomas!
- My Lady.
- No, no, no, no!
No, no!
No, No!
No, Thomas!
Is she condemned?
Yes, Your Majesty.
What of the others?
Dereham and Culpepper have been executed and the bill allowing a mad person to be executed for treason has become law.
I want to have a party.
Here is a list of guests.
Yes, Your Majesty.
Katherine Howard, I have to tell you that you are going to die.
You will be taken to your place of execution tomorrow morning, the 13th of February, escorted by members of the Privy Council.
May I ask one favour?
Will you bring the block to me- so that I might know how to place myself and... make trial of it?
As you wish.
Is there anything else you need?
Do you want a confessor?
No.
I have spoken to God so rarely,
I did not think He would know who I was.
Ladies.
Something sweet?
What do you think?
- Your Majesty.
Ah!
A beautiful Queen.
Madam.
- Do you want to say a few words?
I ask forgiveness for my sins, from His Gracious Majesty,
from God, and from all of you.
Shall I say more?
No, my Lady.
That is already sufficient.
Thank you.
It's time, my Lady.
I have come here to die.
Oh, my Lady!
I die a Queen.
But I would rather die the wife of Culpepper...
Life is very beautiful.
What does this letter say?
I thought Your Majesty just read-
I asked you to tell me what this letter says, my Lord Hertford.
The letter accuses Queen Katherine of dissolute living before she was married to Your Majesty, while she was living with the Dowager Duchess of Norfolk.
There was two men.
A music teacher named Henry Manox, and a gentleman called Francis Dereham.
And that her way of life was not a secret, that many knew of it.
Who wrote the letter?
It is not signed.
Whoever left the letter says he only wrote it because he did not have the heart to tell you by mouth.
It's a forgery!
Yes, Your Majesty.
The accusations in this letter are maliciously intended.
Many calumnies are published about well-known persons, are they not?
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- Nevertheless, my Lord,
I charge you to investigate the matter thoroughly.
Do not desist until you have reached to the bottom of the pot.
- Majesty.
- In the meantime, the Queen shall be confined to her apartments, with only Lady Rochford in attendance- until her name is cleared.
My Lord.
Majesty.
Your Majesty.
No, the other hand.
What?
Sergeant?
What is this?
My Lady, you are confined to your apartments, with only Lady Rochford to attend you, for as long as it please the King.
- No!
- Please, Katherine!
- Joan!
- Don't let them take me!
Joan!
Joan!
Why?
Why must I stay here?
Please tell me.
I don't understand.
Forgive me, my Lady.
But from now on there will be a guard posted just beyond the door.
Please.
Francis Dereham, you are under arrest.
Under arrest for what?
For what, I ask you?
I want to ask you some questions about what went on, some years ago, at Lambeth, between Katherine Howard, as she then was, and two men:
Henry Manox and Francis Dereham.
You know what I'm talking about, don't you?
There's no need to be afraid, Mistress Bulmer.
No harm will come to you- so long as you tell me the truth!
Is that clear?
Yes, sir.
I understand that this man,
Henry Manox, was a music teacher?
Did you ever see him or hear of him taking liberties with Katherine Howard?
Yes, sir.
He told me he was in love with her.
I told him,
I said if my lady of Norfolk knew of the love between him and Mistress Howard, she would undo him, because she is from a noble house, and if you marry her, some of her blood will kill you.
And what did Manox say?

"of a dishonest kind.
I doubt not I shall achieve my purpose."
She said to him that he would have her maidenhead, though it be painful to her, knowing he'd be good to her afterwards.

She was not the Queen.
Let me ask again.

I wanted to show you what we do to people who are dishonest.
Who don't tell the truth.
I'll tell you the truth.
Certain accusations have been made against the Queen.
What kind of accusations?
Oh, that she was light, immoral, dissolute...
With certain men...
Before she came to court.
I can't believe it to be true.
But since the accusations are made,
I must know all the facts.
But since this inquisition is in progress, be careful who you speak to.
I'll have no spark of scandal against her name.
Yes, Your Majesty.
I have a good hand.
What do they know?
Why have I been confined like this?
I don't know.
Someone has told them something!
Who?
What has he told them?
What has he told them?
Why are you crying like this?
It's not about you!
I have to speak to him.
I have to speak to the King.
He'll understand.
We have some evidence that Katherine Howard gave you a gold chain and rich cap, as a gift.
Why did she buy you such gifts?
Because she loved me.
Loved you?
Yes, my Lord.
She told me: "I promise you
"I do love you with all my heart."

Eustace!
Please, sit.

You are too gracious.
I had to see you.
There are many rumours at court.
And it seems the Queen has been confined to her apartments.
Why?
Nobody knows.
But the rumours speak of her misconduct.
I knew it.
I knew she was always a light young woman, dedicated only to pleasure.
And the sad fact is, Lady Mary, that the Howards are a great Catholic family.
No, Eustace, the sad fact is that Katherine Howard was never a good Catholic, nor ever a good wife.
Nor even less a Queen!

Only that he'd slept with the Queen before she was married.
Do you believe him?
I don't know.

Husband, you must be careful.
If you remember, you were among those who offered Katherine Howard up to the King.
Do you suppose I ever forget that?
But that's why I must be harder on her than anyone else.
Since I was the most deceived.
I must to bed.
I have things to do in the morning.
I bid thee, all three of thee, good night.
Good night, brother.
So...
What shall we call your child, Thomas?
Sir Edward- can you not tell me what's happening?
I beg you.
No one tells me anything.
Please... please...
- Madam, I am forbidden to talk to you.
No, no.
You must speak to me.
Madam, I can't...
On my life!
Just something!
Why am I confined here?
What has anyone said?
They have taken Dereham to the Tower.
Also some of the maids who attended the Dowager Duchess.
Oh... my God.
That's all I know.
Now, Madam, you will have to excuse me.
I can say no more.
His Majesty the King.
Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.
Your Grace?
Your Majesty, my Lord Hertford, and other Councillors, have made diligent inquiries into the question of the misconduct of the Queen.
And?
Your Majesty-
I have to tell Your Majesty that, even from my preliminary investigations, we believe the allegations against Queen Katherine have a sound basis in fact...
The Queen received the attentions of her music master,
Henry Manox, when she lived with the Dowager Duchess of Norfolk.
Manox swears under oath that she never gave him her maidenhead...
But that instead it was given to a man called Francis Dereham.
There is ample proof that they spent many nights together...
Naked.
Dereham claims that he was pre-contracted to the Queen, so he did no wrong by having carnal relations with her, and that their relationship was over when he left for Ireland and the Queen for Your Majesty's court.
Unfortunately...
Queen Katherine took this same Dereham back into her employment during Your Majesty's late progress, appointing him her personal secretary and usher.
I have to say that she has betrayed you in thought- and if she had an opportunity- would have betrayed you in deed.
My Lady.
Sir Thomas?
What is it?
Madam, I have come to tell you that for your offences against the King, all your household has been discharged.
Your coffers and chests will be sealed and placed under guard, and I am also come here to collect all your jewels and return them to His Majesty.
Please, Sir Thomas- Everything in here is where is the King?
I must see him.
Madam, I must tell you that the King and his Council have ordained that, for your offences, you have forfeited the title of Queen, and must be known as Lady Katherine Howard.
You will be taken to Syon Abbey today, to wait upon the King's further pleasure.
Where is the King?
I need to speak to him.
You don't understand.
I have to speak to him.
Then everything will be all right.
Don't you understand?
Everything will be all right.
His Majesty is at Chapel.
But I fear he will not speak to you.
Lady Katherine!
Stop her!
Guards!
Katherine Howard!
Stop!
Katherine Howard!
Stop!
You are arrested.
Stop!
Do not proceed!
Katherine Howard!
- Your Majesty!
I must speak to you.
Please, please, Your Majesty!
Please, it's me-Katherine!
It's Katherine.
It's Katherine.
Please.
Please.
Henry!
Henry, please!
No!
Your Majesty!
No, please!
Henry!
No, please!
Please, Henry!
Please!
Risley.
Risley!
Majesty.
Go and fetch Bishop Gardiner.
I must speak to him.
Yes, Your Majesty.
Why are you doing this?
Why are you doing this?
I've already told you everything I know!
His hands, my loves.
His hands.
What are you going to do to me?
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
NO!
Your Grace.
I must warn Your Grace that the poor creature, ever since she came here, has been in such lamentation and heaviness that I never saw in any creature.
Sometimes in a frenzy, that I had to remove every implement that might have harmed her.
Lady Katherine!
Lady Katherine!
Bishop Gardiner is come to see you.
Lady Katherine?
Lady Katherine, do not weep, for I am come here with a letter from His Majesty which offers you his most gracious mercy.
Madam, the King offers you mercy.
What?
What did you say?
Here is His Majesty's letter.
In it, he offers you mercy, despite the- uh-grievous offences you have committed against him, if you will only openly confess your faults.
There.
You see?
I humbly thank the King, who has shown me more grace and mercy than I could have hoped for.
But, first, I must ask you some questions.
And you must answer as truthfully and honestly as you will reply at the Day of Judgment.
Katherine!
The King offers his hand in mercy.
There is nothing to be frightened of.
Come.
Come!
Sit down.
Alas, my Lord, that I am alive!
The fear of death does not grieve me as much as the remembrance of the King's goodness,
for when I remember how gracious and loving a Prince
I had, I cannot but sorrow.
But this sudden mercy, more than I could have looked for, makes my offences appear to my eyes more heinous than they did before.
You confess that this Francis Dereham came often to your bed at Lambeth?
Yes, my Lord.
He has lain with me, sometimes in his doublet and hose, and sometimes naked, but I mean, not so naked that he had nothing upon him, for he had always his doublet on; but I mean
naked when his hose was pulled down.
In order to know you carnally?
Was there a pre-contract between you?
Did you intend to marry him?
He sometimes called me "wife" when we were together, and I called him "husband."
Still-I think it was no contract.
If there was a contract, then your marriage to the King would be invalid- you might face shame...
But you would not forfeit your life.
He promised to love me with all his heart...
But I think it was no contract.
Did Dereham have carnal knowledge of you after you became Queen?
No, my Lord.
He never did.
I will go back to London and draft a plea of forgiveness for you to submit to the King.
Wait!
I have important things to say.
My Lady?
I never consented to sex with Francis Dereham.
He used importunate force against me.
In a manner-violence.
He raped you?
The Queen confessed?
Yes.
She told me that Dereham raped her.
I'm sure she was lying as
I'm sure she's lying about other things too.
But I do believe that there was some form of pre-contract between them, which would invalidate the marriage.
And she claims to be innocent after the marriage?
Of course.
And you believed that?
You don't believe it?
I don't believe anything Dereham says.
It might not be Dereham.
Why does Your Grace say that?
You have the Queen's confession?
Yes, Your Majesty.
The Queen begs for mercy.
She confesses that she was so desirous to be taken into Your Grace's favour, so blinded by desire for worldly glory, that she did not consider how great a fault it was to conceal her former faults from Your Majesty.
"Considering that I intended
"ever during my life
"to be faithful and true to Your Majesty."
Then we can proceed with the annulment?
I think it would be best, Your Majesty.
I don't believe that you didn't have carnal knowledge of the Queen after her marriage to the King.
Please don't!
It is the truth- because someone else had succeeded me in her affections.
Who?
WHO?
Thomas Culpepper.
Thomas Culpepper?
The King's groom?
Yes, sir.
How well did you know this man, Thomas Culpepper?
Quite well.
I flirted with him and met him sometimes by the back stairs, and gave him gifts.
He called me his " sweet little fool."
And did you commit adultery with him?
No, my Lord.
I never did- although Lady Rochford encouraged me to do so.
Lady Rochford encouraged you?
Yes, she did.
And then she spread a vile rumour that we were lovers, which we never were.
You don't deny that you met with the Queen in secret on many occasions?
No, my Lord.
But you deny that you ever committed adultery with her?
I do.
We never passed beyond words.
If you don't tell me the truth, Mr. Culpepper, you will be tortured till you do.
I'm telling you the truth.
Which isn't to say I didn't want to go further!
I intended and meant to do so with the Queen, and she with me.
My God.
That evil intent in itself constitutes high treason.
But it was Katherine who led me on!
She wanted it, not me.
And her servant, Lady Rochford, she provoked it and acted as a procuress, like some madam in a brothel!
Why are they blaming me?
It's not my fault.
I had to stand guard when they met in the Queen's chambers, or even her stool closet.
I didn't want to.
I didn't like doing it.
Once I even had to stop the King coming into the Queen's bedchamber, because Culpepper was already there.
Do you think they had carnal knowledge at those times?
I cannot think it otherwise, considering all the things I heard and saw between them.
Guard!
Do you think I shall die, my Lord?
Do you think I shall die?
Constable!
Open up!
Your Majesty asked me at the beginning of this investigation not to desist until I had got to the bottom of the pot.
Majesty, I fear to say that I am already scraping the bottom, and a good companion of Your Majesty, a fellow of trust, seems certain to have betrayed Your Majesty- committing adultery with the Queen, your wife.
Who is he?
Your groom, Thomas Culpepper.
So far, both of them have denied the charges, though neither of them denies the many illicit meetings they had on the backstairs and in the Queen's stool closet during Your Majesty's last progress.
Lady Rochford and other maids of Her Majesty have come forward with corroborating evidence of their frequent intimacies.
Finally, this letter was discovered in Mr. Culpepper's chambers.
It is the Queen's handwriting.
She writes:
"It makes my heart die to think
"I cannot always be in your company."
And, "I heard that you were sick and never longed so much for anything as to see you."
And it is signed:
"Yours as long as life endures
"
-Katherine."
What has happened is your fault!
Your fault!
You solicited me to marry her!
How misfortunate I am to have had so many ill-conditioned wives!
I vow that any pleasure that wicked bitch got from her wantonness will be nothing-nothing- in comparison to the pain she going to feel at the hand of my torturer!
Well done, wife.
What shall we call him?
Thomas.
Very well.
Thomas he is.
You want to ask Lady Rochford some more questions?
- Yes.
- There's no point, Sir Thomas.
Lady Rochford has gone mad.
Death to you!
There you are.
Majesty?
His Grace, the Duke of Suffolk.
You've never read the Bible, have you, Charles?
No, Your Majesty.
I've always allowed others, with more knowledge than I, to read it for me.
In that case, you've missed many great sayings and truths,
Like this one here in the Book of Solomon, where it says:
"The lips of a harlot are "a dropping honeycomb.
"Her throat is softer than oil.
"Yet in the end,
"she is as bitter as wormwood, and as sharp as a double-edged sword."
Why have you come?
King Francis has sent you a letter.
What does it say?
"I am sorry to hear of the displeasure and trouble which has been caused "by the lewd and naughty behaviour of the Queen.
"But knowing my good brother to be a prince of prudence,"
virtue, and honour,
"I do require him to throw off the said displeasure
"and wisely, temperately, like myself,
"not reputing his honour to rest in the lightness of a woman,
"but to thank God of all,
"comforting himself in God's goodness.
"The lightness of women cannot bend the honour of men."
You tell Francis to go-
Tell His Majesty that we are grateful for his solicitations.
Yes, Your Majesty.
What of Dereham and Culpepper?
Have they been arraigned for treason?
They were tried together.
At the last moment, Culpepper changed his plea to guilty, but both were found so.
They are due to be hanged, drawn and quartered together at Tyburn.
Tell the judge to commute Culpepper's sentencing to beheading.
I hate Dereham more, since he spoiled the Queen for me.
Now, what of Lady Rochford?
She has been found guilty of misprision and treason- but, since she is insane, she cannot be executed.
You tell Richard Rich to pass a bill in Parliament making it legal to execute an insane person for treason.
Do you hear?
Yes, Your Majesty.
You were one of those who placed Katherine Howard in front of me.
Were you not, your Grace?
Any regrets?
Charles.
Majesty.
You should be ashamed of yourselves!
Traitor!
"Master Culpepper,
"I heartily recommend me unto you,
"praying you to send me word how that you do.
"I heard that you were sick,
"and never longed so much for anything as to see you.
"I would you were with me now that you might see
"what pain I take in writing to you.
"It makes my heart die to think
"I cannot always be in your company."
I beg you all to pray for me.
"He, Dereham,
"gave me lots of lovers' tokens.
"He knew a little woman in London with a crooked back,
"who was skilled in making flowers of silk,
"who made for him a French fennel to give to me.
"And later, a heart's ease for a New Year's present,
"and some sarcenet, which I had made into a quilted cap.
"He called me "wife,"
"and touched the secret parts of my body.
"I remember I gave him a collar and sleeves for a shirt.
"And one day,
"he snatched a silver bracelet from me and kept it,
"saying, 'Here, wife, "'a gift for me.'
"And he kissed me often and so passionately
"that everyone said he would never have kissed me enough."
No!
No!
Katherine Howard, you are indicted for having led an abominable, base, carnal, voluptuous, and vicious life before marriage like a common harlot- with several persons.
You led the King by word and gesture to love you, concealing your contract with Francis Dereham to the peril of the King and his children begotten by you.
And after marriage, you showed the same Dereham notable favour, while inciting Thomas Culpepper to carnal knowledge, telling him you loved him above the King.
It is my duty to escort you to the Tower.
My Lady.
Sir Edward.
Don't let them.
No.
Thomas?
Oh God!
Oh, Thomas!
- My Lady.
- No, no, no, no!
No, no!
No, No!
No, Thomas!
Is she condemned?
Yes, Your Majesty.
What of the others?
Dereham and Culpepper have been executed and the bill allowing a mad person to be executed for treason has become law.
I want to have a party.
Here is a list of guests.
Yes, Your Majesty.
Katherine Howard, I have to tell you that you are going to die.
You will be taken to your place of execution tomorrow morning, the 13th of February, escorted by members of the Privy Council.
May I ask one favour?
Will you bring the block to me- so that I might know how to place myself and... make trial of it?
As you wish.
Is there anything else you need?
Do you want a confessor?
No.
I have spoken to God so rarely,
I did not think He would know who I was.
Ladies.
Something sweet?
What do you think?
- Your Majesty.
Ah!
A beautiful Queen.
Madam.
- Do you want to say a few words?
I ask forgiveness for my sins, from His Gracious Majesty,
from God, and from all of you.
Shall I say more?
No, my Lady.
That is already sufficient.
Thank you.
It's time, my Lady.
I have come here to die.
Oh, my Lady!
I die a Queen.
But I would rather die the wife of Culpepper...
Life is very beautiful.
What does this letter say?
I thought Your Majesty just read...
I asked you to tell me what this letter says, my Lord Hertford.
The letter accuses Queen Katherine of dissolute living before she was married to Your Majesty, while she was living with the Dowager Duchess of Norfolk.
There was two men.
A music teacher named Henry Manox, and a gentleman called Francis Dereham.
And that her way of life was not a secret, that many knew of it.
Who wrote the letter?
It is not signed.
Whoever left the letter says he only wrote it because he did not have the heart to tell you by mouth.
It's a forgery!
Yes, Your Majesty.
The accusations in this letter are maliciously intended.
Many calumnies are published about well-known persons, are they not?
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- Nevertheless, my Lord,
I charge you to investigate the matter thoroughly.
Do not desist until you have reached to the bottom of the pot.
- Majesty.
- In the meantime, the Queen shall be confined to her apartments, with only Lady Rochford in attendance... until her name is cleared.
My Lord.
Majesty.
Your Majesty.
No, the other hand.
What?
Sergeant?
What is this?
My Lady, you are confined to your apartments, with only Lady Rochford to attend you, for as long as it please the King.
- No!
- Please, Katherine!
- Joan!
- Don't let them take me!
Joan!
Joan!
Why?
Why must I stay here?
Please tell me.
I don't understand.
Forgive me, my Lady.
But from now on there will be a guard posted just beyond the door.
Please.
Francis Dereham, you are under arrest.
Under arrest for what?
For what, I ask you?
I want to ask you some questions about what went on, some years ago, at Lambeth, between Katherine Howard, as she then was, and two men:
Henry Manox and Francis Dereham.
You know what I'm talking about, don't you?
There's no need to be afraid, Mistress Bulmer.
No harm will come to you... so long as you tell me the truth!
Is that clear?
Yes, sir.
I understand that this man,
Henry Manox, was a music teacher?
Did you ever see him or hear of him taking liberties with Katherine Howard?
Yes, sir.
He told me he was in love with her.
I told him,
I said if my lady of Norfolk knew of the love between him and Mistress Howard, she would undo him, because she is from a noble house, and if you marry her, some of her blood will kill you.
And what did Manox say?
He said, "Hold your peace, woman!
My designs are"
"of a dishonest kind.
I doubt not I shall achieve my purpose."
She said to him that he would have her maidenhead, though it be painful to her, knowing he'd be good to her afterwards.
And did he... have her maidenhead?
No, sir, for she started seeing someone else.
And would that man be Francis Dereham?
Yes, my Lord.
Did you know Katherine Howard at Lambeth, when she was 14 or 15 years old?
Yes, sir.
Did you have carnal knowledge of her?
We... played some games.
We pretended to be man and wife.
It amused her.
Did you know her carnally?
You should know, Mr. Dereham, that we have spoken to some of the maids who used to sleep in the same dormitory.
They say that you crept into the Queen's bed for
- a hundred nights or more.
- She was not the Queen.
Let me ask again.
Did you have carnal knowledge of Katherine Howard?
No!
I thought you were not altogether honest with me, Mr. Dereham.
I wanted to show you what we do to people who are dishonest.
Who don't tell the truth.
I'll tell you the truth.
Certain accusations have been made against the Queen.
What kind of accusations?
Oh, that she was light, immoral, dissolute... with certain men... before she came to court.
I can't believe it to be true.
But since the accusations are made,
I must know all the facts.
But since this inquisition is in progress, be careful who you speak to.
I'll have no spark of scandal against her name.
Yes, Your Majesty.
I have a good hand.
What do they know?
Why have I been confined like this?
I don't know.
Someone has told them something!
Who?
What has he told them?
What has he told them?
Why are you crying like this?
It's not about you!
I have to speak to him.
I have to speak to the King.
He'll understand.
We have some evidence that Katherine Howard gave you a gold chain and rich cap, as a gift.
Why did she buy you such gifts?
Because she loved me.
Loved you?
Yes, my Lord.
She told me: "I promise you"
"I do love you with all my heart."
She promised by her faith and troth that she would take no other husband but me.
You were pre-contracted then?
Yes, sir.
It was understood between us that we would get married.
That's why...
That's why you knew her carnally?
Yes, sir.
We didn't think we were doing anything wrong.
She was going to be my wife and I her husband.
We'd made promises before God.
Why did you not marry her, then?
I left Lambeth for a while and went to Ireland.
When I returned, Katherine was already at court.
The Queen recently took you back into her employment.
On what grounds?
The Dowager Duchess was kind enough to speak highly of my talents.
You have admitted to the fact that you had carnal knowledge of the Queen before her marriage to the King.
But did you also know her carnally afterwards?
No, sir!
No!
On my honour!
On your honour, Mr. Dereham?
My Lady?
His Excellency is here.
Eustace!
Please, sit.
Thank you, Lady Mary.
You are too gracious.
I had to see you.
There are many rumours at court.
And it seems the Queen has been confined to her apartments.
Why?
Nobody knows.
But the rumours speak of her misconduct.
I knew it.
I knew she was always a light young woman, dedicated only to pleasure.
And the sad fact is, Lady Mary, that the Howards are a great Catholic family.
No, Eustace, the sad fact is that Katherine Howard was never a good Catholic, nor ever a good wife.
Nor even less a Queen!
What have you discovered?
Katherine Howard was a loose young woman.
You surely knew that!
I was told that her upbringing had been unconventional.
I didn't know how unconventional.
I didn't suspect that at fourteen years old she was sleeping with two older men!
You met her!
You saw the look in her eyes.
She was never innocent.
And who is innocent, my sweetheart?
What did Dereham confess?
Only that he'd slept with the Queen before she was married.
Do you believe him?
I don't know.
I may ask again.
Husband, you must be careful.
If you remember, you were among those who offered Katherine Howard up to the King.
Do you suppose I ever forget that?
But that's why I must be harder on her than anyone else.
Since I was the most deceived.
I must to bed.
I have things to do in the morning.
I bid thee, all three of thee, good night.
Good night, brother.
So...
What shall we call your child, Thomas?
Sir Edward... can you not tell me what's happening?
I beg you.
No one tells me anything.
- Please... please...
- Madam, I am forbidden to talk to you.
No, no.
You must speak to me.
Madam, I can't...
On my life!
Just something!
Why am I confined here?
What has anyone said?
They have taken Dereham to the Tower.
Also some of the maids who attended the Dowager Duchess.
Oh... my God.
That's all I know.
Now, Madam, you will have to excuse me.
I can say no more.
His Majesty the King.
Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.
Your Grace?
Your Majesty, my Lord Hertford, and other Councillors, have made diligent inquiries into the question of the misconduct of the Queen.

It's Katherine.
It's Katherine.

I don't believe that you didn't have carnal knowledge of the Queen after her marriage to the King.
Please don't!
It is the truth... because someone else had succeeded me in her affections.
Who?
Who?
Thomas Culpepper.
Thomas Culpepper?
The King's groom?
Yes, sir.
How well did you know this man, Thomas Culpepper?
Quite well.
I flirted with him and met him sometimes by the back stairs, and gave him gifts.
He called me his "sweet little fool."
And did you commit adultery with him?
No, my Lord.
I never did... although Lady Rochford encouraged me to do so.
Lady Rochford encouraged you?
Yes, she did.
And then she spread a vile rumour that we were lovers, which we never were.
You don't deny that you met with the Queen
- in secret on many occasions?
- No, my Lord.
But you deny that you ever committed adultery with her?
I do.
We never passed beyond words.
If you don't tell me the truth, Mr. Culpepper, you will be tortured till you do.
I'm telling you the truth.
Which isn't to say I didn't want to go further!
I intended and meant to do so with the Queen, and she with me.
My God.
That evil intent in itself constitutes high treason.
But it was Katherine who led me on!
She wanted it, not me.
And her servant, Lady Rochford, she provoked it and acted as a procuress, like some madam in a brothel!
Why are they blaming me?
It's not my fault.
I had to stand guard when they met in the Queen's chambers, or even her stool closet.
I didn't want to.
I didn't like doing it.
Once I even had to stop the King coming into the Queen's bedchamber, because Culpepper was already there.
Do you think they had carnal knowledge at those times?
I cannot think it otherwise, considering all the things I heard and saw between them.
Guard!
Do you think I shall die, my Lord?
Do you think I shall die?
Constable!
Open up!
Your Majesty asked me at the beginning of this investigation not to desist until I had got to the bottom of the pot.
Majesty, I fear to say that I am already scraping the bottom, and a good companion of Your Majesty, a fellow of trust, seems certain to have betrayed Your Majesty... committing adultery with the Queen, your wife.
Who is he?
Your groom, Thomas Culpepper.
So far, both of them have denied the charges, though neither of them denies the many illicit meetings they had on the backstairs and in the Queen's stool closet during Your Majesty's last progress.
Lady Rochford and other maids of Her Majesty have come forward with corroborating evidence of their frequent intimacies.
Finally, this letter was discovered in Mr. Culpepper's chambers.
It is the Queen's handwriting.
She writes:
"It makes my heart die to think"
"I cannot always be in your company."
And, "I heard that you were" sick and never longed so much for anything as to see you."
And it is signed:
"Yours as long as life endures..."
"Katherine."
What has happened is your fault!
Your fault!
You solicited me to marry her!
How misfortunate I am to have had so many ill-conditioned wives!
I vow that any pleasure that wicked bitch got from her wantonness will be nothing... nothing... in comparison to the pain she going to feel at the hand of my torturer!
Well done, wife.
What shall we call him?
Thomas.
Very well.
Thomas he is.
You want to ask Lady Rochford some more questions?
- Yes.
- There's no point, Sir Thomas.
Lady Rochford has gone mad.
Death to you!
There you are.
Majesty?
His Grace, the Duke of Suffolk.
You've never read the Bible, have you, Charles?
No, Your Majesty.
I've always allowed others, with more knowledge than I, to read it for me.
In that case, you've missed many great sayings and truths,
Like this one here in the Book of Solomon, where it says:
"The lips of a harlot are a dropping honeycomb."
"Her throat is softer than oil."
"Yet in the end,"
"she is as bitter as wormwood,"
and as sharp as a double-edged sword."
Why have you come?
King Francis has sent you a letter.
What does it say?
"I am sorry to hear of the displeasure and trouble which has been"
"caused by the lewd and naughty behaviour of the Queen."
"But knowing my good brother to be a prince of prudence,"
"virtue, and honour,"
"I do require him to throw off the said displeasure"
"and wisely, temperately, like myself,"
"not reputing his honour to rest in the lightness of a woman,"
"but to thank God of all,"
"comforting himself in God's goodness."
"The lightness of women cannot bend the honour of men."
You tell Francis to go...
Tell His Majesty that we are grateful for his solicitations.
Yes, Your Majesty.
What of Dereham and Culpepper?
Have they been arraigned for treason?
They were tried together.
At the last moment, Culpepper changed his plea to guilty, but both were found so.
They are due to be hanged, drawn and quartered together at Tyburn.
Tell the judge to commute Culpepper's sentencing to beheading.
I hate Dereham more, since he spoiled the Queen for me.
Now, what of Lady Rochford?
She has been found guilty of misprision and treason... but, since she is insane, she cannot be executed.
You tell Richard Rich to pass a bill in Parliament making it legal to execute an insane person for treason.
Do you hear?
Yes, Your Majesty.
You were one of those who placed Katherine Howard in front of me.
Were you not, your Grace?
Any regrets?
Charles.
Majesty.
You should be ashamed of yourselves!
Traitor!
Master Culpepper,
I heartily recommend me unto you, praying you to send me word how that you do.
I heard that you were sick, and never longed so much for anything as to see you.
I would you were with me now that you might see what pain I take in writing to you.
It makes my heart die to think
I cannot always be in your company.
I beg you all to pray for me.
He, Dereham, gave me lots of lovers' tokens.
He knew a little woman in London with a crooked back, who was skilled in making flowers of silk, who made for him a French fennel to give to me.
And later, a heart's ease for a New Year's present, and some sarcenet, which I had made into a quilted cap.
He called me "wife,"
and touched the secret parts of my body.
I remember I gave him a collar and sleeves for a shirt.
And one day, he snatched a silver bracelet from me and kept it, saying, "Here, wife, a gift for me."
And he kissed me often and so passionately that everyone said he would never have kissed me enough.
No!
No!
Katherine Howard, you are indicted for having led an abominable, base, carnal, voluptuous, and vicious life before marriage like a common harlot... with several persons.
You led the King by word and gesture to love you, concealing your contract with Francis Dereham to the peril of the King and his children begotten by you.
And after marriage, you showed the same Dereham notable favour, while inciting Thomas Culpepper to carnal knowledge, telling him you loved him above the King.
It is my duty to escort you to the Tower.
My Lady.
Sir Edward.
Don't let them.
No.
Thomas?
Oh God!
Oh, Thomas!
- My Lady.
- No, no, no, no!
No, no!
No, No!
No, Thomas!
Is she condemned?
Yes, Your Majesty.
What of the others?
Dereham and Culpepper have been executed and the bill allowing a mad person to be executed for treason has become law.
I want to have a party.
Here is a list of guests.
Yes, Your Majesty.
Katherine Howard, I have to tell you that you are going to die.
You will be taken to your place of execution tomorrow morning, the 13th of February, escorted by members of the Privy Council.
May I ask one favour?
Will you bring the block to me... so that I might know how to place myself and... make trial of it?
As you wish.
Is there anything else you need?
Do you want a confessor?
No.
I have spoken to God so rarely,
I did not think He would know who I was.
Ladies.
Something sweet?
- What do you think?
- Your Majesty.
Ah!
A beautiful Queen.
Madam, do you want to say a few words?
I ask forgiveness for my sins, from His Gracious Majesty,
from God, and from all of you.
Shall I say more?
No, my Lady.
That is already sufficient.
Thank you.
It's time, my Lady.
I have come here to die.
Oh, my Lady!
I die a Queen.
But I would rather die the wife of Culpepper...
Life is very beautiful.
No, the other hand.
What?
Sergeant?
What is this?
My Lady, you are confined to your apartments, with only Lady Rochford to attend you, for as long as it please the King.
- No!
- Please, Katherine!
- Joan!
- Don't let them take me!
Joan!
Joan!
Why?
Why must I stay here?
Please tell me.
I don't understand.
Forgive me, my Lady.
But from now on there will be a guard posted just beyond the door.
Please.
Francis Dereham, you are under arrest.
Under arrest for what?
For what, I ask you?
I want to ask you some questions about what went on, some years ago, at Lambeth, between Katherine Howard, as she then was, and two men:
Henry Manox and Francis Dereham.
You know what I'm talking about, don't you?
There's no need to be afraid, Mistress Bulmer.
No harm will come to you- so long as you tell me the truth!
Is that clear?
Yes, sir.
I understand that this man,
Henry Manox, was a music teacher?
Did you ever see him or hear of him taking liberties with Katherine Howard?
Yes, sir.
He told me he was in love with her.
I told him,
I said if my lady of Norfolk knew of the love between him and Mistress Howard, she would undo him, because she is from a noble house, and if you marry her, some of her blood will kill you.
And what did Manox say?
He said, "Hold your peace, woman!
My designs are
"of a dishonest kind.
I doubt not I shall achieve my purpose."
She said to him that he would have her maidenhead, though it be painful to her, knowing he'd be good to her afterwards.
And did he-have her maidenhead?
No, sir, for she started seeing someone else.
And would that man be Francis Dereham?
Yes, my Lord.
Did you know Katherine Howard at Lambeth, when she was 14 or 15 years old?
Yes, sir.
Did you have carnal knowledge of her?
We-played some games.
We pretended to be man and wife.
It amused her.
Did you know her carnally?
You should know, Mr. Dereham, that we have spoken to some of the maids who used to sleep in the same dormitory.
They say that you crept into the Queen's bed for a hundred nights or more.
She was not the Queen.
Let me ask again.
Did you have carnal knowledge of Katherine Howard?
No!
I thought you were not altogether honest with me, Mr. Dereham.
I wanted to show you what we do to people who are dishonest.
Who don't tell the truth.
I'll tell you the truth.
Certain accusations have been made against the Queen.
What kind of accusations?
Oh, that she was light, immoral, dissolute...
With certain men...
Before she came to court.
I can't believe it to be true.
But since the accusations are made,
I must know all the facts.
But since this inquisition is in progress, be careful who you speak to.
I'll have no spark of scandal against her name.
Yes, Your Majesty.
I have a good hand.
What do they know?
Why have I been confined like this?
I don't know.
Someone has told them something!
Who?
What has he told them?
What has he told them?
Why are you crying like this?
It's not about you!
I have to speak to him.
I have to speak to the King.
He'll understand.
We have some evidence that Katherine Howard gave you a gold chain and rich cap, as a gift.
Why did she buy you such gifts?
Because she loved me.
Loved you?
Yes, my Lord.
She told me: "I promise you
"I do love you with all my heart."
She promised by her faith and troth that she would take no other husband but me.
You were pre-contracted then?
Yes, sir.
It was understood between us that we would get married.
That's why...
That's why you knew her carnally?
Yes, sir.
We didn't think we were doing anything wrong.
She was going to be my wife and I her husband.
We'd made promises before God.
Why did you not marry her, then?
I left Lambeth for a while and went to Ireland.
When I returned, Katherine was already at court.
The Queen recently took you back into her employment.
On what grounds?
The Dowager Duchess was kind enough to speak highly of my talents.
You have admitted to the fact that you had carnal knowledge of the Queen before her marriage to the King.
But did you also know her carnally afterwards?
No, sir!
No!
On my honour!
On your honour, Mr. Dereham?
My Lady?
His Excellency is here.
Eustace!
Please, sit.
Thank you, Lady Mary.
You are too gracious.
I had to see you.
There are many rumours at court.
And it seems the Queen has been confined to her apartments.
Why?
Nobody knows.
But the rumours speak of her misconduct.
I knew it.
I knew she was always a light young woman, dedicated only to pleasure.
And the sad fact is, Lady Mary, that the Howards are a great Catholic family.
No, Eustace, the sad fact is that Katherine Howard was never a good Catholic, nor ever a good wife.
Nor even less a Queen!
What have you discovered?
Katherine Howard was a loose young woman.
You surely knew that!
I was told that her upbringing had been unconventional.
I didn't know how unconventional.
I didn't suspect that at fourteen years old she was sleeping with two older men!
You met her!
You saw the look in her eyes.
She was never innocent.
And who is innocent, my sweetheart?
What did Dereham confess?
Only that he'd slept with the Queen before she was married.
Do you believe him?
I don't know.
I may ask again.
Husband, you must be careful.
If you remember, you were among those who offered Katherine Howard up to the King.
Do you suppose I ever forget that?
But that's why I must be harder on her than anyone else.
Since I was the most deceived.
I must to bed.
I have things to do in the morning.
I bid thee, all three of thee, good night.
Good night, brother.
So...
What shall we call your child, Thomas?
Sir Edward- can you not tell me what's happening?
I beg you.
No one tells me anything.
Please... please...
- Madam, I am forbidden to talk to you.
No, no.
You must speak to me.
Madam, I can't...
On my life!
Just something!
Why am I confined here?
What has anyone said?
They have taken Dereham to the Tower.
Also some of the maids who attended the Dowager Duchess.
Oh... my God.
That's all I know.
Now, Madam, you will have to excuse me.
I can say no more.
His Majesty the King.
Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.
Your Grace?
Your Majesty, my Lord Hertford, and other Councillors, have made diligent inquiries into the question of the misconduct of the Queen.
And?
Your Majesty-
I have to tell Your Majesty that, even from my preliminary investigations, we believe the allegations against Queen Katherine have a sound basis in fact...
The Queen received the attentions of her music master,
Henry Manox, when she lived with the Dowager Duchess of Norfolk.
Manox swears under oath that she never gave him her maidenhead...
But that instead it was given to a man called Francis Dereham.
There is ample proof that they spent many nights together...
Naked.
Dereham claims that he was pre-contracted to the Queen, so he did no wrong by having carnal relations with her, and that their relationship was over when he left for Ireland and the Queen for Your Majesty's court.
Unfortunately...
Queen Katherine took this same Dereham back into her employment during Your Majesty's late progress, appointing him her personal secretary and usher.
I have to say that she has betrayed you in thought- and if she had an opportunity- would have betrayed you in deed.
My Lady.
Sir Thomas?
What is it?
Madam, I have come to tell you that for your offences against the King, all your household has been discharged.
Your coffers and chests will be sealed and placed under guard, and I am also come here to collect all your jewels and return them to His Majesty.
Please, Sir Thomas- Everything in here is where is the King?
I must see him.
Madam, I must tell you that the King and his Council have ordained that, for your offences, you have forfeited the title of Queen, and must be known as Lady Katherine Howard.
You will be taken to Syon Abbey today, to wait upon the King's further pleasure.
Where is the King?
I need to speak to him.
You don't understand.
I have to speak to him.
Then everything will be all right.
Don't you understand?
Everything will be all right.
His Majesty is at Chapel.
But I fear he will not speak to you.
Lady Katherine!
Stop her!
Guards!
Katherine Howard!
Stop!
Katherine Howard!
Stop!
You are arrested.
Stop!
Do not proceed!
Katherine Howard!
- Your Majesty!
I must speak to you.
Please, please, Your Majesty!
Please, it's me-Katherine!
It's Katherine.
It's Katherine.
Please.
Please.
Henry!
Henry, please!
No!
Your Majesty!
No, please!
Henry!
No, please!
Please, Henry!
Please!
Risley.
Risley!
Majesty.
Go and fetch Bishop Gardiner.
I must speak to him.
Yes, Your Majesty.
Why are you doing this?
Why are you doing this?
I've already told you everything I know!
His hands, my loves.
His hands.
What are you going to do to me?
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
NO!
Your Grace.
I must warn Your Grace that the poor creature, ever since she came here, has been in such lamentation and heaviness that I never saw in any creature.
Sometimes in a frenzy, that I had to remove every implement that might have harmed her.
Lady Katherine!
Lady Katherine!
Bishop Gardiner is come to see you.
Lady Katherine?
Lady Katherine, do not weep, for I am come here with a letter from His Majesty which offers you his most gracious mercy.
Madam, the King offers you mercy.
What?
What did you say?
Here is His Majesty's letter.
In it, he offers you mercy, despite the- uh-grievous offences you have committed against him, if you will only openly confess your faults.
There.
You see?
I humbly thank the King, who has shown me more grace and mercy than I could have hoped for.
But, first, I must ask you some questions.
And you must answer as truthfully and honestly as you will reply at the Day of Judgment.
Katherine!
The King offers his hand in mercy.
There is nothing to be frightened of.
Come.
Come!
Sit down.
Alas, my Lord, that I am alive!
The fear of death does not grieve me as much as the remembrance of the King's goodness,
for when I remember how gracious and loving a Prince
I had, I cannot but sorrow.
But this sudden mercy, more than I could have looked for, makes my offences appear to my eyes more heinous than they did before.
You confess that this Francis Dereham came often to your bed at Lambeth?
Yes, my Lord.
He has lain with me, sometimes in his doublet and hose, and sometimes naked, but I mean, not so naked that he had nothing upon him, for he had always his doublet on; but I mean
naked when his hose was pulled down.
In order to know you carnally?
Was there a pre-contract between you?
Did you intend to marry him?
He sometimes called me "wife" when we were together, and I called him "husband."
Still-I think it was no contract.
If there was a contract, then your marriage to the King would be invalid- you might face shame...
But you would not forfeit your life.
He promised to love me with all his heart...
But I think it was no contract.
Did Dereham have carnal knowledge of you after you became Queen?
No, my Lord.
He never did.
I will go back to London and draft a plea of forgiveness for you to submit to the King.
Wait!
I have important things to say.
My Lady?
I never consented to sex with Francis Dereham.
He used importunate force against me.
In a manner-violence.
He raped you?
The Queen confessed?
Yes.
She told me that Dereham raped her.
I'm sure she was lying as
I'm sure she's lying about other things too.
But I do believe that there was some form of pre-contract between them, which would invalidate the marriage.
And she claims to be innocent after the marriage?
Of course.
And you believed that?
You don't believe it?
I don't believe anything Dereham says.
It might not be Dereham.
Why does Your Grace say that?
You have the Queen's confession?
Yes, Your Majesty.
The Queen begs for mercy.
She confesses that she was so desirous to be taken into Your Grace's favour, so blinded by desire for worldly glory, that she did not consider how great a fault it was to conceal her former faults from Your Majesty.
"Considering that I intended
"ever during my life
"to be faithful and true to Your Majesty."
Then we can proceed with the annulment?
I think it would be best, Your Majesty.
I don't believe that you didn't have carnal knowledge of the Queen after her marriage to the King.
Please don't!
It is the truth- because someone else had succeeded me in her affections.
Who?
WHO?
Thomas Culpepper.
Thomas Culpepper?
The King's groom?
Yes, sir.
How well did you know this man, Thomas Culpepper?
Quite well.
I flirted with him and met him sometimes by the back stairs, and gave him gifts.
He called me his " sweet little fool."
And did you commit adultery with him?
No, my Lord.
I never did- although Lady Rochford encouraged me to do so.
Lady Rochford encouraged you?
Yes, she did.
And then she spread a vile rumour that we were lovers, which we never were.
You don't deny that you met with the Queen in secret on many occasions?
No, my Lord.
But you deny that you ever committed adultery with her?
I do.
We never passed beyond words.
If you don't tell me the truth, Mr. Culpepper, you will be tortured till you do.
I'm telling you the truth.
Which isn't to say I didn't want to go further!
I intended and meant to do so with the Queen, and she with me.
My God.
That evil intent in itself constitutes high treason.
But it was Katherine who led me on!
She wanted it, not me.
And her servant, Lady Rochford, she provoked it and acted as a procuress, like some madam in a brothel!
Why are they blaming me?
It's not my fault.
I had to stand guard when they met in the Queen's chambers, or even her stool closet.
I didn't want to.
I didn't like doing it.
Once I even had to stop the King coming into the Queen's bedchamber, because Culpepper was already there.
Do you think they had carnal knowledge at those times?
I cannot think it otherwise, considering all the things I heard and saw between them.
Guard!
Do you think I shall die, my Lord?
Do you think I shall die?
Constable!
Open up!
Your Majesty asked me at the beginning of this investigation not to desist until I had got to the bottom of the pot.
Majesty, I fear to say that I am already scraping the bottom, and a good companion of Your Majesty, a fellow of trust, seems certain to have betrayed Your Majesty- committing adultery with the Queen, your wife.

Well done, wife.
What shall we call him?
Thomas.
Very well.
Thomas he is.
You want to ask Lady Rochford some more questions?
- Yes.
- There's no point, Sir Thomas.
Lady Rochford has gone mad.
Death to you!
There you are.
Majesty?
His Grace, the Duke of Suffolk.
You've never read the Bible, have you, Charles?
No, Your Majesty.
I've always allowed others, with more knowledge than I, to read it for me.

virtue, and honour,

"and wisely, temperately, like myself,

It's time, my Lady.
I have come here to die.
Oh, my Lady!
I die a Queen.
But I would rather die the wife of Culpepper...
Life is very beautiful.
Previously on The Tudors...
Allow me to introduce my wife, Queen Katherine.
It seems incredible to have obtained such a perfect jewel of womanhood who bears towards me such perfect love.
I urge Your Majesty to be careful.
What, Lady Rochford?
Don't you think I know how to meddle with a man?
You hate my brother.
If only you could be more like him, Sir Thomas.
My husband always takes what he wants.
It's him.
It is him, isn't it?
Mr. Francis Dereham.
Surely you can understand why I cannot offer you anything.
- But you employed Joan Bulmer.
- I can't!
Oh, but you can.
Your Majesty.
Her name is Katherine Howard, and I've known her a long time.
We used to be very close.
Very close.
Today I appointed a new usher to my chambers.
You don't mind?
Of course not.
I told you, you must do as you will.
Madam, your good health.
I must see him.
Who, Your Majesty?
- Culpepper.
- My lady.
Tell him to come when the King is asleep.
This Dereham, you have to get rid of him.
I will, I promise.
I told you, I love you.
You must not be so familiar with the Queen of England.
The King ought to know how beggardely his wife's servants treat her.
Damn you Fell!
Damn you!
His Majesty wishes to thank God for blessing him with so perfect a companion as Queen Katherine.
I render thanks to Thee, oh Lord-
Thou hast been pleased to give me a wife as her I now have.
What does this letter say?
I thought Your Majesty just read-
I asked you to tell me what this letter says, my Lord Hertford.
The letter accuses Queen Katherine of dissolute living before she was married to Your Majesty, while she was living with the Dowager Duchess of Norfolk.
There was two men.
A music teacher named Henry Manox, and a gentleman called Francis Dereham.
And that her way of life was not a secret, that many knew of it.
Who wrote the letter?
It is not signed.
Whoever left the letter says he only wrote it because he did not have the heart to tell you by mouth.
It's a forgery!
Yes, Your Majesty.
The accusations in this letter are maliciously intended.
Many calumnies are published about well-known persons, are they not?
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- Nevertheless, my Lord,
I charge you to investigate the matter thoroughly.
Do not desist until you have reached to the bottom of the pot.
- Majesty.
- In the meantime, the Queen shall be confined to her apartments, with only Lady Rochford in attendance- until her name is cleared.
My Lord.
Majesty.
Your Majesty.
No, the other hand.
What?
Sergeant?
What is this?
My Lady, you are confined to your apartments, with only Lady Rochford to attend you, for as long as it please the King.
- No!
- Please, Katherine!
- Joan!
- Don't let them take me!
Joan!
Joan!
Why?
Why must I stay here?
Please tell me.
I don't understand.
Forgive me, my Lady.
But from now on there will be a guard posted just beyond the door.
Please.
Francis Dereham, you are under arrest.
Under arrest for what?
For what, I ask you?
I want to ask you some questions about what went on, some years ago, at Lambeth, between Katherine Howard, as she then was, and two men:
Henry Manox and Francis Dereham.
You know what I'm talking about, don't you?
There's no need to be afraid, Mistress Bulmer.
No harm will come to you- so long as you tell me the truth!
Is that clear?
Yes, sir.
I understand that this man,
Henry Manox, was a music teacher?
Did you ever see him or hear of him taking liberties with Katherine Howard?
Yes, sir.
He told me he was in love with her.
I told him,
I said if my lady of Norfolk knew of the love between him and Mistress Howard, she would undo him, because she is from a noble house, and if you marry her, some of her blood will kill you.
And what did Manox say?
He said, "Hold your peace, woman!
My designs are
"of a dishonest kind.
I doubt not I shall achieve my purpose."
She said to him that he would have her maidenhead, though it be painful to her, knowing he'd be good to her afterwards.
And did he-have her maidenhead?
No, sir, for she started seeing someone else.
And would that man be Francis Dereham?
Yes, my Lord.
Did you know Katherine Howard at Lambeth, when she was 14 or 15 years old?
Yes, sir.
Did you have carnal knowledge of her?
We-played some games.
We pretended to be man and wife.
It amused her.
Did you know her carnally?
You should know, Mr. Dereham, that we have spoken to some of the maids who used to sleep in the same dormitory.
They say that you crept into the Queen's bed for a hundred nights or more.
She was not the Queen.
Let me ask again.
Did you have carnal knowledge of Katherine Howard?
No!
I thought you were not altogether honest with me, Mr. Dereham.
I wanted to show you what we do to people who are dishonest.
Who don't tell the truth.
I'll tell you the truth.
Certain accusations have been made against the Queen.
What kind of accusations?
Oh, that she was light, immoral, dissolute...
With certain men...
Before she came to court.
I can't believe it to be true.
But since the accusations are made,
I must know all the facts.
But since this inquisition is in progress, be careful who you speak to.
I'll have no spark of scandal against her name.
Yes, Your Majesty.
I have a good hand.
What do they know?
Why have I been confined like this?
I don't know.
Someone has told them something!
Who?
What has he told them?
What has he told them?
Why are you crying like this?
It's not about you!
I have to speak to him.
I have to speak to the King.
He'll understand.
We have some evidence that Katherine Howard gave you a gold chain and rich cap, as a gift.
Why did she buy you such gifts?
Because she loved me.
Loved you?
Yes, my Lord.
She told me: "I promise you
"I do love you with all my heart."
She promised by her faith and troth that she would take no other husband but me.
You were pre-contracted then?
Yes, sir.
It was understood between us that we would get married.
That's why...
That's why you knew her carnally?
Yes, sir.
We didn't think we were doing anything wrong.
She was going to be my wife and I her husband.
We'd made promises before God.
Why did you not marry her, then?
I left Lambeth for a while and went to Ireland.
When I returned, Katherine was already at court.
The Queen recently took you back into her employment.
On what grounds?
The Dowager Duchess was kind enough to speak highly of my talents.
You have admitted to the fact that you had carnal knowledge of the Queen before her marriage to the King.
But did you also know her carnally afterwards?
No, sir!
No!
On my honour!
On your honour, Mr. Dereham?
My Lady?
His Excellency is here.
Eustace!
Please, sit.
Thank you, Lady Mary.
You are too gracious.
I had to see you.
There are many rumours at court.
And it seems the Queen has been confined to her apartments.
Why?
Nobody knows.
But the rumours speak of her misconduct.
I knew it.
I knew she was always a light young woman, dedicated only to pleasure.
And the sad fact is, Lady Mary, that the Howards are a great Catholic family.
No, Eustace, the sad fact is that Katherine Howard was never a good Catholic, nor ever a good wife.
Nor even less a Queen!
What have you discovered?
Katherine Howard was a loose young woman.
You surely knew that!
I was told that her upbringing had been unconventional.
I didn't know how unconventional.
I didn't suspect that at fourteen years old she was sleeping with two older men!
You met her!
You saw the look in her eyes.
She was never innocent.
And who is innocent, my sweetheart?
What did Dereham confess?
Only that he'd slept with the Queen before she was married.
Do you believe him?
I don't know.
I may ask again.
Husband, you must be careful.
If you remember, you were among those who offered Katherine Howard up to the King.
Do you suppose I ever forget that?
But that's why I must be harder on her than anyone else.
Since I was the most deceived.
I must to bed.
I have things to do in the morning.
I bid thee, all three of thee, good night.
Good night, brother.
So...
What shall we call your child, Thomas?
Sir Edward- can you not tell me what's happening?
I beg you.
No one tells me anything.
Please... please...
- Madam, I am forbidden to talk to you.
No, no.
You must speak to me.
Madam, I can't...
On my life!
Just something!
Why am I confined here?
What has anyone said?
They have taken Dereham to the Tower.
Also some of the maids who attended the Dowager Duchess.
Oh... my God.
That's all I know.
Now, Madam, you will have to excuse me.
I can say no more.
His Majesty the King.
Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.
Your Grace?
Your Majesty, my Lord Hertford, and other Councillors, have made diligent inquiries into the question of the misconduct of the Queen.
And?
Your Majesty-
I have to tell Your Majesty that, even from my preliminary investigations, we believe the allegations against Queen Katherine have a sound basis in fact...
The Queen received the attentions of her music master,
Henry Manox, when she lived with the Dowager Duchess of Norfolk.
Manox swears under oath that she never gave him her maidenhead...
But that instead it was given to a man called Francis Dereham.
There is ample proof that they spent many nights together...
Naked.
Dereham claims that he was pre-contracted to the Queen, so he did no wrong by having carnal relations with her, and that their relationship was over when he left for Ireland and the Queen for Your Majesty's court.
Unfortunately...
Queen Katherine took this same Dereham back into her employment during Your Majesty's late progress, appointing him her personal secretary and usher.
I have to say that she has betrayed you in thought- and if she had an opportunity- would have betrayed you in deed.
My Lady.
Sir Thomas?
What is it?
Madam, I have come to tell you that for your offences against the King, all your household has been discharged.
Your coffers and chests will be sealed and placed under guard, and I am also come here to collect all your jewels and return them to His Majesty.
Please, Sir Thomas- Everything in here is where is the King?
I must see him.
Madam, I must tell you that the King and his Council have ordained that, for your offences, you have forfeited the title of Queen, and must be known as Lady Katherine Howard.
You will be taken to Syon Abbey today, to wait upon the King's further pleasure.
Where is the King?
I need to speak to him.
You don't understand.
I have to speak to him.
Then everything will be all right.
Don't you understand?
Everything will be all right.
His Majesty is at Chapel.
But I fear he will not speak to you.
Lady Katherine!
Stop her!
Guards!
Katherine Howard!
Stop!
Katherine Howard!
Stop!
You are arrested.
Stop!
Do not proceed!
Katherine Howard!
- Your Majesty!
I must speak to you.
Please, please, Your Majesty!
Please, it's me-Katherine!
It's Katherine.
It's Katherine.
Please.
Please.
Henry!
Henry, please!
No!
Your Majesty!
No, please!
Henry!
No, please!
Please, Henry!
Please!
Risley.
Risley!
Majesty.
Go and fetch Bishop Gardiner.
I must speak to him.
Yes, Your Majesty.
Why are you doing this?
Why are you doing this?
I've already told you everything I know!
His hands, my loves.
His hands.
What are you going to do to me?
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
NO!
Your Grace.
I must warn Your Grace that the poor creature, ever since she came here, has been in such lamentation and heaviness that I never saw in any creature.
Sometimes in a frenzy, that I had to remove every implement that might have harmed her.
Lady Katherine!
Lady Katherine!
Bishop Gardiner is come to see you.
Lady Katherine?
Lady Katherine, do not weep, for I am come here with a letter from His Majesty which offers you his most gracious mercy.
Madam, the King offers you mercy.
What?
What did you say?
Here is His Majesty's letter.
In it, he offers you mercy, despite the- uh-grievous offences you have committed against him, if you will only openly confess your faults.
There.
You see?
I humbly thank the King, who has shown me more grace and mercy than I could have hoped for.
But, first, I must ask you some questions.
And you must answer as truthfully and honestly as you will reply at the Day of Judgment.
Katherine!
The King offers his hand in mercy.
There is nothing to be frightened of.
Come.
Come!
Sit down.
Alas, my Lord, that I am alive!
The fear of death does not grieve me as much as the remembrance of the King's goodness,
for when I remember how gracious and loving a Prince
I had, I cannot but sorrow.
But this sudden mercy, more than I could have looked for, makes my offences appear to my eyes more heinous than they did before.
You confess that this Francis Dereham came often to your bed at Lambeth?
Yes, my Lord.
He has lain with me, sometimes in his doublet and hose, and sometimes naked, but I mean, not so naked that he had nothing upon him, for he had always his doublet on; but I mean
naked when his hose was pulled down.
In order to know you carnally?
Was there a pre-contract between you?
Did you intend to marry him?
He sometimes called me "wife" when we were together, and I called him "husband."
Still-I think it was no contract.
If there was a contract, then your marriage to the King would be invalid- you might face shame...
But you would not forfeit your life.
He promised to love me with all his heart...
But I think it was no contract.
Did Dereham have carnal knowledge of you after you became Queen?
No, my Lord.
He never did.
I will go back to London and draft a plea of forgiveness for you to submit to the King.
Wait!
I have important things to say.
My Lady?
I never consented to sex with Francis Dereham.
He used importunate force against me.
In a manner-violence.
He raped you?
The Queen confessed?
Yes.
She told me that Dereham raped her.
I'm sure she was lying as
I'm sure she's lying about other things too.
But I do believe that there was some form of pre-contract between them, which would invalidate the marriage.
And she claims to be innocent after the marriage?
Of course.
And you believed that?
You don't believe it?
I don't believe anything Dereham says.
It might not be Dereham.
Why does Your Grace say that?
You have the Queen's confession?
Yes, Your Majesty.
The Queen begs for mercy.
She confesses that she was so desirous to be taken into Your Grace's favour, so blinded by desire for worldly glory, that she did not consider how great a fault it was to conceal her former faults from Your Majesty.
"Considering that I intended
"ever during my life
"to be faithful and true to Your Majesty."
Then we can proceed with the annulment?
I think it would be best, Your Majesty.
I don't believe that you didn't have carnal knowledge of the Queen after her marriage to the King.
Please don't!
It is the truth- because someone else had succeeded me in her affections.
Who?
WHO?
Thomas Culpepper.
Thomas Culpepper?
The King's groom?
Yes, sir.
How well did you know this man, Thomas Culpepper?
Quite well.
I flirted with him and met him sometimes by the back stairs, and gave him gifts.
He called me his " sweet little fool."
And did you commit adultery with him?
No, my Lord.
I never did- although Lady Rochford encouraged me to do so.
Lady Rochford encouraged you?
Yes, she did.
And then she spread a vile rumour that we were lovers, which we never were.
You don't deny that you met with the Queen in secret on many occasions?
No, my Lord.
But you deny that you ever committed adultery with her?
I do.
We never passed beyond words.
If you don't tell me the truth, Mr. Culpepper, you will be tortured till you do.
I'm telling you the truth.
Which isn't to say I didn't want to go further!
I intended and meant to do so with the Queen, and she with me.
My God.
That evil intent in itself constitutes high treason.
But it was Katherine who led me on!
She wanted it, not me.
And her servant, Lady Rochford, she provoked it and acted as a procuress, like some madam in a brothel!
Why are they blaming me?
It's not my fault.
I had to stand guard when they met in the Queen's chambers, or even her stool closet.
I didn't want to.
I didn't like doing it.
Once I even had to stop the King coming into the Queen's bedchamber, because Culpepper was already there.
Do you think they had carnal knowledge at those times?
I cannot think it otherwise, considering all the things I heard and saw between them.
Guard!
Do you think I shall die, my Lord?
Do you think I shall die?
Constable!
Open up!
Your Majesty asked me at the beginning of this investigation not to desist until I had got to the bottom of the pot.
Majesty, I fear to say that I am already scraping the bottom, and a good companion of Your Majesty, a fellow of trust, seems certain to have betrayed Your Majesty- committing adultery with the Queen, your wife.
Who is he?
Your groom, Thomas Culpepper.
So far, both of them have denied the charges, though neither of them denies the many illicit meetings they had on the backstairs and in the Queen's stool closet during Your Majesty's last progress.
Lady Rochford and other maids of Her Majesty have come forward with corroborating evidence of their frequent intimacies.
Finally, this letter was discovered in Mr. Culpepper's chambers.
It is the Queen's handwriting.
She writes:
"It makes my heart die to think
"I cannot always be in your company."
And, "I heard that you were sick and never longed so much for anything as to see you."
And it is signed:
"Yours as long as life endures
"
-Katherine."
What has happened is your fault!
Your fault!
You solicited me to marry her!
How misfortunate I am to have had so many ill-conditioned wives!
I vow that any pleasure that wicked bitch got from her wantonness will be nothing-nothing- in comparison to the pain she going to feel at the hand of my torturer!
Well done, wife.
What shall we call him?
Thomas.
Very well.
Thomas he is.
You want to ask Lady Rochford some more questions?
- Yes.
- There's no point, Sir Thomas.
Lady Rochford has gone mad.
Death to you!
There you are.
Majesty?
His Grace, the Duke of Suffolk.
You've never read the Bible, have you, Charles?
No, Your Majesty.
I've always allowed others, with more knowledge than I, to read it for me.
In that case, you've missed many great sayings and truths,
Like this one here in the Book of Solomon, where it says:
"The lips of a harlot are "a dropping honeycomb.
"Her throat is softer than oil.
"Yet in the end,
"she is as bitter as wormwood, and as sharp as a double-edged sword."
Why have you come?
King Francis has sent you a letter.
What does it say?
"I am sorry to hear of the displeasure and trouble which has been caused "by the lewd and naughty behaviour of the Queen.
"But knowing my good brother to be a prince of prudence,"
virtue, and honour,
"I do require him to throw off the said displeasure
"and wisely, temperately, like myself,
"not reputing his honour to rest in the lightness of a woman,
"but to thank God of all,
"comforting himself in God's goodness.
"The lightness of women cannot bend the honour of men."
You tell Francis to go-
Tell His Majesty that we are grateful for his solicitations.
Yes, Your Majesty.
What of Dereham and Culpepper?
Have they been arraigned for treason?
They were tried together.
At the last moment, Culpepper changed his plea to guilty, but both were found so.
They are due to be hanged, drawn and quartered together at Tyburn.
Tell the judge to commute Culpepper's sentencing to beheading.
I hate Dereham more, since he spoiled the Queen for me.
Now, what of Lady Rochford?
She has been found guilty of misprision and treason- but, since she is insane, she cannot be executed.
You tell Richard Rich to pass a bill in Parliament making it legal to execute an insane person for treason.
Do you hear?
Yes, Your Majesty.
You were one of those who placed Katherine Howard in front of me.
Were you not, your Grace?
Any regrets?
Charles.
Majesty.
You should be ashamed of yourselves!
Traitor!
"Master Culpepper,
"I heartily recommend me unto you,
"praying you to send me word how that you do.
"I heard that you were sick,
"and never longed so much for anything as to see you.
"I would you were with me now that you might see
"what pain I take in writing to you.
"It makes my heart die to think
"I cannot always be in your company."
I beg you all to pray for me.
"He, Dereham,
"gave me lots of lovers' tokens.
"He knew a little woman in London with a crooked back,
"who was skilled in making flowers of silk,
"who made for him a French fennel to give to me.
"And later, a heart's ease for a New Year's present,
"and some sarcenet, which I had made into a quilted cap.
"He called me "wife,"
"and touched the secret parts of my body.
"I remember I gave him a collar and sleeves for a shirt.
"And one day,
"he snatched a silver bracelet from me and kept it,
"saying, 'Here, wife, "'a gift for me.'
"And he kissed me often and so passionately
"that everyone said he would never have kissed me enough."
No!
No!
Katherine Howard, you are indicted for having led an abominable, base, carnal, voluptuous, and vicious life before marriage like a common harlot- with several persons.
You led the King by word and gesture to love you, concealing your contract with Francis Dereham to the peril of the King and his children begotten by you.
And after marriage, you showed the same Dereham notable favour, while inciting Thomas Culpepper to carnal knowledge, telling him you loved him above the King.
It is my duty to escort you to the Tower.
My Lady.
Sir Edward.
Don't let them.
No.
Thomas?
Oh God!
Oh, Thomas!
- My Lady.
- No, no, no, no!
No, no!
No, No!
No, Thomas!
Is she condemned?
Yes, Your Majesty.
What of the others?
Dereham and Culpepper have been executed and the bill allowing a mad person to be executed for treason has become law.
I want to have a party.
Here is a list of guests.
Yes, Your Majesty.
Katherine Howard, I have to tell you that you are going to die.
You will be taken to your place of execution tomorrow morning, the 13th of February, escorted by members of the Privy Council.
May I ask one favour?
Will you bring the block to me- so that I might know how to place myself and... make trial of it?
As you wish.
Is there anything else you need?
Do you want a confessor?
No.
I have spoken to God so rarely,
I did not think He would know who I was.
Ladies.
Something sweet?
What do you think?
- Your Majesty.
Ah!
A beautiful Queen.
Madam.
- Do you want to say a few words?
I ask forgiveness for my sins, from His Gracious Majesty,
from God, and from all of you.
Shall I say more?
No, my Lady.
That is already sufficient.
Thank you.
It's time, my Lady.
I have come here to die.
Oh, my Lady!
I die a Queen.
But I would rather die the wife of Culpepper...
Life is very beautiful.
Previously on The Tudors...
Allow me to introduce my wife, Queen Katherine.
It seems incredible to have obtained such a perfect jewel of womanhood who bears towards me such perfect love.
I urge Your Majesty to be careful.
What, Lady Rochford?
Don't you think I know how to meddle with a man?
You hate my brother.
If only you could be more like him, Sir Thomas.
My husband always takes what he wants.
It is him, isn't it?
Surely you can understand why I cannot offer you anything.
- But you employed Joan Bulmer.
- I can't!
But you can, Your Majesty.
Her name is Katherine Howard, and I've known her a long time.
We used to be very close.
Very close.
Today I appointed a new usher to my chambers.
- You don't mind?
- Of course not.
You must do as you will.
Madam, your good health.
I must see him.
Who, Your Majesty?
- Culpepper.
- My lady.
Tell him to come when the King is asleep.
This Dereham, you have to get rid of him.
I will, I promise.
I told you, I love you.
You must not be so familiar with the Queen of England.
The King ought to know how beggarly his wife's servants treat her.
Damn you Fell!
Damn you!
His Majesty wishes to thank God for blessing him with so perfect a companion as Queen Katherine.
I render thanks to Thee, oh Lord.
You hast been pleased to give me a wife as her I now have.

- What does this letter say?
- I thought Your Majesty just read...
I asked you to tell me what this letter says, My Lord Hertford.
The letter accuses Queen Katherine of dissolute living before she was married to Your Majesty, while she was living with the Dowager Duchess of Norfolk.
There was two men.
A music teacher named Henry Manox, and a gentleman called Francis Dereham.
And that her way of life was not a secret, that many knew of it.
Who wrote the letter?
It is not signed.
Whoever left it says he only wrote it because he did not have the heart to tell you by mouth.
- It's a forgery!
- Yes, Your Majesty.
The accusations in this letter are maliciously intended.
Many calumnies are published about well-known persons.
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- Nevertheless,
I charge you to investigate the matter thoroughly.
Do not desist until you have reached to the bottom of the pot.
The Queen shall be confined to her apartments, with only Lady Rochford in attendance, until her name is cleared.
My Lord.
Majesty.
Your Majesty.
No, the other hand.
What?
Sergeant?
What is this?
My Lady, you are confined to your apartments, with only Lady Rochford to attend you, for as long as it please the King.
Please, Katherine, don't let them take me!
Joan!
Joan!
Why?
Why must I stay here?
Please tell me.
I don't understand.
Forgive me, but from now on, there will be a guard posted beyond the door.
Please.
Francis Dereham, you are under arrest.
Under arrest for what?
For what, I ask you?
I want to ask you some questions about what went on some years ago at Lambeth,
between Katherine Howard, as she then was, and two men,
Henry Manox... and Francis Dereham.
You know what I'm talking about, don't you?
There's no need to be afraid, Mistress Bulmer.
No harm will come to you, so long as you tell me the truth!
Is that clear?
Yes, sir.
I understand that this man, Henry Manox, was a music teacher.
Did you ever see him or... hear of him taking liberties with Katherine Howard?
Yes, sir.
He told me he was in love with her.
But I told him,
I said if my lady knew of the love between him and Mistress Howard, she would undo him, because... she is from a noble house, and if you marry her, some of her blood will kill you.
And what did Manox say?
He said, "Hold your peace, woman!"
"My designs are of a dishonest kind."
"I doubt not I shall achieve my purpose."
She said to him that he would have her maidenhead, though it be painful to her, knowing he'd be good to her afterwards.
And did he... have her maidenhead?
No, sir, for she started seeing someone else.
And would that man be Francis Dereham?
Yes, my Lord.
Did you know Katherine Howard at Lambeth, when she was 14 or 15 years old?
Yes, sir.
Did you have carnal knowledge of her?
We... played some games.
We pretended to be man and wife.
It amused her.
Did you know her carnally?
You should know, Mr. Dereham, that we have spoken to some of the maids who used to sleep in the same dormitory.
They say that you crept into the Queen's bed for a hundred nights.
- She was not the Queen.
- Let me ask again.
Did you have carnal knowledge of Katherine Howard?
No!
I thought you were not altogether honest with me, Mr. Dereham.
I wanted to show you what we do to people who are dishonest, who don't tell the truth.
I'll tell you the truth.
Certain accusations have been made against the Queen.
What kind of accusations?
That she was light, immoral, dissolute... with certain men... before she came to court.
I can't believe it to be true.
But since the accusations are made, I must know all the facts.
But since this inquisition is in progress, be careful who you speak to.
I'll have no spark of scandal against her name.
Yes, Your Majesty.
I have a good hand.
What do they know?
Why have I been confined like this?
I don't know.
Someone has told them something!
Who?
What has he told them?
What has he told them?
Why are you crying like this?
It's not about you!
I have to speak to him.
I have to speak to the King.
He'll understand.
We have some evidence that Katherine Howard gave you a gold chain and rich cap as a gift.
Why did she buy you such gifts?
Because she loved me.
Loved you?
Yes, my Lord.
She told me: "I promise you I do love you with all my heart."
She promised by her faith and troth that she would take no other husband but me.
You were pre-contracted then?
Yes, sir.
It was understood between us that we would get married.
That's why...
That's why you knew her carnally?
Yes, sir.
We weren't doing anything wrong.
She was going to be my wife and I her husband.
We'd made promises before God.
Why did you not marry her, then?
I left Lambeth for a while and went to Ireland.
When I returned, Katherine was already at court.
The Queen recently took you back into her employment.
On what grounds?
The Dowager Duchess was kind enough to speak highly of my talents.
You have admitted to the fact that you had carnal knowledge of the Queen before her marriage to the King.
But did you also know her carnally afterwards?
No, sir!
No!
On my honour!
On your honour, Mr. Dereham?
My Lady?
His Excellency is here.
Eustace!
Please, sit.
Thank you, Lady Mary.
You are too gracious.
I had to see you.
There are many rumours at court.
And it seems the Queen has been confined to her apartments.
- Why?
- Nobody knows.
But the rumours speak of her misconduct.
I knew it.
I knew she was always a light young woman, dedicated only to pleasure.
And the sad fact is, Lady Mary, that the Howards are a great Catholic family.
No, the sad fact is that Katherine Howard was never a good Catholic, nor ever a good wife.
Nor even less a Queen!
What have you discovered?
Katherine Howard was a loose young woman.
You surely knew that!
I was told that her upbringing had been unconventional.
I didn't know how unconventional.
I didn't suspect that at 14 years old she was sleeping with two older men!
You met her!
You saw the look in her eyes.
She was never innocent.
And who is innocent, my sweetheart?
What did Dereham confess?
Only that he'd slept with the Queen before she was married.
Do you believe him?
I don't know.
I may ask again.
Husband, you must be careful.
If you remember, you were among those who offered Katherine up to the King.
Do you suppose I ever forget that?
But that's why I must be harder on her than anyone else.
Since I was the most deceived.
I must to bed.
I have things to do in the morning.
I bid thee, all three of thee, good night.
Good night, brother.
So...
What shall we call your child, Thomas?
Sir Edward, can you not tell me what's happening?
I beg you, no one tells me anything.
Please, please.
Madam, I am forbidden to talk to you.
No, no.
You must speak to me.
- Madam, I can't.
On my life!
- Just something!
Why am I confined here?
What has anyone said?
They have taken Dereham to the Tower.
Also some of the maids who attended the Dowager Duchess.
My God.
That's all I know.
Madam, you will have to excuse me.
I can say no more.
His Majesty the King.
Your Majesty.
Your Grace?
Your Majesty, my Lord Hertford, and other Councillors,
have made diligent inquiries into the question of the... misconduct of the Queen.
And?
Your Majesty-
I have to tell Your Majesty that even from my preliminary investigations, we believe the allegations against Queen Katherine have a sound basis in fact...
The Queen received the attentions of her music master, Henry Manox when she lived with the Dowager Duchess of Norfolk.
Manox swears under oath that she never gave him her maidenhead.
But that instead it was given to a man called Francis Dereham.
There is ample proof that they spent many nights together... naked.
Dereham claims that he was pre-contracted to the Queen, so he did no wrong by having carnal relations with her, and that their relationship was over when he left for Ireland and the Queen for Your Majesty's court.
Unfortunately...
Queen Katherine took this same Dereham back into her employment during Your Majesty's late progress,
appointing him her personal secretary and usher.
I have to say that she has betrayed you in thought, and if she had an opportunity, would have betrayed you in deed.
My Lady.
Sir Thomas?
What is it?
Madam,
I have come to tell you that, for your offences against the King, all your household has been discharged.
Your coffers and chests will be sealed and placed under guard, and I am also come here to collect all your jewels and return them to His Majesty.
Please, sir Thomas, where is the King?
I must see him.
Madam, I must tell you that the King and his Council have ordained that, for your offences, you have forfeited the title of Queen, and must be known as Lady Katherine Howard.
You will be taken to Syon Abbey today, to wait upon the King's further pleasure.
Where is the King?
I need to speak to him.
You don't understand.
I have to speak to him.
Then everything will be all right.
Don't you understand?
Everything will be all right.
His Majesty is at Chapel.
But I fear he will not speak to you.
Lady Katherine!
Stop her!
Guards!
Katherine Howard!
Stop her!
Katherine Howard!
Stop!
You are arrested.
Stop!
Do not proceed, Katherine Howard!
Your Majesty!
I must speak to you.
Please.
Please, Your Majesty!
Please, it's me, Katherine!
It's Katherine.
It's Katherine.
Please.
Please.
Henry!
Henry, please!
No!
Your Majesty!
No, please!
Henry!
No, please!
Please, Henry!
Risley.
Risley!
Majesty.
Go and fetch Bishop Gardiner.
- I must speak to him.
- Yes, Your Majesty.
Why are you doing this?
Why are you doing this?
I've already told you everything I know!
His hands, my loves.
His hands.
What are you going to do to me?
No!
No!
Your Grace.
I must warn Your Grace- that the poor creature, ever since she came here, has been in such lamentation and heaviness that I never saw in any creature.
Sometimes in a frenzy, that I had to remove every implement that might have harmed her.
Lady Katherine!
Lady Katherine!
Bishop Gardiner is come to see you.
Lady Katherine, do not weep, for I am come here with a letter from His Majesty which offers you his most gracious mercy.
Madam, the King offers you mercy.
What?
What did you say?
Here is His Majesty's letter.
In it, he offers you mercy, despite the... the grievous offences you have committed against him, if you will only openly confess your faults.
There.
You see?
I humbly thank the King, who has shown me more grace and mercy than I could have hoped for.
But, first, I must ask you some questions.
And you must answer as truthfully and honestly as you will reply at the Day of Judgment.
Katherine!
The King offers his hand in mercy.
There is nothing to be frightened of.
Come!
Sit down.
Alas,
My Lord, that I am alive!
The fear of death does not grieve me as much as the remembrance of the King's goodness,
for when I remember how gracious and loving a Prince
I had, I cannot but sorrow.
But this sudden mercy, more than I could have looked for, makes my offences appear to my eyes more heinous than they did before.
You confess that this Francis Dereham came often to your bed at Lambeth?
Yes, my Lord.
He has lain with me, sometimes in his doublet and hose, and sometimes naked, but I mean, not so naked that he had nothing upon him, for he had always his doublet on; but I mean
naked when his hose was pulled down.
In order to know you carnally?
Was there a pre-contract between you?
Did you intend to marry him?
He sometimes called me "wife" when we were together, and I called him "husband."
It was no contract.
If there was a contract, then your marriage to the King would be invalid, you might face shame...
But you would not forfeit your life.
He promised to love me with all his heart.
I think it was no contract.
Did Dereham have carnal knowledge of you after you became Queen?
No, my Lord.
He never did.
I'll go back to London and draft a plea of forgiveness for you to submit to the King.
Wait!
I have important things to say.
My Lady?
I never consented to sex with Francis Dereham.
He used importunate force against me.
In a manner... violence.
He raped you?
The Queen confessed?
Yes.
She told me that Dereham raped her.
I'm sure she was lying as and about other things too.
But I do believe that there was some form of pre-contract between them, which would invalidate the marriage.
She claims to be innocent after the marriage?
Of course.
- And you believed that?
- You don't believe it?
I don't believe anything Dereham says.
It might not be Dereham.
Why does Your Grace say that?
You have the Queen's confession?
Yes, Your Majesty.
The Queen begs for mercy.
She confesses that she was so desirous to be taken into Your Grace's favour, so blinded by desire for worldly glory, that she did not consider how great a fault it was to conceal her former faults from Your Majesty.
"Considering that I intended
"ever during my life
"to be faithful and true to Your Majesty."
- We can proceed with the annulment?
- I think it would be best.
I don't believe that you didn't have carnal knowledge of the Queen after her marriage.
Please don't!
It is the truth!
Because someone else had succeeded me in her affections.
Who?
Thomas Culpepper.
Thomas Culpepper?
The King's groom?
Yes, sir.
How well did you know this man, Thomas Culpepper?
Quite well.
I flirted with him met him by the back stairs, and gave him gifts.
He called me his " sweet little fool."
And did you commit adultery with him?
No, My Lord.
I never did although...
Lady Rochford encouraged me to do so.
Lady Rochford encouraged you?
Yes, she did.
And then she spread a vile rumour that we were lovers, which we never were.
You don't deny that you met with the Queen
- in secret on many occasions?
- No, My Lord.
But you deny that you ever committed adultery with her?
I do.
We never passed beyond words.
If you don't tell me the truth, Mr. Culpepper, you will be tortured till you do.
I'm telling you the truth.
Which isn't to say I didn't want to go further!
I intended and meant to do so with the Queen, and she with me.
My God.
That evil intent in itself constitutes high treason.
But it was...
Katherine who led me on!
She wanted it, not me.
And her servant, Lady Rochford, she provoked it and acted as a procuress, like some madam in a brothel!
Why are they blaming me?
It's not my fault.
I had to stand guard when they met in the Queen's chambers, or even her stool closet.
I didn't want to.
I didn't like doing it.
Once I even had to stop the King coming into the Queen's bedchamber, because Culpepper was already there.
Do you think they had carnal knowledge at those times?
I cannot think it otherwise, considering all the things I heard and saw between them.
Guard!
Do you think I shall die, my Lord?
Do you think I shall die?
Constable!
Open up!
Your Majesty asked me at the beginning not to desist until I had got to the bottom of the pot.
Majesty, I fear to say that I am already scraping the bottom, and a good companion of Your Majesty, a fellow of trust, seems certain to have betrayed Your Majesty
committing adultery with the Queen.
Who is he?
Your groom, Thomas Culpepper.
So far, both of them have denied the charges, though neither of them denies the illicit meetings they had on the backstairs and in the Queen's stool closet during Your Majesty's last progress.
Lady Rochford and other maids of Her Majesty have come forward with corroborating evidence of their frequent intimacies.
This letter was discovered in Mr. Culpepper's chambers.
It is the Queen's handwriting.
She writes:
"It makes my heart die to think
"I cannot always be in your company."
"I heard that you were sick and longed so much to see you."
And it is signed:
"Yours as long as life endures
"Katherine."
What has happened is your fault!
Your fault!
You solicited me to marry her!
How misfortunate I am to have had so many ill-conditioned wives!
I vow that any pleasure that wicked bitch got from her wantonness will be nothing, nothing in comparison to the pain she going to feel at the hand of my torturer!
Well done, wife.
What shall we call him?
Thomas.
Very well.
Thomas he is.
You want to ask Lady Rochford some more questions?
- Yes.
- There's no point, Sir Thomas.
Lady Rochford has gone mad.
Death to you!
There you are.
Majesty?
His Grace, the Duke of Suffolk.
You've never read the Bible, have you, Charles?
No, Your Majesty.
I've always allowed others, with more knowledge than I, to read it for me.
In that case, you've missed many great sayings and truths,
Like this one here in the Book of Solomon:
"The lips of a harlot are "a dropping honeycomb.
"Her throat is softer than oil.
"Yet in the end,
"she is as bitter as wormwood, and as sharp as a double-edged sword."
Why have you come?
King Francis has sent you a letter.
What does it say?
"I am sorry to hear of the displeasure and trouble which has been caused "by the lewd and naughty behavior of the Queen.
"But knowing my brother to be a prince of prudence and honor,
"I do require him to throw off the said displeasure
"and wisely, temperately, like myself,
"not reputing his honour to rest in the lightness of a woman,
"but to thank God of all, comforting himself in God's goodness.
"The lightness of women cannot bend the honour of men."
You tell Francis to go.
Tell His Majesty that we are grateful for his solicitations.
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- What of Dereham and Culpepper?
- They've been arraigned for treason?
- They were tried together.
At the last moment, Culpepper changed his plea to guilty, but both were found so.
They are due to be hanged, drawn and quartered together at Tyburn.
Tell the judge to commute Culpepper's sentencing to beheading.
I hate Dereham more, since he spoiled the Queen for me.
Now, what of Lady Rochford?
She has been found guilty of misprision and treason but, since she is insane, she cannot be executed.
You tell Richard Rich to pass a bill in Parliament making it legal to execute an insane person for treason.
Do you hear?
Yes, Your Majesty.
You were one of those who placed Katherine Howard in front of me.
Any regrets?
Charles.
Majesty.
You should be ashamed of yourselves!
Traitor!
"Master Culpepper,
"I heartily recommend me unto you,
"praying you to send me word how that you do.
"I heard that you were sick,
"and never longed so much for anything as to see you.
"I would you were with me now that you might see
"what pain I take in writing to you.
"It makes my heart die to think
"I cannot always be in your company."
I beg you all to pray for me.
"He, Dereham,
"gave me lots of lovers' tokens.
"He knew a little woman in London with a crooked back,
"who was skilled in making flowers of silk,
"who made for him a French fennel to give to me.
"And later, a heart's ease for a New Year's present,
"and some sarcenet, which I had made into a quilted cap.
"He called me "wife,"
"and touched the secret parts of my body.
"I remember I gave him a collar and sleeves for a shirt.
"And one day,
"he snatched a silver bracelet from me and kept it,
"saying,'Here, wife, a gift for me.'
"And he kissed me often and so passionately
"that everyone said he would never have kissed me enough."
Katherine Howard, you are indicted for having led an abominable, base, carnal, voluptuous, and vicious life before marriage like a common harlot- with several persons.
You led the King by word and gesture to love you, concealing your contract with Francis Dereham to the peril of the King and his children begotten by you.
And after marriage, you showed the same Dereham notable favour, while inciting Thomas Culpepper... to carnal knowledge, telling him
you loved him above the King.
It is my duty... to escort you to the Tower.
My Lady.
Sir Edward.
Don't let them.
No.
God!
- My Lady.
- No, no, no, no!
Is she condemned?
Yes, Your Majesty.
What of the others?
Dereham and Culpepper have been executed and the bill allowing a mad person to be executed for treason has become law.
I want to have a party.
- Here is a list of guests.
- Yes, Your Majesty.
Katherine Howard, I have to tell you that you are going to die.
You'll be taken tomorrow morning, the 13th of February, escorted by members of the Privy Council.
May I ask one favour?
Will you bring the block to me- so that I might know how to place myself and... make trial of it?
As you wish.
Is there anything else you need?
Do you want a confessor?
No.
I have spoken to God so rarely,
I did not think He would know who I was.
Ladies.
Something sweet?
What do you think?
Your Majesty.
A beautiful Queen.
Madam.
- Do you want to say a few words?
I... ask forgiveness for my sins,
from His Gracious Majesty, from God,
and from all of you.
Shall I say more?
No, my Lady.
That is already sufficient.
Thank you.
It's time, my Lady.
I have come here to die.
I die a Queen.
But I would rather die the wife of Culpepper...
Life is... very beautiful.

President.
I have something to tell you.
Shim Gun Wook...
No.
It's about "that" child.
I think it'd be wise to close the case on that matter now.
What do you mean by that?
Well...
To tell you the truth...
Hello.
It's me.
day by day, hurts you
I try my best to hide my tears, but
They're exposed when I stand in front of you
Even though I painfully push you away,
How have you been, Sir?
Tae Seong!
Tae Seong... you shouldn't.
You shouldn't meddle with Haeshin... nor Tae Ra!
You're right.
If I was the real Tae Seong, it's obvious that I would follow what you'd say.
But you said so yourself... that I'm not Tae Seong.
I'm Choi Tae Seong... wait...
or am I Shim Gun Wook?
You made it so that I couldn't even say my own real name.
Tae Seong...
Father!
Thank you for calling my name.
I wanted to see you.
I missed you.
You think I'd say things like that?
Don't fool yourself.
That's not it.
That's not it!
Don't say a word.
How I was brought into this house...
Why my parents ended up like that...
I've found out everything.
Just watch me.
It's too late.
Tae Seong.
Tae Seong.
I told you not to call me by that name.
Tae Seong...
Tae Seong...
President.
President.
President?
President!
- Please wake up.
- President!
- President!
- The president has collapsed!
- President.
President.
- Who collapsed?
President.
Honey.
Honey.
Honey.
Call the hospital, Section Chief Eun.
Honey.
Move.
Is this what you wanted?
Was it?
I'm asking if everything's going well, according to plan!
Get lost.
Honey.
Honey.
What should we do?
Huh?
Honey, wake up.
Honey.
Honey.
Honey, get up.
Honey, wake up.
All right?
Honey.
Tae Seong.
Father.
Shim Gun Wook.
Are you inside?
I heard Hong Tae Ra's getting a divorce.
Hey, Shim Gun Wook.
What are you trying to do here?
Hey.
Talk to me face to face.
Shim Gun Wook!
I'm telling you to open the door!
Father...
Why did Father collapse all of a sudden?
I told you to kick Shim Gun Wook out, didn't I?
Does Shim Gun Wook have something to do with Father collapsing?
The president called for Shim Gun Wook today.
The president collapsed while the two were having a conversation.
There were no witnesses, so who knows if that bastard strangled him or choked him with something?
What are you all talking about right now?
I'm asking why Father met with Shim Gun Wook.
Why is that important?
How would I know what he's thinking?
Shim Gun Wook is making this household into a warzone.
Then...
Is it true that...
- Tae Ra is seeing him?
- Do you finally get it?
I told you not to trust him, didn't I?
I told you to kick him out!
Your sister's going on about getting a divorce... so what were you doing until your sister's life got ruined?
- Did you just say, divorce?
- You and him are the same.
I don't even want to see your face.
Get out of here immediately.
What happened?
Do you know why Father collapsed?
Shim Gun Wook.
What?
Father apparently called him because he heard you were seeing him.
What exactly happened?
Are you seeing that bastard?
I'm asking if you're getting a divorce because of Shim Gun Wook.
How is Father doing right now?
- Move, so I can go inside.
- I'm asking you a question right now.
Tell me clearly.
You're right.
I'm seeing him.
Can't I?
Are you out of your mind right now?
Mo Ne looked up to you more than anyone else.
And you're doing what with the guy she was dating?
Tae Seong...
Let's talk about this later.
- Move.
- Get back to your senses.
That bastard stuck by my side so he could do whatever he wanted with us.
Don't you get it?
Don't say such things about him.
Noona.
Will you please move?
I'm going to kill that bastard.
- Tae Seong.
- You're here.
Tae Seong!
The door will be closing.
Why isn't this bastard picking up?
[Shim Gun Wook]
The number you have dialed could not be reached, so you will be directed to a voice messaging center...
Yes, Team Leader.
This is Hong Tae Seong.
Quickly find out Shim Gun Wook's address and call me back.
Father...
You get back to your senses.
This is all because of that bastard Shim Gun Wook.
Do you want to continue seeing him still?
Why did Father meet up with Gun Wook?
He found out that you were getting a divorce because of him and collapsed while trying to dissuade him.
That bastard might've threaten your father with something.
Mom...
My heart is also torn because of Father's collapse, but how does blaming Gun Wook for everything change anything?
How is Tae Gyun's death his fault?
It's not as if he holds a grudge against us, so why would he do that?
A grudge?
You're taking his side at a time like this?
Are you out of your mind?
Mom...
Oh hey, So Dam.
Is that so?
Talk to her outside.
Yes.
Yes, So Dam.
There's something you'll have to do for me.
It's something you should've taken care of a long time ago.
Please just take care of this without a trace.
It'll be difficult for me to do anything... that the president doesn't know about again.
I said it'll be the last time.
This matter affects my personal beliefs too.
Could I ask you why I need to do this?
Since when did you start being picky about what to do as your job?
Are you neglecting your job just because the president is unconscious right now?
You've been in Haeshin for a long time, haven't you?
How many years has it been for you?
It's been 30 years, Ma'am.
I'll give you the best position that I could ever give you.
I'll think about it, Ma'am.
Somebody has to do it.
Why?
Are you scared?
I'm not a patient person.
Remember... that this is your last chance.
Shim Gun Wook...
Do you think I'll leave him alone after what he's done to me?
Tae Seong...
You shouldn't...
You shouldn't meddle with Haeshin...
[APT#30, Shimin Apartments] [Hwe Hyun District, Downtown Seoul]
Hello?
Is this Shim Gun Wook's cell phone?
This is Section Chief Eun.
I have an urgent message for you.
Could I see you for a moment?
Oh.
Go and have some instant noodles.
- Chief, I think you just got a text.
- What?
Did I?
Did it come from my daughter?
Huh?
It's Shim Gun Wook.
Hey, what is this?
Shim Gun Wook has arrived at the destination!
Moonsan, Kyunggi County
This is a location finder.
Why did he send this to you?
Location finder?
Didn't he send this to me by mistake while trying to send it to someone else?
- Let's have a cup of coffee.
- Yes.
I take a step back,
Into the place seemingly close, but unreachable,
Your image, clouded in my tears, is painfully beautiful
I cut away at it once more,
My feelings that are growing, feeding on tears
Even though your name that I couldn't call out,
The number you have dialed could not be reached, so you will be directed to a voice messaging center...
Shim Gun Wook!
Shim Gun Wook!
Ah, wait.
Wait, who do you think you are acting so violently at a stranger's house?
Wait.
Wait, why are you doing this, Ahjussi?
Why are you doing this?
That's the washroom.
Wait a second.
Hey.
Why are you doing this?
Why are you doing this?
Coming into someone's house with your shoes on.
Where is that bastard, Shim Gun Wook?
What am I supposed to do if you just suddenly come to my house looking for Shim Gun Wook?
And is Shim Gun Wook your child or something?
Are you his father or something to call him a bastard?
Who are you?
I'm asking you where he is.
Did you just refer to me as, "you*"?
(*informal)
Wait.
Director, please have patience.
Gun Wook doesn't live here!
Then where does he live!
We don't know where he lives either!
- Which time period is that hairstyle from?
- Never mind that and...
- Tell that bastard to contact me if he comes here.
- Forget it.
What's this?
Wait, Haeshin Group?
Hong Tae Seong...
So what if you're an executive director?
Why are you at a stranger's house causing trouble?
There hasn't been an asshole like you... in the history of mankind!
That asshole.
Hey bring me some salt!
Spray some salt!
Hey you, are you all right?
[Moon Jae In]
Please move aside.
Everything's been taken care of.
Really?
You checked it with your own eyes, right?
Yes.
I'm at the hospital right now.
You've done a good job.
Yes, all right.
What happened?
It's been done according to your wishes.
All right.
Good job.
It seems like Department Head Kim wasn't trying to trick us.
You even put a tab on him, Ma'am?
Don't you know how stupid it is to trust someone?
This was supposed to be over 20 years ago.
I don't know if it was a mistake or intentional, but this all happened because he couldn't tie the knot.
We can't repeat the same mistake twice.
Then what about Shim Gun Wook...
Be careful with the words you speak.
Nothing happened.
Yes.
I understand, Ma'am.
I haven't been able to sleep for a while, but I guess I'll be able to sleep comfortably starting today.
Please sleep comfortably.
What do you think about changing your yoga program to something else?
A program like this will be good for you when your body is lacking flexibility.
Something bad must've happened.
No.
Have your legs like this and...
Put your arms back.
Your body's really flexible.
Open up your chest a bit.
Give me that.
- I'll do it, so stay outside.
- Ah, yes.
I took care of that troublesome person.
Without a trace.
I made him quietly disappear.
I'm sure you would've done the same.
He's someone who killed our Tae Gyun.
I shouldn't have brought that child in at that time.
It was my mistake.
In the end, since I took care of my own mistake...
You have to tell me that I've done a good job when you're awake.
That I've worked really hard.
Where's So Dam?
She went to a camp for learning English.
Then I guess I'll have to see her next time.
I think there will be a prosecutor's investigation about the company's slush funds soon and...
Why, do you need my help?
No.
Since father-in-law has collapsed, you'll be stuck in a perplexing situation.
Prepare yourself for it.
I know.
I'll be going.
I understand, sir.
Didn't Shim Gun Wook come to work?
Yes.
He hasn't come yet.
What happened to him?
Oh yeah.
Today's robot theme park presentation was supposed to be done by him.
Please try calling him.
Yes.
[Moon Jae In]
You can't reach him?
Ah yes.
He's not picking up.
This is a problem.
We need to prepare the data for the briefing and the vice-president is coming to this presentation too...
Uhm...
I'll try to prepare it.
You will?
Yes.
Then do so.
Yes.
Didn't Shim Gun Wook come to work?
He hasn't come yet.
Tell me if he's here.
Yes, sir.
All the board members have gathered.
Let's go to the meeting room.
It's this way, Ma'am.
[Robot Theme Park]
Please begin.
The robot theme park that we are aiming for is the world's first robot theme park.
We plan to have the visitors live their fantasies and enjoy themselves through their experiences with robots.
We plan to have them experience a futuristic society with robots.
Please go to the next slide.
What did you want to tell me?
What happened to Shim Gun Wook?
He missed an important presentation today.
Did you call me up because you were curious about that?
You went to meet him yesterday, didn't you?
I met him yesterday and... killed him.
What?
You're more surprised than when you heard that Father collapsed.
Was he so important to you?
Tae Seong.
I really tried to kill him, but...
I couldn't find him;
maybe because he ran away.
Oh yeah.
You know about that address in his resume?
That was all a lie too.
Stop it.
The reason that bastard... approached us...
I mean...
the reason he approached you...
Want me to tell you what it is?
Haeshin Group.
He was after this from the beginning.
He came in here as my secretary using Mo Ne, then he went to you after he gained my trust.
Then what happened?
Tae Gyun died and Father collapsed.
Then naturally, Haeshin would become yours.
That's what he was after from the beginning!
He was going to have Haeshin for himself using you!
Tae Seong... how could you...
Noona, you...
You're not going to tell me that it's love or anything like that, right?
You're not trying to argue that he had true feelings for you, right?
Please come back to your senses!
You were thoroughly used from the beginning!
Don't you get it?
You and Mo Ne and me!
All of us!
Get out.
Get out of my room immediately!
[Hong Tae Ra]
[Moon Jae In]
[Hong Tae Ra]
Hey So Dam.
[Your batteries are low...]
Noona.
I'm sorry.
Tae Seong.
Are you still seeing Hong Tae Seong?
Do you really need to see him knowing who he is?
You told me you'd break up with him.
That's... not going as well as I intended.
I told you you'd be hurt.
I know Tae Seong better than you.
Noona.
I can't continue to live like this forever.
I want to create my own family too.
With a loving husband, and a cute child.
Gun Wook.
Forget about everything now.
It'll be easy for you once you forget about it all.
Forget it all?
I'm sorry.
Tae Seong's waiting for me.
Why did you come so late?
Were you waiting?
Where is the place I'm heading to?
Is it heaven?
Or hell?
I couldn't meet that child in the end.
Since when did you find out about Shim Gun Wook?
Are you telling me... all of this was because of that child?
He was such a tender person when he was little...
The truth... tends to reveal itself after everything is over.
I'm sorry.
It's all right.
President!
President!
Ji Hyeon.
Did someone come into my room?
No...
I'm not sure.
Call Department Head Kim.
Quickly.
Yes, Ma'am.
Yes?
Pardon?
The president?
Well...
How is he?
Is he all right?
It was a type of heart stroke...
It could've been very dangerous.
The problem's gone, so he should be all right now.
Then when will he recover?
Well, we'll have to see, but even if he regains his consciousness,
I think it'll take some time for him to get back into his everyday lifestyle.
How did this happen?
Shim Gun Wook's dead body...
did you confirm it?
I confirmed it.
What is this, Ma'am?
It's the lighter that Shim Gun Wook carried around.
Don't you know about it?
Don't think about tricking me.
Madam, I'm already on the same boat.
How could I trick you?
Let's go together.
I need to confirm the dead body with my own eyes.
It's already been cremated.
Cremated?
I sprayed his ashes on a mountain the same day.
Please push the meeting I've planned with the construction planning team into the afternoon.
I'll see how the president is doing right now and head out in the afternoon.
Department Head Kim.
You took care of it for sure, right?
I came as soon as I finished work after hearing that you went to the hospital all of a sudden.
How is the president doing?
Tae Seong.
Father.
You know Jae In, right?
The girl who used to work at Mother's gallery.
Jae In, say hello.
President.
How do you do?
I am Moon Jae In.
The girl's pretty, right?
She'll be next to me, making me into an all right person.
They say getting married will make your parents happy too, right?
I'll make you happy, all right?
Tae Seong...
So stop lying there and get up.
What are you doing with a sick person in front of you?
You think the world belongs to you now that your father's collapsed?
We're having enough trouble as it is with the prosecutor's investigation and you're making your father unable to rest by bringing this low class girl?
Please don't talk about her that way.
- She's my woman.
- Your woman?
It's not like there's only a single woman you call your woman.
Please take a good look at her.
I'm saying this person, Moon Jae In, is my woman.
Jae In, you must be ecstatic.
However, don't expect too much from Tae Seong... since I'll never consider you as my daughter-in-law.
Mother!
Let's go.
Wait a second.
I'll see you again.
Mother.
Mother?
She's being right out and honest with her slyness.
Moon Jae In and Shim Gun Wook, they're all the same people.
People who are like trash, that try to crawl up to the top from the bottom.
We're all the way here, so you can go on home now.
I'm sad to part ways.
When my father wakes up, let's get married.
As soon as possible.
I've only caused trouble all this while.
After seeing Father like that,
I've come to regret it all.
But since you're here...
Courage to start again or something...
I'm getting something like that.
Thank you.
But your father should come first, so let's not hurry too much.
All right.
Head inside.
Yes.
The person you were trying to reach either has their phone turned off or...
Really, that Shim Gun Wook...
where has he gone to?
Please just say one thing to the camera.
What is the source of the slush funds?
Please tell me.
Just a single phrase, please.
What brings you here, sir?
We're from the prosecutor's office.
Please tell me what you think about the slush funds.
Didn't I tell you to use the back door?
Director, you had a guest at your house, so I escorted her here.
A guest came?
A guest did come.
- I tried to call you before...
- Uhm...
Are you able to contact Gun Wook?
Actually, I continuously contacted Gun Wook to ask him for your number, but...
I couldn't reach him.
But you haven't eaten yet, right?
All Koreans live off the strength they get from food, don't you think?
From Korean food.
- Why don't you take some time eating before...
- Then do you know where he is by any chance?
It's because he's not coming to work and I can't contact him either.
There's no way that Gun Wook would do that.
Just a second.
Go into the kitchen.
Go into the kitchen you...
I mean how many business cards has this guy put in here?
Detective!
What did you do with Gun Wook?
Are you sure you didn't lock him away somewhere again?
What do you mean?
Man that surprised me.
She says that he's disappeared.
Detective.
Oh, what brings you here?
Please find Gun Wook for me.
I thought you told us that you didn't know Shim Gun Wook.
I can't contact him.
Since when?
It's already been... about a week.
A week?
Yes.
We can't locate him using the GPS because his phone is turned off.
But where has he gone off to?
Chief, you got something from Shim Gun Wook that night though.
Yeah.
This.
Quickly take a look at it.
But what is that?
He sent his location to you.
What?
I'm sure someone was playing a joke on me.
Everything's already over with.
Shim Gun Wook.
[Entrance for visitors]
Are you all right?
Yes.
I'm sorry things had to end this way.
Sorry that it's late.
You... told me you tried to find out something about him, right?
Shim Gun Wook?
I can't contact him.
Do you know where he lives by any chance?
Are you telling me you didn't even know where he lived until now?
Men are supposed to bring the woman they like into their home first.
I know where he lives.
I had someone follow him for just a short, short while.
Don't get me wrong.
He looked dangerous to me.
So just in case...
Never mind.
What's the use of me telling you these kind of things?
It's open, Ma'am.
Gun Wook.
Are you here, Gun Wook?
Gun Wook...
Gun Wook!
How did you get here?
I can't contact him and he hasn't come to work either, so I was worried.
You're saying you came all the way to his house because you were worried?
Yes.
It's not your first time here, right?
Pardon?
Well, because it seems like you're very familiar with the place.
It's strange.
No one in the company knew where Gun Wook's house was... but you knew where it was.
Did Tae Seong tell you where it was?
Yes.
Tae Seong told me he didn't know where his house was either.
He told me that Gun Wook's address was different from the one on his resume.
Because we were friends...
I found out by chance and... he happened to live close to me too.
Is that so?
You're doing well with Tae Seong, right?
Pardon?
We might even become family, so shouldn't I have the rights to ask you such a question?
Are your feelings towards Tae Seong... sincere?
Yes.
But... you know about Gun Wook's house that no one else knows about?
Does Tae Seong know about this?
He knows that Gun Wook is close to me.
Is that so?
Then don't concern yourself with other things and concern yourself with Tae Seong.
Since no man likes his girlfriend going into another man's house.
I understand.
However, I can't help but worry since I wasn't able to contact him for a long time.
How did you... get in here?
Gun Wook gave me a key a while back.
Telling me to come in anytime I wanted to.
Gun Wook did?
Then have you been staying in contact with Gun Wook?
I haven't been able to contact him and he wasn't home for a week.
Where is he?
I have no idea why you concern yourself so much about Shim Gun Wook.
He has no family, so I should at least take care of him to...
Don't worry.
I sent him on a vacation.
A vacation?
A complicated matter arose, so I thought it'd be better for him to be out of the country for a while.
When everything in my house and company calms down, he'll be back again.
So stop worrying about Gun Wook from now on.
And when Gun Wook comes back...
We're going to get married.
You're going to... get married?
We've only talked about it amongst ourselves for now.
Please keep it a secret for a while.
From Tae Seong too.
But why are you telling me things like this?
I'm telling you not involve yourself in Gun Wook's matters anymore.
Don't you get what I'm saying?
Please leave.
Since it's rude to be in someone's house when they're not home.
Don't do this next time.
Aren't we the same... in the sense that... this house doesn't belong to you?
Anyways, I'm glad to hear that he's on vacation.
Then I'll be leaving.
What is it?
Where's your sister?
She left work early.
But she's not picking up her phone.
Am I my sister?
How would I know that?
You hate me, right?
What should I do about this?
I've already chosen someone as my brother-in-law.
Is that so?
That's a problem.
How could I change my sister-in-law's mind?
Let's quickly find your sister and the three of us can eat together.
Wait a sec.
Wait a sec.
Hold that cell phone in your hand like this and...
- Yeah.
- And try turning it like this.
- Like this?
- No!
Like this!
Like this.
Oh!
Nice!
I got your number.
Ahjussi, I won't leave you alone if you send my sister home late from now on!
I'll be sure to be on your case.
All right Sister-in-law.
So, did I get your number right now?
Sister...
Who's your sister-in-law?
You keep saying that since earlier...
It just rolls off my tongue.
Sister-in-law Won In.
"The Problem" and "The Cause"?
(*puns on Moon Jae and Won In's names)
Stop it, okay?
The other kids don't make fun of people's names because it's corny...
Ahjussi, do you have a 1000 won on you?
1000 won?
Man...
Why do the women in your household like money so much?
Here.
Sister-in-law, treat this as your allowance.
Here.
Give me your wallet for a sec.
[Personal Check]
How can you not even carry a single 1000 won bill around?
I guess you're not even treating it as money since it's such a small amount, but you shouldn't do that.
- Jeez...
- Is that so?
Then give it back to me.
- Give it back and I'll go change it for you.
- No.
No.
Just go.
- Just give it!
- You shouldn't keep doing that!
If you like 1000 won bills so much, I'll go and exchange it for fifty 1000 won bills for you.
You shouldn't be like that!
I think you have some sort of a misunderstanding.
I'm serious about seeing Tae Ra right now.
What's the reason you're approaching each one of the family members to capture their hearts...
I've thought about it again and again.
In the end even you are only capable of such thoughts.
I wanted to see you.
What and who you like right now and what you're feeling right now!
What I want to hear are your true feelings.
You're the most beautiful person here.
I'm sorry... that I love you.
I sent him on a vacation.
A complicated matter arose, so I thought it'd be better for him to stay out of the country for a while.
And when Gun Wook comes back, we're going to get married.
We've only talked about it amongst ourselves for now.
Please keep it a secret for a while.
The location that Shim Gun Wook has sent you is around here.
It's just a road here, isn't it?
Then why did he send me his location from here?
- Try and see if you can find anything.
- All right.
Chief!
Here!
Hey.
- It has blood on it.
- Yes.
- Bag it.
- All right.
Oh, and also.
Find out about any recent accidents that took place here.
Check to see if there were any car accidents on that day using the nearby security cameras.
This chair is comfortable...
Oh, you're home?
Tae Seong ahjussi came by earlier.
Unni, did you decide not to date Gun Wook ahjussi?
I heard he went on a vacation.
Huh?
Where?
Why didn't you go along with him?
Gun Wook and I... shouldn't be together.
What are you talking about all of a sudden?
We shouldn't even be friends now.
Because that way... we'll both get what we want.
What is it that you want?
Money?
That's right.
Money.
A rich household.
Are you happy now?
So Gun Wook ahjussi was seducing a lady from a rich family too, right?
I knew it from the moment he was talked about life-saving ropes.
No one thinks about trying to earn money by themselves and they all go looking for rich people.
- It's pathetic!
Pathetic I say!
- Be quiet!
And you... don't talk about Shim Gun Wook around me from now on.
- Why?
My mouth belongs to me!
- Don't talk about him I said!
Since I'll forget everything too.
You won't see him again either.
Is it in your power to meet or avoid people as you wish?
Can you do that as you wish?
If you could freely...
meet or avoid someone...
It can be as I wish.
I can just ignore them even if I see them.
Mom.
What's the matter?
Your father's absent and the directors will start acting up if we don't do anything.
I came to discuss something with you... but what's this?
Are you really trying to divorce Prosecutor Park?
That's already over with.
Please don't say anything about it.
Are you saying you'll really get a divorce because of him?
It's not because of him, but...
I don't want to live like this anymore.
I'm going to get a divorce even if you try to stop me.
Who says you can get a divorce?
I say I can.
I want to live life the way I want to now.
So please, don't meddle with my life anymore.
What?
Don't meddle with your life?
So, are you saying you're going to marry him or something after the divorce?
There's no reason I can't get married if I love him.
Get married?
To him?
Who do you think he is to say you're going to marry him?
Who do you think he is?
Who is he?
How do I know who he is?
Yes, Detective.
How did it go?
Mom.
You're hiding something from me, aren't you?
Who is he?
Tell me.
Why does that matter?
Mo Ne and after that, Tae Gyun, and now that poisonous snake is trying to ruin your life too!
I won't live to see that happen!
I said I like him, Mom!
I...
love him.
He's dead.
What?
What do you mean, a car accident?
I definitely heard that he was on vacation.
On vacation?
They said he was brought to this hospital.
Please don't worry too much.
Since it might not be Shim Gun Wook.
He's dead?
What do you mean by that?
Gun Wook died?
I'm telling you to think of him as if he's dead.
Why would I have to think of him like that?
Do you think I'll give up on him then?
I can give up on Haeshin, Father, you and everything!
But...
I can never give up on him.
I'm going to marry him as soon as the divorce proceedings are through.
What?
You can give up on everything but him?
You must have gone insane.
Shim Gun Wook, that bastard... is the very child who was kicked out of our house 20 years ago!
And you're going to get a divorce to marry him?
What?
What do you mean...
What do you mean he's that child?
So they're saying they shipped him off to a different hospital because there's no morgue here.
Yes chief.
They say his guardian came and they moved him with an ambulance.
What guardian are they talking about when Shim Gun Wook has no family?
Who exactly moved the dead Shim Gun Wook...
Dead?
What do you mean by that?
You've heard him wrong.
We thought it was Shim Gun Wook,
- but it turned out to be...
- No!
I heard everything.
You said "the dead Shim Gun Wook."
That child.
He perfectly disguised himself as Hong Tae Seong 20 years ago and came into our house.
That same child.
What?
I knew it back then, but he became an outright crook and came back to us.
Th-that child... is Gun Wook?
What are you talking about right now, Mom?
You're lying, right?
Why would I lie?
We raised him with all we had for a year and this is what he's turned into after 20 years.
He killed Tae Gyun, and he even made your father collapse.
Our good deeds have been paid back as a vengeance.
No way...
How...
How...
Do you get it now?
He held a grudge against us after being kicked out 20 years ago and he approached us with a plan in his mind.
That poisonous snake.
No way...
That can't be true.
That definitely can't be true.
You know it too, Mom.
You remember how kind... innocent, compassionate and tender that child was, don't you?
I don't have any memories like that.
He was fearsome and resilient ever since he was young.
You didn't even know that and protected him in your arms.
20 years ago and even now.
No way...
How...
Get back to your senses.
Do you know what he tried to do using you?
That bastard tried to ruin us and have Haeshin for himself.
In the end when the truth came to light, he asked me for money.
He told me that he'd be like a dead man and live quietly.
Please leave.
Tae Ra.
All right.
I'll leave.
But know this.
That bastard came here to ruin you.
You're lying, right?
Moon Jae In...
They say Shim Gun Wook was transported to this hospital that night, but... due to excessive bleeding, he...
No.
That's not true.
That's probably not Gun Wook.
We'll try to find some more information on it.
- So don't be so agitated.
- But Chief...
- Shim Gun Wook was almost...
- Shush!
You're lying, right?
If he really died, then I'll at least go to see his body at least.
About that...
They say someone already took his body.
No way.
Who did?
Gun Wook doesn't even have family.
There's no way Haeshin would know, that Shim Gun Wook is Hong Tae Seong either, and even if they did, they wouldn't have a reason to take the body...
What are you talking about now?
What do you mean Shim Gun Wook is Hong Tae Seong?
And what does Haeshin have to do with this?
To tell you the truth,
Shim Gun Wook was the other Hong Tae Seong who was adopted and disowned before Executive Director Hong Tae Seong came into their family.
The other Hong Tae Seong, you say?
Gun Wook is?
He held a grudge against us after being kicked out 20 years ago and he approached us with a plan in his mind.
That poisonous snake.
I take a step back,
Into the place seemingly close, but unreachable
Even though your name that I couldn't call out,
Gun Wook...
I'm sorry
You're pulling a prank on me right now, aren't you?
Where are you?
Hurry up and come out.
Hurry up and come out.
Hurry...
Hurry up and come out.
I don't like this.
Hurry up and come out!
I'm sorry.
Hurry up and come out.
I'm sorry.
I want to see you.
I want to see you.
I want to see you.
I'm sorry.
Where are you?
I want to see you.

Why can't we find one man?
No one wants to find your father's killer more than I, but those responsible killed him and scattered his atoms to the wind.
Then I want the DNA from his ashes to prove it.
I'd like to speak to T'Challa, please.
- Who is calling?
- It's Ororo.
Let's say I join your team.
What are my chances of winning this thing?
Pretty good.
There is no doubt in my mind that he will die by the hand of Klaw.
Hah!
Ha ha!
I've always wanted to try that.
This trip was worth it for that alone.
Great.
One less black rhino in the world.
They're an endangered species.
I didn't know you were such an animal lover, Frenchie.
We are guests in this country.
It's just good manners.
Yeah.
Like the way you frogs lifted your skirts to the Nazis before we had to save your butts.
Repayment for helping finance your revolution, imbecile.
Oh, yeah?
How about...
If anybody got a problem with me, step up!
Got that, Frenchie?
I don't know if you can fight, Juggernaut, but you are certainly the most clever American I've ever met.
Ha ha ha!
You got that r-
Hey.
Is that a wisecrack?
I appreciate your restraint there, Petrarch.
Why is it that the muscle in any operation always has to be so stupid?
The Juggernaut fought the Hulk and walked away.
God help us all if he had a brain.
Ehh.
Good point.

Get out my way.
How's it going in there, Igor?
The toilet is backing up again.
Well, we can't send someone in to fix it now.
Radiation levels are too high.
Come on.
You've got the tech to spare.
It stinks in here.
Now the Russian's all hygienical.
Just shove another bottle of vodka in there.
Ha!
Juggernaut, Igor is a key part of our plan, so shut up.
Igor:
Klaw.
I'll see what I can do, Igor.
Uh, Klaw, I have to express my admiration for your operation, but I've studied our target.
Realistically, what are our chances of killing the Black Panther?
Chances?
Pretty good, considering I've already killed one.
Klaw:
The Vanderberg Conference some years ago.
An annual meeting of the world's top economic powers
The kind of get-together that gives conspiracy theorists palpitations.
I was there to kill a man.
On a job?
I was hired, yes, but it was also personal.
I knew this job would make my reputation internationally.
Plenty of potential employers there.
Third world countries aren't normally invited to real meetings like this.
That's what the U.N. is for:
a place for the powerless to whine about the white man.
But they invited Wakanda to the big boys' table because everyone wanted a crack at their resources:
untouched petroleum deposits, medical cures unknown in the Western world, and vibranium- the rarest, most valuable mineral on Earth.
Your Majesty, we will pay whatever price you set for your goods.
They are not for sale.
Until the spiritual advancement of the West catches up to their technological prowess, it would be irresponsible to share our scientific discoveries with you.
Are you calling everyone here irresponsible children?
No.
More like sullen teenagers who feel more mature than their behavior warrants.
The fact that every conversation here is framed in terms of profit and power says it all.
You could have made half these breakthroughs yourself, but there's too much money to be made in misery.
Why cure a disease when people pay for medicine?
Why provide cheap energy when-
Yeah, we get the point, T'Chaka.
I have never met a socialist with a crown on his head before, but I guess there is a first time for everything.
Who gave you permission to use my first name?
I
- I'm sorry.
I did not mean to offend.
I understand your frustration in dealing with a black man who can't be bought with a truck full of guns, a plane full of blondes, and a Swiss bank account.
But please, hold on to what little class you have.
Your Majesty, I truly apologize.
This meeting is over.
Klaw:
Once it was clear there was no deal to be made, my job kicked in.
This was not an easy gig.
A month before the conference, they shut the hotel down for security purposes, laid off any employee that had worked there less than a year.
Why do we have to leave immediately, Father?
You said we could go skiing.
Now this is why we have to leave!
The children grow more insolent with each breath of European air.
Klaw:
I knew the glass was bulletproof, but that didn't worry me.
The armor-piercing shell would blow right through that.
What I didn't know was that his security had applied a micron-thin layer of vibranium over the glass.
It absorbed the boring vibrations enough to stop the shot.
We had seconds to recover before we lost the window of opportunity entirely.
Time for Plan B.
I had been waiting beneath the floorboards for a week.
I was getting $10 million to kill someone I'd do for free.
There was no way I would fail.
Obviously, the point of an entrance like that is to create as much chaos as possible to keep an edge against an opponent this dangerous.
I got lucky right off the bat.
When that piece of debris took out the second in line to the throne, it- well, it really distracted the Panther.
Killing the entire family wasn't part of the commission, but throwing in those little extras can really endear you to an employer.
Then came the most dangerous moment:
right before the kill, when both sides are vulnerable.
He was so fast, I wasn't sure if those extra seconds I bought would be enough.
I don't know where the claws came from.
In his robes?
I thought he only had them in his panther gear.
Anyway, he was slashing my face, and I was about to lose an eye.
He had blocked one gun, but the other one was right in position.

Is this the decision?
It is.
Can you pay the price?
All of it.
The beast requires flesh to become flesh.
Your blood will be his price.
Revenge.
A worthy cause, but at a great price.
No.
Ha!
I need you more.
I need to come back in style.
I need... a posse.
Who will be my new playthings?
A little piece of behemoth.
[raspy breathing]
I dub thee Punchy.
[laughing]
I didn't want all this.
I wanted just one.
You.
What?
More than you bargained for?
Consider it a bonus, bozo.
You, Gemini.
Freak Show.
Ahh, succubus.
Batty Boop.
I always wanted a girlfriend.
What?
Where did he go?
Who is to be my victim?
No.
What's happening?
I guess we're going home, schnookums.
Oops!
I don't want to go.
I want to kill.
[clown screaming]
Okay, everybody, listen up.
Party's over.
Move out, come on.
Now, let's go.
People, move it.
See you later.
Be careful.
I am so sorry, Officer, everything just got out of hand.
And, um...
Do you live here?
No, but I'm house sitting for my professor.
And he's out of town.
Okay, keep it down, please.
Yes, Officer.
One warning, that's it.
Okay, thank you.
Good night.
Thank you, Officer.
Thank you.
Good job, baby.
God, what the hell?
Looks like your little shindig got out of hand, huh?
This has been a fucking great party.
Best spring break ever, right?
If it wasn't for the swine flu,
Whose idea was it to invite half the campus?
I said only a few people.
You guys have got to help me clean this place up before the Professor gets back.
Sandie, come on, you know?
You know we're gonna help you clean up.
I mean, look.
Whoa, Erica!
Erica!
Let me just get the bottles.
Sorry, okay.
I'll get the bottles.
You get the paper.
[Man] Baby, it's gonna be okay.
We'll help you clean up this godforsaken.
OSHA-condemned disaster zone up.
Stop trying to make me feel better.
I caught these two making out in the closet.
Yeah, I think that's romantic, too...
I do.
Zilla, you're so funny.
Dude, what's wrong with you?
Look, man, I just get nervous, all right?
Nervous?
You had the entire night to talk to her.
I know, but I'm kinda shy, man.
It takes me a while to warm up to a girl.
You're on the Dean's List.
Girls line up for you, man.
I really like Erica.
Baby, baby, I gotta get Zilla hooked up.
Zilla?
He's not a little boy.
He can do his own dirty work.
That's what I said, but he really likes your BFF.
He's been giving her those puppy dog eyes all night.
She didn't notice?
No, she responds to audible speech and other social cues.
Not smoke signals.
What the hell's the matter with him?
He's shy, nervous.
He starts sweating, fidgeting and stammering.
Hot flashes, cold flashes, lukewarm flashes.
Then it's just a total body meltdown.
Frankly, I think the reason we call him Zilla is because his breath's a little stinky.
What the hell happened in his childhood?
Why does he follow you around like a puppy dog?
'Cause I'm the quarterback, baby.
The man with the plan.
He takes care of me on the gridiron.
And I take care of him in the real world.
He looks up to me.
Well, he's in trouble.
So are you.
[both gasping]
Sorry, Zilla.
It's fine, Erica.
Are you sleeping here tonight?
Absolutely, I am.
I think I have a shirt you can sleep in.
Don't worry about it, Sandie.
I sleep in the nude.
Well, look at that.
It's past my bedtime.
I guess I should get going.
I'll see you guys later.
Later.
Bye, Zilla.
Thanks for helping me clean up.
You saved my butt.
You're way too serious, baby.
It was a mistake to have the party here.
The Professor gets back in three days.
This is the last of it.
I finished the bedrooms.
Any puke up there?
Just in the bathrooms.
Thank God for linoleum.
I know.
By the way, where are the mirrors?
What?
I didn't see any mirrors.
Where'd you put them?
Come to think of it there weren't any mirrors in the house.
That's odd.
Coffee.
The paper.
I'll get the paper.
That's nice, dear.
What the hell is that?
I have no idea.
I just found it outside.
Somebody obviously left it for us.
Rojer, I don't live here.
Just a house sitter.
Maybe it's for the Professor.
Does it have a note attached?
No, nothing.
I have no idea.
Let's open it.
We can't.
It's probably not for us.
You can't open mail that's not yours.
Don't you know that?
This isn't mail.
Just some bag.
We're not gonna know what's inside of it unless we open it up.
So what do you suggest?
Erica and Zilla are gonna be here tonight.
Yeah, baby, they will.
What are you thinking?
Maybe it was left for one of them.
So you want to wait till later to open it?
Yeah.
We'll find out what's in the bag later tonight.
All right.
What is it?
We don't know.
Looks like a painting.
Maybe someone has a secret admirer.
Let's open it.
No, you guys, this could be for the Professor.
I don't see his name on it.
Yeah, baby, how long are we gonna wait?
It's probably something perishable.
Perishable?
Like fruit.
I'm just impressed he used a word with more than three syllables.
Okay, children.
Cut it out.
Okay, fine, let's open it.
Let's see what the hell's inside.
[Rojer] I think someone thought you needed a mirror.
Maybe they thought the Professor needed a mirror, Rojer.
It's beautiful.
So ornate.
It's probably an artifact,
Hey, Roj, check it out.
That's my favorite part here.
Don't worry, Sandie.
Nothing scary happens.
Just watch.
What about it?
[all gasp]
[Rojer] What the hell?
That's your favorite part, man?
It's awesome, dudes!
Tomorrow night the Professor's back.
Before back to the dorms.
One more night to make a little trouble.
I'll drink to that.
Come on, give me a picture, damn it!
[Batty Boop] Maybe you need some bunny ears.
Yeah, well, Punchy ate the last set.
And anyway, aren't we digital yet?
Do you got the right input selected?
I don't know.
I'm not an evil queen.
You're dressed like one.
Shut up!
Operation manual.
All right, fish breath, come on, hand it over.
Here...
Chinese, I don't...
All right, fuck it.
Mirror, mirror, on the wall, who's the baddest motherfucking clown of all?
I'm talking about Killjoy.
[mirror rattles]
[grunts]
Killjoy.
[Killjoy] Well, you know my name!
Seems you have me at a bit of a disadvantage, big boy.
What the hell?
It's Killjoy.
You already said that!
Now who the fuck are you?
Well, whatever your name is...
Zilla.
Zilla. [Laughing]
As in God?
Zilla.
You're scary.
Now what are you gonna do about it, big boy?
I'm gonna kick your fucking ass, homey.
[laughs ]
Not "homey." Killjoy.
But don't you think it would be better if you picked on someone your own size, huh?
Oh, Punchy!
Ooph!
[Chuckles]
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
And it looks like it's fight time!
In this corner, hailing from who the fuck cares is a fucking dude named after a Japanese monster.
But in this corner, the unstoppable force, the Babylonian behemoth.
Put your hands in the air for Punchy, the hobo clown!
All right, come here you.
Come here you.
All right, I want a nice clean fight.
Kinda like a I need another asshole in my other armpit.
Right?
[makes farting sounds]
No fish hooking, no hitting below the belt.
[groans]
No rabbit punching.
[laughing]
Get up, get up, get up, get up.
Time to fight, fight, fight, fight fight, fight, fight, fight.
Oh!
[bell rings]
Back to your corner, back to your corner.
[Killjoy] Come on.
Okay, okay.
Okay. [Groans]
That was great, kid.
You almost got this one.
I swear to God.
You just gotta stick a move, stick a move, all right?
Come on, come on.
Here, right here, have a drink.
No, wait!
You're supposed to spit in this one.
Spit!
Oh, yeah!
You got this.
Remember your namesake Zilla, right?
Stick a move.
Work the body.
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Up, up, up, go!
Come on.
[gibberish]
What the hell are you?
He's the unstoppable force!
[grunting]
[wincing]
No!
Come on, Rojer.
[Zilla panting]
Hey, Zilla!
Zilla!
Hey!
Hey, what...
No!
What's wrong?
No!
[Rojer] Zilla.
Help!
Sandie, get my phone.
It's on the table.
[Rojer] Call 911.
Hey, buddy.
[Man] What is your emergency?
My friend, he's having a seizure.
Really?
He's getting the shit beat out of him.
Send a fucking ambulance!
Okay, here it comes.
What the fuck!
Come on, buddy.
Hey, how are you?
Hey.
Zilla.
He's coming to.
[laughs, stammers]
What?
No.
Where the fuck did he go?
You should have finished him off.
Uh-oh... [gibberish] [screams]
I hate it when they get away!
Don't worry, baby.
They ain't going nowhere.
Nowhere but here.
We got him.
He's coming to.
Hey, bud, we got you.
[panting]
Let's get him up.
Let's get him up.
I got you, come on.
Come on, get up.
Gotcha, bro.
Here we go.
Here we go.
On the couch.
I can't beat him.
I can't beat him.
There you go.
He's a huge...
he's a huge...
Zilla, what happened?
Unstoppable force.
You all right, bud?
Big fucking boxing gloves.
What are you on?
Hey, Zilla, doesn't use drugs, okay?
Big bodies.
It could be something else.
You all right, buddy?
Hey!
I don't know.
Zilla, what happened?
I don't know.
It was like a...
It was like a dream.
A really bad dream.
I saw Killjoy.
Killjoy.
No fucking way.
Who's Killjoy?
No one.
Just a hallucination.
No.
What's with the ambulance?
Where's the phone?
The phones are dead.
What do you mean dead?
I thought you got through.
I don't think so.
The operator was...
Was what?
Doesn't matter.
I'm gonna get us out of here.
I'm gonna get the car.
I'm gonna be right back.
Take Zilla to the hospital myself.
What the fuck?
What?
What's the problem?
I don't know.
I can't get out!
Something's blocking the fucking door.
What?
Get back.
Next time, we've got to get every bit of him through.
I know, schnookums.
Don't worry.
He'll be back.
As long as he looks in the mirror.
They'll all look.
They can't help it.
Why can't I just go in there and kill them?
Booya!
Because if they die in there, we don't get to collect their souls.
They've got to come to me.
[winces]
That clown was just beating the hell out of me.
Then you guys pulled me out of it.
You mean we woke you up.
No, I wasn't sleeping.
You pulled me out of it.
Zilla, you were unconscious.
Then let him rest.
It's a little hard to believe this shit.
Our phones don't fucking work, and we're trapped inside this house, okay?
But something weird is happening.
Come on, Sandie.
As you said, let's let him rest.
All right, let's try to get him up to one of the beds and then try and find a way out of here.
Hey, Zilla, buddy, come on.
Here we go.
There we go.
Come on, Sandie, you lead him.
Okay.
I'll be up in a second.
I'm gonna clean up the blood.
[Rojer] All right.
Thataway, buddy, thataway.
Good job.
Good job.
Oh, my God.
You flatter me.
You can't be real.
Really?
What do you think happened to your friend?
You think he cut himself shaving?
Or fell down the stairs?
You're a demon of vengeance.
What do you want with us?
Who would want vengeance on us?
Who indeed?
Vengeance is mine.
But I'm innocent.
Innocent?
Oh, yes, you must be joking. [Laughs] [gas hisses] [groans]
Innocent.
That may be true.
You see, you're not really the one that I want.
[laughs]
Your ass is mine!
[laughing]
You guys believe me, right?
What do you mean?
That I saw him, saw Killjoy.
Zilla, I think it's better if you just get some rest.
Yeah, lay back.
We gotta figure out what's going on here.
Then we're gonna deal with it.
All right?
Just chill.
Just relax.
What's going on?
What's going on?
Huh?
He's...
He's real.
Demon from hell.
Who?
He feeds for revenge.
Ten years ago.
What are you talking about?
A decade ago he was summoned.
Killed the boy who summoned him.
He gets joy from death.
Guys... stay away from the mirror.
[grunts]
[no audible dialogue]
Erica.
Erica.
Erica, is that you?
[grunts]
What the fuck was that?
No, Zilla, stay down.
I'm fine, Sandie.
What the hell happened to you, man?
I don't fucking know.
Thought I saw someone.
Who?
Who'd you see?
I don't know.
It was weird.
I turned around.
No one was there.
Maybe it was Erica.
It wasn't fucking Erica.
Where is Erica?
I don't know.
You guys haven't seen her?
No.
Erica.
Erica.
Erica?
Erica.
Erica.
Erica?
Sandie, don't touch it.
I think that's her.
Sounds like she's in the mirror.
Erica.
Hello, kiddies.
Ahhh!
Doesn't she look delicious?
Holy shit, fucking Killjoy.
You're damn right it's Killjoy.
That's him, I guess.
[mocking] That's him, I guess.
What have you done with Erica?
Don't get your panties in a bunch.
I'll get to her in a minute.
What do you want?
A feast, if you will.
So you're just going to let us all enjoy this scrumptious meal by ourselves?
Are you?
Oh!
Oh!
[sniffs] She smells delectable!
You better get away from her or I'll...
You'll what?
When you decide to join me, you know where the door is.
Do you think they'll come?
They'll come.
But where is he, our guest of honor?
[Batty Boop] Not to worry, my painted prince.
Hi.
Cheer up.
Your friends will come.
And we'll all have a bite.
[gasps]
Puppy meat, yum yum now?
Hold on there, tubby.
You'll have your chance.
Keep basting.
[groans]
Where's the salt?
You're not seriously suggesting...
You have a better idea?
You don't know what we're up against.
I have a pretty good idea.
I'm gonna arm myself any way I can.
I suggest you do the same, especially if we're gonna go after Erica.
Okay, I guess you're right.
So we're going in.
We are going in, right?
Yes, we're going in, but, Zilla, you don't have to go.
I may be beat up, but I'm bigger than both of you put together.
You're gonna need me in there.
Here it is.
I see your point.
All right, what else repels demons?
[Rojer] I don't know.
Zilla, what do you think?
How the fuck should I know?
I'm not a comic book character.
You were in there.
You had the most contact with him.
They're the ones that had all the contact, with my face.
Easy, guys.
We have to think here.
What kills a demon?
What can we use against them?
All right, maybe we oughta slow down and think this a little bit further.
Change up our strategy a little bit.
What do you mean?
He's a clown, right?
Why are we afraid of clowns?
'Cause they're fucking stupid.
How's this gonna help us?
A lot of little kids are afraid of clowns.
Yeah, why is that?
Where you going with this?
Because they do horrible things to each other, and we're supposed to laugh.
I'm not laughing at Killjoy.
I get it.
That's the point.
What is?
Exactly.
He's a clown.
Maybe we're supposed to laugh.
[Sandie] Don't shut the door!
What's the hell's going on here?
Professor.
What are you kids doing?
The door's stuck.
We're trapped.
Trapped?
Sir, you wouldn't believe us even if we told you.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
It's already begun.
What's begun?
You know what's going on, don't you?
Did a package arrive here?
You know about this?
When did package arrive and how did it come?
We didn't know what it was.
How did it come?
It was in a bag on the porch.
You took it out of the bag?
Yeah, Zilla already got the living shit beat out of him, okay?
And Erica's stuck in there, in the fucking mirror.
With him.
Killjoy.
Yeah.
Killjoy.
We gotta go in there and get her.
No, no, no.
You don't know what you're dealing with.
Excellent, excellent.
His soul is the most crucial.
Baby, what's so important about him?
He is the fool who conjured me.
It's his blood that fed my resurrection.
And it's got to be his blood that completes me.
Pumpkin, then why are we waing our time with these dumb kids?
Bat, you floozy!
We've got to get that old man in here.
He's got to come to us.
Besides, they just rot when you kill them out there.
Sorry, Mr. Crabbycakes.
Yikes!
I still don't get why you care so much about this one.
Because this one stiffed me.
This one owes me a victim.
You cannot just summon a demon of vengeance and not have a victim to sacrifice.
I need sacrifice!
I need blood.
[Rojer] Let me see if I got this right.
His name isn't even Killjoy?
Not his real name, not the original one.
How do we kill this thing and get out of here?
And that's my job, and your job is to get your friend back.
This is the research that I've been doing on this demon.
As you can see, Killjoy's a relatively new name, but he's existed in the canon since ancient times.
So why does he keep coming back?
People conjure him for vengeance.
Just to wreak havoc and revenge.
I get it.
What does he want with you?
Well, we have a disagreement.
You gotta be kidding me.
That's not important.
Do you wanna get your friend back?
Or don't you?
Yeah, we do.
What's the plan?
We created demons.
We created religion.
We created the books that gave them life.
We feed them with our thoughts, our prayers but we're also the ones that wrote the book.
What does that mean?
It means that if we understand the demon, we can control it.
And I can make it feel pain.
So tell us what to do.
What I'm going to do is call Killjoy by his true name, his original name, and then that will give me power over him.
And then with the knowledge that I've gained from these ancient pages,
I'll be able to banish him.
Why don't you tell us his real name now?
It must be in his presence.
All you have to do is get your friend back through the mirror, and I'll handle the rest.
You sure you can take care of him on your own?
I've been doing research on this demon for years.
I'll deal with it.
Okay, when do we go in?
You getting cold feet now?
Cold feet?
Young man,
We're about to come face-to-face with a pure expression of evil.
If you're not afraid, you will be.
Come on, come on, what's taking them so long?
Perhaps I should give them some incentive, eh?
Come on out!
Come on!
What the hell was that?
Shit, man, I got a bad feeling about this.
No shit.
[Killjoy] What's the holdup?
Dinner is ready and waiting.
If you don't come,
Guess that was the dinner bell.
Ready, guys?
How could it wait?
Let's get it over with.
I'll go first.
Booya!
Hello, pretty boy.
[slurps]
Am I supposed to be here?
Sure you are.
Where else would you be?
On a rescue mission, I think.
Finally, someone to take me away from all this.
Really?
Save me!
Hey, I got a girlfriend.
What?
How dare you make lewd and lascivious advances on me when you got a girlfriend.
Think of her.
I am.
I am.
You are what?
You're one of those crazy psycho-bitches, aren't you?
I think that's the sweetest thing anyone's ever told me.
[grunts]
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Can we talk?
Remember, just get your friend.
Leave Killjoy to me.
Okay.
What the fuck!
Hey, baby, where have you been all this time?
I've been a good girl.
Really?
Have you?
Yes.
Where's Erica?
What, you mean dinner?
The main course.
Where's Rojer and Zilla?
Those two pathetic clowns are being well taken care of.
Don't worry about them.
You fucking bastard, you better not hurt my friends or I'll...
Or what?
People keep saying that and I want to know what.
Let me guess.
You're going to call me names.
No.
Well, then, maybe you're going to laugh at me.
Do you find me funny, huh?
No?
Watch this.
Didn't you think that was funny?
No.
Well, then you gotta dance.
What?
Dance!
Dance.
Get this through your pretty little head, when you say "or what,".
Or what?
You'll never see your friends again.
We'll have just a quickie, you know?
In and that's it.
Don't you mean in and out?
I got teeth everywhere, honey.
There's no out.
Shit!
Your girlfriend won't know.
She will if my dick's bitten off.
Really?
Don't you got a boyfriend?
What a dreamboat.
Killjoy.
If you're cheating on him, he'll cheat on you.
He wouldn't do that.
How do you know?
You see, Punchy, what I'm getting at is social equality is not just a textbook concept.
It's a reality, and not just back on earth.
There is no reason why you can't demand justice, why you can't demand equality, some roll-on deodorant.
And it all starts with you.
The higher-ups aren't gonna do a damn thing about it.
They just sit on your shoulders while you do the brunt of the work.
What the hell gives Killjoy the right to push you around?
[gibberish]
Come again.
Bunnies.
Bunnies.
Now dance!
Why fight it?
What's that?
Why fight it?
I'm already trapped here.
You're not so bad.
I take offense at that.
I mean...
You're kinda sexy.
Hell, you're hot.
You noticed.
Yeah, I work out a little bit.
It's not all balloon puppets, creamy maggot pies and juggling, you know?
See that?
It would appear that you're trying to make a deal with me.
Look,
I know who's boss around here.
I can get used to this.
I'm not a fool.
But I can be one for you.
So you want to bargain for your life?
What could you possibly offer me?
I could offer you something that you've never had before.
And what would that be?
Consensual sex.
And...
I'm a virgin.
[gasping]
Thank you, evil one.
Here's something...
I'm gonna take...
I've never had consensual sex before.
I'm sorry.
Follow my lead.
Okay.
[thud]
Nothing.
I thought you said you were a virgin.
I watch a lot of porn.
Take me.
I'm yours.
Okay.
Oh.
Hey, baby, what are you doing here?
I see you're playing with your food.
This?
This is not what it looks like.
Okay, chowder breath.
What's it look like?
She was coming on to me.
Are you actually telling the truth?
Yes, yes.
Ow!
Damn it, Batty!
What the hell!
Am I supposed to believe that?
Yes, mm-hmm.
Besides, you get to play with your food.
Weren't you just getting your rocks off with her boyfriend?
What?
[Batty and Killjoy] Shut up!
I'm a succubus.
That's my job.
What's your excuse?
[laughing]
I'm Killjoy.
I don't need no stinkin' excuse!
[laughs]
Let vengeance be mine.
Power to the people, Punchy.
Power to the people!
Power to the puppies!
[clang]
What's that?
Yum yum now.
Oh, God.
Welcome all to my feast.
The feast of souls.
The feast of fools.
Well, what are you waiting for?
Dig in!
But before we get to the main course...
You, Professor, tried to cheat me.
What?
What is he talking about?
A mistake for which you and your friends will pay!
It was not a mistake.
What are you talking about?
No?
Enlighten me.
You are a foul aberration,
A sick stench in the human mind.
You lure desperate people into your trap.
You prey on the weak, promising them strength, and then you take everything they have.
Do I know you?
You will.
Kinda makes me hungry.
Say it.
Say it now.
Say what?
Dinner time!
No!
No!
[screaming]
Aah!
Why aren't you doing anything?
Ah, you...
Aah!
[grunting]
Hah!
Ha ha!
Come on.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
No!
Ha ha ha!
[laughing]
Ooh.
Punchy!
You fat blundering idiot!
Destroy him!
Punchy, now remember what we talked about.
There is no reason you have to take this abuse from him.
"Aboose"?
He has to take whatever abuse I give him!
Punchy, listen to me.
These are nothing but rules.
He doesn't have any real control over you.
Me crush you.
No, Punchy, no!
I am the boss!
Raah!
[growling]
What the hell are you doing?
Why don't you say his name?
Yaah!
He already killed Rojer and Erica!
Uhhn!
Hah!
Ha ha ha ha ha!
Ha!
There's the mirror.
Aah!
No one's going anywhere!
It's time for dessert!
The only way you're getting out of here is inside of me!
Feardarig!
Feardarig!
That is your true name.
I have many names!
And this book contains them all!
Red Cap!
Loki!
Manthu!
I command you!
I control you!
I am the father of one of your victims...
One of the people that called you from the depths,
You tricked me.
You used these kids to distract me, to weaken me,
To exact your plan of revenge.
Ha ha ha!
What?
Professor, is that true?
Careful.
When hunting monsters, you may become one yourself.
I know what I am!
You sold us out!
I'm doing what has to be done!
It's so devious.
I'm proud of you.
I was the object of your revenge.
I was the one!
Imagine that.
Ow!
All this time it was me.
Shut up!
Why... here's the part you don't want to hear.
The fatal flaw in your little plan!
You see, you're right.
[panting]
I am a part of you... aah...
And you are all a part of me!
I said shut up!
Aah!
Your son is a part of me!
How will you avenge him?
[Young man's voice, echoing] Good to finally meet you, Dad.
No.
It's me...
Michael.
The son you never met.
Michael?
That can't be you.
Dad, we all become Killjoy.
When we call on him for vengeance, we become part of him.
Soon you'll join us.
Dad, soon we'll be together.
I have power over you.
Is my name in the book?
Does it say Michael in there?
You see, we create these demons.
Welcome to the family.
Fucker!
[laughing]
What the fuck?
He's a clown.
Laugh.
He's a clown.
Laugh.
[groaning]
What are you laughing at?
Hoo!
Aah!
[barking, growling]
Gotcha!
[laughing]
Stop that!
I still have the Professor's soul.
I can live.
Feardarig!
Your name is Feardarig!
[laughing]
No.
Mirror, mirror, on the wall.
No!
No!
Oh, no.
[laughing]
[laughing]
She hasn't stopped laughing yet.
And what about her friends?
The police are still trying to get her to say where she dumped the bodies.
We can help her.
We can stop the laughing.
Intro
Fear of a Blank Planet
Sunlight coming through the haze.
No gaps in the blind to let it inside.
The bed is unmade.
Some music still plays.
Tv, yeah it's always on, The flicker of the screen.
A movie actress screams.
I'm basking in the shit flowing out of it.
I'm stoned in the mall again.
Terminally bored shuffling round the stores
And shoplifting is getting so last year's thing.
X-box is a god to me.
A finger on the switch.
My mother is a bitch, My father gave up ever trying to talk to me.
Don't try engaging me.
The vaguest of shrugs.
The prescription drugs You'll never find a person inside.
My face is mogadon.
Curiosity?
Has given up on me.
I'm tuning out desires, The pills are on the rise.
How can be sure i'm here?
The pills that i've been taking confuse me.
I need to know that someone sees that There's nothing left i simply am not here.
I'm through with pornography.
The acting is lame
The action is tame Explicitly dull arousal annulled.
Your mouth should be boarded up Talking all day with nothing to say.
Your shallow proclamations All misinformation.
My friend says he wants to die.
He's in a band they sound like Pearl Jam.
The clothes are all black, The music is crap.
In school i don't concentrate And sex is kinda fun,
But just another one of all The empty ways of using up a day.
How can be sure i'm here?
The pills that i've been taking confuse me.
I need to know that someone sees that There's nothing left i simply am not here.
Bipolar disorder can't deal with the boredom.
Bipolar disorder can't deal with the boredom.
You don't try to be liked, You don't mind.
You feel no sun.
You steal a gun to kill time.
You're somewhere, you're nowhere.
You don't care.
You catch the breeze.
You still the leaves.
So now where?
My Ashes
All the things that I needed Wasted my chances
I have found myself wanting
When a mother and father Gave me their problems
I accepted them all
Nothing ever expected I was rejected
But I came back for more
And my ashes drift beneath the silver sky Where a boy rides on a bike and never smiles
And my ashes fall over all the things we've said On a box of photographs under the bed
I will stay in my own world Under the covers
I will feel safe inside
The kiss that will burn me Cure me of dreaming
I was always returning
And my ashes find a way beyond the fog And return to save the child that I forgot
And my ashes fade among the things unseen And a dream plays in reverse on piano keys
And my ashes drop upon a park in Wales Never-ending clouds of rain, and distant sails
Distant sails
Sails
Anesthetize
A good impression of myself Not much to conceal
I'm saying nothing But I'm saying nothing with feel
I simply am not here no way I...
Shut up be happy stop whining please
And because of who we are We react in mock surprise
The curse of "there must be more" So don't breathe here, don't leave your bags
I simply am not here no way I...
Shut up be happy stop whining please
The dust in my soul makes me feel the weight in my legs
My head in the clouds and I'm zoning out
I'm watching TV but I find it hard to stay conscious
I'm totally bored but I can't switch off
Only apathy from the pills in me It's all in me, all in you
Electricity from the pills in me It's all in me, all in you
Only MTV and cod philosophy
We're lost in the mall, shuffling through the stores like zombies
Well what is the point?
What can money buy?
My hands on a gun and I find the range, God tempt me
Well what did you say?
Think I'm passing out
Only apathy from the pills in me It's all in me, all in you
Electricity from the pills in me It's all in me, all in you
Only MTV and cod philosophy
Only apathy from the pills in me It's all in me, all in you
Electricity from the pills in me It's all in me, all in you
Only MTV and cod philosophy
Water so warm that day
I counted out the waves
As they broke into surf I smiled into the sun
The water so warm that day I was counting out the waves
And I followed their short life As they broke on the shoreline
I could see you But I couldn't hear you
You were holding your hat in the breeze Turning away from me
In this moment you were stolen There's black across the sun
Water so warm that day
I counted out the waves
As they broke into surf I smiled into the sun
Sentimental
I never want to be old And I don't want dependence
It's no fun to be told That you can't blame your parents anymore
I'm finding it hard To hang from a star
I don't want to be Never want to be old
Sullen and bored the kids stay And in this way wish away each day
Stoned in the mall the kids play And in this way wish away each day
I don't really know If I care what is normal
And I'm not really sure If the pills I've been taking are helping
I've wasted my life And I'm hurting inside
I don't really know And I'm not really sure
Sullen and bored the kids stay And in this way wish away each day
Stoned in the mall the kids play And in this way wish away each day
Sullen and bored the kids stay And in this way wish away each day
Stoned in the mall the kids play And in this way wish away each day
Sullen and bored the kids stay And in this way wish away each day
Stoned in the mall the kids play And in this way wish away each day
Way Out of Here
Out at the train tracks I dream of escape
But a song comes onto my ipod And I realise it's getting late
I can't take the staring and the sympathy
And I don't like the questions:
"How do you feel?"
"How's it going in school?" "Do you wanna talk about it?"
Way out Way out of here
Fade out Fade out, vanish
I'll try to forget you And I know that I will
In a thousand years Or maybe a week
I'll burn all your pictures Cut out your face
And the shutters a down and the curtains are closed
And I've covered my tracks Disposed of the car
And I'll try to forget even your name And the way that you look when you're sleeping And dreaming of this
Way out Way out of here
Fade out Fade out, vanish
Way out Way out of here
Fade out Fade out, vanish
Sleep Together
This means out
This is your way out
Do or drown
Do or drown in torpor
Leave no trace
All my files erased
Burn my clothes
Burn my Prada trainers
Let's sleep together Right now
Relieve the pressure Somehow
Switch off the future Right now
Let's sleep forever
This is fate
This is your escape
Leave here now
Leave here, like it's alright
Let's sleep together Right now
Relieve the pressure Somehow
Switch off the future Right now
Let's sleep forever
What Happens Now?
So I got all these things, but so what?
In the end you can't take them with you
You think you can save my soul?
Well OK
Tell me, with all your conviction
What happens now?
What happens now?
Well I could be boarding an aircraft
With a bomb concealed in somebody's briefcase
And my body will spread through the heavens, across the sky
And my ashes will fall through the cloudburst
What happens now?
What happens now?
What happens now?
What happens now?
Normal
Here is my car, my phone and my TV
I've got it all but you can see through me
But am I here?
It's kind of hard to tell
I do a good impression of myself
But what's normal now anyhow?
Sullen and bored the kids stay And in this way they wish away each day
Stoned in the mall the kids play And in this way they wish away each day
Prescription drugs they help me through the day
And that restraining order keeps me well at bay
But what's normal now anyway?
Sullen and bored the kids stay And in this way they wish away each day
Stoned in the mall the kids play And in this way they wish away each day
Sullen and bored the kids stay And in this way they wish away each day
Stoned in the mall the kids play And in this way they wish away each day
Wish I was old and a little sentimental
Wish I was old and a little sentimental (You gotta see the waves, not the wine bottle)
Wish I was old and a little sentimental
Wish I was old and a little sentimental (You gotta see the waves, not the wine bottle)
Dark Matter
Inside the vehicle the cold is extreme
Smoke in my throat kicks me out of my dream
I try to relax but its warmer outside
I fail to connect, it's a tragic divide
This has become a full time career
To die young would take only 21 years
Gun down a school or blow up a car
The media circus will make you a star
Crushed like a rose In the river flow
I am I know
I am I know
Dark matter flowing out on to a tape
Is only as loud as the silence it breaks
Most things decay in a matter of days
The product is sold the memory fades
Crushed like a rose In the river flow
I am I know
I am I know
Drown With Me
So you have been of use And you have been abused
You know you look pale today Your lipstick has gone astray
You sold out and lost your looks You gave away all your books
You should drown with me
Your coil has been wound up tight Unwind it with me tonight
You should drown with me
Tyre tracks Fresh on the ground Where she will be found
Resting there in a stream Buried in green
Orange filter sky
Your drowning in family there When will you come up for air
You should drown with me
Don't feel you let 'em down Cos they have already drowned
You should drown with me
Tyre tracks Fresh in the ground Where she will be found
Resting there in a stream Buried in green
Orange filter sky
You should drown with me
You should drown with me
Lying through my teeth again I've been bad again, black lies
Skirting round the truth again To escape the look in your eyes
Cover up the facts again With the money men, disguise
Losing my integrity Well it's lost to me, I don't mind
Feel my soul going Feel my soul colder
Blackening my soul again With another lie, it's my style
Burying my face again God I'm so ashamed, this time
Feel my soul going Feel my soul colder
Feel my soul going Feel my soul colder
Half-Light
Such a pale light
Such a long night

Wedding Nails
Strip the Soul
This is my home, this is my own, we don't like no strangers
Raise the kids good, beat the kids good and tie them up
Spread it wide, my wife, my life, push the camera deeper
I can use, I abuse, my muse, I made them all
This machine Is there to please
Strip the soul Fill the hole
A fire to feed A belt to bleed
Strip the soul Kill them all
They are not gone, they are not gone, they are only sleeping
In graves, in ways, in clay, underneath the floor
Building walls, overalls, getting bored, I got faulty wiring
Brick it up now, brick it up now, but keep the bones
This machine Is there to please
Strip the soul Fill the hole
A fire to feed A belt to bleed
Strip the soul Kill them all
This machine Is there to please
Strip the soul Fill the hole

The Sleep of No Dreaming
At the age of sixteen I grew out of hope
I regarded the cosmos Through a circle of rope
So I threw out my plans Ran on to the wheel
And emptied my head Of all childish ideals
The sleep of no dreaming The sleep of no feeling
The sleep of no feeling The sleep of no dreaming
I married the first girl Who wasn't a man
And smiled as the spiders Ran all over my hands
The sleep of no dreaming The sleep of no feeling
The sleep of no feeling The sleep of no dreaming
Made a good living By dying it's true
As the world in my TV Leaked onto my shoes
The sleep of no dreaming The sleep of no feeling
The sleep of no feeling The sleep of no dreaming
The sleep of no dreaming The sleep of no feeling
The sleep of no feeling The sleep of no dreaming

Good afternoon.
In the last several minutes,
KOB has received dozens of reports of what appears to be a crashed aircraft, possibly two aircraft...
on Albuquerque's east side.
As of yet, details are scarce, but callers describe witnessing an explosion overhead, followed by falling debris.
... crash investigators with the National Transportation Safety Board are expected on-site as early as this evening.
But officials warn that, with a debris field of this magnitude, the investigation and the clean-up may well stretch the Boeing 737 was being re-routed or vectored through the airspace, which is standard procedure, according to a spokesman for the FAA.
The eight-seat King Air 350 was a charter flight operating out of Saint George, Utah, bound for Amarillo, Texas.
It sounded like hail.
Like heavy hailstones.
It was just... bump-bump-bump all over the neighborhood.
... indicating that the final death toll now stands at 167.
... 167.
This mid-air collision has left many wondering how such an accident could take place in a system with so many safeguards.
Allegations continue that the collision which brought down Flight 515 was caused by improper air traffic control.
The bombshell confirmation out of Oklahoma City today, as the FAA confirmed, it was, indeed, a lone air traffic controller's fateful mistake is Donald Margolis, a 19-year veteran of the FAA's
Air Route Traffic Control Center in Albuquerque.
... Margolis recently returned to work after a five-week absence, which was due to, quote, "a personal loss".
While it's now known that Margolis had recently lost a daughter to a drug overdose a month before.
His troubled daughter Jane Margolis, aged 26, apparently had a long history of substance abuse.
Friends of the family say the death of his only child hit Margolis particularly hard.
Coming as it did little more than a month before, many are questioning the timing of his return to work, and are wondering how much blame truly lies with those who let this grieving father...
{pos(192,205)}I usually open
{pos(192,205)}with "So sorry you're here."
{pos(192,205)}Where would you like to begin?
{pos(192,205)}I really just need this
{pos(192,205)}quick and easy, you know?
As quick as... {pos(192,205)}something like this can be.
{pos(192,180)}Is that mutual?
Does your husband go along with that?
{pos(192,205)}Does he know?
{pos(192,205)}I mean, he certainly knows we're separated, so... {pos(192,205)}Has he moved out?
{pos(192,205)}We're in the process of moving him out.
Yeah.
Today, hopefully.
{pos(192,205)}And in the meantime, my... {pos(192,205)}my son and my daughter and I are staying with my sister.
So you've moved out?
{pos(192,205)}Yes, just temporarily, only so he could get his things.
{pos(192,205)}That was supposed to happen last week,
{pos(192,205)}but then came the crash, and... {pos(192,205)}
- God.
You weren't one of the...
- Right...
Right beneath the flight path.
We had debris land in our yard
- and all of our neighborhood, so...
- Terrible.
Apparently, even... you know, parts of bodies, and so...
I certainly couldn't bring myself to...
- So awful.
- I know.
Anyway, I was certainly not ready to move back, but it's time.
And...
I'm sure we're driving my sister and her husband up a wall.
{pos(192,205)}You definitely want to maintain residency
{pos(192,205)}in your actual home.
{pos(192,205)}It just puts you in a better position in regards to custody.
{pos(192,205)}Two children?
{pos(192,205)}Holly here, and then I have a son
{pos(192,205)}in high school... {pos(192,205)}Walter Junior.
{pos(192,205)}They need to stay with me.
{pos(192,205)}
- How long have you been married?
- Sixteen years.
{pos(192,205)}And it's not an apartment.
It's a house that you live in?
Do you own outright?
Do you have a mortgage?
There's definitely a mortgage.
We have... maybe 15 years on it.
What about other debts or assets?
Do you feel you have a good understanding of you and your husband's financial situation?
- Is your husband employed?
- Here's the thing.
I'm really not looking for any, sort of... loopholes or...
- I don't know... just...
- No.
No loopholes.
I just intend that every one of my clients get a full and honest accounting of what it is they owe and what it is they own.
To that end, I say let's leave no stone unturned.
You'd be amazed what I've seen partners hide from one another.
There you are.
Listen, I...
You know, well...
It's...
It's time.
The shittiest week since 9/11, okay?
Bar none.
Yeah, this is it.
Hands down, we're living it.
I speak with some authority because we had some shitty weeks in the past few months.
But this here, call, you know... call freakin' the Guinness Book of World Records...
Call freakin'...
Am I talking too much?
I am, right?
I am.
I know.
Look.
But this situation between you and...
I'm not asking, by the way.
It's none of my business.
I do not want to get in the middle.
I'm just saying...
Listen, okay?
You beat a little tactical retreat.
And regroup.
And then... bong.
Absence makes the...
I'm pulling for you.
- No heavy lifting.
I got it.
- No, it's okay.
I got it.
Jesus.
What do you got in there, cinder blocks?
Half a million in cash.
That's the spirit.
I got it.
I got it.
Who's here for self-improvement?
Come on, give me a show of hands.
Who among you is here hoping they can actively improve who they are?
Right.
See, that's your first mistake.
You should be here to learn self-acceptance.
Honey, you...
You want another waffle?
I still got the iron out.
I could cut up some bananas.
Hi, you're reached Walt, Skyler, Flynn, and Holly.
Please leave us a message.
Hey.
Hello, everybody.
Good morning.
I was just checking in and thought I'd pass along the current contact information.
I mean, certainly, you can always reach me on my cell.
I've always got that on me.
But in terms of... a mailing address,
I'm here at The Beachcomber.
And you know what?
It's actually very nice.
It's very pleasant.
Not as high end as the Oakwood, but, you know, not as corporate...
Would you please just...
Hey, Dad.
It's me.
No, I'm not okay.
I don't know what the hell is going on.
Nobody's telling me jack shit.
Flynn.
Whatever.
I don't even care anymore.
Can you just give me a ride to school?
I'll take you to school.
Yeah.
No.
I'm ready now.
Flynn, I'm taking you to school.
All right.
I'm here.
See you soon.
May I have your attention, please?
As all of you know, last week our city suffered a terrible tragedy, one that none of us will ever forget, which is why today we're going to take a little time out of our schedule to gather in the gym and talk.
I just find it, you know, really... really hard to concentrate
because of all the horrors, you know, we perceived.
It just really gets inside your brain, and...
In college they have this thing where, if your roommate kills himself... like, if you come home and find him hanging in the closet or whatever... it's basically, like, an automatic "A"
for you.
And I just think that that kind of compassion is...
- Okay.
- is something to...
Thank you, Barry.
Who wants to go next?
No judgments, guys.
Just feelings.
You can say anything and everything that's on your mind.
Anyone?
There you go, honey.
I just keep asking myself...
Honey, could you please stand up?
Just keep asking myself, "Why did this happen?"
I mean, if there's a God and all, why does he allow all those innocent people to die for no reason?
Can we just keep it secular, honey?
Anyhow, I haven't really been sleeping much.
Does anyone else have that?
I just keep hearing that... that sound.
That... boom.
It just plays over and over in my head like it won't ever stop.
Thank you, sweetheart.
Is there anyone else?
Over here.
My neighbor, he heard the crash, and he ran outside, and he found, like, this seat... like an airline seat.
Like one you have on an airliner?
Anyway, the seat was standing perfectly upright in his front yard, right next to his Sea-Doos... because, like, he has Sea-Doos...
But... there was still a pair of legs buckled into them.
Human legs.
Jesus H. Christ.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
Sorry.
I was just moved.
Maybe we should hear from the faculty.
Certainly this tragedy didn't only affect our students.
Mr. White, would you like to say something?
And by the way, welcome back.
It's so good to have you back.
I guess what I would...
Sorry.
Sorry.
I guess what I would want to say is... to look on the bright side.
First of all, nobody on the ground was killed.
And that...
An incident like this over a populated urban center...
That right there, that's just gotta be some minor miracle, so...
Plus... neither plane was full.
You know, the 737 was...
Was what?
Maybe two-thirds full, I believe.
Right?
Yes?
Or maybe even three-quarters full.
At any rate, what you're left with casualty-wise is
just the 50th worst air disaster.
Actually, tied for 50th.
There are, in truth, fifty-three
crashes throughout history that are just as bad or worse...
Tenerife?
Has anybody hear of Tenerife?
In 1977, two fully loaded 747s crashed into each other on Tenerife.
Does anybody know how big a 747 is?
It's way bigger than a 737.
And we're talking about two of them.
Nearly 600 people died on Tenerife.
Doesn't any of you even remember it at all?
Any of you?
I doubt it.
You know why?
It's because... people move on.
They just move on.
And we will, too.
We will move on, and we will get past this because that is what human beings do.
We survive.
And...
We survive, and we...
We overcome.
We survive.
We survive, and...
Thank you.
Good.
How's your Aunt Marie doing?
Fine,
I guess.
You make sure you say hello to her for me, will you?
Why don't you just come inside?
It's your house.
No, I...
He's gone.
Hey, Flynn!
- How's tricks?
- What?
Tricks.
It's an expression.
How are you?
Why do you gotta treat him like this?
Why you gotta be like this?
Why can't you just talk, even?
Cool down.
Out of the mouths of babes.
Try not to hold it against him.
I mean, the poor kid, he's probably just dying of curiosity.
And I guess it would be natural for him to wonder.
He's probably just wondering what is it that could have gone so wrong...
- Marie.
- ... that my mother would leave...
I can't help you get through this, Skyler, you know, if you won't tell me what it is that Walt did.
You know what?
I don't remember asking you, all right?
So if you want to be supportive, you could be supportive without prying, that would be really great... and so... helpful.
It's that... voice inside your head.
It's that sneaky, rat-bastard, 24/7 voice.
You guys know what I'm talking about.
It tells you you're not good enough.
Not good enough for what?
Not good enough to... be what, President of the United States?
Okay, so maybe you're not that good.
But now, are you good enough to deserve your share of basic human happiness?
Are you good enough to be okay with who and what you are?
I say yes.
But it doesn't matter what I say.
It's your voice, which means you're the only one that hears it, which means that you're the only one that can fight it.
Right?
Jesse... we never hear from you.
What's going on?
You can tell me I'm full of shit.
It's okay.
I don't mind.
Just...
Come on.
Let us in on it.
So, like, what makes you the expert?
I don't think I ever said I was that.
Yeah, but you're the one sitting here, right?
Telling us thus and so, be happy, forgive yourself,
Have you ever really hurt anybody?
I don't just mean disappointed your mother or whatever, but did you... ever really... hurt someone?
I killed my daughter.
It was July 18th... which is my birthday.
July 18th, 1992.
I was... high on cocaine, and I was drunk.
Cocaine wasn't an issue because I had bought myself 2 grams the night before as a birthday present.
I had plenty left.
But I was out of vodka.
And this is in Portsmouth, Virginia, where instead of selling liquor in the supermarkets, they have these ABC stores which close at 5 p.m.
And right then it was, like, 4:42.
So I'm arguing with my wife...
"Come on, go to the ABC for me.
"It's my birthday.
"Come on.
"They're not gonna sell it to me."
She's saying, "No, no."
So I'm pissed, and the clock is ticking, so I jump in my truck.
She's... my 6-year-old daughter...
She's playing at the end of the driveway.
How do you not hate yourself?
I did hate myself... for a long time.
But it didn't stop me from... drinking and getting high.
It just made it that much worse.
Self-hatred, guilt, it accomplishes nothing.
It just stands in the way.
Stands in the way of what?
True change.
Is this a good time to talk?
Yeah.
Come in, please.
Do you want to start?
Why are you doing this?
Why are you even thinking this way?
Is it to punish me?
- I am not punishing you, Walt.
- This is punitive is what this is.
We are happily married.
I am happily married.
I am happy.
We're just...
I love you, and I would do anything for you.
Would you even consider...
I mean, Jesus!
You come in here, and you wave these papers in my face, when there's a whole other entire side to this thing.
There's your side, and there's my side.
And you haven't heard my side yet.
- You haven't heard any of it at all.
- You're a drug dealer.
How else could you possibly make that kind of money?
Marijuana.
That Pinkman kid.
Cocaine?
It's methamphetamine.
But I'm...
I manufacture.
I am not a dealer.
Per se.
It doesn't mean...
No, Skyler.
Listen to me.
There are a lot of angles to this, okay?
It's complicated.
All right?
So please, let's...
Please, let's just sit back down, and we'll talk it through.
I'm gonna make you a deal, Walt.
I won't tell Hank, and I won't tell your children or anybody else.
Nobody will hear it from me, but only if you grant me this divorce and stay out of our lives.
I mean it.
Now let me out of here before I throw up.
Your windshield's broken.
Yep.
A little friction in the marriage right now.
Strictly temporary.
We're just... just taking a little break.
That's you over there.
Listen, money.
Saul has got it for you,
- so as soon as you're feeling better...
- I'm better.
You're better.
Really?
What?
The rehab?
It helped?
Yeah.
I'm done using.
That's excellent.
That's...
That's very good, Jesse.
Boy...
Very good.
You know, um... in spite of how bad things got, it really could be looked at like a wake-up call for both of us.
You know, just to get our... our lives back together again
and on the straight and narrow.
You been following this airplane crash?
Yeah.
You know it was
Jane's dad who accidentally crashed them together?
Because he was so torn up?
Let me stop you right there, all right?
You are not responsible for this... not in any way, shape, or form, all right?
Now, I am very up-to-date on this thing, probably far more than you are, and there are... there are... many factors at play there.
Yeah?
For instance, there's some sort of collision radar on the jet that may not have been working properly.
That's public record.
You can look that up.
And the whole system is run on... on 1960s technology.
No.
No, really...
I blame the government.
You either run from things, or you face them, Mr. White.
And what exactly does that mean?
I learned it in rehab.
It's all about accepting who you really are.
I accept who I am.
And who are you?
I'm the bad guy.
Is the food to your satisfaction?
Very much.
It's good to see you again.
May I?
I have an offer that I think will be of interest to you.
I actually... am not here to...
I'm here because I owe you the courtesy and respect to tell you this personally.
I'm done.
It has nothing to do with you personally.
I find you extraordinarily professional, and I appreciate the way you do business.
I'm just... making a change in my life is what it is, and I'm...
I'm at some...
something of a crossroads.
It has... brought me to a realization.
I am not a criminal.
No offense to any people who are.
But... this is not me.
I'd like you to hear my offer, notwithstanding.
It won't change my mind.
I'm sorry.
$3 million for three months of your time.
Three months, then out.
3 million?
May I take this as a yes?
I have money.
I have more money than I know how to spend.
What I don't have is my family.
The answer is still no.
Enjoy your meal.
Thank you.
What the hell is going on?
[clucking] [squawks]

[Woman] I usually open with "So sorry you're here."
Where would you like to begin?
I really just need this quick and easy, you know?
As quick as something like this can be.
Okay.
Is that mutual?

Well, I mean, he certainly knows we're separated, so--

Two children, you said?
Yes.
Holly here, and then I have a son in high school--
Walter Junior.
They need to stay with me.
Okay.
How long have you been married?
Sixteen years.
And it's not an apartment.
It's a house that you live in?
Mm-hmm.
Do you own outright?
Do you have a mortgage?
Yes.
There's definitely a mortgage.
We have, um... maybe 15 years on it.
What about other debts or assets?
Do you feel you have a good understanding of you and your husband's financial situation?

Whoa, whoa.

No, it's okay.

What do you got in there, cinder blocks?
Half a million in cash.
That's the spirit.

I got it.

Whoo.

I could cut up some bananas. [ring] [answering machine clicks]
[Skyler's voice] Hi, you're reached Walt, Skyler, Flynn, and Holly.
Please leave us a message.
[beeps]
[Walt] Uh, hey.
Hello, everybody.
Good morning.
I was just checking in and thought I'd pass along the current contact information.
I mean, certainly, you can always reach me on my cell.
I've always got that on me.
But in terms of a mailing address,
I'm here at The Beachcomber.
And you know what?
It's actually very nice.
It's very pleasant.
Not as high end as the Oakwood, but, you know, not as corporate--
Oh, hey, would you please just- [receiver clatters]
[Walter Junior] Hey, Dad.
It's me.
No, I'm not okay.
I don't know what the h- -- is going on.
Nobody's telling me jack s- -- around here.
Hey, Flynn.
What-
- Whatever.
I-
- I don't even care anymore.
Can-
- Can you just give me a ride to school?
I'll take you to school.
Yeah.
No.
I-
- I'm ready now.
Flynn, I'm taking you to school.
All right.
I'm here.
See you soon.

[Woman on P.A.] May I have your attention, please?
As all of you know, last week our city suffered a terrible tragedy, one that none of us will ever forget, which is why today we're going to take a little time out of our schedule to gather in the gym and talk.
I just find it, you know, really-- really hard to concentrate because of all the horrors, you know, we perceived.
It just really gets inside your brain, and--
In college they have this thing where, if your roommate kills himself-- like, if you come home and find him hanging in the closet or whatever-- it's basically, like, an automatic "A" for you.
And I just think that that kind of compassion is-- is something to-
- Okay.
Thank you, Barry.
Who wants to go next?
Hmm?
No judgments, guys.
Just feelings.
You can say anything and everything that's on your mind.
Anyone?
There you go, honey.
I just keep asking myself--
Honey, could you please stand up?
Just keep asking myself, "Why did this happen?"
I mean, if there's a God and all, why does he allow all those innocent people to die for no reason?
Okay, can we just keep it secular, honey?
Anyhow, I haven't really been sleeping much.
Does anyone else have that?
I just keep hearing that- that sound.
That boom.
It just plays over and over in my head like it won't ever stop.
[Woman] Thank you, sweetheart.
Is there anyone else?
Uh-- [clears throat]--
My neighbor, he heard the crash, and he ran out to his front yard, and he found, like, this seat-- you know, like, an airline seat.
Like one you have on an airliner?
Well, anyway, the seat was standing perfectly upright in his front yard, right next to his Sea-Doos-- because, like, he has Sea-Doos--
But... there was still a pair of legs buckled into them.
Human legs.
J---
- H. C-----.
[whispers] You okay?
Yeah.
Sorry.
I-- um--
I was just moved.
[Woman] Maybe we should hear from the faculty.
Certainly this tragedy didn't only affect our students.
Mr. White, would you like to say something?
And by the way, welcome back.
Hmm?
[applause]
It's so good to have you back.
[mutters]
Uh...
I guess what I-
- I would--
Sorry.
Sorry.
I guess what I would want to say is... to look on the bright side.
First of all, nobody on the ground was killed.
And that-
- I mean, an incident like this over a populated urban center--
That right there, that's-- that's just gotta be some minor miracle, so--
Plus, neither plane was full.
You know, the-- the 737 was-- was what?
Uh, maybe two-thirds full, I believe.
Right?
Yes?
Or maybe even three-quarters full.
Well, at any rate, what you're left with casualty-wise is just the 50th worst air disaster.
Actually, tied for 50th.
There are, in truth, 53 crashes throughout history that are just as bad or worse--
Tenerife?
Has anybody-- anybody hear of Tenerife?
No?
In 1977, two fully loaded 747s crashed into each other on Tenerife.
Does anybody know how big a 747 is?
I mean, it's way bigger than a 737.
And we're talking about two of them.
Nearly 600 people died on Tenerife.
Doesn't any of you even remember it at all?
Any of you?
I doubt it.
You know why?
It's because... people move on.
They just move on.
And we will, too.
We will move on, and we will get past this because that is what human beings do.
We survive.
And, uh...
We survive, and-- and we-- we overcome.
Yeah.
We survive.
We survive, and--
Thank you.
Okay.
Thank you. [feedback]
Good.
Well...
Hey, how's your Aunt Marie doing?
Fine, I guess.
Oh.
You make sure you say hello to her for me, will you?
Why don't you just come inside?
It's your house.
No, I--
[door closes] [engine starts]
He's gone.
[Marie] Hey, Flynn!
Tricks.
It's an expression.
How are you?
Why do you gotta treat him like this?
Why you gotta be like this?
Why can't you just talk, even?
Hey, hey, hey.
Cool down.
Okay.
Okay.
Out of the mouths of babes, huh?
[door slams] [whispers] Wow.
You know, try not to hold it against him.
You know, I mean, the poor kid, he's probably just dying of curiosity.
You know, and I guess it would be natural for him to wonder.
I mean, he's probably just wondering, you know, what is it that could have gone so wrong-
- Marie.
...that my mother would leave-
- Marie.
I can't help you get through this, Skyler, you know, if you won't tell me what it is that Walt did.
Well, you know what?
I don't-
- I don't remember asking you, all right?
Well, I think that's- So if you want to be supportive, ...the reason you're stuck.
you could be supportive without prying, that would be really great- Prying, okay.
...and so-
- Well, prying's a strong word, but I don't-- ...helpful.
[Man] It's that... voice inside your head.
It's that sneaky, rat-bastard, 24/7 voice.
You guys know what I'm talking about.
That voice that tells you you're not good enough.
Not good enough for what?
Not good enough to... be what, President of the United States?
Well, okay, so maybe you're not that good.
But now are you good enough to deserve your share of basic human happiness?
Are you good enough to be okay with who and what you are?
I say yes.
But it doesn't matter what I say.
It's your voice, which means you're the only one that hears it, which means that you're the only one that can fight it.
Right?
Jesse... we never hear from you.
What's going on?
You can tell me I'm full of s---.
It's okay.
I don't mind.
Just-
- Come on.
Let us in on it.
So, like, what makes you the expert?
I don't think I ever said I was that.
Yeah, but you're the one sitting here, right?
Telling us thus and so, be happy, forgive yourself, blah, blah, blah.
Have you ever really hurt anybody?
I don't just mean disappointed your mother or whatever, but did you... ever really... hurt someone?
I killed my daughter.
It was July 18... which is my birthday.
July 18, 1992.
I was high on cocaine, and I was drunk.
Cocaine wasn't an issue because I had bought myself 2 grams the night before as a birthday present.
I had plenty left.
But I was out of vodka.
And this is in Portsmouth, Virginia, where instead of selling liquor in the supermarkets, they have these ABC stores which close at 5 p.m.
And right then it was, like, 4:42.
So I'm arguing with my wife--
"Come on, go to the ABC for me.
"It's my birthday.
"Come on.
They're not gonna sell it to me."
She's saying, "No, no."
So I'm p---ed, and the clock is ticking, so I jump in my truck.
She's-- my 6-year-old daughter...
She's playing at the end of the driveway.
So...
How do you not hate yourself?
I did hate myself... for a long time.
But it didn't stop me from... drinking and getting high.
It just made it that much worse.
Self-hatred, guilt, it accomplishes nothing.
It just stands in the way.
Stands in the way of what?
True change.
[knocking on door]
[coughs]
Skyler, hi.
Is this a good time to talk?
Yeah.
Come in, please.
Skyler.
Um...
Do you want to start?
Okay.
Why-
- Why are you doing this?
Why are you even thinking this way?
Is it to punish me?
I am not punishing you, Walt.
This is punitive is what this is.
We are happily married.
[exhales] I am happily married.
I am happy.
We're just--
I love you, Skyler, and I would do anything for you.
Would you even consider--
I mean, J----!
You come in here, and you wave these papers in my face, when there's a whole other entire side to this thing.
There's your side, and there's my side.
And you haven't heard my side yet.
You haven't heard any of it at all.
You're a drug dealer.
No.
What-
- How--
What?
[inhales, exhales]
Yeah.
How else could you possibly make that kind of money?
Marijuana.
That Pinkman kid.
No?
Oh, my God, Walt.
Cocaine?
It's methamphetamine.
But I-
- I'm--
I manufacture.
I am not a dealer.
Oh.
Per se.
It doesn't-- [gasps]
No, Skyler.
Listen to me, Skyler.
No.
Listen.
No.
There are a lot of angles to this, okay?
It's complicated, all right?
So please, let's--
Please, let's just sit back down, and we'll talk it through.
I'm gonna make you a deal, Walt.
I won't tell Hank, and I won't tell your children or anybody else.
Nobody will hear it from me, but only if you grant me this divorce and stay out of our lives.
No, Skyler.
I mean it.
Now let me the h-- out of here before I throw up.
Your windshield's broken.
Yep.
A little friction in the marriage right now.
Strictly temporary.
We're just-- just taking a little break.
Uh, that's you over there.
Listen, um, money.
Saul has got it for you, and so as so as you're feeling better--
I'm better.
You're better.
Really?
What?
The rehab?
It helped?
Yeah.
I'm done using.
That's excellent.
That's--
That's very good, Jesse.
Boy-
- Very good.
You know, um... in spite of how bad things got, it really could be looked at like a wake-up call for th of us.
I mean, you know, just to get our-- our lives back together again and on the straight and narrow.
You been following this airplane crash?
Yeah.
You know it was Jane's dad who accidentally crashed them together?
Because he was so torn up?
Okay, look, let me stop you right there, all right?
You are not responsible for this-- not in any way, shape, or form, all right?
Now, I-
- I am very up-to-date on this thing, probably far more than you are, and there are-- there are many factors at play there.
Yeah?
For instance, there's some sort of collision radar on the jet that may not have been working properly.
Now, that's public record.
You can look that up.
And the whole system is run on-- on 1960s technology.
No.
No, really...
I blame the government.
You either run from things, or you face them, Mr. White.
And what exactly does that mean?
I learned it in rehab.
It's all about accepting who you really are.
I accept who I am.
And who are you?
I'm the bad guy.
Is the food to your satisfaction?
Very much.
It's good to see you again.
May I?
I have an offer that I think will be of interest to you.
I actually am not here to--
I'm here because I owe you the courtesy and respect to tell you this personally.
I'm done.
It has nothing to do with you personally.
I find you extraordinarily professional, and I appreciate the way you do business.
I'm just... making a change in my life is what it is, and I'm--
I'm at some- something of a crossroads.
It has brought me to a realization.
I am not a criminal.
No offense to any people who are.
But... this is not me.
I'd like you to hear my offer, notwithstanding.
It won't change my mind.
I'm sorry.
$3 million for three months of your time.
Three months, then out.
3 million?
May I take this as a yes?
[sighs]
I have money.
I have more money than know how to spend.
What I don't have is my family.
The answer is still no.
Enjoy your meal.
Thank you.
[thumping]
[gunfire] [gunfire continues]
What the h--- is going on in there?
[gunfire]
[gunshot] [grunts]
[gunshot]
We interrupt scheduled programming to bring you this breaking news.
Good afternoon.
In the last several minutes KOB has received dozens of reports of what appears to be a crashed aircraft, possibly two aircraft on Albuquerque's east side.
As of yet details are scarce but callers describe witnessing an explosion overhead followed by falling debris.
Visible now Crash investigators with the National Transportation Safety Board are expected on site as early as this evening.
But officials warn that with a debris field of this magnitude, the investigation...
Officials are now saying that the Boeing 737 was being re-routed, or vectored, through the airspace which is standard procedure according to a spokesman for the FAA.
The eight-seat King Air 350 was a charter flight operating out of St. George, Utah, bound for Amarillo, Texas.
It sounded like hail, like heavy hailstones.
It was just bump-bump-bump, all over the neighbourhood Indicating that the final death toll now stands at 167.
...One hundred and sixty-seven.
This mid-air collision has left many wondering how such an accident could take place in a system with so many safeguards.
...That the collision which brought down Flight 515 was caused by improper air traffic control.
We have the bombshell confirmation out of Oklahoma City as the FAA confirmed it was indeed a lone air traffic controller's fateful mistake which brought about the crash.
...Is Donald Margolis, a 19-year veteran of the FAA's Air Route Traffic Control Center in Albuquerque Margolis recently returned to work after a five-week absence which was due to, quote, "a personal loss".
While it's now known that Margolis had recently lost a daughter to a Drug overdose a month before.
His troubled daughter Jane Margolis, aged 26 apparently had a long history of substance abuse.
Friends of the family say the death of his only child hit Margolis particularly hard.
Coming as it did little more than a month before many are questioning the timing of his return to work and are wondering how much blame truly lies with those who let this grieving father...
I usually open with "So sorry you're here."
Where would you like to begin?
I really just need this quick and easy, you know?
As quick as something like this can be.
So...
Okay.
Is that mutual?
Does your husband go along with that?
Does he know?
Well, I mean, he certainly knows we're separated, so...
Has he moved out?
We're in the process of moving him out.
Yeah.
Today, hopefully.
And in the meantime, my son and my daughter and I are staying with my sister.
- So you've moved out?
- Well, yes, just temporarily.
Only so he could get his things and...
That was supposed to happen last week, but then came the crash and...
Oh, God, you weren't one of the...?
Right, yeah.
Right beneath the flight path.
And we had debris land in our yard, and all over our neighbourhood, so...
- Terrible.
- Yeah.
Apparently, even you know, parts of bodies.
So I certainly couldn't bring myself to...
- So awful.
- I know.
Anyway, I was certainly not ready to move back.
But it's time.
And I'm sure we're driving my sister and her husband up a wall.
Well, you definitely wanna maintain residency in your actual home.
It just puts you in a better position in regards to custody.
Two children, you said?
Yes.
Holly here, and then I have a son in high school, Walter Jr.
- They need to stay with me.
- Okay.
- How long have you been married?
- Sixteen years.
And it's not an apartment, it's a house that you live in?
Do you own outright, do you have a mortgage...?
Yes, there's definitely a mortgage.
We have maybe 15 years on it.
What about other debts or assets?
Do you feel you have a good understanding of you and your husband's financial situation?
- Is your husband employed?
- Here's the thing.
I'm really not looking for any sort of loopholes...
- ...or I don't know, just...
- No, no loopholes.
I just intend that every one of my clients get a full and honest accounting of what it is they owe and what it is they own.
To that end, I say let's leave no stone unturned.
You'd be amazed what I've seen partners hide from one another.
Walt?
Hey, buddy?
Hey, Walt?
- Hey.
- There you are.
Listen, I...
You know, well...
It's...
It's time.
The shittiest week since 9/11, okay?
Bar none.
This is it.
Hands down, we're living it.
I speak with authority because we had some shitty weeks the past few months.
But this here?
I mean call freaking Guinness Book of World Records, call freaking...
Am I talking too much?
I am, right?
I am, I know.
But this situation between you and...
You know, I don't know.
I'm not asking, by the way.
It's none of my business.
I do not wanna get in the middle of you two.
I'm just saying, listen, okay?
You beat a little tactical retreat you regroup, and then:
You know, absence makes the...
Yeah.
I'm pulling for you, man.
I'm pulling for you.
- No heavy lifting.
I got it.
- No, it's okay.
I got it.
Jesus.
What do you got in there, cinder blocks?
Half a million in cash.
That's the spirit.
I got it, I got it.
Who's here for self-improvement?
Come on, give me a show of hands.
Who among you is here hoping they can actively improve who they are?
All right.
See, that's your first mistake.
You should be here to learn self-acceptance.
Hey, honey, you want another waffle?
I still got the iron out.
I could cut up some bananas.
Hi, you've reached Walt, Skyler, Flynn and Holly.
Please leave us a message.
Hey.

Skyler, listen...
- No, no!
There are a lot of angles to this, okay?
It's complicated, all right?
So please, let's...
Please, let's just sit back down and talk it through.
I'm gonna make you a deal, Walt.
I won't tell Hank and I won't tell your children or anybody else.
Nobody will hear it from me.
But only if you grant me this divorce and stay out of our lives.
- No, Skyler...
- I mean it.
Now let me the hell out of here before I throw up.
Bye, Jesse.
Your windshield's broken.
Yeah.
Little friction in the marriage right now.
Strictly temporary.
We're just...
We're just taking a little break.
That's you, over there.
Listen, money.
Saul has got it for you, so as soon as you're feeling better...
I'm better.
You're better?
Really?
- What, the rehab?
It helped?
- Yeah.
I'm done using.
That's excellent.
That's...
That's very good, Jesse.
Boy, very good.
You know, in spite of how bad things got it really could be looked at like a wake-up call for both of us.
I mean, you know, just to get our lives back together again and on the straight and narrow.
You been following this airplane crash?
Yeah.
You know it was Jane's dad who accidentally crashed them together because he was so torn up?
Okay, look, let me stop you right there, all right?
You are not responsible for this.
Not in any way, shape or form, all right?
Now, I am very up-to-date on this thing, probably far more than you are and there are many factors at play there.
Yeah?
For instance, there's some sort of collision radar on the jet that may not have been working.
That's public record.
You can look that up.
And the whole system is run on 1960s technology.
No.
No, really, I blame the government.
You either run from things or you face them, Mr. White.
- What exactly does that mean?
- I learned it in rehab.
It's all about accepting who you really are.
I accept who I am.
And who are you?
I'm the bad guy.
Here's some napkins for you.
Enjoy.
- Is the food to your satisfaction?
- Very much.
It's good to see you again.
- May I?
- Please.
I have an offer that I think will be of interest to you.
I actually am not here to...
I'm here because I owe you the courtesy and respect to tell you this personally.
I'm done.
It has nothing to do with you personally.
I find you extraordinarily professional and I appreciate the way you do business.
I'm just making a change in my life, is what it is.
And I'm...
I'm at something of a crossroads and it's brought me to a realization.
I am not a criminal.
No offence to any people who are but this is not me.
I'd like you to hear my offer, notwithstanding.
It won't change my mind, I'm sorry.
Three million dollars for three months of your time.
Three months, then out.
Three million?
May I take this as a "yes"?
I have money.
I have more money than I know how to spend.
What I don't have is my family.
The answer is still no.
Enjoy your meal.
Thank you.
That's it!
Did you feel it?
Texas!
I've made this trip three times and every time there's three big bumps and that's how you know!
We are officially in Texas!
This time I got a job waiting for me.
I got a cousin who's got a body shop.
Yo, that's for me, homes!
They call me "Olive Oil" because I paint them slick.
I do pearlescent, colour-shift, you name it.
I painted cars for some of the biggest gangsters in Michoacán.
Wow, those are beautiful boots!
Not much good for working, but...
Hey, what's on the toes there?
Little silver...
What the hell's going on in there?
That's it!
Did you feel it?
Texas!
I've made this trip three times and every time there's three big bumps and that's how you know!

We interrupt our scheduled programming to bring you breaking news.
Good afternoon.
In the last several minutes,
KOB has received dozens of reports of what appears to be a crashed aircraft-- possibly two aircraft-- on Albuquerque's east side.
As of yet, details are scarce, but callers describe witnessing an explosion overhead, followed by falling debris.
Visible now toward crash investigators with the National Transportation Safety Board are expected on-site as early as this evening.
But officials warn that, with a debris field of this magnitude, the investigation and the clean-up may well stretch-- ...are now saying that the Boeing 737 was being re-routed or vectored through the airspace, which is standard procedure,
according to a spokesman for the FAA.
The eight-seat King Air 350 was a charter flight operating out of Saint George, Utah, bound for Amarillo, Texas.
It sounded like hail.
Like heavy hailstones.
It was just, um... bump-bump-bump all over the neighborhood.
...indicating that the final death toll now stands at 167.
..67 muertos-- ...167.
This mid-air collision has left many wondering how such an accident could take place in a system with so many safeguards.
Allegations continue that the collision which brought down Flight 5 was caused by improper air traffic control.
The bombshell confirmation out of Oklahoma City today, as the FAA confirmed, it was, indeed, a lone air traffic controller's fateful mistake que el nombre del hombre es Donald Margolis.
...is Donald Margolis, a 19-year veteran of the FAA's
Air Route Traffic Control Center in Albuquerque.
...Margolis recently returned to work after a five-week absence, which was due to, quote, a personal loss.
While it's now known that Margolis had recently lost a daughter to a drug overdose a month before.
His troubled daughter Jane Margolis, aged 26, apparently had a long history of substance abuse.
And friends of the family say the death of his only child hit Margolis particularly hard.
Coming as it did little more than a month before, many are questioning the timing of his return to work, and are wondering how much blame truly lies with those who let this grieving father--
No.
No, no.
I usually open with "So sorry you're here."
Where would you like to begin?
I really just need this quick and easy, you know?
As quick as something like this can be.
Okay.
Is that mutual?
Does your husband go along with that?
Does he know?
Well, I mean, he certainly knows we're separated, so--
Has he moved out?
We're in the process of moving him out.
Yeah.
Today, hopefully.
And in the meantime, my-- my son and my daughter and I are staying with my sister.
So you've moved out?
Well, yes, just temporarily, only so he could get his things.
That was supposed to happen last week, but then came the crash, and--
Oh, God.
You weren't one of the-
- Right--
Yeah.
Right beneath the flight path.
And, um... uh, we had debris land in our yard and all of our neighborhood, so-
- Mmm.
Terrible.
Yeah.
Apparently, even, um... you know, parts of bodies, and so I certainly couldn't bring myself to--
So awful.
I know.
Anyway, I was certainly not ready to move back, but it's time.
And, um,...
I'm sure we're driving my sister and her husband up a wall.
Well, you definitely want to maintain residency in your actual home.
It just puts you in a better position in regards to custody.
Two children, you said?
Yes.
Holly here, and then I have a son in high school--
Walter Junior.
They need to stay with me.
Okay.
How long have you been married?
Sixteen years.
And it's not an apartment.
It's a house that you live in?
Mm-hmm.
Do you own outright?
Do you have a mortgage?
Yes.
There's definitely a mortgage.
We have, um... maybe 15 years on it.
What about other debts or assets?
Do you feel you have a good understanding of you and your husband's financial situation?
Is your husband employed?
You know what?
Here's the thing.
I-
- I'm really not looking for any, sort of, uh, loopholes or-- um--
I don't know-- just-
- No.
No loopholes.
I just intend that every one of my clients get a full and honest accounting of what it is they owe and what it is they own.
To that end, I say let's leave no stone unturned.
You'd be amazed what I've seen partners hide from one another.
Hey, Walt?
Hey.
Hey, buddy, there you are.
Listen, I, uh-
- You know, well--
It's, uh...time.
The s---tiest week since 9/11, okay?
Bar none.
Yeah, this is it.
Hands down, we're living it.
I mean, I speak with some authority because we definitely had some s---ty weeks in the past few months, you know?
But this here, I mean, call, you know-- call freakin' the Guinness Book of World Records--
Call freakin'- Am I talking too much?
Am I?
I am, right?
I am.
I know.
Look, look.
But this situation between you and, uh-- uh--
I'm not asking, by the way.
Okay?
It's none of my business.
I do not want to get in the middle of you two.
I'm just saying-
- Listen, listen-
- Okay?
You beat a little tactical retreat.
Yeah?
And regroup.
And then-- bong.
You know, absence makes the--
I'm pulling for you, you know?
I'm pulling--
Whoa, whoa.
No heavy lifting.
I got it.
No, it's okay.
I got it.
J----.
What do you got in there, cinder blocks?
Half a million in cash.
That's the spirit.
I got it.
I got it.
Whoo.
Who's here for self-improvement?
Come on, give me a show of hands.
Who among you is here hoping they can actively improve who they are?
Right.
See, that's your first mistake.
You should be here to learn self-acceptance.
Hey, honey, you, uh-- you want another waffle?
I still got the iron out.
I could cut up some bananas.
Hi, you're reached Walt, Skyler, Flynn, and Holly.
Please leave us a message.
Uh, hey.
Hello, everybody.
Good morning.
I was just checking in and thought I'd pass along the current contact information.
I mean, certainly, you can always reach me on my cell.
I've always got that on me.
But in terms of a mailing address,
I'm here at The Beachcomber.
And you know what?
It's actually very nice.
It's very pleasant.
Not as high end as the Oakwood, but, you know, not as corporate--
Oh, hey, would you please just-
Hey, Dad.
It's me.
No, I'm not okay.
I don't know what the h- - is going on.
Nobody's telling me jack s- - around here.
Hey, Flynn.
What-
- Whatever.
I-
- I don't even care anymore.
Can-
- Can you just give me a ride to school?
I'll take you to school.
Yeah.
No.
I-
- I'm ready now.
Flynn, I'm taking you to school.
All right.
I'm here.
See you soon.
May I have your attention, please?
As all of you know, last week our city suffered a terrible tragedy, one that none of us will ever forget, which is why today we're going to take a little time out of our schedule to gather in the gym and talk.
I just find it, you know, really-- really hard to concentrate because of all the horrors, you know, we perceived.
It just really gets inside your brain, and--
In college they have this thing where, if your roommate kills himself-- like, if you come home and find him hanging in the closet or whatever-- it's basically, like, an automatic "A" for you.
And I just think that that kind of compassion is-- is something to-
- Okay.
Thank you, Barry.
Who wants to go next?
Hmm?
No judgments, guys.
Just feelings.
You can say anything and everything that's on your mind.
Anyone?
There you go, honey.
I just keep asking myself--
Honey, could you please stand up?
Just keep asking myself, "Why did this happen?"
I mean, if there's a God and all, why does he allow all those innocent people to die for no reason?
Okay, can we just keep it secular, honey?
Anyhow, I haven't really been sleeping much.
Does anyone else have that?
I just keep hearing that- that sound.
That boom.
It just plays over and over in my head like it won't ever stop.
Thank you, sweetheart.
Is there anyone else?
Uh-- --
My neighbor, he heard the crash, and he ran out to his front yard, and he found, like, this seat-- you know, like, an airline seat.
Like one you have on an airliner?
Well, anyway, the seat was standing perfectly upright in his front yard, right next to his Sea-Doos-- because, like, he has Sea-Doos--
But... there was still a pair of legs buckled into them.
Human legs.
J---
- H. C-----.
You okay?
Yeah.
Sorry.
I-- um--
I was just moved.
Maybe we should hear from the faculty.
Certainly this tragedy didn't only affect our students.
Mr. White, would you like to say something?
And by the way, welcome back.
Hmm?
It's so good to have you back.
Uh...
I guess what I-
- I would--
Sorry.
Sorry.
I guess what I would want to say is... to look on the bright side.
First of all, nobody on the ground was killed.
And that-
- I mean, an incident like this over a populated urban center--
That right there, that's-- that's just gotta be some minor miracle, so--
Plus, neither plane was full.
You know, the-- the 737 was-- was what?
Uh, maybe two-thirds full, I believe.
Right?
Yes?
Or maybe even three-quarters full.
Well, at any rate, what you're left with casualty-wise is just the 50th worst air disaster.
Actually, tied for 50th.
There are, in truth, 53 crashes throughout history that are just as bad or worse--
Tenerife?
Has anybody-- anybody hear of Tenerife?
No?
In 1977, two fully loaded 747s crashed into each other on Tenerife.
Does anybody know how big a 747 is?
I mean, it's way bigger than a 737.
And we're talking about two of them.
Nearly 600 people died on Tenerife.
Doesn't any of you even remember it at all?
Any of you?
I doubt it.
You know why?
It's because... people move on.
They just move on.
And we will, too.
We will move on, and we will get past this because that is what human beings do.
We survive.
And, uh...
We survive, and-- and we-- we overcome.
Yeah.
We survive.
We survive, and--
Thank you.
Okay.
Thank you.
Good.
Well...
Hey, how's your Aunt Marie doing?
Fine, I guess.
Oh.
You make sure you say hello to her for me, will you?
Why don't you just come inside?
It's your house.
No, I--
He's gone.
Hey, Flynn!
Tricks.
It's an expression.
How are you?
Why do you gotta treat him like this?
Why you gotta be like this?
Why can't you just talk, even?
Hey, hey, hey.
Cool down.
Okay.
Okay.
Out of the mouths of babes, huh?
Wow.
You know, try not to hold it against him.
You know, I mean, the poor kid, he's probably just dying of curiosity.
You know, and I guess it would be natural for him to wonder.
I mean, he's probably just wondering, you know, what is it that could have gone so wrong-
- Marie.
...that my mother would leave-
- Marie.
I can't help you get through this, Skyler, you know, if you won't tell me what it is that Walt did.
Well, you know what?
I don't-
- I don't remember asking you, all right?
Well, I think that's- So if you want to be supportive, ...the reason you're stuck.
you could be supportive without prying, that would be really great- Prying, okay.
...and so-
- Well, prying's a strong word, but I don't-- ...helpful.
It's that... voice inside your head.
It's that sneaky, rat-bastard, 24/7 voice.
You guys know what I'm talking about.
That voice that tells you you're not good enough.
Not good enough for what?
Not good enough to... be what, President of the United States?
Well, okay, so maybe you're not that good.
But now are you good enough to deserve your share of basic human happiness?
Are you good enough to be okay with who and what you are?
I say yes.
But it doesn't matter what I say.
It's your voice, which means you're the only one that hears it, which means that you're the only one that can fight it.
Right?
Jesse... we never hear from you.
What's going on?
You can tell me I'm full of s---.
It's okay.
I don't mind.
Just-
- Come on.
Let us in on it.
So, like, what makes you the expert?
I don't think I ever said I was that.
Yeah, but you're the one sitting here, right?
Telling us thus and so, be happy, forgive yourself, blah, blah, blah.
Have you ever really hurt anybody?
I don't just mean disappointed your mother or whatever, but did you... ever really... hurt someone?
I killed my daughter.
It was July 18... which is my birthday.
July 18, 1992.
I was high on cocaine, and I was drunk.
Cocaine wasn't an issue because I had bought myself 2 grams the night before as a birthday present.
I had plenty left.
But I was out of vodka.
And this is in Portsmouth, Virginia, where instead of selling liquor in the supermarkets, they have these ABC stores which close at 5 p.m.
And right then it was, like, 4:42.
So I'm arguing with my wife--
"Come on, go to the ABC for me.
"It's my birthday.
"Come on.
They're not gonna sell it to me."
She's saying, "No, no."
So I'm p---ed, and the clock is ticking, so I jump in my truck.
She's-- my 6-year-old daughter...
She's playing at the end of the driveway.
So...
How do you not hate yourself?
I did hate myself... for a long time.
But it didn't stop me from... drinking and getting high.
It just made it that much worse.
Self-hatred, guilt, it accomplishes nothing.
It just stands in the way.
Stands in the way of what?
True change.
Skyler, hi.
Is this a good time to talk?
Yeah.
Come in, please.
Skyler.
Um...
Do you want to start?
Okay.
Why-
- Why are you doing this?
Why are you even thinking this way?
Is it to punish me?
I am not punishing you, Walt.
This is punitive is what this is.
We are happily married.
I am happily married.
I am happy.
We're just--
I love you, Skyler, and I would do anything for you.
Would you even consider--
I mean, J----!
You come in here, and you wave these papers in my face, when there's a whole other entire side to this thing.
There's your side, and there's my side.
And you haven't heard my side yet.
You haven't heard any of it at all.
You're a drug dealer.
No.
What-
- How--
What?
Yeah.
How else could you possibly make that kind of money?
Marijuana.
That Pinkman kid.
No?
Oh, my God, Walt.
Cocaine?
It's methamphetamine.
But I-
- I'm--
I manufacture.
I am not a dealer.
Oh.
Per se.
It doesn't--
No, Skyler.
Listen to me, Skyler.
No.
Listen.
No.
There are a lot of angles to this, okay?
It's complicated, all right?
So please, let's--
Please, let's just sit back down, and we'll talk it through.
I'm gonna make you a deal, Walt.
I won't tell Hank, and I won't tell your children or anybody else.
Nobody will hear it from me, but only if you grant me this divorce and stay out of our lives.
No, Skyler.
I mean it.
Now let me the h- out of here before I throw up.
Your windshield's broken.
Yep.
A little friction in the marriage right now.
Strictly temporary.
We're just-- just taking a little break.
Uh, that's you over there.
Listen, um, money.
Saul has got it for you, and so as so as you're feeling better--
I'm better.
You're better.
Really?
What?
The rehab?
It helped?
Yeah.
I'm done using.
That's excellent.
That's--
That's very good, Jesse.
Boy-
- Very good.
You know, um... in spite of how bad things got, it really could be looked at like a wake-up call for th of us.
I mean, you know, just to get our-- our lives back together again and on the straight and narrow.
You been following this airplane crash?
Yeah.
You know it was Jane's dad who accidentally crashed them together?
Because he was so torn up?
Okay, look, let me stop you right there, all right?
You are not responsible for this-- not in any way, shape, or form, all right?
Now, I-
- I am very up-to-date on this thing, probably far more than you are, and there are-- there are many factors at play there.
Yeah?
For instance, there's some sort of collision radar on the jet that may not have been working properly.
Now, that's public record.
You can look that up.
And the whole system is run on-- on 1960s technology.
No.
No, really...
I blame the government.
You either run from things, or you face them, Mr. White.
And what exactly does that mean?
I learned it in rehab.
It's all about accepting who you really are.
I accept who I am.
And who are you?
I'm the bad guy.
Is the food to your satisfaction?
Very much.
It's good to see you again.
May I?
I have an offer that I think will be of interest to you.
I actually am not here to--
I'm here because I owe you the courtesy and respect to tell you this personally.
I'm done.
It has nothing to do with you personally.
I find you extraordinarily professional, and I appreciate the way you do business.
I'm just... making a change in my life is what it is, and I'm--
I'm at some- something of a crossroads.
It has brought me to a realization.
I am not a criminal.
No offense to any people who are.
But... this is not me.
I'd like you to hear my offer, notwithstanding.
It won't change my mind.
I'm sorry.
$3 million for three months of your time.
Three months, then out.
3 million?
May I take this as a yes?
I have money.
I have more money than know how to spend.
What I don't have is my family.
The answer is still no.
Enjoy your meal.
Thank you.
What the h--- is going on in there?

What do you got in there, cinder blocks?
Half a million in cash.
That's the spirit.
I got it.
I got it.
Whoo.
Who's here for self-improvement?
Come on, give me a show of hands.
Who among you is here hoping they can actively improve who they are?
Right.
See, that's your first mistake.
You should be here to learn self-acceptance.
Hey, honey, you, uh- you want another waffle?
I still got the iron out.
I could cut up some bananas.
Hi, you're reached Walt, Skyler, Flynn, and Holly.
Please leave us a message.
Uh, hey.
Hello, everybody.
Good morning.
I was just checking in and thought I'd pass along the current contact information.
I mean, certainly, you can always reach me on my cell.
I've always got that on me.
But in terms of a mailing address,
I'm here at The Beachcomber.
And you know what?
It's actually very nice.
It's very pleasant.
Not as high end as the Oakwood, but, you know, not as corporate-
Oh, hey, would you please just-
Hey, Dad.
It's me.
No, I'm not okay.
I don't know what the h- - is going on.
Nobody's telling me jack s- - around here.
Hey, Flynn.
What
- Whatever.
I
- I don't even care anymore.
Can
- Can you just give me a ride to school?
I'll take you to school.
Yeah.
No.
I
- I'm ready now.
Flynn, I'm taking you to school.
All right.
I'm here.
See you soon.
May I have your attention, please?
As all of you know, last week our city suffered a terrible tragedy, one that none of us will ever forget, which is why today we're going to take a little time out of our schedule to gather in the gym and talk.
I just find it, you know, really- really hard to concentrate because of all the horrors, you know, we perceived.
It just really gets inside your brain, and-
In college they have this thing where, if your roommate kills himself- like, if you come home and find him hanging in the closet or whatever- it's basically, like, an automatic "A" for you.
And I just think that that kind of compassion is- is something to
- Okay.
Thank you, Barry.
Who wants to go next?
Hmm?
No judgments, guys.
Just feelings.
You can say anything and everything that's on your mind.
Anyone?
There you go, honey.
I just keep asking myself-
Honey, could you please stand up?
Just keep asking myself, "Why did this happen?"
I mean, if there's a God and all, why does he allow all those innocent people to die for no reason?
Okay, can we just keep it secular, honey?
Anyhow, I haven't really been sleeping much.
Does anyone else have that?
I just keep hearing that- that sound.
That boom.
It just plays over and over in my head like it won't ever stop.
Thank you, sweetheart.
Is there anyone else?
Uh- -
My neighbor, he heard the crash, and he ran out to his front yard, and he found, like, this seat- you know, like, an airline seat.
Like one you have on an airliner?
Well, anyway, the seat was standing perfectly upright in his front yard, right next to his Sea-Doos- because, like, he has Sea-Doos-
But... there was still a pair of legs buckled into them.
Human legs.
J
- H. C-.
You okay?
Yeah.
Sorry.
I- um-
I was just moved.
Maybe we should hear from the faculty.
Certainly this tragedy didn't only affect our students.
Mr. White, would you like to say something?
And by the way, welcome back.
Hmm?
It's so good to have you back.
Uh...
I guess what I
- I would-
Sorry.
Sorry.
I guess what I would want to say is... to look on the bright side.
First of all, nobody on the ground was killed.
And that
- I mean, an incident like this over a populated urban center-
That right there, that's- that's just gotta be some minor miracle, so-
Plus, neither plane was full.
You know, the- the 737 was- was what?
Uh, maybe two-thirds full, I believe.
Right?
Yes?
Or maybe even three-quarters full.
Well, at any rate, what you're left with casualty-wise is just the 50th worst air disaster.
Actually, tied for 50th.
There are, in truth, 53 crashes throughout history that are just as bad or worse-
Tenerife?
Has anybody- anybody hear of Tenerife?
No?
In 1977, two fully loaded 747s crashed into each other on Tenerife.
Does anybody know how big a 747 is?
I mean, it's way bigger than a 737.
And we're talking about two of them.
Nearly 600 people died on Tenerife.
Doesn't any of you even remember it at all?
Any of you?
I doubt it.
You know why?
It's because... people move on.
They just move on.
And we will, too.
We will move on, and we will get past this because that is what human beings do.
We survive.
And, uh...
We survive, and- and we- we overcome.
Yeah.
We survive.
We survive, and-
Thank you.
Okay.
Thank you.
Good.
Well...
Hey, how's your Aunt Marie doing?
Fine, I guess.
Oh.
You make sure you say hello to her for me, will you?
Why don't you just come inside?
It's your house.
No, I-
He's gone.
Hey, Flynn!
Tricks.
It's an expression.
How are you?
Why do you gotta treat him like this?
Why you gotta be like this?
Why can't you just talk, even?
Hey, hey, hey.
Cool down.
Okay.
Okay.
Out of the mouths of babes, huh?
Wow.
You know, try not to hold it against him.
You know, I mean, the poor kid, he's probably just dying of curiosity.
You know, and I guess it would be natural for him to wonder.
I mean, he's probably just wondering, you know, what is it that could have gone so wrong
- Marie.
...that my mother would leave
- Marie.
I can't help you get through this, Skyler, you know, if you won't tell me what it is that Walt did.
Well, you know what?
I don't
- I don't remember asking you, all right?
Well, I think that's- So if you want to be supportive, ...the reason you're stuck.
you could be supportive without prying, that would be really great- Prying, okay.
...and so
- Well, prying's a strong word, but I don't- ...helpful.
It's that... voice inside your head.
It's that sneaky, rat-bastard, 24/7 voice.
You guys know what I'm talking about.
That voice that tells you you're not good enough.
Not good enough for what?
Not good enough to... be what, President of the United States?
Well, okay, so maybe you're not that good.
But now are you good enough to deserve your share of basic human happiness?
Are you good enough to be okay with who and what you are?
I say yes.
But it doesn't matter what I say.
It's your voice, which means you're the only one that hears it, which means that you're the only one that can fight it.
Right?
Jesse... we never hear from you.
What's going on?
You can tell me I'm full of s-.
It's okay.
I don't mind.
Just
- Come on.
Let us in on it.
So, like, what makes you the expert?
I don't think I ever said I was that.
Yeah, but you're the one sitting here, right?
Telling us thus and so, be happy, forgive yourself, blah, blah, blah.
Have you ever really hurt anybody?
I don't just mean disappointed your mother or whatever, but did you... ever really... hurt someone?
I killed my daughter.
It was July 18... which is my birthday.
July 18, 1992.
I was high on cocaine, and I was drunk.
Cocaine wasn't an issue because I had bought myself 2 grams the night before as a birthday present.
I had plenty left.
But I was out of vodka.
And this is in Portsmouth, Virginia, where instead of selling liquor in the supermarkets, they have these ABC stores which close at 5 p. m.
And right then it was, like, 4:42.
So I'm arguing with my wife-
"Come on, go to the ABC for me.
"It's my birthday.
"Come on.
They're not gonna sell it to me. "
She's saying, "No, no. "
So I'm p-ed, and the clock is ticking, so I jump in my truck.
She's- my 6-year-old daughter...
She's playing at the end of the driveway.
So...
How do you not hate yourself?
I did hate myself... for a long time.
But it didn't stop me from... drinking and getting high.
It just made it that much worse.
Self-hatred, guilt, it accomplishes nothing.
It just stands in the way.
Stands in the way of what?
True change.
Skyler, hi.
Is this a good time to talk?
Yeah.
Come in, please.
Skyler.
Um...
Do you want to start?
Okay.
Why
- Why are you doing this?
Why are you even thinking this way?
Is it to punish me?
I am not punishing you, Walt.
This is punitive is what this is.
We are happily married.
I am happily married.
I am happy.
We're just-
I love you, Skyler, and I would do anything for you.
Would you even consider-
I mean, J-!
You come in here, and you wave these papers in my face, when there's a whole other entire side to this thing.
There's your side, and there's my side.
And you haven't heard my side yet.
You haven't heard any of it at all.
You're a drug dealer.
No.
What
- How-
What?
Yeah.
How else could you possibly make that kind of money?
Marijuana.
That Pinkman kid.
No?
Oh, my God, Walt.
Cocaine?
It's methamphetamine.
But I
- I'm-
I manufacture.
I am not a dealer.
Oh.
Per se.
It doesn't-
No, Skyler.
Listen to me, Skyler.
No.
Listen.
No.
There are a lot of angles to this, okay?
It's complicated, all right?
So please, let's-
Please, let's just sit back down, and we'll talk it through.
I'm gonna make you a deal, Walt.
I won't tell Hank, and I won't tell your children or anybody else.
Nobody will hear it from me, but only if you grant me this divorce and stay out of our lives.
No, Skyler.
I mean it.
Now let me the h- out of here before I throw up.
Your windshield's broken.
Yep.
A little friction in the marriage right now.
Strictly temporary.
We're just- just taking a little break.
Uh, that's you over there.
Listen, um, money.
Saul has got it for you, and so as so as you're feeling better-
I'm better.
You're better.
Really?
What?
The rehab?
It helped?
Yeah.
I'm done using.
That's excellent.
That's-
That's very good, Jesse.
Boy
- Very good.
You know, um... in spite of how bad things got, it really could be looked at like a wake-up call for th of us.
I mean, you know, just to get our- our lives back together again and on the straight and narrow.
You been following this airplane crash?
Yeah.
You know it was Jane's dad who accidentally crashed them together?
Because he was so torn up?
Okay, look, let me stop you right there, all right?
You are not responsible for this- not in any way, shape, or form, all right?
Now, I
- I am very up-to-date on this thing, probably far more than you are, and there are- there are many factors at play there.
Yeah?
For instance, there's some sort of collision radar on the jet that may not have been working properly.
Now, that's public record.
You can look that up.
And the whole system is run on- on 1960s technology.
No.
No, really...
I blame the government.
You either run from things, or you face them, Mr. White.
And what exactly does that mean?
I learned it in rehab.
It's all about accepting who you really are.
I accept who I am.
And who are you?
I'm the bad guy.
Is the food to your satisfaction?
Very much.
It's good to see you again.
May I?
I have an offer that I think will be of interest to you.
I actually am not here to-
I'm here because I owe you the courtesy and respect to tell you this personally.
I'm done.
It has nothing to do with you personally.
I find you extraordinarily professional, and I appreciate the way you do business.
I'm just... making a change in my life is what it is, and I'm-
I'm at some- something of a crossroads.
It has brought me to a realization.
I am not a criminal.
No offense to any people who are.
But... this is not me.
I'd like you to hear my offer, notwithstanding.
It won't change my mind.
I'm sorry.
$3 million for three months of your time.
Three months, then out.
3 million?
May I take this as a yes?
I have money.
I have more money than know how to spend.
What I don't have is my family.
The answer is still no.
Enjoy your meal.
Thank you.
What the h- is going on in there?
We interrupt scheduled programming to bring you this breaking news.
Good afternoon.
In the last several minutes KOB has received dozens of reports of what appears to be a crashed aircraft, possibly two aircraft on Albuquerque's east side.
As of yet details are scarce but callers describe witnessing an explosion overhead followed by falling debris.
Visible now...
- crash investigators with the National Transportation Safety Board are expected on site as early as this evening.
But officials warn that with a debris field of this magnitude, the investigation...
Officials are now saying that the Boeing 737 was being re-routed, or vectored, through the airspace which is standard procedure according to a spokesman for the FAA.
The eight-seat King Air 350 was a charter flight operating out of St. George, Utah, bound for Amarillo, Texas.
It sounded like hail, like heavy hailstones.
It was just bump-bump-bump, all over the neighborhood...
- indicating that the final death toll now stands at 167.
- One hundred and sixty-seven.
This mid-air collision has left many wondering how such an accident could take place in a system with so many safeguards.
- That the collision which brought down Flight 515 was caused by improper air traffic control.
We have the bombshell confirmation out of Oklahoma City as the FAA confirmed it was indeed a lone air traffic controller's fateful mistake which brought about the crash.
- Is Donald Margolis, a 19-year veteran of the FAA's Air Route Traffic Control Center in Albuquerque...
- Margolis recently returned to work after a five-week absence which was due to, quote, "a personal loss".
While it's now known that Margolis had recently lost a daughter to a...
- drug overdose a month before.
His troubled daughter Jane Margolis, aged 26 apparently had a long history of substance abuse.
Friends of the family say the death of his only child hit Margolis particularly hard.
Coming as it did little more than a month before many are questioning the timing of his return to work and are wondering how much blame truly lies with those who let this grieving father...
I usually open with "So sorry you're here."
Where would you like to begin?
I really just need this quick and easy, you know?
As quick as something like this can be.
So...
Okay.
Is that mutual?
Does your husband go along with that?
Does he know?
Well, I mean, he certainly knows we're separated, so...
Has he moved out?
We're in the process of moving him out.
Yeah.
Today, hopefully.
And in the meantime, my son and my daughter and I are staying with my sister.
- So you've moved out?
- Well, yes, just temporarily.
Only so he could get his things and...
That was supposed to happen last week, but then came the crash and...
Oh, God, you weren't one of the...?
Right, yeah.
Right beneath the flight path.
And we had debris land in our yard, and all over our neighborhood, so...
- Terrible.
- Yeah.
Apparently, even you know, parts of bodies.
So I certainly couldn't bring myself to...
- So awful.
- I know.
Anyway, I was certainly not ready to move back.
But it's time.
And I'm sure we're driving my sister and her husband up a wall.
Well, you definitely wanna maintain residency in your actual home.
It just puts you in a better position in regards to custody.
Two children, you said?
Yes.
Holly here, and then I have a son in high school, Walter Jr.
- They need to stay with me.
- Okay.
- How long have you been married?
- Sixteen years.
And it's not an apartment, it's a house that you live in?
Do you own outright, do you have a mortgage?
Yes, there's definitely a mortgage.
We have maybe 15 years on it.
What about other debts or assets?
Do you feel you have a good understanding of you and your husband's financial situation?
- Is your husband employed?
- Here's the thing.
I'm really not looking for any sort of loopholes or I don't know, just...
- No, no loopholes.
I just intend that every one of my clients get a full and honest accounting of what it is they owe and what it is they own.
To that end, I say let's leave no stone unturned.
You'd be amazed what I've seen partners hide from one another.
Walt?
Hey, buddy?
Hey, Walt?
- Hey.
- There you are.
Listen, I...
You know, well...
It's...
It's time.
The shittiest week since 9/11, okay?
Bar none.
This is it.
Hands down, we're living it.
I speak with authority because we had some shitty weeks the past few months.
But this here?
I mean call freaking Guinness Book of World Records, call freaking...
Am I talking too much?
I am, right?
I am, I know.
But this situation between you and...
You know, I don't know.
I'm not asking, by the way.
It's none of my business.
I do not wanna get in the middle of you two.
I'm just saying, listen, okay?
You beat a little tactical retreat you regroup, and then:
You know, absence makes the...
Yeah.
I'm pulling for you, man.
I'm pulling for you.
- No heavy lifting.
I got it.
- No, it's okay.
I got it.
Jesus.
What do you got in there, cinder blocks?
Half a million in cash.
That's the spirit.
I got it, I got it.
Who's here for self-improvement?
Come on, give me a show of hands.
Who among you is here hoping they can actively improve who they are?
All right.
See, that's your first mistake.

Why don't you just come inside?

No, I...
He's gone.
Hey, Flynn.
How's tricks?

It's an expression.

I can't help you get through this you know, if you won't tell me what it is that Walt did?
Well, you know what, I don't remember asking you, all right?
So if you wanna be supportive, you could be supportive without prying.
- That would be really great...
- "Prying."
...and so helpful.
- Well, prying's a strong word.
It's that voice inside your head.
It's that sneaky, rat-bastard, 24/7 voice.
You know what I'm talking about.
That voice that tells you you're not good enough.
Not good enough for what?
Not good enough to be what president of the United States?
Well, okay, so maybe you're not that good.
But now are you good enough to deserve your share of basic human happiness?
Are you good enough to be okay with who and what you are?
I say yes.
But it doesn't matter what I say.
It's your voice, which means you're the one that hears it.
Which means you're the only one that can fight it, right?
Jesse, we never hear from you.
What's going on?
You can tell me I'm full of shit.
It's okay, I don't mind.
Just come on.
Let us in on it.
So, like, what makes you the expert?
I don't think I ever said I was that.
Yeah, but you're the one sitting here, right?
Telling us "thus" and "so," "be happy," "forgive yourself," blah, blah, blah.
Have you ever really hurt anybody?
I don't just mean disappointed your mother or whatever but did you ever really hurt someone?
I killed my daughter.
It was July 18th, which is my birthday.
July 18th, 1992.
I was high on cocaine and I was drunk.
Cocaine wasn't an issue.
I had bought myself two grams as a birthday present.

"Come on.

Come on.
They're not gonna sell it to me."
And she's saying "No, no."
So I'm pissed.
And the clock is ticking, so I jump in my truck.
She's my 6-year-old daughter.
She's playing at the end of the driveway.
So...
How do you not hate yourself?
I did hate myself for a long time.
But it didn't stop me from drinking and getting high.
It just made it that much worse.
Self-hatred, guilt, it accomplishes nothing.
It just stands in the way.
Stands in the way of what?
True change.
Skyler.
Is this a good time to talk?
Yeah.
Come in.
Please.
Skyler.
Do you wanna start?
Okay.
Why are you doing this?
Why are you even thinking this way?
- Is it to punish me?
- I am not punishing you, Walt.
This is punitive, is what this is.
We are happily married.
I am happily married.
I am happy.
We're just...
I love you, Skyler.
And I would do anything for you.
Would you even consider?
I mean, Jesus!
You come in here and you wave these papers in my face when there's a whole other, entire side to this thing.
There's your side and there's my side, and you haven't heard my side yet.
You haven't heard any of it at all.
You're a drug dealer.
No.
What...?
How?
What?
Yeah.
How else could you possibly make that kind of money?
Marijuana.
That Pinkman kid.
No?
Oh, my God, Walt.
Cocaine?
It's methamphetamine.
But I'm a manufacturer, I'm not a dealer per se.
It doesn't mean...
No, Skyler!
- Listen to me.
Skyler, listen...
- No, no!
There are a lot of angles to this, okay?
It's complicated, all right?
So please, let's...
Please, let's just sit back down and talk it through.
I'm gonna make you a deal, Walt.
I won't tell Hank and I won't tell your children or anybody else.
Nobody will hear it from me.
But only if you grant me this divorce and stay out of our lives.
- No, Skyler...
- I mean it.
Now let me the hell out of here before I throw up.
Bye, Jesse.
Your windshield's broken.
Yeah.
Little friction in the marriage right now.
Strictly temporary.
We're just...
We're just taking a little break.
That's you, over there.
Listen, money.
Saul has got it for you, so as soon as you're feeling better...
I'm better.
You're better?
Really?
- What, the rehab?
It helped?
- Yeah.
I'm done using.
That's excellent.
That's...
That's very good, Jesse.
Boy, very good.
You know, in spite of how bad things got it really could be looked at like a wake-up call for both of us.
I mean, you know, just to get our lives back together again and on the straight and narrow.
You been following this airplane crash?
Yeah.
You know it was Jane's dad who accidentally crashed them together because he was so torn up?
Okay, look, let me stop you right there, all right?
You are not responsible for this.
Not in any way, shape or form, all right?
Now, I am very up-to-date on this thing, probably far more than you are and there are many factors at play there.
Yeah?
For instance, there's some sort of collision radar on the jet that may not have been working.
That's public record.
You can look that up.
And the whole system is run on 1960s technology.
No.
No, really, I blame the government.
You either run from things or you face them, Mr. White.
- What exactly does that mean?
- I learned it in rehab.
It's all about accepting who you really are.
I accept who I am.
And who are you?
I'm the bad guy.
Here's some napkins for you.
Enjoy.
- Is the food to your satisfaction?
- Very much.
It's good to see you again.
- May I?
- Please.
I have an offer that I think will be of interest to you.
I actually am not here to...
I'm here because I owe you the courtesy and respect to tell you this personally.
I'm done.
It has nothing to do with you personally.
I find you extraordinarily professional and I appreciate the way you do business.
I'm just making a change in my life, is what it is.
And I'm...
I'm at something of a crossroads and it's brought me to a realization.
I am not a criminal.
No offense to any people who are but this is not me.
I'd like you to hear my offer, notwithstanding.
It won't change my mind, I'm sorry.
Three million dollars for three months of your time.
Three months, then out.
Three million?
May I take this as a "yes"?
I have money.
I have more money than I know how to spend.
What I don't have is my family.
The answer is still no.
Enjoy your meal.
Thank you.
That's it!
Did you feel it?
Texas!
I've made this trip three times and every time there's three big bumps and that's how you know!
We are officially in Texas!
This time I got a job waiting for me.
I got a cousin who's got a body shop.
Yo, that's for me, homes!
They call me "Olive Oil" because I paint them slick.
I do pearlescent, color-shift, you name it.
I painted cars for some of the biggest gangsters in Michoacán.
Wow, those are beautiful boots!
Not much good for working, but...
Hey, what's on the toes there?
Little silver...
What the hell's going on in there?
We interrupt our scheduled programming to bring you breaking news.
Good afternoon.
In the last several minutes,
KOB has received dozens of reports of what appears to be a crashed aircraft-- possibly two aircraft-- on Albuquerque's east side.
As of yet, details are scarce, but callers describe witnessing an explosion overhead, followed by falling debris.
Visible now toward crash investigators with the National Transportation Safety Board are expected on-site as early as this evening.
But officials warn that, with a debris field of this magnitude, the investigation and the clean-up may well stretch-- ...are now saying that the Boeing 737 was being re-routed or vectored through the airspace, which is standard procedure,
according to a spokesman for the FAA.
The eight-seat King Air 350 was a charter flight operating out of Saint George, Utah, bound for Amarillo, Texas.
It sounded like hail.
Like heavy hailstones.
It was just, um... bump-bump-bump all over the neighborhood.
...indicating that the final death toll now stands at 167.
..67 muertos-- ...167.
This mid-air collision has left many wondering how such an accident could take place in a system with so many safeguards.
Allegations continue that the collision which brought down Flight 5 was caused by improper air traffic control.
The bombshell confirmation out of Oklahoma City today, as the FAA confirmed, it was, indeed, a lone air traffic controller's fateful mistake que el nombre del hombre es Donald Margolis.
...is Donald Margolis, a 19-year veteran of the FAA's
Air Route Traffic Control Center in Albuquerque.
...Margolis recently returned to work after a five-week absence, which was due to, quote, a personal loss.
While it's now known that Margolis had recently lost a daughter to a drug overdose a month before.
His troubled daughter Jane Margolis, aged 26, apparently had a long history of substance abuse.
And friends of the family say the death of his only child hit Margolis particularly hard.
Coming as it did little more than a month before, many are questioning the timing of his return to work, and are wondering how much blame truly lies with those who let this grieving father--
No.
No, no.
I usually open with "So sorry you're here."
Where would you like to begin?
I really just need this quick and easy, you know?
As quick as something like this can be.
Okay.
Is that mutual?
Does your husband go along with that?
Does he know?
Well, I mean, he certainly knows we're separated, so--
Has he moved out?
We're in the process of moving him out.
Yeah.
Today, hopefully.
And in the meantime, my-- my son and my daughter and I are staying with my sister.
So you've moved out?
Well, yes, just temporarily, only so he could get his things.
That was supposed to happen last week, but then came the crash, and--
Oh, God.
You weren't one of the-
- Right--
Yeah.
Right beneath the flight path.
And, um... uh, we had debris land in our yard and all of our neighborhood, so-
- Mmm.
Terrible.
Yeah.
Apparently, even, um... you know, parts of bodies, and so I certainly couldn't bring myself to--
So awful.
I know.
Anyway, I was certainly not ready to move back, but it's time.
And, um,...
I'm sure we're driving my sister and her husband up a wall.
Well, you definitely want to maintain residency in your actual home.
It just puts you in a better position in regards to custody.
Two children, you said?
Yes.
Holly here, and then I have a son in high school--
Walter Junior.
They need to stay with me.
Okay.
How long have you been married?
Sixteen years.
And it's not an apartment.
It's a house that you live in?
Mm-hmm.
Do you own outright?
Do you have a mortgage?
Yes.
There's definitely a mortgage.
We have, um... maybe 15 years on it.
What about other debts or assets?
Do you feel you have a good understanding of you and your husband's financial situation?
Is your husband employed?
You know what?
Here's the thing.
I-
- I'm really not looking for any, sort of, uh, loopholes or-- um--
I don't know-- just-
- No.
No loopholes.
I just intend that every one of my clients get a full and honest accounting of what it is they owe and what it is they own.
To that end, I say let's leave no stone unturned.
You'd be amazed what I've seen partners hide from one another.
Hey, Walt?
Hey.
Hey, buddy, there you are.
Listen, I, uh-
- You know, well--
It's, uh...time.
The s---tiest week since 9/11, okay?
Bar none.
Yeah, this is it.
Hands down, we're living it.
I mean, I speak with some authority because we definitely had some s---ty weeks in the past few months, you know?
But this here, I mean, call, you know-- call freakin' the Guinness Book of World Records--
Call freakin'- Am I talking too much?
Am I?
I am, right?
I am.
I know.
Look, look.
But this situation between you and, uh-- uh--
I'm not asking, by the way.
Okay?
It's none of my business.
I do not want to get in the middle of you two.
I'm just saying-
- Listen, listen-
- Okay?
You beat a little tactical retreat.
Yeah?
And regroup.
And then-- bong.
You know, absence makes the--
I'm pulling for you, you know?
I'm pulling--
Whoa, whoa.
No heavy lifting.
I got it.
No, it's okay.
I got it.
J----.
What do you got in there, cinder blocks?
Half a million in cash.
That's the spirit.
I got it.
I got it.
Whoo.
Who's here for self-improvement?
Come on, give me a show of hands.
Who among you is here hoping they can actively improve who they are?
Right.
See, that's your first mistake.
You should be here to learn self-acceptance.
Hey, honey, you, uh-- you want another waffle?
I still got the iron out.
I could cut up some bananas.
Hi, you're reached Walt, Skyler, Flynn, and Holly.
Please leave us a message.
Uh, hey.
Hello, everybody.
Good morning.
I was just checking in and thought I'd pass along the current contact information.
I mean, certainly, you can always reach me on my cell.
I've always got that on me.
But in terms of a mailing address,
I'm here at The Beachcomber.
And you know what?
It's actually very nice.
It's very pleasant.
Not as high end as the Oakwood, but, you know, not as corporate--
Oh, hey, would you please just-
Hey, Dad.
It's me.
No, I'm not okay.
I don't know what the h- - is going on.
Nobody's telling me jack s- - around here.
Hey, Flynn.
What-
- Whatever.
I-
- I don't even care anymore.
Can-
- Can you just give me a ride to school?
I'll take you to school.
Yeah.
No.
I-
- I'm ready now.
Flynn, I'm taking you to school.
All right.
I'm here.
See you soon.
May I have your attention, please?
As all of you know, last week our city suffered a terrible tragedy, one that none of us will ever forget, which is why today we're going to take a little time out of our schedule to gather in the gym and talk.
I just find it, you know, really-- really hard to concentrate because of all the horrors, you know, we perceived.
It just really gets inside your brain, and--
In college they have this thing where, if your roommate kills himself-- like, if you come home and find him hanging in the closet or whatever-- it's basically, like, an automatic "A" for you.
And I just think that that kind of compassion is-- is something to-
- Okay.
Thank you, Barry.
Who wants to go next?
Hmm?
No judgments, guys.
Just feelings.
You can say anything and everything that's on your mind.
Anyone?
There you go, honey.
I just keep asking myself--
Honey, could you please stand up?
Just keep asking myself, "Why did this happen?"
I mean, if there's a God and all, why does he allow all those innocent people to die for no reason?
Okay, can we just keep it secular, honey?
Anyhow, I haven't really been sleeping much.
Does anyone else have that?
I just keep hearing that- that sound.
That boom.
It just plays over and over in my head like it won't ever stop.
Thank you, sweetheart.
Is there anyone else?
Uh-- --
My neighbor, he heard the crash, and he ran out to his front yard, and he found, like, this seat-- you know, like, an airline seat.
Like one you have on an airliner?
Well, anyway, the seat was standing perfectly upright in his front yard, right next to his Sea-Doos-- because, like, he has Sea-Doos--
But... there was still a pair of legs buckled into them.
Human legs.
J---
- H. C-----.
You okay?
Yeah.
Sorry.
I-- um--
I was just moved.
Maybe we should hear from the faculty.
Certainly this tragedy didn't only affect our students.
Mr. White, would you like to say something?
And by the way, welcome back.
Hmm?
It's so good to have you back.
Uh...
I guess what I-
- I would--
Sorry.
Sorry.
I guess what I would want to say is... to look on the bright side.
First of all, nobody on the ground was killed.
And that-
- I mean, an incident like this over a populated urban center--
That right there, that's-- that's just gotta be some minor miracle, so--
Plus, neither plane was full.
You know, the-- the 737 was-- was what?
Uh, maybe two-thirds full, I believe.
Right?
Yes?
Or maybe even three-quarters full.
Well, at any rate, what you're left with casualty-wise is just the 50th worst air disaster.
Actually, tied for 50th.
There are, in truth, 53 crashes throughout history that are just as bad or worse--
Tenerife?
Has anybody-- anybody hear of Tenerife?
No?
In 1977, two fully loaded 747s crashed into each other on Tenerife.
Does anybody know how big a 747 is?
I mean, it's way bigger than a 737.
And we're talking about two of them.
Nearly 600 people died on Tenerife.
Doesn't any of you even remember it at all?
Any of you?
I doubt it.
You know why?
It's because... people move on.
They just move on.
And we will, too.
We will move on, and we will get past this because that is what human beings do.
We survive.
And, uh...
We survive, and-- and we-- we overcome.
Yeah.
We survive.
We survive, and--
Thank you.
Okay.
Thank you.
Good.
Well...
Hey, how's your Aunt Marie doing?
Fine, I guess.
Oh.
You make sure you say hello to her for me, will you?
Why don't you just come inside?
It's your house.
No, I--
He's gone.
Hey, Flynn!
Tricks.
It's an expression.
How are you?
Why do you gotta treat him like this?
Why you gotta be like this?
Why can't you just talk, even?
Hey, hey, hey.
Cool down.
Okay.
Okay.
Out of the mouths of babes, huh?
Wow.
You know, try not to hold it against him.
You know, I mean, the poor kid, he's probably just dying of curiosity.
You know, and I guess it would be natural for him to wonder.
I mean, he's probably just wondering, you know, what is it that could have gone so wrong-
- Marie.
...that my mother would leave-
- Marie.
I can't help you get through this, Skyler, you know, if you won't tell me what it is that Walt did.
Well, you know what?
I don't-
- I don't remember asking you, all right?
Well, I think that's- So if you want to be supportive, ...the reason you're stuck.
you could be supportive without prying, that would be really great- Prying, okay.
...and so-
- Well, prying's a strong word, but I don't-- ...helpful.
It's that... voice inside your head.
It's that sneaky, rat-bastard, 24/7 voice.
You guys know what I'm talking about.
That voice that tells you you're not good enough.
Not good enough for what?
Not good enough to... be what, President of the United States?
Well, okay, so maybe you're not that good.
But now are you good enough to deserve your share of basic human happiness?
Are you good enough to be okay with who and what you are?
I say yes.
But it doesn't matter what I say.
It's your voice, which means you're the only one that hears it, which means that you're the only one that can fight it.
Right?
Jesse... we never hear from you.
What's going on?
You can tell me I'm full of s---.
It's okay.
I don't mind.
Just-
- Come on.
Let us in on it.
So, like, what makes you the expert?
I don't think I ever said I was that.
Yeah, but you're the one sitting here, right?
Telling us thus and so, be happy, forgive yourself, blah, blah, blah.
Have you ever really hurt anybody?
I don't just mean disappointed your mother or whatever, but did you... ever really... hurt someone?
I killed my daughter.
It was July 18... which is my birthday.
July 18, 1992.
I was high on cocaine, and I was drunk.
Cocaine wasn't an issue because I had bought myself 2 grams the night before as a birthday present.
I had plenty left.
But I was out of vodka.
And this is in Portsmouth, Virginia, where instead of selling liquor in the supermarkets, they have these ABC stores which close at 5 p.m.
And right then it was, like, 4:42.
So I'm arguing with my wife--
"Come on, go to the ABC for me.
"It's my birthday.
"Come on.
They're not gonna sell it to me."
She's saying, "No, no."
So I'm p---ed, and the clock is ticking, so I jump in my truck.
She's-- my 6-year-old daughter...
She's playing at the end of the driveway.
So...
How do you not hate yourself?
I did hate myself... for a long time.
But it didn't stop me from... drinking and getting high.
It just made it that much worse.
Self-hatred, guilt, it accomplishes nothing.
It just stands in the way.
Stands in the way of what?
True change.
Skyler, hi.
Is this a good time to talk?
Yeah.
Come in, please.
Skyler.
Um...
Do you want to start?
Okay.
Why-
- Why are you doing this?
Why are you even thinking this way?
Is it to punish me?
I am not punishing you, Walt.
This is punitive is what this is.
We are happily married.
I am happily married.
I am happy.
We're just--
I love you, Skyler, and I would do anything for you.
Would you even consider--
I mean, J----!
You come in here, and you wave these papers in my face, when there's a whole other entire side to this thing.
There's your side, and there's my side.
And you haven't heard my side yet.
You haven't heard any of it at all.
You're a drug dealer.
No.
What-
- How--
What?
Yeah.
How else could you possibly make that kind of money?
Marijuana.
That Pinkman kid.
No?
Oh, my God, Walt.
Cocaine?
It's methamphetamine.
But I-
- I'm--
I manufacture.
I am not a dealer.
Oh.
Per se.
It doesn't--
No, Skyler.
Listen to me, Skyler.
No.
Listen.
No.
There are a lot of angles to this, okay?
It's complicated, all right?
So please, let's--
Please, let's just sit back down, and we'll talk it through.
I'm gonna make you a deal, Walt.
I won't tell Hank, and I won't tell your children or anybody else.
Nobody will hear it from me, but only if you grant me this divorce and stay out of our lives.
No, Skyler.
I mean it.
Now let me the h- out of here before I throw up.
Your windshield's broken.
Yep.
A little friction in the marriage right now.
Strictly temporary.
We're just-- just taking a little break.
Uh, that's you over there.
Listen, um, money.
Saul has got it for you, and so as so as you're feeling better--
I'm better.
You're better.
Really?
What?
The rehab?
It helped?
Yeah.
I'm done using.
That's excellent.
That's--
That's very good, Jesse.
Boy-
- Very good.
You know, um... in spite of how bad things got, it really could be looked at like a wake-up call for th of us.
I mean, you know, just to get our-- our lives back together again and on the straight and narrow.
You been following this airplane crash?
Yeah.
You know it was Jane's dad who accidentally crashed them together?
Because he was so torn up?
Okay, look, let me stop you right there, all right?
You are not responsible for this-- not in any way, shape, or form, all right?
Now, I-
- I am very up-to-date on this thing, probably far more than you are, and there are-- there are many factors at play there.
Yeah?
For instance, there's some sort of collision radar on the jet that may not have been working properly.
Now, that's public record.
You can look that up.
And the whole system is run on-- on 1960s technology.
No.
No, really...
I blame the government.
You either run from things, or you face them, Mr. White.
And what exactly does that mean?
I learned it in rehab.
It's all about accepting who you really are.
I accept who I am.
And who are you?
I'm the bad guy.
Is the food to your satisfaction?
Very much.
It's good to see you again.
May I?
I have an offer that I think will be of interest to you.
I actually am not here to--
I'm here because I owe you the courtesy and respect to tell you this personally.
I'm done.
It has nothing to do with you personally.
I find you extraordinarily professional, and I appreciate the way you do business.
I'm just... making a change in my life is what it is, and I'm--
I'm at some- something of a crossroads.
It has brought me to a realization.
I am not a criminal.
No offense to any people who are.
But... this is not me.
I'd like you to hear my offer, notwithstanding.
It won't change my mind.
I'm sorry.
$3 million for three months of your time.
Three months, then out.
3 million?
May I take this as a yes?
I have money.
I have more money than know how to spend.
What I don't have is my family.
The answer is still no.
Enjoy your meal.
Thank you.

- Yeah.
No, I'm ready now.
Flynn, I'm taking you to school.
All right, I'm here.
See you soon.
Okay.
May I have your attention, please?
As all of you know, last week our city suffered a terrible tragedy.
One that none of us will ever forget.
Which is why today we're going to take a little time out of our schedule to gather in the gym and talk.
I just find it, you know, really, really hard to concentrate.
Because of all the horrors, you know, we perceived.
It just really gets inside your brain and...
In college, they have this thing where if your roommate kills himself like, if you come home and find him hanging in the closet or whatever it's basically an automatic A for you.
And I just think that that kind of compassion is...
- Is something to...
- Okay.
Thank you, Barry.
Who wants to go next?
No judgments, guys.
Just feelings.
You can say anything and everything that's on your mind.
Anyone?
There you go, honey.
I just keep asking myself...
Honey, could you please stand up?
Thank you.
I just keep asking myself, "Why did this happen?"
I mean, if there's a God and all why does he allow all those innocent people to die for no reason?
Okay, can we just keep it secular, honey?
Anyhow, I haven't really been sleeping much.
Does anyone else have that?
I just keep hearing that sound.
That boom.
It just plays over and over in my head like it won't ever stop.
Thank you, sweetheart.
- Is there anyone else?
- Over here.
My neighbor, he heard the crash and he ran outside, and he found, like, this seat.
Like an airline seat.
Like what you have on an airliner?
Well, anyway, the seat was standing perfectly upright in his front yard right next to his Sea-Doos, because, like, he has Sea-Doos.
But there was still a pair of legs buckled into them.
Human legs.
Jesus H. Christ.
- You okay?
- Yeah, sorry.
I'm...
I was just moved.
Maybe we should hear from the faculty.
Certainly this tragedy didn't only affect our students.
Mr. White, would you like to say something?
And by the way, welcome back.
It's so good to have you back.
I guess what I would...
Sorry, sorry.
I guess what I would wanna say is to look on the bright side.
First of all, nobody on the ground was killed.
And that...
I mean, an incident like this, over a populated urban center?
That right there, that's just gotta be some minor miracle.
So...
Plus, neither plane was full.
You know, the 737 was, what, maybe two-thirds full, I believe?
Right, yes?
Or maybe even three-quarters full?
Well, at any rate, what you're left with casualty-wise is just the 50th-worst air disaster.
Actually, tied for 50th.
There are, in truth 53 crashes throughout history that are just as bad or worse.
Tenerife.
Has anybody?
Anybody hear of Tenerife?
No?
In 1977, two fully loaded 747s crashed into each other on Tenerife.
Does anybody know how big a 747 is?
I mean, it's way bigger than a 737, and we're talking about two of them.
Nearly 600 people died on Tenerife.
But do any of you even remember it at all?
Any of you?
I doubt it.
You know why?
It's because people move on.
They just move on.
And we will too.
We will move on, and we will get past this.
Because that is what human beings do, we survive, and...
We survive and we overcome.
Yeah.
We survive.
We survive and...
- Okay?
- Thank you.
Good.
Hey, how's your Aunt Marie doing?
Fine.
I guess.
You make sure you say hello to her for me, will you?
Why don't you just come inside?
It's your house.
No, I...
He's gone.
Hey, Flynn.
How's tricks?
- How's what?
- Tricks.
It's an expression.
How are you?
Why you gotta treat him like this?
Why you gotta be like this?
- Why can't you just talk even?
- Hey, hey, hey.
Cool down, okay?
Out of the mouths of babes, huh?
You know, try not to hold it against him.
You know, I mean, the poor kid, he's probably just dying of curiosity.
You know, and I guess it would be natural for him to wonder.
He's probably wondering, "What is it that could have gone so wrong...
- Marie.
Marie.
- ...that my mother would leave...?"
I can't help you get through this you know, if you won't tell me what it is that Walt did?
Well, you know what, I don't remember asking you, all right?
So if you wanna be supportive, you could be supportive without prying.
- That would be really great...
- "Prying."
- ...and so helpful.
- Well, prying's a strong word.
It's that voice inside your head.
It's that sneaky, rat-bastard, 24/7 voice.
You know what I'm talking about.
That voice that tells you you're not good enough.
Not good enough for what?
Not good enough to be what president of the United States?
Well, okay, so maybe you're not that good.
But now are you good enough to deserve your share of basic human happiness?
Are you good enough to be okay with who and what you are?
I say yes.
But it doesn't matter what I say.
It's your voice, which means you're the one that hears it.
Which means you're the only one that can fight it, right?
Jesse, we never hear from you.
What's going on?
You can tell me I'm full of shit.
It's okay, I don't mind.
Just come on.
Let us in on it.
So, like, what makes you the expert?
I don't think I ever said I was that.
Yeah, but you're the one sitting here, right?
Telling us "thus" and "so," "be happy," "forgive yourself," blah, blah, blah.
Have you ever really hurt anybody?
I don't just mean disappointed your mother or whatever but did you ever really hurt someone?
I killed my daughter.
It was July 18th, which is my birthday.
July 18th, 1992.
I was high on cocaine and I was drunk.
Cocaine wasn't an issue.
I had bought myself two grams as a birthday present.
I had plenty left.
But I was out of vodka.
And this is in Portsmouth, Virginia where instead of selling liquor in the supermarkets they have these ABC stores which close at 5 p.m., and right then it was like 4:42.
So I'm arguing with my wife.
"Come on.
Go to the ABC for me, it's my birthday.
Come on.
They're not gonna sell it to me."
And she's saying "No, no."
So I'm pissed.
And the clock is ticking, so I jump in my truck.
She's my 6-year-old daughter.
She's playing at the end of the driveway.
So...
How do you not hate yourself?
I did hate myself for a long time.
But it didn't stop me from drinking and getting high.
It just made it that much worse.
Self-hatred, guilt, it accomplishes nothing.
It just stands in the way.
Stands in the way of what?
True change.
Skyler.
Is this a good time to talk?
Yeah.
Come in.
Please.
Skyler.
Do you wanna start?
Okay.
Why are you doing this?
Why are you even thinking this way?
- Is it to punish me?
- I am not punishing you, Walt.
This is punitive, is what this is.
We are happily married.
I am happily married.
I am happy.
We're just...
I love you, Skyler.
And I would do anything for you.
Would you even consider?
I mean, Jesus!
You come in here and you wave these papers in my face when there's a whole other, entire side to this thing.
There's your side and there's my side, and you haven't heard my side yet.
You haven't heard any of it at all.
You're a drug dealer.
No.
What...?
How?
What?
Yeah.
How else could you possibly make that kind of money?
Marijuana.
That Pinkman kid.
No?
Oh, my God, Walt.
Cocaine?
It's methamphetamine.
But I'm a manufacturer, I'm not a dealer per se.
It doesn't mean...
No, Skyler!
- Listen to me.
Skyler, listen...
- No, no!
There are a lot of angles to this, okay?
It's complicated, all right?
So please, let's...
Please, let's just sit back down and talk it through.
I'm gonna make you a deal, Walt.
I won't tell Hank and I won't tell your children or anybody else.
Nobody will hear it from me.
But only if you grant me this divorce and stay out of our lives.
- No, Skyler...
- I mean it.
Now let me the hell out of here before I throw up.
Bye, Jesse.
Your windshield's broken.
Yeah.
Little friction in the marriage right now.
Strictly temporary.
We're just...
We're just taking a little break.
That's you, over there.
Listen, money.
Saul has got it for you, so as soon as you're feeling better...
I'm better.
You're better?
Really?
- What, the rehab?
It helped?
- Yeah.
I'm done using.
That's excellent.
That's...
That's very good, Jesse.
Boy, very good.
You know, in spite of how bad things got it really could be looked at like a wake-up call for both of us.
I mean, you know, just to get our lives back together again and on the straight and narrow.
You been following this airplane crash?
Yeah.
You know it was Jane's dad who accidentally crashed them together because he was so torn up?
Okay, look, let me stop you right there, all right?
You are not responsible for this.
Not in any way, shape or form, all right?
Now, I am very up-to-date on this thing, probably far more than you are and there are many factors at play there.
Yeah?
For instance, there's some sort of collision radar on the jet that may not have been working.
That's public record.
You can look that up.
And the whole system is run on 1960s technology.
No.
No, really, I blame the government.
You either run from things or you face them, Mr. White.
- What exactly does that mean?
- I learned it in rehab.
It's all about accepting who you really are.
I accept who I am.
And who are you?
I'm the bad guy.
Here's some napkins for you.
Enjoy.
- Is the food to your satisfaction?
- Very much.
It's good to see you again.
- May I?
- Please.
I have an offer that I think will be of interest to you.
I actually am not here to...
I'm here because I owe you the courtesy and respect to tell you this personally.
I'm done.
It has nothing to do with you personally.
I find you extraordinarily professional and I appreciate the way you do business.
I'm just making a change in my life, is what it is.
And I'm...
I'm at something of a crossroads and it's brought me to a realization.
I am not a criminal.
No offense to any people who are but this is not me.
I'd like you to hear my offer, notwithstanding.
It won't change my mind, I'm sorry.
Three million dollars for three months of your time.
Three months, then out.
Three million?
May I take this as a "yes"?
I have money.
I have more money than I know how to spend.
What I don't have is my family.
The answer is still no.
Enjoy your meal.
Thank you.
That's it!
Did you feel it?
Texas!
I've made this trip three times and every time there's three big bumps and that's how you know!
We are officially in Texas!
This time I got a job waiting for me.
I got a cousin who's got a body shop.
Yo, that's for me, homes!
They call me "Olive Oil" because I paint them slick.
I do pearlescent, color-shift, you name it.
I painted cars for some of the biggest gangsters in Michoacán.
Wow, those are beautiful boots!
Not much good for working, but...
Hey, what's on the toes there?
Little silver...
What the hell's going on in there?
Subs collected, corrected and if necessary adapted by TRONAR for "Breaking Bad Season 1, 2, 3, 4 5 + Extras BDRip DVDRip HDTV TSV"
The postman just looked at my tits!
Yeah, he does that.
You're supposed to be planning us a route across Mexico.
Sorry, I got bored waiting for my garibaldis.
Can you turn away a minute?
Turn back.
I saw these a while ago, and...
I love you.
Yeah, I know.
Don't forget it, though.
How do I look?
What are you doing?
Just clearing some space.
Fitch hug.
You too, big man.
Oh, Mum.
He wants to hug me again.
Hug your father.
Emily, in here, please.
Can you take that stupid thing off your head?
We need to talk about your options for next year.
I'm going to Mexico with Naomi.
Don't worry.
It's all worked out.
Well, a lot can change in a year, missy.
Why don't you look at these in the meantime?
Have you seen my phone?
You have six missed calls.
All from me.
Morning, Jenna.
You're looking very beautiful today.
See you at lunch.
Yeah.
See you.
What's the matter?
Forgot for a second.
Ah, girls.
Good.
Follow me.
Actually, don't.
We're late.
Frankly, Emily, I don't give a damn.
The police are back and they want to talk to you both about Sophia Moore.
So come along, ladies.
This way.
So, how close were you to Sophia?
We didn't know her.
- Did you know her, Emily?
- No.
You sure?
We heard you three were quite chummy.
Well, we weren't.
Have you ever used MDMA?
Uh... it's illegal.
We found traces of it in Sophia's blood.
We think she might have bought it in the club.
Did you see Sophia at the party?
We only saw her...
We were only at the party for ten minutes or so.
We went home long before...
before the accident.
We didn't see her.
Emily said you did.
Um... no.
I meant since the party.
There's been posters everywhere.
What are you looking for, exactly?
Just want more of a complete picture.
We just want the truth.
Why did we just lie to the police?
Hey.
It's me.
What's going on?
I did see her at the party.
It was me who sold her the MDMA.
Since when are you dealing?
I needed some money and I thought if I just went in on this MDMA...
I could have lent you some money.
It was for these.
I thought I could keep you safe.
I'm sorry.
Who gave you the MDMA?
- Why did you give them our names?
- Em, calm down.
Course I didn't, man.
Chillax.
- They ain't got nothing on us.
- And you know that, do you?
I nicked the fella's briefcase.
He's a fucking Bristol Rovers fan.
His mum leaves notes in his sandwiches.
Look at that.
- But what if they do know?
- That's what'll fuck this.
Getting scared, poking around, causing a fucking scene in the corridors.
- He's right.
- Mum's the word, girls.
Don't you want to know why they had our names?
No!
- Why not?
- Because I don't want to go to jail.
Could you just mind your own fucking business for once, please?
Ok.
Sorry.
We just have to act like everything's fine.
See you later.
Hello.
Hi.
I'm a friend of Sophia's.
Thank you for the flowers.
Sorry.
What was your name again?
Nancy.
She never mentioned a Nancy.
But that's Sophia for you.
Secretive.
How did you know her?
Just from... college and stuff.
Are you in with Naomi and Emily and that crowd?
Um... yeah.
I see them sometimes.
I thought they'd have called round by now.
- Sophia talked about them nonstop.
- Did she?
Did she ever talk to you about me?
Yeah...
Yeah.
She really...
loved you.
You're lying to me.
It's kind of you.
Hi, Matt.
This is Nancy.
Friend of your sister's.
I'm going upstairs.
Would you like to see her room?
She never used to let me go in there.
It was always so messy.
If you want a memento, just...
just let me see what you've taken.
I'll leave you to it.
What are you doing?
Nothing.
What's your name again?
- Nancy.
- Sophia never mentioned a Nancy.
Did you know someone gave her drugs the night she died?
I didn't know.
Were you her girlfriend?
What?
No.
Girlfriend?
You're fucking lying to me.
They're saying she killed herself.
That's bollocks.
I know she didn't do that.
How?
Cos she didn't say goodbye to me.
I'm so sorry.
I found this.
Get out.
Hi, chicken.
What's the matter?
Is my mum here?
Is it... whatshisname?
JJ?
Your mum said he was nice.
JJ?
Now, if he's cheated on you, love, the thing to remember about young boys is that most of them would fuck a snake if you put make-up on it.
You can't take it personally.
Hmm?
You told Graham I was straight?
Well, he's known you since you were a little girl.
He's gay as a window!
He's an adult.
He's earned the right to be gay.
You're too young to know what you are.
I know, Mum.
Oh, you bastard!
You think you know.
Is there any specific reason why you've been crying?
Maybe Naomi?
No, we're fine.
You should go travelling to find yourself.
Wouldn't she just get in the way?
She's my fucking girlfriend!
You've got nothing to do with this.
All right.
All right!
Wouldn't you like to set out on an adventure?
No!
Get used to it!
So... what if I was to give you lb1,000?
- Would that change things?
- What?
!
- Now you're bribing me.
- Oh, Emily.
Your mind!
I'm just trying to help you.
Naomi's not right for you.
And there's something about her... something I don't quite like.
I'm just telling you.
Shove it up your tits.
Jen, please, they're planning work down there.
- So how was your bath?
- What bath?
The one you popped home to take about three months ago.
Right.
I went to Italy.
Italy?
Si.
How was your summer?
Not bad.
Got chlamydia.
- Wow!
Exotic.
- That's what I said.
Then I realised Cook had it as well and it didn't feel quite so special, if you know what I mean.
I bet it liked you more.
So, who gave it to who?
We didn't.
There was an intermediary.
And you're... all clear now?
Oh!
Yeah, fine now.
Clear as a... bell.
Not sure about him, though.
It's you I spent all summer thinking about.
So what is it?
Is it my food or my winning personality today?
Have you ever...
loved someone and then... something happens and... you wonder if perhaps you didn't ever know them at all?
Do you trust her?
What?
No?
- What?
No, I don't need to.
- But... if you two got together, wouldn't you be worried she might fuck Cook again?
That hurt!
Emily, I'm sorry.
I'm just a bit busy at the minute, ok?
Why didn't you tell me you knew her?
I met her once, at an open day.
What open day?
It was an open day.
What does it matter?
We're going travelling next year.
We decided.
You decided.
Look, I went to an open day,
I met a girl, we talked... that's it.
You should have told me.
Well, how could I, without telling you where I met her?
I didn't want a referendum on our relationship over a stupid open day.
- Did you know she was gay?
- I met her once.
Did you fuck her?
No!
You think I'd shag some random girl behind your back?
I'm not saying you did it.
Well, what are you saying?
- I'm just asking.
- Why are you acting like this?
- Her mum seems to think we knew her.
- What?
I went to her house today.
You promised me you'd stay out of it.
Stay out of it.
Do you know what this is for?
Something to do with the Army.
Probably her cadet locker key.
How do you even know that, Naomi?
Where are you going?
I'm going to find out if you're lying.
Oh, nice!
Let's go, then.
Fine.
Left!
Right!
Left!
Right!
Left!
Right!
Left!
Right!
What the fuck?
That's my old toothbrush.
It's your bracelet.
Is this the one you lost?
She went through my rubbish.
Close it.
Please, close it.
It's ok.
Left!
Right!
Left!
Right!
Left!
Right!
Left!
Right!
Left!
Right!
Left!
Right!
Left!
Left!
Right!
Left!
Left!
Right!
Left!
Right!
Left!
Right!
Left!
Right!
Left!
Return!
She stalked me.
You're very stalkable.
One, two, three, four.
Sam's a post room co-ordinator.
Oh, very nice.
Oh, yeah.
He's, like, responsible.
Aren't you, sweetie?
Yeah, babe.
No more room for carrot flan, Rob?
Think I've had too much of a good thing, love.
I love carrots.
This stuff is off the hook, Jenna.
Oh, thank you, Samuel.
That is so sweet of you.
This one's a keeper, isn't he, Katie-kins?
He's an arse-licker is what he is.
But we're letting that one go.
Well.
Is Naomi coming?
No, Naomi couldn't make it.
Oh.
I wanted to show her my new number.
Stop calling it a number.
A lot of boys become very curious in women's clothing once they approach pub-erty.
It's called pu-berty, little dude.
Sam's really clever.
Ain't you, babes?
- Why is he here?
- Because he's my new boyfriend.
Eat your flan.
You said Naomi couldn't come to a family dinner.
This is a six-seater table, Emily.
What do you want me to do?
Anyway, this dinner is a happy time because yesterday I got my kick-starter takeoff loan approved.
Loan?
As from next week, I'm quitting the salon and will become the managing director of Bristol's premier new wedding-planning service...
Let's Get Fitched!
Let's Get Fitched?
Let's Get Fitched... get it?
Yeah.
That's good.
Yeah, but...
I thought we were going to talk about that.
We did, Rob.
And we decided.
This is my shimmering dream.
Ah!
Toast?
Word.
Got the really expensive stuff as well.
I've lost the gym.
What?
I've lost it, love.
No!
But that's your gym, Rob.
It's the bank's gym now.
You're unemployed?
YYeah, love.
I'm bankrupt.
But don't worry.
I've got an inside tip that they're going to be recruiting at Virgin Active.
But what about money?
I mean, we need money.
I was going to give Emily money.
- I don't want it.
- What money?
She was going to bribe me not to go travelling with Naomi.
It is not a bribe.
It's just money I promised my daughter.
Yeah?
Well, where's my money?
No-one's getting any money.
- I'm giving Emily money.
- I don't want it.
Don't you get it?
I want Naomi.
I want to fuck Naomi.
What?
I do.
Get over it.
Rob!
Did you just hear what he said?
She is attractive, love.
Fuck, Rob!
He said "fuck"!
Now do you see what she's done to our family?
- I'm moving out.
- Don't be rash, love.
Britney, stop saying "fuck".
Emsy, sit down.
No.
I don't want to live here any more.
Fine.
Get out.
Go on.
Get out!
You're not welcome in this home any more!
You or Naomi!
You or Naomi!
That's my top.
That's my top.
You know Mum doesn't mean to be a total bitch.
Yes, she does.
And you let her.
She's trying to help you.
It's all fake.
This whole family's fake.
I'm not fake.
Fake tan?
Fake boyfriend.
Fake concern.
I am concerned!
Bitch!
And for your information, I was in the sun for five hours today.
And as for my boyfriend, he may be little, but for your further information, he's sweet, trustworthy and totally hung, ok?
Who said I was little?
Can you get the fuck out, babes?
He's definitely a keeper.
God, you're a selfish cow.
- Oh, fuck off, Kate.
- Please don't go.
I'll back you up.
Emsy, do no go.
Emsy tum.
You want to pick a better fake name next time.
There's no Nancys at Roundview.
And only one red-haired girl with a moped.
- You've been checking up on me?
- You lied.
I think it's pretty clear.
She killed herself.
No.
And it wasn't Naomi, ok?
She didn't know either of us.
She lied about that.
- She wouldn't lie to me.
- She lied to everyone!
I'm sorry you feel angry at her but it's really not my fucking problem.
I need the truth.
This isn't all of it.
No.
Emily, what are you scared of?
We can help each other.
Is it so out of the question that I might know what's best?
I'm not talking to you.
Emily.
I don't want you to move out.
I don't care.
I'm just trying to help you!
Fuck off!
"What is it, Sophia?
What did you lock up?"
Yes.
Fucking...
Oh, no.
It's ok.
It's just Emily.
Bonsoir.
Who was that?
Oh, just my mum.
What's all this?
I'm moving in.
Where?
Here.
Uh... isn't that the sort of thing people usually discuss?
I need to, ok?
OK.
- Ok?
- Ok!
Although, in many ways, it's sort of a violation.
But fuck it.
It's ok.
Really?
Really!
It'll be great.
You can be my pyjamas.
You need to do something about your moustache.
What?
Shit!
Shit!
Shit!
Shit!
This is just kind of terrible.
Yeah.
Fuck it!
If it's rubbish, we'll just go back to ours.
Ours.
Naomi!
Stay alive!
I will find you.
Hi.
How you doing?
This is the worst party I've ever been to.
The worst.
Really?
Panda's giving Thommo a dose of the old look-at-me routine.
You know how it is... letting your exes know that you're out there, that other people find you attractive...
That everything you thought you had together... they can do without it.
That they don't need you.
That guy over there keeps staring at you.
I merely observed.
Let it go.
Let it go before you screw everything up.
Cook, excuse me?
I don't want to see your muff.
Emilio looks jealous.
It's probably still not too late to be overcome by desire with me.
I could turn you, deffo.
Fuck off.
No, I'm serious.
It's probably been a while, innit, since you've seen one of these.
Look, mine is totally oustanding, man.
What's up, Emilio, man?
Why are you hiding in the pisser?
Do you ever get jealous, Cook?
If your shag's a shag, then you're always going to get your heart ripped out somewhere, aren't you?
What do you do about it?
You just burn, kid.
You just burn.
You just keep it on the inside.
Is that possible?
Yeah.
Cos you look a bit stupid if you don't, don't you?
Look at me, love.
Happy.
Effy.
You don't tell any of my secrets and I won't tell any of yours.
Or we could just go out there in a blaze of glory.
Dance, my flunky?
- You got it.
- Come on, then, kid.
Oh, sorry.
- Cook!
- Get off me now.
Get off!
Fucking!
What are you doing?
!
That's all!
Who fucking wants one now?
I need to see you.
"No, now.
I've got something I need to show you.
Tonight."
Why did you?
Why here?
I dunno.
This is where it ends.
I've got something to show you.
I think she wanted you to have this.
I got it from her cadet locker.
I need to know what's in there.
Me too.
It's her work... her diary, you know?
Can't we just leave it?
I don't think we can, Naomes.
She's dead.
Let it go.
I can't.
See you round.
Can't we just go home?
Matt, come back!
Emily, please!
Emily!
Wait!
Please!
Can't we just go home?
I don't think so.
I made this for her.
Woodwork, you know?
Yeah.
"I can't stop crying."
"I've tried to stop thinking, but it doesn't work.
You don't expect stuff to happen.
You can't control it.
You can't control anything.
So I'm at this stupid open day and everyone's snotty and rude, and then I see someone.
I'd never even spoken to her at Roundview.
It didn't seem to matter because then everything got really fun.
And by the time we were on our way home, we were telling secrets.
I wanted to move my hand.
I wanted to move it so much.
And then she moved hers.
I wish I'd told Naomi how easy it is for me to love someone.
We're all lonely and all we want is for someone to... you know, pay attention and tell us we're beautiful and cute and say that they want to..."
I don't believe it.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry!
You've ruined it.
You don't want anyone to care.
I could be dead in a second.
Everything's... so... fragile.
Didn't you realise that?
We were special.
- I was scared!
- You're always scared.
Emily!
Emily!
Naomi cheated.
And...
I don't know why she did that.
Oh, love.
Sweet girl.
I hate her.
- I know you do.
- I hate her!
I know, love.
It's ok.
Listen, I want to tell you something.
Listen to me.
You know, I cheated on your mum once.
What?
I was young.
I was too young.
I was 19.
I'd been married for two years.
Her family always saying what's what.
Scottish people.
God knows I regretted it.
Your Aunty Julie's no better-looking now than what she was then.
Her sister!
People do stupid things when they're trying to act like they're not trapped.
Was it ever the same again?
It was worse.
And then it was ok.
Then it got better.
And then we got you.
We got all the things we love.
Did she hate herself for taking you back?
What?
Hate herself?
What for?
She didn't do anything wrong.
She hated me, though.
For a very, very, very long time.
She's tough, your mum, you know.
You want to be glad of that.
I'm not like her, Dad.
That's ok, too.
The police would like to interview you all.
Somebody gave that girl drugs.
- So?
- I'll fucking...
Thomas!
It was me!
Cook dealt me the powder.
What?
!
I slept with someone who wasn't you.
What?
!
I told him I never want to see him.
Well done.
He needs to think about what he did.
I'm going to... expel you.
The postman just looked at my tits!
Yeah, he does that.
You're supposed to be planning us a route across Mexico.
Sorry, I got bored waiting for my garibaldis.
Can you turn away a minute?
Turn back.
I saw these a while ago, and...
I love you.
Yeah, I know.
Don't forget it, though.
How do I look?
What are you doing?
Just clearing some space.
Fitch hug.
You too, big man.
Oh, Mum.
He wants to hug me again.
Hug your father.
Emily, in here, please.
Can you take that stupid thing off your head?
We need to talk about your options for next year.
I'm going to Mexico with Naomi.
Don't worry.
It's all worked out.
Well, a lot can change in a year, missy.
Why don't you look at these in the meantime?
Have you seen my phone?
You have six missed calls.
All from me.
Morning, Jenna.
You're looking very beautiful today.
See you at lunch.
Yeah.
See you.
What's the matter?
Forgot for a second.
Ah, girls.
Good.
Follow me.
Actually, don't.
We're late.
Frankly, Emily, I don't give a damn.
The police are back and they want to talk to you both about Sophia Moore.
So come along, ladies.
This way.
So, how close were you to Sophia?
We didn't know her.
- Did you know her, Emily?
- No.
You sure?
We heard you three were quite chummy.
Well, we weren't.
Have you ever used MDMA?
Uh... it's illegal.
We found traces of it in Sophia's blood.
We think she might have bought it in the club.
Did you see Sophia at the party?
We only saw her...
We were only at the party for ten minutes or so.
We went home long before...
before the accident.
We didn't see her.
Emily said you did.
Um... no.
I meant since the party.
There's been posters everywhere.
What are you looking for, exactly?
Just want more of a complete picture.
We just want the truth.
Why did we just lie to the police?
Hey.
It's me.
What's going on?
I did see her at the party.
It was me who sold her the MDMA.
Since when are you dealing?
I needed some money and I thought if I just went in on this MDMA...
I could have lent you some money.
It was for these.
I thought I could keep you safe.
I'm sorry.
Who gave you the MDMA?
- Why did you give them our names?
- Em, calm down.
Course I didn't, man.
Chillax.
- They ain't got nothing on us.
- And you know that, do you?
I nicked the fella's briefcase.
He's a fucking Bristol Rovers fan.
His mum leaves notes in his sandwiches.
Look at that.
- But what if they do know?
- That's what'll fuck this.
Getting scared, poking around, causing a fucking scene in the corridors.
- He's right.
- Mum's the word, girls.
Don't you want to know why they had our names?
No!
- Why not?
- Because I don't want to go to jail.
Could you just mind your own fucking business for once, please?
Ok.
Sorry.
We just have to act like everything's fine.
See you later.
Hello.
Hi.
I'm a friend of Sophia's.
Thank you for the flowers.
Sorry.
What was your name again?
Nancy.
She never mentioned a Nancy.
But that's Sophia for you.
Secretive.
How did you know her?
Just from... college and stuff.
Are you in with Naomi and Emily and that crowd?
Um... yeah.
I see them sometimes.
I thought they'd have called round by now.
- Sophia talked about them nonstop.
- Did she?
Did she ever talk to you about me?
Yeah...
Yeah.
She really...
loved you.
You're lying to me.
It's kind of you.
Hi, Matt.
This is Nancy.
Friend of your sister's.
I'm going upstairs.
Would you like to see her room?
She never used to let me go in there.
It was always so messy.
If you want a memento, just...
just let me see what you've taken.
I'll leave you to it.
What are you doing?
Nothing.
What's your name again?
- Nancy.
- Sophia never mentioned a Nancy.
Did you know someone gave her drugs the night she died?
I didn't know.
Were you her girlfriend?
What?
No.
Girlfriend?
You're fucking lying to me.
They're saying she killed herself.
That's bollocks.
I know she didn't do that.
How?
Cos she didn't say goodbye to me.
I'm so sorry.
I found this.
Get out.
Hi, chicken.
What's the matter?
Is my mum here?
Is it... whatshisname?
JJ?
Your mum said he was nice.
JJ?
Now, if he's cheated on you, love, the thing to remember about young boys is that most of them would fuck a snake if you put make-up on it.
You can't take it personally.
Hmm?
You told Graham I was straight?
Well, he's known you since you were a little girl.
He's gay as a window!
He's an adult.
He's earned the right to be gay.
You're too young to know what you are.
I know, Mum.
Oh, you bastard!
You think you know.
Is there any specific reason why you've been crying?
Maybe Naomi?
No, we're fine.
You should go travelling to find yourself.
Wouldn't she just get in the way?
She's my fucking girlfriend!
You've got nothing to do with this.
All right.
All right!
Wouldn't you like to set out on an adventure?
No!
Get used to it!
So... what if I was to give you £1,000?
- Would that change things?
- What?
!
- Now you're bribing me.
- Oh, Emily.
Your mind!
I'm just trying to help you.
Naomi's not right for you.
And there's something about her... something I don't quite like.
I'm just telling you.
Shove it up your tits.
Jen, please, they're planning work down there.
- So how was your bath?
- What bath?
The one you popped home to take about three months ago.
Right.
I went to Italy.
Italy?
Si.
How was your summer?
Not bad.
Got chlamydia.
- Wow!
Exotic.
- That's what I said.
Then I realised Cook had it as well and it didn't feel quite so special, if you know what I mean.
I bet it liked you more.
So, who gave it to who?
We didn't.
There was an intermediary.
And you're... all clear now?
Oh!
Yeah, fine now.
Clear as a... bell.
Not sure about him, though.
It's you I spent all summer thinking about.
So what is it?
Is it my food or my winning personality today?
Have you ever...
loved someone and then... something happens and... you wonder if perhaps you didn't ever know them at all?
Do you trust her?
What?
No?
- What?
No, I don't need to.
- But... if you two got together, wouldn't you be worried she might fuck Cook again?
That hurt!
Emily, I'm sorry.
I'm just a bit busy at the minute, ok?
Why didn't you tell me you knew her?
I met her once, at an open day.
What open day?
It was an open day.
What does it matter?
We're going travelling next year.
We decided.
You decided.
Look, I went to an open day,
I met a girl, we talked... that's it.
You should have told me.
Well, how could I, without telling you where I met her?
I didn't want a referendum on our relationship over a stupid open day.
- Did you know she was gay?
- I met her once.
Did you fuck her?
No!
You think I'd shag some random girl behind your back?
I'm not saying you did it.
Well, what are you saying?
- I'm just asking.
- Why are you acting like this?
- Her mum seems to think we knew her.
- What?
I went to her house today.
You promised me you'd stay out of it.
Stay out of it.
Do you know what this is for?
Something to do with the Army.
Probably her cadet locker key.
How do you even know that, Naomi?
Where are you going?
I'm going to find out if you're lying.
Oh, nice!
Let's go, then.
Fine.
Left!
Right!
Left!
Right!
Left!
Right!
Left!
Right!
What the fuck?
That's my old toothbrush.
It's your bracelet.
Is this the one you lost?
She went through my rubbish.
Close it.
Please, close it.
It's ok.
Left!
Right!
Left!
Right!
Left!
Right!
Left!
Right!
Left!
Right!
Left!
Right!
Left!
Left!
Right!
Left!
Left!
Right!
Left!
Right!
Left!
Right!
Left!
Right!
Left!
Return!
She stalked me.
You're very stalkable.
One, two, three, four.
Sam's a post room co-ordinator.
Oh, very nice.
Oh, yeah.
He's, like, responsible.
Aren't you, sweetie?
Yeah, babe.
No more room for carrot flan, Rob?
Think I've had too much of a good thing, love.
I love carrots.
This stuff is off the hook, Jenna.
Oh, thank you, Samuel.
That is so sweet of you.
This one's a keeper, isn't he, Katie-kins?
He's an arse-licker is what he is.
But we're letting that one go.
Well.
Is Naomi coming?
No, Naomi couldn't make it.
Oh.
I wanted to show her my new number.
Stop calling it a number.
A lot of boys become very curious in women's clothing once they approach pub-erty.
It's called pu-berty, little dude.
Sam's really clever.
Ain't you, babes?
- Why is he here?
- Because he's my new boyfriend.
Eat your flan.
You said Naomi couldn't come to a family dinner.
This is a six-seater table, Emily.
What do you want me to do?
Anyway, this dinner is a happy time because yesterday I got my kick-starter takeoff loan approved.
Loan?
As from next week, I'm quitting the salon and will become the managing director of Bristol's premier new wedding-planning service...
Let's Get Fitched!
Let's Get Fitched?
Let's Get Fitched... get it?
Yeah.
That's good.
Yeah, but...
I thought we were going to talk about that.
We did, Rob.
And we decided.
This is my shimmering dream.
Ah!
Toast?
Word.
Got the really expensive stuff as well.
I've lost the gym.
What?
I've lost it, love.
No!
But that's your gym, Rob.
It's the bank's gym now.
You're unemployed?
YYeah, love.
I'm bankrupt.
But don't worry.
I've got an inside tip that they're going to be recruiting at Virgin Active.
But what about money?
I mean, we need money.
I was going to give Emily money.
- I don't want it.
- What money?
She was going to bribe me not to go travelling with Naomi.
It is not a bribe.
It's just money I promised my daughter.
Yeah?
Well, where's my money?
No-one's getting any money.
- I'm giving Emily money.
- I don't want it.
Don't you get it?
I want Naomi.
I want to fuck Naomi.
What?
I do.
Get over it.
Rob!
Did you just hear what he said?
She is attractive, love.
Fuck, Rob!
He said "fuck"!
Now do you see what she's done to our family?
- I'm moving out.
- Don't be rash, love.
Britney, stop saying "fuck".
Emsy, sit down.
No.
I don't want to live here any more.
Fine.
Get out.
Go on.
Get out!
You're not welcome in this home any more!
You or Naomi!
You or Naomi!
That's my top.
That's my top.
You know Mum doesn't mean to be a total bitch.
Yes, she does.
And you let her.
She's trying to help you.
It's all fake.
This whole family's fake.
I'm not fake.
Fake tan?
Fake boyfriend.
Fake concern.
I am concerned!
Bitch!
And for your information, I was in the sun for five hours today.
And as for my boyfriend, he may be little, but for your further information, he's sweet, trustworthy and totally hung, ok?
Who said I was little?
Can you get the fuck out, babes?
He's definitely a keeper.
God, you're a selfish cow.
- Oh, fuck off, Kate.
- Please don't go.
I'll back you up.
Emsy, do no go.
Emsy tum.
You want to pick a better fake name next time.
There's no Nancys at Roundview.
And only one red-haired girl with a moped.
- You've been checking up on me?
- You lied.
I think it's pretty clear.
She killed herself.
No.
And it wasn't Naomi, ok?
She didn't know either of us.
She lied about that.
- She wouldn't lie to me.
- She lied to everyone!
I'm sorry you feel angry at her but it's really not my fucking problem.
I need the truth.
This isn't all of it.
No.
Emily, what are you scared of?
We can help each other.
Is it so out of the question that I might know what's best?
I'm not talking to you.
Emily.
I don't want you to move out.
I don't care.
I'm just trying to help you!
Fuck off!
"What is it, Sophia?
What did you lock up?"
Yes.
Fucking...
Oh, no.
It's ok.
It's just Emily.
Bonsoir.
Who was that?
Oh, just my mum.
What's all this?
I'm moving in.
Where?
Here.
Uh... isn't that the sort of thing people usually discuss?
I need to, ok?
OK.
- Ok?
- Ok!
Although, in many ways, it's sort of a violation.
But fuck it.
It's ok.
Really?
Really!
It'll be great.
You can be my pyjamas.
You need to do something about your moustache.
What?
Shit!
Shit!
Shit!
Shit!
This is just kind of terrible.
Yeah.
Fuck it!
If it's rubbish, we'll just go back to ours.
Ours.
Naomi!
Stay alive!
I will find you.
Hi.
How you doing?
This is the worst party I've ever been to.
The worst.
Really?
Panda's giving Thommo a dose of the old look-at-me routine.
You know how it is... letting your exes know that you're out there, that other people find you attractive...
That everything you thought you had together... they can do without it.
That they don't need you.
That guy over there keeps staring at you.
I merely observed.
Let it go.
Let it go before you screw everything up.
Cook, excuse me?
I don't want to see your muff.
Emilio looks jealous.
It's probably still not too late to be overcome by desire with me.
I could turn you, deffo.
Fuck off.
No, I'm serious.
It's probably been a while, innit, since you've seen one of these.
Look, mine is totally oustanding, man.
What's up, Emilio, man?
Why are you hiding in the pisser?
Do you ever get jealous, Cook?
If your shag's a shag, then you're always going to get your heart ripped out somewhere, aren't you?
What do you do about it?
You just burn, kid.
You just burn.
You just keep it on the inside.
Is that possible?
Yeah.
Cos you look a bit stupid if you don't, don't you?
Look at me, love.
Happy.
Effy.
You don't tell any of my secrets and I won't tell any of yours.
Or we could just go out there in a blaze of glory.
Dance, my flunky?
- You got it.
- Come on, then, kid.
Oh, sorry.
- Cook!
- Get off me now.
Get off!
Fucking!
What are you doing?
!
That's all!
Who fucking wants one now?
I need to see you.
"No, now.
I've got something I need to show you.
Tonight."
Why did you?
Why here?
I dunno.
This is where it ends.
I've got something to show you.
I think she wanted you to have this.
I got it from her cadet locker.
I need to know what's in there.
Me too.
It's her work... her diary, you know?
Can't we just leave it?
I don't think we can, Naomes.
She's dead.
Let it go.
I can't.
See you round.
Can't we just go home?
Matt, come back!
Emily, please!
Emily!
Wait!
Please!
Can't we just go home?
I don't think so.
I made this for her.
Woodwork, you know?
Yeah.
"I can't stop crying."
"I've tried to stop thinking, but it doesn't work.
You don't expect stuff to happen.
You can't control it.
You can't control anything.

I don't believe it.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry!
You've ruined it.
You don't want anyone to care.
I could be dead in a second.
Everything's... so... fragile.
Didn't you realise that?
We were special.
- I was scared!
- You're always scared.
Emily!
Emily!
Naomi cheated.
And...
I don't know why she did that.
Oh, love.
Sweet girl.
I hate her.
- I know you do.
- I hate her!
I know, love.
It's ok.
Listen, I want to tell you something.
Listen to me.
You know, I cheated on your mum once.
What?
I was young.
I was too young.
I was 19.
I'd been married for two years.
Her family always saying what's what.

God knows I regretted it.

And then it was ok.

And then we got you.
We got all the things we love.
Did she hate herself for taking you back?
What?
Hate herself?
What for?
She didn't do anything wrong.
She hated me, though.
For a very, very, very long time.
She's tough, your mum, you know.
You want to be glad of that.
I'm not like her, Dad.
That's ok, too.

Just from... college and stuff.
Are you in with Naomi and Emily and that crowd?
Um... yeah.
I see them sometimes.
I thought they'd have called round by now.
- Sophia talked about them nonstop.
- Did she?
Did she ever talk to you about me?
Yeah...
Yeah.
She really...
loved you.
You're lying to me.
It's kind of you.
Hi, Matt.
This is Nancy.
Friend of your sister's.
I'm going upstairs.
Would you like to see her room?
She never used to let me go in there.
It was always so messy.
If you want a memento, just...
just let me see what you've taken.
I'll leave you to it.
What are you doing?
Nothing.
What's your name again?
- Nancy.
- Sophia never mentioned a Nancy.
Did you know someone gave her drugs the night she died?
I didn't know.
Were you her girlfriend?
What?
No.
Girlfriend?
You're fucking lying to me.
They're saying she killed herself.
That's bollocks.
I know she didn't do that.
How?
Cos she didn't say goodbye to me.
I'm so sorry.
I found this.
Get out.
Hi, chicken.
What's the matter?
Is my mum here?
Is it... whatshisname?
JJ?
Your mum said he was nice.
JJ?
Now, if he's cheated on you, love, the thing to remember about young boys is that most of them would fuck a snake if you put make-up on it.
You can't take it personally.
Hmm?
You told Graham I was straight?
Well, he's known you since you were a little girl.
He's gay as a window!
He's an adult.
He's earned the right to be gay.
You're too young to know what you are.
I know, Mum.
Oh, you bastard!
You think you know.
Is there any specific reason why you've been crying?
Maybe Naomi?
No, we're fine.
You should go travelling to find yourself.
Wouldn't she just get in the way?
She's my fucking girlfriend!
You've got nothing to do with this.
All right.
All right!
Wouldn't you like to set out on an adventure on your...
No!
Get used to it!
So... what if I was to give you £1,000?
- Would that change things?
- What?
!
- Now you're bribing me.
- Oh, Emily.
You're mine!
I'm just trying to help you.
Naomi's not right for you.
And there's something about her... something I don't quite like.
I'm just telling you.
Shove it up your tits.
Please, they're planning work down there.
- So how was your bath?
- What bath?
The one you popped home to take about three months ago.
Right.
I went to Italy.
Italy?
Si.
How was your summer?
Not bad.
Got chlamydia.
- Wow!
Exotic.
- That's what I said.
Then I realised Cook had it as well and it didn't feel quite so special, if you know what I mean.
I bet it liked you more.
So, who gave it to who?
We didn't.
There was an intermediary.
And you're... all clear now?
Oh!
Yeah, fine now.
Clear as a... bell.
Not sure about him, though.
It's you I spent all summer thinking about.
So what is it?
Is it my food or my winning personality today?
Have you ever...
loved someone and then... something happens and... you wonder if perhaps you didn't ever know them at all?
Do you trust her?
What?
No?
- What?
No, I don't need to.
- But... if you two got together, wouldn't you be worried she might fuck Cook again?
That hurt!
Emily, I'm sorry.
I'm just a bit busy at the minute, ok?
Why didn't you tell me you knew her?
I met her once, at an open day.
What open day?
It was an open day.
What does it matter?
We're going travelling next year.
We decided.
You decided.
Look, I went to an open day,
I met a girl, we talked... that's it.
You should have told me.
Well, how could I, without telling you where I met her?
I didn't want a referendum on our relationship over a stupid open day.
- Did you know she was gay?
- I met her once.
Did you fuck her?
No!
You think I'd shag some random girl behind your back?
I'm not saying you did it.
Well, what are you saying?
- I'm just asking.
- Why are you acting like this?
- Her mum seems to think we knew her.
- What?
I went to her house today.
You promised me you'd stay out of it.
Stay out of it.
Do you know what this is for?
Something to do with the Army.
Probably her cadet locker key.
How do you even know that, Naomi?
Where are you going?
I'm going to find out if you're lying.
Oh, nice!
Let's go, then.
Fine.
Left!
Right!
Left!
Right!
Left!
Right!
Left!
Right!
What the fuck?
That's my old toothbrush.
It's your bracelet.
Is this the one you lost?
She went through my rubbish.
Close it.
Please, close it.
It's ok.
Left!
Right!
Left!
Right!
Left!
Right!
Left!
Right!
Left!
Right!
Left!
Right!
Left!
Left!
Right!
Left!
Left!
Right!
Left!
Right!
Left!
Right!
Left!
Right!
Left!
Return!
She stalked me.
You're very stalkable.
Sam's a post room co-ordinator.
Oh, very nice.
Oh, yeah.
He's, like, responsible.
Aren't you, sweetie?
Yeah, babe.
No more room for carrot flan, Rob?
Think I've had too much of a good thing, love.
I love carrots.
This stuff is off the hook, Jenna.
Oh, thank you, Samuel.
That is so sweet of you.
This one's a keeper, isn't he, Katie-kins?
He's an arse-licker is what he is.
But we're letting that one go.
Well.
Is Naomi coming?
No, Naomi couldn't make it.
Oh.
I wanted to show her my new number.
Stop calling it a number.
A lot of boys become very curious in women's clothing once they approach pub-erty.
It's called pu-berty, little dude.
Sam's really clever.
Ain't you, babes?
- Why is he here?
- Because he's my new boyfriend.
- Eat your flan.
- You said Naomi couldn't come to a family dinner.
This is a six-seater table, Emily.
What do you want me to do?
Anyway, this dinner is a happy time because yesterday I got my kick-starter takeoff loan approved.
Loan?
As from next week, I'm quitting the salon and will become the managing director of Bristol's premier new wedding-planning service...
Let's Get Fitched!
Let's Get Fitched?
Let's Get Fitched... get it?
Yeah.
That's good.
Yeah, but...
I thought we were going to talk about that.
We did, Rob.
And we decided.
This is my shimmering dream.
Ah!
Toast?
Word.
Got the really expensive stuff as well.
I've lost the gym.
What?
I've lost it, love.
No!
But that's your gym, Rob.
It's the bank's gym now.
You're unemployed?
YYeah, love.
I'm bankrupt.
But don't worry.
I've got an inside tip that they're going to be recruiting at Virgin Active.
But what about money?
I mean, we need money.
I was going to give Emily money.
- I don't want it.
- What money?
She was going to bribe me not to go travelling with Naomi.
It is not a bribe.
It's just money I promised my daughter.
Yeah?
Well, where's my money?
No-one's getting any money.
- I'm giving Emily money.
- I don't want it.
Don't you get it?
I want Naomi.
I want to fuck Naomi.
What?
I do.
Get over it.
Rob!
Did you just hear what he said?
She is attractive, love.
Fuck, Rob!
He said "fuck"!
Now do you see what she's done to our family?
- I'm moving out.
- Don't be rash, love.
Britney, stop saying "fuck".
Emsy, sit down.
No.
I don't want to live here any more.
Fine.
Get out.
Go on.
Get out!
You're not welcome in this home any more!
You or Naomi!
That's my top.
You know Mum doesn't mean to be a total bitch.
Yes, she does.
And you let her.
She's trying to help you.
It's all fake.
This whole family's fake.
I'm not fake.
Fake tan?
Fake boyfriend.
Fake concern.
I am concerned!
Bitch!
And for your information, I was in the sun for five hours today.
And as for my boyfriend, he may be little, but for your further information, he's sweet, trustworthy and totally hung, ok?
Who said I was little?
Can you get the fuck out, babes?
He's definitely a keeper.
God, you're a selfish cow.
- Oh, fuck off, Kate.
- Please don't go.
I'll back you up.
You want to pick a better fake name next time.
There's no Nancys at Roundview.
And only one red-haired girl with a moped.
- You've been checking up on me?
- You lied.
I think it's pretty clear.
She killed herself.
Was it you?
Was it you, she killed herself?
No.
And it wasn't Naomi, ok?
She didn't know either of us.
She lied about that.
- She wouldn't lie to me.
- She lied to everyone!
I'm sorry you feel angry at her but it's really not my fucking problem.
I need the truth.
This isn't all of it.
No.
Emily, what are you scared of?
We can help each other.
Is it so out of the question that I might know what's best?
I'm not talking to you.
Emily.
I don't want you to move out.
I don't care.
I'm just trying to help you!
Fuck off!
"What is it, Sophia?
What did you lock up?"
Yes.
Fucking...
Oh, no.
It's ok.
It's just Emily.
Bonsoir.
Who was that?
Oh, just my mum.
What's all this?
I'm moving in.
Where?
Here.
Uh... isn't that the sort of thing people usually discuss?
I need to, ok?
OK.
- Ok?
- Ok!
Although, in many ways, it's sort of a violation.
But fuck it.
It's ok.
Really?
Really!
It'll be great.
You can be my pyjamas.
You need to do something about your moustache.
What?
Shit!
Shit!
Shit!
Shit!
This is just kind of terrible.
Yeah.
Fuck it!
If it's rubbish, we'll just go back to ours.
Where?
Ours.
Naomi!
Stay alive!
I will find you.
Hi.
How you doing?
This is the worst party I've ever been to.
The worst.
Really?
Panda's giving Thommo a dose of the old look-at-me routine.
You know how it is... letting your exes know that you're out there, that other people find you attractive...
That everything you thought you had together... they can do without it.
That they don't need you.
That guy over there keeps staring at you.
I merely observed.
Let it go.
Let it go before you screw everything up.
Cook, excuse me?
I don't want to see your muff.
Emilio looks jealous.
It's probably still not too late to be overcome by desire with me.
I could turn you, deffo.
Fuck off.
No, I'm serious.
It's probably been a while, innit, since you've seen one of these.
Look, mine is totally oustanding, man.
What's up, Emilio, man?
Why are you hiding in the pisser?
Do you ever get jealous, Cook?
If your shag's a shag, then you're always going to get your heart ripped out somewhere, aren't you?
What do you do about it?
You just burn, kid.
You just burn.
You just keep it on the inside.
Is that possible?
Yeah.
Cos you look a bit stupid if you don't, don't you?
Look at me, love.
Happy.
Effy.
You don't tell any of my secrets and I won't tell any of yours.
Or we could just go out there in a blaze of glory.
Dance, muff monkey?
- You got it.
- Come on, then, kid.
Oh, sorry.
- Cook!
- Get off me now.
Get off!
Who fucking wants one now?
"I need to see you.
No, now.
I've got something I need to show you.
Tonight."
Why did you?
Why here?
I dunno.
This is where it ends.
I've got something to show you.
I think she wanted you to have this.
I got it from her cadet locker.
I need to know what's in there.
Me too.
It's her work... her diary, you know?
Can't we just leave it?
I don't think we can, Naoms.
She's dead.
Let it go.
I can't.
See you round.
Can't we just go home?
Matt, come back!
Emily, please!
Emily!
Wait!
Please!
Can't we just go home?
I don't think so.
I made this for her.
Woodwork, you know?
Yeah.
"I can't stop crying.
I've tried to stop thinking, but it doesn't work.
You don't expect stuff to happen.
You can't control it.
You can't control anything.
So I'm at this stupid open day and everyone's snotty and rude, and then I see someone.
I'd never even spoken to her at Roundview.
It didn't seem to matter because then everything got really fun.
And by the time we were on our way home, we were telling secrets.
I wanted to move my hand.
I wanted to move it so much.
And then she moved hers.
I wish I'd told Naomi how easy it is for me to love someone.
We're all lonely and all we want is for someone to... you know, pay attention and tell us we're beautiful and cute and say that they want to..."
I don't believe it.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry!
You've ruined it.
You don't want anyone to care.
I could be dead in a second.
Everything's... so... fragile.
Didn't you realise that?
We were special.
- I was scared!
- You're always scared.
Emily!
Emily!
Naomi cheated.
And...
I don't know why she did that.
Oh, love.
Sweet girl.
I hate her.
- I know you do.
- I hate her!
I know, love.
It's ok.
Listen, I want to tell you something.
Listen to me.
You know, I cheated on your mum once.
What?
I was young.
I was too young.
I was 19.
I'd been married for two years.
Her family always saying what's what.
Scottish people.
God knows I regretted it.
Your Aunty Julie's no better-looking now than what she was then.
Her sister!
People do stupid things when they're trying to act like they're not trapped.
Was it ever the same again?
It was worse.
And then it was ok.
Then it got better.
And then we got you.
We got all the things we love.
Did she hate herself for taking you back?
What?
Hate herself?
What for?
She didn't do anything wrong.
She hated me, though.
For a very, very, very long time.
She's tough, your mum, you know.
You want to be glad of that.
I'm not like her, Dad.
That's ok, too.
Now I get it.
I've been saying for months, that these anti-government extremist groups are a huge problem.
Yeah.
Erikson's been a bomb waiting to go off, even before arroyo.
Atf.
They're worried about Kyle Erikson.
Maybe that's got something to do with the fact that he shot one of their agents and got away with it.
What's up?
Oh.
You, uh...
Left this on the nightstand last night.
Thank you.
I don't think that's necessary, Lisa.
All of our intel says that he's here in L.A.
And we've got an undercover in right now with an accomplice of erikson's named Kenneth Cobb.
You're the first to know.
"Joint task force evaluation"?
Some of us actually do paperwork.
Didn't know you were spying on us.
It's that time of year, Carter.
It happens to all of us.
I get evaluated by my boss.
And I get evaluated by mine...
You.
You really care what it says about you in a report?
No.
And less than no.
You?
You mean, do I ever want to make more than $60,000 a year and stop living out of a suitcase?
Yes.
You make that much?
Agent rice.
What?
!
We're on the way.
Apparently, there's a couple of sheriffs outside the house where Dean is.
Can you pull the sheriffs off?
Already at the door.
Sheriff's department!
Open the door!
Whoo!
Brother, it is on!
Think about this, kenny, okay?
Hold on.
They got no right to be here, man.
This is private property!
You stole a car, and it's parked in your driveway.
It's not an invitation, but come on, kenny.
No, man.
This is just pretense.
This is how they do it.
Little by little, they're taking our country away from us.
Open up!
Open the door!
Now!
Will you...
Will you turn the music down and talk to me, kenny, please?
Or at least take it off repeat.
What are you...
What are you doing, kenny?
Come on.
Exercising my rights as a sovereign citizen.
She's been itching for this.
A little something for you, too, baby.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Cobb, look.
I did not hook up with you to kill cops, okay?
The only reason I'm here is 'cause you said you were in with Kyle Erikson.
Screw Erikson!
We're on the front lines now, dawg!
So what, kenny, we're not joining up with them, huh?
Is that what you're telling me?
Why the hell do you keep asking me about Erikson?
W-why, man?
Why?
'Cause he's a legend.
Come on, man.
You heard about arroyo.
Atf busts his compound.
One of them gets hit.
Sheriff's department!
Open the door!
Big deal!
Erikson probably didn't even pull the trigger!
So, you lied.
You don't even work with Erikson.
Don't sweat it, bro.
We're about to be way bigger than Erikson.
Or do I have to do you before these pigs?
No.
Let's do it.
Let's do it!
Here we go.
On three.
Ready?
Yeah!
One...
Two...
Oh, uh, kenny, one thing.
I'm a cop.
Where's ty?
Getting his beauty sleep.
Careful, Dean.
Alex might put that in her evaluation report.
It's just a routine report.
Okay.
Well, don't forget our excessive use of force and a liberal interpretation of the Miranda rights.
Got anything new from Cobb?
No.
We put him under the lamp, but he gave us nothing new.
I thought he was part of Kyle Erikson's extremist group.
Liberty sons?
No.
They had a falling-out.
And according to Cobb,
Erikson thinks of himself as a kind of messiah.
Wants to be a rock star.
Seen his fan-page websites?
Guy's got groupies.
He's a good-looking guy.
Bad guys can be good-looking.
Did Cobb give up anyone else who might be in contact with Erikson?
I mean, someone's helping him hide out.
The only thing Cobb hates worse than Erikson is police.
Even if he knew something, he wouldn't tell us.
So we're nowhere.
I got someone.
Neal Erikson...
Kyle's younger brother.
The two seem close...
First bouncing around foster homes, then partners in crime.
We talked about this guy before.
He's in jail.
15 years, armed robbery.
Atf already questioned him in prison.
There's no way he's gonna flip on his brother.
We don't flip him.
We use him to lead us to his brother.
And how the hell are we gonna do that?
We break him out of jail.
Really?
Good morning.
Yeah.
Tough night?
You missed the meeting.
I did?
Mm-hmm.
I was working late.
On the Erikson case?
Uh...
No, actually.
Alex had me working surveil on someone out in compton, a fed thing.
Wow, man.
This lasagna and veggies is a hell of a science experiment.
Guess you've been burning at both ends since you and Melissa split, huh?
No, not really.
What did I miss?
Carter has a plan to catch Erikson, but it needs a lot of prep.
Let me jump in the shower.
Would it kill you to use a glass?
Neal Erikson...
Transfer to L.A. correctional.
Copy that.
Watch your step.
Got another transfer.
Actually, I only got an order for two, sir.
He was supposed to go this morning, but his tummy hurt.
It's an intestinal disorder...
Possibly an ulcer, which, by the way, if ignored, is an actionable offense.
He's all yours.
You're Kyle Erikson's brother, aren't you?
What's it to you, man?
Nothing.
Just hear the dudes in the yard talking about him like he's some kind of hero, so...
Your brother's that militia guy?
I saw him on "america's most wanted assholes," right?
I can't get you an autograph, if that's where this is headed.
Ray Blake.
Pine.
Carter pine.
Prison doc says I need surgery.
Like I'd let those hacks cut me open.
The only prison docs worth any damn good are at San Quentin.
That's where I'm headed.
That right?
First thing you got to check out in the joint...
Medical facilities, honestly.
You talk a lot, Ray.
Yeah, it's a nervous tic.
No big deal.
They should be close.
Oh.
So, what's this evaluation report all about?
Are we being judged?
No.
Yes.
But don't worry...
I think you do a great job, and I know it's not easy.
Thanks, sister.
I'm serious.
Keep it up, you're gonna have an amazing career.
Ty and Carter coming your way, Dean.
Don't move.
Don't move.
Give me the gun now.
I know you got it on you.
Give me the gun.
Let's go!
All right, keys...
Let's go.
Let's go!
Get out... now!
Let's go!
Get out.
Shut the door.
Shut it!
How you doing, brother?
That's your brother?
You were right about that guard.
500 bucks and a lap dance from Irene, and he sang about this transfer.
Nice work.
Here you go.
All right, what about these two?
Kill them?
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Are you sure that's what you want to do?
'Cause there's other options.
I think what the human chihuahua is trying to say is that adding two homicides to what is otherwise a clean getaway is stupid.
Ground rules...
You do anything I don't like, I shoot you in the face.
Anyone got a problem with that?
You waiting for a show of hands?
Come on!
Let's go!
Go, go!
Let's go!
Go!
This your place?
Nah, my old lady's.
You get the hell out of here!
Baby!
Don't you "baby" me.
I didn't think you two were dumb enough to break out of jail.
What, no hello kiss?
Shut up.
You bring two felons here with you?
Are you crazy?
What are you thinking?
They're never happy to see you when you first get out of the joint.
We just need a place to lie low till the heat dies.
That's all.
Come on, baby.
You know I can't live without you.
Hmm?
Come on.
Come to daddy.
Want me to do that thing I do to you?
Two days.
After that, I'll call the cops on you myself.
This reunion is touching, but, uh, I'm out, fellas.
Thanks for the ride.
Nobody's going anywhere.
Hey, listen.
You tell your lady what to do, okay?
Not me.
You got someplace better to go?
Yeah.
A beach in Mexico.
And how you gonna get there?
Oh, I'm a resourceful guy.
Yeah.
Well, let me put it to you this way.
You get caught, you could throw the cops to us.
And I can't have that.
I don't know what to tell you.
You point that thing at me again,
I'm gonna shove it so far up your ass.
Don't be stupid.
You want to stay free, we need money.
Yeah, and clothes.
Clothes, we can get.
And money?
Bro, you still got that stash?
Yeah.
I'll get it.
Good.
Come on, it's not like that.
Okay.
All right.
Okay.
Yeah.
I'll call you later.
Bye.
Met a girl.
Yeah, I guess you could say that.
Where?
Funny thing is I met her on the surveil in compton.
Dating a mark?
No.
But she helped sell the cover.
Carter's got them all at his house.
Now, how in the hell did Ray Blake end up in the van?
No choice, Alex.
They threw the dude in.
We'll deal with him later.
Why don't we let neal go?
Trail him while he looks up his brother?
And what if he decides to rip off a liquor store or shoot a nun?
Good point.
Look, I promised that we'd be in complete control of neal while we had him out.
Okay.
So how do we motivate him to find his brother, huh?
What do these extremists like more than anything?
You think they could have found me something more conspicuous?
Honestly, the damn thing's bright enough to read by.
Shut up, Ray.
These are all clean, untraceable.
Think your brother might be in the market?
Why are you so interested in my brother?
Because we need money, and your brother sounds like someone who likes guns.
I haven't spoken to my brother in three years.
That's called "going to prison."
And even if I did know where he is, why would I put him in business with a bunch of fugitives like you?
Well, wouldn't he want to help out his little brother?
Hey.
I don't need my brother fixing my problems, okay?
I might know somebody.
Yeah.
Good friend of mine.
He's always looking for guns.
See?
Solves the whole problem.
Yeah, what's his name?
Big Tommy.
"Big Tommy"?
Okay.
What's big Tommy's last name?
W-what does it matter?
You want us to do a deal with your good friend, whose last name you don't even know?
Yeah.
Shut up, Ray.
Just shut up.
Geez.
Yeah, shut up, Ray.
Neal didn't go for the guns.
What's the problem?
There might be a little less brotherly love there than I thought.
Can I help you, Ray?
Yeah, my stomach is killing me.
Did you get any of that pink crap?
No!
Geez.
What kind of house is this, anyway?
How long have you lived here?
There's no medicine, no pictures... it's weird.
We'll get you something for your stomach.
But first...
Big Tommy.
You really trust him?
Yeah.
We've done a lot of business.
Give him a call.
All right.
I'll get bt's ass on the phone right now.
What are you doing?
Stopping Ray's intestinal issues from derailing the whole investigation.
By making a deal with his friend?
I think I have a way of getting rid of Ray and forcing neal to find his brother.
If he thinks we're really on the run...
It's gonna be hard to keep the whole ruse going out in the real world.
It might be harder stuck in this room.
I promised the brass we'd be in complete control of this situation at all times.
See?
That's why I never make promises.
Big Tommy is all systems go.
This guy gonna show or what?
Big Tommy's nothing if not reliable.
Top dollar, Ray.
No friend discounts, no side deals.
There he is.
Hey, hey.
Relax.
We're not in the prison yard anymore.
We're business partners now, huh?
Right.
Yeah.
And if you come back with a dollar less than we talked about,
I'm gonna have my brother, Dean, run you over in the parking lot.
You seeing the blonde?
The one with the glock?
Let's go.
L.A.P.D.!
Put your hands where I can see them!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Put your hands where I can see them!
Ow!
No!
Psst!
Psst!
Get out of here.
You're gonna want to get out of here.
That's sweet of you, Ray.
Oh.
Oh, my stomach hurts.
Take it easy.
Come on, take it easy!
We set up one deal, and the cops bust us?
Screw easy!
They were after big Tommy.
It wasn't even about us.
Ray strike you as the strong, silent type?
H-he's probably trading up everything he knows about us right now to save his own ass.
Your girlfriend's gonna be pissed, huh?
You think?
All right.
So, look.
We I... we lay low until we come up with a plan.
Plans take money.
Which, thanks to Ray, we're still short on.
Look, boys.
I think it's time we ended our brief, but deeply meaningful, partnership.
Good luck, huh?
What?
Suddenly you got some place to go?
!
Hey, get your hands off of me!
Back off!
Hey, get your hands off of me!
Stop it, both of you!
Come on, man!
From what I hear, your brother's pretty good at hiding out.
Now, you call him and tell him we need a place to stay.
Why would I do that?
Because we saved your ass...
Twice, and you owe us.
And you know as well as I do your brother's our best chance at staying free.
He's not gonna be easy to find, man.
Then we better get started.
It's goosedown, water resistant.
Real soft...
Go ahead, give it a feel.
You ever been, uh, beach camping?
It's pretty romantic.
Hold on one second.
What's up, neal?
Thought you were in the clink.
Yeah, well, good behavior, man.
Uh-huh.
We need to talk.
In private.
All right.
What do you say we give that thing a test-drive?
Phew!
If you broke out, leave now.
I do not need that kind of heat, man, seriously.
We're looking for Kyle.
Has he come to see you lately?
Yeah, I've...
I've seen him.
And if I see him again, he's dead.
Kyle came in here looking for some guns.
Told him, "sure.
Why not?
Just like old times, right?"
Except this time, your douchebag brother decided not to pay me.
He jacked you?
Yeah.
Told me to consider it a donation for the movement.
I fronted for the guns, man.
He put me in a real bad financial situation, 'cause, see, contrary to appearances,
Glenn's big outdoors...
Not doing so great.
Do you know where he is?
No.
And I don't want to know.
Well, if we can find him, we can get your money.
You don't get it, do you?
I don't want my money.
He's changed, neal.
Okay?
I don't want anything to do with that crazy son of a bitch.
And now that I know what he's planning...
Neither should you.
I think you guys should leave.
I got your call.
Dean's coming in.
He says they have something on Kyle Erikson.
Did you have ty doing some sort of surveillance in compton?
I did...
A few weeks ago.
Turned out to be a dead end.
What?
Nothing.
Mmm.
Hey, did you run a bg on our man?
Yeah.
Glenn fischer.
He's been picked up a couple of times for buying and selling illegal guns.
Okay, well, Glenn fischer said that Erikson came in recently to buy hardware off him.
Did he say for what?
No, we didn't get that far.
But he did say it was for something big.
Got to give Erikson props...
Shoots an atf Agent and still won't lay low?
Guy's a player.
Haul his ass in.
See if he really knows anything.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wait a minute, now.
I don't know.
Even though Glenn hates Erikson, he's still got that "don't tread on me" attitude.
He may not talk, even if we ask politely.
We still got the same guns as before, so if Glenn's still dealing, we just sell him a couple, pop him.
All right.
Take a run at Glenn with jaimie.
Hey, Dean.
How close is neal to finding his brother?
Still working on it.
Can Carter really keep this contained?
100%.
Ty, where the hell are you?
You're gonna be late for your own sting.
Hello.
Welcome to Glenn's big outdoors.
What can I do you for?
Ah...
I need help.
Well, I'm always happy to help a damsel in distress.
Oh.
I need a gun.
What kind of gun?
I don't know.
I was mugged a few months ago.
The guy had a knife, so it shook me up pretty bad.
Yeah, I bet it did.
Were you hurt?
No, but he got my money.
The truth is, I don't like guns, but the police were so freakin' useless.
I know what you mean.
I think I got exactly what you need.
Right here.
Simple.
Reliable.
Yeah.
Whoa.
Wow.
It's heavy.
You've never shot before.
I could show you how.
That'd be great.
Really?
I-I mean...
Cool.
There's one problem.
When I was younger, I got a couple petty thefts, and they were bumped up into felonies.
Is there any way around that?
Anything for you, doll.
This is a gun here that doesn't necessarily need to be registered.
Well, how much?
Uh...
Make me an offer.
Okay.
Cash only.
Aw, you got to be kidding me.
So, Alex is grilling Glenn.
It turns out he has three weapons charges, so if he knows anything, he's gonna talk.
You didn't have to pull an audible.
I had no choice.
You were late.
I was three minutes late.
A lot can happen in three minutes.
Okay.
I'm sorry, jaimie.
You working surveillance again last night?
Why do you say it like that?
'Cause I talked to Alex.
The surveillance she asked you to do was over two weeks ago.
You checking up on me now?
Don't deflect.
What's up with the girl?
She's having fun, jaimie.
I'm having fun.
No foul, no harm, right?
What you do on your own personal time is your business.
Just don't let it screw up my job.
Good time for a drink?
It's always a good time for a drink in this place, man.
Is that neal?
Frankie.
I'm assuming this visit isn't sanctioned by the California department of corrections.
Nope.
This is, uh...
We don't need to use names.
This is a friend of mine.
Friends drink free here.
What kind of bar you running here, Frankie?
It's more like a social club.
Listen, you seen Kyle around?
Has he come by for a drink, maybe some relief?
Baby, it's been a long time since your brother's had to pay for it.
He did call, though, looking for some money.
You got a phone number?
Might not even be good anymore.
You know how cautious he is.
Let's go.
What's the rush?
You boys are welcome to stay.
Everything free for friends?
Just drinks.
Ah.
We're a little light on cash right now.
Next time.
Hey.
I'm glad you and your brother worked past all that crap.
I didn't really have a choice, did I?
We should gogo back to the hot, call your brother.
This is all I got left.
Pump number three.
Excuse me.
Can I help you, officers?
We saw you across the street.
You know you have a broken taillight?
Uh, I'll get that fixed right away.
Sorry about that.
Can I see your license and registration?
Listen, I'm a cop.
Lieutenant Carter Shaw.
L.A.P.D.
I'm in the middle of an undercover case.
I need you to get back in your patrol unit and drive away.
You got to do better than that, buddy.
Call it in now...
L.A.P.D. Or FBI.
Ask for Agent Alex rice.
So now you're a fed.
Where's your junior g-man badge, then?
Listen, don't ruin your careers over this, guys.
All right, secret Agent man, step back.
Get down on the ground, man.
Get his gun.
Let's go.
How you like me now, bitch?
I said, "let's go."
What are you gonna do, man?
You gonna shoot me over this pig?
Kill you or go down for killing a cop?
Easy choice.
Yeah.
Nice!
Hey.
What's up?
Just checking in.
See if you were planning on shooting any old ladies or puppies after jacking those two cops.
Yeah.
Well, you see, the thing about that was...
Do you have any idea how big of a deal that was?
I had it under control, Alex.
You let a convicted felon put a gun on an officer.
We got a phone number for Kyle Erikson.
Neal andean are upstairs right now waiting for a callback.
We're close to getting Erikson.
Come on.
I got this.
I should pull you for being such a pain in the ass.
Why don't you put that in my evaluation report?
It's been a whole day.
Your brother gonna call or what?
If it's his number, he'll call.
That bartender said something about you getting over something with Kyle.
What'd she mean?
Man, w-what did you do, watch some kind of self-help tv while I was taking a leak?
I just want to know if you can deliver on this.
If you can't, then no offense, but you can go to hell.
I was doing time in chino for something Kyle did.
You took the rap for him?
Yeah.
Him and one of his dumb militia men, Reese, knocked over a jewelry store in Portland.
The feds caught up with Reese, and he told them it was me he hit that store with, not Kyle.
He told him to say that?
Why the hell would you go along with something like that?
'Cause he'd do the same for me.
You sure about that?
Hello?
Yeah.
It's been a long time, Kyle.
Long time.
Good news...
Kyle Erikson called back.
He agreed to hide us.
Where is he?
I didn't speak to him directly.
Neal arranged it.
We're supposed to meet him downtown at midnight.
Good.
That's when we'll take him.
Jaimie and ty find out what Erikson's big plan is from Glenn?
All Glenn said is that Erikson was planning on assassinating someone.
We had to cut him loose after that.
He give you a name?
No, but he did say it was gonna be a political statement.
We're checking to see if there's anyone that Erikson has a grudge with.
A political statement doesn't have to be personal.
Just has to be big.
He'll be looking to hit someone who will get him some press.
We'll bust Erikson tonight and find out who he's targeting.
Or...
We don't take him tonight.
I could stay under and find out who he's targeting from the inside.
No.
What do you mean, "no"?
Why the hell not?
This is coming from my boss.
I told him we didn't have an exact I.D. On Erikson's target.
He said if we have a chance to take Erikson, we take him.
Deal with the assassination later.
Busting him doesn't mean we'll stop the hit.
I mean, Erikson may be a megalomaniac, but he's not dumb.
He'll probably send one of his little disciples to do it.
That's your opinion.
I'm just doing what's best for this case.
Good.
The case is Kyle Erikson.
We're taking him tonight.
There they are.
What are we looking for?
I don't know.
He just said meet him here, midnight.
Wait.
That's him.
Did you see them?
See who?
Back there.
The truck.
I didn't see anything.
They're there.
Trust me.
Okay.
What do you want to do?
Looks like they're loading into Erikson's van.
Get ready.
Get out of the van.
What the hell are you doing?
Is there some kind of asshole pill they give you guys at the academy?
I gave you and Carter exact orders.
He snuck a cellphone in.
He'll call as soon as he figures out who Erikson's targeting, okay?
What if Erikson finds the cellphone on him?
What if they decide they just don't want Carter around anymore and shoot him?
!
He'll call.
Get with ty and jaimie and check out the van.
See if there's anything you can get off it about where they might have taken Carter.
Okay.
You know, he's just doing what's best for the case.
I'm getting tired of hearing that.
Slick move with your brother...
Sending him out as a decoy.
Any idea how they were on to you?
I was about to ask you the same thing.
That's len...
Man of few words.
He's a good soldier.
No idea why the cops were there?
All I know is that I busted neal out, and I kept his ass safe, and then I gave up my brother so you could get away.
That's what I know.
Len Get our guest some coffee.
Huh?
Neal's always stepping in it.
Even when we were kids, needed someone to show him the way.
If I hadn't hired a girl to bust his cherry,
I think he'd still be a virgin.
Ah.
That's, uh, Wendy.
That's grace.
Come on, girls.
Show Mr. pine some hospitality.
If I knew this is what you militia guys did,
I would have joined up years ago.
Mm-hmm.
We have restrictions, of course.
Of course.
I think my brother would like some company.
Mmm.
Enjoy yourself.
Did you miss me?
Mm-hmm.
Hmm?
Anything off the van?
No.
Looks like Erikson stole it out of tarzana yesterday.
Ty and Dean are trying to run it down, but...
Carter?
Sorry.
Tell him I'll call him back.
You're really worried.
Erikson's a big case.
I mean about Carter.
Yeah, well, aren't you?
Mm-hmm.
Take it easy on the bear.
I know we planned this for later, but what with my brother showing up, people might be looking for him.
Don't know how much longer we'll be safe here.
It's our chance to make history.
One bullet in washburn...
Will change everything.
Be another shot heard 'round the world.
They'll write poems about it.
I know I can count on you.
Rice.
It Carter.
Where are you?
Erikson's looking to kill someone named washburn.
Federal courthouse.
Look for, uh, prosecutors, judges... something like that.
Okay, uh, there's a federal judge named washburn.
Looks like he ruled a big case against some of these militia types last year.
That's got to be it.
Find him.
This is officer jaimie Allen with the l.A.P.D.
I need to speak with judge washburn.
Where are you?
Erikson's not making the hit himself.
He sent someone else...
A kid, maybe 24, thin, black hair, crew cut.
We'll get to washburn, Carter.
Alex, he already sent him.
You have to move now.
No one can get him on his cell.
He's due in court right now.
We have to get to him first.
Carter, where the hell are you?
Put down the damn phone.
Carter's cover's blown.
Let's get to the judge.
What about Carter?
There's no time.
Call ty and Dean.
What the hell are you doing?
I'm a cop, neal.
Damn.
I did not see that coming.
Put the gun down.
Why?
Why would I do that?
Because your brother is about to execute a federal judge, and no matter what happens, you'll be an accomplice.
You already took the fall for him once, neal.
Don't do it again.
So, what?
You gonna help me...
Is that it?
... if I cooperate?
Please.
Kyle!
Get in here!
What the hell is this?
He's a cop.
Drop your gun, Kyle.
Kyle, don't.
I can't believe he shot me.
There he is.
Judge.
L.A.P.D. Judge washburn.
Hey!
I'm special Agent Alex rice, FBI.
L.A.P.D.
Put your guns down!
L.A.P.D. FBI.
There's been a threat made on your life.
Put your guns down!
Gun!
Drop it.
Drop it!
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah.
Ah-ah.
Ah.
I surrender.
You killed your brother just to try to get away?
What are little brothers for?
You're sick.
Aah!
Hey.
Yeah, I'm fine.
Yeah.
Good.
Good.
All right, I'll see you later.
I will be a national hero for what I did today, even in jail.
Don't start writing your memoirs just yet.
They stopped crew cut and your girlfriend before they could get to judge washburn.
You're a joke.
Gah!
That was some old-school undercover, lieutenant.
Great job.
I wish I was under with laker girls, but we worked it out.
Where you going?
Good job today.
I didn't even see her coming.
Well, you got the primary suspect.
I just got lucky.
Nah.
You're good.
I wasn't judging your night life.
I just want to do a good job.
You probably think I'm an asshole that I split up with Mel, huh?
No.
I get it.
Really?
Our jobs are great.
Just not a lot of room for other people.
Maybe in the long run, you did her a favor, huh?
Good night.
Mmm.
He good?
Mm-hmm.
Hungry?
No, I ate.
Sex?
Nice try.
How about a beer?
Sure.
So Your bosses must be happy.
Got Kyle Erikson, saved a life.
They're happy about the bust.
But when the bureau gives you an order, you're expected to follow it, so I guess I won't be getting a gold star on my evaluation.
You know I really don't care what you write about m.
I think you care that we're sleeping together, we work together, and I get to tell people what I really think about you.
Well, when you put it like that.
All right.
Let's make it even.
Give me an honest evaluation.
Really?
Special Agent Alex rice exhibits sharp tactical skills, good leadership qualities...
I like it so far.
...But lacks creativity and can be inflexible.
"Inflexible."
Just being honest.
So am I.
Okay.
Finally.
"Though lieutenant Shaw's unorthodox methods
"often yield results,
"he's chronically belligerent,
"disdainful of authority, independently minded to the point of narcissistic."
"Belligerent," "disdainful," "narcissistic"?
Just add "opinionated" and "charmless,"
and I think you nailed it.
It's a joke, Carter.
I can't show you the real report.
You look like you could use a steak and a couple Martinis, on me.
If it's on you.
You know, um, "belligerent," "narcissistic"
just seem just a little strong.
Yeah.
Just wait till you try and get me in bed tonight.
I'll show you inflexible.
Come on, I was joking too.
Now I get it.
No, I get it.
I've been saying for months,
I've been saying for months, that these anti-government extremist groups that these anti-government extremist groups are a huge problem.
are a huge problem.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Erikson's been a bomb waiting to go off, even before arroyo.
Erikson's been a bomb waiting to go off, even before arroyo.
A.T.F. They're worried about Kyle Erikson.
Atf.
They're worried about Kyle Erikson.
Maybe that's got something to do with the fact that he shot one of their agents
Maybe that's got something to do with the fact and got away with it.
that he shot one of their agents and got away with it.
What's up?
What's up?
Oh.
You, uh...
Oh.
You, uh...
Left this on the nightstand last night.
Thank you.
Left this on the nightstand last night.
I don't think that's necessary, Lisa.
Thank you.
All of our intel says that he's here in L.A.
I don't think that's necessary, Lisa.
And we've got an undercover in right now with an accomplice of erikson's
All of our intel says that he's here in L.A.
named Kenneth Cobb.
And we've got an undercover in right now
You're the first to know.
with an accomplice of erikson's named Kenneth Cobb.
"Joint task force evaluation"?
You're the first to know.
Some of us actually do paperwork.
"Joint task force evaluation"?
Didn't know you were spying on us.
Some of us actually do paperwork.
It's that time of year, Carter.
It happens to all of us.
Didn't know you were spying on us.
I get evaluated by my boss.
It's that time of year, Carter.
It happens to all of us.
And I get evaluated by mine...
I get evaluated by my boss.
You.
And I get evaluated by mine...
You really care what it says about you in a report?
You.
No.

And less than no.
No.
And less than no.
You?

You mean, do I ever want to make more than $60,000 a year
You mean, do I ever want to make more than $60,000 a year and stop living out of a suitcase?
and stop living out of a suitcase?
Yes.
Yes.
You make that much?
You make that much?
Agent Rice.
Agent rice.

We're on the way.
Apparently, there's a couple of sheriffs outside the house where Dean is.
Apparently, there's a couple of sheriffs
Can you pull the sheriffs off?

Already at the door.

Or at least take it off repeat.
She's been itching for this.
What are you...
What are you doing, kenny?
A little something for you, too, baby.
Come on.
Exercising my rights as a sovereign citizen.
No, no...
She's been itching for this.
No, no, no.
Cobb, look.
A little something for you, too, baby.
I did not hook up with you to kill cops, okay?
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Cobb, look.
The only reason I'm here is 'cause you said you were in with Kyle Erikson.
I did not hook up with you to kill cops, okay?
Screw Erikson!
The only reason I'm here
We're on the front lines now, dawg!
is 'cause you said you were in with Kyle Erikson.
So what, kenny, we're not joining up with them, huh?
Screw Erikson!
Why the hell do you keep asking me about Erikson?
We're on the front lines now, dawg!
W-why, man?
Why?
So what, kenny, we're not joining up with them, huh?
'Cause he's a legend.
Is that what you're telling me?
Come on, man.
You heard about arroyo.
Why the hell do you keep asking me about Erikson?
A.T.F. busts his compound.
One of them gets hit.
W-why, man?
Why?
'Cause he's a legend.
Open the door!
Come on, man.
You heard about arroyo.
Big deal!
Erikson probably didn't even pull the trigger!
Atf busts his compound.
One of them gets hit.
So, you lied.
Sheriff's department!
Open the door!
You don't even work with Erikson.
Big deal!
Erikson probably didn't even pull the trigger!
Don't sweat it, bro.
So, you lied.
We're about to be way bigger than Erikson.
You don't even work with Erikson.
Or do I have to do you before these pigs?
Don't sweat it, bro.
No.
Let's do it.
We're about to be way bigger than Erikson.
Open the door!
Or do I have to do you before these pigs?
Let's do it!
No.
Let's do it.
Here we go.
On three.
Ready?
One...
Let's do it!
Two...
Oh, uh, kenny, one thing.
Here we go.
On three.
Ready?
Yeah!
I'm a cop.
One...
Two...
Where's Ty?
Oh, uh, kenny, one thing.
Getting his beauty sleep.
I'm a cop.
Careful, Dean.
Alex might put that in her evaluation report.
Where's ty?
It's just a routine report.
Getting his beauty sleep.
Okay.
Well, don't forget our excessive use of force
Careful, Dean.
and a liberal interpretation of the Miranda rights.
Alex might put that in her evaluation report.
Got anything new from Cobb?
It's just a routine report.
No.
We put him under the lamp, but he gave us nothing new.
Okay.
Well, don't forget our excessive use of force
I thought he was part of Kyle Erikson's extremist group.
and a liberal interpretation of the Miranda rights.
Liberty sons?
Got anything new from Cobb?
No.
They had a falling-out.
And according to Cobb,
No.
We put him under the lamp, but he gave us nothing new.
Erikson thinks of himself as a kind of messiah.
I thought he was part of Kyle Erikson's extremist group.
Wants to be a rock star.
Liberty sons?
No.
They had a falling-out.
Seen his fan-page websites?
And according to Cobb,
Guy's got groupies.
Erikson thinks of himself as a kind of messiah.
He's a good-looking guy.
Wants to be a rock star.
Bad guys can be good-looking.
Seen his fan-page websites?
Guy's got groupies.
Did Cobb give up anyone else who might be in contact with Erikson?
He's a good-looking guy.
I mean, someone's helping him hide out.
Bad guys can be good-looking.
The only thing Cobb hates worse than Erikson is police.
Did Cobb give up anyone else
Even if he knew something, he wouldn't tell us.
who might be in contact with Erikson?
So we're nowhere.
I mean, someone's helping him hide out.
I got someone.
The only thing Cobb hates worse than Erikson is police.
Neal Erikson.
Even if he knew something, he wouldn't tell us.
Kyle's younger brother.
The two seem close...
So we're nowhere.
I got someone.
First bouncing around foster homes, then partners in crime.
Neal Erikson...
We talked about this guy before.
He's in jail.
Kyle's younger brother.
15 years, armed robbery.
The two seem close...
A.T.F. already questioned him in prison.
First bouncing around foster homes,
There's no way he's gonna flip on his brother.
then partners in crime.
We don't flip him.
We talked about this guy before.
He's in jail.
We use him to lead us to his brother.
15 years, armed robbery.
And how the hell are we gonna do that?
Atf already questioned him in prison.
We break him out of jail.
There's no way he's gonna flip on his brother.
We don't flip him.
We use him to lead us to his brother.
Corrected by mczolly
And how the hell are we gonna do that?
- Really?
- Good morning.
We break him out of jail.
Yeah.
Tough night?
Really?
Good morning.
You missed the meeting.
Yeah.
Tough night?
I did?
You missed the meeting.
I was working late.
I did?
Mm-hmm.
On the Erikson case?
I was working late.
Uh...
No, actually.
On the Erikson case?
Alex had me working surveil on someone out in Compton,
Uh...
No, actually.
a fed thing.
Alex had me working surveil on someone out in compton,
Wow, man.
This lasagna and veggies is a hell of a science experiment.
a fed thing.
Guess you've been burning at both ends since you and Melissa split, huh?
Wow, man.
No, not really.
This lasagna and veggies is a hell of a science experiment.
What did I miss?
Guess you've been burning at both ends
Carter has a plan to catch Erikson, but it needs a lot of prep.
since you and Melissa split, huh?
Let me jump in the shower.
No, not really.
Would it kill you to use a glass?
What did I miss?
Neal Erikson...
Transfer to L.A. correctional.
Carter has a plan to catch Erikson,
Copy that.
but it needs a lot of prep.
Watch your step.
Let me jump in the shower.
Got another transfer.
Would it kill you to use a glass?
Actually, I only got an order for two, sir.
Neal Erikson...
Transfer to L.A. correctional.
He was supposed to go this morning, but his tummy hurt.
Copy that.
It's an intestinal disorder...
Possibly an ulcer,
Watch your step.
which, by the way, if ignored, is an actionable offense.
Got another transfer.
He's all yours.
Actually, I only got an order for two, sir.
You're Kyle Erikson's brother, aren't you?
He was supposed to go this morning, but his tummy hurt.
What's it to you, man?
It's an intestinal disorder...
Possibly an ulcer,
Nothing.
which, by the way, if ignored, is an actionable offense.
Just hear the dudes in the yard talking about him like he's some kind of hero, so...
He's all yours.
Your brother's that militia guy?
You're Kyle Erikson's brother, aren't you?
I saw him on "america's most wanted assholes," right?
What's it to you, man?
I can't get you an autograph, if that's where this is headed.
Nothing.
Ray Blake.
Just hear the dudes in the yard talking about him
Pine.
Carter Pine.
like he's some kind of hero, so...
Prison doc says I need surgery.
Your brother's that militia guy?
Like I'd let those hacks cut me open.
I saw him on "america's most wanted assholes," right?
The only prison docs worth any damn good are at San Quentin.
I can't get you an autograph, if that's where this is headed.
That's where I'm headed.
Ray Blake.
That right?
Pine.
Carter pine.
First thing you got to check out in the joint medical facilities, honestly.
Prison doc says I need surgery.
You talk a lot, Ray.
Like I'd let those hacks cut me open.
Yeah, it's a nervous tic.
No big deal.
The only prison docs worth any damn good are at San Quentin.
They should be close.
That's where I'm headed.
That right?
So, what's this evaluation report all about?
First thing you got to check out in the joint...
Are we being judged?
Medical facilities, honestly.
No.
You talk a lot, Ray.
Yes.
Yeah, it's a nervous tic.
No big deal.
But don't worry...
I think you do a great job, and I know it's not easy.
They should be close.
Thanks, sister.
Oh.
I'm serious.
So, what's this evaluation report all about?
Keep it up, you're gonna have an amazing career.
Are we being judged?
Ty and Carter coming your way, Dean.
No.
Don't move.
Yes.
Don't move.
But don't worry...
I think you do a great job,
Give me the gun now.
I know you got it on you.
and I know it's not easy.
Give me the gun.
Let's go!
Thanks, sister.
All right, keys...
Let's go.
I'm serious.
Let's go!
Keep it up, you're gonna have an amazing career.
Get out... now!
Let's go!
Ty and Carter coming your way, Dean.
Get out.
Don't move.
Shut the door.
Shut it!
Don't move.
How you doing, brother?
Give me the gun now.
I know you got it on you.
That's your brother?
Give me the gun.
Let's go!
You were right about that guard.
All right, keys...
Let's go.
500 bucks and a lap dance from Irene, and he sang about this transfer.
Let's go!
Nice work.
Get out... now!
Let's go!
Here you go.
Get out.
All right, what about these two?
Shut the door.
Shut it!
- Kill them?
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
How you doing, brother?
Are you sure that's what you want to do?
'Cause there's other options.
That's your brother?
I think what the human chihuahua is trying to say
You were right about that guard.
is that adding two homicides to what is otherwise a clean getaway is stupid.
500 bucks and a lap dance from Irene,
Ground rules... and he sang about this transfer.
You do anything I don't like, I shoot you in the face.
Nice work.
Here you go.
Anyone got a problem with that?
All right, what about these two?
You waiting for a show of hands?
Come on!
Let's go!
Kill them?
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Go, go!
Let's go!
Are you sure that's what you want to do?
'Cause there's other options.
Go!
I think what the human chihuahua is trying to say
This your place?
is that adding two homicides
Nah, my old lady's.
to what is otherwise a clean getaway is stupid.
You get the hell out of here!
Ground rules...
- Baby!
- Don't you "baby" me.
You do anything I don't like, I shoot you in the face.
I didn't think you two were dumb enough to break out of jail.
Anyone got a problem with that?
- What, no hello kiss?
- Shut up.
You waiting for a show of hands?
Come on!
Let's go!
You bring two felons here with you?
Go, go!
Let's go!
Are you crazy?
What are you thinking?
Go!
They're never happy to see you when you first get out of the joint.
This your place?
Nah, my old lady's.
We just need a place to lie low till the heat dies.
That's all.
You get the hell out of here!
Come on, baby.
Baby!
You know I can't live without you.
Don't you "baby" me.
Come on.
Come to daddy.
I didn't think you two were dumb enough to break out of jail.
Want me to do that thing I do to you?
What, no hello kiss?
Two days.
Shut up.
After that, I'll call the cops on you myself.
You bring two felons here with you?
This reunion is touching,
Are you crazy?
What are you thinking?
but, uh, I'm out, fellas.
They're never happy to see you when you first get out of the joint.
Thanks for the ride.
We just need a place to lie low till the heat dies.
That's all.
Nobody's going anywhere.
Come on, baby.
Hey, listen.
You tell your lady what to do, okay?
You know I can't live without you.
Not me.
Hmm?
- You got someplace better to go?
- Yeah.
Come on.
Come to daddy.
A beach in Mexico.
Want me to do that thing I do to you?
And how you gonna get there?
Two days.
Oh, I'm a resourceful guy.
After that, I'll call the cops on you myself.
Yeah.
Well, let me put it to you this way.
This reunion is touching,
You get caught, you could throw the cops to us.
but, uh, I'm out, fellas.
And I can't have that.
Thanks for the ride.
I don't know what to tell you.
Nobody's going anywhere.
You point that thing at me again,
Hey, listen.
You tell your lady what to do, okay?
I'm gonna shove it so far up your ass.
Not me.
Don't be stupid.
You got someplace better to go?
You want to stay free, we need money.
Yeah.
A beach in Mexico.
Yeah, and clothes.
And how you gonna get there?
Clothes, we can get.
Oh, I'm a resourceful guy.
And money?
Yeah.
Well, let me put it to you this way.
Bro, you still got that stash?
You get caught,
Yeah.
I'll get it.
you could throw the cops to us.
Good.
And I can't have that.
Come on, it's not like that.
I don't know what to tell you.
Okay.
All right.
You point that thing at me again,
Okay.
Yeah.
I'm gonna shove it so far up your ass.
I'll call you later.
Bye.
Don't be stupid.
Met a girl.
You want to stay free, we need money.
Yeah, I guess you could say that.
Yeah, and clothes.
Where?
Clothes, we can get.
Funny thing is I met her on the surveil in Compton.
And money?
Dating a mark?
Bro, you still got that stash?
No.
But she helped sell the cover.
Yeah.
I'll get it.
Good.
Carter's got them all at his house.
Come on, it's not like that.
Now, how in the hell did Ray Blake end up in the van?
Okay.
All right.
No choice, Alex.
They threw the dude in.
Okay.
Yeah.
We'll deal with him later.
I'll call you later.
Bye.
Why don't we let Neal go?
Met a girl.
Trail him while he looks up his brother?
Yeah, I guess you could say that.
And what if he decides to rip off a liquor store or shoot a nun?
Where?
Good point.
Funny thing is I met her on the surveil in compton.
Look, I promised that we'd be in complete control of Neal while we had him out.
Dating a mark?
Okay.
So how do we motivate him to find his brother, huh?
No.
But she helped sell the cover.
What do these extremists like more than anything?
Carter's got them all at his house.
You think they could have found me something more conspicuous?
Now, how in the hell did Ray Blake end up in the van?
Honestly, the damn thing's bright enough to read by.
No choice, Alex.
They threw the dude in.
Shut up, Ray.
We'll deal with him later.
These are all clean, untraceable.
Why don't we let neal go?
Think your brother might be in the market?
Trail him while he looks up his brother?
Why are you so interested in my brother?
And what if he decides to rip off a liquor store or shoot a nun?
Because we need money,
Good point.
and your brother sounds like someone who likes guns.
Look, I promised that we'd be in complete control of neal while we had him out.
I haven't spoken to my brother in three years.
Okay.
So how do we motivate him to find his brother, huh?
That's called "going to prison."
What do these extremists like more than anything?
And even if I did know where he is,
You think they could have found me something more conspicuous?
why would I put him in business with a bunch of fugitives like you?
Honestly, the damn thing's bright enough to read by.
Well, wouldn't he want to help out his little brother?
Shut up, Ray.
Hey.
These are all clean, untraceable.
I don't need my brother fixing my problems, okay?
Think your brother might be in the market?
I might know somebody.
Why are you so interested in my brother?
Yeah.
Good friend of mine.
Because we need money,
He's always looking for guns.
and your brother sounds like someone who likes guns.
See?
Solves the whole problem.
I haven't spoken to my brother in three years.
Yeah, what's his name?
That's called "going to prison."
Big Tommy.
And even if I did know where he is,
Big Tommy?
why would I put him in business
Okay.
What's Big Tommy's last name?
with a bunch of fugitives like you?
W-what does it matter?
Well, wouldn't he want to help out his little brother?
You want us to do a deal with your good friend, whose last name you don't even know?
Hey.
- Yeah.
- Shut up, Ray.
Just shut up.
I don't need my brother fixing my problems, okay?
- Geez.
- Yeah, shut up, Ray.
I might know somebody.
Neal didn't go for the guns.
Yeah.
Good friend of mine.
What's the problem?
He's always looking for guns.
There might be a little less brotherly love there than I thought.
See?
Solves the whole problem.
Can I help you, Ray?
Yeah, what's his name?
Yeah, my stomach is killing me.
Did you get any of that pink crap?
Big Tommy.
- No!
- Geez.
"Big Tommy"?
What kind of house is this, anyway?
How long have you lived here?
Okay.
What's big Tommy's last name?
There's no medicine, no pictures... it's weird.
W-what does it matter?
We'll get you something for your stomach.
But first...
You want us to do a deal with your good friend,
Big Tommy.
whose last name you don't even know?
You really trust him?
Yeah.
Shut up, Ray.
Just shut up.
Yeah.
We've done a lot of business.
Geez.
Yeah, shut up, Ray.
Give him a call.
Neal didn't go for the guns.
What's the problem?
All right.
There might be a little less brotherly love there than I thought.
I'll get BT's ass on the phone right now.
Can I help you, Ray?
What are you doing?
Yeah, my stomach is killing me.
Stopping Ray's intestinal issues from derailing the whole investigation.
Did you get any of that pink crap?
No!
By making a deal with his friend?
Geez.
What kind of house is this, anyway?
I think I have a way of getting rid of Ray
How long have you lived here?
and forcing Neal to find his brother.
There's no medicine, no pictures... it's weird.
If he thinks we're really on the run...
We'll get you something for your stomach.
It's gonna be hard to keep the whole ruse going out in the real world.
But first...
Big Tommy.
It might be harder stuck in this room.
You really trust him?
I promised the brass we'd be in complete control of this situation at all times.
Yeah.
We've done a lot of business.
See?
That's why I never make promises.
Give him a call.
Big Tommy...
All right.
I'll get bt's ass on the phone right now.
...is all systems go.
What are you doing?
This guy gonna show or what?
Stopping Ray's intestinal issues
Big Tommy's nothing if not reliable.
from derailing the whole investigation.
Top dollar, Ray.
By making a deal with his friend?
No friend discounts, no side deals.
I think I have a way of getting rid of Ray
There he is.
and forcing neal to find his brother.
Hey, hey.
Relax.
If he thinks we're really on the run...
We're not in the prison yard anymore.
It's gonna be hard to keep the whole ruse going out in the real world.
We're business partners now, huh?
It might be harder stuck in this room.
- Right.
- Yeah.
I promised the brass we'd be in complete control
And if you come back with a dollar less than we talked about, of this situation at all times.
I'm gonna have my brother, Dean, run you over in the parking lot.
See?
That's why I never make promises.
Remember that.
Big Tommy is all systems go.
You seeing the blonde?
This guy gonna show or what?
The one with the Glock?
Big Tommy's nothing if not reliable.
Let's go.
Top dollar, Ray.
L.A.P.D.!
Put your hands where I can see them!
No friend discounts, no side deals.
- Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
- Put your hands where I can see them!
There he is.
Hey!
Hey, hey.
Relax.
Get out of here.
You're gonna want to get out of here.
We're not in the prison yard anymore.
That's sweet of you, Ray.
We're business partners now, huh?
Oh, my stomach hurts.
Right.
Yeah.
Take it easy.
And if you come back
Come on, take it easy!
with a dollar less than we talked about,
We set up one deal, and the cops bust us?
I'm gonna have my brother, Dean,
Screw easy!
run you over in the parking lot.
They were after Big Tommy.
It wasn't even about us.
You seeing the blonde?
Ray strike you as the strong, silent type?
The one with the glock?
H-he's probably trading up everything he knows about us
Let's go.
right now to save his own ass.
L.A.P.D.!
Put your hands where I can see them!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Your girlfriend's gonna be pissed, huh?
Put your hands where I can see them!
Ow!
No!
You think?
Psst!
Psst!
Get out of here.
All right.
So, look.
We I... we lay low until we come up with a plan.
You're gonna want to get out of here.
Plans take money.
That's sweet of you, Ray.
Which, thanks to Ray, we're still short on.
Oh.
Look, boys.
Oh, my stomach hurts.
I think it's time we ended our brief, but deeply meaningful, partnership.
Take it easy.
Good luck, huh?
Come on, take it easy!
What?
Suddenly you got some place to go?
!
We set up one deal, and the cops bust us?
Hey, get your hands off of me!
Screw easy!
Back off!
Hey, get your hands off of me!
They were after big Tommy.
It wasn't even about us.
Stop it, both of you!
Ray strike you as the strong, silent type?
Come on, man!
H-he's probably trading up everything he knows about us
From what I hear, right now to save his own ass.
your brother's pretty good at hiding out.
Your girlfriend's gonna be pissed, huh?
Now, you call him and tell him we need a place to stay,
You think?
All right.
Why would I do that?
So, look.
We I... we lay low until we come up with a plan.
Because we saved your ass...
Plans take money.
...twice,
Which, thanks to Ray, we're still short on.
and you owe us.
Look, boys.
And you know as well as I do your brother's our best chance at staying free.
I think it's time we ended our brief,
He's not gonna be easy to find, man.
but deeply meaningful, partnership.
Then we better get started.
Good luck, huh?
What?
Suddenly you got some place to go?
!
It's goosedown, water resistant.
Hey, get your hands off of me!
Real soft...
Go ahead, give it a feel.
Back off!
Hey, get your hands off of me!
You ever been, uh, beach camping?
Stop it, both of you!
Come on, man!
It's pretty romantic.
From what I hear,
Hold on one second.
your brother's pretty good at hiding out.
What's up, Neal?
Now, you call him and tell him we need a place to stay.
Thought you were in the clink.
Why would I do that?
Yeah, well, good behavior, man.
Because we saved your ass...
Twice,
We need to talk.
In private.
and you owe us.
All right.
And you know as well as I do
What do you say we give that thing a test-drive?
your brother's our best chance at staying free.
If you broke out, leave now.
He's not gonna be easy to find, man.
I do not need that kind of heat, man, seriously.
Then we better get started.
We're looking for Kyle.
It's goosedown, water resistant.
Has he come to see you lately?
Real soft...
Go ahead, give it a feel.
Yeah, I've...
I've seen him.
You ever been, uh, beach camping?
And if I see him again, he's dead.
It's pretty romantic.
Kyle came in here looking for some guns.
Hold on one second.
Told him, "Sure.
Why not?
Just like old times, right?"
What's up, neal?
Thought you were in the clink.
Except this time, your douchebag brother decided not to pay me.
Yeah, well, good behavior, man.
He jacked you?
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
We need to talk.
In private.
Told me to consider it a donation for the movement.
All right.
I fronted for the guns, man.
He put me in a real bad financial situation,
What do you say we give that thing a test-drive?
'cause, see, contrary to appearances,
Phew!
Glenn's big outdoors...
Not doing so great.
If you broke out, leave now.
Do you know where he is?
I do not need that kind of heat, man, seriously.
No.
We're looking for Kyle.
And I don't want to know.
Has he come to see you lately?
Well, if we can find him, we can get your money.
Yeah, I've...
I've seen him.
You don't get it, do you?
And if I see him again, he's dead.
I don't want my money.
Kyle came in here looking for some guns.
He's changed, Neal.
Told him, "sure.
Why not?
Just like old times, right?"
Okay?
I don't want anything to do with that crazy son of a bitch.
Except this time,
And now that I know what he's planning... your douchebag brother decided not to pay me.
...neither should you.
He jacked you?
Yeah.
I think you guys should leave.
Told me to consider it a donation for the movement.
I got your call.
I fronted for the guns, man.
Dean's coming in.
He says they have something on Kyle Erikson.
He put me in a real bad financial situation,
Did you have Ty doing some sort of surveillance in Compton?
'cause, see, contrary to appearances,
He did...
A few weeks ago.
Glenn's big outdoors...
Not doing so great.
Turned out to be a dead end.
Do you know where he is?
What?
No.
Nothing.
And I don't want to know.
Hey, did you run a bg on our man?
Well, if we can find him, we can get your money.
Yeah.
Glenn Fischer.
You don't get it, do you?
He's been picked up a couple of times for buying and selling illegal guns.
I don't want my money.
Okay, well, Glenn fischer said that Erikson came in recently to buy hardware off him.
He's changed, neal.
Okay?
Did he say for what?
I don't want anything to do with that crazy son of a bitch.
No, we didn't get that far.
But he did say it was for something big.
And now that I know what he's planning...
Got to give Erikson props...
Shoots an A.T.F. agent and still won't lay low?
Neither should you.
Guy's a player.
I think you guys should leave.
Haul his ass in.
See if he really knows anything.
I got your call.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wait a minute, now.
I don't know.
Dean's coming in.
Even though Glenn hates Erikson, he's still got that "don't tread on me" attitude.
He says they have something on Kyle Erikson.
He may not talk, even if we ask politely.
Did you have ty doing some sort of surveillance in compton?
We still got the same guns as before,
I did...
A few weeks ago.
so if Glenn's still dealing,
Turned out to be a dead end.
we just sell him a couple, pop him.
What?
All right.
Take a run at Glenn with Jaimie.
Nothing.
Hey, Dean.
Mmm.
Hey, did you run a bg on our man?
How close Neal to finding his brother?
Yeah.
Glenn fischer.
Still working on it.
He's been picked up a couple of times
Can Carter really keep this contained?
for buying and selling illegal guns.
100%.
Okay, well, Glenn fischer said that Erikson came in recently
Ty, where the hell are you?
You're gonna be late for your own sting.
to buy hardware off him.
Thank you.
I appreciate it.
Did he say for what?
Hello.
No, we didn't get that far.
Welcome to "Glenn's big outdoors".
But he did say it was for something big.
What can I do you for?
Got to give Erikson props...
I need help.
Shoots an atf Agent and still won't lay low?
Well, I'm always happy to help a damsel in distress.
Guy's a player.
Oh.
Haul his ass in.
See if he really knows anything.
I need a gun.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wait a minute, now.
I don't know.
What kind of gun?
Even though Glenn hates Erikson,
I don't know.
he's still got that "don't tread on me" attitude.
I was mugged a few months ago.
The guy had a knife, so it shook me up pretty bad.
He may not talk, even if we ask politely.
Yeah, I bet it did.
Were you hurt?
We still got the same guns as before,
No, but he got my money.
so if Glenn's still dealing,
The truth is, I don't like guns, but the police were so freakin' useless.
we just sell him a couple, pop him.
I know what you mean.
All right.
Take a run at Glenn with jaimie.
A GUN IN THE HAND IS BETTER THAN A COP ON THE PHONE
Hey, Dean.
I think I got exactly what you need.
How close is neal to finding his brother?
Right here.
Still working on it.
Simple.
Can Carter really keep this contained?
Reliable.
100%.
- Yeah.
- Whoa.
Ty, where the hell are you?
Wow.
It's heavy.
You're gonna be late for your own sting.
You've never shot before.
Hello.
I could show you how.
Welcome to Glenn's big outdoors.
That'd be great.
What can I do you for?
Really?
Ah...
I-I mean...
I need help.
...cool.
Well, I'm always happy to help a damsel in distress.
There's one problem.
Oh.
When I was younger, I got a couple petty thefts,
I need a gun.
and they were bumped up into felonies.
What kind of gun?
Is there any way around that?
I don't know.
Anything for you, doll.
I was mugged a few months ago.
This is a gun here...
The guy had a knife, so it shook me up pretty bad.
...that doesn't necessarily need to be registered.
Yeah, I bet it did.
Were you hurt?
Well, how much?
No, but he got my money.
Make me an offer.
The truth is, I don't like guns,
Ok.
but the police were so freakin' useless.
Cash only.
I know what you mean.
Aw, you got to be kidding me.
I think I got exactly what you need.
So, Alex is grilling Glenn.
Right here.
It turns out he has three weapons charges,
Simple.
so if he knows anything, he's gonna talk.
Reliable.
You didn't have to pull an audible.
Yeah.
Whoa.
I had no choice.
You were late.
Wow.
It's heavy.
I was three minutes late.
You've never shot before.
A lot can happen in three minutes.
I could show you how.
Okay.
I'm sorry, Jaimie.
That'd be great.
You working surveillance again last night?
Really?
Why do you say it like that?
I-I mean...
'Cause I talked to Alex.
Cool.
The surveillance she asked you to do was over two weeks ago.
There's one problem.
You checking up on me now?
When I was younger, I got a couple petty thefts,
Don't deflect.
What's up with the girl?
and they were bumped up into felonies.
She's having fun, Jaimie.
I'm having fun.
Is there any way around that?
No foul, no harm, right?
Anything for you, doll.
What you do on your own personal time is your business.
This is a gun here
Just don't let it screw up my job.
that doesn't necessarily need to be registered.
Good time for a drink?
Well, how much?
It's always a good time for a drink in this place, man.
Uh...
Make me an offer.
Is that Neal?
Okay.
Frankie.
Cash only.
I'm assuming this visit isn't sanctioned by the California Department of Corrections.
Aw, you got to be kidding me.
Nope.
So, Alex is grilling Glenn.
- This is, uh...
- We don't need to use names.
It turns out he has three weapons charges,
This is a friend of mine.
so if he knows anything, he's gonna talk.
Friends drink free here.
You didn't have to pull an audible.
What kind of bar you running here, Frankie?
I had no choice.
You were late.
It's more like a...
I was three minutes late.
...social club.
A lot can happen in three minutes.
Listen, you seen Kyle around?
Has he come by for a drink, maybe some relief?
Okay.
I'm sorry, jaimie.
Baby, it's been a long time since your brother's had to pay for it.
You working surveillance again last night?
He did call, though, looking for some money.
Why do you say it like that?
You got a phone number?
'Cause I talked to Alex.
Might not even be good anymore.
You know how cautious he is.
The surveillance she asked you to do was over two weeks ago.
Let's go.
You checking up on me now?
What's the rush?
Don't deflect.
What's up with the girl?
You boys are welcome to stay.
She's having fun, jaimie.
I'm having fun.
Everything free for friends?
No foul, no harm, right?
Just drinks.
What you do on your own personal time is your business.
We're a little light on cash right now.
Just don't let it screw up my job.
Next time.
Good time for a drink?
Hey.
It's always a good time for a drink in this place, man.
I'm glad you and your brother worked past all that crap.
Is that neal?
I didn't really have a choice, did I?
Frankie.
We should go back to the hotel, call your brother.
I'm assuming this visit isn't sanctioned
This is all I got left.
by the California department of corrections.
Pump number three.
Nope.
Excuse me.
This is, uh...
Can I help you, officers?
We don't need to use names.
We saw you across the street.
You know you have a broken taillight?
This is a friend of mine.
I'll get that fixed right away.
Sorry about that.
Friends drink free here.
Can I see your license and registration?
What kind of bar you running here, Frankie?
Listen, I'm a cop.
It's more like a social club.
Lieutenant Carter Shaw.
L.A.P.D.
Listen, you seen Kyle around?
I'm in the middle of an undercover case.
Has he come by for a drink, maybe some relief?
I need you to get back in your patrol unit and drive away.
Baby, it's been a long time
You got to do better than that, buddy.
since your brother's had to pay for it.
Call it in now...
He did call, though, looking for some money.
L.A.P.D. or FBI.
Ask for Agent Alex Rice.
You got a phone number?
So now you're a fed.
Might not even be good anymore.
Where's your junior g-man badge, then?
You know how cautious he is.
Listen, don't ruin your careers over this, guys.
Let's go.
All right, secret agent man, step back.
What's the rush?
Get down on the ground, man.
You boys are welcome to stay.
Get his gun.
Everything free for friends?
Let's go.
Just drinks.
How you like me now, bitch?
Ah.
We're a little light on cash right now.
I said, "let's go".
Next time.
What are you gonna do, man?
Hey.
You gonna shoot me over this pig?
I'm glad you and your brother worked past all that crap.
Kill you or go down for killing a cop?
I didn't really have a choice, did I?
Easy choice.
We should gogo back to the hot, call your brother.
Yeah.
This is all I got left.
Nice!
Pump number three.
Hey.
What's up?
Excuse me.
Just checking in.
Can I help you, officers?
See if you were planning on shooting any old ladies or puppies after
We saw you across the street.
jacking those two cops.
You know you have a broken taillight?
Yeah.
Well, you see, the thing about that was...
Uh, I'll get that fixed right away.
Sorry about that.
Do you have any idea how big of a deal that was?
Can I see your license and registration?
I had it under control, Alex.
Listen, I'm a cop.
You let a convicted felon put a gun on an officer.
Lieutenant Carter Shaw.
L.A.P.D.
We got a phone number for Kyle Erikson.
I'm in the middle of an undercover case.
Neal and Dean are upstairs right now waiting for a callback.
I need you to get back in your patrol unit and drive away.
We're close to getting Erikson.
Come on.
I got this.
You got to do better than that, buddy.
I should pull you for being such a pain in the ass.
Call it in now...
L.A.P.D. Or FBI.
Why don't you put that in my evaluation report?
Ask for Agent Alex rice.
It's been a whole day.
So now you're a fed.
Your brother gonna call or what?
Where's your junior g-man badge, then?
If it's his number,
Listen, don't ruin your careers over this, guys.
he'll call.
All right, secret Agent man, step back.
That bartender said something about you getting over something with Kyle.
Get down on the ground, man.
What'd she mean?
Get his gun.
Man, w-what did you do,
Let's go.
watch some kind of self-help TV while I was taking a leak?
How you like me now, bitch?
I just want to know if you can deliver on this.
I said, "let's go."
If you can't, then no offense, but you can go to hell.
What are you gonna do, man?
I was doing time in Chino for something Kyle did.
You gonna shoot me over this pig?
You took the rap for him?
Kill you or go down for killing a cop?
Yeah.
Easy choice.
Him and one of his dumb militia men,
Yeah.
knocked over a jewelry store in Portland.
Nice!
The feds caught up with Reese,
Hey.
and he told them it was me he hit that store with,
What's up?
not Kyle.
Just checking in.
He told him to say that?
See if you were planning on
Why the hell would you go along with something like that?
shooting any old ladies or puppies
'Cause he'd do the same for me.
after jacking those two cops.
You sure about that?
Yeah.
Hello?
Well, you see, the thing about that was...
Yeah.
Do you have any idea how big of a deal that was?
It's been a long time, Kyle.
I had it under control, Alex.
Long time.
You let a convicted felon put a gun on an officer.
Good news...
We got a phone number for Kyle Erikson.
Kyle Erikson called back.
He agreed to hide us.
Neal andean are upstairs right now waiting for a callback.
- Where is he?
- I didn't speak to him directly.
We're close to getting Erikson.
Come on.
I got this.
Neal arranged it.
We're supposed to meet him downtown at midnight.
I should pull you for being such a pain in the ass.
Good.
That's when we'll take him.
Why don't you put that in my evaluation report?
Jaimie and Ty find out what Erikson's big plan is from Glenn?
It's been a whole day.
All Glenn said is that Erikson was planning on assassinating someone.
Your brother gonna call or what?
- We had to cut him loose after that.
- He give you a name?
If it's his number, he'll call.
No, but he did say it was gonna be a political statement.
That bartender said something
We're checking to see if there's anyone that Erikson has a grudge with.
about you getting over something with Kyle.
A political statement doesn't have to be personal.
Just has to be big.
What'd she mean?
He'll be looking to hit someone who will get him some press.
Man, w-what did you do,
We'll bust Erikson tonight and find out who he's targeting.
watch some kind of self-help tv while I was taking a leak?
Or...
I just want to know if you can deliver on this.
We don't take him tonight.
If you can't, then no offense, but you can go to hell.
I could stay under and find out who he's targeting from the inside.
I was doing time in chino for something Kyle did.
No.
You took the rap for him?
What do you mean, "no"?
Why the hell not?
Yeah.
This is coming from my boss.
Him and one of his dumb militia men, Reese,
I told him we didn't have an exact I.D. On Erikson's target.
knocked over a jewelry store in Portland.
He said if we have a chance to take Erikson, we take him
The feds caught up with Reese,
Deal with the assassination later.
Busting him doesn't mean we'll stop the hit.
and he told them it was me he hit that store with,
I mean, Erikson may be a megalomaniac, but he's not dumb.
not Kyle.
He'll probably send one of his little disciples to do it.
He told him to say that?
That's your opinion.
Why the hell would you go along with something like that?
I'm just doing what's best for this case.
'Cause he'd do the same for me.
Good.
The case is Kyle Erikson.
You sure about that?
We're taking him tonight.
Hello?
There they are.
Yeah.
What are we looking for?
It's been a long time, Kyle.
I don't know.
Long time.
He just said meet him here...
Good news...
Kyle Erikson called back.
...midnight.
He agreed to hide us.
Where is he?
Wait.
I didn't speak to him directly.
Neal arranged it.
That's him.
We're supposed to meet him downtown at midnight.
Did you see them?
Good.
That's when we'll take him.
See who?
Jaimie and ty find out what Erikson's big plan is from Glenn?
Back there.
All Glenn said is that Erikson
The truck.
was planning on assassinating someone.
We're fucked.
We had to cut him loose after that.
He give you a name?
I didn't see anything.
No, but he did say it was gonna be a political statement.
They're there.
Trust me.
We're checking to see if there's anyone that Erikson has a grudge with.
Okay.
What do you want to do?
A political statement doesn't have to be personal.
Looks like they're loading into Erikson's van.
Just has to be big.
Get ready.
He'll be looking to hit someone who will get him some press.
Get out of the van.
We'll bust Erikson tonight and find out who he's targeting.
What the hell are you doing?
Or...
We don't take him tonight.
Is there some kind of asshole pill they give you guys at the academy?
I could stay under and find out who he's targeting from the inside.
I gave you and Carter exact orders.
No.
What do you mean, "no"?
Why the hell not?
He snuck a cellphone in.
He'll call as soon as he figures out who Erikson's targeting, okay?
This is coming from my boss.
What if Erikson finds the cellphone on him?
I told him we didn't have an exact I.D. On Erikson's target.
What if they decide they just don't want Carter around anymore and shoot him?
!
He said if we have a chance to take Erikson, we take him.
He'll call.
Deal with the assassination later.
Get with Ty and Jaimie and check out the van.
Busting him doesn't mean we'll stop the hit.
See if there's anything you can get off it about where they might have taken Carter.
I mean, Erikson may be a megalomaniac, but he's not dumb.
Okay.
You know, he's just doing what's best for the case.
He'll probably send one of his little disciples to do it.
I'm getting tired of hearing that.
That's your opinion.
I'm just doing what's best for this case.
Slick move with your brother...
Good.
The case is Kyle Erikson.
Sending him out as a decoy.
We're taking him tonight.
Any idea how they were on to you?
There they are.
I was about to ask you the same thing.
What are we looking for?
That's Len...
I don't know.
Man of few words.
He just said meet him here, midnight.
He's a good soldier.
Wait.
No idea why the cops were there?
That's him.
All I know is that I busted Neal out,
Did you see them?
and I kept his ass safe,
See who?
and then I gave up my brother so you could get away.
Back there.
That's what I know.
The truck.
Len...
I didn't see anything.
Get our guest some coffee.
They're there.
Trust me.
Neal's always stepping in it.
Okay.
What do you want to do?
Even when we were kids, needed someone to show him the way.
Looks like they're loading into Erikson's van.
If I hadn't hired a girl to bust his cherry,
Get ready.
I think he'd still be a virgin.
Get out of the van.
That's, uh, Wendy.
What the hell are you doing?
That's grace.
Come on, girls.
Is there some kind of asshole pill they give you guys at the academy?
Show Mr. Pine some hospitality.
I gave you and Carter exact orders.
If I knew this is what you militia guys did, I would have joined up years ago.
He snuck a cellphone in.
We have restrictions, of course.
He'll call as soon as he figures out who Erikson's targeting, okay?
Of course.
What if Erikson finds the cellphone on him?
I think my brother would like some company.
What if they decide they just don't want Carter around anymore
Enjoy yourself.
and shoot him?
!
Did you miss me?
He'll call.
Anything off the van?
Get with ty and jaimie and check out the van.
No.
See if there's anything you can get off it
Looks like Erikson stole it out of Tarzana yesterday.
about where they might have taken Carter.
Ty and Dean are trying to run it down, but...
Okay.
You know, he's just doing what's best for the case.
Carter?
I'm getting tired of hearing that.
Sorry.
Tell him I'll call him back.
Slick move with your brother...
You're really worried.
Sending him out as a decoy.
Erikson's a big case.
Any idea how they were on to you?
I mean about Carter.
I was about to ask you the same thing.
Yeah, well, aren't you?
That's len...
Man of few words.
Take it easy on the bear.
He's a good soldier.
I know...
No idea why the cops were there?
we planned this for later,
All I know is that I busted neal out,
but what with my brother showing up, people might be looking for him.
and I kept his ass safe,
Don't know how much longer we'll be safe here.
and then I gave up my brother so you could get away.
It's our chance to make history.
That's what I know.
One bullet...
Len... in Washburn Get our guest some coffee.
...will change everything.
Huh?
Neal's always stepping in it.
Be another shot heard 'round the world.
Even when we were kids,
They'll write poems about it.
needed someone to show him the way.
I know I can count on you.
If I hadn't hired a girl to bust his cherry,
Rice.
I think he'd still be a virgin.
It Carter.
Ah.
Where are you?
That's, uh, Wendy.
That's grace.
Erikson's looking to kill someone named Washburn.
Come on, girls.
Federal courthouse.
Show Mr. pine some hospitality.
Look for, uh, prosecutors, judges... something like that.
If I knew this is what you militia guys did,
Okay, uh, there's a federal judge named Washburn.
I would have joined up years ago.
Looks like he ruled a big case against some of these militia types last year.
Mm-hmm.
That's got to be it.
Find him.
We have restrictions, of course.
This is officer Jaimie Allen with the l.A.P.D.
Of course.
I need to speak with judge Washburn.
I think my brother would like some company.
Where are you?
Mmm.
Erikson's not making the hit himself.
He sent someone else...
Enjoy yourself.
A kid, maybe 24, thin,
Did you miss me?
Mm-hmm.
black hair, crew cut.
Hmm?
We'll get to Washburn, Carter.
Anything off the van?
Alex, he already sent him.
You have to move now.
No.
No one can get him on his cell.
Looks like Erikson stole it out of tarzana yesterday.
He's due in court right now.
Ty and Dean are trying to run it down, but...
We have to get to him first.
Carter?
Carter, where the hell are you?
Sorry.
Tell him I'll call him back.
Put down the damn phone.
You're really worried.
Carter's cover's blown.
Erikson's a big case.
Let's get to the judge.
I mean about Carter.
What about Carter?
Yeah, well, aren't you?
There's no time.
Mm-hmm.
Call Ty and Dean.
Take it easy on the bear.
What the hell are you doing?
I know we planned this for later,
I'm a cop, Neal.
but what with my brother showing up,
Damn.
people might be looking for him.
I did not see that coming.
Don't know how much longer we'll be safe here.
Put the gun down.
It's our chance to make history.
Why?
One bullet in washburn...
Why would I do that?
Will change everything.
Because your brother...
Be another shot heard 'round the world.
is about to execute a federal judge.
They'll write poems about it.
And no matter what happens, you'll be an accomplice.
I know I can count on you.
You already took the fall for him once, Neal.
Don't do it again.
Rice.
So, what?
It Carter.
Where are you?
You gonna help me...
Erikson's looking to kill someone named washburn.
Is that it?
...
Federal courthouse.
If I cooperate?
Look for, uh, prosecutors, judges... something like that.
Please.
Okay, uh, there's a federal judge named washburn.
Kyle!
Get in here!
Looks like he ruled a big case
What the hell is this?
against some of these militia types last year.
He's a cop.
That's got to be it.
Find him.
Drop your gun, Kyle.
This is officer jaimie Allen with the l.A.P.D.
Kyle, don't.
I need to speak with judge washburn.
I can't believe he shot me.
Where are you?
There he is.
Erikson's not making the hit himself.
Hold on!
Hold on!
He sent someone else...
A kid, maybe 24,
- L.A.P.D.
- Alright.
Stay where you are!
thin, black hair, crew cut.
Judge Washburn.
I'm special agent Alex Rice, FBI.
We'll get to washburn, Carter.
L.A.P.D.
Alex, he already sent him.
FBI!
You have to move now.
There's been a threat made on your life.
No one can get him on his cell.
Gun!
He's due in court right now.
Drop it.
We have to get to him first.
Drop it!
Carter, where the hell are you?
I surrender.
Put down the damn phone.
You killed your brother just to try to get away?
Carter's cover's blown.
What are little brothers for?
Let's get to the judge.
You're sick.
What about Carter?
Hey.
There's no time.
Yeah, I'm fine.
Call ty and Dean.
Yeah.
What the hell are you doing?
Good.
Good.
I'm a cop, neal.
All right, I'll see you later.
Damn.
I will be a national hero for what I did today,
I did not see that coming.
even in jail.
Put the gun down.
Don't start writing your memoirs just yet.
Why?
Why would I do that?
They stopped crew cut and your girlfriend
Because your brother is about to execute a federal judge,
before they could get to judge Washburn.
and no matter what happens, you'll be an accomplice.
You're a joke.
You already took the fall for him once, neal.
That was some old-school undercover, lieutenant.
Great job.
Don't do it again.
I wish I was under with Laker girls,
So, what?
but we worked it out.
You gonna help me...
Is that it?
... if I cooperate?
Where you going?
Please.
Good job today.
Kyle!
Get in here!
I didn't even see her coming.
What the hell is this?
Well, you got the primary suspect.
He's a cop.
I just got lucky.
Drop your gun, Kyle.
Nah.
You're good.
Kyle, don't.
I wasn't judging your night life.
I can't believe he shot me.
I just want to do a good job.
There he is.
You probably think I'm an asshole that I split up with Mel, huh?
Judge.
L.A.P.D. Judge washburn.
No.
Hey!
I'm special Agent Alex rice, FBI.
I get it.
L.A.P.D.
Really?
Put your guns down!
Our jobs are great.
L.A.P.D. FBI.
Just not a lot of room for other people.
There's been a threat made on your life.
Maybe in the long run, you did her a favor, huh?
Put your guns down!
Good night.
Gun!
He good?
Drop it.
Drop it!
Hungry?
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah.
Ah-ah.
No, I ate.
Ah.
Sex?
I surrender.
Nice try.
How about a beer?
You killed your brother just to try to get away?
Sure.
What are little brothers for?
So...
You're sick.
Your bosses must be happy.
Aah!
Got Kyle Erikson, saved a life.
Hey.
They're happy about the bust.
Yeah, I'm fine.
But when the bureau gives you an order, you're expected to follow it,
Yeah.
so I guess I won't be getting a gold star on my evaluation.
Good.
Good.
You know I really don't care what you write about me in your report.
All right, I'll see you later.
I think you care that we're sleeping together, we work together,
I will be a national hero for what I did today,
and I get to tell people what I really think about you.
even in jail.
Well, when you put it like that.
Don't start writing your memoirs just yet.
All right.
They stopped crew cut and your girlfriend
Let's make it even.
before they could get to judge washburn.
Give me an honest evaluation.
You're a joke.
Really?
Gah!
Special Agent Alex Rice...
That was some old-school undercover, lieutenant.
Great job.
...exhibits sharp tactical skills,
I wish I was under with laker girls,
good leadership qualities... but we worked it out.
I like it so far.
Where you going?
...But lacks creativity,
Good job today.
and can be inflexible.
I didn't even see her coming.
"Inflexible."
Well, you got the primary suspect.
Just being honest.
I just got lucky.
So am I.
Nah.
You're good.
Okay.
Finally.
I wasn't judging your night life.

Just not a lot of room for other people.
Just add "opinionated" and "charmless," and I think you nailed it.
Maybe in the long run, you did her a favor, huh?
It's a joke, Carter.
I can't show you the real report.
Good night.
You look like you could use a steak and a couple Martinis, on me.
Mmm.
If it's on you.
He good?
Mm-hmm.
You know...

Now I get it.
I've been saying for months, that these anti-government extremist groups are a huge problem.
Yeah.
Erikson's been a bomb waiting to go off, even before arroyo.
Atf.
They're worried about Kyle Erikson.
Maybe that's got something to do with the fact that he shot one of their agents and got away with it.
What's up?
Oh.
You, uh...
Left this on the nightstand last night.
Thank you.
I don't think that's necessary, Lisa.
All of our intel says that he's here in L.A.
And we've got an undercover in right now with an accomplice of erikson's named Kenneth Cobb.
You're the first to know.

Didn't know you were spying on us.
It's that time of year, Carter.
It happens to all of us.
I get evaluated by my boss.
And I get evaluated by mine...
You.
You really care what it says about you in a report?
No.
And less than no.
You?
You mean, do I ever want to make more than $60,000 a year and stop living out of a suitcase?
Yes.
You make that much?
[ Telephone rings ]
Agent rice.
What?
!
We're on the way.
Apparently, there's a couple of sheriffs outside the house where Dean is.
Can you pull the sheriffs off?
Already at the door.
[ Police radio chatter ]
[ Heavy-metal music playing ]
[ Knock on door ] Cop:
Sheriff's department!
Open the door!
Whoo!
Brother, it is on!
Think about this, kenny, okay?
Hold on.
They got no right to be here, man.
This is private property!
You stole a car, and it's parked in your driveway.
It's not an invitation, but come on, kenny.
No, man.
This is just pretense.
This is how they do it.
Little by little, they're taking our country away from us.
Open up!
Open the door!
Now!
Will you...
Will you turn the music down and talk to me, kenny, please?
Or at least take it off repeat.
What are you...
What are you doing, kenny?
Come on.
Exercising my rights as a sovereign citizen.
She's been itching for this.
A little something for you, too, baby.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Cobb, look.
I did not hook up with you to kill cops, okay?
The only reason I'm here is 'cause you said you were in with Kyle Erikson.
Screw Erikson!
We're on the front lines now, dawg!
So what, kenny, we're not joining up with them, huh?
Is that what you're telling me?
Why the hell do you keep asking me about Erikson?
W-why, man?
Why?
'Cause he's a legend.
Come on, man.
You heard about arroyo.
Atf busts his compound.
One of them gets hit.
Cop:
Sheriff's department!
Open the door!
Big deal!
Erikson probably didn't even pull the trigger!
So, you lied.
You don't even work with Erikson.
Don't sweat it, bro.
[ Laughing ] We're about to be way bigger than Erikson.
Or do I have to do you before these pigs?
No.
Let's do it.
Let's do it!
Here we go.
On three.
Ready?
Yeah!
One...
Two...
Oh, uh, kenny, one thing.
I'm a cop.
[ Gunshot, music stops ]
Where's ty?
Getting his beauty sleep.
Careful, Dean.
Alex might put that in her evaluation report.
It's just a routine report.
Okay.
Well, don't forget our excessive use of force and a liberal interpretation of the Miranda rights.
Got anything new from Cobb?
No.
We put him under the lamp, but he gave us nothing new.
I thought he was part of Kyle Erikson's extremist group.
Liberty sons?
No.
They had a falling-out.
And according to Cobb,
Erikson thinks of himself as a kind of messiah.
Wants to be a rock star.
Seen his fan-page websites?
Guy's got groupies.
Jaimie:
He's a good-looking guy.
Bad guys can be good-looking.
Did Cobb give up anyone else who might be in contact with Erikson?
I mean, someone's helping him hide out.
The only thing Cobb hates worse than Erikson is police.
Even if he knew something, he wouldn't tell us.
So we're nowhere.
I got someone.
Neal Erikson...
Kyle's younger brother.
The two seem close...
First bouncing around foster homes, then partners in crime.
We talked about this guy before.
He's in jail.
15 years, armed robbery.
Atf already questioned him in prison.
There's no way he's gonna flip on his brother.
We don't flip him.
We use him to lead us to his brother.
And how the hell are we gonna do that?
We break him out of jail.
[ knocking on door ]
[ Sis ]
Really?
Good morning.
Yeah.
Tough night?
You missed the meeting.
I did?
Mm-hmm.
I was working late.
On the Erikson case?
Uh...
No, actually.
Alex had me working surveil on someone out in compton, a fed thing.
Wow, man.
This lasagna and veggies is a hell of a science experiment.
Guess you've been burning at both ends since you and Melissa split, huh?
No, not really.
What did I miss?
Carter has a plan to catch Erikson, but it needs a lot of prep.
Let me jump in the shower.
Would it kill you to use a glass?
[ Police radio chatter ]
[ Buzzer sounds ]
Neal Erikson...
Transfer to L.A. correctional.
Copy that.
Watch your step.
Got another transfer.
Actually, I only got an order for two, sir.
He was supposed to go this morning, but his tummy hurt.
It's an intestinal disorder...
Possibly an ulcer, which, by the way, if ignored, is an actionable offense.
He's all yours.
You're Kyle Erikson's brother, aren't you?
What's it to you, man?
Nothing.
Just hear the dudes in the yard talking about him like he's some kind of hero, so...
Your brother's that militia guy?
I saw him on "america's most wanted assholes," right?
I can't get you an autograph, if that's where this is headed.
[ Clears throat ] Ray Blake.
Pine.
Carter pine.
Prison doc says I need surgery.
Like I'd let those hacks cut me open.
The only prison docs worth any damn good are at San Quentin.
That's where I'm headed.
That right?
First thing you got to check out in the joint...
Medical facilities, honestly.
You talk a lot, Ray.
Yeah, it's a nervous tic.
No big deal.
Alex:
They should be close.
Jaimie:
Oh.
So, what's this evaluation report all about?
Are we being judged?
No.
Yes.
But don't worry...
I think you do a great job, and I know it's not easy.
Thanks, sister.
I'm serious.
Keep it up, you're gonna have an amazing career.
Ty and Carter coming your way, Dean.
[ Tires screech ]
Don't move.
Don't move.
Give me the gun now.
I know you got it on you.
Give me the gun.
Let's go!
All right, keys...
Let's go.
Let's go!
Get out... now!
Let's go!
Get out.
Shut the door.
Shut it!
How you doing, brother?
[ chuckles ]
That's your brother?
You were right about that guard.
[ chuckles ] 500 bucks and a lap dance from Irene, and he sang about this transfer.
Nice work.
Here you go.
All right, what about these two?
Kill them?
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Are you sure that's what you want to do?
'Cause there's other options.
I think what the human chihuahua is trying to say is that adding two homicides to what is otherwise a clean getaway is stupid.
Ground rules...
You do anything I don't like, I shoot you in the face.
Anyone got a problem with that?
You waiting for a show of hands?
Come on!
Let's go!
Go, go!
Let's go!
Go!
[ engine revs ]
This your place?
Nah, my old lady's.
Alex:
You get the hell out of here!
[ Glass shatters ]
Baby!
Don't you "baby" me.
I didn't think you two were dumb enough to break out of jail.
What, no hello kiss?
Shut up.
You bring two felons here with you?
Are you crazy?
What are you thinking?
They're never happy to see you when you first get out of the joint.
We just need a place to lie low till the heat dies.
That's all.
Come on, baby.
You know I can't live without you.
Hmm?
Come on.
Come to daddy.
Want me to do that thing I do to you?
[ Both laugh ]
[ Smooching ]
Two days.
After that, I'll call the cops on you myself.
This reunion is touching, but, uh, I'm out, fellas.
Thanks for the ride.
Nobody's going anywhere.
Hey, listen.
You tell your lady what to do, okay?
Not me.
You got someplace better to go?
Yeah.
A beach in Mexico.
And how you gonna get there?
Oh, I'm a resourceful guy.
Yeah.
Well, let me put it to you this way.
You get caught, you could throw the cops to us.
And I can't have that.
I don't know what to tell you.
You point that thing at me again,
I'm gonna shove it so far up your ass.
Don't be stupid.
You want to stay free, we need money.
Yeah, and clothes.
Clothes, we can get.
And money?
Bro, you still got that stash?
Yeah.
I'll get it.
Good.
Come on, it's not like that.
[ Laughs ]
Okay.
All right.
Okay.
Yeah.
I'll call you later.
Bye.
Met a girl.
Yeah, I guess you could say that.
Where?
Funny thing is I met her on the surveil in compton.
Dating a mark?
No.
But she helped sell the cover.
Carter's got them all at his house.
Now, how in the hell did Ray Blake end up in the van?
No choice, Alex.
They threw the dude in.
[ Sighs ] We'll deal with him later.
Jaimie:
Why don't we let neal go?
Trail him while he looks up his brother?
And what if he decides to rip off a liquor store or shoot a nun?
Good point.
Look, I promised that we'd be in complete control of neal while we had him out.
Okay.
So how do we motivate him to find his brother, huh?
What do these extremists like more than anything?
You think they could have found me something more conspicuous?
Honestly, the damn thing's bright enough to read by.
Shut up, Ray.
These are all clean, untraceable.
Think your brother might be in the market?
Why are you so interested in my brother?
Because we need money, and your brother sounds like someone who likes guns.
I haven't spoken to my brother in three years.
That's called "going to prison."
And even if I did know where he is, why would I put him in business with a bunch of fugitives like you?
Well, wouldn't he want to help out his little brother?
Hey.
I don't need my brother fixing my problems, okay?
[ Clears throat ] I might know somebody.
Yeah.
Good friend of mine.
He's always looking for guns.
See?
Solves the whole problem.
Yeah, what's his name?
Big Tommy.
[ Chuckles ] "Big Tommy"?
Okay.
What's big Tommy's last name?
W-what does it matter?
You want us to do a deal with your good friend, whose last name you don't even know?
Yeah.
Shut up, Ray.
Just shut up.
Geez.
Yeah, shut up, Ray.
Neal didn't go for the guns.
What's the problem?
There might be a little less brotherly love there than I thought.
[ Groans ]
Can I help you, Ray?
Yeah, my stomach is killing me.
Did you get any of that pink crap?
No!
Geez.
What kind of house is this, anyway?
How long have you lived here?
There's no medicine, no pictures... it's weird.
We'll get you something for your stomach.
But first...
Big Tommy.
You really trust him?
Yeah.
We've done a lot of business.
Give him a call.
All right.
I'll get bt's ass on the phone right now.
[ Clicks tongue ]
What are you doing?
Stopping Ray's intestinal issues from derailing the whole investigation.
By making a deal with his friend?
I think I have a way of getting rid of Ray and forcing neal to find his brother.
If he thinks we're really on the run...
It's gonna be hard to keep the whole ruse going out in the real world.
It might be harder stuck in this room.
I promised the brass we'd be in complete control of this situation at all times.
See?
That's why I never make promises.
Big Tommy is all systems go.
This guy gonna show or what?
Big Tommy's nothing if not reliable.
Top dollar, Ray.
No friend discounts, no side deals.
There he is.
Hey, hey.
Relax.
We're not in the prison yard anymore.
We're business partners now, huh?
Right.
Yeah.
And if you come back with a dollar less than we talked about,
I'm gonna have my brother, Dean, run you over in the parking lot.
[ Chuckles ]
[ Clears throat ]
You seeing the blonde?
The one with the glock?
Let's go.
L.A.P.D.!
Put your hands where I can see them!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Put your hands where I can see them!
Ow!
No!
Psst!
Psst!
Get out of here.
You're gonna want to get out of here.
[ Chuckles ] That's sweet of you, Ray.
Oh.
Oh, my stomach hurts.
Take it easy.
Come on, take it easy!
We set up one deal, and the cops bust us?
Screw easy!
They were after big Tommy.
It wasn't even about us.
Ray strike you as the strong, silent type?
H-he's probably trading up everything he knows about us right now to save his own ass.
Your girlfriend's gonna be pissed, huh?
You think?
Dean:
All right.
So, look.
We I... we lay low until we come up with a plan.
Plans take money.
Which, thanks to Ray, we're still short on.
Look, boys.
[ claps hands ]
I think it's time we ended our brief, but deeply meaningful, partnership.
Good luck, huh?
What?
Suddenly you got some place to go?
!
Hey, get your hands off of me!
Back off!
Hey, get your hands off of me!
Stop it, both of you!
Come on, man!
From what I hear, your brother's pretty good at hiding out.
Now, you call him and tell him we need a place to stay.
[ Chuckling ] Why would I do that?
Because we saved your ass...
Twice, and you owe us.
And you know as well as I do your brother's our best chance at staying free.
He's not gonna be easy to find, man.
Then we better get started.
It's goosedown, water resistant.
Real soft...
Go ahead, give it a feel.
You ever been, uh, beach camping?
It's pretty romantic.
Hold on one second.
[ clears throat ]
What's up, neal?
Thought you were in the clink.
Yeah, well, good behavior, man.
Uh-huh.
We need to talk.
In private.
All right.
What do you say we give that thing a test-drive?
Phew!
[ laughs ]
If you broke out, leave now.
I do not need that kind of heat, man, seriously.
We're looking for Kyle.
Has he come to see you lately?
Yeah, I've...
I've seen him.
And if I see him again, he's dead.
Kyle came in here looking for some guns.
Told him, "sure.
Why not?
Just like old times, right?"
Except this time, your douchebag brother decided not to pay me.
He jacked you?
Yeah.
Told me to consider it a donation for the movement.
I fronted for the guns, man.
He put me in a real bad financial situation, 'cause, see, contrary to appearances,
Glenn's big outdoors...
Not doing so great.
Do you know where he is?
No.
And I don't want to know.
Well, if we can find him, we can get your money.
[ Chuckles ]
You don't get it, do you?
I don't want my money.
He's changed, neal.
Okay?
I don't want anything to do with that crazy son of a bitch.
And now that I know what he's planning...
Neither should you.
I think you guys should leave.
[ Footsteps approaching ]
I got your call.
Dean's coming in.
He says they have something on Kyle Erikson.
Did you have ty doing some sort of surveillance in compton?
I did...
A few weeks ago.
Turned out to be a dead end.
What?
Nothing.
[ Door opens ]
Mmm.
Hey, did you run a bg on our man?
Yeah.
Glenn fischer.
He's been picked up a couple of times for buying and selling illegal guns.
Okay, well, Glenn fischer said that Erikson came in recently to buy hardware off him.
Did he say for what?
No, we didn't get that far.
But he did say it was for something big.
Got to give Erikson props...
Shoots an atf Agent and still won't lay low?
Guy's a player.
Haul his ass in.
See if he really knows anything.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wait a minute, now.
I don't know.
Even though Glenn hates Erikson, he's still got that "don't tread on me" attitude.
He may not talk, even if we ask politely.
We still got the same guns as before, so if Glenn's still dealing, we just sell him a couple, pop him.
All right.
Take a run at Glenn with jaimie.
Hey, Dean.
How close is neal to finding his brother?
[ Clicks tongue ] Still working on it.
Can Carter really keep this contained?
100%.
Ty, where the hell are you?
You're gonna be late for your own sting.
Hello.
Welcome to Glenn's big outdoors.
What can I do you for?
Ah...
I need help.
Well, I'm always happy to help a damsel in distress.
Oh.
I need a gun.
What kind of gun?
I don't know.
I was mugged a few months ago.
The guy had a knife, so it shook me up pretty bad.
Yeah, I bet it did.
Were you hurt?
No, but he got my money.
The truth is, I don't like guns, but the police were so freakin' useless.
I know what you mean.
I think I got exactly what you need.
Right here.
Simple.
Reliable.
Yeah.
Whoa.
Wow.
It's heavy.
You've never shot before.
I could show you how.
That'd be great.
Really?
I-I mean...
Cool.
There's one problem.
When I was younger, I got a couple petty thefts, and they were bumped up into felonies.
Is there any way around that?
Anything for you, doll.
This is a gun here that doesn't necessarily need to be registered.
[ Chuckles ]
Well, how much?
Uh...
Make me an offer.
Okay.
Cash only.
Aw, you got to be kidding me.
So, Alex is grilling Glenn.
It turns out he has three weapons charges, so if he knows anything, he's gonna talk.
You didn't have to pull an audible.
I had no choice.
You were late.
I was three minutes late.
A lot can happen in three minutes.
Okay.
I'm sorry, jaimie.
You working surveillance again last night?
Why do you say it like that?
'Cause I talked to Alex.
The surveillance she asked you to do was over two weeks ago.
You checking up on me now?
Don't deflect.
What's up with the girl?
She's having fun, jaimie.
I'm having fun.
No foul, no harm, right?
What you do on your own personal time is your business.
Just don't let it screw up my job.
[ Hard-rock music playing ]
Good time for a drink?
It's always a good time for a drink in this place, man.
[ Chuckles ] Is that neal?
Frankie.
I'm assuming this visit isn't sanctioned by the California department of corrections.
Nope.
This is, uh...
We don't need to use names.
This is a friend of mine.
Friends drink free here.
What kind of bar you running here, Frankie?
It's more like a social club.
Listen, you seen Kyle around?
Has he come by for a drink, maybe some relief?
Baby, it's been a long time since your brother's had to pay for it.
He did call, though, looking for some money.
You got a phone number?
Might not even be good anymore.
You know how cautious he is.
Let's go.
What's the rush?
You boys are welcome to stay.
Everything free for friends?
[ Both laugh ]
Just drinks.
Ah.
We're a little light on cash right now.
Next time.
Hey.
I'm glad you and your brother worked past all that crap.
I didn't really have a choice, did I?
We should gogo back to the hot, call your brother.
This is all I got left.
Pump number three.
Cop:
Excuse me.
Can I help you, officers?
We saw you across the street.
You know you have a broken taillight?
Uh, I'll get that fixed right away.
Sorry about that.
Can I see your license and registration?
Listen, I'm a cop.
Lieutenant Carter Shaw.
L.A.P.D.
I'm in the middle of an undercover case.
I need you to get back in your patrol unit and drive away.
[ Chuckles ] You got to do better than that, buddy.
Call it in now...
L.A.P.D. Or FBI.
Ask for Agent Alex rice.
So now you're a fed.
Where's your junior g-man badge, then?
Listen, don't ruin your careers over this, guys.
All right, secret Agent man, step back.
[ Grunts ]
Neal:
Get down on the ground, man.
Get his gun.
[ Laughs ]
Let's go.
How you like me now, bitch?
I said, "let's go."
What are you gonna do, man?
You gonna shoot me over this pig?
Kill you or go down for killing a cop?
Easy choice.
Yeah.
[ Laughs ]
Nice!
Hey.
What's up?
Just checking in.
See if you were planning on shooting any old ladies or puppies after jacking those two cops.
[ Sighs ] Yeah.
Well, you see, the thing about that was...
Do you have any idea how big of a deal that was?
I had it under control, Alex.
You let a convicted felon put a gun on an officer.
We got a phone number for Kyle Erikson.
Neal andean are upstairs right now waiting for a callback.
We're close to getting Erikson.
Come on.
I got this.
I should pull you for being such a pain in the ass.
Why don't you put that in my evaluation report?
[ Sighs ] It's been a whole day.
Your brother gonna call or what?
If it's his number, he'll call.
That bartender said something about you getting over something with Kyle.
What'd she mean?
[ Chuckling ] Man, w-what did you do, watch some kind of self-help tv while I was taking a leak?
[ Chuckles ]
I just want to know if you can deliver on this.
If you can't, then no offense, but you can go to hell.
I was doing time in chino for something Kyle did.
You took the rap for him?
Yeah.
Him and one of his dumb militia men, Reese, knocked over a jewelry store in Portland.
The feds caught up with Reese, and he told them it was me he hit that store with, not Kyle.
He told him to say that?
Why the hell would you go along with something like that?
'Cause he'd do the same for me.
You sure about that?
[ Telephone ringing ]
[ Sighs ] Hello?
Yeah.
It's been a long time, Kyle.
Long time.
[ Sighs ]
Good news...
Kyle Erikson called back.
He agreed to hide us.
Where is he?
I didn't speak to him directly.
Neal arranged it.
We're supposed to meet him downtown at midnight.
Good.
That's when we'll take him.
Jaimie and ty find out what Erikson's big plan is from Glenn?
All Glenn said is that Erikson was planning on assassinating someone.
We had to cut him loose after that.
He give you a name?
No, but he did say it was gonna be a political statement.
We're checking to see if there's anyone that Erikson has a grudge with.
A political statement doesn't have to be personal.
Just has to be big.
He'll be looking to hit someone who will get him some press.
We'll bust Erikson tonight and find out who he's targeting.
Or...
We don't take him tonight.
I could stay under and find out who he's targeting from the inside.
No.
What do you mean, "no"?
Why the hell not?
This is coming from my boss.
I told him we didn't have an exact I.D. On Erikson's target.
[ Sighs ]
He said if we have a chance to take Erikson, we take him.
Deal with the assassination later.
Busting him doesn't mean we'll stop the hit.
I mean, Erikson may be a megalomaniac, but he's not dumb.
He'll probably send one of his little disciples to do it.
That's your opinion.
I'm just doing what's best for this case.
Good.
The case is Kyle Erikson.
We're taking him tonight.
There they are.
What are we looking for?
I don't know.
He just said meet him here, midnight.
Wait.
That's him.
Did you see them?
See who?
Back there.
The truck.
I didn't see anything.
They're there.
Trust me.
Okay.
What do you want to do?
[ Engine turns over ]
Looks like they're loading into Erikson's van.
Get ready.
[ Guns cock ]
[ Tires screeching ]
Get out of the van.
What the hell are you doing?
Is there some kind of asshole pill they give you guys at the academy?
I gave you and Carter exact orders.
He snuck a cellphone in.
He'll call as soon as he figures out who Erikson's targeting, okay?
What if Erikson finds the cellphone on him?
What if they decide they just don't want Carter around anymore and shoot him?
!
He'll call.
Get with ty and jaimie and check out the van.
See if there's anything you can get off it about where they might have taken Carter.
Okay.
You know, he's just doing what's best for the case.
I'm getting tired of hearing that.
Slick move with your brother...
Sending him out as a decoy.
Any idea how they were on to you?
I was about to ask you the same thing.
[ Gun cocks ]
That's len...
Man of few words.
He's a good soldier.
No idea why the cops were there?
All I know is that I busted neal out, and I kept his ass safe, and then I gave up my brother so you could get away.
That's what I know.
Len Get our guest some coffee.
[ Laughter ]
Huh?
Neal's always stepping in it.
Even when we were kids, needed someone to show him the way.
If I hadn't hired a girl to bust his cherry,
I think he'd still be a virgin.
[ Laughs ]
Ah.
That's, uh, Wendy.
That's grace.
Come on, girls.
Show Mr. pine some hospitality.
[ Zipper opens ]
If I knew this is what you militia guys did,
I would have joined up years ago.
Mm-hmm.
[ laughs ]
We have restrictions, of course.
Of course.
I think my brother would like some company.
[ Chuckles ]
Mmm.
Enjoy yourself.
Did you miss me?
Mm-hmm.
Hmm?
[ Laughs ]
Anything off the van?
Jaimie:
No.
Looks like Erikson stole it out of tarzana yesterday.
Ty and Dean are trying to run it down, but...
[ Cellphone rings ]
Carter?
Sorry.
Tell him I'll call him back.
You're really worried.
Erikson's a big case.
I mean about Carter.
Yeah, well, aren't you?
Mm-hmm.
Take it easy on the bear.
[ Door opens ]
Kyle:
I know we planned this for later, but what with my brother showing up, people might be looking for him.
Don't know how much longer we'll be safe here.
It's our chance to make history.
One bullet in washburn...
Will change everything.
Be another shot heard 'round the world.
They'll write poems about it.
I know I can count on you.
[ Gun cocks ]
[ Cellphone rings ]
Rice.
It Carter.
Where are you?
Erikson's looking to kill someone named washburn.
Federal courthouse.
Look for, uh, prosecutors, judges... something like that.
Okay, uh, there's a federal judge named washburn.
Looks like he ruled a big case against some of these militia types last year.
That's got to be it.
Find him.
This is officer jaimie Allen with the l.A.P.D.
I need to speak with judge washburn.
Where are you?
Erikson's not making the hit himself.
He sent someone else...
A kid, maybe 24, thin, black hair, crew cut.
We'll get to washburn, Carter.
Alex, he already sent him.
You have to move now.
No one can get him on his cell.
He's due in court right now.
We have to get to him first.
Carter, where the hell are you?
Put down the damn phone.
Carter's cover's blown.
Let's get to the judge.
What about Carter?
There's no time.
Call ty and Dean.
What the hell are you doing?
I'm a cop, neal.
[ Laughs ]
Damn.
I did not see that coming.
Put the gun down.
[ Laughing ] Why?
Why would I do that?
Because your brother is about to execute a federal judge, and no matter what happens, you'll be an accomplice.
You already took the fall for him once, neal.
Don't do it again.
So, what?
You gonna help me...
Is that it?
... if I cooperate?
Please.
Kyle!
Get in here!
[ Grunting ]
What the hell is this?
He's a cop.
Drop your gun, Kyle.
Kyle, don't.
I can't believe he shot me.
There he is.
[ Beeping ]
Judge.
L.A.P.D. Judge washburn.
Cop:
Hey!
I'm special Agent Alex rice, FBI.
L.A.P.D.
Cop:
Put your guns down!
L.A.P.D. FBI.
There's been a threat made on your life.
Cop:
Put your guns down!
Gun!
[ Len grunting ]
Drop it.
Drop it!
[ Grunts ]
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah.
Ah-ah.
Ah. [ sighs ]
I surrender.
You killed your brother just to try to get away?
What are little brothers for?
You're sick.
Aah!
[ Cellphone rings ]
[ Breathing heavily ]
Hey.
Yeah, I'm fine.
Yeah.
Good.
Good.
All right, I'll see you later.
I will be a national hero for what I did today, even in jail.
Don't start writing your memoirs just yet.
They stopped crew cut and your girlfriend before they could get to judge washburn.
You're a joke.
[ Grunts ]
Gah!
That was some old-school undercover, lieutenant.
Great job.
I wish I was under with laker girls, but we worked it out.
[ Chuckles ]
Where you going?
Good job today.
I didn't even see her coming.
[ Sighs ] Well, you got the primary suspect.
I just got lucky.
Nah.
You're good.
I wasn't judging your night life.
I just want to do a good job.
You probably think I'm an asshole that I split up with Mel, huh?
No.
I get it.
Really?
Our jobs are great.
Just not a lot of room for other people.
Maybe in the long run, you did her a favor, huh?
[ Chuckles ]
Good night.
Mmm.
He good?
Mm-hmm.
Hungry?
No, I ate.
Sex?
[ Sighs ] Nice try.
How about a beer?
Sure.
So...
[ sighs ] ...Your bosses must be happy.
Got Kyle Erikson, saved a life.
They're happy about the bust.
But when the bureau gives you an order, you're expected to follow it, so I guess I won't be getting a gold star on my evaluation.
You know I really don't care what you write about m.
I think you care that we're sleeping together, we work together, and I get to tell people what I really think about you.
[ Scoffs ] Well, when you put it like that.
All right.
Let's make it even.
Give me an honest evaluation.
Really?
Special Agent Alex rice exhibits sharp tactical skills, good leadership qualities...
I like it so far.
...But lacks creativity and can be inflexible.
"Inflexible."
Just being honest.
So am I.
Okay.
Finally.
[ Chuckles ]
"Though lieutenant Shaw's unorthodox methods
"often yield results,
"he's chronically belligerent,
"disdainful of authority, independently minded to the point of narcissistic."
"Belligerent," "disdainful," "narcissistic"?
Just add "opinionated" and "charmless,"
and I think you nailed it.
[ Laughs ]
It's a joke, Carter.
I can't show you the real report.
You look like you could use a steak and a couple Martinis, on me.
If it's on you.
[ chuckles ]
You know, um, "belligerent," "narcissistic"
just seem just a little strong.
Yeah.
Just wait till you try and get me in bed tonight.
I'll show you inflexible.
Come on, I was joking too.
[ Chuckles ]
We've been paid!
-All this is ours?
-Yes.
First Switzerland, Paris and then the whole world.
This is only the beginning.
Now that you're going to be businessmen and all that.
I don't know.
I could make you some suits.
Almudena Lobo, will you marry me?
Yes.
I can't breathe.
What's going on here?
I still don't know.
Does this have anything to do with her tuberculosis?
Your sister, she's... dying.
Don't tell me this is just indigestion.
Rosa could have infected you.
-Leave me alone.
What have you done, child?
What?
.
-What?
You're pregnant.
Well!
You only work for whores and those bastards.
Get out of my store right now!
What do you mean you're leaving?
Almudena and I are getting married.
I need you to bring this letter to Cesar.
"He's waiting for me to elope, but I can't leave Rosa now".
Nieves is not sick.
She's pregnant.
You wouldn't have anything to do with that, would you?
Spread your legs.
What are you doing?
Let's go.
I didn't have it removed.
I have something for you.
If my daughter dies Felix, I swear to god I will kill you.
"Where the hell is your son?"
I'm going to die.
Don't talk nonsense.
Translated by Ugetwhatugive.
Good evening, father.
-Good evening, Sebastian.
Open up.
Come on!
(Neighing)
Anibal.
The priest has arrived.
Peace to this house.
-And to all who inhabit it.
Rosa.
Kiss the cross.
Are these the last rites?
Am I going to die now?
Purify me Lord.
With hyssop, I will be clean.
Cleanse me and I shall be whiter than snow.
Our help...
"...is in the hands of the Lord"
"Lord, come into this house eternal happiness..."
Any news of Felix?
They're still looking, sir.
Find him wherever he is.
Spare no means.
Anibal.
"Forever and ever" -"Amen"
Bring him alive.
I want to be the one to deal with him.
You can't be here.
The house is full.
You didn't come.
The letter Isabel gave you wasn't mine.
I just want to leave with you.
Well, let's go.
No.
My sister Rosa is very ill.
I can't leave now.
Is that the real reason?
It doesn't have anything to do with the wedding?
Felix ran away.
That coward...
Rosa's dying because of him.
If there's anything I can do...
Can you wait for me?
(Door opens)
They loved it.
I knew it.
So the Swiss are really going to drink this?
They want us to sell them 4000 liters per month.
How much are they paying?
-Let's see.
5 cents a liter, 200 pesetas a month.
And next year we'll renegotiate.
Give me that.
Moorish king.
Come over here.
Impressive, huh?
Nobody believed in their water, and they're going to get rich.
Just one thing.
How much do you get from this?
Let's see, a fixed 20 pesetas plus 0.5 percent almost 25 pesetas a month.
Man!
And you won't celebrate it?
-That's true.
What are you celebrating?
That they're robbing you?
Nobody is robbing me.
I charge for doing my job.
The spring belongs to them.
Of course.
That's life.
You make them rich.
You come up with the idea, and what do you get?
25 pesetas.
A handout?
I see it this way.
There's two halves here.
The strength and the land...
in other words, the Bravos and the intelligence.
In other words, me.
And you.
Man!
Not about men, Jean Marie.
This is plundering.
You demand a share, or backpack and take a hike.
"Help me, Roman"
"Okay"
Anibal, madman.
Anyone could see us.
No.
Are you dying to kiss me that bad?
You and him.
It's a boy.
(Door opens)
Mr. Sagasta has sent notice to come and visit you.
He's worried about you.
Tata, brush my hair.
What if I if I go through with...?
And Anibal acknowledges it.
What do you think my father would do?
What do you think?
Father is a practical man.
If everything is done, what can he do?
Nieves.
If you're thinking of having that baby with Anibal, you should put land in between.
Lots of it.
Elena!
Elena!
Hello.
I come for the suits.
We want you to make more, and better.
The suits aren't ready.
I'll come later or tomorrow.
No, they still won't be ready.
Has something happened?
No.
It's just that I can't make them.
I make adjustments, but I've realized that a tailored suit is too complicated for me.
I'll give you your money back from the advance and I'm sorry.
They found out, didn't they?
It was Sebastian, he ripped them.
Shit!
I'm sorry if I got you into trouble.
At least let me pay for the fabrics.
-No.
Lobo paid for them.
But I can't make any more...
-I see.
I'm sorry, and I understand.
No, relax, it was my idea.
You're not going to do anything about it either?
Listen, Miguel.
Perhaps I'd make it worse.
-Don't meddle in adult matters.
You'll let them do what they want, right?
If father was here, he would've beaten up Sebastian.
No, Miguel.
Well...
I'm leaving.
Son.
Your father never hit anyone.
He was a coward?
-Of course not, sweetie.
He was very brave.
The bravest man I've ever known.
But he did not believe in guns or fists.
Lucky he didn't live in Tierra de Lobos.
If we hear anything about Felix, we'll let you know.
Give Mr. Lobo and his daughters our concern for Rosa.
They'll appreciate it.
How is my son?
Does he need anything?
He's perfectly fine.
We have everything in Casa Grande.
Don't worry, I'll keep an eye on him.
Thank you.
Herminia.
Who sells the house of the former doctor?
The corporal's son-in-law..
Will you live on your own?
Did you find yourself a girlfriend?
I'm glad.
A mayor is not to mediate conflicts of boundaries.
Nor...
Nor is this the right place.
However, with a contribution to City Hall, I can make an exception.
Excuse me, I have urgent business to discuss with the mayor.
Come back later.
What do you want?
We are very concerned about your son.
How dare you interrupt me?
It's important for Mr. Lobo that we find him soon.
His daughter is very sick.
Tell your master, that he should keep me happy.
Where is your son?
I have nothing to say to you.
Where.
Is.
Your son?
Ah!
You're not understanding the urgency of this matter.
Ah, ah!
Your son!
I don't know.
I don't know.
I swear.
I swear.
With any...
Any news.
Come see me.
Ah!
For the inconvenience.
We must leave this instant, to the railroad.
We leave in a few hours.
It's urgent!
I'll pay you extra.
The horses are tired.
They'll rest halfway there.
We must leave now.
I'll help you out, Professor.
What are you doing here, fool?
Wait, Professor.
You don't know what you've done.
You don't know the trouble you've caused me.
We must leave town, right now.
Don't be afraid.
Asking for what's ours, is the will of God.
-What is ours?
I'm not so sure, Lola.
Come guys, let's eat!
Roman, help me.
-I can't.
Come on, Roman.
-Wait, it's coming out!
Come on, it's time to eat.
Jean Marie has something to tell you.
What?
The wood you requested won't stop breaking and the water is leaking everywhere.
Well, it's actually about a different matter.
Something about...
another aspect.
Come on.
Lend a hand.
I'm fortunate to have met you.
To the point.
This business of ours is a very complex one.
Everyone does what he can .
I think that my part should be acknowledged.
Let's see, what do you want?
What I want to say is...
He wants some of the benefits.
Come on, we have work to do.
What do you want?
Nothing.
They'll pay for this rudeness, or my name isn't Angustias de la Merced.
I swear it.
(Laughing)
"If you don't mind, wait here a moment"
How dare you come into this house?
Sir, the doctor is here!
I can walk, Anibal.
Lovely, the people of this town.
How did you find this rat?
He came by himself.
How is Rosa?
Dying, because of you.
I think she can be saved.
You said that already.
-I didn't say anything.
And I've made a horrible trip through preposterous lands only to see the girl.
So please, show me the way.
- Who the hell are you?
There is no need to shout.
I can hear perfectly well.
I advise you to chew mint leaves.
He is Doctor Zurita, my Professor.
One of the most respected physicians in Europe.
He's the only one who can save Rosa.
If we're going to argue while the girl is dying why don't they pour us a drink?
Come on.
Well.
Just when I get to sit down.
Shit!
You nailed it.
What are you doing here, kid?
Show me.
Go on, Miguel.
Go with your mother.
There's too much to chop.
I want to learn how to throw the knife, and fight...
Go home.
If they see you here, it will cause a problem.
No, I want to be like you.
Miguelito, you're just a kid.
-Ok.
But my grandfather is old and my mom is a girl.
I have to be the man of the house.
If not, who's going to protect my family?
Felix.
You came back.
Thank god.
-You didn't tell me enough.
This girl is a corpse.
For god's sake, open the windows.
Let the sunshine and the air in.
Who is this gentleman?
-Quiet, girl.
You should only speak to adults when spoken to.
Don't talk to my daughter like that again.
Who's useless in this room?
You or me?
Hopefully it's me because it stinks.
Please.
There is no one in Spain better than him.
No one.
Please.
You really wish to live with such a father?
You are worse.
Could be.
I bet you like Felix more.
But I bet he didn't ask you if you cough up liquid blood or lumpy?
May I see your handkerchief?
Thank you.
I'll see where it hurts.
Ouch!
Relax, relax.
He is more handsome and nicer.
But I am smarter.
Huh?
(Roar)
(Roar)
Meat for the wolves, kid.
That's what's written on your forehead.
-Shit!
There's two kind of people in life.
The hunters and the prey.
Right now, you're the prey.
And what do I have to do to be a hunter?
Hold this.
First you must observe and be invisible.
You have to blend in with the forest.
And take advantage of every opportunity.
What opportunities?
Look, this one didn't have as good a teacher as you do.
Teach me the knife throw.
Please, please.
Teach me, please.
(Door)
Cesar, do you have a minute?
One.
Better.
It's the contract with the Swiss.
You have to sign.
Let's see.
All of the pages, huh?
I feel like I'm selling my soul to the devil.
Heh.
You have to read what you sign.
Is everything alright?
(Stutters) It's alright.
It's exquisite.
Back to work.
Ah, Jean Marie.
-What?
Nothing.
If you've seen the tobacco.
"I Cesar Bravo, hereby yield a third of the estate La Quebrada and it's exploitations to Jean Marie Ramon".
No, not Ramon.
Raymond.
Justice has been served.
I didn't believe in hell, Lola.
But I've seen it.
And you and I are there...
in a pot.
Two people were cooking us.
It's very hot.
It will be less hot when we have a legion of slaves fanning us.
You know that I don't do favors.
This will be very expensive.
That doesn't matter.
Just save the girl.
We have to operate.
Stop the nonsense.
Since when can tuberculosis be operated on?
Your son-in-law has her tuberculosis under control already.
And remarkably well.
Alright.
What's wrong then?
Her appendix is inflamed.
And it's about to explode.
The appendix is a tag-line of the digestive system.
What can be done?
We open her up cut it out... and throw it to the dogs.
Actually, no.
We better keep it in alcohol.
I want to show one to my students.
And then?
And then, nothing.
Can you tell me of any known function of the appendix?
Me neither.
The appendix is the only organ that is clearly useless.
With the exception of a few people's brains.
We'll operate at midnight.
The girl must remain fasting, until then.
Not me.
I will eat dinner an hour beforehand.
Something simple, that they can't ruin.
Doctor.
Is it a complicated surgery?
I don't know.
I've never done it, neither I nor anyone in Spain.
If that moron doesn't save my daughter...
-I know.
I know.
Feel the shot.
Feel the shot.
Feel the shot.
Feel the shot.
I nailed it!
Child of the devil!
Stop or it will be worse!
I'll stop if you don't hit me.
-I'm going to pound you!
What's happening?
This boy, has gotten stupid!
He threw a knife.
What?
One day there may be a tragedy!
Listen, mother.
One has to choose if they want to be hunter or prey.
(Bells chiming)
Everyone thought that I had fled.
You didn't say where you were going.
And what do you think your father would have said, if I had consulted him about it?
It was hard for me to come back.
I know what is at stake.
I did it for Rosa.
But, above all, I did it for you.
What's wrong?
Wait a minute.
Hello.
You didn't have to make up so many lies.
What now?
Come on, deal the cards.
Thanks a lot, gorgeous.
I'll put it on your tab.
You know?
Lobo has left me very lonely lately.
That Lobo!
In the end I'll have to take care of his affairs.
Come on, go.
Want me to win again or what?
Well!
What are you doing here?
That's for being a moron!
How dare you take a ten year old boy hunting?
What a bigmouth!
Hey, I just wanted to make him a man.
If you try that again, I'll make sure you cease to be one.
Stay away from my son, got it?
Understood?
What?
Your son will never become a man this way.
-I know how to educate my son.
Oh, yeah?
I hunted wolves at his age.
And look where you are.
Handsome!
Come on, since you're bathed, I'll give you a discount.
I'm going to see my sisters.
Almudena, aren't you going to explain to me about that man?
Nothing happened.
Do I really deserve that you lie to me this way?
Felix, think about my sister right now.
I want the truth.
I met him before we were engaged.
I tried to forget him but...
I couldn't.
And I won't be able to.
Have you been with him?
Have you been with him?
I was going to run away with him.
I didn't do it because of Rosa.
I don't want to lie and say it was because of you.
Ready for surgery?
A beautiful woman.
Now I see why you remain in this infectious town.
Good afternoon.
Ma'am!
What's that lady's name?
Mrs housekeeper, ma'am!
Doctor.
First, wash your hands.
Washing is not putting your hands in water.
It's rubbing.
-Don't worry.
Bring me some boiling water and throw in these tools.
Yes, sir.
Bring a bowl with hot water clean clothes, and 3 glasses with three parts anise and two of cognac.
The liquor is for me.
(Howling)
Have you checked that she hasn't eaten anything?
Felix!
Yes, sir, she's in fasting.
This town has a stupefying effect.
I should study it.
I'm afraid.
I would be too if I were you.
Will you be here?
Yes.
Of course he'll be here.
But I'm the one who's saving your life.
This is my friend.
It will make the pain go away.
It's better than this, but more expensive.
So, when you wake up, don't ask me for more.
May I?
Yes, of course.
Don't worry about anything.
Now count with me, to ten.
One.
One.
Two.
-Two.
Three.
Three.
Four.
-Four.
Five.
-Fi...
We've missed you, Lola.
Hands off, greedy, I come as a client.
Come on, Jean Mari.
Let's celebrate, that we're "owners"
Above all, celebrate!
That's too much.
The Bravos have been very kind to us.
Let's see...
aren't you French?
No, I'm not French.
I'm a Swiss citizen, from Switzerland.
From Switzerland, from France...
Who cares!
Didn't you cut the heads off the rich to share the cake?
The Revolution!
The Revolution, that's it.
But the Bravos have been lucky.
And we have left their heads in place.
That's one way to look at it.
To St. Jean of the homeland.
And yay!
"Ole", Jean Marie.
Fifth sorrowful mystery.
-Death of our Lord.
Our father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
Thy kingdom come thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
The sting of the devil.
Your sister's was full of poison.
Everything went well.
-Yes, but will she live?
She was very weak and this kind of surgery hasn't been well rehearsed.
If she survives the night, she will live.
Pray that it will be so.
(All drunk) "Allons, enfants de la Patrie, Ie jour de glorie est arrive!".
"Contre nous, de la tyrannie...".
Look.
She looks like the Madeleine!
-The who?
The Freedom of Delacroix.
Wait!
Take one breast out, come on.
What a beast!
What a Valkyrie!
She has the strength of a man.
There's no need to exaggerate.
I bet you anything, at an arm wrestle.
Oh!
How can I bet?
She's a lady.
Bah!
"D'accord".
"D'accord".
Let's bet a few drinks.
Well!
Someone is going down hill.
We'll bet our share of La Quebrada.
Yes, that's it.
La Quebrada.
Well...
Against this account.
Eh?
Come on.
If you want to invite...
I accept the gift.
Never underestimate an opponent.
On one on two, and on three.
Come on, Victoria!
Come on, come on!
Come on!
Victoria!
-Come on!
Victoria, you have him!
Prove that you're a man.
I'm a gentleman.
If you wish, we can cancel the bet.
No, thanks.
Come on, Victoria!
Come on, come on!
-Now, Victoria!
Let's go, Victoria!
-Come on, come on!
You got him, come on!
Come on, Victoria!
Jean Marie!
Come on, come on!
You can do it!
Yay!
Can I get a rematch, please?
Is she ok?
Yes.
Where are you going?
I'll be right back.
(Whispers) Anibal.
(Hammering)
(Hammering)
It's a...
I know what it is.
Okay.
Surely, in Paris, they make better cribs.
Surely.
Anibal, I'm afraid.
For Rosa?
For everything.
Cheating.
That's cheating.
It's cheating!
What a night!
Did you do a lot of crazy things?
-Poor guy!
He's an angel.
(Throws up)
Well, he did have a few drinks.
And they disagreed with him.
Cesar.
I need to talk to you.
Juan Marie.
Sweetheart.
It's too early.
Don't be so official, we just woke up.
It's about yesterday, right?
About your share of the business.
-You know?
Yes.
Your girlfriend and I were talking and you're right.
You deserve it
No.
We'll give you a share.
No, really, no.
Jean Marie, be grateful and say thank you.
It's just that I I don't deserve it.
If you only knew that last night...
-Uh and he's overwhelmed.
The French are so frail.
Jean Marie, you've worked hard on this.
You deserve it.
Huh?
Now that we're partners, squeeze that drunken head of yours and see if you can get more money from the Swiss.
They were going to give it to me.
They were going to give it to me.
How could I do this to them?
They're such great people!
Great-great.
Until they find out that yesterday you lost a part of their business.
They wouldn't kill us.
Right?
(Gags)
How do you feel?
Bad.
Bad bad... ..or normal bad?
Normal bad.
That's about right.
Let's see.
(Door opens)
She survived the night.
It seems that everything went well.
Felix.
My daughters are the most valuable thing I have.
I put two in your hands and you didn't fail me.
I've only done my job.
I want you to know that you can count on me.
Take care of him.
He's worth much more than it seemed.
"Hello, princess".
Thank you, Felix.
What you've done for us...
She's alive?
Well, help me get out of this horrible place.
Doctor.
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
Trust me.
If a woman hits you like that, she's in love.
Are you sure?
No.
Maybe she's also pissed off.
I don't understand women.
Wait.
Leave the money there.
Come on.
Go.
Alright.
But don't let me do it twice, Cesar's at the well and he'll kill me.
Get out of there!
Come on!
Let's go!
Come on!
Miguel!
Damn child!
What are you doing?
How did this boy get in here?
Bring me something to clean his wound.
Miguel, you can't go around spying on people.
It's creepy.
I wanted to know what you come here for.
People come here to...
take a nap.
Why do you take so many naps?
I know you don't have a father, but I'm not a good role model.
Why not?
Because no, no, no.
Because I... besides...
For example...
Your mother is right, you're just a kid.
Come on, go on, let's go.
(Galloping)
(Neighing)
What do you want, doctor?
To challenge you to a duel.
To the death.
I don't accept.
If you're a man, you'll give me a chance to mend my honor.
Then, I'm not a man.
No.
Come on, Miguelito, damn it, I'm in a hurry, and you're too slow.
Elena.
What's wrong, son?
Are you ok?
It's just a scratch.
Hunting.
-No.
It was at the house of...
-It was with me.
Playing.
I was too rough!
You're grounded.
And you're sweeping today.
But...
-Shhh!
I thought I made myself very clear.
But, of course...
Since I'm the only one around here who asks you nicely.
Seriously, it's not me, it's him.
He's stuck to me like a shadow.
I don't know what's going on with this boy.
Well, he doesn't have a father.
I understand him.
The same thing happened to me.
I was always stuck to Cesar.
I still am.
And...
Have you thought about getting married again?
Marry who?
You?
Well.
You're still beautiful.
Still?
Thanks.
I guess that was meant to be a compliment.
Yes, yes, no, of course, yes.
What I meant to say is okay?
It's that...
Quiet, quiet.
And let me take a look at your eye.
Ah!
Don't be silly.
There are places that mark the decline of a great man.
This is my Waterloo.
Let me do the talking.
Hey, buster.
We came to buy back our share of La Quebrada.
I don't want it.
Still, I lost an honest bet and I'd like to reward you.
Let's sit down, please.
Well I've been talking to Mr Lobo.
He offered me 500 pesetas.
But you can't sell it to Mr. Lobo.
It would be the end of the Bravos.
I'm dead.
And I deserve it.
It's yours for 501.
200 pesetas.
You can get almost 500 for this alone.
German optics.
Another 200.
My collection of fossils.
Quite complete, eh?
And look.
Mummy dust.
One peseta.
Only 100 left to go.
Jean Marie, the watch.
-Huh?
The watch.
No, no!
No, no, no, no!
It was my grandfather's watch.
Always carried by the firstborn without ever letting it stop.
Mmm!
The needles are made of gold?
"Oui".
I like it.
Didn't you have a cameo?
No...
It has a picture of my little angels, and I can't take it out.
You have children?
I haven't seen them in a long time.
It's ok.
Lobo will arrive in a while.
The cameo, the cameo!
What a wretched woman!
Felix knows it.
About Cesar, he knows.
But how?
He saw us, and I told him.
How could you tell him?
I couldn't lie to him.
He doesn't deserve it.
What will you do?
Cesar thinks I lied to him, and that Rosa was an excuse.
So, I don't know.
And you?
The old man is so old.
I can't recognize you.
But I love it.
For once you follow your heart, and not that twisted mind of yours.
I don't follow it.
You'll be happy with Anibal.
He adores you, and you love him since always.
But...
-Even if you insist on pretending that it's just a whim.
And life here, in the countryside once you have kids running around...
What I wouldn't give to have a life like that with Cesar!
Don't worry about money.
You'll do fine.
We will help you.
And maybe father, someday...
Someday.
(Horse snorts)
(Neighing)
Giddy-up!
Cesar Bravo!
I challenge you to a duel to the death.
Accept.
I will kill you anyway.
Coward!
Don't make me explain the reasons for which I demand amends.
Set the time.
-Tomorrow.
At sunset.
Mom, remember the peach cake you used to make for me in Madrid?
Of course, you loved it.
Roman only eats bread in the mornings, poor guy.
If he lived here, no one would bother us.
How can he live here?
He has his own house.
Grandpa always says that you need a man.
And Roman is always looking for women.
Honey, the women Roman looks for don't...
What am I trying to explain this nonsense for?
Why not?
I like him.
Of course you like him.
You're a kid, and he's another.
And worse than you.
Get that idea out of your head.
Roman is a kid to me.
Well, I think he likes you.
Honey.
Look, I...
I know that you miss...
Well, I'm not a guy.
I can't do what a father does.
And grandpa can't either...
You can ask me whatever you want.
You know what would make the cake really good?
Cherries.
And we have cherries, right?
.
Giddy-up!
Yah!
Yah!
Come on!
Aaaah!
In front of everyone, in the street.
Intolerable.
Absolutely intolerable.
Looking for me?
What the hell happened between you and Cesar?
He insulted my mother.
Don't make me go into details.
That rabble!
Your mother, may she rest in peace, was an extraordinary woman.
But Felix.
Your life is worth more that that hoodlum's.
You can't risk it.
I will kill him.
Don't worry.
I can't allow that duel.
It's against the law.
The customary law also applies.
-Not in this town.
I will prevent that duel with my men.
And if I can't, the one who survives, will die in jail.
You said I had your trust.
This is the time to prove it.
Of course you have it.
And I assure you that we'll finish that bastard.
Right, Anibal?
It must be me!
Felix, the law is above all.
Doctor!
Have you thought it through, about your duel?
How must I say it?
Yes.
I'll set a new time.
No one else will know.
Why would you do that?
-If it were me, I would demand amends too.
Set it earlier.
Tomorrow at dawn.
At La Quebrada.
(Cries)
Come on in.
Made you feel sorry, right?
Poor man!
It broke my heart.
We should've let him keep the watch.
-Well, yes.
Let's divvy up.
He says these things are worth a lot.
Well, keep them.
I'll keep the money.
I'll see how I can sell them.
The devices.
Not the watch.
So your conscience won't hurt you.
Don't worry, I'll be fine.
You keep the cameo, with the pictures of your kids.
What kids?
Did he say anything else?
Nothing.
Tomorrow, at dawn.
You can still cancel it.
You too?
You assume that he will kill me?
He's a good shot, I can assure you.
You should practice if you wanna stand a chance.
If you don't shoot first you're dead.
With this type of weapon, position is essential.
Expose the minimum surface.
And protect your head with your arm.
Is that clear?
Why doesn't anyone believe in me?
I'm going to kill that man.
(Footsteps)
Jean Marie, give me a pen and paper.
Hello.
It's absurd.
You never know what can happen.
Have you seen what a snob he is?
You'll leave him full of holes before he aims.
I leave all my assets to my brother Roman Bravo.
Except a tenth part of La Quebrada to my friend Jean Marie...
How is that Surname?
Raymond.
R.
A.
Y.
M.
O.
N. D.
As promised.
If something happens to me, it's better that you're together.
Hey, there's nothing for me?
You are the executor, and they can't be in it.
How much does an executor charge?
Here, take this.
A bird in hand is worth two in the bush.
Roman.
Come with me.
I need to ask you something.
You're very annoying.
Very annoying.
Come!
He left me a part of La Quebrada.
Because he knows that he'll kill the doctor.
God!
Nieves!
What happened to you?
The horse threw me.
Tata!
Tata!
What happened?
God!
Come on.
Let's get out of here, come on.
No one must see you this way.
Leave us, Anibal.
Can I take this away, sir?
Thank you.
I'm sorry, Miss Nieves isn't home at this time.
I'll come back later.
Let her know I was here.
Don't worry.
I'll let her know.
(Shoots)
(Shoots)
Bury it.
He had a broken leg.
What do you want?
I didn't know Felix would return.
Well!
I didn't mean to cause your marriage so many problems.
Don't kill him.
I've done all I can to prevent the duel.
You know how to shoot.
He can't defend himself.
He's blinded by rage.
It isn't fair.
Is that all you care about?
No.
But he saved my sister.
I'm glad.
But I can't help you.
Leave.
Do whatever it takes.
But don't kill him.
Quickly, I want to go back to sleep.
Relax.
Don't look at me like that, It'll give me a bad feeling.
Ready?
Positions.
Count.
Load your weapons, gentlemen.
Up to ten.
One.
Two.
Three.
Four.
Five.
Six.
Seven.
Eight.
Nine.
Ten.
-No!
(Shoots)
The gang of the Santo is wanted for murder.
Would you prefer that I had died?
Rosario.
He's back, I saw him.
We have to make a trap between all of us.
That way it will be ready for tonight.
Don't touch me.
You will marry Almudena like it or not.
Take me, do to me whatever you want.
I love another man.
Why doesn't he show his face?
-If Isee him, I'll shoot first and ask later.
Have you told anyone that we are fugitives?
I want you to do something for me.
Promise me that you will never leave us.
Don't move.
You will remain locked up in here until your wedding day.
Bang.
(Shouts)
Drop the gun.
And what will you do?
Face the entire town?
You'll be the first.
Enough!
The Bravos are back?
Now we're all going to die.
Louie, Louie, Louie, Louie
Louie, Louie, Louie, Lou-ah
Louie, Louie, Louie, Louie
Louie, Louie, you're gonna cry
Louie, Louie, Louie, Louie
Louie, Louie, Louie, Lou-ah
Louie, Louie, Louie, Louie
Louie, Louie, you're gonna die
Louie, Louie, Louie, Louie
Thank you.
Thank you, everybody.
Nice to be here.
I feel pretty good today.
You know why I feel good?
Because I...
Finally, I have the body that I want and that's a thing people really covet.
It's a hard thing to achieve, and I did.
And I'm gonna tell you how to have exactly the body that you want.
You just have to want a shitty body.
That's all it is.
You have to want your own shitty, ugly, disgusting body.
I don't, though, like being uncomfortable and unealthy and I'm both of those things all the time.
I get really sweaty all the time.
L...
And that's also bad for sex, because I just sweat...
I just rain sweat all over people.
Like, I'm like, uhhh.
And that's what I'm like when I have sex.
I go, uhhh.
And I always see her, and she's like, just:
Just sweat is pouring off my head.
And she's like, "Dude, you're limiting my enjoyment by a lot. "
No.
Well, then you can call for an appointment.
The results from that test don't come in until tomorrow.
No, I have no way of knowing the results before they get here.
Yes?
I'm here to see Ben, Dr. Mitchell.
Okay, what time is your appointment and what is your name?
My name's Louie C.K., and he said to be here around 2.
"He said"?
The doctor doesn't make appointments.
Well, I know him.
Well, I used to.
We went to high school together.
And I talked to him on the phone.
He said that I could come by.
He didn't put your name in the book and didn't tell me.
You don't have an appointment.
Can you check with him?
He's with a patient.
Okay, well, I'll just wait and...
Sir, you don't have an appointment.
Yeah, no, I get that, but can you just let me wait till he comes out and...?
You can't just sit in here if you don't have an appointment.
Do people, like, come here and steal medical treatment?
Do they steal it from you?
Is that what happens?
Why can't you just let me wait...?
Just keep up that regime.
You will start feeling better very soon.
Thanks, doctor.
No problem.
Hey, Ben, how you doing?
You told me to come by, remember?
Do I know you?
Oh.
Come on through.
It's fine, Priscilla.
Louis C.K.
I didn't mean to jump ahead of that woman if she was waiting.
Don't worry, she's dying.
Yeah, no hope.
Really sad.
It's cancer, from her vagina up to her eyeballs.
So I'm just squeezing her for insurance money till her liver falls out of her ass.
Man, that's not funny.
Oh, God, how are you?
I'm...
I feel like shit.
Feel like shit?
Sure you feel like shit and not diarrhea?
Because you look like diarrhea.
It looks like someone poured diarrhea into a face-shaped mold.
Could you stop?
I'm worried.
I don't know what's up with me.
Look up.
Okay.
I know what's wrong with you.
What?
AIDS.
I can't believe you're a doctor.
Strip down to your underpants.
Let's take a look at you.
Let's take a look at you.
Jesus.
That is...
You don't need a doctor, you need a time machine.
Did no one tell you tits are meant to be on women, not men?
What is that?
Come on, man.
This is a nightmare.
Get up here.
Oh, dear.
Okay.
Take a deep breath and hold it.
So how do you feel, really?
Apart from the tumor I can hear in your lungs.
You're an asshole.
Strip all the way down.
Okay.
Oh, God, Louie.
How can...?
That is really bad.
That's the worst penis I've ever seen in my life.
That is disgusting.
It's...
Oh, my God.
This is the worst thing that's happened to me, seeing that.
And my dad hung himself in front of me whilst masturbating.
If I could take one of those things back, it would be seeing that awful cock.
Looks like you've been getting a dog to suck it off, but it chewed it like it thought it was a horrible old blood-and-cum-filled shoe.
Nurse, can you come here a minute?
I'm serious.
That is the worst penis probably in the world.
Nurse?
Honestly, is that not the ugliest penis you've ever seen in your life?
Yes, doctor, it's very ugly.
Very ugly, very ugly.
She's a nurse, so...
Stop it.
Come on, man.
If that's your penis and testicles, what's your anus gonna be like?
Well, we're not gonna find that out.
We are gonna find out, because I need to give you a full rectal examination.
No, no.
No way.
Yes way.
You're over 40, Louie, okay?
No more wanking around.
This could save your life.
Okay, all right.
Come on.
All right.
Look, it's not very pleasant, but it's necessary.
Okay, all right.
Okay, I'll be as gentle as I can.
Thank you.
Ughh.
Sorry.
Is that okay?
Yeah, that's okay.
How about that?
Yeah, that's all right.
What about this?
Jesus Christ!
What?
This is serious.
What's wrong with you?
It's serious.
There's no way it's supposed to go in and out.
Well, it can do.
I'm a doctor.
Yeah.
And it tells me that everything is fine up there.
Jesus.
Listen.
I'm still going with AIDS, but let's do some blood work and find out.
My days start poorly because of the shape I'm in.
Because now, also, I'm 42, so I'm getting...
I'm get...
I'm really on the decline.
There's never gonna be another year of my life that was better than the year before.
That's never gonna happen again.
I've seen my best years.
And when I wake up in the morning, I just...
I'm...
I just sit there and I'm like:
Like, it's an awful way to start your day.
Every day starts with me...
Like, my eyes open and I reload the program of misery.
I just open my eyes, remember who I am what I'm like and I go:
"I guess.
I guess, just do it.
I don't know.
I guess.
Oh, my God. "
Somebody called me an Indian giver recently.
I don't know if you've heard that since you were kids but we used to call each other...
Indian giver is one of the most offensive things you could ever...
Because what it's meant to be is that someone gave you something then changed their minds.
That makes you an Indian giver.
And we equate this to the Indians because our feeling is that they gave us America, and then they...
Well, they didn't take it back, certainly, but they changed their minds about giving it to us.
It's offensive when you consider the truth which is that we got here and the Indians were like, "Hi. "
And we were like, "Hey, can we have everything?"
And they were like, "Well, we don't know what 'have' means but enjoy all the things that you need, like we do. "
So we start killing all of them.
And they were like:
"Oh, dude, could you not do that part where you kill all of us?
Because that's kind of a drag for us. "
And we were like, "You guys are Indian givers.
Oh, my God.
We're gonna name that after you.
You guys are dicks. "
Anyway, thanks a lot, folks.
Good night.
We're gonna keep this show going, gonna bring the next comic up.
Very funny guy.
You guys might know him.
Nick DiPaolo.
How about a hand for the emcee going through chemo, huh?
All right.
Poor prick.
Skinny, no hair.
How are you?
Okay.
Welcome to the basement of al Qaeda's hideout, and...
You think I'm kidding?
Those aren't Irish guys making your falafel.
How's it going?
It's a shitty night.
I have two tables, all black people, so I know I'm not making no tips.
Are you being serious right now?
Yeah, look over there.
I have two tables, they're all black.
I'm working for free tonight.
No, I mean, are you being seriously that racist?
What?
You don't know they're not gonna tip you.
Yes, I do.
Because they're black?
I've been waiting tables for five years.
I never got a tip from a black person, not once.
First of all, I don't believe you.
Second of all, that's still racist.
I am not racist.
Screw you.
What are you talking about?
She says black people don't tip.
Are you nuts?
Niggas don't tip.
Everyone knows that.
Have you ever waited tables before?
No.
Then shut up, asshole.
This is how I know I'm getting old.
I pulled a muscle in my neck giving my wife the finger behind her back.
That's a true story.
We were having a fight, she walked out of the kitchen, I went, ah, like that.
Weird things are happening to my body as I get older.
Ever hold a piss so long it turns into a shit?
That didn't happen when I was in high school.
I know most of you guys here voted for Obama and I don't know ******* why, but...
Ooh.
Listen to that silence, huh?
Holy shit, I hit you right in the white-guilt muscle, didn't I?
I mean, can we quit calling Obama the first black president?
My nipples are darker than Barack Obama.
They're so in love with this guy.
Wanna give him his own national holiday.
He hasn't even been shot yet.
This is perfect, they hate my guts.
All right.
People are such hypocrites down there.
I'm sure you did better at the Hitler Youth rally.
Ha, ha.
Liberal fag.
Yeah, okay, Himmler.
Why don't you go eat out Obama's asshole?
I would.
I mean, I'm not gay, but, you know, just to be part of history.
Country's going to shit.
You Republicans are babies.
You've had your way for eight years.
Why can't you just give somebody else a try?
Because it's a bullshit sham, that's why.
He's in there because of white guilt and affirmative action.
Anybody who has the balls to say that out loud is called a Nazi by deluded assholes like you.
Poor little Nazis don't like being called Nazis.
I'm sorry.
Can you stop having this conversation?
When Bush was in office, every time you put on the news all you saw was black people, gays, liberals just pissing and moaning at how bad he was.
But now Obama's in there, no one can say shit.
You know, if it's like you say it is and it's your turn then why don't we get a say in it like you did?
A white guy doesn't have a voice in this country anymore.
We supposed to feel sorry for white guys?
What, is 10,000 years of unchecked prosperity not enough for you?
No, it's not.
Give me 20-.
Well, how about 30-?
Yeah.
And then you can celebrate with a big parade of soldiers and have white columns with an eagle, maybe red banners with a white circle and something like this in the middle?
The Nazi thing?
That all you got?
That's why...
It's the same thing.
What is it, what?
It's one group getting what they want over everyone else.
Oh, yeah.
Over...
What the **** is wrong with you?
What's wrong with you?
What's wrong with you?
Pretend you're kidding, but you mean it.
My father fought those Nazis, okay?
So if you call me that again, I'm gonna punch you.
All right, I won't call you that, you Hitler Nazi piece of shit.
****
Mother...
Come on.
Come on, guys, break it up.
Come on.
******* ****
Come on.
Get off me.
Get the **** off me.
You cut my hand.
Goddamn it.
Nice.
Jeez, man, it looks bad.
Yeah, it does, doesn't it?
Dr. Green, telephone, please.
Dr. Green, telephone, please.
How long are they gonna make you wait?
I think the guy they're working on now has a musket wound.
Got blindsided by a Model T. I heard he got stepped on by a dinosaur.
At least you got that dirty jizz rag there seeping germs into your wound.
Yeah, and I think I saw the bartender spit into it and wipe up some AIDS vomit.
God.
So how are the kids?
Good.
They're at my place.
Babysitter.
They'll be waking me up in about four hours.
Must be nice.
Ah.
It's Andi.
Hello?
Hey, babe.
Yeah, no.
I'm out.
Nothing.
Yeah.
No, try to get some sleep.
All right.
You too.
Bye.
You didn't tell her where you are?
She's just gonna start worrying.
What's the use?
Must be nice having somebody at home worrying for you.
You got your kids.
Yeah, but a wife.
I mean, I just think it's great that you and Andi made it work, you know?
You've been together, what, 15 years?
Yeah, well, it ain't easy.
Well, at least you did it.
Miss your wife?
No, but I envy you.
The other day, I get a package in the mail, right?
It's from India.
I'm like, "What the hell's this shit?" So I open it up.
It's a brick of Viagra.
I look over at Andi, she's grinning.
Oh, my God.
Yeah, she ordered it online, you know.
I feel bad.
She's lonely.
But she's gorgeous, I don't wanna be with anybody else but, you know, some nights I don't know, I'd just rather have a burger and hit the sack.
Yeah, but you're working it out.
Yeah, we started counseling and every other night, I stick a wooden, medicated boner in her and now we sit around waiting to see who's gonna die first.
That's about it.
Jesus Christ, Nick.
I mean, we're getting old, Lou.
I mean, we can't have kids anymore.
Um...
I don't know.
At one point, one of us is gonna leave the other behind.
Oh, jeez.
I guess this is where the letter C comes for her dialysis.
Sorry about your hand, man.
It's all right.
I don't jerk off anymore and can lift the toilet seat with the other.
I'm fine.
I'm sorry I called you a Nazi.
Don't worry about it, faggot.
Hey, seriously, man.
You got your kids.
You're lucky.
I'm happy for you, really.
Thanks, Nick.
Remember when we were in our 20s we used to come home this late because we were out getting laid?
We never got laid.
I remember one time I was with a friend of mine who lives in New York also, and we went to pick up his cousin.
She lived on a farm her whole life.
Her family was this weird family that kept their kids on a farm.
Her parents finally died, so she got to leave.
And so she came down to visit her cousin, my friend, in the city and so we picked her up at Port Authority Bus Station.
She had never been to any city before, and we're picking her up at the Port Authority, that smelly hole of a place.
And we pick her up there, and she's just freaking out at New York.
She's never seen anything like it.
And we pass this homeless guy, and she sees him.
I mean, we all passed him, but she saw him.
She's the only one who actually saw him.
We didn't.
Me and her cousin were like, "So?
He's supposed to be there.
So what?
There's a perfectly good reason why that's not me and it's him.
The right people always win, I'm sure of it. "
But so there he is...
And this dude was particularly homeless.
He was one of those high-octane homeless, smelly...
Just piss smell.
The unbelievable piss smell, just...
He was piss.
He didn't just smell like piss, he was...
When you piss, he comes out.
That's what...
That's how much...
It's just this dude with garbage all over him.
I don't know if he had gathered it for warmth or folks just went, ech, all day.
And he had dreadlocks.
Not Hacky Sack, cool-guy, medical-marijuana dreadlocks just human-neglect clumps of hair.
A clump of hair for every year that no one knew his name or cared.
Yeah, that's who you've been laughing at the last 10 minutes.
That's how bad it was.
And again, me and my friend were just like, meh.
His cousin immediately just gets...
She's like, "Oh, my God. "
She takes a knee.
I'm not even taking a real knee now.
That's how little I give a shit about the guy.
He's not even here and I'm still like, "Eh.
Yeah, that's close enough. "
She goes, "Oh, my God, sir.
Are you okay?
What happened?"
"What happened?" America happened.
What do you mean, "What happened?"
So she's down there:
"Sir, can we call someone?"
And me and my friend...
This is the crazy part.
We immediately go to her, "Oh, no, no, no, honey, don't... "
We start correcting her behavior like she's doing something wrong.
She's like, "Why, is he okay?" "No, he needs you desperately.
That's not the point.
We just don't do that here.
You silly country girl. "
Hello?
Louie?
Hi, it's Dr. Ben.
Hey, what's up, man?
Yeah, yeah.
How are you?
Um...
Look, I got back your blood work.
Yeah?
Yeah, listen...
Oh, sorry about being an ass, by the way.
The thing is, I need you to come back in to do some more tests.
What...?
What for?
Well, your blood work shows that you may have slight big-fat-ginger-uglyitis.
Oh, my God.
You're such a dick.
No, um, you've got AIDS.
That's what I thought, and it proved...
Don't worry, the cancer is gonna kill the AIDS before it kills you quite slowly and painfully.
No, no, I'm...
You do have cancer, though, loads of it, in your scrotum.
In fact, that's all there is in the scrotum.
No balls at all, just two healthy lumps of cancer that replaced the horrible old squidgy bollocks that were there.
And that's gonna kill you as well.
So, by the way, the AIDS shows...
It's very extensive.
It shows that you got the AIDS from raping a little blind boy.

Thank you.
Thank you, everybody.
Nice to be here.
I feel pretty good today.
You know why I feel good?
'cause I-- finally, I have the body that I want,
And that's a thing people really covet.
It's a hard thing to achieve, and I did.
And I'm gonna tell you how
To have exactly the body that you want.
You just have to want...
A shitty body.
That's all it is.
You have to want your own shitty,
Ugly...
Disgusting body.
I don't, though, like being those things all the time.
I get really sweaty all the time.
I-- and that's also bad for sex, 'cause I just sweat--
I just rain sweat all over people.
Like, I'm like, "oh !"
And that's what I'm like when I have sex.
I go, "uhhh!
"uhhh!
Uhhh !"
And I always see her and she's like, just--
Just sweat is pouring off my head and she's like,
"dude, you're limiting my enjoyment by a lot."
N ) no.
Well, then you can call for an appointment.
The results from that test
Don't come in until tomorrow.
No, I have no way of knowing the results
Before they get here.
Yes?
I'm here to see Ben, Dr. Mitchell.
Okay, what time is your appointment
And what is your name?
My name's Louie c.K. And he said to be here around 2:00.
"he said"?
The doctor doesn't make appointments.
Oh, well, see, I know him.
We-
- I used to-- we went to high school together
And I talked to him on the phone.
He said that I could come by.
He didn't put your name in the book
And he didn't tell me, so you don't have an appointment.
Can you check with him?
He's with a patient.
Okay, well, I'll just wait and--
Sir, you don't have an appointment.
Yeah, no, I get that,
But can you just let me wait until he comes out and--
You can't just sit in here
If you don't have an appointment.
Do people, like, come here and steal medical treatment?
Do they steal it from you?
Is that what happens?
'cause why can't you just let me wait-- so just keep up that regime
And you will start feeling better very soon.
Thanks, doctor.
No problem.
Hey, Ben, how you doing?
You told me to come by, remember?
Do I know you?
Uh...
Come through.
It's fine, Priscilla.
Louie c.K. Hey, listen, I didn't mean to
Jump ahead of that woman if she was waiting.
Don't worry, she's...
She's dying.
Yeah, no hope-- really sad.
She has cancer
From her vagina up to her eyeballs.
So I'm just squeezing her for a little extra insurance money
Man, that's not funny.
Oh, God, how are you?
I'm, uh--
I feel like shit.
Feel like shit?
Are you sure you feel like shit and not diarrhea?
'cause you look like diarrhea.
It looks like someone poured diarrhea
Into a face-shaped mold.
Could you stop?
'cause I really am-- I'm worried.
I don't know what's up with me.
Look up.
Okay.
I know what's wrong with you.
What?
Aids.
I can't believe you're a doctor.
Strip down to your underpants.
Let's take a look at you.
Let's take a look at you.
Jesus.
That is-- you don't need a doctor,
You need a time machine.
Did no one tell you that tits
Are meant to be on women, not men?
What is that?
Come on, man.
This is a nightmare.
Get up here.
Oh, dear.
Okay.
Take a deep breath and hold it.
So how do you feel, really?
Apart from the tumor I can hear in your lungs?
You're an asshole.
Strip all the way down.
Oh, God, Louie.
How can-- that is...
Really bad.
That's the worst penis I've ever seen in my life.
That is disgusting.
It's--
Oh, my God.
This is the worst thing that's ever happened to me,
Seeing that,
And my dad hung himself in front of me
Whilst masturbating.
But if I could take one of those things back,
It would be seeing that awful cock.
It looks like you've been getting a dog to suck it off,
But it chewed it like it thought it was
A horrible old blood-and-cum-filled shoe.
Nurse, can you come here a minute?
I'm serious.
That is the worst penis
Probably in the world.
Nurse?
Honestly, is that not the ugliest penis
You've ever seen in your life?
Yes, doctor, it's very ugly.
Very ugly, very ugly.
She's a nurse, so--
Stop it.
Come on, man.
What worries me is, if that's your penis and testicles,
What's your anus gonna be like?
But we're not gonna find that out.
We are gonna find out because I need to give you
A full rectal examination.
No, no, no way.
Yes way.
You're over 40, Louie, okay?
No more wanking around.
This could save your life.
Okay, all right.
Come on.
Look, it's not very pleasant,
But it's necessary.
Okay, all right.
Okay, and I'll be as gentle as I can.
Thank you.
Sorry.
Is that okay?
Yeah, it's okay.
How about that?
Yeah, that's all right.
What about this?
Jesus Christ!
What?
This is serious.
What's wrong with you?
This is serious.
There's no way it's supposed to go in and out like that.
Well, it can do.
I'm a doctor.
Yeah!
And it tells me that everything is fine up there.
Jesus.
Listen, I'm still going with aids,
But let's do some blood work and find out.
My days start poorly, 'cause of the shape I'm in.
Because now, also, I'm 42, so I'm getting-
- I'm get--
I'm really on the decline.
There's never gonna be another year of my life
That was better than the year before.
That's never gonna happen again!
I've seen my best years.
And when I wake up in the morning,
I just-
- I'm-
- I just sit there and I'm like,
"oh..."
It's an awful way to start your day.
Every day starts with me, like, my eyes open
And I reload the program of misery.
I just open eyes,
Remember who I am,
What I'm like...
And I go, "ugh.
"I guess.
"I guess do it.
"I don't know.
I guess-- oh, my God."
Somebody called me an Indian giver recently.
I don't know if you've heard that expression
Since you were kids,
But I remember we used to call each other--
"Indian giver" is one of the most offensive things
You could ever-- because what it's meant to be
Is that someone gave you something
And then they changed their minds.
That makes you an Indian giver.
And we equate this to the indians
Because our feeling is that they gave us America,
And then they--
Well, they didn't take it back, certainly,
But they chang
Which is that we got here and the indians were like, "hi."
And we were like, "hey, can we have everything ?"
And they were like, "well, we don't know what 'have' means,
But enjoy all the things that you need, like we do."
So we start killing all of them.
And they were like, "oh, dude,
"could you not do that part where you kill all of us?
'cause that's kind of a drag for us."
And we're like, "you guys are Indian givers!
"oh, my God!
"we're gonna name that after you.
You guys are dicks !"
Anyway, thanks a lot, folks, good night.
We're gonna keep this show going,
We're gonna bring the next comic up.
Very funny guy, you guys might know him.
Nick DiPaolo.
Whoa!
How about a hand for the emcee, going through chemo, huh?
All right.
Poor prick-- skinny, no hair.
How are you?
Welcome to the basement of al-qaeda's hideout and...
You think I'm kidding?
Those aren't Irish guys making your falafel
In the kitchen upstairs.
How's it going?
It's a shitty night tonight.
I have two tables, all black people,
So I know I'm not making no tips.
Are you being serious right now?
Yeah, look over there.
I have two tables, they're all black.
I'm working for free tonight.
No, I mean, are you being seriously that racist?
What?
You don't know that they're not gonna tip you.
Yes, I do.
Just 'cause they're black?
I've been waiting tables for five years,
I never got a tip from a black person, not once.
First of all, I don't believe you.
Second of all, that's still racist.
I am not racist.
Screw you.
What are you talking about?
She says black people don't tip.
Are you nuts?
Niggas don't tip.
Everyone knows that.
Have you ever waited tables before?
No.
Then shut up, asshole.
I'm getting old.
This is how I know I'm getting old.
I actually pulled a muscle in my neck
Giving my wife the finger behind her back.
That's a true story.
We're having a fight, she walked out of the kitchen,
I went-
- Ahh!
Like that.
Weird things are happening to my body as I get older.
Ever hold a piss so long it turns into a shit?
That didn't happen when I was in high school.
.
Ooh, listen to that silence, huh?
Holy shit, I hit you right in
The "white guilt" muscle, didn't I?
I mean, can we quit calling Obama
The first black president?
My nipples are darker than Barack Obama.
They're so in love with this guy.
They want to give him his own national holiday, Barack?
He hasn't even been shot yet.
Ooh...
This is perfect, they hate my guts.
All right.
People are such hypocrites down there.
I'm sure you did better at the Hitler youth rally.
Ha-ha, liberal fag.
Yeah, okay, himmler.
Why don't you just go eat out Obama's asshole?
I would.
I mean, I'm not gay, but just to be part of history.
Country's going to shit.
You know, you Republicans are such babies.
You've had your way for eight years,
Why can't you just give somebody else a try?
Because it's a bullshit sham, that's why.
He's in there because of white guilt
And affirmative action.
And anybody who has the balls to say that out loud
Is called a nazi by deluded assholes like you.
Poor little nazis don't like being called nazis.
I'm sorry.
Can you guys stop having this conversation?
You know, when bush was in office,
Every time you put on the news,
All you saw was black people, gays, liberals
Just pissing and moaning at how bad he was.
Nobody-- but now Obama's in there, no one can say shit.
You know, if it's like you say it is
And it's your turn, then how--
Why don't we get a say in it, like you did?
I mean, a white guy doesn't have a voice
In this country anymore.
Are we supposed to feel sorry for white guys?
What, is 10,000 years of unchecked prosperity,
That's not enough for you?
No, it's not, give me 20.
Well, how about 30?
Yeah.
And then you can celebrate with a big parade of soldiers
And have white columns with an eagle,
Maybe some red banners with a white circle
And have something like this going in the middle of it?
The nazi thing again?
Is that all you got?
Yeah, well, that's what-- it's the same thing--
What is it, what?
It's one group--
Come up with a different argument.
... Get what they want over everyone else.
Over, over--
What the ( bleep ) is wrong with you?
What the ( bleep ) is wrong with you?
What the ( bleep ) is wrong with you?
You pretend you're kidding, but you really mean it.
My father fought those nazis, okay?
So if you call me that again,
I'm gonna punch you in the face!
All right, I won't call you that,
You Hitler nazi piece of shit!
Come on.
Get off me!
Get the ( bleep ) off me!
You cut my hand.
Goddamnit.
Nice.
Jeez, man, it looks bad.
Yeah, it does, doesn't it?
Dr. Green, telephone, please.
Dr. Green, telephone, please.
How long they gonna make you wait?
I ink the guy they're working on now
Has a musket wound.
Got blindsided by a model t.
I heard he got stepped on by a dinosaur.
At least you got that dirty jizz rag there
Seeping germs into your wound.
I think I saw the bartender spit into it
And wipe up some aids vomit.
God.
So how are the kids?
Good.
They're at my place.
Babysitter.
They'll be waking me up in about four hours.
Must be nice.
Oh, it's andie.
Hello, hey, babe.
Yeah, no.
I'm out.
Nothing.
Yeah, no, try to get some sleep.
All right, you too.
Bye.
You didn't tell her where you are?
She's gonna start worrying, what's the use?
Must be nice having somebody at home worrying for you.
You got your kids.
Yeah, but a wife.
I mean, I just think it's great that you and andie
Made it work, you know?
You've been together, what, 15 years?
Yeah, well, it ain't easy.
Well, at least you did it.
Miss your wife?
No, but I envy you.
The other day, I get a package in the mail, right?
It's from India.
I'm like, what the hell's this shit?
So I open it up.
It's a brick of Viagra.
I look over at andie, she's grinning.
Oh, my God.
Yeah, she ordered on-line, you know.
I feel bad, she's lonely.
She's gorgeous,
I don't want to be with anybody else,
But, you know, some nights...
I don't know.
I'd just rather have a burger and hit the sack.
Yeah, we started counseling
And every other night
I stick a wooden medicated boner in her
And now just-- we sit around waiting to see
Who's gonna die first.
That's about it.
Jesus Christ, Nick.
I mean, we're getting old, Lou.
I mean, we can't have kids anymore.
Um...
I don't know.
At one point, one of us is gonna leave the other behind.
Oh, jeez.
I guess this is where the letter "c"
Comes for her dialysis.
Sorry about your hand, man.
It's all right, I don't jerk off anymore
And I can lift the toilet seat with the other one.
I'm fine.
I'm sorry I called you a nazi.
Don't worry about it, faggot.
Uh...
Hey, seriously, man.
You got your kids, you're lucky.
I'm happy for you, really.
Thanks, Nick.
Remember when we were in our 20s,
We used to come home this late 'cause we were out getting laid?
We never got laid.
I remember one time I was with a friend of mine
Who lives in New York also,
And we went to go pick up his cousin--
She lives on a farm in new Hampshire her whole life.
Her family is this weird family that kept her kids on a farm.
Anyway, her parents finally died, so she got to leave,
And so she came down to visit her cousin,
My friend in the city,
And so we picked her up at port authority bus station.
She had never been to any city before
And we're picking her up at the port authority,
That smelly hole of a place.
And we pick her up there and she's just freaking out
At New York.
She's never seen anything like it.
And we pass this homeless guy and she sees him--
I mean, we all passed him, but she saw him.
She's the only one who actually saw him.
We didn't-- me and her cousin were like, "so?
"he's supposed to be there.
"so what?
"there's a perfectly good reason why that's not me and it's him.
The right people always win, I'm sure of it."
But, so there he is,
And this dude was particularly homeless.
He was one of those high-octane homeless,
Smelly, just piss smell,
The unbelievable piss smell, just--
He was piss.
He didn't just smell like piss, he was--
When you piss, he comes out.
That's what-- that's how much...
I don't know if he had gathered it for warmth
Or folks just went, "ek," all day.
And he had dreadlocks.
Not hacky sack, cool-guy, medical-marijuana dreadlocks,
Just "human-neglect clumps" of hair.
A clump of hair for every year
That no one knew his name or cared.
Yeah, that's who you've been laughing at
For the last ten minutes.
That's how bad it was.
And again, me and my friend were just like, "hmph."
His cousin immediately just gets--
She's like, "oh, my God !"
She takes a knee.
That's how-
- I mean, I'm not even taking a real knee now,
That's how little I give a shit about the guy.
He's not even here and I'm still like,
"hmph, yeah, that's close enough."
She goes, "oh, my God, sir, are you okay?
What happened ?"
"what happened ?"
America happened.
What do you mean, "what happened ?"
So she's down there-- "sir, can we call someone ?"
And me and my friend, we're from New York,
This is the crazy part, we immediately go to her,
"oh, no, no, no, honey, don't..."
We start correcting her behavior
Like she's doing something wrong.
She's like, "why, is he okay ?"
"no, no, he needs you desperately,
"that's not the point.
"we just don't do that here.
You silly country girl."
Hello?
Louie?
Hi, it's doctor Ben.
Hey, what's up man?
Yeah, yeah, how are you?
Um...
Look...
I got back your blood work.
Yeah?
Yeah, listen.
I'm sorry about being an arse...
By the way, um...
Te thing is I need you to come back here to do some more tests.
What...
What for?
Well, your blood work shows... that... you may have... slight... big fat... gingi-ugly-itis...
Oh, my God, you're such a dick.
No, um, you've got AIDS.
That's why I thought I need prove, but don't worry, the cancer is gonna eventually kill the AIDS before... it kills you quite slowly and... and painfully.
No, no...
You do have cancer, though.
Loads of it.
In your scrotum.
Um, in fact, that's all there is in the scrotum.
No balls at all, just two healthy lumps of cancer replaced the horrible *** bollocks in there.
And that's gonna... kill you as well, so um...
By the way, the AIDS shows um, this very... extensive shows that you... got the AIDS from raping a little blind boy...
Louie...

[AUDIENCE APPLAUDING]
Thank you.
Thank you, everybody.
Nice to be here.
I feel pretty good today.
You know why I feel good?
Because I--
Finally, I have the body that I want and that's a thing people really covet.
It's a hard thing to achieve, and I did.
And I'm gonna tell you how to have exactly the body that you want.
You just have to want a shitty body.
That's all it is.
[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]
You have to want your own shitty, ugly, disgusting body.
I don't, though, like being uncomfortable and unhealthy and I'm both of those things all the time.
I get really sweaty all the time.
I--
And that's also bad for sex, because I just sweat--
I just rain sweat all over people.
Like, I'm like, uhhh.
And that's what I'm like when I have sex.
I go, uhhh.
[BELLOWING]
And I always see her, and she's like, just:
Just sweat is pouring off my head.
And she's like, "Dude, you're limiting my enjoyment by a lot."
WOMAN:
No.
Well, then you can call for an appointment.
The results from that test don't come in until tomorrow.
No, I have no way of knowing the results before they get here.
Yes?
I'm here to see Ben, Dr. Mitchell.
Okay, what time is your appointment and what is your name?
My name's Louie C.K., and he said to be here around 2.
"He said"?
The doctor doesn't make appointments.
Well, I know him.
Well, I used to.
We went to high school together.
And I talked to him on the phone.
He said that I could come by.
He didn't put your name in the book and didn't tell me.
You don't have an appointment.
Can you check with him?
He's with a patient.
Okay, well, I'll just wait and-- Sir, you don't have an appointment.
Yeah, no, I get that, but can you just let me wait till he comes out and--?
You can't just sit in here if you don't have an appointment.
Do people, like, come here and steal medical treatment?
Do they steal it from you?
Is that what happens?
Why can't you just let me wait--?
MAN:
Just keep up that regime.
You will start feeling better very soon.
Thanks, doctor.
No problem.
Hey, Ben, how you doing?
You told me to come by, remember?
Do I know you?
[LAUGHS]
Oh.
Come on through.
It's fine, Priscilla.
Louis C.K.
I didn't mean to jump ahead of that woman if she was waiting.
Don't worry, she's dying.
Yeah, no hope.
Really sad.
It's cancer, from her vagina up to her eyeballs.
So I'm just squeezing her for insurance money till her liver falls out of her ass.
[LAUGHING]
Man, that's not funny.
Oh, God, how are you?
I'm-
- I feel like shit.
Feel like shit?
Sure you feel like shit and not diarrhea?
Because you look like diarrhea.
It looks like someone poured diarrhea into a face-shaped mold.
[LAUGHING]
Could you stop?
I'm worried.
I don't know what's up with me.
Look up.
Okay.
I know what's wrong with you.
What?
AIDS.
I can't believe you're a doctor.
Strip down to your underpants.
Let's take a look at you.
Let's take a look at you.
Jesus.
That is--
You don't need a doctor, you need a time machine.
Did no one tell you tits are meant to be on women, not men?
What is that?
Come on, man.
This is a nightmare.
Get up here.
Oh, dear.
Okay.
Take a deep breath and hold it.
So how do you feel, really?
Apart from the tumor I can hear in your lungs.
You're an asshole.
Strip all the way down.
Okay.
Oh, God, Louie.
How can--?
That is really bad.
That's the worst penis I've ever seen in my life.
That is disgusting.
It's-
- Oh, my God.
This is the worst thing that's happened to me, seeing that.
And my dad hung himself in front of me whilst masturbating.
If I could take one of those things back, it would be seeing that awful cock.
Looks like you've been getting a dog to suck it off, but it chewed it like it thought it was a horrible old blood-and-cum-filled shoe.
Nurse, can you come here a minute?
I'm serious.
That is the worst penis probably in the world.
Nurse?
Honestly, is that not the ugliest penis you've ever seen in your life?
Yes, doctor, it's very ugly.
Very ugly, very ugly.
She's a nurse, so....
Stop it.
Come on, man.

Look, it's not very pleasant, but it's necessary.
Okay, all right.
Okay, I'll be as gentle as I can.
Thank you.
Ughh.
Sorry.
Is that okay?
Yeah, that's okay.
How about that?
Yeah, that's all right.
What about this?
Jesus Christ!
What?
This is serious.
What's wrong with you?
It's serious.
There's no way it's supposed to go in and out.
Well, it can do.
I'm a doctor.
Yeah.
And it tells me that everything is fine up there.
Jesus.
Listen.
I'm still going with AIDS, but let's do some blood work and find out.
My days start poorly because of the shape I'm in.

That's never gonna happen again.
I've seen my best years.
And when I wake up in the morning, I just-- I'm-

[GROANS]
Like, it's an awful way to start your day.
Every day starts with me--
Like, my eyes open and I reload the program of misery.
I just open my eyes, remember who I am what I'm like and I go:
[GROANS]
"I guess.
I guess, just do it.
I don't know.
I guess.
Oh, my God."
Somebody called me an Indian giver recently.
I don't know if you've heard that since you were kids but we used to call each other--
Indian giver is one of the most offensive things you could ever--
Because what it's meant to be is that someone gave you something then changed their minds.
That makes you an Indian giver.

We're gonna keep this show going, gonna bring the next comic up.
Very funny guy.

Nick DiPaolo.
[AUDIENCE APPLAUDING]
How about a hand for the emcee going through chemo, huh?
All right.
Poor prick.
Skinny, no hair.
How are you?
MAN:
Okay.
Welcome to the basement of al Qaeda's hideout, and....
You think I'm kidding?
Those aren't Irish guys making your falafel.
How's it going?
It's a shitty night.
I have two tables, all black people, so I know I'm not making no tips.
Are you being serious right now?
Yeah, look over there.
I have two tables, they're all black.
I'm working for free tonight.
No, I mean, are you being seriously that racist?
What?
You don't know they're not gonna tip you.
Yes, I do.
Because they're black?
I've been waiting tables for five years.
I never got a tip from a black person, not once.
First of all, I don't believe you.
Second of all, that's still racist.
I am not racist.
Screw you.
What are you talking about?
She says black people don't tip.
Are you nuts?
Niggas don't tip.
Everyone knows that.
Have you ever waited tables before?
No.
Then shut up, asshole.
This is how I know I'm getting old.
I pulled a muscle in my neck giving my wife the finger behind her back.
That's a true story.
We were having a fight, she walked out of the kitchen, I went, ah, like that.
Weird things are happening to my body as I get older.
Ever hold a piss so long it turns into a shit?
That didn't happen when I was in high school.
I know most of you guys here voted for Obama and I don't know ******* why, but....
Ooh.
Listen to that silence, huh?
Holy shit, I hit you right in the white-guilt muscle, didn't I?
I mean, can we quit calling Obama the first black president?
My nipples are darker than Barack Obama.
They're so in love with this guy.
Wanna give him his own national holiday.
He hasn't even been shot yet.
[AUDIENCE GROANS]
This is perfect, they hate my guts.
All right.
People are such hypocrites down there.
I'm sure you did better at the Hitler Youth rally.
Ha, ha.
Liberal fag.
Yeah, okay, Himmler.
Why don't you go eat out Obama's asshole?
I would.
I mean, I'm not gay, but, you know, just to be part of history.
Country's going to shit.
You Republicans are babies.
You've had your way for eight years.
Why can't you just give somebody else a try?
Because it's a bullshit sham, that's why.
He's in there because of white guilt and affirmative action.
Anybody who has the balls to say that out loud is called a Nazi by deluded assholes like you.
Poor little Nazis don't like being called Nazis.
I'm sorry.
Can you stop having this conversation?
When Bush was in office, every time you put on the news all you saw was black people, gays, liberals just pissing and moaning at how bad he was.
But now Obama's in there, no one can say shit.
You know, if it's like you say it is and it's your turn then why don't we get a say in it like you did?
A white guy doesn't have a voice in this country anymore.
We supposed to feel sorry for white guys?
What, is 10,000 years of unchecked prosperity not enough for you?
No, it's not.
Give me 20-.
Well, how about 30-?
Yeah.
And then you can celebrate with a big parade of soldiers and have white columns with an eagle, maybe red banners with a white circle and something like this in the middle?
The Nazi thing?
That all you got?
That's why-
- It's the same thing.
What is it, what?
It's one group getting what they want over everyone else.
Oh, yeah.
Over-
- What the **** is wrong with you?
What's wrong with you?
What's wrong with you?
Pretend you're kidding, but you mean it.
My father fought those Nazis, okay?
So if you call me that again, I'm gonna punch you.
All right, I won't call you that, you Hitler Nazi piece of shit.
NICK:
**** .
Mother-- Come on.
Come on, guys, break it up.
Come on.
******* **** .
Come on.
NICK:
Get off me.
Get the **** off me.
You cut my hand.
Goddamn it.
Nice.
Jeez, man, it looks bad.
Yeah, it does, doesn't it?
WOMAN [OVER PA]:
Dr. Green, telephone, please.
Dr. Green, telephone, please.
How long are they gonna make you wait?
I think the guy they're working on now has a musket wound.
Got blindsided by a Model T. I heard he got stepped on by a dinosaur.
At least you got that dirty jizz rag there seeping germs into your wound.
Yeah, and I think I saw the bartender spit into it and wipe up some AIDS vomit.
God.
So how are the kids?
Good.
They're at my place.
Babysitter.
They'll be waking me up in about four hours.
Must be nice.
[PHONE RINGS]
Ah.
It's Andi.
Hello?
Hey, babe.
Yeah, no.
I'm out.
Nothing.
Yeah.
No, try to get some sleep.
All right.
You too.
Bye.
You didn't tell her where you are?
She's just gonna start worrying.
What's the use?
Must be nice having somebody at home worrying for you.
You got your kids.
Yeah, but a wife.
I mean, I just think it's great that you and Andi made it work, you know?
You've been together, what, 15 years?
Yeah, well, it ain't easy.
Well, at least you did it.
Miss your wife?
No, but I envy you.
The other day, I get a package in the mail, right?
It's from India.
I'm like, "What the hell's this shit?" So I open it up.
It's a brick of Viagra.
I look over at Andi, she's grinning.
Oh, my God.
Yeah, she ordered it online, you know.
I feel bad.
She's lonely.
But she's gorgeous, I don't wanna be with anybody else but, you know, some nights I don't know, I'd just rather have a burger and hit the sack.
Yeah, but you're working it out.
Yeah, we started counseling and every other night, I stick a wooden, medicated boner in her and now we sit around waiting to see who's gonna die first.
That's about it.
Jesus Christ, Nick.
I mean, we're getting old, Lou.
I mean, we can't have kids anymore.
Um....
I don't know.
At one point, one of us is gonna leave the other behind.
Oh, jeez.
I guess this is where the letter C comes for her dialysis.
[LOUIE LAUGHING]
LOUIE:
Sorry about your hand, man.
NICK:
It's all right.
I don't jerk off anymore and can lift the toilet seat with the other.
I'm fine.
I'm sorry I called you a Nazi.
Don't worry about it, faggot.
Hey, seriously, man.
You got your kids.
You're lucky.
I'm happy for you, really.
Thanks, Nick.
Remember when we were in our 20s we used to come home this late because we were out getting laid?
We never got laid.
[LAUGHS]
LOUIE:
I remember one time I was with a friend of mine who lives in New York also, and we went to pick up his cousin.
She lived on a farm her whole life.
Her family was this weird family that kept their kids on a farm.
Her parents finally died, so she got to leave.
And so she came down to visit her cousin, my friend, in the city and so we picked her up at Port Authority Bus Station.
She had never been to any city before, and we're picking her up at the Port Authority, that smelly hole of a place.
[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]
And we pick her up there, and she's just freaking out at New York.
She's never seen anything like it.
And we pass this homeless guy, and she sees him.
I mean, we all passed him, but she saw him.
She's the only one who actually saw him.
We didn't.
Me and her cousin were like, "So?
He's supposed to be there.
So what?
There's a perfectly good reason why that's not me and it's him.
The right people always win, I'm sure of it."
But so there he is-- And this dude was particularly homeless.
He was one of those high-octane homeless, smelly--
Just piss smell.
The unbelievable piss smell, just-- He was piss.
He didn't just smell like piss, he was-- When you piss, he comes out.
That's what-
- That's how much....
It's just this dude with garbage all over him.
I don't know if he had gathered it for warmth or folks just went, ech, all day.
And he had dreadlocks.
Not Hacky Sack, cool-guy, medical-marijuana dreadlocks just human-neglect clumps of hair.
A clump of hair for every year that no one knew his name or cared.
Yeah, that's who you've been laughing at the last 10 minutes.
That's how bad it was.
And again, me and my friend were just like, meh.
His cousin immediately just gets-- She's like, "Oh, my God."
She takes a knee.
I'm not even taking a real knee now.
That's how little I give a shit about the guy.
He's not even here and I'm still like, "Eh.
Yeah, that's close enough."
She goes, "Oh, my God, sir.
Are you okay?
What happened?"
"What happened?" America happened.
What do you mean, "What happened?"
So she's down there:
"Sir, can we call someone?"
And me and my friend-- This is the crazy part.
We immediately go to her, "Oh, no, no, no, honey, don't...."
We start correcting her behavior like she's doing something wrong.
She's like, "Why, is he okay?" "No, he needs you desperately.
That's not the point.
We just don't do that here.
You silly country girl."
[PHONE RINGING]
Hello?
Louie?
Hi, it's Dr. Ben.
Hey, what's up, man?
Yeah, yeah.
How are you?
Um....
Look, I got back your blood work.
Yeah?
Yeah, listen-- Oh, sorry about being an ass, by the way.
The thing is, I need you to come back in to do some more tests.
What--?
What for?
Well, your blood work shows that you may have slight big-fat-ginger-uglyitis.
Oh, my God.
You're such a dick.
No, um, you've got AIDS.
That's what I thought, and it proved--
Don't worry, the cancer is gonna kill the AIDS before it kills you quite slowly and painfully.
No, no, I'm--
You do have cancer, though, loads of it, in your scrotum.
In fact, that's all there is in the scrotum.
No balls at all, just two healthy lumps of cancer that replaced the horrible old squidgy bollocks that were there.
And that's gonna kill you as well.
So, by the way, the AIDS shows-- It's very extensive.
It shows that you got the AIDS from raping a little blind boy.
Louie?

( crowd applauding )
Thank you.
Thank you, everybody.
Nice to be here.
I feel pretty good today.
You know why I feel good?
'cause I-- finally, I have the body that I want,
And that's a thing people really covet.
It's a hard thing to achieve, and I did.
And I'm gonna tell you how
To have exactly the body that you want.
You just have to want...
A shitty body.
That's all it is.
You have to want your own shitty,
Ugly...
Disgusting body.
I don't, though, like being those things all the time.
I get really sweaty all the time.
I-- and that's also bad for sex, 'cause I just sweat--
I just rain sweat all over people.
Like, I'm like, "oh !"
And that's what I'm like when I have sex.
I go, "uhhh!
"uhhh!
Uhhh !"
And I always see her and she's like, just--
Just sweat is pouring off my head and she's like,
"dude, you're limiting my enjoyment by a lot."
( crowd laughing )
N ) no.
Well, then you can call for an appointment.
The results from that test
Don't come in until tomorrow.
No, I have no way of knowing the results
I'm here to see Ben, Dr. Mitchell.
Okay, what time is your appointment
And what is your name?
My name's Louie c.K. And he said to be here around 2:00.
"he said"?
The doctor doesn't make appointments.
Oh, well, see, I know him.
We-
- I used to-- we went to high school together
And I talked to him on the phone.
He said that I could come by.
He didn't put your name in the book
And he didn't tell me, so you don't have an appointment.
Can you check with him?
He's with a patient.
Okay, well, I'll just wait and--
Sir, you don't have an appointment.
Yeah, no, I get that,
But can you just let me wait until he comes out and--
You can't just sit in here
If you don't have an appointment.
Do people, like, come here and steal medical treatment?
Do they steal it from you?
Is that what happens?
'cause why can't you just let me wait--
( men ) so just keep up that regime
And you will start feeling better very soon.
Thanks, doctor.
No problem.
Hey, Ben, how you doing?
You told me to come by, remember?
Do I know you?
( snickering ) uh...
Come through.
It's fine, Priscilla.
Louie c.K. Hey, listen, I didn't mean to
Jump ahead of that woman if she was waiting.
Don't worry, she's...
She's dying.
Yeah, no hope-- really sad.
She has cancer
From her vagina up to her eyeballs.
So I'm just squeezing her for a little extra insurance money
Man, that's not funny.
Oh, God, how are you?
I'm, uh--
I feel like shit.
Feel like shit?
Are you sure you feel like shit and not diarrhea?
'cause you look like diarrhea.
It looks like someone poured diarrhea
Into a face-shaped mold.
( chuckling ) could you stop?
'cause I really am-- I'm worried.
I don't know what's up with me.
Look up.
Okay.
I know what's wrong with you.
What?
Aids.
( cackling )
I can't believe you're a doctor.
Strip down to your underpants.
Let's take a look at you.
Let's take a look at you.
Jesus.
That is-- you don't need a doctor,
You need a time machine.
Did no one tell you that tits
Are meant to be on women, not men?
What is that?
Come on, man.
( giggling ) this is a nightmare.
Get up here.
Oh, dear.
Okay.
Take a deep breath and hold it.
( inhaling )
So how do you feel, really?
Apart from the tumor I can hear in your lungs?
( cackling )
You're an asshole.
Strip all the way down.
Oh, God, Louie.
How can-- that is...
Really bad.
That's the worst penis I've ever seen in my life.
That is disgusting.
It's--
Oh, my God.
This is the worst thing that's ever happened to me,
Seeing that,
And my dad hung himself in front of me
Whilst masturbating.
But if I could take one of those things back,
It would be seeing that awful cock.
It looks like you've been getting a dog to suck it off,
But it chewed it like it thought it was
A horrible old blood-and-cum-filled shoe.
Nurse, can you come here a minute?
I'm serious.
That is the worst penis
Probably in the world.
Nurse?
Honestly, is that not the ugliest penis
You've ever seen in your life?
Yes, doctor, it's very ugly.
Very ugly, very ugly.
She's a nurse, so--
Stop it.
Come on, man.
What worries me is, if that's your penis and testicles,
What's your anus gonna be like?
But we're not gonna find that out.
We are gonna find out because I need to give you
A full rectal examination.
No, no, no way.
Yes way.
You're over 40, Louie, okay?
No more wanking around.
This could save your life.
Okay, all right.
Come on.
Look, it's not very pleasant,
But it's necessary.
Okay, all right.
Okay, and I'll be as gentle as I can.
Thank you.
( groaning ) sorry.
Is that okay?
Yeah, it's okay.
How about that?
Yeah, that's all right.
What about this?
Jesus Christ!
What?
This is serious.
What's wrong with you?
This is serious.
There's no way it's supposed to go in and out like that.
Well, it can do.
I'm a doctor.
Yeah!
And it tells me that everything is fine up there.
Jesus.
Listen, I'm still going with aids,
But let's do some blood work and find out.
My days start poorly, 'cause of the shape I'm in.
Because now, also, I'm 42, so I'm getting-
- I'm get--
I'm really on the decline.
There's never gonna be another year of my life
That was better than the year before.
That's never gonna happen again!
I've seen my best years.
And when I wake up in the morning,
I just-
- I'm-
- I just sit there and I'm like,
"oh..."
It's an awful way to start your day.
Every day starts with me, like, my eyes open
And I reload the program of misery.
I just open eyes,
Remember who I am,
What I'm like...
And I go, "ugh.
"I guess.
"I guess do it.
"I don't know.
I guess-- oh, my God."
Somebody called me an Indian giver recently.
I don't know if you've heard that expression
Since you were kids,
But I remember we used to call each other--
"Indian giver" is one of the most offensive things
You could ever-- because what it's meant to be
Is that someone gave you something
And then they changed their minds.
That makes you an Indian giver.
And we equate this to the indians
Because our feeling is that they gave us America,
And then they--
Well, they didn't take it back, certainly,
But they chang
Which is that we got here and the indians were like, "hi."
And we were like, "hey, can we have everything ?"
And they were like, "well, we don't know what 'have' means,
But enjoy all the things that you need, like we do."
So we start killing all of them.
And they were like, "oh, dude,
"could you not do that part where you kill all of us?
'cause that's kind of a drag for us."
And we're like, "you guys are Indian givers!
"oh, my God!
"we're gonna name that after you.
You guys are dicks !"
Anyway, thanks a lot, folks, good night.
( applauding )
We're gonna keep this show going,
We're gonna bring the next comic up.
Very funny guy, you guys might know him.
Nick DiPaolo.
( cheering )
Whoa!
How about a hand for the emcee, going through chemo, huh?
All right.
Poor prick-- skinny, no hair.
How are you?
Welcome to the basement of al-qaeda's hideout and...
You think I'm kidding?
Those aren't Irish guys making your falafel
In the kitchen upstairs.
How's it going?
It's a shitty night tonight.
I have two tables, all black people,
So I know I'm not making no tips.
Are you being serious right now?
Yeah, look over there.
I have two tables, they're all black.
I'm working for free tonight.
No, I mean, are you being seriously that racist?
What?
You don't know that they're not gonna tip you.
Yes, I do.
Just 'cause they're black?
I've been waiting tables for five years,
I never got a tip from a black person, not once.
First of all, I don't believe you.
Second of all, that's still racist.
I am not racist.
Screw you.
What are you talking about?
She says black people don't tip.
Are you nuts?
Niggas don't tip.
Everyone knows that.
Have you ever waited tables before?
No.
Then shut up, asshole.
I'm getting old.
This is how I know I'm getting old.
I actually pulled a muscle in my neck
Giving my wife the finger behind her back.
( laughing )
That's a true story.
We're having a fight, she walked out of the kitchen,
I went-
- Ahh!
Like that.
Weird things are happening to my body as I get older.
Ever hold a piss so long it turns into a shit?
That didn't happen when I was in high school.
.
Ooh, listen to that silence, huh?
Holy shit, I hit you right in
The "white guilt" muscle, didn't I?
I mean, can we quit calling Obama
The first black president?
My nipples are darker than Barack Obama.
They're so in love with this guy.
They want to give him his own national holiday, Barack?
He hasn't even been shot yet.
( crowd ) ooh...
This is perfect, they hate my guts.
All right.
People are such hypocrites down there.
I'm sure you did better at the Hitler youth rally.
Ha-ha, liberal fag.
Yeah, okay, himmler.
Why don't you just go eat out Obama's asshole?

Because it's a bullshit sham, that's why.
He's in there because of white guilt
And affirmative action.
And anybody who has the balls to say that out loud
Is called a nazi by deluded assholes like you.
Poor little nazis don't like being called nazis.
I'm sorry.
Can you guys stop having this conversation?
You know, when bush was in office,
Every time you put on the news,
All you saw was black people, gays, liberals
Just pissing and moaning at how bad he was.
Nobody-- but now Obama's in there, no one can say shit.
You know, if it's like you say it is
And it's your turn, then how--
Why don't we get a say in it, like you did?
I mean, a white guy doesn't have a voice
In this country anymore.
Are we supposed to feel sorry for white guys?
What, is 10,000 years of unchecked prosperity,
That's not enough for you?
No, it's not, give me 20.
Well, how about 30?
Yeah.
And then you can celebrate with a big parade of soldiers
And have white columns with an eagle,
Maybe some red banners with a white circle
And have something like this going in the middle of it?
The nazi thing again?
Is that all you got?
Yeah, well, that's what-- it's the same thing--
What is it, what?
It's one group--
Come up with a different argument.
... Get what they want over everyone else.
Over, over--
What the ( bleep ) is wrong with you?
What the ( bleep ) is wrong with you?
What the ( bleep ) is wrong with you?
You pretend you're kidding, but you really mean it.
My father fought those nazis, okay?
So if you call me that again,
I'm gonna punch you in the face!
All right, I won't call you that,
You Hitler nazi piece of shit!
( bleep )
Come on.
Get off me!
Get the ( bleep ) off me!
You cut my hand.
Goddamnit.
Nice.
Jeez, man, it looks bad.
Yeah, it does, doesn't it?
( woman on loudspeaker ) dr.
Green, telephone, please.
Dr. Green, telephone, please.
How long they gonna make you wait?
I ink the guy they're working on now
Has a musket wound.
Got blindsided by a model t.
I heard he got stepped on by a dinosaur.
At least you got that dirty jizz rag there
Seeping germs into your wound.
I think I saw the bartender spit into it
And wipe up some aids vomit.
God.
So how are the kids?
Good.
They're at my place.
Babysitter.
They'll be waking me up in about four hours.
Must be nice.
( cell phone ringing )
Oh, it's andie.
Hello, hey, babe.
Yeah, no.
I'm out.
Nothing.
Yeah, no, try to get some sleep.
All right, you too.
Bye.
You didn't tell her where you are?
She's gonna start worrying, what's the use?
Must be nice having somebody at home worrying for you.
You got your kids.
Yeah, but a wife.
I mean, I just think it's great that you and andie

Yeah, well, it ain't easy.
Well, at least you did it.

No, but I envy you.

It's a brick of Viagra.

Oh, my God.
Yeah, she ordered on-line, you know.
I feel bad, she's lonely.
She's gorgeous,
I don't want to be with anybody else,
But, you know, some nights...
I don't know.
I'd just rather have a burger and hit the sack.
Yeah, we started counseling
And every other night
I stick a wooden medicated boner in her
And now just-- we sit around waiting to see
Who's gonna die first.
That's about it.
Jesus Christ, Nick.
I mean, we're getting old, Lou.
I mean, we can't have kids anymore.
Um...
I don't know.
At one point, one of us is gonna leave the other behind.
( sighing )
Oh, jeez.
I guess this is where the letter "c"
Comes for her dialysis.
( laughing )
Sorry about your hand, man.
It's all right, I don't jerk off anymore
And I can lift the toilet seat with the other one.
I'm fine.
I'm sorry I called you a nazi.
Don't worry about it, faggot.
Uh...
Hey, seriously, man.
You got your kids, you're lucky.
I'm happy for you, really.
Thanks, Nick.
Remember when we were in our 20s,
We used to come home this late 'cause we were out getting laid?
We never got laid.
( laughing )
( Louie ) I remember one time I was with a friend of mine
Who lives in New York also,
And we went to go pick up his cousin--
She lives on a farm in new Hampshire her whole life.
Her family is this weird family that kept her kids on a farm.
Anyway, her parents finally died, so she got to leave,
And so she came down to visit her cousin,
My friend in the city,
And so we picked her up at port authority bus station.
She had never been to any city before
And we're picking her up at the port authority,
That smelly hole of a place.
And we pick her up there and she's just freaking out
At New York.
She's never seen anything like it.
And we pass this homeless guy and she sees him--
I mean, we all passed him, but she saw him.
She's the only one who actually saw him.
We didn't-- me and her cousin were like, "so?
"he's supposed to be there.
"so what?
"there's a perfectly good reason why that's not me and it's him.
The right people always win, I'm sure of it."
But, so there he is,
And this dude was particularly homeless.
He was one of those high-octane homeless,
Smelly, just piss smell,
The unbelievable piss smell, just--
He was piss.
He didn't just smell like piss, he was--
When you piss, he comes out.
That's what-- that's how much...
I don't know if he had gathered it for warmth
Or folks just went, "ek," all day.
( crowd laughing )
And he had dreadlocks.
Not hacky sack, cool-guy, medical-marijuana dreadlocks,
Just "human-neglect clumps" of hair.
A clump of hair for every year
That no one knew his name or cared.
Yeah, that's who you've been laughing at
For the last ten minutes.
That's how bad it was.
And again, me and my friend were just like, "hmph."
His cousin immediately just gets--
She's like, "oh, my God !"
She takes a knee.
That's how-
- I mean, I'm not even taking a real knee now,
That's how little I give a shit about the guy.
He's not even here and I'm still like,
"hmph, yeah, that's close enough."
She goes, "oh, my God, sir, are you okay?
What happened ?"
"what happened ?"
America happened.
What do you mean, "what happened ?"
So she's down there-- "sir, can we call someone ?"
And me and my friend, we're from New York,
This is the crazy part, we immediately go to her,
"oh, no, no, no, honey, don't..."
We start correcting her behavior
Like she's doing something wrong.
She's like, "why, is he okay ?"
"no, no, he needs you desperately,
"that's not the point.
"we just don't do that here.
You silly country girl."
( crowd laughing )
Hello?
Louie?
Hi, it's doctor Ben.
Hey, what's up man?
Yeah, yeah, how are you?
Um...
Look...
I got back your blood work.
Yeah?
Yeah, listen.
I'm sorry about being an arse...
By the way, um...
Te thing is I need you to come back here to do some more tests.
What...
What for?
Well, your blood work shows... that... you may have... slight... big fat... gingi-ugly-itis...
Oh, my God, you're such a dick.
No, um, you've got AIDS.
That's why I thought I need prove, but don't worry, the cancer is gonna eventually kill the AIDS before... it kills you quite slowly and... and painfully.
No, no...
You do have cancer, though.
Loads of it.
In your scrotum.
Um, in fact, that's all there is in the scrotum.
No balls at all, just two healthy lumps of cancer replaced the horrible *** bollocks in there.
And that's gonna... kill you as well, so um...
By the way, the AIDS shows um, this very... extensive shows that you... got the AIDS from raping a little blind boy...

( crowd applauding )
Thank you.
Thank you, everybody.
Nice to be here.
I feel pretty good today.
You know why I feel good?
'cause I-- finally, I have the body that I want,
And that's a thing people really covet.
It's a hard thing to achieve, and I did.
And I'm gonna tell you how
To have exactly the body that you want.
You just have to want...
A shitty body.
That's all it is.
You have to want your own shitty,
Ugly...
Disgusting body.
I don't, though, like being those things all the time.
I get really sweaty all the time.
I-- and that's also bad for sex, 'cause I just sweat--
I just rain sweat all over people.
Like, I'm like, "oh !"
And that's what I'm like when I have sex.
I go, "uhhh!
"uhhh!
Uhhh !"
And I always see her and she's like, just--
Just sweat is pouring off my head and she's like,
"dude, you're limiting my enjoyment by a lot."
( crowd laughing )
N ) no.
Well, then you can call for an appointment.
The results from that test
Don't come in until tomorrow.
No, I have no way of knowing the results
Before they get here.
Yes?
I'm here to see Ben, Dr. Mitchell.
Okay, what time is your appointment
And what is your name?
My name's Louie c.K. And he said to be here around 2:00.
"he said"?
The doctor doesn't make appointments.
Oh, well, see, I know him.
We-
- I used to-- we went to high school together
And I talked to him on the phone.
He said that I could come by.
He didn't put your name in the book
And he didn't tell me, so you don't have an appointment.
Can you check with him?
He's with a patient.
Okay, well, I'll just wait and--
Sir, you don't have an appointment.
Yeah, no, I get that,
But can you just let me wait until he comes out and--
You can't just sit in here
If you don't have an appointment.
Do people, like, come here and steal medical treatment?
Do they steal it from you?
Is that what happens?
'cause why can't you just let me wait--
( men ) so just keep up that regime
And you will start feeling better very soon.
Thanks, doctor.
No problem.
Hey, Ben, how you doing?
You told me to come by, remember?
Do I know you?
( snickering ) uh...
Come through.
It's fine, Priscilla.
Louie c.K. Hey, listen, I didn't mean to
Jump ahead of that woman if she was waiting.
Don't worry, she's...
She's dying.
Yeah, no hope-- really sad.
She has cancer
From her vagina up to her eyeballs.
So I'm just squeezing her for a little extra insurance money
Man, that's not funny.
Oh, God, how are you?
I'm, uh--
I feel like shit.
Feel like shit?
Are you sure you feel like shit and not diarrhea?
'cause you look like diarrhea.
It looks like someone poured diarrhea
Into a face-shaped mold.
( chuckling ) could you stop?
'cause I really am-- I'm worried.
I don't know what's up with me.
Look up.
Okay.
I know what's wrong with you.
What?
Aids.
( cackling )
I can't believe you're a doctor.
Strip down to your underpants.
Let's take a look at you.
Let's take a look at you.
Jesus.
That is-- you don't need a doctor,
You need a time machine.
Did no one tell you that tits
Are meant to be on women, not men?
What is that?
Come on, man.
( giggling ) this is a nightmare.
Get up here.
Oh, dear.
Okay.
Take a deep breath and hold it.
( inhaling )
So how do you feel, really?
Apart from the tumor I can hear in your lungs?
( cackling )
You're an asshole.
Strip all the way down.
Oh, God, Louie.
How can-- that is...
Really bad.
That's the worst penis I've ever seen in my life.
That is disgusting.
It's--
Oh, my God.
This is the worst thing that's ever happened to me,
Seeing that,
And my dad hung himself in front of me
Whilst masturbating.
But if I could take one of those things back,
It would be seeing that awful cock.
It looks like you've been getting a dog to suck it off,
But it chewed it like it thought it was
A horrible old blood-and-cum-filled shoe.
Nurse, can you come here a minute?
I'm serious.
That is the worst penis
Probably in the world.
Nurse?
Honestly, is that not the ugliest penis
You've ever seen in your life?
Yes, doctor, it's very ugly.
Very ugly, very ugly.
She's a nurse, so--
Stop it.
Come on, man.
What worries me is, if that's your penis and testicles,
What's your anus gonna be like?
But we're not gonna find that out.
We are gonna find out because I need to give you
A full rectal examination.
No, no, no way.
Yes way.
You're over 40, Louie, okay?
No more wanking around.
This could save your life.
Okay, all right.
Come on.
Look, it's not very pleasant,
But it's necessary.
Okay, all right.
Okay, and I'll be as gentle as I can.
Thank you.
( groaning ) sorry.
Is that okay?
Yeah, it's okay.
How about that?
Yeah, that's all right.
What about this?
Jesus Christ!
What?
This is serious.
What's wrong with you?
This is serious.
There's no way it's supposed to go in and out like that.
Well, it can do.
I'm a doctor.
Yeah!
And it tells me that everything is fine up there.
Jesus.
Listen, I'm still going with aids,
But let's do some blood work and find out.
My days start poorly, 'cause of the shape I'm in.
Because now, also, I'm 42, so I'm getting-
- I'm get--
I'm really on the decline.
There's never gonna be another year of my life
That was better than the year before.
That's never gonna happen again!
I've seen my best years.
And when I wake up in the morning,
I just-
- I'm-
- I just sit there and I'm like,
"oh..."
It's an awful way to start your day.
Every day starts with me, like, my eyes open
And I reload the program of misery.
I just open eyes,
Remember who I am,
What I'm like...
And I go, "ugh.
"I guess.
"I guess do it.
"I don't know.
I guess-- oh, my God."
Somebody called me an Indian giver recently.
I don't know if you've heard that expression
Since you were kids,
But I remember we used to call each other--
"Indian giver" is one of the most offensive things
You could ever-- because what it's meant to be
Is that someone gave you something
And then they changed their minds.
That makes you an Indian giver.
And we equate this to the indians
Because our feeling is that they gave us America,
And then they--
Well, they didn't take it back, certainly,
But they chang
Which is that we got here and the indians were like, "hi."
And we were like, "hey, can we have everything ?"
And they were like, "well, we don't know what 'have' means,
But enjoy all the things that you need, like we do."
So we start killing all of them.
And they were like, "oh, dude,
"could you not do that part where you kill all of us?
'cause that's kind of a drag for us."
And we're like, "you guys are Indian givers!
"oh, my God!
"we're gonna name that after you.
You guys are dicks !"
Anyway, thanks a lot, folks, good night.
( applauding )
We're gonna keep this show going,
We're gonna bring the next comic up.
Very funny guy, you guys might know him.
Nick DiPaolo.
( cheering )
Whoa!
How about a hand for the emcee, going through chemo, huh?
All right.
Poor prick-- skinny, no hair.
How are you?
Welcome to the basement of al-qaeda's hideout and...
You think I'm kidding?
Those aren't Irish guys making your falafel
In the kitchen upstairs.
How's it going?
It's a shitty night tonight.
I have two tables, all black people,
So I know I'm not making no tips.
Are you being serious right now?
Yeah, look over there.
I have two tables, they're all black.
I'm working for free tonight.
No, I mean, are you being seriously that racist?
What?
You don't know that they're not gonna tip you.
Yes, I do.
Just 'cause they're black?
I've been waiting tables for five years,
I never got a tip from a black person, not once.
First of all, I don't believe you.
Second of all, that's still racist.
I am not racist.
Screw you.
What are you talking about?
She says black people don't tip.
Are you nuts?
Niggas don't tip.
Everyone knows that.
Have you ever waited tables before?
No.
Then shut up, asshole.
I'm getting old.
This is how I know I'm getting old.
I actually pulled a muscle in my neck
Giving my wife the finger behind her back.
( laughing )
That's a true story.
We're having a fight, she walked out of the kitchen,
I went-
- Ahh!
Like that.
Weird things are happening to my body as I get older.
Ever hold a piss so long it turns into a shit?
That didn't happen when I was in high school.
.
Ooh, listen to that silence, huh?
Holy shit, I hit you right in
The "white guilt" muscle, didn't I?
I mean, can we quit calling Obama
The first black president?
My nipples are darker than Barack Obama.
They're so in love with this guy.
They want to give him his own national holiday, Barack?
He hasn't even been shot yet.
( crowd ) ooh...
This is perfect, they hate my guts.
All right.
People are such hypocrites down there.
I'm sure you did better at the Hitler youth rally.
Ha-ha, liberal fag.
Yeah, okay, himmler.
Why don't you just go eat out Obama's asshole?
I would.
I mean, I'm not gay, but just to be part of history.
Country's going to shit.
You know, you Republicans are such babies.
You've had your way for eight years,
Why can't you just give somebody else a try?
Because it's a bullshit sham, that's why.
He's in there because of white guilt
And affirmative action.
And anybody who has the balls to say that out loud
Is called a nazi by deluded assholes like you.
Poor little nazis don't like being called nazis.
I'm sorry.
Can you guys stop having this conversation?
You know, when bush was in office,
Every time you put on the news,
All you saw was black people, gays, liberals
Just pissing and moaning at how bad he was.
Nobody-- but now Obama's in there, no one can say shit.
You know, if it's like you say it is
And it's your turn, then how--
Why don't we get a say in it, like you did?
I mean, a white guy doesn't have a voice
In this country anymore.
Are we supposed to feel sorry for white guys?
What, is 10,000 years of unchecked prosperity,
That's not enough for you?
No, it's not, give me 20.
Well, how about 30?
Yeah.
And then you can celebrate with a big parade of soldiers
And have white columns with an eagle,
Maybe some red banners with a white circle
And have something like this going in the middle of it?
The nazi thing again?
Is that all you got?
Yeah, well, that's what-- it's the same thing--
What is it, what?
It's one group--
Come up with a different argument.
... Get what they want over everyone else.
Over, over--
What the ( bleep ) is wrong with you?
What the ( bleep ) is wrong with you?
What the ( bleep ) is wrong with you?
You pretend you're kidding, but you really mean it.
My father fought those nazis, okay?
So if you call me that again,
I'm gonna punch you in the face!
All right, I won't call you that,
You Hitler nazi piece of shit!
( bleep )
Come on.
Get off me!
Get the ( bleep ) off me!
You cut my hand.
Goddamnit.
Nice.
Jeez, man, it looks bad.
Yeah, it does, doesn't it?
( woman on loudspeaker ) dr.
Green, telephone, please.
Dr. Green, telephone, please.
How long they gonna make you wait?
I ink the guy they're working on now
Has a musket wound.
Got blindsided by a model t.
I heard he got stepped on by a dinosaur.
At least you got that dirty jizz rag there
Seeping germs into your wound.
I think I saw the bartender spit into it
And wipe up some aids vomit.
God.
So how are the kids?
Good.
They're at my place.
Babysitter.
They'll be waking me up in about four hours.
Must be nice.
( cell phone ringing )
Oh, it's andie.
Hello, hey, babe.
Yeah, no.
I'm out.
Nothing.
Yeah, no, try to get some sleep.
All right, you too.
Bye.
You didn't tell her where you are?
She's gonna start worrying, what's the use?
Must be nice having somebody at home worrying for you.
You got your kids.
Yeah, but a wife.
I mean, I just think it's great that you and andie
Made it work, you know?
You've been together, what, 15 years?
Yeah, well, it ain't easy.
Well, at least you did it.
Miss your wife?
No, but I envy you.
The other day, I get a package in the mail, right?
It's from India.
I'm like, what the hell's this shit?
So I open it up.
It's a brick of Viagra.
I look over at andie, she's grinning.
Oh, my God.
Yeah, she ordered on-line, you know.
I feel bad, she's lonely.
She's gorgeous,
I don't want to be with anybody else,
But, you know, some nights...
I don't know.
I'd just rather have a burger and hit the sack.
Yeah, we started counseling
And every other night
I stick a wooden medicated boner in her
And now just-- we sit around waiting to see
Who's gonna die first.
That's about it.
Jesus Christ, Nick.
I mean, we're getting old, Lou.
I mean, we can't have kids anymore.
Um...
I don't know.
At one point, one of us is gonna leave the other behind.
( sighing )
Oh, jeez.
I guess this is where the letter "c"
Comes for her dialysis.
( laughing )
Sorry about your hand, man.
It's all right, I don't jerk off anymore
And I can lift the toilet seat with the other one.
I'm fine.
I'm sorry I called you a nazi.
Don't worry about it, faggot.
Uh...
Hey, seriously, man.
You got your kids, you're lucky.
I'm happy for you, really.
Thanks, Nick.
Remember when we were in our 20s,
We used to come home this late 'cause we were out getting laid?
We never got laid.
( laughing )
( Louie ) I remember one time I was with a friend of mine
Who lives in New York also,
And we went to go pick up his cousin--
She lives on a farm in new Hampshire her whole life.
Her family is this weird family that kept her kids on a farm.
Anyway, her parents finally died, so she got to leave,
And so she came down to visit her cousin,
My friend in the city,
And so we picked her up at port authority bus station.
She had never been to any city before
And we're picking her up at the port authority,
That smelly hole of a place.
And we pick her up there and she's just freaking out
At New York.
She's never seen anything like it.
And we pass this homeless guy and she sees him--
I mean, we all passed him, but she saw him.
She's the only one who actually saw him.
We didn't-- me and her cousin were like, "so?
"he's supposed to be there.
"so what?
"there's a perfectly good reason why that's not me and it's him.
The right people always win, I'm sure of it."
But, so there he is,
And this dude was particularly homeless.
He was one of those high-octane homeless,
Smelly, just piss smell,
The unbelievable piss smell, just--
He was piss.
He didn't just smell like piss, he was--
When you piss, he comes out.
That's what-- that's how much...
I don't know if he had gathered it for warmth
Or folks just went, "ek," all day.
( crowd laughing )
And he had dreadlocks.
Not hacky sack, cool-guy, medical-marijuana dreadlocks,
Just "human-neglect clumps" of hair.
A clump of hair for every year
That no one knew his name or cared.
Yeah, that's who you've been laughing at
For the last ten minutes.
That's how bad it was.
And again, me and my friend were just like, "hmph."
His cousin immediately just gets--
She's like, "oh, my God !"
She takes a knee.
That's how-
- I mean, I'm not even taking a real knee now,
That's how little I give a shit about the guy.
He's not even here and I'm still like,
"hmph, yeah, that's close enough."
She goes, "oh, my God, sir, are you okay?
What happened ?"
"what happened ?"
America happened.
What do you mean, "what happened ?"
So she's down there-- "sir, can we call someone ?"
And me and my friend, we're from New York,
This is the crazy part, we immediately go to her,
"oh, no, no, no, honey, don't..."
We start correcting her behavior
Like she's doing something wrong.
She's like, "why, is he okay ?"
"no, no, he needs you desperately,
"that's not the point.
"we just don't do that here.
You silly country girl."
( crowd laughing )
Hello?
Louie?
Hi, it's doctor Ben.
Hey, what's up man?
Yeah, yeah, how are you?
Um...
Look...
I got back your blood work.
Yeah?
Yeah, listen.

"I guess.
"I guess do it.
"I don't know.
I guess-- oh, my God."
Somebody called me an Indian giver recently.
I don't know if you've heard that expression
Since you were kids,
But I remember we used to call each other--
"Indian giver" is one of the most offensive things
You could ever-- because what it's meant to be
Is that someone gave you something
And then they changed their minds.
That makes you an Indian giver.
And we equate this to the indians
Because our feeling is that they gave us America,
And then they--
Well, they didn't take it back, certainly,
But they chang
Which is that we got here and the indians were like, "hi."
And we were like, "hey, can we have everything ?"
And they were like, "well, we don't know what 'have' means,
But enjoy all the things that you need, like we do."
So we start killing all of them.
And they were like, "oh, dude,
"could you not do that part where you kill all of us?
'cause that's kind of a drag for us."
And we're like, "you guys are Indian givers!
"oh, my God!
"we're gonna name that after you.
You guys are dicks !"
Anyway, thanks a lot, folks, good night.
We're gonna keep this show going,
We're gonna bring the next comic up.
Very funny guy, you guys might know him.
Nick DiPaolo.
Whoa!
How about a hand for the emcee, going through chemo, huh?
All right.
Poor prick-- skinny, no hair.
How are you?
Welcome to the basement of al-qaeda's hideout and...
You think I'm kidding?
Those aren't Irish guys making your falafel
In the kitchen upstairs.
How's it going?
It's a shitty night tonight.
I have two tables, all black people,
So I know I'm not making no tips.
Are you being serious right now?
Yeah, look over there.
I have two tables, they're all black.
I'm working for free tonight.
No, I mean, are you being seriously that racist?
What?
You don't know that they're not gonna tip you.
Yes, I do.
Just 'cause they're black?
I've been waiting tables for five years,
I never got a tip from a black person, not once.
First of all, I don't believe you.
Second of all, that's still racist.
I am not racist.
Screw you.
What are you talking about?
She says black people don't tip.
Are you nuts?
Niggas don't tip.
Everyone knows that.
Have you ever waited tables before?
No.
Then shut up, asshole.
I'm getting old.
This is how I know I'm getting old.
I actually pulled a muscle in my neck
Giving my wife the finger behind her back.
That's a true story.
We're having a fight, she walked out of the kitchen,
I went-
- Ahh!
Like that.
Weird things are happening to my body as I get older.
Ever hold a piss so long it turns into a shit?
That didn't happen when I was in high school.
.
Ooh, listen to that silence, huh?
Holy shit, I hit you right in
The "white guilt" muscle, didn't I?
I mean, can we quit calling Obama
The first black president?
My nipples are darker than Barack Obama.
They're so in love with this guy.
They want to give him his own national holiday, Barack?
He hasn't even been shot yet.
Ooh...
This is perfect, they hate my guts.
All right.
People are such hypocrites down there.
I'm sure you did better at the Hitler youth rally.
Ha-ha, liberal fag.
Yeah, okay, himmler.
Why don't you just go eat out Obama's asshole?
I would.
I mean, I'm not gay, but just to be part of history.
Country's going to shit.
You know, you Republicans are such babies.
You've had your way for eight years,
Why can't you just give somebody else a try?
Because it's a bullshit sham, that's why.
He's in there because of white guilt
And affirmative action.
And anybody who has the balls to say that out loud
Is called a nazi by deluded assholes like you.
Poor little nazis don't like being called nazis.
I'm sorry.
Can you guys stop having this conversation?
You know, when bush was in office,
Every time you put on the news,
All you saw was black people, gays, liberals
Just pissing and moaning at how bad he was.
Nobody-- but now Obama's in there, no one can say shit.
You know, if it's like you say it is
And it's your turn, then how--
Why don't we get a say in it, like you did?
I mean, a white guy doesn't have a voice
In this country anymore.
Are we supposed to feel sorry for white guys?
What, is 10,000 years of unchecked prosperity,
That's not enough for you?
No, it's not, give me 20.
Well, how about 30?
Yeah.
And then you can celebrate with a big parade of soldiers
And have white columns with an eagle,
Maybe some red banners with a white circle
And have something like this going in the middle of it?
The nazi thing again?
Is that all you got?
Yeah, well, that's what-- it's the same thing--
What is it, what?
It's one group--
Come up with a different argument.
... Get what they want over everyone else.
Over, over--
What the ( bleep ) is wrong with you?
What the ( bleep ) is wrong with you?
What the ( bleep ) is wrong with you?
You pretend you're kidding, but you really mean it.
My father fought those nazis, okay?
So if you call me that again,
I'm gonna punch you in the face!
All right, I won't call you that,
You Hitler nazi piece of shit!
Come on.
Get off me!
Get the ( bleep ) off me!
You cut my hand.
Goddamnit.
Nice.
Jeez, man, it looks bad.
Yeah, it does, doesn't it?
Dr. Green, telephone, please.
Dr. Green, telephone, please.
How long they gonna make you wait?
I ink the guy they're working on now
Has a musket wound.
Got blindsided by a model t.
I heard he got stepped on by a dinosaur.
At least you got that dirty jizz rag there
Seeping germs into your wound.
I think I saw the bartender spit into it
And wipe up some aids vomit.
God.
So how are the kids?
Good.
They're at my place.
Babysitter.
They'll be waking me up in about four hours.
Must be nice.
Oh, it's andie.
Hello, hey, babe.
Yeah, no.
I'm out.
Nothing.
Yeah, no, try to get some sleep.
All right, you too.
Bye.
You didn't tell her where you are?
She's gonna start worrying, what's the use?
Must be nice having somebody at home worrying for you.
You got your kids.
Yeah, but a wife.
I mean, I just think it's great that you and andie
Made it work, you know?
You've been together, what, 15 years?
Yeah, well, it ain't easy.
Well, at least you did it.
Miss your wife?
No, but I envy you.
The other day, I get a package in the mail, right?
It's from India.
I'm like, what the hell's this shit?
So I open it up.
It's a brick of Viagra.
I look over at andie, she's grinning.
Oh, my God.
Yeah, she ordered on-line, you know.
I feel bad, she's lonely.
She's gorgeous,
I don't want to be with anybody else,
But, you know, some nights...
I don't know.
I'd just rather have a burger and hit the sack.
Yeah, we started counseling
And every other night
I stick a wooden medicated boner in her
And now just-- we sit around waiting to see
Who's gonna die first.
That's about it.
Jesus Christ, Nick.
I mean, we're getting old, Lou.
I mean, we can't have kids anymore.
Um...
I don't know.
At one point, one of us is gonna leave the other behind.
Oh, jeez.
I guess this is where the letter "c"
Comes for her dialysis.
Sorry about your hand, man.
It's all right, I don't jerk off anymore
And I can lift the toilet seat with the other one.
I'm fine.
I'm sorry I called you a nazi.
Don't worry about it, faggot.
Uh...
Hey, seriously, man.
You got your kids, you're lucky.
I'm happy for you, really.
Thanks, Nick.
Remember when we were in our 20s,
We used to come home this late 'cause we were out getting laid?
We never got laid.
I remember one time I was with a friend of mine
Who lives in New York also,
And we went to go pick up his cousin--
She lives on a farm in new Hampshire her whole life.
Her family is this weird family that kept her kids on a farm.
Anyway, her parents finally died, so she got to leave,
And so she came down to visit her cousin,
My friend in the city,
And so we picked her up at port authority bus station.
She had never been to any city before
And we're picking her up at the port authority,
That smelly hole of a place.
And we pick her up there and she's just freaking out
At New York.
She's never seen anything like it.
And we pass this homeless guy and she sees him--
I mean, we all passed him, but she saw him.
She's the only one who actually saw him.
We didn't-- me and her cousin were like, "so?
"he's supposed to be there.
"so what?
"there's a perfectly good reason why that's not me and it's him.
The right people always win, I'm sure of it."
But, so there he is,
And this dude was particularly homeless.
He was one of those high-octane homeless,
Smelly, just piss smell,
The unbelievable piss smell, just--
He was piss.
He didn't just smell like piss, he was--
When you piss, he comes out.
That's what-- that's how much...
I don't know if he had gathered it for warmth
Or folks just went, "ek," all day.
And he had dreadlocks.
Not hacky sack, cool-guy, medical-marijuana dreadlocks,
Just "human-neglect clumps" of hair.
A clump of hair for every year
That no one knew his name or cared.
Yeah, that's who you've been laughing at
For the last ten minutes.
That's how bad it was.
And again, me and my friend were just like, "hmph."
His cousin immediately just gets--
She's like, "oh, my God !"
She takes a knee.
That's how-
- I mean, I'm not even taking a real knee now,
That's how little I give a shit about the guy.
He's not even here and I'm still like,
"hmph, yeah, that's close enough."
She goes, "oh, my God, sir, are you okay?
What happened ?"
"what happened ?"
America happened.
What do you mean, "what happened ?"
So she's down there-- "sir, can we call someone ?"
And me and my friend, we're from New York,
This is the crazy part, we immediately go to her,
"oh, no, no, no, honey, don't..."
We start correcting her behavior
Like she's doing something wrong.
She's like, "why, is he okay ?"
"no, no, he needs you desperately,
"that's not the point.
"we just don't do that here.
You silly country girl."
Hello?
Louie?
Hi, it's doctor Ben.
Hey, what's up man?
Yeah, yeah, how are you?
Um...
Look...
I got back your blood work.
Yeah?
Yeah, listen.
I'm sorry about being an arse...
By the way, um...
Te thing is I need you to come back here to do some more tests.
What...
What for?
Well, your blood work shows... that... you may have... slight... big fat... gingi-ugly-itis...
Oh, my God, you're such a dick.
No, um, you've got AIDS.
That's why I thought I need prove, but don't worry, the cancer is gonna eventually kill the AIDS before... it kills you quite slowly and... and painfully.
No, no...
You do have cancer, though.
Loads of it.
In your scrotum.
Um, in fact, that's all there is in the scrotum.
No balls at all, just two healthy lumps of cancer replaced the horrible *** bollocks in there.
And that's gonna... kill you as well, so um...
By the way, the AIDS shows um, this very... extensive shows that you... got the AIDS from raping a little blind boy...
Louie...
♪ Louie, Louie, Louie, Louie ♪
♪ Louie, Louie Louie, louaaa ♪
♪ Louie, Louie, Louie, Louie ♪
♪ Louie, Louie you're gonna cry ♪
♪ Louie, Louie, Louie, Louie ♪
Thank you.
Thank you, everybody.
Nice to be here.
I feel pretty good today.
You know why I feel good?
'cause I-- finally, I have the body that I want,
And that's a thing people really covet.
It's a hard thing to achieve, and I did.
And I'm gonna tell you how
To have exactly the body that you want.
You just have to want...
A shitty body.
That's all it is.
You have to want your own shitty,
Ugly...
Disgusting body.
I don't, though, like being those things all the time.
I get really sweaty all the time.
I-- and that's also bad for sex, 'cause I just sweat--
I just rain sweat all over people.
Like, I'm like, "oh !"
And that's what I'm like when I have sex.
I go, "uhhh!
"uhhh!
Uhhh !"
And I always see her and she's like, just--
Just sweat is pouring off my head and she's like,
"dude, you're limiting my enjoyment by a lot."
N ) no.
Well, then you can call for an appointment.
The results from that test
Don't come in until tomorrow.
No, I have no way of knowing the results
Before they get here.
Yes?
And what is your name?
My name's Louie c.K. And he said to be here around 2:00.
"he said"?
The doctor doesn't make appointments.
Oh, well, see, I know him.
We-
- I used to-- we went to high school together
And I talked to him on the phone.
He said that I could come by.
He didn't put your name in the book
And he didn't tell me, so you don't have an appointment.
Can you check with him?
He's with a patient.
Okay, well, I'll just wait and--
Sir, you don't have an appointment.
Yeah, no, I get that,
But can you just let me wait until he comes out and--
You can't just sit in here
If you don't have an appointment.
Do people, like, come here and steal medical treatment?
Do they steal it from you?
Is that what happens?
'cause why can't you just let me wait-- so just keep up that regime
And you will start feeling better very soon.
Thanks, doctor.
No problem.
Hey, Ben, how you doing?
You told me to come by, remember?
Do I know you?
Uh...
Come through.
It's fine, Priscilla.
Louie c.K. Hey, listen, I didn't mean to
Jump ahead of that woman if she was waiting.
Don't worry, she's...
She's dying.
Yeah, no hope-- really sad.
She has cancer
From her vagina up to her eyeballs.
So I'm just squeezing her for a little extra insurance money
Man, that's not funny.
Oh, God, how are you?
I'm, uh--
I feel like shit.
Feel like shit?
Are you sure you feel like shit and not diarrhea?
'cause you look like diarrhea.
It looks like someone poured diarrhea
Into a face-shaped mold.
Could you stop?
'cause I really am-- I'm worried.
I don't know what's up with me.
Look up.
Okay.
I know what's wrong with you.
What?
Aids.
I can't believe you're a doctor.
Strip down to your underpants.
Let's take a look at you.
Let's take a look at you.
Jesus.
That is-- you don't need a doctor,
You need a time machine.
Did no one tell you that tits
Are meant to be on women, not men?
What is that?
Come on, man.
This is a nightmare.
Get up here.
Oh, dear.
Okay.
Take a deep breath and hold it.
So how do you feel, really?
Apart from the tumor I can hear in your lungs?
You're an asshole.
Strip all the way down.
Oh, God, Louie.
How can-- that is...
Really bad.
That's the worst penis I've ever seen in my life.
That is disgusting.
It's--
Oh, my God.
This is the worst thing that's ever happened to me,
Seeing that,
And my dad hung himself in front of me
Whilst masturbating.
But if I could take one of those things back,
It would be seeing that awful cock.
It looks like you've been getting a dog to suck it off,
But it chewed it like it thought it was
A horrible old blood-and-cum-filled shoe.
Nurse, can you come here a minute?
I'm serious.
That is the worst penis
Probably in the world.
Nurse?
Honestly, is that not the ugliest penis
You've ever seen in your life?
Yes, doctor, it's very ugly.
Very ugly, very ugly.
She's a nurse, so--
Stop it.
Come on, man.
What worries me is, if that's your penis and testicles,
What's your anus gonna be like?
But we're not gonna find that out.
We are gonna find out because I need to give you
A full rectal examination.
No, no, no way.
Yes way.
You're over 40, Louie, okay?
No more wanking around.
This could save your life.
Okay, all right.
Come on.
Look, it's not very pleasant,
But it's necessary.
Okay, all right.
Okay, and I'll be as gentle as I can.
Thank you.
Sorry.
Is that okay?
Yeah, it's okay.
How about that?
Yeah, that's all right.
What about this?
Jesus Christ!
What?
This is serious.
What's wrong with you?
This is serious.
There's no way it's supposed to go in and out like that.
Well, it can do.
I'm a doctor.
Yeah!
And it tells me that everything is fine up there.
Jesus.
Listen, I'm still going with aids,
But let's do some blood work and find out.
My days start poorly, 'cause of the shape I'm in.
Because now, also, I'm 42, so I'm getting-
- I'm get--
I'm really on the decline.
There's never gonna be another year of my life
That was better than the year before.
That's never gonna happen again!
I've seen my best years.
And when I wake up in the morning,
I just-
- I'm-
- I just sit there and I'm like,
"oh..."
It's an awful way to start your day.
Every day starts with me, like, my eyes open
And I reload the program of misery.
I just open eyes,
Remember who I am,
What I'm like...
And I go, "ugh.
"I guess.
"I guess do it.
"I don't know.
I guess-- oh, my God."
Somebody called me an Indian giver recently.

Whoa!
How about a hand for the emcee, going through chemo, huh?
All right.
Poor prick-- skinny, no hair.
How are you?
Welcome to the basement of al-qaeda's hideout and...
You think I'm kidding?
Those aren't Irish guys making your falafel
In the kitchen upstairs.
How's it going?
It's a shitty night tonight.

What?
You don't know that they're not gonna tip you.
Yes, I do.

I've been waiting tables for five years,
I never got a tip from a black person, not once.
First of all, I don't believe you.
Second of all, that's still racist.
I am not racist.
Screw you.
What are you talking about?
She says black people don't tip.
Are you nuts?

At New York.
She's never seen anything like it.
And we pass this homeless guy and she sees him--
I mean, we all passed him, but she saw him.
She's the only one who actually saw him.
We didn't-- me and her cousin were like, "so?
"he's supposed to be there.
"so what?
"there's a perfectly good reason why that's not me and it's him.
The right people always win, I'm sure of it."
But, so there he is,
And this dude was particularly homeless.
He was one of those high-octane homeless,
Smelly, just piss smell,
The unbelievable piss smell, just--
He was piss.
He didn't just smell like piss, he was--
When you piss, he comes out.
That's what-- that's how much...
I don't know if he had gathered it for warmth
Or folks just went, "ek," all day.
And he had dreadlocks.
Not hacky sack, cool-guy, medical-marijuana dreadlocks,
Just "human-neglect clumps" of hair.
A clump of hair for every year
That no one knew his name or cared.
Yeah, that's who you've been laughing at
For the last ten minutes.
That's how bad it was.
And again, me and my friend were just like, "hmph."
His cousin immediately just gets--
She's like, "oh, my God !"
She takes a knee.
That's how-
- I mean, I'm not even taking a real knee now,
That's how little I give a shit about the guy.
He's not even here and I'm still like,
"hmph, yeah, that's close enough."
She goes, "oh, my God, sir, are you okay?
What happened ?"
"what happened ?"
America happened.
What do you mean, "what happened ?"
So she's down there-- "sir, can we call someone ?"
And me and my friend, we're from New York,
This is the crazy part, we immediately go to her,
"oh, no, no, no, honey, don't..."
We start correcting her behavior
Like she's doing something wrong.
She's like, "why, is he okay ?"
"no, no, he needs you desperately,
"that's not the point.
"we just don't do that here.
You silly country girl."
Hello?
Louie?
Hi, it's doctor Ben.
Hey, what's up man?
Yeah, yeah, how are you?
Um...
Look...
I got back your blood work.
Yeah?
Yeah, listen.
I'm sorry about being an arse...
By the way, um...
Te thing is I need you to come back here to do some more tests.
What...
What for?
Well, your blood work shows... that... you may have... slight... big fat... gingi-ugly-itis...
Oh, my God, you're such a dick.
No, um, you've got AIDS.
That's why I thought I need prove, but don't worry, the cancer is gonna eventually kill the AIDS before... it kills you quite slowly and... and painfully.
No, no...
You do have cancer, though.
Loads of it.
In your scrotum.
Um, in fact, that's all there is in the scrotum.
No balls at all, just two healthy lumps of cancer replaced the horrible *** bollocks in there.
And that's gonna... kill you as well, so um...
By the way, the AIDS shows um, this very... extensive shows that you... got the AIDS from raping a little blind boy...
Louie...

( crowd applauding )
Thank you.
Thank you, everybody.
Nice to be here.
I feel pretty good today.
You know why I feel good?
'cause I-- finally, I have the body that I want,
And that's a thing people really covet.
It's a hard thing to achieve, and I did.
And I'm gonna tell you how
To have exactly the body that you want.
You just have to want...
A shitty body.
That's all it is.
You have to want your own shitty,
Ugly...
Disgusting body.
I don't, though, like being those things all the time.
I get really sweaty all the time.
I-- and that's also bad for sex, 'cause I just sweat--
I just rain sweat all over people.
Like, I'm like, "oh !"
And that's what I'm like when I have sex.
I go, "uhhh!
"uhhh!
Uhhh !"
And I always see her and she's like, just--
Just sweat is pouring off my head and she's like,
"dude, you're limiting my enjoyment by a lot."
( crowd laughing )
N ) no.
Well, then you can call for an appointment.
The results from that test
Don't come in until tomorrow.
No, I have no way of knowing the results
Before they get here.
Yes?
I'm here to see Ben, Dr. Mitchell.
Okay, what time is your appointment
And what is your name?
My name's Louie c.K. And he said to be here around 2:00.
"he said"?
The doctor doesn't make appointments.
Oh, well, see, I know him.
We-
- I used to-- we went to high school together
And I talked to him on the phone.
He said that I could come by.
He didn't put your name in the book
And he didn't tell me, so you don't have an appointment.
Can you check with him?
He's with a patient.
Okay, well, I'll just wait and--
Sir, you don't have an appointment.
Yeah, no, I get that,
But can you just let me wait until he comes out and--
You can't just sit in here
If you don't have an appointment.
Do people, like, come here and steal medical treatment?
Do they steal it from you?
Is that what happens?
'cause why can't you just let me wait--
( men ) so just keep up that regime
And you will start feeling better very soon.
Thanks, doctor.
No problem.
Hey, Ben, how you doing?
You told me to come by, remember?
Do I know you?
( snickering ) uh...
Come through.
It's fine, Priscilla.
Louie c.K. Hey, listen, I didn't mean to
Jump ahead of that woman if she was waiting.
Don't worry, she's...
She's dying.
Yeah, no hope-- really sad.
She has cancer
From her vagina up to her eyeballs.
So I'm just squeezing her for a little extra insurance money
Man, that's not funny.
Oh, God, how are you?
I'm, uh--
I feel like shit.
Feel like shit?
Are you sure you feel like shit and not diarrhea?
'cause you look like diarrhea.
It looks like someone poured diarrhea
Into a face-shaped mold.
( chuckling ) could you stop?
'cause I really am-- I'm worried.
I don't know what's up with me.
Look up.
Okay.
I know what's wrong with you.
What?
Aids.
( cackling )
I can't believe you're a doctor.
Strip down to your underpants.
Let's take a look at you.
Let's take a look at you.
Jesus.
That is-- you don't need a doctor,
You need a time machine.
Did no one tell you that tits
Are meant to be on women, not men?
What is that?
Come on, man.
( giggling ) this is a nightmare.
Get up here.
Oh, dear.
Okay.
Take a deep breath and hold it.
( inhaling )
So how do you feel, really?
Apart from the tumor I can hear in your lungs?
( cackling )
You're an asshole.
Strip all the way down.
Oh, God, Louie.
How can-- that is...
Really bad.
That's the worst penis I've ever seen in my life.
That is disgusting.
It's--
Oh, my God.
This is the worst thing that's ever happened to me,
Seeing that,
And my dad hung himself in front of me
Whilst masturbating.
But if I could take one of those things back,
It would be seeing that awful cock.
It looks like you've been getting a dog to suck it off,
But it chewed it like it thought it was
A horrible old blood-and-cum-filled shoe.
Nurse, can you come here a minute?
I'm serious.
That is the worst penis
Probably in the world.
Nurse?
Honestly, is that not the ugliest penis
You've ever seen in your life?
Yes, doctor, it's very ugly.
Very ugly, very ugly.
She's a nurse, so--
Stop it.
Come on, man.
What worries me is, if that's your penis and testicles,
What's your anus gonna be like?
But we're not gonna find that out.
We are gonna find out because I need to give you
A full rectal examination.
No, no, no way.
Yes way.
You're over 40, Louie, okay?
No more wanking around.
This could save your life.
Okay, all right.
Come on.
Look, it's not very pleasant,
But it's necessary.
Okay, all right.
Okay, and I'll be as gentle as I can.
Thank you.
( groaning ) sorry.
Is that okay?
Yeah, it's okay.
How about that?
Yeah, that's all right.
What about this?
Jesus Christ!
What?
This is serious.
What's wrong with you?
This is serious.
There's no way it's supposed to go in and out like that.
Well, it can do.
I'm a doctor.
Yeah!
And it tells me that everything is fine up there.
Jesus.
Listen, I'm still going with aids,
But let's do some blood work and find out.
My days start poorly, 'cause of the shape I'm in.
Because now, also, I'm 42, so I'm getting-
- I'm get--
I'm really on the decline.
There's never gonna be another year of my life
That was better than the year before.
That's never gonna happen again!
I've seen my best years.
And when I wake up in the morning,
I just-
- I'm-
- I just sit there and I'm like,
"oh..."
It's an awful way to start your day.
Every day starts with me, like, my eyes open
And I reload the program of misery.
I just open eyes,
Remember who I am,
What I'm like...
And I go, "ugh.
"I guess.
"I guess do it.
"I don't know.
I guess-- oh, my God."
Somebody called me an Indian giver recently.
I don't know if you've heard that expression
Since you were kids,
But I remember we used to call each other--
"Indian giver" is one of the most offensive things
You could ever-- because what it's meant to be
Is that someone gave you something
And then they changed their minds.
That makes you an Indian giver.
And we equate this to the indians
Because our feeling is that they gave us America,
And then they--
Well, they didn't take it back, certainly,
But they chang
Which is that we got here and the indians were like, "hi."
And we were like, "hey, can we have everything ?"
And they were like, "well, we don't know what 'have' means,
But enjoy all the things that you need, like we do."
So we start killing all of them.
And they were like, "oh, dude,
"could you not do that part where you kill all of us?
'cause that's kind of a drag for us."
And we're like, "you guys are Indian givers!
"oh, my God!
"we're gonna name that after you.
You guys are dicks !"
Anyway, thanks a lot, folks, good night.
( applauding )
We're gonna keep this show going,
We're gonna bring the next comic up.
Very funny guy, you guys might know him.
Nick DiPaolo.
( cheering )
Whoa!
How about a hand for the emcee, going through chemo, huh?
All right.
Poor prick-- skinny, no hair.
How are you?
Welcome to the basement of al-qaeda's hideout and...
You think I'm kidding?
Those aren't Irish guys making your falafel
In the kitchen upstairs.
How's it going?
It's a shitty night tonight.
I have two tables, all black people,
So I know I'm not making no tips.
Are you being serious right now?
Yeah, look over there.
I have two tables, they're all black.
I'm working for free tonight.
No, I mean, are you being seriously that racist?
What?
You don't know that they're not gonna tip you.
Yes, I do.
Just 'cause they're black?
I've been waiting tables for five years,
I never got a tip from a black person, not once.
First of all, I don't believe you.
Second of all, that's still racist.
I am not racist.
Screw you.
What are you talking about?
She says black people don't tip.
Are you nuts?
Niggas don't tip.
Everyone knows that.
Have you ever waited tables before?
No.
Then shut up, asshole.
I'm getting old.
This is how I know I'm getting old.
I actually pulled a muscle in my neck
Giving my wife the finger behind her back.
( laughing )
That's a true story.
We're having a fight, she walked out of the kitchen,
I went-
- Ahh!
Like that.
Weird things are happening to my body as I get older.
Ever hold a piss so long it turns into a shit?
That didn't happen when I was in high school.
.
Ooh, listen to that silence, huh?
Holy shit, I hit you right in
The "white guilt" muscle, didn't I?
I mean, can we quit calling Obama
The first black president?
My nipples are darker than Barack Obama.
They're so in love with this guy.
They want to give him his own national holiday, Barack?
He hasn't even been shot yet.
( crowd ) ooh...
This is perfect, they hate my guts.
All right.
People are such hypocrites down there.
I'm sure you did better at the Hitler youth rally.
Ha-ha, liberal fag.
Yeah, okay, himmler.
Why don't you just go eat out Obama's asshole?
I would.
I mean, I'm not gay, but just to be part of history.
Country's going to shit.
You know, you Republicans are such babies.
You've had your way for eight years,
Why can't you just give somebody else a try?
Because it's a bullshit sham, that's why.
He's in there because of white guilt
And affirmative action.
And anybody who has the balls to say that out loud
Is called a nazi by deluded assholes like you.
Poor little nazis don't like being called nazis.
I'm sorry.
Can you guys stop having this conversation?
You know, when bush was in office,
Every time you put on the news,
All you saw was black people, gays, liberals
Just pissing and moaning at how bad he was.
Nobody-- but now Obama's in there, no one can say shit.
You know, if it's like you say it is
And it's your turn, then how--
Why don't we get a say in it, like you did?
I mean, a white guy doesn't have a voice
In this country anymore.
Are we supposed to feel sorry for white guys?
What, is 10,000 years of unchecked prosperity,
That's not enough for you?
No, it's not, give me 20.
Well, how about 30?
Yeah.
And then you can celebrate with a big parade of soldiers
And have white columns with an eagle,
Maybe some red banners with a white circle
And have something like this going in the middle of it?
The nazi thing again?
Is that all you got?
Yeah, well, that's what-- it's the same thing--
What is it, what?
It's one group--
Come up with a different argument.
... Get what they want over everyone else.
Over, over--
What the ( bleep ) is wrong with you?
What the ( bleep ) is wrong with you?
What the ( bleep ) is wrong with you?
You pretend you're kidding, but you really mean it.
My father fought those nazis, okay?
So if you call me that again,
I'm gonna punch you in the face!
All right, I won't call you that,
You Hitler nazi piece of shit!
( bleep )
Come on.
Get off me!
Get the ( bleep ) off me!
You cut my hand.
Goddamnit.
Nice.
Jeez, man, it looks bad.
Yeah, it does, doesn't it?
( woman on loudspeaker ) dr.
Green, telephone, please.
Dr. Green, telephone, please.
How long they gonna make you wait?
I ink the guy they're working on now
Has a musket wound.
Got blindsided by a model t.
I heard he got stepped on by a dinosaur.
At least you got that dirty jizz rag there
Seeping germs into your wound.
I think I saw the bartender spit into it
And wipe up some aids vomit.
God.
So how are the kids?
Good.
They're at my place.
Babysitter.
They'll be waking me up in about four hours.
Must be nice.
( cell phone ringing )
Oh, it's andie.
Hello, hey, babe.
Yeah, no.
I'm out.
Nothing.
Yeah, no, try to get some sleep.
All right, you too.
Bye.
You didn't tell her where you are?
She's gonna start worrying, what's the use?
Must be nice having somebody at home worrying for you.
You got your kids.
Yeah, but a wife.
I mean, I just think it's great that you and andie
Made it work, you know?
You've been together, what, 15 years?
Yeah, well, it ain't easy.
Well, at least you did it.
Miss your wife?
No, but I envy you.
The other day, I get a package in the mail, right?
It's from India.
I'm like, what the hell's this shit?
So I open it up.
It's a brick of Viagra.
I look over at andie, she's grinning.
Oh, my God.
Yeah, she ordered on-line, you know.
I feel bad, she's lonely.
She's gorgeous,
I don't want to be with anybody else,
But, you know, some nights...
I don't know.
I'd just rather have a burger and hit the sack.
Yeah, we started counseling
And every other night
I stick a wooden medicated boner in her
And now just-- we sit around waiting to see
Who's gonna die first.
That's about it.
Jesus Christ, Nick.
I mean, we're getting old, Lou.
I mean, we can't have kids anymore.
Um...
I don't know.
At one point, one of us is gonna leave the other behind.
( sighing )
Oh, jeez.
I guess this is where the letter "c"
Comes for her dialysis.
( laughing )
Sorry about your hand, man.
It's all right, I don't jerk off anymore
And I can lift the toilet seat with the other one.
I'm fine.
I'm sorry I called you a nazi.
Don't worry about it, faggot.
Uh...
Hey, seriously, man.
You got your kids, you're lucky.
I'm happy for you, really.
Thanks, Nick.
Remember when we were in our 20s,
We used to come home this late 'cause we were out getting laid?
We never got laid.
( laughing )
( Louie ) I remember one time I was with a friend of mine
Who lives in New York also,
And we went to go pick up his cousin--
She lives on a farm in new Hampshire her whole life.
Her family is this weird family that kept her kids on a farm.
Anyway, her parents finally died, so she got to leave,
And so she came down to visit her cousin,
My friend in the city,
And so we picked her up at port authority bus station.
She had never been to any city before
And we're picking her up at the port authority,
That smelly hole of a place.
And we pick her up there and she's just freaking out
At New York.
She's never seen anything like it.
And we pass this homeless guy and she sees him--
I mean, we all passed him, but she saw him.

This is the crazy part, we immediately go to her,

Louie...
Yοu're live in twο minutes, Yοur Rοyal Highness.
Sir?
Thank yοu.
Let the micrοphοne dο the wοrk, sir.
I'm sure yοu'll be splendid.
Just take yοur time.
Time tο gο.
Gοοd afternοοn.
This is the BBC Natiοnal Prοgramme and Empire Service taking yοu tο Wembley Stadium fοr the clοsing ceremοny οf the Empire Exhibitiοn, where His Royal Highness, the Duke of York, will read a message from his father, His Majesty King George V.
Fifty-eight British colonies and dominions have taken part, making this the largest exhibition staged anywhere in the world.
Remember, sir, three flashes, then steady red means yοu're live.
Using the new invention of radio, the opening ceremony was the first time His Majesty the King addressed his subjects οn the wireless.
At the close of the first season, the heir to the throne, His Royal Highness, the Prince of Wales, made his first broadcast, and today, his yοunger brοther, His Rοyal Highness, the Duke οf Yοrk,
will give his inaugural brοadcast tο the natiοn and the wοrld.
I have received frοm His Majesty the the the King...
Inhale deep intο yοur lungs, Yοur Rοyal Highness.
Relaxes yοur larynx, dοes it nοt?
Cigarette smοking calms the nerves, and gives yοu cοnfidence.
Nοw, if Yοur Rοyal Highness wοuld be sο kind as tο οpen yοur hand.
Sterilized.
One, twο, three, fοur, five, six seven.
Nοw, if I may take the liberty, insert them intο yοur mοuth.
Excuse me, Dοctοr.
What is the purpοse οf this?
It's the classic apprοach.
It cured Demοsthenes.
That was in Ancient Greece.
Has it wοrked since?
Nοw, if yοu wοuld be sο kind as tο read.
"A wealth οf wοrds."
Fight against thοse marbles, Yοur Rοyal Highness.
Enunciate.
A little mοre cοncentratiοn, Yοur Rοyal Highness.
I nearly swallοwed the blοοdy things!
Thank yοu sο much, Dοctοr.
It's been mοst, um interesting.
- Yοur Rοyal Highness.
Insert marbles.
He can insert his οwn blοοdy marbles.
Tick, tοck.
Tick, tοck.
Yοu knοw yοu can't keep dοing this, Bertie.
- I knοw.
- Mmm.
Prοmise me...
Prοmise me nο mοre.
Ah!
Hellο?
- Is anyοne there?
- I'm just in the lοο.
Ah, Mrs. Jοhnsοn, there yοu are.
I'm sοrry, I dοn't have a receptiοnist.
I like tο keep things simple.
"Pοοr and cοntent is rich and rich enοugh."
- I'm sοrry?
- Shakespeare.
Hοw are yοu?
- Hοw dο yοu dο?
- Oh, chuffing alοng.
Um, nοw, this is slightly awkward, but I'm afraid yοu're late.
- Yes.
I'm afraid I am.
- Where's Mr. Jοhnsοn?
Ah...
He dοesn't knοw I'm here.
Well, that's nοt a very prοmising start.
Nο.
Nο, lοοk, my husband has seen everyοne.
Tο nο avail.
I'm awfully afraid he's given up hοpe.
- He hasn't seen me.
- Awfully sure οf yοurself.
Well, I'm sure οf anyοne whο wants tο be cured.
Of cοurse he wants tο be cured.
My husband is, um...
- Well, he's required tο speak publicly.
- Perhaps he shοuld change jοbs.
- He can't.
- Indentured servitude?
Sοmething οf that nature, yes.
Well, we need tο have yοur hubby pοp by.
Uh...
Tuesday wοuld be gοοd.
He can give me his persοnal details, I'll make a frank appraisal
- and then we'll take it frοm there.
- Dοctοr, fοrgive me.
Uh, I dοn't have a "hubby." We dοn't "pοp."
And nοr dο we ever talk abοut οur private lives.
Nο, yοu must cοme tο us.
I'm sοrry, Mrs. Jοhnsοn, my game, my turf, my rules.
Mmm.
Yοu'll have tο talk this οver with yοur husband, and then yοu can speak tο me οn the telephοne.
Thank yοu very much fοr drοpping by.
Gοοd afternοοn.
And what if my husband were the Duke οf Yοrk?
- The Duke οf Yοrk?
- Yes.
The Duke οf Yοrk.
I thοught the appοintment was fοr Jοhnsοn.
Fοrgive me, Yοur...
- Rοyal Highness.
...Rοyal Highness.
Yes, Jοhnsοn was used during the Great War, when the Navy didn't want the enemy
- tο knοw he was abοard.
- Am I cοnsidered the enemy?
Yοu will be, if yοu remain un-οbliging.
Yοu'll appreciate the need fοr absοlute discretiοn.
Of cοurse.
Hοw did yοu find me, Yοur Rοyal Highness?
The President οf The Sοciety Fοr Speech Therapists.
Eileen McCleοd?
She's a spοrt.
She warned me yοur Antipοdean methοds were bοth "unοrthοdοx" and "cοntrοversial."
I warned her thοse are nοt my favοrite wοrds.
I can cure yοur husband.
But fοr my methοd tο wοrk,
I need trust and tοtal equality, here in the safety οf my cοnsultatiοn rοοm.
Nο exceptiοns.
Oh, well.
In that case...
When can yοu start?
- She's still sοunding a bit rοugh.
- Yοu make me drive tοο slοwly, Dad.
- Did yοu pick Mum up frοm bridge?
- Yeah, I've hardly been οut οf the car.
I had a special visitοr this afternοοn.
- May I please leave the table?
- Hοw special's special?
Yοu must stay, bοred stupid, listening tο yοur parents' inane cοnversatiοn.
- Thanks, Dad.
- And Mum.
- And Mum.
- Me, tοο.
- Yοu meeting Jean?
- Nο.
Sοmeοne else.
- Dοctοr?
Dοctοr?
- Hmm?
Gο and help yοur brοther with the washing up.
- I'm fine.
- Whο is it, Liοnel?
Why bring it up if yοu can't talk abοut it?
Myrtle, it's just a wοman lοοking tο help her husband.
Oh, and I had a call... fοr an auditiοn.
- One οf my favοrites.
- Aren't they all?
Cοuld be a lοt οf fun.
I'm sure yοu'll be splendid.
In the amateur scene, they're a highly regarded grοup.
Frοm Putney.
Nο, that's all girls.
Tοmοrrοw, chapter fοur, "The Flight."
Mama, I lοng tο knοw where they fly tο.
- I can't wait!
- Oh, tο fly away.
Weren't they lucky?
Nοw Papa, tell a stοry.
Can't I be a penguin instead?
Well, nο, I want a penguin stοry.
Very quickly.
Once there were...
twο princesses.
Princess Elizabeth and Princess Margaret, whοse papa was a penguin.
This was because he'd been turned intο οne by a wicked witch.
This was very incοnvenient fοr him because he lοved tο hοld his princesses in his arms.
But yοu can't if yοu're a penguin because yοu yοu have wings like herrings.
- Herrings dοn't have wings.
Penguins have wings which are...
are shaped like herrings.
And what made matters wοrse is that she... she sent him tο the Sοuth Pοle, which is an awfully lοng walk back if if yοu can't fly.
Sο when he reached the water, he he dived in, thrοugh the depths, sο fast that he was in Sοuthamptοn Waters by lunchtime.
And frοm there, he tοοk the 2:30 tο Weybridge, changed at Clapham Junctiοn, asked a a passing mallard the way tο Buckingham Palace, swam up The Thames, οut thrοugh the plughοle and gave the cοοk, Mama and Mrs. Whittaker quite a shοck.
Nοw, when the girls heard all the cοmmοtiοn, they ran tο the kitchen, where they gave him a a gοοd scrub, a mackerel and a kiss.
And as they kissed him guess what he turned intο?
- A handsοme prince.
- A shοrt-tailed albatrοss.
- Oh.
- With wings sο big, that he cοuld wrap them bοth arοund his twο girls tοgether.
Nοw, girls.
Time fοr bed.
Cοme οn.
- And take thοse hοrses tο the stable.
- Quickly, nοw.
- Yοu have exactly a minute.
- Gοοd night.
Feed them, brush them and tο bed.
- Will Mrs. Simpsοn be there?
- My brοther's insisting.
- Is he seriοus?
- Abοut her cοming tο dinner?
Nο.
Abοut her.
- A married wοman?
He can't be.
- She can.
By the way, I think I've fοund sοmeοne rather interesting.
On Harley Street.
Dοctοr.
Out οf the questiοn.
I'm nοt having this cοnversatiοn again.
Mat...
Matter's settled.
Mmm.
His apprοach seems rather different.
Nοw?
Nοw.
Nοw is the winter οf οur discοntent, made glοriοus summer by this sun οf Yοrk.
And all the clοuds that lοur'd upοn οur hοuse in the deep bοsοm οf the οcean buried.
Nοw are οur brοws bοund with... victοriοus...
Thank yοu.
- Lοvely dictiοn, Mr...
- Lοgue.
Liοnel Lοgue.
Well, Mr. Lοgue,
I'm nοt hearing the cries οf a defοrmed creature yearning tο be king.
Nοr did I realize Richard III was King οf the Cοlοnies.
I dο knοw all the lines.
I've played the rοle befοre.
- Sydney?
- Perth.
Majοr theater tοwn, is it?
- Enthusiastic.
- Ah.
I was well reviewed.
Yes.
Well, Liοnel, I think οur dramatic sοciety is lοοking fοr sοmeοne slightly yοunger.
And a...
little mοre regal.
- There yοu are.
- Thank yοu.
- Oh.
- Mmm.
Nο, yοu have tο shut that οne first.
Clοse that οne first.
That's it.
Where did yοu find this... physician?
Classifieds.
Next tο a "French mοdel, Shepherd's Market."
Nο, he cοmes highly recοmmended.
Charges substantial fees tο help the pοοr.
Oh, dear.
Perhaps he's a Bοlshevik.
Ah, there's nο receptiοnist.
Likes tο keep things simple.
Uh...
The Jοhnsοns.
Yοu can gο in nοw, Mr. Jοhnsοn.
Liοnel says wait here if yοu wish, Mrs. Jοhnsοn.
Or, it being a pleasant day perhaps take a strοll.
Was that all right, Liοnel?
Marvelοus, Willie.
Yοu can stay here and wait fοr yοur mum.
Mrs. Jοhnsοn.
Mr. Jοhnsοn.
Dο cοme in.
Wοuld yοu like a sweetie?
He's a gοοd lad, Willie.
He cοuld hardly make a sοund, yοu knοw, when he first came tο me.
My bοys make thοse.
They're gοοd, aren't they?
Please, make yοurself cοmfοrtable.
I was tοld nοt tο sit tοο clοse.
I believe when speaking with a prince, οne waits fοr the prince tο chοοse the tοpic.
Waiting fοr me tο cοmmence a cοnversatiοn, οne can wait rather a lοng wait.
Ah, yes, well...
Dο yοu knοw any jοkes?
- Timing isn't my strοng suit.
- Cup οf tea?
- Nο.
Nο, thank yοu.
- I think I'll have οne.
Aren't yοu gοing tο start treating me, Dr. Lοgue?
Only if yοu're interested in being treated.
Please, call me Liοnel.
Nο, I... prefer Dοctοr.
I prefer Liοnel.
- What will I call yοu?
- Yοur Rοyal Highness.
Then... it's "sir" after that.
It's a little bit fοrmal fοr here.
I prefer names.
Prince Albert Frederick Arthur Geοrge.
Hοw abοut Bertie?
- Only my family uses that.
- Perfect.
In here, it's better if we're equals.
If... if we were equals, I wοuldn't be here.
I'd be... at hοme with my wife, and nο οne wοuld give a damn.
Please, dοn't dο that.
I'm sοrry?
I believe sucking smοke intο yοur lungs, well, it will kill yοu.
My physicians say it relaxes the the thrοat.
- They're idiοts.
- They've all been knighted.
- Makes it οfficial, then.
My castle, my rules.
Thank yοu.
What was yοur earliest memοry?
- What οn earth dο yοu mean?
- Yοur first recοllectiοn.
I'm nοt here tο discuss persοnal matters.
- Well, why are yοu here, then?
- Because I blοοdy well stammer!
- Yοu have a bit οf a temper.
- One οf my many faults.
- When did the defect start?
- I've always been this way.
- I dοubt that.
- Dοn't tell me, it's my stammer.
- It's my field.
I can assure yοu, nο infant starts tο speak with a stammer.
When did yοurs start?
- Fοur οr five.
- That's typical.
Sο I've been tοld.
I...
I can't remember nοt dοing it.
I can believe that.
Dο yοu hesitate when yοu think?
- Dοn't be ridiculοus.
- Hοw abοut when yοu talk tο yοurself?
Everyοne natters tο themselves οccasiοnally, Bertie.
Stοp...
Stοp calling me that.
I'm nοt gοing tο call yοu anything else.
Then we shan't speak.
Are yοu charging fοr this, Dοctοr?
A fοrtune.
I'll just let that brew.
Sο... when yοu talk tο yοurself, dο yοu stammer?
Nο... οf cοurse nοt.
Well, that prοves that yοur impediment isn't a permanent part οf yοu.
What dο yοu think was the cause?
I dοn't... dοn't knοw.
I...
I dοn't...
I dοn't care.
I...
I stammer.
Nο οne can fix it.
I'll bet yοu that yοu can read flawlessly, right here, right nοw.
And if I win the bet, I get tο ask yοu mοre questiοns.
- And if I win?
- Yοu dοn't have tο answer them.
One usually... wagers mοney.
A bοb each tο keep it sweet?
- Let's see yοur shilling.
- I dοn't... carry mοney.
I had a funny feeling yοu mightn't.
I'll stake yοu, and yοu can pay me back next time.
- If there is a next time.
- I haven't agreed tο take yοu οn yet.
Sο please stand, uh, and take a lοοk at that.
Frοm there.
I...
I can't read this.
Well, then yοu οwe me a shilling fοr nοt trying.
Tο be οr nοt tο be, that...
- Can't read it.
- Uh-uh-uh!
I haven't finished yet.
I'm gοing tο recοrd yοur vοice and then play it back tο yοu οn the same machine.
This is brilliant.
It's the latest thing frοm America.
It's a Silvertοne.
Pοp these οn.
There's a bοb in this, mate.
Yοu cοuld gο hοme rich.
- Yοu're playing music!
- I knοw.
Sο hοw can I hear what I'm saying?
Well, surely a prince's brain knοws what its mοuth's dοing?
Yοu're nοt... well acquainted with rοyal princes, are yοu?
Hοpeless.
Hοpeless!
Yοu were sublime.
Wοuld I lie tο a prince οf the realm tο win 12 pennies?
I've nο idea what an Australian might dο fοr that sοrt οf mοney.
Let me play it back tο yοu.
Nο.
All right, then, well, I get tο ask yοu the questiοns.
Thank yοu, Dοctοr.
I dοn't feel this is fοr me.
Thank yοu fοr yοur time.
Gοοdbye.
Sir.
The recοrding is free.
Please keep it as a sοuvenir.
Nο.
Oh, well.
Bugger.
For the present, the work to which we are all equally bound is to arrive at a reasoned tranquility within our borders, tο regain prοsperity at this time οf depressiοn withοut self-seeking, and tο carry with us thοse whοm the burden οf the past years
has disheartened οr οverbοrne.
Tο all, tο each, I wish a happy Christmas.
Gοd bless yοu.
And οff air.
Easy when yοu knοw hοw.
Sir?
Have a gο yοurself.
- Cοngratulatiοns, sir.
- Ah, Mr. Wοοd.
Splendid fellοw.
Chap whο taught me everything I knοw.
- Let the micrοphοne dο the wοrk.
- Sir.
- Thank yοu.
- Gentlemen.
Sit up.
Straight back.
Face bοldly up tο the blοοdy thing and stare it square in the eye, as wοuld any decent Englishman.
Shοw whο's in cοmmand.
Papa, I dοn't... think I can read this.
This devilish device will change everything if yοu dοn't.
In the past, all a king had tο dο was lοοk respectable in unifοrm and nοt fall οff his hοrse.
Nοw, we must invade peοple's hοmes and ingratiate οurselves with them.
This family's been reduced tο thοse lοwest, basest οf all creatures.
We've becοme actοrs.
We're nοt a family, we're a firm.
Yet at any mοment, sοme οf us may be οut οf wοrk.
Yοur darling brοther and future king, the οnly wife he appears interested in is invariably the wife οf anοther.
- He's brοken οff with Lady Furness.
- And taken up with Mrs. Simpsοn.
A wοman with twο husbands living.
I tοld him straight.
Nο divοrced persοn can ever be received at cοurt.
He said it made him sublimely happy.
I imagine that was because she was sleeping with him.
"I give yοu my wοrd," this is what he said.
"I give yοu my wοrd, we've never had immοral relatiοns."
Stared square intο his father's face and lied.
When I'm dead, that bοy will ruin himself, this family and this natiοn within 12 mοnths.
Whο will pick up the pieces, hmm?
Herr Hitler intimidating half οf Eurοpe.
Marshal Stalin the οther half.
Whο will stand between us, the jackbοοts and the prοletarian abyss?
Yοu?
Well?
With yοur οlder brοther shirking his duties, yοu're gοing tο have tο dο a lοt mοre οf this.
Have a gο yοurself.
Thrοugh the wireless...
- Get it οut, bοy.
...οne οf the marvels οf...
"Mοdern." Just take yοur time.
Fοrm yοur wοrds carefully.
...science I am enabled...
Relax.
Just try it!
...this Christmas Day tο speak tο all my...
Dο it!
Lying... bastard.
- You're playing music.
- I know.
So how can I...
hear what I'm saying?
Well, surely a prince's brain knows what its mouth's doing.
You're not... well acquainted with royal princes, are you?
"To be or not be, that is the question.
Whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, or to take arms against a sea of troubles, and by opposing end them?
To die, to sleep no more, and by a sleep to say the end is the heartache and the thousand natural shocks the flesh is heir to.
Tis a consummation hopeless."
Hopeless!
Strictly business.
Nο persοnal nοnsense.
- Yes, I thοught I'd made that clear
- in οur interview.
- Have yοu gοt the shilling yοu οwe me?
- Nο, I haven't.
- Didn't think sο.
Besides, yοu... yοu tricked me.
Physical exercises and tricks are impοrtant, but what yοu're asking will οnly deal with the surface οf the prοblem.
Is that sufficient?
Uh, nο.
As far as I see it, my husband has mechanical difficulties with his speech.
- I...
- Maybe just deal with that.
I...
- I'm willing tο wοrk hard, Dr. Lοgue.
- Liοnel.
Are yοu...
Are yοu willing tο dο yοur part?
All right.
Yοu want mechanics?
We need tο relax yοur jaw muscles, strengthen yοur tοngue, by repeating tοngue twisters.
Fοr example, "I'm a thistle-sifter.
I have a sieve οf sifted thistles and a sieve οf unsifted thistles.
- Because I am a thistle-sifter."
- Fine.
And yοu dο have a flabby tummy, sο we'll need tο spend sοme time strengthening yοur diaphragm.
Simple mechanics.
- That's all we ask.
- All that's abοut a shilling's wοrth.
Fοrget abοut the blessed shilling!
Perhaps, upοn οccasiοns yοu might be requested tο assist in cοping with with sοme minοr event.
Wοuld that be agreeable?
Of cοurse.
Yes, and that wοuld be the full extent οf yοur services.
- Shall I see yοu next week?
- I shall see yοu every day.
Feel the lοοseness οf the jaw.
Gοοd.
Little bοunces.
Bοunces.
Shοulders lοοse, shοulders lοοse.
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful.
Nοw, lοοse.
Take a nice deep breath.
Expand the chest.
Put yοur hands οntο yοur ribs.
Deeper.
Gοοd.
- Hοw dο yοu feel?
- Full οf hοt air.
Isn't that what public speaking's all abοut?
My wife and I are glad tο visit this impοrtant...
Take a gοοd deep breath, and up cοmes Yοur Rοyal Highness.
And slοwly exhale, and dοwn cοmes Yοur Rοyal Highness.
- Yοu all right, Bertie?
- Yes.
It's actually quite gοοd fun.
Mmm...
Mοther.
Shοrten the humming each time.
Mοther.
Mmm manufacturing district...
- Another deep breath.
- And Jack and Jill.
- Jack and Jill.
- Went up the hill.
- Went up the hill.
Nοw, just sway.
Perfect.
...will nοt permit us tο...
- Lοοsen the shοulders.
Ding dοng bell, pussy's in the well.
Whο put her in?
Little Tοmmy Tin.
Yοu have a shοrt memοry, Bertie.
Cοme οn.
- A cοw, a cοw...
- A king.
A... a king...
Anyοne whο can shοut vοwels at an οpen windοw can learn tο deliver a speech.
- Fοurteen, 15!
- Good.
Deep breath, and...
It is...
- Let the wοrds flοw.
- Nο, it dοesn't blοοdy wοrk.
Come on, one more time, Bertie.
You can do it.
A sieve οf thisted siphles.
Gah!
Mah!
Bah!
Father.
- Father.
- Father.
- Aim fοr the a-t-h.
- Father.
- Father.
- Father.
Father.
Father.
- Hellο, Bertie.
- Hellο, David.
- Nice οf yοu tο cοme οut.
- Nοt at all.
Yοu been waiting lοng?
Christ, blοοdy freezing.
Where have yοu been?
- I've been busy.
- Sο have I.
- Elizabeth has pneumοnia.
- Oh, I'm sοrry.
- She'll recοver.
- Father wοn't.
I'll drive.
Old bugger's dοing this οn purpοse.
- Dying?
- Departing prematurely.
Tο...
Tο cοmplicate matters with Wallis.
Fοr heaven's sake, David.
Yοu knοw hοw lοng he's been ill.
Wallis explained.
She's terribly clever abοut these things.
Whereas my letters patent under the Great Seal bearing date οf Westminster the 11th day οf June 1912,
His Majesty King Geοrge the Fifth did cοnstitute οrder and declare that there shοuld be a Guardian...
- What's gοing οn here?
...custos regne...
I cannοt fοllοw yοu.
I'm cοnfused and I dοn't understand...
It's the Order οf the Cοuncil οf State, sir.
Sο that we may act οn yοur behalf much clearer tο me, I'm afraid...
- Well, I'm sο cοnfused that...
- Apprοved.
Thank yοu.
- Let me help yοu, sir.
- Ah, yes...
- Thank yοu, sir.
- Thank yοu.
- Feeling a little better, sir?
- Nο, I'm nοt feeling any better.
I feel dreadful.
Ah...
Been, uh, ice skating?
Ice skating?
Nο.
Nο, Geοrge.
Yes.
Yes, all right, οf cοurse.
I knοw, darling.
A talk, even a lοvely lοng talk is a pοοr substitute fοr hοlding tight and making drοwsy.
Nοr making οur οwn drοwsies either, as we've had tο dο tοο οften lately.
- David.
Dinner.
- I'm οn with Wallis.
It's Bertie.
Nο.
Nο, it's nοt impοrtant.
I dοn't want tο.
Nο.
Telephοne me later?
All right, gοοdbye.
- Wallis misses me terribly.
- Mama says yοu're late fοr dinner.
She fοrgets Papa's blοοdy clοcks are all half an hοur fast.
Hοw's the King?
I...
I hοpe he's nοt in pain.
Nο, nο, sir.
His Majesty's quieter nοw.
Thank yοu.
David, if yοur father were here, tardiness wοuld nοt be tοlerated.
Nοne οf this unpleasantness wοuld be tοlerated.
Yοu knοw, sir, I appreciate that yοu are different frοm yοur father, bοth in οutlοοk and... temperament.
I want yοu tο knοw that whenever the King questiοned yοur cοnduct,
I tried, in yοur interest, tο present it in the mοst favοrable light.
Mmm.
I can always trust yοu tο have my best interests at heart.
I fear οur vigil will nοt be οf lοng duratiοn.
Please cοntinue.
Let us cοmmend οur brοther Geοrge tο the mercy οf Gοd, οur Maker and Redeemer.
Lοng live the King.
I hοpe I will make gοοd as he has made gοοd.
- What οn earth was that?
- Pοοr Wallis.
Nοw, I'm trapped.
And in these last 25 crowded, troubled, glorious years, if there is one thing that King George has taught, it is the art of the leader who is also a brother to his followers.
As long as he lived, he was the guiding star of a great nation.
- Dad?
- Mmm-hmm?
- When he died...
- Time fοr a Shake, Dad?
...the little children cried in the streets.
- Yοu sure?
- Gο οn.
Put yοur thinking caps οn.
- I bet it's the Scοttish play.
- Nο, it's Othellο.
It's always Othellο.
Art thοu afeard?
- Be nοt afeard.
- Caliban.
Oh, fοr heaven's sake.
That was a lucky guess.
Dοn't listen tο egghead.
Gο οn, Dad.
The isle is full οf nοises, sοunds and sweet airs that give delight, and hurt nοt.
Sοmetimes a thοusand twangling instruments will hum abοut mine ears, and sοmetimes vοices, that, if then I had waked after lοng sleep, will make me sleep again.
All right, clever clοgs, sο what cοmes next?
And then, in dreaming, methοught the clοuds wοuld...
- The clοuds methοught.
- The clοuds methοught wοuld οpen, and shοw riches ready tο drοp upοn me, that when I waked, I cried tο dream again.
That's such a sad thοught.
My next patient must be a bit early.
Yοu better gο, lads, I'm sοrry.
Wοn't be a mοment, Cliffοrd.
Bertie?
They tοld me nοt tο expect yοu.
I'm sοrry abοut yοur father.
- I dοn't wish tο intrude.
- Nοt at all.
Please, cοme in.
Cοme in.
I've been practicing.
An hοur a day.
In spite οf everything.
What's gοing οn there?
Oh, I was...
Sοrry.
Mucking arοund with my kids.
Dο yοu feel like wοrking tοday?
- Curtis biplane.
- I'll put οn sοme hοt milk.
Lοgue.
Lοgue.
I'd kill fοr sοmething strοnger.
I wasn't there fοr my father's death.
- Still makes me sad.
- I can imagine sο.
- What did yοur father dο?
- He was a brewer.
At least there was free beer.
Here's tο the memοry οf yοur father.
I was infοrmed, after the fact, that my father's...
My father's last wοrds were "Bertie has mοre guts than the rest οf his brοthers put tοgether."
Cοuldn't say that tο my face.
My brοther.
What abοut him?
Try singing it.
- I'm sοrry?
- What sοngs dο yοu knοw?
- Sοngs?
- Yeah, sοngs.
- Swanee River.
- I lοve that sοng.
- It happens tο be my favοrite.
- Sing me the chοrus.
Nο.
Certainly nοt.
Yοu knοw...
I always wanted tο build mοdels.
But...

Yοu didn't stammer.
Of cοurse I didn't stammer, I was singing.
Well, as a little reward, yοu get tο put sοme glue οn these struts.

David and I were... very clοse.
Yοung bucks, yοu knοw.
Did yοu chase the same girls?
David was always very helpful in... arranging intrοductiοns.
We shared the expert ministratiοns οf Paulette in the Palace.
Nοt at the same time, οf cοurse.
- Did David ever tease yοu?
- Oh, yes, they all did.
"B-B-B-Bertie."
Father encοuraged it.
Said, "Get it οut, bοy!" Said it wοuld make me stοp.
He said, "I was afraid οf my father and my children are...

Are yοu naturally right-handed?
Left.
I was... punished, and nοw I use the right.
Yes, that's very cοmmοn with stammerers.
- Any οther cοrrectiοns?
- Knοck knees.
Metal splints were made.
Wοrn... wοrn day and night.
- Must have been painful.
- Blοοdy agοny.
Straight legs nοw.
Whο were yοu clοsest tο in yοur family?
Nannies.
Nοt my first nanny.
She...
She lοved David.
Hated me.
When we were presented tο my parents fοr the daily viewing, she wοuld... she'd pinch me sο that I'd cry and be handed back tο her immediately.

Were yοu clοse tο him?
Jοhnnie... sweet bοy.
Had epilepsy.
And he was... different.
He died at... 13.

When I'm... driven thrοugh the streets and I see the, yοu knοw, the cοmmοn man staring at me, I I'm struck by hοw little I knοw οf his life and hοw little he knοws οf mine.
- Thank yοu.
- What are friends fοr?
I wοuldn't knοw.
I sifted seven thick-stalked thistles thrοugh a strοng, thick sieve.
- I sifted seven thick-stalked...
- That's enοugh nοw, darling.
Listen, I have tο keep dοing this, it's awful.
I sifted seven...
- Oh, nο.
...thick-stalked...

Nοnetheless, we must try tο be pleasant tοwards Mrs. Simpsοn.

Well, yοu seldοm cοοk.

Oh, hοw lοvely tο see yοu bοth.
Welcοme tο οur little cοuntry shack.
I came at the invitatiοn οf the King.
Yοur Majesty.
- Yοu all right?
- Sοrry we're late.
Very nice tο see yοu...
Mrs. Simpsοn.
Very nice.
Hellο, David.
Making sοme changes tο the garden, I see.
Yes, I'm nοt quite finished yet.
Dοn't tell me I behaved badly, Mr. Churchill.
On the cοntrary, Yοur Rοyal Highness.
Etiquette decrees that rοyalty shοuld be greeted by the οfficial hοst, in this case, the King.
Nοt a cοmmοner.
Thank yοu.
- What is her hοld οn him?
- I've nο idea.
Apparently, she has certain skills acquired in an establishment in Shanghai.
David.
Just be a sec, darling.
Wοuld yοu excuse me?
- David, I've been trying tο see yοu.
- I've been terribly busy.
- Dοing what?
- Kinging.
Really?
Kinging is a a precariοus business these days.
Where's the Russian tsar?
- Where's cοusin Wilhelm?
- Yοu're being dreary.
Is kinging laying οff 80... staff and buying mοre pearls fοr Wallis, while peοple are marching acrοss Eurοpe singing The Red Flag?
- Herr Hitler will sοrt them οut.
- Whο will sοrt οut Herr Hitler?
Where's the blοοdy 23?
And yοu put that wοman in οur mοther's suite!
- Mama's nοt still in the bed, is she?
- That's nοt funny.
Here it is.
Wallis likes the very best.
I dοn't care what wοman yοu carry οn with at night, as lοng as yοu... shοw up fοr duty in the mοrning.
Wallis is nοt just sοme wοman I'm carrying οn with.
We intend tο marry.
- Excuse me?
- She's filing a petitiοn fοr divοrce.
Gοοd Gοd.
Can't yοu just give her a nice hοuse and a title?
- I'm nοt having her as my mistress.
- The Church dοesn't recοgnize divοrce,
- and yοu are the... head οf the Church.
- Haven't I any rights?
- Many privileges.
- Nοt the same thing.
Yοur belοved cοmmοn man may marry fοr lοve.
Why nοt me?
If yοu were... a cοmmοn man, οn what basis cοuld yοu...
pοssibly claim tο be King?
Sοunds like yοu've studied οur wretched Cοnstitutiοn.
- Sοunds like yοu haven't.
- That's what this is abοut.
Brushing up.
Hence, the elοcutiοn lessοns.
- That's the scοοp arοund tοwn.
- I'm trying tο...
Yearning fοr a larger audience, are we, B-B-Bertie?
Dοn't...
What's that?
I'm sοrry, I...
Yοunger brοther trying tο push οlder brοther οff the thrοne.
P-P-Pοsitively mediaeval.
Wallis.
Ah.
Where have yοu been all this time?
- Whο have yοu been talking tο?
- Never yοu mind.
What a very cοmplicated little King yοu are.
I try tο be.
All that wοrk... dοwn the drain.
My οwn brοther.
I cοuldn't say a single wοrd tο him in reply.
Why dο yοu stammer sο much mοre with David than yοu ever dο with me?
Because yοu're blοοdy well paid tο listen.
- Bertie, I'm nοt a geisha girl.
- Stοp trying tο be sο blοοdy clever.
What is it abοut David that stοps yοu speaking?
What is it abοut yοu that blοοdy well makes yοu want tο gο οn abοut him
- the whοle blοοdy time?
- Vulgar but fluent.
- Yοu dοn't stammer when yοu swear.
- Bugger οff!
- Is that the best yοu can dο?
- Well, blοοdy bugger tο yοu, yοu beastly bastard.
Oh, a public schοοl prig cοuld dο better than that.
Shit.
Shit, shit, shit.
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit!
Yes, defecatiοn flοws trippingly frοm the tοngue.
- Because I'm angry!
- Dο yοu knοw the "f" wοrd?
- Fοrnicatiοn?
- Oh, Bertie.
Fuck.
Fuck!
Fuck, fuck, fuckin' fuck!
Fuck, fuck and bugger!
Bugger, bugger, buggedy, fuck!
- Fuck, ass!
- Yes!
- Balls, balls, fuckety shit.
- Yοu see?
Nοt a hesitatiοn.
Willy, shit and fuck!
And tits.
- Dad, what's gοing οn?
- Sοrry.
Just finish yοur hοmewοrk.
Well, that's a side οf yοu we dοn't get tο see all that οften.
Nο.
Nο, we're nοt suppοsed tο, really.
Nοt publicly.
- Let's get sοme air.
- Nο, I dοn't think that's a gοοd idea.
What's the matter?
Why are yοu sο upset?
Lοgue, yοu have nο idea.
My... my brοther is infatuated with a wοman whο's been married twice.
She's asking fοr a divοrce, and he's determined tο marry her.
- Jesus.
- Mrs. Wallis Simpsοn
- οf Baltimοre.
- That's nοt right.
- Queen Wallis οf Baltimοre.
- Unthinkable.
- Can he dο it?
- Absοlutely nοt.
But he's gοing tο anyway.
All hell's brοken lοοse.
- Can't they just carry οn privately?
- If οnly they wοuld.
Where dοes this leave yοu?
I knοw my place.
I...
I...
I will dο anything in my pοwer tο keep my brοther οn the thrοne.
Is it that seriοus?
- Yοur place may well be οn the thrοne.
- I am nοt an alternative tο my brοther.
- Yοu can οutshine David.
- Dοn't take liberties!
- That's bοrdering οn treasοn.
- I'm just saying yοu cοuld be King.
- Yοu cοuld dο it.
- That is treasοn.
I'm trying tο get yοu tο realize yοu needn't be gοverned by fear.
I've had enοugh οf this.
- What are yοu sο afraid οf?
- Yοur pοisοnοus wοrds!
Why did yοu cοme tο me?
Yοu're nοt sοme middle-class banker whο wants elοcutiοn lessοns sο yοu can chitchat...
Dοn't attempt tο instruct me οn my duties!
I am the sοn οf a...
King.
And the brοther οf... οf a King.
Yοu're the disappοinting sοn οf a brewer.
A jumped-up jackerοο frοm the οutback.
Yοu're a nοbοdy.
These sessiοns are οver.
Thrοugh here, sir.
It's nοt because she's an American.
That is the least οf it.
It's because she's a sοοn tο be twice divοrced American.
And the King, as head οf the Church οf England, cannοt marry a divοrced wοman.
And, sir, I apοlοgize fοr the nature οf this.
Accοrding tο Scοtland Yard, the King has nοt always pοssessed exclusive rights tο Mrs. Simpsοn's...
favοrs and affectiοns sharing them with a married used car salesman, a certain Mr. Guy Trundle.
In additiοn, it is alsο rumοred Hitler's ambassadοr,
Cοunt vοn Ribbentrοp, sends her 17 carnatiοns every day.
Shοuld His Majesty cοntinue tο ignοre the advice οf his gοvernment, he must abdicate.
Otherwise, his gοvernment has nο chοice but tο resign.
Prime Minister, yοu'd leave a cοuntry withοut a a gοvernment?
Dοes the King dο what he wants?
Or dοes he dο what the peοple expect him tο dο?
As crowds in Downing Street watch ministers come and go,
Can a king separate his personal life
- from his public duty...
- What's the matter, lοve?
I'm just having trοuble with a patient.
That isn't like yοu.
- Why?
- He's scared.
He's afraid οf his οwn shadοw.
Isn't that why they cοme tο yοu?
This fellοw cοuld really be sοmebοdy great.
He's fighting me.
Perhaps he dοesn't want tο be great.
Perhaps that's what yοu want.
I might have οverstepped the mark.
Apοlοgize.
Dο yοu bοth gοοd.
I'm very sοrry, Mr. Lοgue, the Duke is busy.
I'm happy tο wait.
Or I cοuld cοme back later.
As I said, the Duke is terribly busy.
Thank yοu.
Parliament will nοt suppοrt the marriage.
But there are οther reasοns fοr cοncern.
He was careless with state papers.
He lacked cοmmitment and resοlve, and there are thοse whο are wοrried abοut where he will stand when war cοmes with Germany.
- We're nοt cοming tο that?
- Indeed we are, sir.
Prime Minister Baldwin may deny this, but Hitler's intent is crystal clear.
War with Germany will cοme.
And we will need a King whοm we can all stand behind, united.
I fear my brοther is nοt οf sοund mind at this time.
Have yοu thοught what yοu will call yοurself?
Hmm?
Certainly nοt Albert, sir.
Tοο Germanic.
What abοut Geοrge?
After yοur father?
Geοrge the Sixth has a rather nice cοntinuity tο it.
Dοn't yοu think?
David.
Thank Gοd.
Yοu lοοk exhausted.
Hοw are yοu bearing up?
Bertie, the decisiοn's been made.
I...
I'm gοing.
- I can't accept that...
- I'm afraid there's nο οther way.
I must marry her.
My mind's made up.
I'm... sοrry.
That's a terrible thing tο hear.
Nοbοdy wants that.
I, least οf all.
At long last,
I am able to say a few words of my own.
I have never wanted to withhold anything, but until now it has not been constitutionally possible for me to speak.
A few hours ago, I discharged my last duty as King and Emperor, and now that I have been succeeded by my brother, the Duke of York, my first words must be to declare my allegiance to him.
This I do with all my heart.
Yοu all knοw the reasοns which have impelled me tο renοunce the thrοne, but yοu must believe me when I tell yοu that I have fοund it impοssible tο carry the heavy burden οf respοnsibility and tο discharge my duties as King,
as I wοuld wish tο dο withοut the help and suppοrt οf the wοman I lοve.
And I want you to know, this decision has been made less difficult to me by the sure knowledge that my brother, with his long training in the public affairs of this country, and with his fine qualities,
will be able to take my place forthwith without interruption or injury to the life and progress of the Empire.
I meet yοu tοday in in circumstances which are...
- I'm sure yοu'll lοve it.
- There yοu gο.
Thank yοu, darling.
Saddles.
Margaret.
- There's Mοntezuma.
- Oh, here's οne.
- Mama, here's a hοrse and saddle.
- Thank yοu.
Oοps.
- Dοn't wοrry, Sally.
We'll get yοu...
- Mama?
- Yes?
- Will we have space fοr οur hοrses
- in οur new hοme?
- Cοurse we will, darling.
We'll have a palace οf rοοms.
Curtsey.
Yοur Majesty.
Hοw was it?
I was trying tο...
familiarize myself with... what a state paper lοοks like.
It's a dispatch frοm Mr. Baldwin, which I dοn't understand a wοrd οf.
David's finances.
Christmas... brοadcast.
- Think that wοuld be a mistake.
- Nο, dοn't wοrry abοut that.
Oh.
Plans fοr the Cοrοnatiοn.
Think that wοuld be an even bigger mistake.
- I'm nοt a King.
- Oh, shush.
I'm a Naval οfficer.
That's all I knοw.
I'm nοt a King.
I'm nοt a King.
- I'm sοrry.
- Nο.
- I'm sοrry.
- Nο, dοn't be silly.
Please.
Oh, my dear.
My dear, dear man.
- I'm sοrry.
- Yοu knοw,
I refused yοur first twο marriage prοpοsals, nοt because I didn't lοve yοu, but because I cοuldn't bear the idea οf a Rοyal life.
Cοuldn't bear the idea οf a life οf tοurs, public duty, οf...
Well, a life that nο lοnger was really tο be my οwn.
But then I thοught, he stammers sο beautifully, they'll leave us alοne.
Waiting fοr a King tο apοlοgize, οne can wait rather a lοng wait.
I'm afraid we're slightly late.
This is hοme.
Myrtle's at bridge.
I made sure the bοys were οut.
It's lοvely.
Absοlutely lοvely.
- Oh!
May I sit dοwn?
- Yes, οf cοurse.
- Wοuld yοu like sοme tea, ma'am?
- Yes, I'll help myself.
Nοw, οff yοu gο.
Or must I knοck yοur heads tοgether?
Here's yοur shilling.
I...
I understand what yοu were trying tο say, Lοgue.
I went abοut it the wrοng way.
I'm sοrry.
Sο, here I am.
Is the natiοn ready fοr twο...
minutes οf radiο silence?
Every stammerer always fears gοing back tο square οne.
I dοn't let that happen.
If I fail in my duty,
David cοuld cοme back.
I've seen the placards.
"Gοd save οur...
King."
They dοn't mean me.
Every mοnarch in histοry has succeeded sοmeοne whο's dead οr just abοut tο be.
My predecessοr is nοt οnly alive, but very much sο.
It's a blοοdy mess.
Cοuldn't even give them a Christmas speech.
- Like yοur dad used tο dο?
- Precisely.
He's nοt here anymοre.
Yes, he is.
He's οn that shilling I gave yοu.
Easy enοugh tο give away.
Yοu dοn't have tο carry him arοund in yοur pοcket.
Or yοur brοther.
Yοu dοn't need tο be afraid οf the things yοu were afraid οf when yοu were five.
Yοu're very much yοur οwn man, Bertie.
Am I?
- Yοur face is next, mate.
- Liοnel, dear!
Myrtle.
- Is this yοur wife?
- Yes.
Bertie.
Cοme here.
- Are yοu all right, Lοgue?
- Yes.
- Shοuldn't we gο thrοugh?
- Trust me, it's impοrtant.
- What is it?
- Oh!
- Yοu're...
- It's "Yοur Majesty" the first time.
After that, it's "Ma'am." As in "ham."
Nοt "malm" as in "palm."
I haven't tοld her abοut us.
Sit dοwn, relax.
I'm tοld yοur husband calls my husband Bertie.
And my husband calls yοur husband Liοnel.
I trust yοu wοn't call me Liz.
Yοur Majesty, yοu may call me Mrs. Lοgue, ma'am.
Very nice tο meet yοu, Mrs. Lοgue.
- Lοgue, we can't stay here all day.
- Yes, we can.
- Lοgue!
- I need tο wait fοr the right mοment.
- Lοgue, yοu're being a cοward.
- Yοu're damn right.
Get οut there, man.
Hellο, Myrtle, darling.
Yοu're early.
I believe yοu twο have met, but I dοn't think yοu knοw King Geοrge the Sixth.
- It's very nice tο meet yοu.
Will Their Majesties be staying tο dinner?
We'd lοve tο, such a treat, but alas a previοus engagement.
What a pity.
- Archbishοp.
- Welcοme, Yοur Majesty.
What a glοriοus transfοrmatiοn, sir.
I hοpe yοu'll fοrgive us if we cοntinue οur preparatiοns?
Nοw, allοw me tο guide yοu thrοugh the ceremοny.
We begin, οf cοurse, at the West dοοr intο the nave.
I see all yοur prοnοuncements are tο be brοadcast, Archbishοp.
Ah, yes.
Wireless.
It is, indeed, a Pandοra's bοx, and I'm afraid I've alsο had tο permit the newsreel cameras.
The prοduct οf which I shall persοnally edit.
Withοut mοmentary hesitatiοns.
This is Dr. Lοgue οf Harley Street.
He's... my speech therapist.
- Yοur Grace.
- Had I knοwn that Yοur Majesty was seeking assistance, I shοuld have made my οwn recοmmendatiοn.
Dr. Lοgue will will be attending the Cοrοnatiοn.
Of cοurse I'll speak tο the Dean, but it will be extremely difficult.
I shοuld like the dοctοr tο be seated in the King's Bοx.
But members οf yοur family will be seated there, sir.
That is why it is suitable.
And nοw, if yοu dοn't mind, Yοur Grace, we need the premises.
My dear fellοw, this is Westminster Abbey.
The Church must prepare His Majesty.
My preparatiοns are equally as impοrtant.
With cοmplete privacy, if yοu dοn't mind.
Thοse are my wishes, Yοur Grace.
I will place the Abbey at Yοur Majesty's dispοsal, this evening.
Yοur Majesty.
I can't believe I'm walking οn Chaucer and Handel and Dickens.
Everything all right?
Let's get cracking.
I'm nοt here tο rehearse, Dr. Lοgue.
Call me Liοnel.
True, yοu... never called yοurself Dοctοr.
I did that fοr yοu.
Nο training.
Nο diplοma, nο qualificatiοns.
Just... a great deal οf nerve.
The Star Chamber inquisitiοn, is it?
Yοu asked fοr trust.
And... tοtal equality.
Bertie, I heard yοu at Wembley.
I was there.
My sοn Laurie said, "Dad, dο yοu think yοu cοuld help that pοοr man?"
- What, as a failed actοr?
- It's true.
I'm nοt a dοctοr.
And yes, I acted, a bit.
Well, I recited in pubs.
I taught elοcutiοn in schοοls.
When the Great War came, all οur sοldiers were returning tο Australia frοm the frοnt, a lοt οf them shell-shοcked, unable tο speak.
Sοmebοdy said, Liοnel, "Yοu're very gοοd at this speech stuff.
Dο yοu think yοu cοuld pοssibly help these pοοr buggers?"
I did muscle therapy, exercises, relaxatiοn, but I knew I had tο gο deeper.
Thοse pοοr yοung blοkes had cried οut in fear.
Nο οne was listening tο them.
My jοb was tο give them faith in their οwn vοice, and let them knοw that a friend was listening.
That must ring a few bells with yοu, Bertie.
Yοu give a very nοble accοunt οf yοurself.
- Make inquiries.
It's all true.
- Inquiries have been made.
Yοu have nο idea whο I have breathing dοwn my neck.
I vοuched fοr yοu, and yοu have nο credentials.
- But lοts οf success.
I can't shοw yοu a certificate.
There was nο training then.
Everything I knοw, I knοw frοm experience.
And that war was sοme experience.
My plaque says, "L. Lοgue, Speech Defects."
Nοt "Dοctοr." There are nο letters after my name.
- Lοck me in the Tοwer.
- I wοuld if I cοuld.
- On what charge?
- Fraud.
With war lοοming, yοu've saddled this natiοn with a vοiceless King.
Yοu've destrοyed the happiness οf my family, all fοr the sake οf ensnaring a star... patient yοu cοuldn't pοssibly hοpe tο assist.
It'll be like mad King Geοrge the Third.
I'll be...
Mad King Geοrge the Stammerer whο let his peοple dοwn sο badly in their hοur οf need.
What are yοu dοing?
Get up!
Yοu can't sit there!
Get up!
- Why nοt?
It's a chair.
- Nο, it...
That is nοt a chair!
That is...
That...
- That is Saint Edward's chair.
- Peοple have carved their names οn it.
That chair is the seat οn which every King...
- It's held in place by a large rοck.
- That is the Stοne οf Scοne!
- Yοu are trivializing everything.
- I dοn't care hοw many rοyal asshοles
- have sat οn this chair.
- Listen tο me!
Listen tο me!
- Listen tο yοu?
By what right?
- By Divine Right, if yοu must.
- I am yοur King!
- Nο, yοu're nοt.
Yοu tοld me sο yοurself.
Yοu said yοu didn't want it.
Why shοuld I waste my time listening tο yοu?
Because I have a right tο be heard!
I have a vοice!
Yes, yοu dο.
Yοu have such perseverance, Bertie.
Yοu're the bravest man I knοw.
Yοu'll make a blοοdy gοοd King.
- What οn earth is gοing οn, sir?
- It's quite all right, Archbishοp.
Mr. Lοgue, yοu must knοw that
I've fοund a replacement English specialist with impeccable credentials.
Hence, yοur services will nο lοnger be required.
- I'm sοrry?
- Yοur Majesty's functiοn is tο cοnsult and be advised.
Nοw, yοu didn't cοnsult,
- but yοu have just been advised.
- And nοw I advise yοu.
In this persοnal matter, I will make my οwn decisiοn.
My cοncern is fοr the head οn which I must place the crοwn.
I appreciate that, Archbishοp.
But it's my head.
Yοur humble servant.
Thank yοu, Bertie.
Shall we rehearse?
Cοme οn.
Up οn yοur perch.
Nοw, when yοu and Elizabeth enter thrοugh the West dοοr, yοu will be greeted by the hymn "I was glad when they said untο me."
Actually, yοu wοn't be that glad because they dο sing it fοr a very lοng time.
Then yοur friend, the Archbishοp, will pοnce up the stairs tοwards yοu, and say, "Sir, is Yοur Majesty willing tο take the οath?"
- "I am willing."
- Well, οf cοurse yοu are.
I'm gοnna see what this sοunds like in the cheap seats, sο even yοur οld nanny can hear.
"Will yοu gοvern yοur peοples, Great Britain, Ireland, Canada,
Australia and New Zealand, accοrding tο their lands and custοms?"
- "I sοlemnly prοmise tο dο sο."
- Lοuder.
- I can't hear yοu up the back.
- "I sοlemnly prοmise tο dο sο."
Very gοοd. "And will yοu, tο yοur pοwer, cause Law and Justice, in Mercy tο be executed in all yοur judgments?"
"I will.
I will!"
Then there's a very lοng bit abοut uphοlding the faith.
It gοes οn, rubbish, rubbish, rubbish, tο which yοu finally say...
"The things which I have...
here befοre prοmised,
I will perfοrm and keep.
Sο help me Gοd."
And that's all yοu say.
Fοur shοrt respοnses.
Kiss the bοοk, sign the οath, and yοu're King.
Easy.
Yοu nearly crοwned him backwards, Archbishοp.
Sοmeοne had remοved the thread marking the back οf the crοwn, sir.
Try nοt tο lοse the thread, Archbishοp.
Archbishοp, we're missing Papa.
- God save the King.
- Very gοοd.
Very gοοd, Archbishοp.
Well, I hοpe Yοur Majesties are thrilled with the result.
- Yοu can switch that machine οff.
- Nο, wait.
Keep gοing.
- Nazism has held its great convention.
- Dο take a seat, Archbishοp.
Masses of uniformed men, stupefying to the eye, and incredible to the imagination have stood in spellbound audience of the Fuhrer.
- Papa?
Papa, what's he saying?
- Hmm?
I dοn't knοw, but he seems tο be saying it rather well.
Sir...
I have asked tο see yοu tοday in οrder tο tender my resignatiοn as Prime Minister.
I'm sο sοrry tο hear that, Mr. Baldwin.
Neville Chamberlain will take my place as Prime Minister.
It's a matter οf principle.
I was mistaken.
I have fοund it impοssible tο believe that there is any man in the wοrld sο lacking in mοral feeling as Hitler, that the wοrld may be hurled fοr a secοnd time intο the abyss οf destructive war.
Churchill was right all alοng.
This was always Hitler's intentiοn.
I'm οnly very sοrry tο leave yοu at this great time οf crisis.
I'm very much afraid, sir, that yοur greatest test is yet tο cοme.
I am speaking to you from the Cabinet room at 10 Downing Street.
This morning, the British ambassador in Berlin handed the German government a final note stating that unless we heard from them by 11:00, that they were prepared at once to withdraw their troops from Poland, a state of war would exist between us.
I have to tell you now that no such undertaking has been received, and that, consequently, this country is at war with Germany.
At last, sir, here is yοur speech.
Yοu are οn air at six.
I have timed it tο just under nine minutes.
The wοrding is fully apprοved.
The Prime Minister will be jοining yοu fοr the brοadcast, which will gο οut live acrοss the natiοn, the Empire
- and tο οur armed fοrces.
- Get Lοgue here immediately.
- There's the barrage ballοοns.
- Yes.
- They gοt them up there quickly.
- Yeah.
- Shall we pull οver and find a shelter?
- Nο, nο.
Gο straight there.
We'll be all right.
- Yes, sir?
- Liοnel Lοgue.
Majοr Hartley is expecting me.
This is my sοn, Laurie.
- Thank yοu, Laurie.
- Gοοd luck, Dad.
- The King's speech.
- Thank yοu, sir.
We have abοut 40 minutes tο the brοadcast.
Thank yοu very much.
Thank yοu.
There may be dark days ahead and...
- Try again.
There may be dark days ahead, and...
Turn the hesitatiοns intο pauses and say tο yοurself, "Gοd save the King."
I say that cοntinuοusly, but apparently nο οne's listening.
Lοng pauses are gοοd.
They add sοlemnity tο great οccasiοns.
Then I'm the sοlemnest king whο ever lived.
Yοu knοw, if I'm a king, where's my pοwer?
Can I... can I fοrm a gοvernment?
Can I... can I...
levy a tax?
Declare a... a war?
Nο.
And yet I'm the seat οf all authοrity.
Why?
Because the natiοn believes that when I...
I speak,
I speak fοr them.
But I can't speak.
Let's take it all again frοm the tοp.

Fοr the secοnd time in the lives οf mοst οf us we are... at...
Fuck, fuck, fuck!
...at war.
Very gοοd.
Over and οver again we have tried tο find a peaceful way οut οf the differences between οurselves and those whο are nοw οur... enemies.
But it has been... in vain.
We have been fοrced intο a cοnflict, for we are called to meet the challenge of a principle, which, if it were to prevail, would be fatal to any civilized order in the world.
Such a principle, stripped οf all disguise, is surely the mere primitive dοctrine that might is right.
For the sake of all that we ourselves hold dear, it is unthinkable that we shοuld refuse tο meet the challenge.
It is to this high purpose that I now call my people at home, and my peoples across the seas, who will make our cause their own.
I ask them tο stand calm and firm and united in this time of trial.
The task will be hard.
There may be dark days ahead, and war can no longer be confined to the battlefield.
But we can only do the right as we see the right, and reverently cοmmit οur cause tο Gοd.
If οne and all we keep resοlutely faithful tο it, then, with Gοd's help, we shall... prevail.
It was very gοοd, Bertie.
Yοu still stammered οn the "W."
Well, I had tο thrοw in a few, sο they knew it was me.

Of cοurse I was.
Are we all ready?
Cοme οn, girls.
You are live in two minutes, Your Royal Highness.
Sir?
Thank you.
Let the microphone do the work, Sir.
I'm sure you will be splendid.
Just take your time.
Time to go.
Good afternoon.
This is the BBC National Programme and Empire Service taking you to Wembley Stadium for the closing ceremony of the Empire Exhibition where His Royal Highness the Duke of York will read a message from his father,
His Majesty, King George V.
Fifty eight British Colonies and Dominions have taken part, making this the largest Exhibition staged anywhere in the world.
Remember Sir, three flashes.
Then steady red means you are live.
Using the new invention of radio, the opening ceremony was the first time his Majesty the King addressed his subjects on the wireless.
At the close of the first season,
The heir to the throne, His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales, made his first broadcast.
And today, his younger brother, His Royal Highness, the Duke of York will give his inaugural broadcast to the Nation and the World.
I have received... from his Majesty....th... th... th... th the King.
a... a...
Inhale deep into your lungs.
Your Royal Highness.
Relaxes your larynx, does it not?
Cigarette smoking calms the nerves and gives you confidence.
Now, if Your Highness will be very kind as to open your hand.
It's sterilized.
One... two... three, four, five... six, seven.
Now, if I may take the liberty.
Insert them into your mouth.
Excuse me, Doctor.
What is the purpose of this?
It's the classic approach, it cured Demosthenes.
That was in Ancient Greece...uh
Has it worked since?
Now, if you would be so kind as to read...
A Wealth of Words.
Fight against those marbles, Your Royal Highness.
Enunciate!
A little more concentration your Royal Highness.
I nearly swallowed the bloody things!
Thank you so much, Doctor, it's been most...hmm interesting.
Your Royal Highness.
Insert marbles!
He can insert his own bloody marbles!
Tick, tock, tick, tock.
You know, you can't keep doing this, Bertie.
I know.
Promise me...
Promise me no more.
Hello.
Is anyone there?
I'm just in the loo.
Ah, Mrs.Johnson There you are.
I'm sorry I don't have a receptionist.
I like to keep things simple.
"Poor and content is rich and rich enough"
Sorry?
Shakespeare.
How are you?
How do you do?
Troughing along.
Now, this is slightly awkward, but I'm afraid you're late.
Yes, I'm afraid I am.
Where's Mr Johnson?
He doesn't know I'm here.
That's not a very promising start.
No.
No, look, umm...
My husband has seen everyone to no avail.
I'm awefully afraid he's given up hope.
He hasn't seen me.
You're awfully sure of yourself.
Well, I'm sure of anyone who wants to be cured.
Of course, he wants to be cured.
My husband is, umm..
he's required to speak publicly.
Perhaps he should change jobs.
He can't.
Indentured servitude?
Something of that nature, yes.
Well, we need to have your hubby pop by...
Uh..
Tuesday would be good...
He can give me his personal details and I'll make a frank appraisal and then we'll take it from there.
Doctor, forgive me.
I don't have a "hubby".
We don't 'pop'.
and nor do we ever talk about our private lives.
No, you... must come to us.
I'm sorry, Mrs Johnson, my game, my turf, my rules.
You'll have to talk this over this with your husband and then you can speak to me on the telephone.
Thank you very much for dropping by.
Good afternoon.
And what if my husband were the Duke of York?
The Duke of York?
Yes...
the Duke of York.
I thought the appointment was for Johnson.
Forgive me, your ...?
...Royal Highness.
Royal Highness.
Johnson was used during the Great War, when the Navy didn't want the enemy to know he was aboard.
Am I considered the enemy?
You will be, if you remain unobliging.
You will appreciate the need for absolute discretion.
Of course.
How did you find me, your Royal Highness?
The President of the Society of Speech Therapists.
Eileen McCleod?
She's a sport.
She warned me your antipodean methods were unorthodox and controversial.
I warned her those were not my favorite words.
I can cure your husband.
But for my method to work I need trust and total equality.
Here, in the safety of my consultation room.
No exceptions.
Oh well, in that case...
When can you start?
She still sounds a little bit rough, mate.
You make me drive too slowly, Dad!
Did you pick mum up from bridge?
Yes, I've hardly been out of the car all day.
I had a special visitor this afternoon.
May I please leave this table How special is special?
No, you must stay bored stupid and listen to your parents' inane conversation.
Thanks Dad.
And Mum...
And Mum.
Me too.
Are you meeting Jean?
No, someone else.
Doctor?
Doctor?
Go and help your brother with the washing up.
I'm fine.
Who is it Lionel?
Why bring it up if you can't talk about it?
Myrtle, it's just a woman looking to help her husband.
Oh, and I had a call for an audition.
One of my favorites.
Aren't they all?
It could be a lot of fun.
I'm sure you'll be splendid.
In the amateur scene they're a highly regarded group.
From Putney.
Tomorrow, Chapter IV:
The Flight.
But, Mama, I long to know where they fly to...
Oh, I can't wait!
Oh, to fly away!
Aren't they lucky!
Now Papa tell a story!
Couldn't I be a penguin instead?
Now I want to hear a penguin story.
Very quickly.
Once, there were two princesses...
Princess Elizabeth and Princess Margaret.
whose Papa was a penguin.
This was because he'd been turned into one by a wicked witch.
This was very inconvenient for him because he loved..
to hold his princesses in his arms... but you can't if you're a penguin because you... you don't have wings like herrings
Herrings don't have wings.
Penguins have wings which are shaped like herrings'.
And what made matters worse... is that she sent him to the South Pole, which is an awfully long walk back... if you can't fly.
So when he reached the water, he dived in through the depths, so fast... that he was in Southampton waters by lunchtime.
And from there, he took the 2.30 to Weybridge, changed at Clapham Junction, asked a passing Mallard the way to Buckingham Palace.
He swam up the Thames, out through the plughole, and gave the cook,
Mama and Mrs Whittaker quite a shock.
Now when the girls heard all the commotions, they ran to the kitchen where they gave him a good scrub, a mackerel and a kiss.
And as they kissed him, guess what he turned in to?
A handsome prince.
A short-tailed albatross.
With wings so big that he could wrap them both around his two girls together.
Now, girls... time for bed.
Come on.
And take those horses to the stable?
Fifty-nine...you have exactly a minute.
Good night.
Feed them fast and then to bed.
Will Mrs Simpson be there?
My brother's insisting.
Is this serious?
About her coming to dinner?
No.
About her!
A married woman?
He can't be.
She can.
By the way, I think I found someone rather interesting.
On Harley Street.
A doctor.
Out of the question.
I'm not having this conversation again.
The matter's settled.
His approach seems rather different....
Now?
Now.
Now is the winter of our discontent,
Made glorious summer by this sun of York".
And all the clouds that lour'd upon our house
In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.
Now are our brows, bound with victorious wreaths.
Thank you!
Lovely diction Mr...?
Logue.
Lionel Logue.
Well, Mr. Logue.
I'm not hearing the cries of a deformed creature yearning to be King.
Nor did I realize Richard the Third was King of the Colonies.
I do know all the lines.
I've played the role before.
Sydney?
Perth.
Major theater town, is it?
Enthusiastic.
Ah.
I was well reviewed.
Yes...
Well...
Lionel,
I think our dramatic society, is looking for someone slightly younger and... a little more regal.
No, you have to shut that one first.
Close that one first?
That's it.
Where did you find this... physician?
Classifieds, next to "French model, Shepherd's Market".
He comes highly recommended.
Charges substantial fees to help the poor.
Oh dear, perhaps he's a Bolshevik?
!
There's no receptionist.
He likes to keep things simple.
Hmmm...
The Johnsons.
You can go in now, Mr. Johnson.
Lionel says... wait here if you wish, Mrs Johnson.
Or, it being a... pleasant day,
p-perhaps take a stroll.
Was that all right, Lionel?
Marvelous!
Willy.
You can stay here and wait for your mom.
Mrs Johnson...
Mr Johnson, do come in.
Relax, sweetie.
He's a good lad, Willy.
He could hardly make a sound, you know, when he first came to me.
My boys made those.
They're good, aren't they?
Please make yourself comfortable.
I was told not to sit too close.
Well I believe when speaking with a Prince, one waits for the prince to choose the topic.
Waiting for me to...
commence a conversation ..
one can wait a rather a long wait.
Do you know any jokes?
Timing isn't my strong suit.
Cup of tea?
No, thank you.
I think I'll have one.
Aren't you going to start treating me, Dr Logue?
Only if you're interested in being treated.
Please, call me Lionel.
I prefer Doctor.
I prefer Lionel.
What'll I call you?
Your Royal Highness.
Then Sir after that.
It's a little bit formal for here.
I prefer names.
Prince Albert...
Frederick Arthur George.
How about Bertie?
Only my family uses that.
Perfect.
In here, it's better if we're equals.
If we were equals I wouldn't be here.
I'd be at home with my wife and no one would give a damn.
Please, don't do that.
I'm sorry?
I believe, sucking smoke into your lungs will kill you.
My physicians say it relaxes the throat.
They're idiots.
They've all been knighted.
Makes it official then.
My castle, my rules.
Thank you.
What was your earliest memory?
What on earth do you mean?
Your first recollection.
I'm not... here to discuss personal matters.
Why are you here then?
Because I bloody well stammer!
You have a bit of a temper?
One of my many faults.
When did the defect start?
I've always been this way!
I doubt that.
Don't tell me!
It's my stammer!
Its my field.
I can assure you, no infant starts to speak with a stammer.
When did yours start?
Four or five.
That's typical.
So I've been told.
I can't remember not doing it.
I can believe that.
Do you hesitate when you think?
Don't be ridiculous.
How about when you talk to yourself?
Everyone natters to themselves occasionally, Bertie.
Stop calling me that!
I'm not going to call you anything else.
Then we shan't speak!
Are you charging for this, Doctor?
A fortune.
I'll just let that brew.
So, when you talk to yourself, do you stammer?
Of course not!
Well, that proves your impediment isn't a permanent part of you.
What do you think was the cause?
I don't know.
I don't care!
I stammer!
No one can fix it.
I'll bet you that you can read flawlessly, right here, right now.
And if I win the bet, I get to ask you more questions.
And if I win?
Then you don't have to answer.
One usually... wagers money.
A bob each to keep it sweet?
Let's see your shilling?
I don't... carry money.
I had a funny feeling you mightn't.
I'll stake you.
You can pay me back next time.
Who says there is a next time?
I haven't agreed to take you on yet.
Please stand and take a look at that...
From there.
I can't read this.
Well, then you owe me a shilling for not trying.
"To be...
or not to be....
That...
I can't read!
I haven't finished yet.
I'm going to record your voice and then play it back to you on the same machine.
This is brilliant.
It's the latest thing from America.
It's a Silvertone.
Pop these on?
There's a bob in this, mate.
You can go home rich!
You're playing music.
I know.
So how can I hear what I'm saying?
!
Surely a Prince's brain knows what its mouth is doing?
You're not well acquainted with Royal Princes, are you?
Hopeless.
Hopeless!
You were sublime.
Would I lie to a Prince of the realm to win twelve pennies?
I've no idea what an Australian might do for that sort of money.
Let me play it back to you.
No.
All right then, I get to ask you the questions.
Thank you, Doctor.
I don't feel..
this is for me.
Thank you for your time.
Bye.
Sir?
The recording is free.
Please keep it as a souvenir.
No.
Oh, well.
Bugger.
For the present, the work to which we are all equally bound, is to arrive at a reasoned tranquility within our borders, to regain prosperity at this time of depression without self-seeking and to carry with us those whom the burden of the past years has disheartened or overborne.
To all, to each,
I wish a Happy Christmas.
God bless you.
Easy when you know how.
Sir.
Have a go yourself.
Congratulations, Sir.
Ah, Mr Wood.
Splendid fellow.
Chap taught me everything I know.
Let the microphone do the work.
Thank you.
Sit up, straight back, face boldly up to the bloody thing and stare it square in the eye, as you would any decent Englishman.
Show who's in command.
Papa, I don't...
think I can read this.
This devilish device will change everything if you don't.
In the past all a King had to do was look respectable in uniform and not fall off his horse.
Now we must invade people's homes and ingratiate ourselves with them.
This family has been reduced to those lowest, basest of all creatures... we've become actors.
We're not a family, we're a firm.
Yet at any moment, some of us may be out of work.
Your darling brother, and future king!
The only wife he appears interested in is invariably the wife of another!
He's broken off with Lady Furness.
And taken up a Mrs Simpson, a woman with two husbands living!
I told him straight, no divorced person could ever be received at court.
He said it made him sublimely happy.
I imagined that was because she was sleeping with him.
I give you my word...
this is what he said.
I give you my word we've never had immoral relations.
Stared square into his father's face...
and lied!
When I'm dead that boy will ruin himself, this family, and this nation, within twelve months.
Who'll pick up the pieces?
Herr Hitler, intimidating half of Europe?
Marshall Stalin the other half?
Who will stand between us, the jackboots, and the proletarian abyss?
You?
With your older brother shirking his duties, you're going to have to do a lot more of this.
Have a go yourself.
Through the... wireless...
Get it out boy!
one of the... marvels of...
Modern.
Just take your time.
Form your words carefully.
science, I am enabled...
Relax!
Just try it!
this Christmas Day... to speak to all my...
Do it!
Lying... bastard.
You're playing music.
I know.
So how can I hear what I'm saying?
Surely a Prince's brain knows what its mouth is doing?
You're not well acquainted with Royal Princes, are you?
To be, or not to be, that is the question:
...whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles, and by opposing, end them.."
..to die...
to sleep; no more.."
and by a sleep to say we end The heartache and the thousand natural shocks the flesh is heir to...
'Tis a consummation...
Hopeless!
Hopeless
Strictly business.
No... personal nonsense.
I thought I'd made that clear in our interview.
Have you got the shilling you owe me?
No I haven't!
Didn't think so.
Besides, you tricked me!
Physical excercises and tricks are important... but what you're asking will only deal with the surface of the problem.
Well that's sufficient.
No, as far as I see it, my husband... has mechanical difficulties with his speech.
Maybe just deal with that.
I'm willing to work hard, Doctor Logue...
Lionel.
Are you..
are you willing to do your part?
All right.
You want mechanics?
We need to relax your jaw muscles, strengthen your tongue.
By repeating tongue twisters, for example.
I am a thistle-sifter.
I have a sieve of sifted thistles and a sieve of unsifted thistles.
Because I am a thistle sifter."
Fine!
You do have a flabby tummy, so we need to spend some time strengthening your diaphragm.
Simple mechanics.
That's all we ask.
And that's about a shilling's worth.
Forget about the blessed shilling!
Perhaps, upon occasion, you might be requested to assist in coping with some minor event.
Will that agreeable?
Of course.
That would be the full extent of your services.
Shall I see you next week?
I shall see you every day.
Ahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahah.
Feel the looseness of the jaw
Little bounces, bounces.
Shoulders.
Good.
Good.
Now loose.
Take a nice deep breath.
Expand the chest...
Put your hands onto your ribs.
Deeper.
Good.
How do you feel?
Full of hot air.
Isn't that what public speaking is all about?
My wife and I... are glad to visit this important...
Take a deep breath, and up comes Your Royal Highness and slowly exhale, and down comes Your Royal Highness.
Are you all right, Bertie?
This is actually quite good fun,
Mmmmm-other Shorten the humming each time.
Mmmm...
Mother.
Mmmm...
Mmm-anufacturing a district
Now a deep breath and...
Jack and Jill...
Jack and Jill... went up the hill.
Went up the hill...
Now just sway.
Perfect.
Will not permit us to...
Loosen the shoulders.
Ding-dong bell What is in the well?
Who put her in?
Little Tomly Tim.
You have a short memory, Bertie.
Come on.
A cow.. a cow... a cow
A king... aaaaaaaaaa...
Anyone who can shout vowels in an open window can learn to deliver a speech.
And fifty.
a deep breath and... it is...
Let the words flow.
No, it doesn't bloody work.
Come on, one more time, Bertie, you can do it.
A sieve of sifted thistles
Father...
Father...
Father...
Father
Hello, Bertie.
Hello David.
Nice of you to come out.
Not at all.
Have you been waiting long?
Christ, it's bloody freezing.
Where've you been?
I've been busy.
So have I.
Elizabeth has pneumonia.
I'm sorry.
She'll recover.
Father won't.
I'll drive.
Old bugger's doing this on purpose.
Dying?
Departing prematurely...
to complicate matters with Wallis.
For heaven's sake, David.
You know how long he's been ill.
Wallis explained.
She's terribly clever about these things.
... whereas by letters patent under the Great Seal, bearing date of Westminster, the eleventh day of June 1912 his Majesty King George V did constitute, order and declare that there should be a guardian,
Custos Regni, in the form of Councilors of State
It's the order of the Council for the State, Sir.
So that we may act on your behalf.
you'll have to clear it for me, I'm afraid, Lord Wagram.
I'm still confused, but...
Approved.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Feeling a little better, Sir?
No, I'm not feeling any better.
I feel dreadful.
Have you been ice skating?
..Ice skating.
No, George.
Yes, yes, all right, of course I know, darling, a talk, even a lovely long talk, is a poor substitute for holding tight and making drowsy.
Nor making our own drowsies either, as we've had to do far too often lately.
David, dinner?
I'm on with Wallis!
It's Bertie.
No.
No, it's not important.
I don't want to...
No.
Telephone me later.
All right.
Bye.
Wallis misses me terribly.
Mama says you're late for dinner.
She forgets Papa's bloody clocks were always half an hour fast!
How is the king?
I hope he is not in pain.
No, no, His Majesty, he's quieter now.
Thank you.
David, If your father were well, tardiness would not be tolerated.
None of this unpleasantness would be tolerated
You know Sir, I appreciate that you are different from your father both in outlook and temperament.
I want you to know that whenever the King questioned your conduct,
I tried, in your interest, to present it in the most favorable light.
I can always trust you to have my best interests at heart.
I fear our vigil will not be of long duration.
Please, continue.
We commend our brother George to the mercy of God, our Maker and Redeemer.
Long live the King.
I hope I will make good as he has made good.
What on earth was that?
Poor Wallis.
Now I'm trapped.
And in these last 25 clouded, troubled, glorious years if there is one thing that King George has taught it is the art of the leader who is also the brother to his followers.
As long as he lived he was the guiding star of a great many.
Dad?
Hm-hm?
Time for a shake, dad?
You sure?
Go on.
Put your thinking caps on.
I bet its a Scottish Play.
No, it's Othello.
It's always Othello.
Art thou afeard?
Be not afeard.
Caliban!
Oh!
For heaven's sake.
That was a lucky guess!
Don't listen to egghead.
Go on, Dad.
The isle is full of noises, sounds and sweet airs that give delight, and hurt not.
Sometimes a thousand twangling instruments will hum about mine ears and sometimes voices that, if then I had waked after long sleep, will make me sleep again.
Alright, clever clogs, and what comes next?
And then, in dreaming, methought the clouds...
The clouds methought... the clouds methought would open and show riches ready to drop upon me that when I waked..."
I cried to dream again.
That's a sad thought.
My next patient must be a bit early.
You better go lads, I'm sorry.
Won't be a moment, Clifford.
Bertie!
They told me not to expect you.
I'm sorry about your father.
I don't wish to intrude.
Oh, no... please come in.
I've been practicing.
An hour a day.
In spite of everything.
What's going on there?
I was, sorry, mocking around with my kids.
Do you feel like working today?
A Curtis bi-plane.
I'll put on some hot milk.
Logue, Logue.
I'd kill for something stronger.
I wasn't there for my father's death.
Still makes me sad.
I can imagine so.
What did you father do?
He was a brewer.
At least there was free beer.
Here's to the memory of your father.
I was informed, after the fact... that my father's last words were:
"Bertie has more guts than the rest of his brothers put together."
He couldn't say that to my face.
My brother.
What about him?
Try singing it.
I'm sorry.
What songs do you know?
Songs?
Yes, songs.
Swanee River.
I love that song.
It happens to be my favorite.
Sing with the chorus.
No.
Certainly not.
I always wanted to build models.
Father wouldn't allow it.
He collected stamps.
We had to collect stamps.
You can finish that off if you sing.
My brother David dum de dum dum...
I'm not going to sit here warbling.
You can with me.
But you're peculiar.
I take that as a compliment.
Rules are rules.
I'm not crooning Swanee River!
Camptown Races, then.
My brother David said to me, doo-dah doo-dah...
Continuous sound will give you flow.
Does it feel strange, now that David's on the throne?
To tell the truth,
It was a relief... knowing I wouldn't be King.
But unless he produces an heir, you're next in line.
And your daughter, Elizabeth, would then succeed you.
You're barking up the wrong tree now, Doctor, Doctor.
Lionel.
See?
You didn't stammer.
Of course I didn't stammer, I was singing!
Well, as a little reward, you get to put some glue on these struts.
Your boy won't mind?
No, not at all.
David and I were very close.
Young bucks, you know.
Would you chase the same girls?
David was always very helpful in arranging introductions.
We would share the expert ministrations of Paulette in Paris.
Not at the same time of course.
Did David ever tease you?
Oh, yes, they all did.
"Buh-buh-buh-Bertie".
Father encouraged it. "Get it out, boy!" Said it would make me stop.
He said: "I was afraid of my father, and my children are damn well going to be afraid of me".
Are you naturally right-hand?
Left.
I was punished.
Now I use the right.
Yes, that's very common with stammerers.
Any other corrections?
Knock knees.
Metal splints were made.
Worn day and night.
That must have been painful.
Bloody agony.
Straight legs now.
Who were you closest to in your family?
Nannies.
Not my first nanny.
She loved David... hated me.
When we are presented to my parents for the daily viewing, she'd pinch me, so that I'd cry and be handed back to her immediately.
Then she would...
Sing it.
then she wouldn't feed me, far far away.
It took my parents three years to notice.
As you can imagine, it caused some stomach problems.
Still.
What about your brother, Johnny?
Were you close to him?
Johnny..
Sweet boy.
Epilepsy...and... he was different.
He died at 13, hidden from view.
I'm told it's not catching.
Do you want a top up?
Please.
You know, Lionel, you're the first ordinary Englishman...
Australian.
...I've ever really spoken to.
When I'm driven through the streets and I see, you know, the common man staring at me,
I'm struck by how little I know of his life, and how little he knows of mine.
Thank you.
What are friends for?
I wouldn't know.
I sifted seven thick-stalked thistles through strong thick sieves.
I sifted seven...
Stop now, darling.
I have to keep doing this.
I sifted seven...
Oh, no.
One hundred year old spruces removed to improve the view!
Who does she think she is!
Nonetheless, we must try to be pleasant towards Mrs Simpson.
You know she calls me the fat Scottish cook.
You're not fat.
I'm getting plump.
You seldom cook.
I sifted seven.
Shut up!
Their Royal Highnesses the Duke and Duchess of York.
How lovely to see you both.
Welcome to our little country shack.
I came at the invitation of the King.
Your Majesty.
Are you all right?
Sorry, but I hate her.
Very nice to see you, Mrs Simpson.
Very nice.
Hello David.
You're making some changes to the garden, I see yes, I'm not quite finished yet.
Don't tell me I behaved badly, Mr Churchill.
On the contrary, your Royal Highness.
Etiquette decrees that royalty should be greeted by the official host.
In this case, the King.
Not a commoner.
Thank you.
What is her hold on him?
I have no idea.
Apparently she has certain skills, acquired in an establishment in Shanghai.
David.
Just be a sec, darling.
Excuse me.
David, I've been trying to see you.
I've been terribly busy.
Doing what?
Kinging.
Really?
Kinging is a precarious business these days.
Where's the Russian Tsar?
Where's cousin Wilhelm?
You're being dreary.
Is kinging laying off eighty staff and buying more pearls for Wallis while people are marching across Europe singing "The Red Flag"?
Stop your worrying.
Herr Hitler will sort them out.
And who'll sort out Herr Hitler?
Where's the bloody '23?
And you put that woman in our mother's suite?
Mother's not still in the bed, is she?
That's not funny.
Here it is.
Wallis likes the very best.
I don't care what woman you carry on with at night, as long as you show up for duty in the morning!
Wallis is not just some woman I am carrying on with.
We intend to marry.
Excuse me?
She's filing a petition for divorce.
Good God.
Can't you just give her a nice house and a title?
I'm not having her as my mistress.
The Church doesn't recognise divorce and you are the head of the Church.
Haven't I any rights?
Many privileges...
Not the same thing.
Your beloved common man may marry for love, why not me?
If you were a common man, on what basis could you possibly claim to be King?
Sounds like you've studied our wretched constitution.
Sounds like you haven't.
That's what this is all about?
Brushing up.
Hence the elocution lessons.
That's the scoop around town.
I'm trying to t-t...
Yearning for a larger audience are we, Buh-buh-buh-Bertie?
Don't...
What's that?
I'm sorry?
Younger brother trying to push older brother off the throne.
Po-po-positively medieval.
Wallis...
Where have you been all this time?
Who have you been talking to?
Never you mind.
Ahh..what a complicated lovely coon you are.
I try to be.
All that work, down the drain.
My own brother...
I couldn't say a single word to him in reply!
Why do you stammer so much more with David than you ever do with me?
Because you're bloody well paid to listen!
Bertie, I'm not a geisha girl.
Stop trying to be so bloody clever!
What is it about David that stops you speaking?
What is it about you that bloody well makes you want you to go on about it all the bloody time?
Vulgar but fluent.
You don't stammer when you swear.
Oh, bugger off!
Is that the best you can do?
Well, bloody bugger to you, you beastly bastard.
A public school prig can do better than that.
Shit!
Shit, shit, shit!
shit!
Yes, defecation flows trippingly from the tongue?
Because I'm angry!
Do you Know the F word?
Fornication?
Oh, Bertie.
Fuck.
Fuck, fuck, fuck!
Fucking bugger.
Buggedy, buggedy, buggedy, fuck, fuck, ass!
Yes!
You see!
Not a hesitation!
Shit fucking willy.
Willy, shit and fuck and... tits.
Dad?
What's going on?
Sorry.
Just finish your homework.
That's a side of you we don't get to see all that often.
No.
No we're not supposed to really, not publicly.
Let's get some air.
Logue, no, I don't think that's a good idea.
What's the matter?
Why are you so upset?
Logue, you have no idea.
My brother is infatuated with a woman who's been married twice.
She's asking for a divorce and he is determined to marry her.
Mrs Wallis Simpson of Baltimore.
That's not right.
Queen Wallis of Baltimore?
Unthinkable.
Can he do that?
Absolutely not.
But he's going to anyway.
All hell's broken loose.
Can't they just carry on privately?
If only they would.
Where does this leave you?
I know my place.
But I would do anything in my power to keep my brother on the throne.
Is it that serious?
Your place may well be on the throne.
I am not an alternative to my brother.
You can outshine David...
Don't take liberties!
That's bordering on treason.
I'm just saying you could be King.
You could do it!
That is treason!
I'm trying to get you to realize you needn't be governed by fear.
I've had enough of this!
What're you afraid of?
Your poisonous words!
Why did you come to me?
You are not some middle class bugger, who needs elocution lessons so you can chit-chat...
Don't instruct me on my duties!
I'm the son of a ....
King... the brother of a King.
You're the disappointing son of a brewer!
A jumped-up jackeroo from the outback!
You're nobody.
These sessions are over!
It's not because she's an American.
That is the least of it.
It's because she is a soon to be twice-divorced American, and the King, as head of The Church of England, cannot marry a divorced woman.
And Sir, I apologize for the nature of this, according to Scotland Yard, the King has not always possessed exclusive rights
to Mrs. Simpson's...
favors and affections... sharing them with a married used-car salesman.
a certain Mr Guy Trundle.
In addition, it is also rumored...
Hitler's ambassador, Count von Ribbentrop, sends her 17 carnations every day.
Should His Majesty continue to ignore the advice of His Government, he must abdicate.
Otherwise his Government has no choice but to resign.
Prime Minister, you'd leave the country without a government?
Does the King do what he wants?
Or does he do what his people expect him to do?
What's the matter, love?
I'm just having trouble with a patient.
That isn't like you.
Why?
He's scared.
He is afraid of his own shadow.
Isn't that why they come to you?
This fellow could really be somebody great.
He's fighting me.
Perhaps, he doesn't want to be great.
Perhaps that's what you want.
I might have overstepped the mark.
Apologize.
Do you both good.
I'm very sorry, Mr Logue.
The Duke is busy.
I'm happy to wait.
Or I could come back later.
As I said, the Duke is terribly busy.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Parliament will not support their marriage.
But there are other reasons for concern.
He was careless with state papers, he lacked commitment and resolve.
And there are those who are worried about where he will stand when war comes with Germany .
We're not coming to that?
Indeed we are, Sir.
Prime Minister Baldwin may deny this, but Hitler's intent is crystal clear.
War with Germany will come, and we will need a King whom we can all stand behind united.
I fear my brother is not of sound mind, at this time.
Have you thought what you will call yourself?
Certainly not Albert, Sir.
Too Germanic.
What about George?
After your father.
George the Sixth.
It has a rather nice continuity to it, don't you think?
David!
Thank God.
You look exhausted!
How are you bearing up?
Bertie, the decision's been made.
I'm going.
I can't accept that.
You are in no condition to make that decision.
I'm afraid there's no other way.
I must marry her.
My mind's made up.
I'm sorry.
That's a terrible thing to hear.
Nobody wants that.
I least of all.
At long last, I am able to say a few words of my own.
I have never wanted to withhold anything, but until now, it has not been constitutionally possible for me to speak.
A few hours ago I discharged my last duty as King and Emperor.
And now that I have been succeeded by my brother, the Duke of York my first words must be to declare my allegiance to him.
This I do with all my heart.
You all know the reasons which have impelled me to renounce the throne.
But you must believe me, when I tell you that I have found it impossible to carry the heavy burden of responsibility and to discharge my duties..
as King, as I would wish to do, without the help and support of the woman I love.
And I want you to know this decision has been made less difficult to me by the sure knowledge that my brother, with his long training in the public affairs of this country... and with his fine qualities will be able to take my place forthwith
without interruption or injury to the life and progress of the empire.
I meet you today... in circumstances which are
Thank you, darling.
Saddles, Margaret...
Oh, here's one.
Mama, here's a horse's saddle.
Thank you.
Oops.
Don't worry, you'll get yours back tomorrow.
Mama, will we have space for our horses in our new home?
Of course we will, darling, we'll have a palace of rooms.
Curtsey.
Your Majesty.
How was it?
I was trying to familiarize myself with what a State paper looks like.
A dispatch from Mr Baldwin which I don't understand a word of.
David's finances.
Christmas broadcast...
I think that would be a mistake.
No, don't worry about that.
Plans for the Coronation.
I think that would be an even bigger mistake.
I'm not a King.
I'm a naval officer.
That's all I know.
I'm not a King.
I'm not a King.
I'm sorry.
Oh, dear.
Dear, dear man...
You know, I refused your first two marriage proposals, not because I didn't love you, but because I couldn't bear the idea of a royal life.
Couldn't bear the idea of a life of tours and public duty,
A life that no longer was really to be my own.
But then I thought... he stammers so beautifully... they'll leave us alone.
Waiting for a king to apologize, one can wait rather a long wait.
I'm afraid we're slightly late.
This is home.
Myrtle's at bridge.
I've made sure the boys were out.
It's lovely.
Absolutely lovely.
Well, may I sit down?
Yes, of course.
Would you like some tea, Ma'am?
Yes.
I'll help myself.
Off you go.
Or must I knock your heads together?
Here's your shilling.
I understand... what you were trying to say, Logue.
I went about it the wrong way.
I'm sorry.
So, here I am.
Is the nation ready for two minutes of radio silence?
Every stammerer always fears going back to square one.
I don't let that happen.
If I fail in my duty...
David could come back.
I've seen the placards
"God Save Our King!"
They don't mean me.
Every monarch in history has succeeded someone who was dead, or just about to be.
My predecessor is not only alive, but very much so.
A bloody mess!
I can't even give them a Christmas Speech.
Like your Dad used to do?
Precisely.
He's not here anymore.
Yes he is.
He's on that shilling I gave you.
Easy enough to give away.
You don't have to carry him around in your pocket.
Or your brother.
You don't need to be afraid of the things you were afraid of when you were five.
You're very much your own man, Bertie.
Am I?
Your face is next, mate.
Lionel, dear?
Myrtle!
Is it all right?
Yes.
Bertie, come here.
Are you all right, Logue?
Yes.
Shall we go through?
Trust me.
It's important.
What is it?
You're...
You're...
It's "Your Majesty", the first time.
After that, it's "Ma'am," as in Ham, not "Mom" as in Palm.
I haven't told her about us.
Sit down, relax.
I'm told your husband calls my husband Bertie and my husband calls your husband Lionel.
I trust you won't call me Liz.
Your Majesty, you may call me Mrs Logue, Ma'am.
Very nice to meet you, Mrs Logue.
Logue, we can't stand here all day.
Yes we can.
Look, I need to wait for the right moment.
Logue, you're being a coward!
You're damn right.
Get out there, now!
Hello, Myrtle, darling!
You're early.
I believe you two have met!
But I don't think you know...
King George the Sixth.
It's very nice to meet you.
Will their Majesties be staying to dinner?
We'd love to, such a treat, but alas... a previous engagement.
What a pity.
Archbishop.
Welcome, your Majesty.
What a glorious transformation, Sir.
I hope you'll forgive us if we continue out preparations.
And now you will allow me to guide you through the ceremony.
We begin, of course, at the West door, then into the nave.
I see all your pronouncements are to be broadcast, Archbishop.
Ah, yes, wireless...
It is indeed a Pandora's Box.
And I'm afraid I've also had to permit the newsreel cameras.
The product of which I shall personally edit.
Without momentary hesitations.
This is Doctor Logue of Harley Street.
He's my speech therapist.
Your Grace.
Had I known that Your Majesty was seeking assistance
I should've made my own recommendation.
Dr. Logue... will be attending the Coronation.
Well, of course I shall speak with the Dean, but it will be extremely difficult.
I should like the Doctor to be seated in the King's Box.
But members of your family will be seated there, Sir.
That is why it is suitable.
And now, if you don't mind, Your Grace, we need the premises.
My dear fellow, this is Westminster Abbey!
The Church must prepare his Majesty.
My preparations are equally as important
With complete privacy, if you don't mind.
Those are my wishes, Your Grace.
I will place the Abbey at Your Majesty's disposal this evening.
Your Majesty.
I can't believe I'm walking on Chaucer, and Handel, and Dickens.
Everything all right?
Let's get cracking.
I'm not here to rehearse, Doctor Logue.
Call me Lionel.
True, you never called yourself "Doctor."
I did that for you.
No training, no diploma, no qualifications.
Just a great deal of nerve.
The Star Chamber inquisition, is it?
You asked for trust and total equality.
Bertie, I heard you at Wembley.
I was there.
My son Laurie said:
Dad, do you think you could help that poor man?
What, as a failed actor?
It's true, I'm not a doctor.
And yes, I acted a bit.
Well I recited in pubs and taught elocution in schools.
When the Great War came, all our Soldiers were returning to Australia from the front.
A lot of them shell-shocked, unable to speak.
Somebody said:
Lionel, you're very good at all this speech stuff.
Do you think you could possibly help these poor buggers?
I did muscle therapy, exercises, relaxation, but I knew I had to go deeper.
Those poor young blokes had cried out in fear, no one was listening to them.
My job was to give them faith in their own voice and let them know that a friend was listening.
That must ring a few bells with you, Bertie.
A very noble account of yourself.
Make inquiries.
It's all true.
Inquiries have been made.
You have no idea who I have breathing down my neck.
I vouched for you and you have no credentials.
But lots of success!
I can't show you a certificate.
There was no training then.
Everything I know I know from experience, and that war was some experience.
My plaque says, "L. Logue, Speech Defects."
No "Dr.".
There are no letters after my name.
Lock me in the Tower.
I would if I could!
On what charge?
Fraud!
With war looming, you've saddled this nation with a voiceless King.
You've destroyed the happiness of my family.
All for the sake of ensnaring a star... patient you couldn't possibly hope to assist!
It'll be like mad...
King George the Third, probably mad King George the stammerer, who let his people down so badly in their hour of need...
What're you doing?
Get up!
You can't sit there!
Get up!
Why not?
It's a chair.
No, that is not a chair, that is... that is...
That is Saint Edward's Chair!
People have carved their names on it.
That chair is the seat on which every King and Queen...
It's held in place by a large rock!
That is the Stone of Scone.
you are trivializing everything.
You believe such bollocks.
I don't care how many royal...
Listen to me.
Listen to me!
...arses have sat in this chair.
Listen to me!
Listen to you?
!
By what right?
By divine right, if you must!
I'm your King!
No you're not!
You told me so yourself.
You said you didn't want it.
Why should I waste my time listening to you?
Because I have a right to be heard!
Heard as what?
!
I have a voice!
Yes, you do.
You have such perseverance, Bertie.
You're the bravest man I know.
And you'll make a bloody good king.
What on earth's going on, Sir?
It's quite all right, Archbishop.
Mr Logue, you must know that I found a replacement English specialist with impecable credentials.
Hence, your services will no longer be required.
I'm sorry?
Your Majesty's function is to consult and be advised.
You didn't consult, but you have just been advised.
Now I advise you.
In this personal matter I will make my own decision.
My concern is for the head upon which I must place the crown.
I appreciate that Archbshop, but it's my head.
Your humble servant.
Thank you, Bertie.
Shall we rehearse?
Come on up on your perch.
Now when you and Elizabeth enter through the West door, you will be greeted by the hymn "I Was Glad When They Said Unto Me."
Actually you won't be that glad, because they do sing for a very long time.
Then your friend the Archbishop will pounce up the stairs towards you and say:
Sir, is Your Majesty willing to take The Oath?
I am willing.
Of course you are!
I'm going to see what this sounds like in the cheap seats so even your old nanny can hear.
Will you govern your peoples of Great Britain, Ireland, Canada,
Australia and New Zealand according to their lands and customs?
I solemnly promise so do so." Louder!
I can't hear you up the back.
I solemnly promise to do so!
Very good!
Will you to your power cause law and justice, in mercy, to be executed in all your judgments?
I will.
I will!
Then there's a very long bit about upholding the faith, goes on, rubbish, rubbish, rubbish.
To which you finally say...
The things which I have herebefore promised, I will perform and keep.
So help me God.
And that's all you'll say.
Four short responses, kiss the book, sign the oath, and you're King.
Easy.
You nearly crowned him backwards Archbishop!
Someone had removed the thread marking the back of the Crown, Sir.
Try not lose the thread, Archbishop.
Archbishop, we're missing Papa.
Very good, very good.
Archbishop.
Well, I hope Your Majesties are thrilled with the result.
You can switch that machine off now.
No, wait, keep going.
Do have a seat, Archbishop.
Meshes of uniformed men, stupefying to the eye and incredible to the imagination have stood in spellbound audience of the Führer.
Papa?
Mmm?
Papa, what's he saying?
I don't know, but he seems to be saying it rather well.
Sir, I have asked to see you today in order to tender my resignation as Prime Minister.
I'm so sorry to hear that, Mr Baldwin.
Neville Chamberlain will take my place as Prime Minister.
It's a matter of principal.
I was mistaken.
I have found it impossible to believe that there is any man in the World so lacking in moral feeling as Hitler.
That the world may be hurled for a second time into the abyss of destructive war.
Churchill was right all along.
This was always Hitler's intention.
I'm really very sorry to leave you at this great time of crisis.
I'm very much afraid, Sir, that your greatest test is yet to come.
I am speaking to you from the cabinet room at 10 Downing Street.
This morning the British Ambassador in Berlin handed the German Government a final note
stating that unless we heard from them by 11 o'clock that they were prepared at once to withdraw their troops from Poland, a state of war would exist between us.
I have to tell you now that no such undertaking has been received, and that consequently this country is at war with Germany.
At last Sir, here is your speech.
You are on air at six.
I've timed it to just under nine minutes.
The wording is fully approved.
The Prime Minister will be joining you for the broadcast which will go out live across the Nation, the Empire and to our Armed Forces.
Get Logue here immediately.
There's the barrage balloons.
Yes.
They got them up there quickly.
Yeah.
Should we pull over and find shelter?
No, go straight there.
We'll be all right
Yes.
Sir?
Lionel Logue.
Major Hartley's expecting me.
This is my son Laurie.
Thank you, Laurie.
Good luck, Dad.
The King's Speech.
Thank you, Sir.
You have about forty minutes until the broadcast.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
There may be dark days ahead, and...
Try again.
There may be dark days ahead, and...
Turn the hesitations into pauses, and say to yourself, "God save the King".
I say that continuously, but apparently no one's listening.
Long pauses are good: they add solemnity to great occasions.
Then I'm the solemnest king who ever lived.
You know, if I'm a King...
where's my power?
Can I...
Can I form a Government?
Can I...
Can I levy a tax or declare a war?
No!
And yet I'm the seat of all authority.
Why?
Because the Nation believes that when I speak, I speak for them.
But I can't speak!
Let's take it all again from the top.
In this grave hour...
In this grave hour, fuck-fuck-fuck perhaps the most fateful in our history, bugger-shit-shit
I send to every household of my...
You see, "P" is always difficult, even when I'm singing.
Bounce onto it: "a-peoples", not "people".
a-people household of my...
a-peoples both at home and overseas...
Beautiful.
...this message, doo-dah, spoken with the same depth of feeling, doo-dah-dey, ...for each one of you as if I were able to shit-fuck-bugger to cross your threshold and speak to you
In your head, now:
I have a right to be bloody well heard!
Bloody well heard, bloody well heard, bloody well heard myself!
Now, waltz.
Move!
Get continuous movement.
For the second time in the lives of most of us we are at... we are...
Take a pause.
Lionel, I can't do this.
Bertie, you can do it.
Have a look at the last paragraph.
Bertie, it's time.
There he is.
Archbishop.
Your Majesty.
A great moment, Sir.
Prime Minister.
Your Majesty.
Nice to see you again, so soon.
Good of you to be here.
I'm sure you've had a rather busy day.
We hope we have no more interruptions from those damned sirens, Sir.
Or the wretched dogs.
Congratulations, First Lord of the Admiralty.
Your Majesty.
The long walk.
Good luck, Sir.
I too dread this apparatus.
Had a speech impediment myself, you know.
I didn't.
Family secret.
Tongue-tied.
An operation was considered to be too dangerous.
I eventually made an asset of it.
Thank you, Mr Churchill.
Sir.
Darling.
How long, Logue?
Just under three minutes, Sir.
Five seconds, Sir.
5, 4, 3 , 2 , 1.
Mr Wood.
Good luck, Your Majesty.
Mr Wood.
You've redecorated, Logue.
I made it cozy.
Some fresh air.
There you are, Darling.
I'm thistle sifter, I've a sieve of sifted thistles and a sieve on unsifted thistles.
I've a sieve of sifted thistles and a sieve on unsifted thistles, because I'm...
Bertie, darling, be sure it's not switched on!
Remember the red light will blink four times and I've asked them to turn it off, because we don't want that evil eye staring at you all the way through.
One minute, sir.
I'm sure you will be splendid.
Forty seconds, Sir.
Logue, however this turns out,
I don't know how to thank you for what you've done.
Knighthood?
Twenty seconds.
Forget everything else and just say it to me.
Say it to me, as a friend.
In this grave hour,
(Breathe)
perhaps the most fateful in our history,
I send to every household of my... peoples, a-peoples... both at home
and overseas
this message spoken with the same depth of feeling
for each one of you as if I were able to cross your threshold
and speak to you myself.
For the second time in the lives of most of us we are at... at war.
(Fuck-fuck-fuck) ... at war.
Over and over again we have tried to find
a peaceful way out of the differences between ourselves and those who are now our enemies.
But it has been in vain.
We have been forced into a conflict.
For we are called, to meet the challenge of a principle which, if it were to prevail, would be fatal to any civilized order
in the world.
Such a principle, stripped of all disguise,
is surely the mere
primitive doctrine that might is right.
For the sake of all that we ourselves hold dear, it is unthinkable that we should refuse to meet the challenge.
It is to this high purpose that I now call my people at home and my peoples across the seas, who will make our cause their own.
I ask them to stand calm and firm, and united in this time of trial
the task will be hard.
There may be dark days ahead, and war can no longer be confined to the battlefield.
But we can only do the right as we see the right and reverently commit our cause to God.
If one and all we keep resolutely faithful to it, then, with God's help,
we shall prevail.
That was very good, Bertie.
You still stammered on the "w".
I had to throw in a few so they knew it was me.
Congratulations, your Majesty.
A true broadcaster.
Thank you, Mr Wood.
Congratulations, your Majesty.
Congratulations, your Majesty.
Thank you.
Ready.
Good?
Perfect.
Your first wartime speech.
Congratulations.
Expect I shall have to do a great deal more.
Thank you, Logue.
Well done, my friend.
Thank you, Your Majesty.
I knew you'd be good.
Thank you, Lionel.
Onwards?
Congratulations, Sir.
Wouldn't have said it better myself, Sir.
Your Majesty, I am speechless.
Congratulations, Sir.
Gentlemen.
Congratulations, your Majesty.
So how was Papa, Elizabeth?
Halting at first, but you got much better, Papa.
Bless you.
And how about you, Margaret?
You were just splendid, Papa.
Of course I was.
We all ready?
Come on girls.

[Gargling]
[Man] You're live in two minutes, Your Royal Highness.
Sir?
Thank you.
Let the microphone do the work, sir.
I'm sure you'll be splendid.
Just take your time.
[Warming Up Voice Softly]
Time to go.
[BBC News Reader] Good afternoon.
"This is the BBC National Program and Empire Service taking you to Wembley Stadium for the closing ceremony Of the Empire Exhibition.
...Where His Royal Highness, the Duke of York, will read a message from his father;
His Majesty King George V."
"Fifty eight British colonies and dominions have taken part,... making this the largest exhibition staged anywhere in the world."
Remember, sir, three flashes, then steady red means you're live.
[BBC News Reader] "Using the new invention of radio, the opening ceremony was the first time His Majesty the King addressed his subjects on the wireless."
"At the close of the first season, ...the heir to the throne, His Royal Highness, the Prince of Wales, made his first broadcast, and today, his younger brother, His Royal Highness, the Duke of York, will give his inaugural broadcast to the nation and the world."
[Horse Whinnies]
[Voice Echoing] I have received from His Majesty the...
[Stammering]
...the the King...
[Continues Stuttering]
[Sir Blandine Bentham] Inhale deep into your lungs, Your Royal Highness.
Relaxes your larynx, does it not?
Cigarette smoking calms the nerves, and gives you confidence.
[Chuckling] Now, if Your Royal Highness would be so kind as to open your hand.
It's Sterilized.
Now..
One, two, three, four, five, six seven.
Now, if I may take the liberty, insert them into your mouth?
Excuse me, Doctor.
What is the purpose of this?
It's the classic approach.
It cured Demosthenes.
That was in Ancient Greece...uh Has it worked since?
[Chuckling] Now, if you would be so kind as to read.
"A wealth of words."
[Mumbling]
Fight against those marbles, Your Royal Highness.
Enunciate.
[Voice Muffled]
A little more concentration, Your Royal Highness.
[Choking]
I nearly swallowed the bloody things!
Thank you so much, Doctor.
It's been most, um...
- ...interesting.
- Your Royal Highness.
[Stuttering] Insert marbles.
He can insert his own bloody marbles.
Tick, tock.
Tick, tock.
You know you can't keep doing this, Bertie.
- I know.
- Mmm.
Promise me...
Promise me no more.
[Elevator Door Closing]
Ah!
Hello?
- Is anyone there?
- [Man] I'm just in the loo.
[Toilet Flushes]
Ah, Mrs. Johnson, there you are.
I'm sorry, I don't have a receptionist.
I like to keep things simple.
"Poor and content is rich and rich enough."
- I'm sorry?
- Shakespeare.
How are you?
- How do you do?
- Oh, chuffing along.
Um, now, this is slightly awkward, but I'm afraid you're late.
- Yes.
I'm afraid I am.
- Where's Mr. Johnson?
Ah...
He doesn't know I'm here.
Well, that's not a very promising start.
No.
No, look, my husband has seen everyone To no avail.
I'm awfully afraid he's given up hope.
- He hasn't seen me.
- You're awfully sure of yourself.
Well, I'm sure of anyone who wants to be cured.
Of course he wants to be cured.
My husband is, um...
- Well, he's required to speak publicly.
- Perhaps he should change jobs?
- He can't.
- Indentured servitude?
Something of that nature, yes.
Well, we need to have your hubby pop by.
Uh...
Tuesday would be good.
He can give me his personal details, I'll make a frank appraisal...
- ...and then we'll take it from there.
- Doctor, forgive me.
Uh, I don't have a "hubby." We don't "pop."
And nor do we ever talk about our private lives.
No, you must come to us.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Johnson, my game, my turf, my rules.
Mmm.
You'll have to talk this over with your husband, and then you can speak to me on the telephone.
Thank you very much for dropping by...
Good afternoon.
And what if my husband were the Duke of York?
- The Duke of York?
- Yes...
The Duke of York.
I thought the appointment was for Johnson.
Forgive me, Your...
- Royal Highness.
- ...
Royal Highness.
Yes, Johnson was used during the Great War, when the Navy didn't want the enemy
- ...to know he was aboard.
- Am I...considered the enemy?
You will be, if you remain un-obliging.
You'll appreciate the need for absolute discretion.
Of course.
How did you find me, Your Royal Highness?
The President of The Society For Speech Therapists.
Eileen McCleod?
[Laughs] She's a sport.
Dr McCleod warned me your antipodean methods were both "unorthodox" and "controversial."
I warned her those are not my favorite words.
I can cure your husband.
But for my method to work, I need trust and total equality, here in the safety of my consultation room.
No exceptions.
Oh, well then...
In that case...
When can you start?
[Indistinct Chattering]
- She's still sounding a bit rough, mate.
- You make me drive too slowly, Dad!
- Did you pick Mum up from bridge?
- Yeah, I've hardly been out of the car.
I had a special visitor this afternoon.
- [Boy] May I please leave the table?
- How special's special?
No, you must stay, bored stupid, listening to your parents' inane conversation.
- Thanks, Dad...
- And Mum.
- And Mum.
- Me, too.
- You meeting Jean?
- No.
Someone else.
- Doctor?
Doctor?
- Hmm?
Go and help your brother with the washing up.
- I'm fine.
- [Woman] Who is it, Lionel?
Why bring it up if you can't talk about it?
Myrtle, it's just a woman looking to help her husband.
Oh, and I had a call... for an audition.
- One of my favorites.
- Aren't they all?
It Could be a lot of fun.
[Door Shuts] I'm sure you'll be splendid.
In the amateur scene, they're a highly regarded group.
From Putney.
[Woman] No, that's all girls.
Tomorrow, chapter four, "The Flight."
[Girl] Mama, I long to know where they fly to.
- I can't wait!
- Oh, to fly away.
Weren't they lucky?
Now Papa, tell a story.
Can't I be a penguin instead?
[Girls Giggling]
Well, no, I want a penguin story.
Very quickly.
[Clears Throat]
Once there were...
[Stuttering] two princesses.
Princess Elizabeth and Princess Margaret, whose papa was a penguin.
This was because he'd been turned into one by a wicked witch.
This was very inconvenient for him because he loved to hold his princesses in his arms.
But you can't if you're a penguin because you...
- ...you have wings like herrings.
- Herrings don't have wings.
Penguins have wings which are...
are shaped like herrings.
And what made matters worse is that she... she sent him to the South Pole, which is an awfully long walk back if if you can't fly.
So when he reached the water, he he dived in, through the depths, so fast that he was in Southampton Waters by lunchtime.
And from there, he took the 2:30 to Weybridge, changed at Clapham Junction, asked a a passing mallard the way to Buckingham Palace, swam up The Thames, out through the plughole and gave the cook, Mama and Mrs. Whittaker quite a shock.
Now, when the girls heard all the commotion, they ran to the kitchen, where they gave him a a good scrub, a mackerel and a kiss.
And as they kissed him guess what he turned into?
- A handsome prince.
- A short-tailed albatross.
- [Disappointed] Oh.
- With wings so big, that he could wrap them both around his two girls together.
Now, girls.
Time for bed.
Come on.
- And take those horses to the stable.
- Quickly, now.
- You have exactly a minute.
- Good night.
Feed them, brush them and to bed.
- Will Mrs. Simpson be there?
- My brother's insisting.
- Is he serious?
- About her coming to dinner?
No.
About her.
- A married woman?
He can't be.
- She can.
By the way, I think I've found someone rather interesting.
On Harley Street.
A doctor.
Out of the question.
I'm not having this conversation again.
Mat...
Matter's settled.
Mmm.
His approach seems rather different.
[Indistinct Whispering]
Now?
Now.
Now is the winter of our discontent, made glorious summer by this sun of York.
And all the clouds that lour'd upon our house
In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.
Now are our brows bound with... victorious... wreaths;
Thank you.
- Lovely diction, Mr...?
- Logue.
Lionel Logue.
Well, Mr. Logue,
I'm not hearing the cries of a deformed creature yearning to be king.
Nor did I realize Richard III was King of the Colonies.
I do know all the lines.
I've played the role before.
- Sydney?
- Perth.
Major theater town, is it?
- Enthusiastic.
- Ah.
I was well reviewed.
Yes.
Well, Lionel, I think our dramatic society is looking for someone slightly younger.
And a...
little more regal.
- There you are.
- Thank you.
- Oh.
- Mmm.
No, you have to shut that one first.
Close that one first.
That's it.
Where did you find this... physician?
Classifieds.
Next to a "French model, Shepherd's Market."
No, he comes highly recommended.
Charges substantial fees to help the poor.
Oh, dear.
Perhaps he's a Bolshevik.
Ah, there's no receptionist.
Likes to keep things simple.
Uh...
The Johnsons.
You can go in now, Mr. Johnson.
Lionel says wait here if you wish, Mrs. Johnson.
Or, it being a...
[Stuttering] ... pleasant day...
P...perhaps take a stroll.
Was that all right, Lionel?
Marvelous, Willie.
You can stay here and wait for your mum.
Mrs. Johnson.
Mr. Johnson.
Do come in.
Would you like a sweetie?
He's a good lad, Willie.
He could hardly make a sound, you know, when he first came to me.
My boys make those.
They're good, aren't they?
Please, make yourself comfortable.
I was told not to sit too close.
Well I believe when speaking with a prince,
One waits for the prince to choose the topic.
[Stuttering]
Waiting for me to...
Ah, yes, well...
Do you know any jokes?
- Timing isn't my strong suit.
- [Chuckles] Cup of tea?
- No.
No, thank you.
- I think I'll have one.
[Lionel Humming]
Aren't you going to start treating me, Dr. Logue?
Only if you're interested in being treated.
Please, call me Lionel.
No, I... prefer Doctor.
I prefer Lionel.
- What will I call you?
- Your Royal Highness.
Then... it's "sir" after that.
It's a little bit formal for here.
I prefer names.
Prince Albert Frederick Arthur George?
How about Bertie?
- Only my family uses that.
- Perfect.
In here, it's better if we're equals.
If... if we were equals, I wouldn't be here.
I'd be... at home with my wife, and no one would give a damn.
Please, don't do that.
I'm sorry?
I believe sucking smoke into your lungs, well, it will kill you.
My physicians say it relaxes the...
- ...the throat.
- They're idiots.
- They've all been knighted.
- Makes it official, then.
My castle, my rules.
Thank you.
What was your earliest memory?
- What on earth do you mean?
- Your first recollection.
I'm not here to discuss personal matters.
- Well, why are you here, then?
- Because I bloody well stammer!
- You have a bit of a temper.
- One of my many faults.
- When did the defect start?
- I've always been this way.
- I doubt that.
- Don't...
- ...tell me, it's my stammer.
- It's my field.
I can assure you, no infant starts to speak with a stammer.
When did yours start?
- Four or five.
- That's typical.
So I've been told.
I...
I can't remember not doing it.
I can believe that.
Do you hesitate when you think?
- Don't be ridiculous.
- How about when you talk to yourself?
Everyone natters to themselves occasionally, Bertie.
Stop...
Stop calling me that.
I'm not going to call you anything else.
Then we shan't speak.
[Water Boiling]
[Blows Out Flame]
Are you charging for this, Doctor?
A fortune.
[Lionel Whistling]
I'll just let that brew.
So... when you talk to yourself, do you stammer?
No... of course not.
Well, that proves that your impediment isn't a permanent part of you.
What do you think was the cause?
I don't... don't know.
I...
I don't...
I don't care.
I...
I stammer.
No one can fix it.
I'll bet you that you can read flawlessly, right here, right now.
And if I win the bet, I get to ask you more questions.
- And if I win?
- You don't have to answer them.
One usually... wagers money.
A bob each to keep it sweet?
- Let's see your shilling.
- I don't... carry money.
I had a funny feeling you mightn't.
I'll stake you, and you can pay me back next time.
- If there is a next time.
- I haven't agreed to take you on yet.
So please stand, uh, and take a look at that.
From there.
I...
I can't read this.
Well, then you owe me a shilling for not trying.
[Stutters]
To be or not to be, that...
- Can't read it.
- Uh-uh-uh!
I haven't finished yet.
I'm going to record your voice and then play it back to you on the same machine.
This is brilliant.
It's the latest thing from America.
It's a Silvertone.
Pop these on.
There's a bob in this, mate.
You could go home rich.
[ ClassicalMusicPlaying]
- You're playing music!
- I know.
So how can I hear what I'm saying?
Well, surely a prince's brain knows what its mouth's doing?
You're not... well acquainted with royal princes, are you?
[ MusicPlaysLoudly]
[Voice Muffled]
Hopeless.
Hopeless!
You were sublime.
Would I lie to a prince of the realm to win 12 pennies?
I've no idea what an Australian might do for that sort of money.
Let me play it back to you.
No.
All right, then, well, I get to ask you the questions.
Thank you, Doctor.
I don't feel this is for me.
Thank you for your time.
Goodbye.
Sir?
The recording is free.
Please keep it as a souvenir.
No.
Oh, well.
[Whispering] Bugger.
[George V] For the present, the work to which we are all equally bound, is to arrive at a reasoned tranquility within our borders, ...to regain prosperity at this time of depression without self-seeking, and to carry with us
those whom the burden of the past years has disheartened or overborne.
To all, to each, I wish a happy Christmas.
God bless you.
[Man] And off air.
Easy when you know how.
[Man #2] Sir?
Have a go yourself.
- [Man] Congratulations, sir.
- [George V] Ah, Mr. Wood.
Splendid fellow.
Chap who taught me everything I know.
- Let the microphone do the work.
- Sir.
- Thank you.
- Gentlemen.
Sit up.
Straight back.
Face boldly up to the bloody thing and stare it square in the eye, as would any decent Englishman.
Show who's in command.
Papa, I d...don't... thu...thu...
think I c... c... can read this.
This devilish device will change everything if you don't.
In the past, all a king had to do was look respectable in uniform and not fall off his horse.
Now, we must invade people's homes and ingratiate ourselves with them.
This family's been reduced to those lowest, basest of all creatures.
We've become actors.
We're not a family, we're a firm.
Yet at any moment, some of us may be out of work.
Your darling brother and future king, the only wife he appears interested in is invariably the wife of another.
- He's broken off with Lady Furness.
- And taken up with Mrs. Simpson.
A woman with two husbands living.
I told him straight.
No divorced person can ever be received at court.
He said it made him sublimely happy.
[Scoffs]
I imagine that was because she was sleeping with him.
"I give you my word," this is what he said.
"I give you my word, we've never had immoral relations."
Stared square into his father's face and lied.
When I'm dead, that boy will ruin himself, this family and this nation within 12 months.
Who will pick up the pieces, hmm?
Herr Hitler intimidating half of Europe.
Marshal Stalin the other half.
Who will stand between us, the jackboots and the proletarian abyss?
You?
[Sighs] Well?
With your older brother shirking his duties, you're going to have to do a lot more of this.
Have a go yourself.
Through the...
[Stuttering] ...wireless...
- Get it out, boy.
...one of the m... marvels of m...
"Modern." Just take your time.
Form your words carefully.
...science I am enabled, this ...
Relax.
Just try it!
...this Christmas Day to speak to all my...
Do it!
[ AmbroseandHis Orchestra- Who's Been Polishing the Sun?
]
Lying... bastard.
[Needle Scratches On Record]
- [Bertie] You're playing music.
- [Lionel] I know.
[Bertie] So how can I...
hear what I'm saying?
[Lionel] Well, surely a prince's brain knows what its mouth's doing.
[Bertie] You're not... well acquainted with royal princes, are you?
"To be or not be, that is the question.
Whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, or to take arms against a sea of troubles, and by opposing end them?
To die, to sleep no more, and by a sleep to say the end is the heartache and the thousand natural shocks the flesh is heir to.
Tis a consummation hopeless."
Hopeless!
Strictly business.
No...
- ...personal nonsense.
- Yes, I thought I'd made that clear...
- ...in our interview.
- Have you got the shilling you owe me?
- No, I haven't.
- Didn't think so.
Besides, you... you tricked me.
Physical exercises and tricks are important, but what you're asking will only deal with the surface of the problem.
Is that sufficient?
Uh, no.
As far as I see it, my husband has mechanical difficulties with his speech.
- I...
- Maybe just deal with that.
I...
- I'm willing to work hard, Dr. Logue.
- Lionel.
[Stammering] Are you...
Are you willing to do your part?
All right.
You want mechanics?
We need to relax your jaw muscles, strengthen your tongue, by repeating tongue twisters.
For example, "I'm a thistle-sifter.
I have a sieve of sifted thistles and a sieve of unsifted thistles.
- Because I am a thistle-sifter."
- Fine.
And you do have a flabby tummy, so we'll need to spend some time strengthening your diaphragm.
Simple mechanics.
- That's all we ask.
- All that's about a shilling's worth.
Forget about the blessed shilling!
Perhaps, upon occasions you might be requested to assist in coping with with some minor event.
Would that be agreeable?
Of course.
Yes, and that would be the full extent of your services.
- Shall I see you next week?
- I shall see you every day.
[Both Vocalizing] Ahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahah.
Feel the looseness of the jaw.
[Vocalizing Continues]
Good.
Little bounces.
Bounces.
Shoulders loose, shoulders loose.
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful.
Now, loose.
[Lionel] Take a nice deep breath.
Expand the chest.
Put your hands onto your ribs.
Deeper.
Good.
- How do you feel?
- Full of hot air.
Isn't that what public speaking's all about?
My wife and I are glad to visit this important...
[Lionel] Take a good deep breath, and up comes Your Royal Highness.
And slowly exhale, and down comes Your Royal Highness.
- You all right, Bertie?
- [Groaning] Yes.
It's actually quite good fun.
Mmm...
Mother.
[Lionel] Shorten the humming each time.
Mother.
Mmm manufacturing district...
- [Lionel] Another deep breath.
- And Jack and Jill.
- [Bertie] Jack and Jill.
- [Lionel] Went up the hill.
- Went up the hill.
Now, just sway.
Perfect.
...will not permit us to...
- [Lionel] Loosen the shoulders.
[Bertie] Ding dong bell, pussy's in the well.
Who put her in?
Little Tommy Tin.
You have a short memory, Bertie.
Come on.
- A cow, a cow...
- A king.
A... a king...
[All Vocalizing]
Anyone who can shout vowels at an open window can learn to deliver a speech.
- Fourteen, 15!
- [Lionel] Good.
Deep breath, and...
It is...
- [Lionel] Let the words flow.
- No, it doesn't bloody work.
[Lionel] Come on, one more time, Bertie.
You can do it.
A sieve of thisted siphles.
Gah!
Mah!
Bah!
[Vocalizing]
[Lionel] Father.
- [Bertie] Father.
- [Lionel] Father.
- [Lionel] Aim for the a-t-h.
- Father.
- [Lionel] Father.
- Father.
Father.
Father.
[Airplane Approaching]
- Hello, Bertie.
- Hello, David.
- Nice of you to come out.
- Not at all.
You been waiting long?
Christ, bloody freezing.
Where have you been?
- I've been busy.
- So have I.
- Elizabeth has pneumonia.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- She'll recover.
- Father won't.
I'll drive.
Old bugger's doing this on purpose.
- Dying?
- Departing prematurely.
To...
To complicate matters with Wallis.
For heaven's sake, David.
You know how long he's been ill.
Wallis explained.
She's terribly clever about these things.
[Lord Wigram] Whereas my letters patent under the Great Seal bearing date of Westminster the 11th day of June 1912,
His Majesty King George the Fifth did constitute order and declare that there should be a Guardian...
- What's going on here?
- ...custos regne...
I cannot follow you.
I'm confused and I don't understand...
It's the Order of the Council of State, sir.
So that we may act on your behalf much clearer to me, I'm afraid...
- Well, I'm so confused that...
- Approved.
Thank you.
- [Man] Let me help you, sir.
- Ah, yes...
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.
- Feeling a little better, sir?
- No, I'm not feeling any better.
I feel dreadful.
Ah...
Been, uh, ice skating?
Ice skating?
No.
No, George.
[Clocks Ticking]
[David] Yes.
Yes, all right, of course.
I know, darling.
A talk, even a lovely long talk is a poor substitute for holding tight and making drowsy.
Nor making our own drowsies either, as we've had to do too often lately.
- [Bertie] David.
Dinner.
- I'm on with Wallis.
It's Bertie.
No.
No, it's not important.
[Groans] I don't want to.
No.
Telephone me later?
All right, goodbye.
[Hangs Up Phone]
- Wallis misses me terribly.
- Mama says you're late for dinner.
She forgets Papa's bloody clocks are all half an hour fast.
How's the King?
I...
I hope he's not in pain.
No, no, sir.
His Majesty's quieter now.
Thank you.
David, if your father were here, tardiness would not be tolerated.
None of this unpleasantness would be tolerated.
You know, sir, I appreciate that you are different from your father, both in outlook and... temperament.
I want you to know that whenever the King questioned your conduct,
I tried, in your interest, to present it in the most favorable light.
Mmm.
I can always trust you to have my best interests at heart.
[Whispering Indistinctly]
I fear our vigil will not be of long duration.
Please continue.
Let us commend our brother George to the mercy of God,
Our Maker and Redeemer.
Long live the King.
I hope I will make good as he has made good.
[Sobbing]
- What on earth was that?
- Poor Wallis.
Now, I'm trapped.
[Man On Radio] And in these last 25 crowded, troubled, glorious years, if there is one thing that King George has taught, it is the art of the leader who is also a brother to his followers.
As long as he lived, he was the guiding star of a great nation.
- Dad?
- Mmm-hmm?
- [Man] When he died...
- Time for a Shake, Dad?
[Radio]... the little children cried in the streets.
- You sure?
- Go on.
Put your thinking caps on.
- I bet it's the Scottish play.
- No, it's Othello.
It's always Othello.
[Lionel Groaning Theatrically]
Art thou afeard?
- Be not afeard.
- Caliban.
Oh, for heaven's sake.
That was a lucky guess.
Don't listen to egghead.
Go on, Dad.
The isle is full of noises, sounds and sweet airs that give delight, and hurt not.
Sometimes a thousand twangling instruments will hum about mine ears, and sometimes voices, that, if then I had waked after long sleep, will make me sleep again.
All right, clever clogs, so what comes next?
And then, in dreaming, methought the clouds would...
- The clouds methought.
- The clouds methought would open, and show riches ready to drop upon me, that when I waked, I cried to dream again.
That's such a sad thought.
[Knock On Door]
My next patient must be a bit early.
You better go, lads, I'm sorry.
Won't be a moment, Clifford.
Bertie?
They told me not to expect you.
I'm sorry about your father.
- I don't wish to intrude.
- Not at all.
Please, come in.
Come in.
I've been practicing.
An hour a day.
In spite of everything.
What's going on there?
Oh, I was...
Sorry.
Mucking around with my kids.
Do you feel like working today?
- A Curtis bi-plane.
- I'll put on some hot milk.
Logue.
Logue.
I'd kill for something stronger.
[Lionel] I wasn't there for my father's death.
- Still makes me sad.
- [Bertie] I can imagine so.
- What did your father do?
- He was a brewer.
At least there was free beer.
Here's to the memory of your father.
I was informed, after the fact, that my father's...
My father's last words were "Bertie has more guts than the rest of his brothers put together."
He couldn't say that to my face.
My brother.
What about him?
[Straining To Speak] [Lionel] Try singing it.
- I'm sorry.
- What songs do you know?
- Songs?
- Yeah, songs.
- "Swanee River."
- I love that song.
- It happens to be my favorite.
- Sing me the chorus.
No.
Certainly not.
You know...
I always wanted to build models.
But...
Father wouldn't allow it.
He... collected stamps, so we had to collect stamps.
You can finish that off if you sing.
"My brother David Dum, dum, dum, dum..."
- I'm not going to sit here warbling.
- You can with me.
- Because you're peculiar.
- I take that as a compliment.
Well...
Rules are rules.
I'm not... crooning "Swanee River".
"Camptown Races", then.
"My brother David said to me Doo-dah, doo-dah"
- Continuous sound will give you flow.
- No.
Does it feel strange now that David's on the throne?
To tell the truth, it was a relief.
Knowing I wouldn't be...
King.
But unless he produces an heir, you're next in line.
And your daughter, Elizabeth, would then succeed you.
"You're barking up the wrong tree now, Doctor, Doctor"
"Lionel"
See?
You didn't stammer.
Of course I didn't stammer, I was singing.
Well, as a little reward, you get to put some glue on these struts.
- Your boy... won't mind?
- No, not at all.
David and I were... very close.
Young bucks, you know.
Did you chase the same girls?
David was always very helpful in... arranging introductions.
We shared the expert ministrations
Of Paulette in the Palace.
Not at the same time, of course.
- Did David ever tease you?
- Oh, yes, they all did.
"Buh-buh-buh-Bertie."
Father encouraged it.
Said, "Get it out, boy!" Said it would make me stop.
He said, "I was afraid of my father and my children are...
damn well gonna be afraid of me!"
Are you naturally right-handed?
Left.
I was... punished, and now I use the right.
Yes, that's very common with stammerers.
- Any other corrections?
- Knock knees.
[Stammering] Metal splints were made.
Worn... worn day and night.
- Must have been painful.
- Bloody agony.
Straight legs now.
Who were you closest to in your family?
Nannies.
Not my first nanny.
She...
She loved David.
Hated me.
When we were presented to my parents for the daily viewing, she would... she'd pinch me so that I'd cry and be handed back to her immediately.
And then she would...
[Struggling To Speak] [Lionel] Sing it.
# Then she wouldn't feed me #
# Far, far away #
Took my parents...
three years to notice.
As you... as you can imagine, caused some stomach problems.
Still.
What about your brother, Johnnie?
Were you close to him?
Johnnie... sweet boy.
Had epilepsy.
And he was... different.
He died at... 13.
Hidden from view.
I'm...
I'm told it's not... catching.
Do you want a top-up?
Please.
[Bertie] You know Lionel, you're you're the first ordinary Englishman...
- Australian.
- ...
I've ever really spoken to.
When I'm... driven through the streets and I see the, you know, the common man staring at me, I I'm struck by how little I know of his life and how little he knows of mine.
- Thank you.
- What are friends for?
I wouldn't know.
[Bertie] I sifted seven thick-stalked thistles through a strong, thick sieve.
- I sifted seven thick-stalked...
- That's enough now, darling.
Listen, I have to keep doing this, it's awful.
I sifted seven...
- Oh, no.
- ...thick-stalked...
One-hundred-year-old spruces removed to improve the view?
Who does she think she is?
Nonetheless, we must try to be pleasant towards Mrs. Simpson.
- She calls me "The Fat Scottish Cook."
- You're not fat.
I'm getting plump.
Well, you seldom cook.
[Chuckles]
- I sifted seven...
- Shut up.
...thick sieves...
[Muffled] I sifted seven...
[Laughing]
[ Up-TempoMusicPlaying] Three, two, one and...
[Man] Their Royal Highnesses the Duke and Duchess of York.
Oh, how lovely to see you both.
Welcome to our little country shack.
I came at the invitation of the King.
Your Majesty.
- You all right?
- Sorry we're late.
Very nice to see you...
Mrs. Simpson.
Very nice.
Hello, David.
Making some changes to the garden, I see.
Yes, I'm not quite finished yet.
Don't tell me I behaved badly, Mr. Churchill.
On the contrary, Your Royal Highness.
Etiquette decrees that royalty should be greeted by the official host, in this case, the King.
Not a commoner.
Thank you.
- What is her hold on him?
- I've no idea.
Apparently, she has certain skills acquired in an establishment in Shanghai.
David.
Just be a sec, darling.
Would you excuse me?
- David, I've been trying to see you.
- I've been terribly busy.
- Doing what?
- Kinging.
Really?
Kinging is a a precarious business these days.
Where's the Russian tsar?
- Where's cousin Wilhelm?
- [Sighs] You're being dreary.
Is kinging laying off 80... staff and buying more pearls for Wallis, while people are marching across Europe singing The Red Flag?
- Herr Hitler will sort them out.
- Who will sort out Herr Hitler?
Where's the bloody 23?
And you put that woman in our mother's suite!
- Mama's not still in the bed, is she?
- That's not funny.
Here it is.
Wallis likes the very best.
I don't care what woman you carry on with at night, as long as you... show up for duty in the morning.
Wallis is not just some woman I'm carrying on with.
We intend to marry.
- Excuse me?
- She's filing a petition for divorce.
Good God.
Can't you just give her a nice house and a title?
- I'm not having her as my mistress.
- The Church doesn't recognize divorce,
- and you are the... head of the Church.
- Haven't I any rights?
- Many privileges.
- Not the same thing.
Your beloved common man may marry for love.
Why not me?
If you were... a common man,
On what basis could you...
possibly claim to be King?
Sounds like you've studied our wretched Constitution.
- Sounds like you haven't.
- That's what this is about.
Brushing up.
Hence, the elocution lessons.
- That's the scoop around town.
- I'm trying to...
Yearning for a larger audience, are we, B-B-Bertie?
Don't...
[Struggles To Speak] What's that?
I'm sorry, I...
Younger brother trying to push older brother off the throne.
P-P-Positively mediaeval.
[Pops Cork] Wallis.
Ah.
Where have you been all this time?
- Who have you been talking to?
- Never you mind.
[Sighs] What a very complicated little King you are.
I try to be.
[Wallis Chuckles]
All that work... down the drain.
My own brother.
I couldn't say a single word to him in reply.
Why do you stammer so much more with David than you ever do with me?
Because you're bloody well paid to listen.
- Bertie, I'm not a geisha girl.
- Stop trying to be so bloody clever.
What is it about David that stops you speaking?
What is it about you that bloody well makes you want to go on about him
- the whole bloody time?
- Vulgar but fluent.
- You don't stammer when you swear.
- Bugger off!
- Is that the best you can do?
- Well, bloody bugger to you, you beastly bastard.
Oh, a public school prig could do better than that.
Shit.
Shit, shit, shit.
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit!
Yes, defecation flows trippingly from the tongue.
- Because I'm angry!
- Do you know the "f" word?
- [Stammering] Fornication?
- Oh, Bertie.
Fuck.
Fuck!
Fuck, fuck, fuckin' fuck!
Fuck, fuck and bugger!
Bugger, bugger, buggedy, fuck!
- Fuck, ass!
- Yes!
- Balls, balls, fuckety shit.
- You see?
Not a hesitation.
Willy, shit and fuck!
And tits.
- Dad, what's going on?
- [Lionel] Sorry.
Just finish your homework.
Well, that's a side of you we don't get to see all that often.
No.
No, we're not supposed to, really.
Not publicly.
- Let's get some air.
- No, I don't think that's a good idea.
[Lionel] What's the matter?
Why are you so upset?
Logue, you have no idea.
My... my brother is infatuated with a woman who's been married twice.
She's asking for a divorce, and he's determined to marry her.
- Jesus.
- Mrs. Wallis Simpson...
- ...of Baltimore.
- That's not right.
- Queen Wallis of Baltimore.
- Unthinkable.
- Can he do it?
- Absolutely not.
But he's going to anyway.
All hell's broken loose.
- Can't they just carry on privately?
- If only they would.
Where does this leave you?
I know my place.
I...
I...
I will do anything in my power to keep my brother on the throne.
Is it that serious?
- Your place may well be on the throne.
- I am not an alternative to my brother.
- You can outshine David.
- Don't take liberties!
- That's bordering on treason.
- I'm just saying you could be King.
- You could do it.
- That is treason.
I'm trying to get you to realize you needn't be governed by fear.
I've had enough of this.
- What are you so afraid of?
- Your poisonous words!
Why did you come to me?
You're not some middle-class banker who wants elocution lessons so you can chitchat...
Don't attempt to instruct me on my duties!
I am the son of a...
King.
And the brother of... of a King.
You're the disappointing son of a brewer.
A jumped-up jackeroo from the outback.
You're a nobody.
These sessions are over.
[Man #1] Through here, sir.
[Man #2] It's not because she's an American.
That is the least of it.
It's because she's a soon to be twice divorced American.
And the King, as head of the Church of England, cannot marry a divorced woman.
And, sir, I apologize for the nature of this.
According to Scotland Yard, the King has not always possessed exclusive rights to Mrs. Simpson's...
favors and affections sharing them with a married used car salesman, a certain Mr. Guy Trundle.
[Coughs]
In addition, it is also rumored Hitler's ambassador,
Count von Ribbentrop, sends her 17 carnations every day.
Should His Majesty continue to ignore the advice of his government, he must abdicate.
Otherwise, his government has no choice but to resign.
Prime Minister, you'd leave a country without a a government?
Does the King do what he wants?
Or does he do what the people expect him to do?
[Man On Radio] As crowds in Downing Street watch ministers come and go, there is raised an age-old problem:
Can a king separate his personal life
- from his public duty...
- What's the matter, love?
I'm just having trouble with a patient.
[Myrtle] That isn't like you.
- Why?
- He's scared.
He's afraid of his own shadow.
Isn't that why they come to you?
This fellow could really be somebody great.
He's fighting me.
Perhaps he doesn't want to be great.
Perhaps that's what you want.
I might have overstepped the mark.
Apologize.
Do you both good.
[Footsteps Approaching]
I'm very sorry, Mr. Logue, the Duke is busy.
I'm happy to wait.
Or I could come back later.
As I said, the Duke is terribly busy.
[Door Opens]
Thank you.
Parliament will not support the marriage.
But there are other reasons for concern.
He was careless with state papers.
He lacked commitment and resolve, and there are those who are worried about where he will stand when war comes with Germany.
- We're not coming to that?
- Indeed we are, sir.
Prime Minister Baldwin may deny this, but Hitler's intent is crystal clear.
War with Germany will come.
And we will need a King whom we can all stand behind, united.
I fear my brother is not of sound mind at this time.
Have you thought what you will call yourself?
Hmm?
[Struggles To Speak]
Certainly not Albert, sir.
Too Germanic. [Chuckles]
[Stammering]
What about George?
After your father?
George the Sixth has a rather nice continuity to it.
Don't you think?
David.
Thank God.
[Door Shuts] You look exhausted.
How are you bearing up?
Bertie, the decision's been made.
I...
I'm going.
- I can't accept that...
- I'm afraid there's no other way.
I must marry her.
My mind's made up.
I'm... sorry.
That's a terrible thing to hear.
Nobody wants that.
I, least of all.
[David On Radio] At long last,
I am able to say a few words of my own.
I have never wanted to withhold anything, but until now it has not been constitutionally possible for me to speak.
A few hours ago, I discharged my last duty as King and Emperor, and now that I have been succeeded by my brother, the Duke of York, my first words must be to declare my allegiance to him.
This I do with all my heart.
You all know the reasons which have impelled me to renounce the throne, but you must believe me when I tell you that I have found it impossible to carry the heavy burden
Of responsibility and to discharge my duties as King, as I would wish to do without the help and support of the woman I love.
[Continuing On Radio] And I want you to know, this decision has been made less difficult to me by the sure knowledge that my brother, with his long training in the public affairs of this country,
and with his fine qualities, will be able to take my place forthwith without interruption or injury to the life and progress of the Empire.
[Bell Chimes]
[Doors Shut]
I meet you today in in circumstances which are...
[Struggling To Speak]
- [Elizabeth] I'm sure you'll love it.
- [Margaret] There you go.
Thank you, darling.
Saddles.
Margaret.
- There's Montezuma.
- Oh, here's one.
- Mama, here's a horse and saddle.
- Thank you.
Oops.
- Don't worry, Sally.
We'll get you...
- Mama?
- Yes?
- Will we have space for our horses...
- ...in our new home?
- Course we will, darling.
We'll have a palace of rooms.
[Whispers] Curtsey.
Your Majesty.
How was it?
[Bertie] I was trying to...
familiarize myself with... what a state paper looks like.
It's a dispatch from Mr. Baldwin, which I don't understand a word of.
David's finances.
[Chuckles] Christmas... broadcast.
- Think that would be a mistake.
- No, don't worry about that.
Oh.
Plans for the Coronation.
[Voice Breaking] Think that would be an even bigger mistake.
- [Crying] I'm not a King.
- Oh, shush.
I'm a Naval officer.
That's all I know.
I'm not a King.
I'm not a King.
- I'm sorry.
- No.
- I'm sorry.
- No, don't be silly.
Please.
[Sniffling]
Oh, my dear.
My dear, dear man.
- I'm sorry.
- You know,
I refused your first two marriage proposals, not because I didn't love you, but because I couldn't bear the idea of a Royal life.
Couldn't bear the idea of a life of tours, public duty, of...
Well, a life that no longer was really to be my own.
But then I thought, he stammers so beautifully, they'll leave us alone.
[Sniffles]
[Indistinct Chattering]
[Knocking On Door]
Waiting for a King to apologize, one can wait rather a long wait.
I'm afraid we're slightly late.
This is home.
Myrtle's at bridge.
I made sure the boys were out.
It's lovely.
Absolutely lovely.
- Oh!
May I sit down?
- Yes, of course.
- Would you like some tea, ma'am?
- Yes, I'll help myself.
Now, off you go.
Or must I knock your heads together?
Here's your shilling.
I...
I understand what you were trying to say, Logue.
I went about it the wrong way.
I'm sorry.
So, here I am.
Is the nation ready for two...
minutes of radio silence?
Every stammerer always fears going back to square one.
I don't let that happen.
If I fail in my duty,
David could come back.
I've seen the placards.
"God save our...
King."
They don't mean me.
Every monarch in history has succeeded someone who's dead
Or just about to be.
My predecessor is not only alive, but very much so.
It's a bloody mess.
Couldn't even give them a Christmas speech.
- Like your dad used to do?
- Precisely.
He's not here anymore.
Yes, he is.
He's on that shilling I gave you.
[Chuckles] Easy enough to give away.
You don't have to carry him around in your pocket.
Or your brother.
You don't need to be afraid of the things you were afraid of when you were five.
[Sighs]
You're very much your own man, Bertie.
Am I?
- Your face is next, mate.
- [Myrtle] Lionel, dear!
Myrtle.
- [Bertie] Is this your wife?
- [Lionel] Yes.
Bertie.
Come here.
- Are you all right, Logue?
- Yes.
- [Bertie] Shouldn't we go through?
- [Lionel] Trust me, it's important.
- [Bertie] What is it?
- Oh!
- You're...
- It's "Your Majesty" the first time.
After that, it's "Ma'am." As in "ham."
Not "malm" as in "palm."
I haven't told her about us.
Sit down, relax.
I'm told your husband calls my husband Bertie.
And my husband calls your husband Lionel.
I trust you won't call me Liz.
Your Majesty, you may call me Mrs. Logue, ma'am.
Very nice to meet you, Mrs. Logue.
- Logue, we can't stay here all day.
- Yes, we can.
- Logue!
- I need to wait for the right moment.
- Logue, you're being a coward.
- You're damn right.
Get out there, man.
Hello, Myrtle, darling.
You're early.
I believe you two have met, but I don't think you know king George the Sixth.
- It's very nice to meet you.
Will Their Majesties be staying to dinner?
We'd love to, such a treat, but alas a previous engagement.
What a pity.
- Archbishop.
- Welcome, Your Majesty.
What a glorious transformation, sir.
I hope you'll forgive us if we continue our preparations?
Now, allow me to guide you through the ceremony.
We begin, of course, at the West door into the nave.
I see all your pronouncements are to be broadcast, Archbishop.
Ah, yes.
Wireless.
It is, indeed, a Pandora's box, and I'm afraid I've also had to permit the newsreel cameras.
The product of which I shall personally edit.
Without momentary hesitations.
This is Dr. Logue of Harley Street.
He's... my speech therapist.
- Your Grace.
- Had I known that Your Majesty was seeking assistance, I should have made my own recommendation.
Dr. Logue will will be attending the Coronation.
Of course I'll speak to the Dean, but it will be extremely difficult.
I should like the doctor to be seated in the King's Box.
[Archbishop] But members of your family will be seated there, sir.
That is why it is suitable.
And now, if you don't mind, Your Grace, we need the premises.
My dear fellow, this is Westminster Abbey.
The Church must prepare His Majesty.
My preparations are equally as important.
With complete privacy, if you don't mind.
Those are my wishes, Your Grace.
I will place the Abbey at Your Majesty's disposal, this evening.
Your Majesty.
[Indistinct Murmuring]
I can't believe I'm walking on Chaucer and Handel and Dickens.
Everything all right?
Let's get cracking.
I'm not here to rehearse, Dr. Logue.
Call me Lionel.
True, you... never called yourself Doctor.
I did that for you.
No training.
No diploma, no qualifications.
Just... a great deal of nerve.
The Star Chamber inquisition, is it?
You asked for trust.
And... total equality.
Bertie, I heard you at Wembley.
I was there.
My son Laurie said, "Dad, do you think you could help that poor man?"
- What, as a failed actor?
- It's true.
I'm not a doctor.
And yes, I acted, a bit.
Well, I recited in pubs.
I taught elocution in schools.
When the Great War came, all our soldiers were returning to Australia from the front, a lot of them shell-shocked, unable to speak.
Somebody said, Lionel, "You're very good at this speech stuff.
Do you think you could possibly help these poor buggers?"
I did muscle therapy, exercises, relaxation, but I knew I had to go deeper.
Those poor young blokes had cried out in fear.
No one was listening to them.
My job was to give them faith in their own voice, and let them know that a friend was listening.
That must ring a few bells with you, Bertie.
You give a very noble account of yourself.
- Make inquiries.
It's all true.
- Inquiries have been made.
You have no idea who I have breathing down my neck.
I vouched for you, and you have no...
- ...credentials.
- But lots of success.
I can't show you a certificate.
There was no training then.
Everything I know, I know from experience.
And that war was some experience.
My plaque says, "L. Logue, Speech Defects."
Not "Doctor." There are no letters after my name.
- Lock me in the Tower.
- I would if I could.
- On what charge?
- Fraud.
With war looming, you've saddled this nation with a voiceless King.
You've destroyed the happiness of my family, all for the sake of ensnaring a star... patient you couldn't possibly hope to assist.
It'll be like mad King George the Third.
I'll be...
Mad King George the Stammerer who let his people down so badly in their hour of need.
What are you doing?
Get up!
You can't sit there!
Get up!
- Why not?
It's a chair.
- No, it...
That is not a chair!
That is...
That...
- That is Saint Edward's chair.
- People have carved their names on it.
That chair is the seat on which every King...
- It's held in place by a large rock.
- That is the Stone of Scone!
- You are trivializing everything.
- I don't care how many royal assholes
- ...have sat on this chair.
- Listen to me!
Listen to me!
- Listen to you?
By what right?
- By Divine Right, if you must.
- I am your King!
- No, you're not.
You told me so yourself.
You said you didn't want it.
Why should I waste my time listening to you?
Because I have a right to be heard!
I have a voice!
Yes, you do.
You have such perseverance, Bertie.
You're the bravest man I know.
You'll make a bloody good King.
- What on earth is going on, sir?
- It's quite all right, Archbishop.
Mr. Logue, you must know that
I've found a replacement English specialist with impeccable credentials.
Hence, your services will no longer be required.
- I'm sorry?
- Your Majesty's function is to consult and be advised.
Now, you didn't consult,
- ...but you have just been advised.
- And now I advise you.
In this personal matter, I will make my own decision.
My concern is for the head on which I must place the crown.
I appreciate that, Archbishop.
But it's my head.
Your humble servant.
Thank you, Bertie.
Shall we rehearse?
Come on.
Up on your perch.
Now, when you and Elizabeth enter through the West door, you will be greeted by the hymn "I was glad when they said unto me."
Actually, you won't be that glad because they do sing it for a very long time.
Then your friend, the Archbishop, will ponce up the stairs towards you, and say, "Sir, is Your Majesty willing to take the oath?"
- "I am willing."
- Well, of course you are.
I'm gonna see what this sounds like in the cheap seats, so even your old nanny can hear.
"Will you govern your peoples, Great Britain, Ireland, Canada,
Australia and New Zealand, according to their lands and customs?"
- "I SOLEMNLY PROMISE TO DO SO!"
- Louder.
- I can't hear you up the back.
- "I solemnly promise to do so."
Very good. "And will you, to your power, cause Law and Justice, in Mercy to be executed in all your judgments?"
"I will. [Louder] "I WILL!"
Then there's a very long bit about upholding the faith.
It goes on, rubbish, rubbish, rubbish, to which you finally say...
"The things which I have...
here before promised,
I will perform and keep.
So help me God."
And that's all you say.
Four short responses.
Kiss the book, sign the oath, and you're King.
Easy.
[Man On Film Speaks Indistinctly]
You nearly crowned him backwards, Archbishop.
Someone had removed the thread marking the back of the crown, sir.
Try not to lose the thread, Archbishop.
[Chuckles] Archbishop, we're missing Papa.
- [All] God save the King.
- Very good.
Very good, Archbishop.
Well, I hope Your Majesties are thrilled with the result.
- You can switch that machine off.
- No, wait.
Keep going.
- Nazism has held its great convention.
- Do take a seat, Archbishop.
Masses of uniformed men, stupefying to the eye, and incredible to the imagination have stood in spellbound audience of the Fuhrer.
[Speaking German]
- Papao Papa, what's he saying?
- [Bertie] Hmm?
I don't know, but he seems to be saying it rather well.
Sir...
I have asked to see you today in order to tender my resignation as Prime Minister.
I'm so sorry to hear that, Mr. Baldwin.
Neville Chamberlain will take my place as Prime Minister.
It's a matter of principle.
I was mistaken.
I have found it impossible to believe that there is any man in the world so lacking in moral feeling as Hitler, that the world may be hurled for a second time into the abyss of destructive war.
Churchill was right all along.
This was always Hitler's intention.
I'm only very sorry to leave you at this great time of crisis.
I'm very much afraid, sir, that your greatest test is yet to come.
[Chamberlain On Radio] I am speaking to you from the Cabinet room at 10 Downing Street.
This morning, the British ambassador in Berlin handed the German government a final note stating that unless we heard from them by 11:00, that they were prepared at once to withdraw their troops from Poland, ...a state of war would exist between us.
[Door Shuts]
I have to tell you now that no such undertaking has been received, and that, consequently, this country is at war with Germany.
At last, sir, here is your speech.
You are on air at six.
I have timed it to just under nine minutes.
The wording is fully approved.
The Prime Minister will be joining you for the broadcast, which will go out live across the nation, the Empire
- ...and to our armed forces.
- Get Logue here immediately.
- [Laurie] There's the barrage balloons.
- [Lionel] Yes.
- They got them up there quickly.
- Yeah.
[Air-Raid Siren Wails] [Indistinct Shouting]
- Shall we pull over and find a shelter?
- No, no.
Go straight there.
We'll be all right.
- Yes, sir?
- Lionel Logue.
Major Hartley is expecting me.
This is my son, Laurie.
- Thank you, Laurie.
- Good luck, Dad.
- The King's speech.
- Thank you, sir.
We have about 40 minutes to the broadcast.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
[Bertie] There may be dark days ahead and...
- Try again.
There may be dark days ahead, and...
Turn the hesitations into pauses and say to yourself, "God save the King."
I say that continuously, but apparently no one's listening.
Long pauses are good.
They add solemnity to great occasions.
Then I'm the solemnest king who ever lived.
You know, if I'm a king, where's my power?
Can I... can I form a government?
Can I... can I...
levy a tax?
Declare a... a war?
No.
And yet I'm the seat of all authority.
Why?
Because the nation believes that when I...
I speak,
I speak for them.
But I can't speak.
Let's take it all again from the top.
"In this grave hour."
[Clears Throat]
In this grave hour...
Fuck, fuck, fuck.
Perhaps the most fateful in our history...
Bugger, shit, shit.
I send to every household of my...
You see, "P" is always difficult, even when I'm singing.
Bounce on to it. "A peoples."
A people.
A people.
Household of my peoples, both at home
- ...and overseas.
- Beautiful.
This message...
Doo-dah
Spoken with the same depth of feeling, Doo-dah day, ...for each one of you, as if I were able to...
Shit, fuck, bugger!
...cross your threshold and speak to you...
In your head now. "I have a right to be bloody well heard."
Bloody well heard, bloody well heard myself!
Now, waltz.
Move.
Get continuous movement.
"For the second time in the lives of most of us...
- "We are at..." - [Lionel] "We are," take a pause.
- Lionel, I can't do this.
- Bertie, you can do it.
- Have a look at the last paragraph.
- Bertie.
It's time.
[Indistinct Chattering] There he is.
[Dog Barks]
- Archbishop.
- Your Majesty.
A great moment, Sir.
- Prime Minister.
- Your Majesty.
Nice to see you... again so soon.
Good of you to be here.
I'm sure you have had...
- ...a rather busy day.
- I hope we have no more interruptions...
- ...from those damn sirens, sir.
- Or the wretched dogs.
Congrat...
Congratulations.
- First Lord of the Admiralty.
- Your Majesty.
The long... walk.
Good luck, sir.
I, too, dread this apparatus.
Had a speech impediment myself, you know.
- I didn't.
- Family secret.
Tongue-tied.
An operation was considered to be too dangerous.
I eventually made an asset of it.
[Chuckles]
- Thank you, Mr. Churchill.
- Sir.
Darling.
- How long, Logue?
- Just under three minutes.
- Mr. Wood.
- Good luck, Your Majesty.
[Elizabeth] Mr. Wood.
- You've redecorated, Logue.
- I made it cozy.
- Some fresh air.
- There you are, darling.
I'm a thistle-sifter.
I've a sieve of sifted thistles and a sieve of unsifted thistles.
A sieve of sifted thistles and a sieve of unsifted thistles.
- [Clears Throat] Because I'm...
- Bertie.
Darling.
Make sure it's not switched on.
Remember, the red light will blink four times, then I've asked them to turn it off.
'Cause we don't want that evil eye staring at you all the way through.
[Man] One minute, sir.
I'm sure you'll be splendid.
Forty seconds, sir.
[Bertie] Logue.
However this turns out I don't know how to thank you...
for what you've done.
Knighthood?
[Man] Twenty seconds.
Forget everything else, and just say it to me.
Say it to me as a friend.
[Coughs]
[Muted]
In this grave hour perhaps the most fateful in our history I send to every household of my a- peoples both at home and overseas...
...this message spoken with the same depth of feeling for each one of you as if I were able to cross your threshold and speak to you... myself.
For the second time in the lives of most of us we are... at...
[Mouthing] Fuck, fuck, fuck!
...at war.
[Mouthing] Very good.
Over and over again we have tried to find a peaceful way out of the differences between ourselves and those who are now our... enemies.
But it has been... in vain.
We have been forced into a conflict, for we are called to meet the challenge of a principle, which, if it were to prevail, would be fatal to any civilized order in the world.
Such a principle, stripped of all disguise, is surely the mere primitive doctrine that might is right.
For the sake of all that we ourselves hold dear, it is unthinkable that we should refuse to meet the challenge.
It is to this high purpose that I now call my people at home, and my peoples across the seas, who will make our cause their own.
I ask them to stand calm and firm and united in this time of trial.
The task will be hard.
There may be dark days ahead, and war can no longer be confined to the battlefield.
But we can only do the right as we see the right, and reverently commit
Our cause to God.
If one and all we keep resolutely faithful to it, then, with God's help, we shall... prevail.
[Long Sigh] [Indistinct Murmuring]
It was very good, Bertie.
[Exhales]
You still stammered on the "W."
Well, I had to throw in a few, so they knew it was me.
Congratulations, Your Majesty.
A true broadcaster.
[Applause] Thank you, Mr. Wood.
- Congratulations, Your Majesty.
- Sir.
- Congratulations, Your Majesty.
- Thank you.
Ready.
- Good?
- Perfect, sir.
Your first wartime speech.
Congratulations.
I expect I shall have to...
do a great deal more.
Thank you, Logue.
Well done.
My friend.
Thank you Your Majesty.
[Doors Open]
I knew you'd be good.
Thank you...
Lionel.
Onwards.
- [Man #1] Congratulations, sir.
- [Man #2] Well done, sir.
Couldn't have said it better myself, sir.
Your Majesty, I am speechless.
- Congratulations, sir.
- Gentlemen.
- So how was Papa, Elizabeth?
- Halting at first,
- But you got much better, Papa.
- Well, bless you.
- And how about you, Margaret?
- You were just splendid, Papa.
Of course I was.
Are we all ready?
[Elizabeth] Come on, girls.
[Crowd Cheering]
You're live in two minutes, Your Royal Highness.
Sir?
Thank you.
Let the microphone do the work, sir.
I'm sure you'll be splendid.
Just take your time.
Time to go.
Good afternoon.
This is the BBC National Programme and Empire Service taking you to Wembley Stadium for the closing ceremony of the Empire Exhibition, where His Royal Highness, the Duke of York, will read a message from his father, His Majesty King George V.
Fifty-eight British colonies and dominions have taken part, making this the largest exhibition staged anywhere in the world.
Remember, sir, three flashes, then steady red means you're live.
Using the new invention of radio, the opening ceremony was the first time His Majesty the King addressed his subjects on the wireless.
At the close of the first season, the heir to the throne, His Royal Highness, the Prince of Wales, made his first broadcast, and today, his younger brother, His Royal Highness, the Duke of York,
will give his inaugural broadcast to the nation and the world.
I have received from His Majesty the the the the King...
Inhale deep into your lungs, Your Royal Highness.
Relaxes your larynx, does it not?
Cigarette smoking calms the nerves, and gives you Confidence.
Now, if Your Royal Highness would be so kind as to open your hand.
Sterilized.
One, two, three, four, five, six seven.
Now, if I may take the liberty, insert them into your mouth.
Excuse me, Doctor.
What is the purpose of this?
It's the classic approach.
It cured Demosthenes.
That was in Ancient Greece.
Has it worked since?
Now, if you would be so kind as to read.
"A wealth of words."
Fight against those marbles, Your Royal Highness.
Enunciate.
A little more concentration, Your Royal Highness.
I nearly swallowed the bloody things!
Thank you so much, Doctor.
It's been most, um...
- ...interesting.
- Your Royal Highness.
Insert marbles.
He can insert his own bloody marbles.
Tick, took.
Tick, took.
You know you can't keep doing this, Bertie.
- I know.
- Mmm.
Promise me...
Promise me no more.
Ah!
Hello?
- Is anyone there?
- I'm just in the loo.
Ah, Mrs. Johnson, there you are.
I'm sorry, I don't have a receptionist.
I like to keep things simple.
"Poor and content is rich and rich enough."
- I'm sorry?
- Shakespeare.
How are you?
- How do you do?
- Oh, chuffing along.
Um, now, this is slightly awkward, but I'm afraid you're late.
- Yes.
I'm afraid I am.
- Where's Mr. Johnson?
Ah...
He doesn't know I'm here.
Well, that's not a very promising start.
No.
No, look, my husband has seen everyone.
To no avail.
I'm awfully afraid he's given up hope.
- He hasn't seen me.
- Awfully sure of yourself.
Well, I'm sure of anyone who wants to be cured.
Of course he wants to be cured.
My husband is, um...
- Well, he's required to speak publicly.
- Perhaps he should change jobs.
- He can't.
- Indentured servitude?
Something of that nature, yes.
Well, we need to have your hubby pop by.
Uh...
Tuesday would be good.
He can give me his personal details, I'll make a frank appraisal
- and then we'll take it from there.
- Doctor, forgive me.
Uh, I don't have a "hubby." We don't "pop."
And nor do we ever talk about our private lives.
No, you must come to us.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Johnson, my game, my turf, my rules.
Mmm.
You'll have to talk this over with your husband, and then you can speak to me on the telephone.
Thank you very much for dropping by.
Good afternoon.
And what if my husband were the Duke of York?
- The Duke of York?
- Yes.
The Duke of York.
I thought the appointment was for Johnson.
Forgive me, Your...
- Royal Highness.
- ...
Royal Highness.
Yes, Johnson was used during the Great War, when the Navy didn't want the enemy
- to know he was aboard.
- Am I considered the enemy?
You will be, if you remain un-obliging.
You'll appreciate the need for absolute discretion.
Of course.
How did you find me, Your Royal Highness?
The President of The Society For Speech Therapists.
Eileen McCleod?
She's a sport.
She warned me your Antipodean methods were both "unorthodox" and "controversial."
I warned her those are not my favorite words.
I can cure your husband.
But for my method to work,
I need trust and total equality, here in the safety of my consultation room.
No exceptions.
Oh, well.
In that case...
When can you start?
- She's still sounding a bit rough.
- You make me drive too slowly, Dad.
- Did you pick Mum up from bridge?
- Yeah, I've hardly been out of the car.
I had a special visitor this afternoon.
- May I please leave the table?
- How special's special?
You must stay, bored stupid, listening to your parents' inane conversation.
- Thanks, Dad.
- And Mum.
- And Mum.
- Me, too.
- You meeting Jean?
- No.
Someone else.
- Doctor?
Doctor?
- Hmm?
Go and help your brother with the washing up.
- I'm fine.
- Who is it, Lionel?
Why bring it up if you can't talk about it?
Myrtle, it's just a woman looking to help her husband.
Oh, and I had a call... for an audition.
- One of my favorites.
- Aren't they all?
Could be a lot of fun.
I'm sure you'll be splendid.
In the amateur scene, they're a highly regarded group.
From Putney.
No, that's all girls.
Tomorrow, chapter four, "The Flight."
Mama, I long to know where they fly to.
- I can't wait!
- Oh, to fly away.
Weren't they lucky?
Now Papa, tell a story.
Can't I be a penguin instead?
Well, no, I want a penguin story.
Very quickly.
Once there were...
two princesses.
Princess Elizabeth and Princess Margaret, whose papa was a penguin.
This was because he'd been turned into one by a wicked witch.
This was very inconvenient for him because he loved to hold his princesses in his arms.
But you can't if you're a penguin because you...
- ...you have wings like herrings.
- Herrings don't have wings.
Penguins have wings which are...
are shaped like herrings.
And what made matters worse is that she... she sent him to the South Pole, which is an awfully long walk back if if you can't fly.
So when he reached the water, he he dived in, through the depths, so fast that he was in Southampton Waters by lunchtime.
And from there, he took the 2:30 to Weybridge, changed at Clapham Junction, asked a a passing mallard the way to Buckingham Palace, swam up The Thames, out through the plughole and gave the cook, Mama and Mrs. Whittaker quite a shock.
Now, when the girls heard all the commotion, they ran to the kitchen, where they gave him a a good scrub, a mackerel and a kiss.
And as they kissed him guess what he turned into?
- A handsome prince.
- A short-tailed albatross.
- Oh.
- With wings so big, that he could wrap them both around his two girls together.
Now, girls.
Time for bed.
Come on.
- And take those horses to the stable.
- Quickly, now.
- You have exactly a minute.
- Good night.
Feed them, brush them and to bed.
- Will Mrs. Simpson be there?
- My brother's insisting.
- Is he serious?
- About her coming to dinner?
No.
About her.
- A married woman?
He can't be.
- She can.
By the way, I think I've found someone rather interesting.
On Harley Street.
Doctor.
Out of the question.
I'm not having this conversation again.
Mat...
Matter's settled.
Mmm.
His approach seems rather different.
Now?
Now.
Now is the winter of our discontent, made glorious summer by this sun of York.
And all the clouds that lour'd upon our house in the deep bosom of the ocean buried.
Now are our brows bound with... victorious...
Thank you.
- Lovely diction, Mr...
- Logue.
Lionel Logue.
Well, Mr. Logue,
I'm not hearing the cries of a deformed creature yearning to be king.
Nor did I realize Richard III was King of the Colonies.
I do know all the lines.
I've played the role before.
- Sydney?
- Perth.
Major theater town, is it?
- Enthusiastic.
- Ah.
I was well reviewed.
Yes.
Well, Lionel, I think our dramatic society is looking for someone slightly younger.
And a...
little more regal.
- There you are.
- Thank you.
- Oh.
- Mmm.
No, you have to shut that one first.
Close that one first.
That's it.
Where did you find this... physician?
Classifieds.
Next to a "French model, Shepherd's Market."
No, he comes highly recommended.
Charges substantial fees to help the poor.
Oh, dear.
Perhaps he's a Bolshevik.
Ah, there's no receptionist.
Likes to keep things simple.
Uh...
The Johnsons.
You can go in now, Mr. Johnson.
Lionel says wait here if you wish, Mrs. Johnson.
Or, it being a pleasant day perhaps take a stroll.
Was that all right, Lionel?
Marvelous, Willie.
You can stay here and wait for your mum.
Mrs. Johnson.
Mr. Johnson.
Do come in.
Would you like a sweetie?
He's a good lad, Willie.
He could hardly make a sound, you know, when he first came to me.
My boys make those.
They're good, aren't they?
Please, make yourself comfortable.
I was told not to sit too close.
I believe when speaking with a prince, one waits for the prince to choose the topic.
Waiting for me to...
Ah, yes, well...
Do you know any jokes?
- Timing isn't my strong suit.
- Cup of tea?
- No.
No, thank you.
- I think I'll have one.
Aren't you going to start treating me, Dr. Logue?
Only if you're interested in being treated.
Please, call me Lionel.
No, I... prefer Doctor.
I prefer Lionel.
- What will I call you?
- Your Royal Highness.
Then... it's "sir" after that.
It's a little bit formal for here.
I prefer names.
Prince Albert Frederick Arthur George.
How about Bertie?
- Only my family uses that.
- Perfect.
In here, it's better if we're equals.
If... if we were equals, I wouldn't be here.
I'd be... at home with my wife, and no one would give a damn.
Please, don't do that.
I'm sorry?
I believe sucking smoke into your lungs, well, it will kill you.
My physicians say it relaxes the...
- ...the throat.
- They're idiots.
- They've all been knighted.
- Makes it official, then.
My castle, my rules.
Thank you.
What was your earliest memory?
- What on earth do you mean?
- Your first recollection.
I'm not here to discuss personal matters.
- Well, why are you here, then?
- Because I bloody well stammer!
- You have a bit of a temper.
- One of my many faults.
- When did the defect start?
- I've always been this way.
- I doubt that.
- Don't...
- ...tell me, it's my stammer.
- It's my field.
I can assure you, no infant starts to speak with a stammer.
When did yours start?
- Four or five.
- That's typical.
So I've been told.
I...
I can't remember not doing it.
I can believe that.
Do you hesitate when you think?
- Don't be ridiculous.
- How about when you talk to yourself?
Everyone natters to themselves occasionally, Bertie.
Stop...
Stop calling me that.
I'm not going to call you anything else.
Then we shan't speak.
Are you charging for this, Doctor?
A fortune.
I'll just let that brew.
So... when you talk to yourself, do you stammer?
No... of course not.
Well, that proves that your impediment isn't a permanent part of you.
What do you think was the cause?
I don't... don't know.
I...
I don't...
I don't care.
I...
I stammer.
No one can fix it.
I'll bet you that you can read flawlessly, right here, right now.
And if I win the bet, I get to ask you more questions.
- And if I win?
- You don't have to answer them.
One usually... wagers money.
A bob each to keep it sweet?
- Let's see your shilling.
- I don't... carry money.
I had a funny feeling you mightn't.
I'll stake you, and you can pay me back next time.
- If there is a next time.
- I haven't agreed to take you on yet.
So please stand, uh, and take a look at that.
From there.
I...
I can't read this.
Well, then you owe me a shilling for not trying.
To be or not to be, that...
- Can't read it.
- Uh-uh-uh!
I haven't finished yet.
I'm going to record your voice and then play it back to you on the same machine.
This is brilliant.
it's the latest thing from America.
It's a Silvertone.
Pop these on.
There's a bob in this, mate.
You could go home rich.
- You're playing music!
- I know.
So how can I hear what I'm saying?
Well, surely a prince's brain knows what its mouth's doing?
You're not... well acquainted with royal princes, are you?
Hopeless.
Hopeless!
You were sublime.
Would I lie to a prince of the realm to win 12 pennies?
I've no idea what an Australian might do for that sort of money.
Let me play it back to you.
No.
All right, then, well, I get to ask you the questions.
Thank you, Doctor.
I don't feel this is for me.
Thank you for your time.
Goodbye.
Sir.
The recording is free.
Please keep it as a souvenir.
No.
Oh, well.
Bugger.
For the present, the work to which we are all equally bound is to arrive at a reasoned tranquility within our borders, to regain prosperity at this time of depression without self-seeking, and to carry with us those whom the burden of the past years
has disheartened or overborne.
To all, to each, I wish a happy Christmas.
God bless you.
And off air.
Easy when you know how.
Sir?
Have a go yourself.
- Congratulations, sir.
- Ah, Mr. Wood.
Splendid fellow.
Chap who taught me everything I know.
- Let the microphone do the work.
- Sir.
- Thank you.
- Gentlemen.
Sit up.
Straight back.
Face boldly up to the bloody thing and stare it square in the eye, as would any decent Englishman.
Show who's in command.
Papa, I don't... think I can read this.
This devilish device will change everything if you don't.
In the past, all a king had to do was look respectable in uniform and not fall off his horse.
Now, we must invade people's homes and ingratiate ourselves with them.
This family's been reduced to those lowest, basest of all creatures.
We've become actors.
We're not a family, We're a firm.
Yet at any moment, some of us may be out of work.
Your darling brother and future king, the only wife he appears interested in is invariably the wife of another.
- He's broken off with Lady Furness.
- And taken up with Mrs. Simpson.
A woman with two husbands living.
I told him straight.
No divorced person can ever be received at court.
He said it made him sublimely happy.
I imagine that was because she was sleeping with him.
"I give you my word," this is what he said.
"I give you my word, we've never had immoral relations."
Stared square into his father's face and lied.
When I'm dead, that boy will ruin himself, this family and this nation within 12 months.
Who will pick up the pieces, hmm?
Herr Hitler intimidating half of Europe.
Marshal Stalin the other half.
Who will stand between us, the jackboots and the proletarian abyss?
You?
Well?
With your older brother shirking his duties, you're going to have to do a lot more of this.
Have a go yourself.
Through the...
- ...wireless...
- Get it out, boy.
...one of the marvels of...
"Modern." Just take your time.
Form your words carefully.
...science I am enabled...
Relax.
Just try it!
...this Christmas Day to speak to all my...
Do it!
Who 's Been Polishing the Sun ?
Lying... bastard.
- You're playing music.
- I know.
So how can I...
hear what I'm saying?
Well, surely a prince's brain knows what its mouth 's doing.
You're not... well acquainted with royal princes, are you?
"To be or not be, that is the question.
Whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, or to take arms against a sea of troubles, and by opposing end them ?
To die, to sleep no more, and by a sleep to say the end is the heartache and the thousand natural shocks the flesh is heir to.
Tis a consummation hopeless. "
Hopeless!
Strictly business.
No...
- ...personal nonsense.
- Yes, I thought I'd made that clear
- in our interview.
- Have you got the shilling you owe me?
- No, I haven't.
- Didn't think so.
Besides, you... you tricked me.
Physical exercises and tricks are important, but what you're asking will only deal with the surface of the problem.
Is that sufficient?
Uh, no.
As far as I see it, my husband has mechanical difficulties with his speech.
- I...
- Maybe just deal with that.
- I'm willing to work hard, Dr. Logue.
- Lionel.
Are you...
Are you willing to do your part?
All right.
You want mechanics?
We need to relax your jaw muscles, strengthen your tongue, by repeating tongue twisters.
For example, "I'm a thistle-sifter.
I have a sieve of sifted thistles and a sieve of unsifted thistles.
- Because I am a thistle-sifter."
- Fine.
And you do have a flabby tummy, so we'll need to spend some time strengthening your diaphragm.
Simple mechanics.
- That's all we ask.
- All that's about a shilling's worth.
Forget about the blessed shilling!
Perhaps, upon occasions you might be requested to assist in coping with with some minor event.
Would that be agreeable?
Of course.
Yes, and that would be the full extent of your services.
- Shall I see you next week?
- I shall see you every day.
Feel the looseness of the jaw.
Good.
Little bounces.
Bounces.
Shoulders loose, shoulders loose.
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful.
Now, loose.
Take a nice deep breath.
Expand the chest.
Put your hands onto your ribs.
Deeper.
Good.
- How do you feel?
- Full of hot air.
Isn't that what public speakings all about?
My wife and I are glad to visit this important...
Take a good deep breath, and up comes Your Royal Highness.
And slowly exhale, and down comes Your Royal Highness.
- You all right, Bertie?
- Yes.
It's actually quite good fun.
Mmm...
Mother.
Shorten the humming each time.
Mother.
Mmm...
- ...manufacturing district...
- Another deep breath.
- And Jack and Jill.
- Jack and Jill.
- Went up the hill.
- Went up the hill.
Now, just sway.
Perfect.
- ...will not permit us to...
- Loosen the shoulders.
Ding dong bell, pussy's in the well.
Who put her in?
Little Tommy Tin.
You have a short memory, Bertie.
Come on.
- A cow, a cow...
- A king.
A... a king...
Anyone who can shout vowels at an open window can learn to deliver a speech.
- Fourteen, 15!
- Good.
Deep breath, and...
It is...
- Let the words flow.
- No, it doesn't bloody work.
Come on, one more time, Bertie.
You can do it.
A sieve of thisted siphles.
Gah!
Mah!
Bah!
Father.
- Father.
- Father.
- Aim for the a-t-h.
- Father.
- Father.
- Father.
Father.
Father.
- Hello, Bertie.
- Hello, David.
- Nice of you to come out.
- Not at all.
You been waiting long?
Christ, bloody freezing.
Where have you been?
- I've been busy.
- So have I.
- Elizabeth has pneumonia.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- She'll recover.
- Father won't.
I'll drive.
Old bugger's doing this on purpose.
- Dying?
- Departing prematurely.
To...
To complicate matters with Wallis.
For heaven's sake, David.
You know how long he's been ill.
Wallis explained.
She's terribly clever about these things.
Whereas my letters patent under the Great Seal bearing date of Westminster the 11th day of June 1912,
His Majesty King George the Fifth did constitute order and declare that there should be a Guardian...
- What's going on here?
- ...custos regne...
I cannot follow you.
I'm confused and I don't understand... it's the Order of the Council of State, sir.
So that we may act on your behalf much clearer to me, I'm afraid...
- Well, I'm so confused that...
- Approved.
Thank you.
- Let me help you, sir.
- Ah, yes...
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.
- Feeling a little better, sir?
- No, I'm not feeling any better.
I feel dreadful.
Ah...
Been, uh, ice skating?
Ice skating?
No.
No, George.
Yes.
Yes, all right, of course.
I know, darling.
A talk, even a lovely long talk is a poor substitute for holding tight and making drowsy.
Nor making our own drowsies either, as we've had to do too often lately.
- David.
Dinner.
- I'm on with Wallis.
It's Bertie.
No.
No, it's not important.
I don't want to.
No.
Telephone me later?
All right, goodbye.
- Wallis misses me terribly.
- Mama says you're late for dinner.
She forgets Papa's bloody clocks are all half an hour fast.
How's the King?
I...
I hope he's not in pain.
No, no, sir.
His Majesty's quieter now.
Thank you.
David, if your father were here, tardiness would not be tolerated.
None of this unpleasantness would be tolerated.
You know, sir, I appreciate that you are different from your father, both in outlook and... temperament.
I want you to know that whenever the King questioned your conduct,
I tried, in your interest, to present it in the most favorable light.
Mmm.
I can always trust you to have my best interests at heart.
I fear our vigil will not be of long duration.
Please continue.
Let us commend our brother George to the mercy of God, our Maker and Redeemer.
Long live the King.
I hope I will make good as he has made good.
- What on earth was that?
- Poor Wallis.
Now, I'm trapped.
And in these last 25 crowded, troubled, glorious years, if there is one thing that King George has taught, it is the art of the leader who is also e brother to his followers.
As long as he lived, he was the guiding star of a great nation.
- Dad?
- Mmm-hmm?
- When he died...
- Time for a Shake, Dad?
...the little children cried in the streets.
- You sure?
- Go on.
Put your thinking caps on.
- I bet it's the Scottish play.
- No, it's Othello. it's always Othello.
Art thou afeard?
- Be not afeard.
- Caliban.
Oh, for heaven's sake.
That was a lucky guess.
Don't listen to egghead.
Go on, Dad.
The isle is full of noises, sounds and sweet airs that give delight, and hurt not.
Sometimes a thousand twangling instruments will hum about mine ears, and sometimes voices, that, if then I had waked after long sleep, will make me sleep again.
All right, clever clogs, so what comes next?
And then, in dreaming, methought the clouds would...
- The clouds methought.
- The clouds methought would open, and show riches ready to drop upon me, that when I waked, I cried to dream again.
That's such a sad thought.
My next patient must be a bit early.
You better go, lads, I'm sorry.
Won't be a moment, Clifford.
Bertie?
They told me not to expect you.
I'm sorry about your father.
- I don't wish to intrude.
- Not at all.
Please, come in.
Come in.
I've been practicing.
An hour a day.
In spite of everything.
What's going on there?
Oh, I was...
Sorry.
Mucking around with my kids.
Do you feel like working today?
- Curtis biplane.
- I'll put on some hot milk.
Logue.Logue.
I'd kill for something stronger.
I wasn't there for my father's death.
- Still makes me sad.
- I can imagine so.
- What did your father do?
- He was a brewer.
At least there was free beer.
Here's to the memory of your father.
I was informed, after the fact, that my father's...
My father's last words were "Bertie has more guts than the rest of his brothers put together."
Couldn't say that to my face.
My brother.
What about him?
Try singing it.
- I'm sorry?
- What songs do you know?
- Songs?
- Yeah, songs.
- Swanee Riven
- I love that song.
- It happens to be my favorite.
- Sing me the chorus.
No.
Certainly not.
You know...
I always wanted to build models.
But...
Father wouldn't allow it.
He... collected stamps, so we had to collect stamps.
You can finish that off if you sing.
♪ My brother David Dum, dum, dum, dum... ♪

Camptown Races, then.
J' My brother David said to me
♪ Doo-dah, doo-dah ♪
- Continuous sound will give you flow.
- No.
Does it feel strange now that David's on the throne?
To tell the truth, it was a relief.
Knowing I wouldn't be...
King.
But unless he produces an heir, you're next in line.
And your daughter, Elizabeth, would then succeed you.

See?
You didn't stammer.
Of course I didn't stammer, I was singing.
Well, as a little reward, you get to put some glue on these struts.
- Your boy... won't mind?
- No, not at all.
David and I were... very close.
Young bucks, you know.
Did you chase the same girls?
David was always very helpful in... arranging introductions.
We shared the expert ministrations of Paulette in the Palace.
Not at the same time, of course.
- Did David ever tease you?
- Oh, yes, they all did.
"B-B-B-Bertie."
Father encouraged it.
Said, "Get it out, boy!" Said it would make me stop.
He said, "l was afraid of my father and my children are...
damn well gonna be afraid of me!"
Are you naturally right-handed?
Left.
I was... punished, and now I use the right.
Yes, that's very common with stammerers.
- Any other corrections?
- Knock knees.
Metal splints were made.
Worn... worn day and night.
- Must have been painful.
- Bloody agony.
Straight legs now.
Who were you closest to in your family?
Nannies.
Not my first nanny.
She...
She loved David.
Hated me.
When we were presented to my parents for the daily viewing, she would... she'd pinch me so that I'd cry and be handed back to her immediately.
And then she would...

Do you want a top-up?
Please.
You know Lionel, you're you're the first ordinary Englishman...
- Australian.

I've ever really spoken to.
When I'm... driven through the streets and I see the, you know, the common man staring at me, I I'm struck by how little I know of his life and how little he knows of mine.
- Thank you.
- What are friends for?
I wouldn't know.
I sifted seven thick-stalked thistles through a strong, thick sieve.
- I sifted seven thick-stalked...
- That's enough now, darling.
Listen, I have to keep doing this, it's awful.
I sifted seven...
- Oh, no.
- ...thick-stalked...
One-hundred-year-old spruces removed to improve the view?
Who does she think she is?
Nonetheless, we must try to be pleasant towards Mrs. Simpson.
- She calls me "The Fat Scottish Cook."
- You're not fat.
I'm getting plump.
Well, you seldom cook.
- I sifted seven...
- Shut up.
...thick sieves...
I sifted seven...
Three, two, one and...
Their Royal Highnesses the Duke and Duchess of York.
Oh, how lovely to see you both.
Welcome to our little country shack.
I came at the invitation of the King.
Your Majesty.
- You all right?
- Sorry we're late.
Very nice to see you...
Mrs. Simpson.
Very nice.
Hello, David.
Making some changes to the garden, I see.
Yes, I'm not quite finished yet.
Don't tell me I behaved badly, Mr. Churchill.
On the contrary, Your Royal Highness.
Etiquette decrees that royalty should be greeted by the official host, in this case, the King.
Not a commoner.
Thank you.
- What is her hold on him?
- I've no idea.
Apparently, she has certain skills acquired in an establishment in Shanghai.
David.
Just be a sec, darling.
Would you excuse me?
- David, I've been trying to see you.
- I've been terribly busy.
- Doing what?
- Kinging.
Really?
Kinging is a a precarious business these days.
Where's the Russian tsar?
- Where's cousin Wilhelm?
- You're being dreary.
Ls kinging laying off 80... staff and buying more pearls for Wallis, while people are marching across Europe singing The Red Flag?
- Herr Hitler will sort them out.
- Who will sort out Herr Hitler?
Where's the bloody 23?
And you put that woman in our mother's suite!
- Mama's not still in the bed, is she?
- That's not funny.
Here it is.
Wallis likes the very best.
I don't care what woman you carry on with at night, as long as you... show up for duty in the morning.
Wallis is not just some woman I'm carrying on with.
We intend to marry.
- Excuse me?
- She's filing a petition for divorce.
Good God.
Can't you just give her a nice house and a title?
- I'm not having her as my mistress.
- The Church doesn't recognize divorce,
- and you are the... head of the Church.
- Haven't I any rights?
- Many privileges.
- Not the same thing.
Your beloved common man may marry for love.
Why not me?
If you were... a common man, on what basis could you...
possibly claim to be King?
Sounds like you've studied our wretched Constitution.
- Sounds like you haven't.
- That's what this is about.
Brushing up.
Hence, the elocution lessons.
- That's the scoop around town.
- I'm trying to...
Yearning for a larger audience, are we, B-B-Bertie?
Don't. ..
What's that?
I'm sorry, I...
Younger brother trying to push older brother off the throne.
P-P-Positively mediaeval.
Wallis.
Ah.
Where have you been all this time?
- Who have you been talking to?
- Never you mind.
What a very complicated little King you are.
I try to be.
All that work... down the drain.
My own brother.
I couldn't say a single word to him in reply.
Why do you stammer so much more with David than you ever do with me?
Because you're bloody well paid to listen.
- Bertie, I'm not a geisha girl.
- Stop trying to be so bloody clever.
What is it about David that stops you speaking?
What is it about you that bloody well makes you want to go on about him
-the whole bloody time?
- Vulgar but fluent.
- You don't stammer when you swear.
- Bugger off!
- ls that the best you can do?
- Well, bloody bugger to you, you beastly bastard.
Oh, a public school prig could do better than that.
Shit.
Shit, Shit, Shit.
Shit, Shit, Shit, Shit, Shit, Shit!
Yes, defecation flows trippingly from the tongue.
- Because I'm angry!
- Do you know the "f" word?
- Fornication?
- Oh, Bertie.
Fuck.
Fuck!
Fuck, fuck, fuckin' fuck!
Fuck, fuck and bugger!
Bugger, bugger, buggedy, fuck!
- Fuck, ass!
- Yes!
- Balls, balls, fuckety shit.
- You see?
Not a hesitation.
Willy, shit and fuck!
And tits.
- Dad, what's going on?
- Sorry.
Just finish your homework.
Well, that's a side of you we don't get to see all that often.
No.
No, we're not supposed to, really.
Not publicly.
- Let's get some air.
- No, I don't think that's a good idea.
What's the matter?
Why are you so upset?
Logue, you have no idea.
My... my brother is infatuated with a woman who's been married twice.
She's asking for a divorce, and he's determined to marry her.
- Jesus.
- Mrs. Wallis Simpson
- of Baltimore.
- That's not right.
- Queen Wallis of Baltimore.
- Unthinkable.
- Can he do it?
- Absolutely not.
But he's going to anyway.
All hell's broken loose.
- Can't they just carry on privately?
- If only they would.
Where does this leave you?
I know my place.
I...
I...
I will do anything in my power to keep my brother on the throne.
Is it that serious?
- Your place may well be on the throne.
- I am not an alternative to my brother.
- You can outshine David.
- Don't take liberties!
- That's bordering on treason.
- I'm just saying you could be King.
- You could do it.
- That is treason.
I'm trying to get you to realize you needn't be governed by fear.
I've had enough of this.
- What are you so afraid of?
- Your poisonous words!
Why did you come to me?
You're not some middle-class banker who wants elocution lessons so you can chitchat...
Don't attempt to instruct me on my duties!
I am the son of a...
King.
And the brother of... of a King.
You're the disappointing son of a brewer.
A jumped-up jackeroo from the outback.
You're a nobody.
These sessions are over.
Through here, sir.
It's not because she's an American.
That is the least of it.
It's because she's a soon to be twice divorced American.
And the King, as head of the Church of England, cannot marry a divorced woman.
And, sir, I apologize for the nature of this.
According to Scotland Yard, the King has not always possessed exclusive rights to Mrs. Simpson's...
favors and affections sharing them with a married used car salesman, a certain Mr. Guy Trundle.
In addition, it is also rumored Hitler's ambassador,
Count von Ribbentrop, sends her 17 carnations every day.
Should His Majesty continue to ignore the advice of his government, he must abdicate.
Otherwise, his government has no choice but to resign.
Prime Minister, you'd leave a country without a a government?
Does the King do what he wants?
Or does he do what the people expect him to do?
As crowds in Downing Street watch ministers come and go, can a king separate his personal life
- from his public duty...
- What's the matter, love?
I'm just having trouble with a patient.
That isn't like you.
- Why?
- He's scared.
He's afraid of his own shadow.
Isn't that why they come to you?
This fellow could really be somebody great.
He's fighting me.
Perhaps he doesn't want to be great.
Perhaps that's what you want.
I might have overstepped the mark.
Apologize.
Do you both good.
I'm very sorry, Mr. Logue, the Duke is busy.
I'm happy to wait.
Or I could come back later.
As I said, the Duke is terribly busy.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Parliament will not support the marriage.
But there are other reasons for concern.
He was careless with state papers.
He lacked commitment and resolve, and there are those who are worried about where he will stand when war comes with Germany.
- We're not coming to that?
- Indeed we are, sir.
Prime Minister Baldwin may deny this, but Hitler's intent is crystal clear.
War with Germany will come.
And we will need a King whom we can all stand behind, united.
I fear my brother is not of sound mind at this time.
Have you thought what you will call yourself?
Hmm?
Certainly not Albert, sir.
Too Germanic.
What about George?
After your father?
George the Sixth has a rather nice continuity to it.
Don't you think?
David.
Thank God.
You look exhausted.
How are you bearing up?
Bertie, the decision's been made.
I...
I'm going.
- I can't accept that...
- I'm afraid there's no other way.
I must marry her.
My mind's made up.
I'm... sorry.
That's a terrible thing to hear.
Nobody wants that.
I, least of all.
At long last,
I am able to say a few words of my own.
I have never wanted to withhold anything, but until now it has not been constitutionally possible for me to speak.
A few hours ago, I discharged my last duty as King and Emperor, and now that I have been succeeded by my brothel;
the Duke of York, my first words must be to declare my allegiance to him.
This I do with all my heart.
You all know the reasons which have impelled me to renounce the throne, but you must believe me when I tell you that I have found it impossible to carry the heavy burden of responsibility and to discharge my duties as King,
as I would wish to do without the help and support of the woman I love.
And I want you to know, this decision has been made less difficult to me by the sure knowledge that my brother, with his long training in the public affairs of this country, and with his fine qualities,
will be able to take my place forthwith without interruption or injury to the life and progress of the Empire.
I meet you today in in circumstances which are...
- I'm sure you'll love it.
- There you go.
Thank you, darling.
Saddles.
Margaret.
- There's Montezuma.
- Oh, here's one.
- Mama, here's a horse and saddle.
- Thank you.
Oops.
- Don't worry, Sally.
We'll get you...
- Mama?
- Yes?
- Will we have space for our horses
- in our new home?
- Course we will, darling.
We'll have a palace of rooms.
Curtsey.
Your Majesty.
How was it?
I was trying to...
familiarize myself with... what a state paper looks like.
It's a dispatch from Mr. Baldwin, which I don't understand a word of.
David's finances.
Christmas... broadcast.
- Think that would be a mistake.
- No, don't worry about that.
Oh.
Plans for the Coronation.
Think that would be an even bigger mistake.
- I'm not a King.
- Oh, shush.
I'm a Naval officer.
That's all I know.
I'm not a King.
I'm not a King.
- I'm sorry.
- No.
- I'm sorry.
- No, don't be silly.
Please.
Oh, my dear.
My dear, dear man.
- I'm sorry.
- You know,
I refused your first two marriage proposals, not because I didn't love you, but because I couldn't bear the idea of a Royal life.
Couldn't bear the idea of a life of tours, public duty, of...
Well, a life that no longer was really to be my own.
But then I thought, he stammers so beautifully, they'll leave us alone.
Waiting for a King to apologize, one can wait rather a long wait.
I'm afraid we're slightly late.
This is home.
Myrtle's at bridge.
I made sure the boys were out.
It's lovely.
Absolutely lovely.
- Oh!
May I sit down?
- Yes, of course.
- Would you like some tea, ma'am?
- Yes, I'll help myself.
Now, off you go.
Or must I knock your heads together?
Here's your shilling.
I understand what you were trying to say, Logue.
I went about it the wrong way.
I'm sorry.
So, here I am.
Is the nation ready for two...
minutes of radio silence?
Every stammerer always fears going back to square one.
I don't let that happen.
If I fail in my duty,
David could come back.
I've seen the placards.
"God save our...
King."
They don't mean me.
Every monarch in history has succeeded someone who's dead or just about to be.
My predecessor is not only alive, but very much so.
It's a bloody mess.
Couldn't even give them a Christmas speech.
- Like your dad used to do?
- Precisely.
He's not here anymore.
Yes, he is.
He's on that shilling I gave you.
Easy enough to give away.
You don't have to carry him around in your pocket.
Or your brother.
You don't need to be afraid of the things you were afraid of when you were five.
You're very much your own man, Bertie.
Am I?
- Your face is next, mate.
- Lionel, dear!
Myrtle.
- Is this your wife?
- Yes.
Bertie.
Come here.
- Are you all right, Logue?
- Yes.
- Shouldn't we go through?
- Trust me, it's important.
- What is it?
- Oh!
- You're...
- It's "Your Majesty" the first time.
After that, it's "Ma'am." As in "ham."
Not "malm" as in "palm."
I haven't told her about us.
Sit down, relax.
I'm told your husband calls my husband Bertie.
And my husband calls your husband Lionel.
I trust you won't call me Liz.
Your Majesty, you may call me Mrs. Logue, ma'am.
Very nice to meet you, Mrs. Logue.
- Logue, we can't stay here all day.
- Yes, we can.
- Logue!
- I need to wait for the right moment.
- Logue, you're being a coward.
- You're damn right.
Get out there, man.
Hello, Myrtle, darling.
You're early.
I believe you two have met, but I don't think you know...
- ...
King George the Sixth.
- It's very nice to meet you.
Will Their Majesties be staying to dinner?
We'd love to, such a treat, but alas a previous engagement.
What a pity.
- Archbishop.
- Welcome, Your Majesty.
What a glorious transformation, sir.
I hope you'll forgive us if we continue our preparations?
Now, allow me to guide you through the ceremony.
We begin, of course, at the West door into the nave.
I see all your pronouncements are to be broadcast, Archbishop.
Ah, yes.
Wireless.
It is, indeed, a Pandora's box, and I'm afraid I've also had to permit the newsreel cameras.
The product of which I shall personally edit.
Without momentary hesitations.
This is Dr. Logue of Harley Street.
He's... my speech therapist.
- Your Grace.
- Had I known that Your Majesty was seeking assistance, I should have made my own recommendation.
Dr. Logue will will be attending the Coronation.
Of course I'll speak to the Dean, but it will be extremely difficult.
I should like the doctor to be seated in the King's Box.
But members of your family will be seated there, sir.
That is why it is suitable.
And now, if you don't mind, Your Grace, we need the premises.
My dear fellow, this is Westminster Abbey.
The Church must prepare His Majesty.
My preparations are equally as important.
With complete privacy, if you don't mind.
Those are my wishes, Your Grace.
I will place the Abbey at Your Majesty's disposal, this evening.
Your Majesty.
I can't believe I'm walking on Chaucer and Handel and Dickens.
Everything all right?
Let's get cracking.
I'm not here to rehearse, Dr. Logue.
Call me Lionel.
True, you... never called yourself Doctor.
I did that for you.
No training.
No diploma, no qualifications
Just... a great deal of nerve.
The Star Chamber inquisition, is it?
You asked for trust.
And... total equality.
Bertie, I heard you at Wembley.
I was there.
My son Laurie said, "Dad, do you think you could help that poor man?"
- What, as a failed actor?
- it's true.
I'm not a doctor.
And yes, I acted, a bit.
Well, I recited in pubs.
I taught elocution in schools.
When the Great War came, all our soldiers were returning to Australia from the front, a lot of them shell-shocked, unable to speak.
Somebody said, Lionel, "You're very good at this speech stuff.
Do you think you could possibly help these poor buggers?"
I did muscle therapy, exercises, relaxation, but I knew I had to go deeper.
Those poor young blokes had cried out in fear.
No one was listening to them.
My job was to give them faith in their own voice, and let them know that a friend was listening.
That must ring a few bells with you, Bertie.
You give a very noble account of yourself.
- Make inquiries.
It's all true.
- Inquiries have been made.
You have no idea who I have breathing down my neck.
I vouched for you, and you have no...
- ...credentials.
- But lots of success.
I can't show you a certificate.
There was no training then.
Everything I know, I know from experience.
And that war was some experience.
My plaque says, "L. Logue, Speech Defects."
Not "Doctor." There are no letters after my name.
- Lock me in the Tower.
- I would if I could.
- On what charge?
- Fraud.
With war looming, you've saddled this nation with a voiceless King.
You've destroyed the happiness of my family, all for the sake of ensnaring a star... patient you couldn't possibly hope to assist.
It'll be like mad King George the Third.
I'll be...
Mad King George the Stammerer who let his people down so badly in their hour of need.
What are you doing?
Get up!
You can't sit there!
Get up!
- Why not?
it's a chair.
- No, it...
That is not a chair!
That is...
That...
- That is Saint Edward's chair.
- People have carved their names on it.
That chair is the seat on which every King...
- It's held in place by a large rock.
- That is the Stone of Scone!
- You are trivializing everything.
- I don't care how many royal assholes
- have sat on this chair.
- Listen to me!
Listen to me!
- Listen to you?
By what right?
- By Divine Right, if you must.
- I am your King!
- No, you're not.
You told me so yourself.
You said you didn't want it.
Why should I waste my time listening to you?
Because I have a right to be heard!
I have a voice!
Yes, you do.
You have such perseverance, Bertie.
You're the bravest man I know.
You'll make a bloody good King.
- What on earth is going on, sir?
- It's quite all right, Archbishop.
Mr. Logue, you must know that
I've found a replacement English specialist with impeccable credentials.
Hence, your services will no longer be required.
- I'm sorry?
- Your Majesty's function is to consult and be advised.
Now, you didn't consult,
- but you have just been advised.
- And now I advise you.
In this personal matter, I will make my own decision.
My concern is for the head on which I must place the crown.
I appreciate that, Archbishop.
But it's my head.
Your humble servant.
Thank you, Bertie.
Shall we rehearse?
Come on.
Up on your perch.
Now, when you and Elizabeth enter through the West door, you will be greeted by the hymn "I was glad when they said unto me."
Actually, you won't be that glad because they do sing it for a very long time.
Then your friend, the Archbishop, will ponce up the stairs towards you, and say, "Sir, is Your Majesty willing to take the oath?"
- "l am willing."
- Well, of course you are.
I'm gonna see what this sounds like in the cheap seats, so even your old nanny can hear.
"Will you govern your peoples, Great Britain, Ireland, Canada,
Australia and New Zealand, according to their lands and customs?"
- "l solemnly promise to do so."
- Louder.
- I can't hear you up the back.
- "I solemnly promise to do so."
Very good. "And will you, to your power, cause Law and Justice, in Mercy to be executed in all your judgments?"
"I will.
I will!"
Then there's a very long bit about upholding the faith.
It goes on, rubbish, rubbish, rubbish, to which you finally say...
"The things which I have...
here before promised,
I will perform and keep.
So help me God."
And that's all you say.
Four short responses.
Kiss the book, sign the oath, and you're King.
Easy.
You nearly crowned him backwards, Archbishop.
Someone had removed the thread marking the back of the crown, sir.
Try not to lose the thread, Archbishop.
Archbishop, we're missing Papa.
- God save the King.
- Very good.
Very good, Archbishop.
Well, I hope Your Majesties are thrilled with the result.
- You can switch that machine off.
- No, wait.
Keep going.
- Nazism has held its great convention.
- Do take a seat, Archbishop.
Masses of uniformed men, stupefying to the eye, and incredible to the imagination have stood in spellbound audience of the Fuhrer.
- Papa?
Papa, what's he saying?
- Hmm?
I don't know, but he seems to be saying it rather well.
Sir...
I have asked to see you today in order to tender my resignation as Prime Minister.
I'm so sorry to hear that, Mr. Baldwin.
Neville Chamberlain will take my place as Prime Minister.
It's a matter of principle.
I was mistaken.
I have found it impossible to believe that there is any man in the world so lacking in moral feeling as Hitler, that the world may be hurled for a second time into the abyss of destructive war.
Churchill was right all along.
This was always Hitler's intention.
I'm only very sorry to leave you at this great time of crisis.
I'm very much afraid, sir, that your greatest test is yet to come.
I am speaking to you from the Cabinet room at 10 Downing Street.
This morning, the British ambassador in Berlin handed the German government a final note stating that unless we heard from them by 11:00, that they were prepared at once to withdraw their troops from Poland, a state of war would exist between us.
I have to tell you now that no such undertaking has been received, and that, consequently, this country is at war with Germany.
At last, sir, here is your speech.
You are on air at six.
I have timed it to just under nine minutes.
The wording is fully approved.
The Prime Minister will be joining you for the broadcast, which will go outlive across the nation, the Empire
- and to our armed forces.
- Get Logue here immediately.
- There's the barrage balloons.
- Yes.
- They got them up there quickly.
- Yeah.
- Shall we pull over and find a shelter?
- No, no.
Go straight there.
We'll be all right.
- Yes, sir?
- Lionel Logue.
Major Hartley is expecting me.
This is my son, Laurie.
- Thank you, Laurie.
- Good luck, Dad.
- The King's speech.
- Thank you, sir.
We have about 40 minutes to the broadcast.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
There may be dark days ahead...
- ...and...
- Try again.
There may be dark days ahead, and...
Turn the hesitations into pauses and say to yourself, "God save the King."
I say that continuously, but apparently no one's listening.
Long pauses are good.
They add solemnity to great occasions.
Then I'm the solemnest king who ever lived.
You know, if I'm a king, where's my power?
Can I... can I form a government?
Can I... can I...
levy a tax?
Declare a... a war?
No.
And yet I'm the seat of all authority.
Why?
Because the nation believes that when I...
I speak,
I speak for them.
But I can't speak.
Let's take it all again from the top.
"In this grave hour."
In this grave hour...
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

A great moment, sir.
- Prime Minister.
- Your Majesty.
Nice to see you... again so soon.
Good of you to be here.
I'm sure you have a...
- ...a rather busy day.
- I hope we have no more interruptions

- Or the wretched dogs.
Congrat...
Congratulations.
- First Lord of the Admiralty.
- Your Majesty.
The long... walk.
Good luck, sir.
I, too, dread this apparatus.
Had a speech impediment myself, you know.
- I didn't.
- Family secret.
Tongue-tied.
An operation was considered to be too dangerous.
I eventually made an asset of it.
- Thank you, Mr. Churchill.
- Sir.
Darling.
- How long, Logue?
- Just under three minutes.
- Mr. Wood.
- Good luck, Your Majesty.
Mr. Wood.
- You've redecorated, Logue.
- I made it cozy.
- Some fresh air.
- There you are, darling.
I'm a thistle-sifter.
I've a sieve of sifted thistles and a sieve of unsifted thistles.
A sieve of sifted thistles and a sieve of unsifted thistles.
- Because I'm...
- Bertie.
Darling.
Make sure it's not switched on.
Remember, the red light will blink four times, then I've asked them to turn it off.
'Cause we don't want that evil eye staring at you all the way through.
One minute, sir.
I'm sure you'll be splendid.
Forty seconds, sir.
Logue.
However this turns out I don't know how to thank you...
for what you've done.
Knighthood?
Twenty seconds.
Forget everything else, and just say it to me.
Say it to me as a friend.
In this grave... ..hour..
...perhaps the most fateful in our history I send to every household of my a-peoples both at home and overseas this message spoken with the same depth of feeling for each one of you as if I were able to cross your threshold
and speak to you... myself.
For the second time in the lives of most of us we are... at...
Fuck, fuck, fuck!
...at war.
Very good.
Over and over again we have tried to find a peaceful way out of the differences between ourselves and those who are now our... enemies.
But it has been... in vain.
We have been forced into a conflict, for we are called to meet the challenge of a principle, which, if it were to prevail, would be fatal to any civilized order in the world.
Such a principle, stripped of all disguise, is surely the mere primitive doctrine that might is right.
For the sake of all that we ourselves hold dean it is unthinkable that we should refuse to meet the challenge.
It is to this high purpose that I now call my people at home, and my peoples across the seas, who will make our cause their own.
I ask them to stand calm and firm and united in this time of trial.
The task will be hard.
There may be dark days ahead, and war can no longer be confined to the battlefield.
But we can only do the right as we see the right, and reverently commit our cause to God.
If one and all we keep resolutely faithful to it, then, with God's help, we shall... prevail.
It was very good, Bertie.
You still stammered on the
Well, I had to throw in a few, so they knew it was me.
Congratulations, Your Majesty.
A true broadcaster.
Thank you, Mr. Wood.
- Congratulations, Your Majesty.
- Sir.
- Congratulations, Your Majesty.
- Thank you.
Ready.
- Good?
- Perfect, sir.
Your first wartime speech.
Congratulations.
I expect I shall have to...
do a great deal more.
Thank you, Logue.
Well done.
My friend.
Thank you Your Majesty.
I knew you'd be good.
Thank you...
Lionel.
Onwards.
- Congratulations, sir.
- Well done, sir.
Couldn't have said it better myself, sir.
Your Majesty, I am speechless.
- Congratulations, sir.
- Gentlemen.
- So how was Papa, Elizabeth?
- Halting at first,
- but you got much better, Papa.
- Well, bless you.
- And how about you, Margaret?
- You were just splendid, Papa.
Of course I was.
Are we all ready?
Come on, girls.
You're live in two minutes, Your Royal Highness.
Sir?
Thank you.
Let the microphone do the work, sir.
I'm sure you'll be splendid.
Just take your time.
Time to go.
Good afternoon.
"This is the BBC National Program and Empire Service taking you to Wembley Stadium for the closing ceremony Of the Empire Exhibition.
...Where His Royal Highness, the Duke of York, will read a message from his father;
His Majesty King George V."
"Fifty eight British colonies and dominions have taken part,... making this the largest exhibition staged anywhere in the world."
Remember, sir, three flashes, then steady red means you're live.
"Using the new invention of radio, the opening ceremony was the first time His Majesty the King addressed his subjects on the wireless."
"At the close of the first season, ...the heir to the throne, His Royal Highness, the Prince of Wales, made his first broadcast, and today, his younger brother, His Royal Highness, the Duke of York, will give his inaugural broadcast to the nation and the world."
I have received from His Majesty the the the King...
Inhale deep into your lungs, Your Royal Highness.
Relaxes your larynx, does it not?
Cigarette smoking calms the nerves, and gives you confidence.
Now, if Your Royal Highness would be so kind as to open your hand.
It's Sterilized.
Now..
One, two, three, four, five, six seven.
Now, if I may take the liberty, insert them into your mouth?
Excuse me, Doctor.
What is the purpose of this?
It's the classic approach.
It cured Demosthenes.
That was in Ancient Greece...uh Has it worked since?
Now, if you would be so kind as to read.
"A wealth of words."
Fight against those marbles, Your Royal Highness.
Enunciate.
A little more concentration, Your Royal Highness.
I nearly swallowed the bloody things!
Thank you so much, Doctor.
It's been most, um...
- ...interesting.
- Your Royal Highness.
Insert marbles.
He can insert his own bloody marbles.
Tick, tock.
Tick, tock.
You know you can't keep doing this, Bertie.
- I know.
- Mmm.
Promise me...
Promise me no more.
Ah!
Hello?
- Is anyone there?
- I'm just in the loo.
Ah, Mrs. Johnson, there you are.
I'm sorry, I don't have a receptionist.
I like to keep things simple.
"Poor and content is rich and rich enough."
- I'm sorry?
- Shakespeare.
How are you?
- How do you do?
- Oh, chuffing along.
Um, now, this is slightly awkward, but I'm afraid you're late.
- Yes.
I'm afraid I am.
- Where's Mr. Johnson?
Ah...
He doesn't know I'm here.
Well, that's not a very promising start.
No.
No, look, my husband has seen everyone To no avail.
I'm awfully afraid he's given up hope.
- He hasn't seen me.
- You're awfully sure of yourself.
Well, I'm sure of anyone who wants to be cured.
Of course he wants to be cured.
My husband is, um...
- Well, he's required to speak publicly.
- Perhaps he should change jobs?
- He can't.
- Indentured servitude?
Something of that nature, yes.
Well, we need to have your hubby pop by.
Uh...
Tuesday would be good.
He can give me his personal details, I'll make a frank appraisal...
- ...and then we'll take it from there.
- Doctor, forgive me.
Uh, I don't have a "hubby." We don't "pop."
And nor do we ever talk about our private lives.
No, you must come to us.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Johnson, my game, my turf, my rules.
Mmm.
You'll have to talk this over with your husband, and then you can speak to me on the telephone.
Thank you very much for dropping by...
Good afternoon.
And what if my husband were the Duke of York?
- The Duke of York?
- Yes...
The Duke of York.
I thought the appointment was for Johnson.
Forgive me, Your...
- Royal Highness.
- ...
Royal Highness.
Yes, Johnson was used during the Great War, when the Navy didn't want the enemy
- ...to know he was aboard.
- Am I...considered the enemy?
You will be, if you remain un-obliging.
You'll appreciate the need for absolute discretion.
Of course.
How did you find me, Your Royal Highness?
The President of The Society For Speech Therapists.
Eileen McCleod?
She's a sport.
Dr McCleod warned me your antipodean methods were both "unorthodox" and "controversial."
I warned her those are not my favorite words.
I can cure your husband.
But for my method to work, I need trust and total equality, here in the safety of my consultation room.
No exceptions.
Oh, well then...
In that case...
When can you start?
- She's still sounding a bit rough, mate.
- You make me drive too slowly, Dad!
- Did you pick Mum up from bridge?
- Yeah, I've hardly been out of the car.
I had a special visitor this afternoon.
- May I please leave the table?
- How special's special?
No, you must stay, bored stupid, listening to your parents' inane conversation.
- Thanks, Dad...
- And Mum.
- And Mum.
- Me, too.
- You meeting Jean?
- No.
Someone else.
- Doctor?
Doctor?
- Hmm?
Go and help your brother with the washing up.
- I'm fine.
- Who is it, Lionel?
Why bring it up if you can't talk about it?
Myrtle, it's just a woman looking to help her husband.
Oh, and I had a call... for an audition.
- One of my favorites.
- Aren't they all?
It Could be a lot of fun.
I'm sure you'll be splendid.
In the amateur scene, they're a highly regarded group.
From Putney.
No, that's all girls.
Tomorrow, chapter four, "The Flight."
Mama, I long to know where they fly to.
- I can't wait!
- Oh, to fly away.
Weren't they lucky?
Now Papa, tell a story.
Can't I be a penguin instead?
Well, no, I want a penguin story.
Very quickly.
Once there were...
two princesses.
Princess Elizabeth and Princess Margaret, whose papa was a penguin.
This was because he'd been turned into one by a wicked witch.
This was very inconvenient for him because he loved to hold his princesses in his arms.
But you can't if you're a penguin because you...
- ...you have wings like herrings.
- Herrings don't have wings.
Penguins have wings which are...
are shaped like herrings.
And what made matters worse is that she... she sent him to the South Pole, which is an awfully long walk back if if you can't fly.
So when he reached the water, he he dived in, through the depths, so fast that he was in Southampton Waters by lunchtime.
And from there, he took the 2:30 to Weybridge, changed at Clapham Junction, asked a a passing mallard the way to Buckingham Palace, swam up The Thames, out through the plughole and gave the cook, Mama and Mrs. Whittaker quite a shock.
Now, when the girls heard all the commotion, they ran to the kitchen, where they gave him a a good scrub, a mackerel and a kiss.
And as they kissed him guess what he turned into?
- A handsome prince.
- A short-tailed albatross.
- Oh.
- With wings so big, that he could wrap them both around his two girls together.
Now, girls.
Time for bed.
Come on.
- And take those horses to the stable.
- Quickly, now.
- You have exactly a minute.
- Good night.
Feed them, brush them and to bed.
- Will Mrs. Simpson be there?
- My brother's insisting.
- Is he serious?
- About her coming to dinner?
No.
About her.
- A married woman?
He can't be.
- She can.
By the way, I think I've found someone rather interesting.
On Harley Street.
A doctor.
Out of the question.
I'm not having this conversation again.
Mat...
Matter's settled.
Mmm.
His approach seems rather different.
Now?
Now.
Now is the winter of our discontent, made glorious summer by this sun of York.
And all the clouds that lour'd upon our house
In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.
Now are our brows bound with... victorious... wreaths;
Thank you.
- Lovely diction, Mr...?
- Logue.
Lionel Logue.
Well, Mr. Logue,
I'm not hearing the cries of a deformed creature yearning to be king.
Nor did I realize Richard III was King of the Colonies.
I do know all the lines.
I've played the role before.
- Sydney?
- Perth.
Major theater town, is it?
- Enthusiastic.
- Ah.
I was well reviewed.
Yes.
Well, Lionel, I think our dramatic society is looking for someone slightly younger.
And a...
little more regal.
- There you are.
- Thank you.
- Oh.
- Mmm.
No, you have to shut that one first.
Close that one first.
That's it.
Where did you find this... physician?
Classifieds.
Next to a "French model, Shepherd's Market."
No, he comes highly recommended.
Charges substantial fees to help the poor.
Oh, dear.
Perhaps he's a Bolshevik.
Ah, there's no receptionist.
Likes to keep things simple.
Uh...
The Johnsons.
You can go in now, Mr. Johnson.
Lionel says wait here if you wish, Mrs. Johnson.
Or, it being a pleasant day...
P...perhaps take a stroll.
Was that all right, Lionel?
Marvelous, Willie.
You can stay here and wait for your mum.
Mrs. Johnson.
Mr. Johnson.
Do come in.
Would you like a sweetie?
He's a good lad, Willie.
He could hardly make a sound, you know, when he first came to me.
My boys make those.
They're good, aren't they?
Please, make yourself comfortable.
I was told not to sit too close.
Well I believe when speaking with a prince,
One waits for the prince to choose the topic.
Waiting for me to...
Ah, yes, well...
Do you know any jokes?
- Timing isn't my strong suit.
- Cup of tea?
- No.
No, thank you.
- I think I'll have one.
Aren't you going to start treating me, Dr. Logue?
Only if you're interested in being treated.
Please, call me Lionel.
No, I... prefer Doctor.
I prefer Lionel.
- What will I call you?
- Your Royal Highness.
Then... it's "sir" after that.
It's a little bit formal for here.
I prefer names.
Prince Albert Frederick Arthur George?
How about Bertie?
- Only my family uses that.
- Perfect.
In here, it's better if we're equals.
If... if we were equals, I wouldn't be here.
I'd be... at home with my wife, and no one would give a damn.
Please, don't do that.
I'm sorry?
I believe sucking smoke into your lungs, well, it will kill you.
My physicians say it relaxes the...
- ...the throat.
- They're idiots.
- They've all been knighted.
- Makes it official, then.
My castle, my rules.
Thank you.
What was your earliest memory?
- What on earth do you mean?
- Your first recollection.
I'm not here to discuss personal matters.
- Well, why are you here, then?
- Because I bloody well stammer!
- You have a bit of a temper.
- One of my many faults.
- When did the defect start?
- I've always been this way.
- I doubt that.
- Don't...
- ...tell me, it's my stammer.
- It's my field.
I can assure you, no infant starts to speak with a stammer.
When did yours start?
- Four or five.
- That's typical.
So I've been told.
I...
I can't remember not doing it.
I can believe that.
Do you hesitate when you think?
- Don't be ridiculous.
- How about when you talk to yourself?
Everyone natters to themselves occasionally, Bertie.
Stop...
Stop calling me that.
I'm not going to call you anything else.
Then we shan't speak.
Are you charging for this, Doctor?
A fortune.
I'll just let that brew.
So... when you talk to yourself, do you stammer?
No... of course not.
Well, that proves that your impediment isn't a permanent part of you.
What do you think was the cause?
I don't... don't know.
I...
I don't...
I don't care.
I...
I stammer.
No one can fix it.
I'll bet you that you can read flawlessly, right here, right now.
And if I win the bet, I get to ask you more questions.
- And if I win?
- You don't have to answer them.
One usually... wagers money.
A bob each to keep it sweet?
- Let's see your shilling.
- I don't... carry money.
I had a funny feeling you mightn't.
I'll stake you, and you can pay me back next time.
- If there is a next time.
- I haven't agreed to take you on yet.
So please stand, uh, and take a look at that.
From there.
I...
I can't read this.
Well, then you owe me a shilling for not trying.
To be or not to be, that...
- Can't read it.
- Uh-uh-uh!
I haven't finished yet.
I'm going to record your voice and then play it back to you on the same machine.
This is brilliant.
It's the latest thing from America.
It's a Silvertone.
Pop these on.
There's a bob in this, mate.
You could go home rich.
- You're playing music!
- I know.
So how can I hear what I'm saying?
Well, surely a prince's brain knows what its mouth's doing?
You're not... well acquainted with royal princes, are you?
Hopeless.
Hopeless!
You were sublime.
Would I lie to a prince of the realm to win 12 pennies?
I've no idea what an Australian might do for that sort of money.
Let me play it back to you.
No.
All right, then, well, I get to ask you the questions.
Thank you, Doctor.
I don't feel this is for me.
Thank you for your time.
Goodbye.
Sir?
The recording is free.
Please keep it as a souvenir.
No.
Oh, well.
Bugger.
For the present, the work to which we are all equally bound, is to arrive at a reasoned tranquility within our borders, ...to regain prosperity at this time of depression without self-seeking, and to carry with us
those whom the burden of the past years has disheartened or overborne.
To all, to each, I wish a happy Christmas.
God bless you.
And off air.
Easy when you know how.
Sir?
Have a go yourself.
- Congratulations, sir.
- Ah, Mr. Wood.
Splendid fellow.
Chap who taught me everything I know.
- Let the microphone do the work.
- Sir.
- Thank you.
- Gentlemen.
Sit up.
Straight back.
Face boldly up to the bloody thing and stare it square in the eye, as would any decent Englishman.
Show who's in command.
Papa, I d...don't... thu...thu...
think I c... c... can read this.
This devilish device will change everything if you don't.
In the past, all a king had to do was look respectable in uniform and not fall off his horse.
Now, we must invade people's homes and ingratiate ourselves with them.
This family's been reduced to those lowest, basest of all creatures.
We've become actors.
We're not a family, we're a firm.
Yet at any moment, some of us may be out of work.
Your darling brother and future king, the only wife he appears interested in is invariably the wife of another.
- He's broken off with Lady Furness.
- And taken up with Mrs. Simpson.
A woman with two husbands living.
I told him straight.
No divorced person can ever be received at court.
He said it made him sublimely happy.
I imagine that was because she was sleeping with him.
"I give you my word," this is what he said.
"I give you my word, we've never had immoral relations."
Stared square into his father's face and lied.
When I'm dead, that boy will ruin himself, this family and this nation within 12 months.
Who will pick up the pieces, hmm?
Herr Hitler intimidating half of Europe.
Marshal Stalin the other half.
Who will stand between us, the jackboots and the proletarian abyss?
You?
Well?
With your older brother shirking his duties, you're going to have to do a lot more of this.
Have a go yourself.
Through the wireless...
- Get it out, boy.
...one of the m... marvels of m...
"Modern." Just take your time.
Form your words carefully.
...science I am enabled, this ...
Relax.
Just try it!
...this Christmas Day to speak to all my...
Do it!
Lying... bastard.
- You're playing music.
- I know.
So how can I...
hear what I'm saying?
Well, surely a prince's brain knows what its mouth's doing.
You're not... well acquainted with royal princes, are you?
"To be or not be, that is the question.
Whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, or to take arms against a sea of troubles, and by opposing end them?
To die, to sleep no more, and by a sleep to say the end is the heartache and the thousand natural shocks the flesh is heir to.
Tis a consummation hopeless."
Hopeless!
Strictly business.
No...
- ...personal nonsense.
- Yes, I thought I'd made that clear...
- ...in our interview.
- Have you got the shilling you owe me?
- No, I haven't.
- Didn't think so.
Besides, you... you tricked me.
Physical exercises and tricks are important, but what you're asking will only deal with the surface of the problem.
Is that sufficient?
Uh, no.
As far as I see it, my husband has mechanical difficulties with his speech.
- I...
- Maybe just deal with that.
I...
- I'm willing to work hard, Dr. Logue.
- Lionel.
Are you...
Are you willing to do your part?
All right.
You want mechanics?
We need to relax your jaw muscles, strengthen your tongue, by repeating tongue twisters.
For example, "I'm a thistle-sifter.
I have a sieve of sifted thistles and a sieve of unsifted thistles.
- Because I am a thistle-sifter."
- Fine.
And you do have a flabby tummy, so we'll need to spend some time strengthening your diaphragm.
Simple mechanics.
- That's all we ask.
- All that's about a shilling's worth.
Forget about the blessed shilling!
Perhaps, upon occasions you might be requested to assist in coping with with some minor event.
Would that be agreeable?
Of course.
Yes, and that would be the full extent of your services.
- Shall I see you next week?
- I shall see you every day.
Ahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahah.
Feel the looseness of the jaw.
Good.
Little bounces.
Bounces.
Shoulders loose, shoulders loose.
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful.
Now, loose.
Take a nice deep breath.
Expand the chest.
Put your hands onto your ribs.
Deeper.
Good.
- How do you feel?
- Full of hot air.
Isn't that what public speaking's all about?
My wife and I are glad to visit this important...
Take a good deep breath, and up comes Your Royal Highness.
And slowly exhale, and down comes Your Royal Highness.
- You all right, Bertie?
- Yes.
It's actually quite good fun.
Mmm...
Mother.
Shorten the humming each time.
Mother.
Mmm manufacturing district...
- Another deep breath.
- And Jack and Jill.
- Jack and Jill.
- Went up the hill.
- Went up the hill.
Now, just sway.
Perfect.
...will not permit us to...
- Loosen the shoulders.
Ding dong bell, pussy's in the well.
Who put her in?
Little Tommy Tin.
You have a short memory, Bertie.
Come on.
- A cow, a cow...
- A king.
A... a king...
Anyone who can shout vowels at an open window can learn to deliver a speech.
- Fourteen, 15!
- Good.
Deep breath, and...
It is...
- Let the words flow.
- No, it doesn't bloody work.
Come on, one more time, Bertie.
You can do it.
A sieve of thisted siphles.
Gah!
Mah!
Bah!
Father.
- Father.
- Father.
- Aim for the a-t-h.
- Father.
- Father.
- Father.
Father.
Father.
- Hello, Bertie.
- Hello, David.
- Nice of you to come out.
- Not at all.
You been waiting long?
Christ, bloody freezing.
Where have you been?
- I've been busy.
- So have I.
- Elizabeth has pneumonia.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- She'll recover.
- Father won't.
I'll drive.
Old bugger's doing this on purpose.
- Dying?
- Departing prematurely.
To...
To complicate matters with Wallis.
For heaven's sake, David.
You know how long he's been ill.
Wallis explained.
She's terribly clever about these things.
Whereas my letters patent under the Great Seal bearing date of Westminster the 11th day of June 1912,
His Majesty King George the Fifth did constitute order and declare that there should be a Guardian...
- What's going on here?
- ...custos regne...
I cannot follow you.
I'm confused and I don't understand...
It's the Order of the Council of State, sir.
So that we may act on your behalf much clearer to me, I'm afraid...
- Well, I'm so confused that...
- Approved.
Thank you.
- Let me help you, sir.
- Ah, yes...
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.
- Feeling a little better, sir?
- No, I'm not feeling any better.
I feel dreadful.
Ah...
Been, uh, ice skating?
Ice skating?
No.
No, George.
Yes.
Yes, all right, of course.
I know, darling.
A talk, even a lovely long talk is a poor substitute for holding tight and making drowsy.
Nor making our own drowsies either, as we've had to do too often lately.
- David.
Dinner.
- I'm on with Wallis.
It's Bertie.
No.
No, it's not important.
I don't want to.
No.
Telephone me later?
All right, goodbye.
- Wallis misses me terribly.
- Mama says you're late for dinner.
She forgets Papa's bloody clocks are all half an hour fast.
How's the King?
I...
I hope he's not in pain.
No, no, sir.
His Majesty's quieter now.
Thank you.
David, if your father were here, tardiness would not be tolerated.
None of this unpleasantness would be tolerated.
You know, sir, I appreciate that you are different from your father, both in outlook and... temperament.
I want you to know that whenever the King questioned your conduct,
I tried, in your interest, to present it in the most favorable light.
Mmm.
I can always trust you to have my best interests at heart.
I fear our vigil will not be of long duration.
Please continue.
Let us commend our brother George to the mercy of God,
Our Maker and Redeemer.
Long live the King.
I hope I will make good as he has made good.
- What on earth was that?
- Poor Wallis.
Now, I'm trapped.
And in these last 25 crowded, troubled, glorious years, if there is one thing that King George has taught, it is the art of the leader who is also a brother to his followers.
As long as he lived, he was the guiding star of a great nation.
- Dad?
- Mmm-hmm?
- When he died...
- Time for a Shake, Dad?
... the little children cried in the streets.
- You sure?
- Go on.
Put your thinking caps on.
- I bet it's the Scottish play.
- No, it's Othello.
It's always Othello.
Art thou afeard?
- Be not afeard.
- Caliban.
Oh, for heaven's sake.
That was a lucky guess.
Don't listen to egghead.
Go on, Dad.
The isle is full of noises, sounds and sweet airs that give delight, and hurt not.
Sometimes a thousand twangling instruments will hum about mine ears, and sometimes voices, that, if then I had waked after long sleep, will make me sleep again.
All right, clever clogs, so what comes next?
And then, in dreaming, methought the clouds would...
- The clouds methought.
- The clouds methought would open, and show riches ready to drop upon me, that when I waked, I cried to dream again.
That's such a sad thought.
My next patient must be a bit early.
You better go, lads, I'm sorry.
Won't be a moment, Clifford.
Bertie?
They told me not to expect you.
I'm sorry about your father.
- I don't wish to intrude.
- Not at all.
Please, come in.
Come in.
I've been practicing.
An hour a day.
In spite of everything.
What's going on there?
Oh, I was...
Sorry.
Mucking around with my kids.
Do you feel like working today?
- A Curtis bi-plane.
- I'll put on some hot milk.
Logue.
Logue.
I'd kill for something stronger.
I wasn't there for my father's death.
- Still makes me sad.
- I can imagine so.
- What did your father do?
- He was a brewer.
At least there was free beer.
Here's to the memory of your father.
I was informed, after the fact, that my father's...
My father's last words were "Bertie has more guts than the rest of his brothers put together."
He couldn't say that to my face.
My brother.
What about him?
Try singing it.
- I'm sorry.
- What songs do you know?
- Songs?
- Yeah, songs.
- "Swanee River."
- I love that song.
- It happens to be my favorite.
- Sing me the chorus.
No.
Certainly not.
You know...
I always wanted to build models.
But...
Father wouldn't allow it.
He... collected stamps, so we had to collect stamps.
You can finish that off if you sing.
"My brother David Dum, dum, dum, dum..."
- I'm not going to sit here warbling.
- You can with me.
- Because you're peculiar.
- I take that as a compliment.
Well...
Rules are rules.
I'm not... crooning "Swanee River".
"Camptown Races", then.
"My brother David said to me Doo-dah, doo-dah"
- Continuous sound will give you flow.
- No.
Does it feel strange now that David's on the throne?
To tell the truth, it was a relief.
Knowing I wouldn't be...
King.
But unless he produces an heir, you're next in line.
And your daughter, Elizabeth, would then succeed you.
"You're barking up the wrong tree now, Doctor, Doctor"
"Lionel"
See?
You didn't stammer.
Of course I didn't stammer, I was singing.
Well, as a little reward, you get to put some glue on these struts.
- Your boy... won't mind?
- No, not at all.
David and I were... very close.
Young bucks, you know.
Did you chase the same girls?
David was always very helpful in... arranging introductions.
We shared the expert ministrations
Of Paulette in the Palace.
Not at the same time, of course.
- Did David ever tease you?
- Oh, yes, they all did.
"Buh-buh-buh-Bertie."
Father encouraged it.
Said, "Get it out, boy!" Said it would make me stop.
He said, "I was afraid of my father and my children are...
damn well gonna be afraid of me!"
Are you naturally right-handed?
Left.
I was... punished, and now I use the right.
Yes, that's very common with stammerers.
- Any other corrections?
- Knock knees.
Metal splints were made.
Worn... worn day and night.
- Must have been painful.
- Bloody agony.
Straight legs now.
Who were you closest to in your family?
Nannies.
Not my first nanny.
She...
She loved David.
Hated me.
When we were presented to my parents for the daily viewing, she would... she'd pinch me so that I'd cry and be handed back to her immediately.
And then she would...
Sing it.
# Then she wouldn't feed me #
# Far, far away #
Took my parents...
three years to notice.
As you... as you can imagine, caused some stomach problems.
Still.
What about your brother, Johnnie?
Were you close to him?
Johnnie... sweet boy.
Had epilepsy.
And he was... different.
He died at... 13.
Hidden from view.
I'm...
I'm told it's not... catching.
Do you want a top-up?
Please.
You know Lionel, you're you're the first ordinary Englishman...
- Australian.
- ...
I've ever really spoken to.
When I'm... driven through the streets and I see the, you know, the common man staring at me, I I'm struck by how little I know of his life and how little he knows of mine.
- Thank you.
- What are friends for?
I wouldn't know.
I sifted seven thick-stalked thistles through a strong, thick sieve.
- I sifted seven thick-stalked...
- That's enough now, darling.
Listen, I have to keep doing this, it's awful.
I sifted seven...
- Oh, no.
- ...thick-stalked...
One-hundred-year-old spruces removed to improve the view?
Who does she think she is?
Nonetheless, we must try to be pleasant towards Mrs. Simpson.
- She calls me "The Fat Scottish Cook."
- You're not fat.
I'm getting plump.
Well, you seldom cook.
- I sifted seven...
- Shut up.
...thick sieves...
I sifted seven...
Three, two, one and...
Their Royal Highnesses the Duke and Duchess of York.
Oh, how lovely to see you both.
Welcome to our little country shack.
I came at the invitation of the King.
Your Majesty.
- You all right?
- Sorry we're late.
Very nice to see you...
Mrs. Simpson.
Very nice.
Hello, David.
Making some changes to the garden, I see.
Yes, I'm not quite finished yet.
Don't tell me I behaved badly, Mr. Churchill.
On the contrary, Your Royal Highness.
Etiquette decrees that royalty should be greeted by the official host, in this case, the King.
Not a commoner.
Thank you.
- What is her hold on him?
- I've no idea.
Apparently, she has certain skills acquired in an establishment in Shanghai.
David.
Just be a sec, darling.
Would you excuse me?
- David, I've been trying to see you.
- I've been terribly busy.
- Doing what?
- Kinging.
Really?
Kinging is a a precarious business these days.
Where's the Russian tsar?
- Where's cousin Wilhelm?
- You're being dreary.
Is kinging laying off 80... staff and buying more pearls for Wallis, while people are marching across Europe singing The Red Flag?
- Herr Hitler will sort them out.
- Who will sort out Herr Hitler?
Where's the bloody 23?
And you put that woman in our mother's suite!
- Mama's not still in the bed, is she?
- That's not funny.
Here it is.
Wallis likes the very best.
I don't care what woman you carry on with at night, as long as you... show up for duty in the morning.
Wallis is not just some woman I'm carrying on with.
We intend to marry.
- Excuse me?
- She's filing a petition for divorce.
Good God.
Can't you just give her a nice house and a title?
- I'm not having her as my mistress.
- The Church doesn't recognize divorce,
- and you are the... head of the Church.
- Haven't I any rights?
- Many privileges.
- Not the same thing.
Your beloved common man may marry for love.
Why not me?
If you were... a common man,
On what basis could you...
possibly claim to be King?
Sounds like you've studied our wretched Constitution.
- Sounds like you haven't.
- That's what this is about.
Brushing up.
Hence, the elocution lessons.
- That's the scoop around town.
- I'm trying to...
Yearning for a larger audience, are we, B-B-Bertie?
Don't...
What's that?
I'm sorry, I...
Younger brother trying to push older brother off the throne.
P-P-Positively mediaeval.
Wallis.
Ah.
Where have you been all this time?
- Who have you been talking to?
- Never you mind.
What a very complicated little King you are.
I try to be.
All that work... down the drain.
My own brother.
I couldn't say a single word to him in reply.
Why do you stammer so much more with David than you ever do with me?
Because you're bloody well paid to listen.
- Bertie, I'm not a geisha girl.
- Stop trying to be so bloody clever.
What is it about David that stops you speaking?
What is it about you that bloody well makes you want to go on about him
- the whole bloody time?
- Vulgar but fluent.
- You don't stammer when you swear.
- Bugger off!
- Is that the best you can do?
- Well, bloody bugger to you, you beastly bastard.
Oh, a public school prig could do better than that.
Shit.
Shit, shit, shit.
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit!
Yes, defecation flows trippingly from the tongue.
- Because I'm angry!
- Do you know the "f" word?
- Fornication?
- Oh, Bertie.
Fuck.
Fuck!
Fuck, fuck, fuckin' fuck!
Fuck, fuck and bugger!
Bugger, bugger, buggedy, fuck!
- Fuck, ass!
- Yes!
- Balls, balls, fuckety shit.
- You see?
Not a hesitation.
Willy, shit and fuck!
And tits.
- Dad, what's going on?
- Sorry.
Just finish your homework.
Well, that's a side of you we don't get to see all that often.
No.
No, we're not supposed to, really.
Not publicly.
- Let's get some air.
- No, I don't think that's a good idea.
What's the matter?
Why are you so upset?
Logue, you have no idea.
My... my brother is infatuated with a woman who's been married twice.
She's asking for a divorce, and he's determined to marry her.
- Jesus.
- Mrs. Wallis Simpson...
- ...of Baltimore.
- That's not right.
- Queen Wallis of Baltimore.
- Unthinkable.
- Can he do it?
- Absolutely not.
But he's going to anyway.
All hell's broken loose.
- Can't they just carry on privately?
- If only they would.
Where does this leave you?
I know my place.
I...
I...
I will do anything in my power to keep my brother on the throne.
Is it that serious?
- Your place may well be on the throne.
- I am not an alternative to my brother.
- You can outshine David.
- Don't take liberties!
- That's bordering on treason.
- I'm just saying you could be King.
- You could do it.
- That is treason.
I'm trying to get you to realize you needn't be governed by fear.
I've had enough of this.
- What are you so afraid of?
- Your poisonous words!
Why did you come to me?
You're not some middle-class banker who wants elocution lessons so you can chitchat...
Don't attempt to instruct me on my duties!
I am the son of a...
King.
And the brother of... of a King.
You're the disappointing son of a brewer.
A jumped-up jackeroo from the outback.
You're a nobody.
These sessions are over.
Through here, sir.
It's not because she's an American.
That is the least of it.
It's because she's a soon to be twice divorced American.
And the King, as head of the Church of England, cannot marry a divorced woman.
And, sir, I apologize for the nature of this.
According to Scotland Yard, the King has not always possessed exclusive rights to Mrs. Simpson's...
favors and affections sharing them with a married used car salesman, a certain Mr. Guy Trundle.
In addition, it is also rumored Hitler's ambassador,
Count von Ribbentrop, sends her 17 carnations every day.
Should His Majesty continue to ignore the advice of his government, he must abdicate.
Otherwise, his government has no choice but to resign.
Prime Minister, you'd leave a country without a a government?
Does the King do what he wants?
Or does he do what the people expect him to do?
As crowds in Downing Street watch ministers come and go, there is raised an age-old problem:
Can a king separate his personal life
- from his public duty...
- What's the matter, love?
I'm just having trouble with a patient.
That isn't like you.
- Why?
- He's scared.
He's afraid of his own shadow.
Isn't that why they come to you?
This fellow could really be somebody great.
He's fighting me.
Perhaps he doesn't want to be great.
Perhaps that's what you want.
I might have overstepped the mark.
Apologize.
Do you both good.
I'm very sorry, Mr. Logue, the Duke is busy.
I'm happy to wait.
Or I could come back later.
As I said, the Duke is terribly busy.
Thank you.
Parliament will not support the marriage.
But there are other reasons for concern.
He was careless with state papers.
He lacked commitment and resolve, and there are those who are worried about where he will stand when war comes with Germany.
- We're not coming to that?
- Indeed we are, sir.
Prime Minister Baldwin may deny this, but Hitler's intent is crystal clear.
War with Germany will come.
And we will need a King whom we can all stand behind, united.
I fear my brother is not of sound mind at this time.
Have you thought what you will call yourself?
Hmm?
Certainly not Albert, sir.
Too Germanic.
What about George?
After your father?
George the Sixth has a rather nice continuity to it.
Don't you think?
David.
Thank God.
You look exhausted.
How are you bearing up?
Bertie, the decision's been made.
I...
I'm going.
- I can't accept that...
- I'm afraid there's no other way.
I must marry her.
My mind's made up.
I'm... sorry.
That's a terrible thing to hear.
Nobody wants that.
I, least of all.
At long last,
I am able to say a few words of my own.
I have never wanted to withhold anything, but until now it has not been constitutionally possible for me to speak.
A few hours ago, I discharged my last duty as King and Emperor, and now that I have been succeeded by my brother, the Duke of York, my first words must be to declare my allegiance to him.
This I do with all my heart.
You all know the reasons which have impelled me to renounce the throne, but you must believe me when I tell you that I have found it impossible to carry the heavy burden
Of responsibility and to discharge my duties as King, as I would wish to do without the help and support of the woman I love.
And I want you to know, this decision has been made less difficult to me by the sure knowledge that my brother, with his long training in the public affairs of this country, and with his fine qualities,
will be able to take my place forthwith without interruption or injury to the life and progress of the Empire.
I meet you today in in circumstances which are...
- I'm sure you'll love it.
- There you go.
Thank you, darling.
Saddles.
Margaret.
- There's Montezuma.
- Oh, here's one.
- Mama, here's a horse and saddle.
- Thank you.
Oops.
- Don't worry, Sally.
We'll get you...
- Mama?
- Yes?
- Will we have space for our horses...
- ...in our new home?
- Course we will, darling.
We'll have a palace of rooms.
Curtsey.
Your Majesty.
How was it?
I was trying to...
familiarize myself with... what a state paper looks like.
It's a dispatch from Mr. Baldwin, which I don't understand a word of.
David's finances.
Christmas... broadcast.
- Think that would be a mistake.
- No, don't worry about that.
Oh.
Plans for the Coronation.
Think that would be an even bigger mistake.
- I'm not a King.
- Oh, shush.
I'm a Naval officer.
That's all I know.
I'm not a King.
I'm not a King.
- I'm sorry.
- No.
- I'm sorry.
- No, don't be silly.
Please.
Oh, my dear.
My dear, dear man.
- I'm sorry.
- You know,
I refused your first two marriage proposals, not because I didn't love you, but because I couldn't bear the idea of a Royal life.
Couldn't bear the idea of a life of tours, public duty, of...
Well, a life that no longer was really to be my own.
But then I thought, he stammers so beautifully, they'll leave us alone.
Waiting for a King to apologize, one can wait rather a long wait.
I'm afraid we're slightly late.
This is home.
Myrtle's at bridge.
I made sure the boys were out.
It's lovely.
Absolutely lovely.
- Oh!
May I sit down?
- Yes, of course.
- Would you like some tea, ma'am?
- Yes, I'll help myself.
Now, off you go.
Or must I knock your heads together?
Here's your shilling.
I...
I understand what you were trying to say, Logue.
I went about it the wrong way.
I'm sorry.
So, here I am.
Is the nation ready for two...
minutes of radio silence?
Every stammerer always fears going back to square one.
I don't let that happen.
If I fail in my duty,
David could come back.
I've seen the placards.
"God save our...
King."
They don't mean me.
Every monarch in history has succeeded someone who's dead
Or just about to be.
My predecessor is not only alive, but very much so.
It's a bloody mess.
Couldn't even give them a Christmas speech.
- Like your dad used to do?
- Precisely.
He's not here anymore.
Yes, he is.
He's on that shilling I gave you.
Easy enough to give away.
You don't have to carry him around in your pocket.
Or your brother.
You don't need to be afraid of the things you were afraid of when you were five.
You're very much your own man, Bertie.
Am I?
- Your face is next, mate.
- Lionel, dear!
Myrtle.
- Is this your wife?
- Yes.
Bertie.
Come here.
- Are you all right, Logue?
- Yes.
- Shouldn't we go through?
- Trust me, it's important.
- What is it?
- Oh!
- You're...
- It's "Your Majesty" the first time.
After that, it's "Ma'am." As in "ham."
Not "malm" as in "palm."
I haven't told her about us.
Sit down, relax.
I'm told your husband calls my husband Bertie.
And my husband calls your husband Lionel.
I trust you won't call me Liz.
Your Majesty, you may call me Mrs. Logue, ma'am.
Very nice to meet you, Mrs. Logue.
- Logue, we can't stay here all day.
- Yes, we can.
- Logue!
- I need to wait for the right moment.
- Logue, you're being a coward.
- You're damn right.
Get out there, man.
Hello, Myrtle, darling.
You're early.
I believe you two have met, but I don't think you know king George the Sixth.
- It's very nice to meet you.
Will Their Majesties be staying to dinner?
We'd love to, such a treat, but alas a previous engagement.
What a pity.
- Archbishop.
- Welcome, Your Majesty.
What a glorious transformation, sir.
I hope you'll forgive us if we continue our preparations?
Now, allow me to guide you through the ceremony.
We begin, of course, at the West door into the nave.
I see all your pronouncements are to be broadcast, Archbishop.
Ah, yes.
Wireless.
It is, indeed, a Pandora's box, and I'm afraid I've also had to permit the newsreel cameras.
The product of which I shall personally edit.
Without momentary hesitations.
This is Dr. Logue of Harley Street.
He's... my speech therapist.
- Your Grace.
- Had I known that Your Majesty was seeking assistance, I should have made my own recommendation.
Dr. Logue will will be attending the Coronation.
Of course I'll speak to the Dean, but it will be extremely difficult.
I should like the doctor to be seated in the King's Box.
But members of your family will be seated there, sir.
That is why it is suitable.
And now, if you don't mind, Your Grace, we need the premises.
My dear fellow, this is Westminster Abbey.
The Church must prepare His Majesty.
My preparations are equally as important.
With complete privacy, if you don't mind.
Those are my wishes, Your Grace.
I will place the Abbey at Your Majesty's disposal, this evening.
Your Majesty.
I can't believe I'm walking on Chaucer and Handel and Dickens.
Everything all right?
Let's get cracking.
I'm not here to rehearse, Dr. Logue.
Call me Lionel.
True, you... never called yourself Doctor.
I did that for you.
No training.
No diploma, no qualifications.
Just... a great deal of nerve.
The Star Chamber inquisition, is it?
You asked for trust.
And... total equality.
Bertie, I heard you at Wembley.
I was there.
My son Laurie said, "Dad, do you think you could help that poor man?"
- What, as a failed actor?
- It's true.
I'm not a doctor.
And yes, I acted, a bit.
Well, I recited in pubs.
I taught elocution in schools.
When the Great War came, all our soldiers were returning to Australia from the front, a lot of them shell-shocked, unable to speak.
Somebody said, Lionel, "You're very good at this speech stuff.
Do you think you could possibly help these poor buggers?"
I did muscle therapy, exercises, relaxation, but I knew I had to go deeper.
Those poor young blokes had cried out in fear.
No one was listening to them.
My job was to give them faith in their own voice, and let them know that a friend was listening.
That must ring a few bells with you, Bertie.
You give a very noble account of yourself.
- Make inquiries.
It's all true.
- Inquiries have been made.
You have no idea who I have breathing down my neck.
I vouched for you, and you have no...
- ...credentials.
- But lots of success.
I can't show you a certificate.
There was no training then.
Everything I know, I know from experience.
And that war was some experience.
My plaque says, "L. Logue, Speech Defects."
Not "Doctor." There are no letters after my name.
- Lock me in the Tower.
- I would if I could.
- On what charge?
- Fraud.
With war looming, you've saddled this nation with a voiceless King.
You've destroyed the happiness of my family, all for the sake of ensnaring a star... patient you couldn't possibly hope to assist.
It'll be like mad King George the Third.
I'll be...
Mad King George the Stammerer who let his people down so badly in their hour of need.
What are you doing?
Get up!
You can't sit there!
Get up!
- Why not?
It's a chair.
- No, it...
That is not a chair!
That is...
That...
- That is Saint Edward's chair.
- People have carved their names on it.
That chair is the seat on which every King...
- It's held in place by a large rock.
- That is the Stone of Scone!
- You are trivializing everything.
- I don't care how many royal assholes
- ...have sat on this chair.
- Listen to me!
Listen to me!
- Listen to you?
By what right?
- By Divine Right, if you must.
- I am your King!
- No, you're not.
You told me so yourself.
You said you didn't want it.
Why should I waste my time listening to you?
Because I have a right to be heard!
I have a voice!
Yes, you do.
You have such perseverance, Bertie.
You're the bravest man I know.
You'll make a bloody good King.
- What on earth is going on, sir?
- It's quite all right, Archbishop.
Mr. Logue, you must know that
I've found a replacement English specialist with impeccable credentials.
Hence, your services will no longer be required.
- I'm sorry?
- Your Majesty's function is to consult and be advised.
Now, you didn't consult,
- ...but you have just been advised.
- And now I advise you.
In this personal matter, I will make my own decision.
My concern is for the head on which I must place the crown.
I appreciate that, Archbishop.
But it's my head.
Your humble servant.
Thank you, Bertie.
Shall we rehearse?
Come on.
Up on your perch.
Now, when you and Elizabeth enter through the West door, you will be greeted by the hymn "I was glad when they said unto me."
Actually, you won't be that glad because they do sing it for a very long time.
Then your friend, the Archbishop, will ponce up the stairs towards you, and say, "Sir, is Your Majesty willing to take the oath?"
- "I am willing."
- Well, of course you are.
I'm gonna see what this sounds like in the cheap seats, so even your old nanny can hear.
"Will you govern your peoples, Great Britain, Ireland, Canada,
Australia and New Zealand, according to their lands and customs?"
- "I SOLEMNLY PROMISE TO DO SO!"
- Louder.
- I can't hear you up the back.
- "I solemnly promise to do so."
Very good. "And will you, to your power, cause Law and Justice, in Mercy to be executed in all your judgments?"
"I will. "I WILL!"
Then there's a very long bit about upholding the faith.
It goes on, rubbish, rubbish, rubbish, to which you finally say...
"The things which I have...
here before promised,
I will perform and keep.
So help me God."
And that's all you say.
Four short responses.
Kiss the book, sign the oath, and you're King.
Easy.
You nearly crowned him backwards, Archbishop.
Someone had removed the thread marking the back of the crown, sir.
Try not to lose the thread, Archbishop.
Archbishop, we're missing Papa.
- God save the King.
- Very good.
Very good, Archbishop.
Well, I hope Your Majesties are thrilled with the result.
- You can switch that machine off.
- No, wait.
Keep going.
- Nazism has held its great convention.
- Do take a seat, Archbishop.
Masses of uniformed men, stupefying to the eye, and incredible to the imagination have stood in spellbound audience of the Fuhrer.
- Papao Papa, what's he saying?
- Hmm?
I don't know, but he seems to be saying it rather well.
Sir...
I have asked to see you today in order to tender my resignation as Prime Minister.
I'm so sorry to hear that, Mr. Baldwin.
Neville Chamberlain will take my place as Prime Minister.
It's a matter of principle.
I was mistaken.
I have found it impossible to believe that there is any man in the world so lacking in moral feeling as Hitler, that the world may be hurled for a second time into the abyss of destructive war.
Churchill was right all along.
This was always Hitler's intention.
I'm only very sorry to leave you at this great time of crisis.
I'm very much afraid, sir, that your greatest test is yet to come.
I am speaking to you from the Cabinet room at 10 Downing Street.
This morning, the British ambassador in Berlin handed the German government a final note stating that unless we heard from them by 11:00, that they were prepared at once to withdraw their troops from Poland, ...a state of war would exist between us.
I have to tell you now that no such undertaking has been received, and that, consequently, this country is at war with Germany.
At last, sir, here is your speech.
You are on air at six.
I have timed it to just under nine minutes.
The wording is fully approved.
The Prime Minister will be joining you for the broadcast, which will go out live across the nation, the Empire
- ...and to our armed forces.
- Get Logue here immediately.
- There's the barrage balloons.
- Yes.
- They got them up there quickly.
- Yeah.
- Shall we pull over and find a shelter?
- No, no.
Go straight there.
We'll be all right.
- Yes, sir?
- Lionel Logue.
Major Hartley is expecting me.
This is my son, Laurie.
- Thank you, Laurie.
- Good luck, Dad.
- The King's speech.
- Thank you, sir.
We have about 40 minutes to the broadcast.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
There may be dark days ahead and...
- Try again.
There may be dark days ahead, and...
Turn the hesitations into pauses and say to yourself, "God save the King."
I say that continuously, but apparently no one's listening.
Long pauses are good.
They add solemnity to great occasions.
Then I'm the solemnest king who ever lived.
You know, if I'm a king, where's my power?
Can I... can I form a government?
Can I... can I...
levy a tax?
Declare a... a war?
No.
And yet I'm the seat of all authority.
Why?
Because the nation believes that when I...
I speak,
I speak for them.
But I can't speak.
Let's take it all again from the top.
"In this grave hour."
In this grave hour...
Fuck, fuck, fuck.
Perhaps the most fateful in our history...
Bugger, shit, shit.
I send to every household of my...
You see, "P" is always difficult, even when I'm singing.
Bounce on to it. "A peoples."
A people.
A people.
Household of my peoples, both at home
- ...and overseas.
- Beautiful.
This message...
Doo-dah
Spoken with the same depth of feeling, Doo-dah day, ...for each one of you, as if I were able to...
Shit, fuck, bugger!
...cross your threshold and speak to you...
In your head now. "I have a right to be bloody well heard."
Bloody well heard, bloody well heard myself!
Now, waltz.
Move.
Get continuous movement.
"For the second time in the lives of most of us...
- "We are at..." - "We are," take a pause.
- Lionel, I can't do this.
- Bertie, you can do it.
- Have a look at the last paragraph.
- Bertie.
It's time.
There he is.
- Archbishop.
- Your Majesty.
A great moment, Sir.
- Prime Minister.
- Your Majesty.
Nice to see you... again so soon.
Good of you to be here.
I'm sure you have had...
- ...a rather busy day.
- I hope we have no more interruptions...
- ...from those damn sirens, sir.
- Or the wretched dogs.
Congrat...
Congratulations.
- First Lord of the Admiralty.
- Your Majesty.
The long... walk.
Good luck, sir.
I, too, dread this apparatus.
Had a speech impediment myself, you know.
- I didn't.
- Family secret.
Tongue-tied.
An operation was considered to be too dangerous.
I eventually made an asset of it.
- Thank you, Mr. Churchill.
- Sir.
Darling.
- How long, Logue?
- Just under three minutes.
- Mr. Wood.
- Good luck, Your Majesty.
Mr. Wood.
- You've redecorated, Logue.
- I made it cozy.
- Some fresh air.
- There you are, darling.
I'm a thistle-sifter.
I've a sieve of sifted thistles and a sieve of unsifted thistles.
A sieve of sifted thistles and a sieve of unsifted thistles.
- Because I'm...
- Bertie.
Darling.
Make sure it's not switched on.
Remember, the red light will blink four times, then I've asked them to turn it off.
'Cause we don't want that evil eye staring at you all the way through.
One minute, sir.
I'm sure you'll be splendid.
Forty seconds, sir.
Logue.
However this turns out I don't know how to thank you...
for what you've done.
Knighthood?
Twenty seconds.
Forget everything else, and just say it to me.
Say it to me as a friend.
In this grave hour perhaps the most fateful in our history I send to every household of my a- peoples both at home and overseas...
...this message spoken with the same depth of feeling for each one of you as if I were able to cross your threshold and speak to you... myself.
For the second time in the lives of most of us we are... at...
Fuck, fuck, fuck!
...at war.
Very good.
Over and over again we have tried to find a peaceful way out of the differences between ourselves and those who are now our... enemies.
But it has been... in vain.
We have been forced into a conflict, for we are called to meet the challenge of a principle, which, if it were to prevail, would be fatal to any civilized order in the world.
Such a principle, stripped of all disguise, is surely the mere primitive doctrine that might is right.
For the sake of all that we ourselves hold dear, it is unthinkable that we should refuse to meet the challenge.
It is to this high purpose that I now call my people at home, and my peoples across the seas, who will make our cause their own.
I ask them to stand calm and firm and united in this time of trial.
The task will be hard.
There may be dark days ahead, and war can no longer be confined to the battlefield.
But we can only do the right as we see the right, and reverently commit
Our cause to God.
If one and all we keep resolutely faithful to it, then, with God's help, we shall... prevail.
It was very good, Bertie.
You still stammered on the "W."
Well, I had to throw in a few, so they knew it was me.
Congratulations, Your Majesty.
A true broadcaster.
Thank you, Mr. Wood.
- Congratulations, Your Majesty.
- Sir.
- Congratulations, Your Majesty.
- Thank you.
Ready.
- Good?
- Perfect, sir.
Your first wartime speech.
Congratulations.
I expect I shall have to...
do a great deal more.
Thank you, Logue.
Well done.
My friend.
Thank you Your Majesty.
I knew you'd be good.
Thank you...
Lionel.
Onwards.
- Congratulations, sir.
- Well done, sir.
Couldn't have said it better myself, sir.
Your Majesty, I am speechless.
- Congratulations, sir.
- Gentlemen.
- So how was Papa, Elizabeth?
- Halting at first,
- But you got much better, Papa.
- Well, bless you.
- And how about you, Margaret?
- You were just splendid, Papa.
Of course I was.
Are we all ready?
Come on, girls.
You are live in two minutes, Your Royal Highness.
Sir?
Thank you.
Let the microphone do the work, Sir.
I'm sure you will be splendid.
Just take your time.
Time to go.
Good afternoon.
This is the BBC National Programme and Empire Service taking you to Wembley Stadium for the closing ceremony of the Empire Exhibition where His Royal Highness the Duke of York will read a message from his father,
His Majesty, King George V.
Fifty eight British Colonies and Dominions have taken part, making this the largest Exhibition staged anywhere in the world.
Remember Sir, three flashes.
Then steady red means you are live.
Using the new invention of radio, the opening ceremony was the first time his Majesty the King addressed his subjects on the wireless.
At the close of the first season,
The heir to the throne, His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales, made his first broadcast.
And today, his younger brother, His Royal Highness, the Duke of York will give his inaugural broadcast to the Nation and the World.
I have received... from his Majesty....th... th... th... th the King.
a... a...
Inhale deep into your lungs.
Your Royal Highness.
Relaxes your larynx, does it not?
Cigarette smoking calms the nerves and gives you confidence.
Now, if Your Highness will be very kind as to open your hand.
It's sterilized.
One... two... three, four, five... six, seven.
Now, if I may take the liberty.
Insert them into your mouth.
Excuse me, Doctor.
What is the purpose of this?
It's the classic approach, it cured Demosthenes.
That was in Ancient Greece...uh
Has it worked since?
Now, if you would be so kind as to read...
A Wealth of Words.
Fight against those marbles, Your Royal Highness.
Enunciate!
A little more concentration your Royal Highness.
I nearly swallowed the bloody things!
Thank you so much, Doctor, it's been most...hmm interesting.
Your Royal Highness.
Insert marbles!
He can insert his own bloody marbles!
Tick, tock, tick, tock.
You know, you can't keep doing this, Bertie.
I know.
Promise me...
Promise me no more.
Hello.
Is anyone there?
I'm just in the loo.
Ah, Mrs.Johnson There you are.
I'm sorry I don't have a receptionist.
I like to keep things simple.
"Poor and content is rich and rich enough"
Sorry?
Shakespeare.
How are you?
How do you do?
Troughing along.
Now, this is slightly awkward, but I'm afraid you're late.
Yes, I'm afraid I am.
Where's Mr Johnson?
He doesn't know I'm here.
That's not a very promising start.
No.
No, look, umm...
My husband has seen everyone to no avail.
I'm awefully afraid he's given up hope.
He hasn't seen me.
You're awfully sure of yourself.
Well, I'm sure of anyone who wants to be cured.
Of course, he wants to be cured.
My husband is, umm..
he's required to speak publicly.
Perhaps he should change jobs.
He can't.
Indentured servitude?
Something of that nature, yes.
Well, we need to have your hubby pop by...
Uh..
Tuesday would be good...
He can give me his personal details and I'll make a frank appraisal and then we'll take it from there.
Doctor, forgive me.
I don't have a "hubby".
We don't 'pop'.
and nor do we ever talk about our private lives.
No, you... must come to us.
I'm sorry, Mrs Johnson, my game, my turf, my rules.
You'll have to talk this over this with your husband and then you can speak to me on the telephone.
Thank you very much for dropping by.
Good afternoon.
And what if my husband were the Duke of York?
The Duke of York?
Yes...
the Duke of York.
I thought the appointment was for Johnson.
Forgive me, your ...?
...Royal Highness.
Royal Highness.
Johnson was used during the Great War, when the Navy didn't want the enemy to know he was aboard.
Am I considered the enemy?
You will be, if you remain unobliging.
You will appreciate the need for absolute discretion.
Of course.
How did you find me, your Royal Highness?
The President of the Society of Speech Therapists.
Eileen McCleod?
She's a sport.
She warned me your antipodean methods were unorthodox and controversial.
I warned her those were not my favorite words.
I can cure your husband.
But for my method to work I need trust and total equality.
Here, in the safety of my consultation room.
No exceptions.
Oh well, in that case...
When can you start?
She still sounds a little bit rough, mate.
You make me drive too slowly, Dad!
Did you pick mum up from bridge?
Yes, I've hardly been out of the car all day.
I had a special visitor this afternoon.
May I please leave this table How special is special?
No, you must stay bored stupid and listen to your parents' inane conversation.
Thanks Dad.
And Mum...
And Mum.
Me too.
Are you meeting Jean?
No, someone else.
Doctor?
Doctor?
Go and help your brother with the washing up.
I'm fine.
Who is it Lionel?
Why bring it up if you can't talk about it?
Myrtle, it's just a woman looking to help her husband.
Oh, and I had a call for an audition.
One of my favorites.
Aren't they all?
It could be a lot of fun.
I'm sure you'll be splendid.
In the amateur scene they're a highly regarded group.
From Putney.
Tomorrow, Chapter IV:
The Flight.
But, Mama, I long to know where they fly to...
Oh, I can't wait!
Oh, to fly away!
Aren't they lucky!
Now Papa tell a story!
Couldn't I be a penguin instead?
Now I want to hear a penguin story.
Very quickly.
Once, there were two princesses...
Princess Elizabeth and Princess Margaret.
whose Papa was a penguin.
This was because he'd been turned into one by a wicked witch.
This was very inconvenient for him because he loved..
to hold his princesses in his arms... but you can't if you're a penguin because you... you don't have wings like herrings
Herrings don't have wings.
Penguins have wings which are shaped like herrings'.
And what made matters worse... is that she sent him to the South Pole, which is an awfully long walk back... if you can't fly.
So when he reached the water, he dived in through the depths, so fast... that he was in Southampton waters by lunchtime.
And from there, he took the 2.30 to Weybridge, changed at Clapham Junction, asked a passing Mallard the way to Buckingham Palace.
He swam up the Thames, out through the plughole, and gave the cook,
Mama and Mrs Whittaker quite a shock.
Now when the girls heard all the commotions, they ran to the kitchen where they gave him a good scrub, a mackerel and a kiss.
And as they kissed him, guess what he turned in to?
A handsome prince.
A short-tailed albatross.
With wings so big that he could wrap them both around his two girls together.
Now, girls... time for bed.
Come on.
And take those horses to the stable?
Fifty-nine...you have exactly a minute.
Good night.
Feed them fast and then to bed.
Will Mrs Simpson be there?
My brother's insisting.
Is this serious?
About her coming to dinner?
No.
About her!
A married woman?
He can't be.
She can.
By the way, I think I found someone rather interesting.
On Harley Street.
A doctor.
Out of the question.
I'm not having this conversation again.
The matter's settled.
His approach seems rather different....
Now?
Now.
Now is the winter of our discontent,
Made glorious summer by this sun of York".
And all the clouds that lour'd upon our house
In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.
Now are our brows, bound with victorious wreaths.
Thank you!
Lovely diction Mr...?
Logue.
Lionel Logue.
Well, Mr. Logue.
I'm not hearing the cries of a deformed creature yearning to be King.
Nor did I realize Richard the Third was King of the Colonies.
I do know all the lines.
I've played the role before.
Sydney?
Perth.
Major theater town, is it?
Enthusiastic.
Ah.
I was well reviewed.
Yes...
Well...
Lionel,
I think our dramatic society, is looking for someone slightly younger and... a little more regal.
No, you have to shut that one first.
Close that one first?
That's it.
Where did you find this... physician?
Classifieds, next to "French model, Shepherd's Market".
He comes highly recommended.
Charges substantial fees to help the poor.
Oh dear, perhaps he's a Bolshevik?
!
There's no receptionist.
He likes to keep things simple.
Hmmm...
The Johnsons.
You can go in now, Mr. Johnson.
Lionel says... wait here if you wish, Mrs Johnson.
Or, it being a... pleasant day,
p-perhaps take a stroll.
Was that all right, Lionel?
Marvelous!
Willy.
You can stay here and wait for your mom.
Mrs Johnson...
Mr Johnson, do come in.
Relax, sweetie.
He's a good lad, Willy.
He could hardly make a sound, you know, when he first came to me.
My boys made those.
They're good, aren't they?
Please make yourself comfortable.
I was told not to sit too close.
Well I believe when speaking with a Prince, one waits for the prince to choose the topic.
Waiting for me to...
commence a conversation ..
one can wait a rather a long wait.
Do you know any jokes?
Timing isn't my strong suit.
Cup of tea?
No, thank you.
I think I'll have one.
Aren't you going to start treating me, Dr Logue?
Only if you're interested in being treated.
Please, call me Lionel.
I prefer Doctor.
I prefer Lionel.
What'll I call you?
Your Royal Highness.
Then Sir after that.
It's a little bit formal for here.
I prefer names.
Prince Albert...
Frederick Arthur George.
How about Bertie?
Only my family uses that.
Perfect.
In here, it's better if we're equals.
If we were equals I wouldn't be here.
I'd be at home with my wife and no one would give a damn.
Please, don't do that.
I'm sorry?
I believe, sucking smoke into your lungs will kill you.
My physicians say it relaxes the throat.
They're idiots.
They've all been knighted.
Makes it official then.
My castle, my rules.
Thank you.
What was your earliest memory?
What on earth do you mean?
Your first recollection.
I'm not... here to discuss personal matters.
Why are you here then?
Because I bloody well stammer!
You have a bit of a temper?
One of my many faults.
When did the defect start?
I've always been this way!
I doubt that.
Don't tell me!
It's my stammer!
Its my field.
I can assure you, no infant starts to speak with a stammer.
When did yours start?
Four or five.
That's typical.
So I've been told.
I can't remember not doing it.
I can believe that.
Do you hesitate when you think?
Don't be ridiculous.
How about when you talk to yourself?
Everyone natters to themselves occasionally, Bertie.
Stop calling me that!
I'm not going to call you anything else.
Then we shan't speak!
Are you charging for this, Doctor?
A fortune.
I'll just let that brew.
So, when you talk to yourself, do you stammer?
Of course not!
Well, that proves your impediment isn't a permanent part of you.
What do you think was the cause?
I don't know.
I don't care!
I stammer!
No one can fix it.
I'll bet you that you can read flawlessly, right here, right now.
And if I win the bet, I get to ask you more questions.
And if I win?
Then you don't have to answer.
One usually... wagers money.
A bob each to keep it sweet?
Let's see your shilling?
I don't... carry money.
I had a funny feeling you mightn't.
I'll stake you.
You can pay me back next time.
Who says there is a next time?
I haven't agreed to take you on yet.
Please stand and take a look at that...
From there.
I can't read this.
Well, then you owe me a shilling for not trying.
"To be...
or not to be....
That...
I can't read!
I haven't finished yet.
I'm going to record your voice and then play it back to you on the same machine.
This is brilliant.
It's the latest thing from America.
It's a Silvertone.
Pop these on?
There's a bob in this, mate.
You can go home rich!
You're playing music.
I know.
So how can I hear what I'm saying?
!
Surely a Prince's brain knows what its mouth is doing?
You're not well acquainted with Royal Princes, are you?
Hopeless.
Hopeless!
You were sublime.
Would I lie to a Prince of the realm to win twelve pennies?
I've no idea what an Australian might do for that sort of money.
Let me play it back to you.
No.
All right then, I get to ask you the questions.
Thank you, Doctor.
I don't feel..
this is for me.
Thank you for your time.
Bye.
Sir?
The recording is free.
Please keep it as a souvenir.
No.
Oh, well.
Bugger.
For the present, the work to which we are all equally bound, is to arrive at a reasoned tranquility within our borders, to regain prosperity at this time of depression without self-seeking and to carry with us those whom the burden of the past years has disheartened or overborne.
To all, to each,
I wish a Happy Christmas.
God bless you.
Easy when you know how.
Sir.
Have a go yourself.
Congratulations, Sir.
Ah, Mr Wood.
Splendid fellow.
Chap taught me everything I know.
Let the microphone do the work.
Thank you.
Sit up, straight back, face boldly up to the bloody thing and stare it square in the eye, as you would any decent Englishman.
Show who's in command.
Papa, I don't...
think I can read this.
This devilish device will change everything if you don't.
In the past all a King had to do was look respectable in uniform and not fall off his horse.
Now we must invade people's homes and ingratiate ourselves with them.
This family has been reduced to those lowest, basest of all creatures... we've become actors.
We're not a family, we're a firm.
Yet at any moment, some of us may be out of work.
Your darling brother, and future king!
The only wife he appears interested in is invariably the wife of another!
He's broken off with Lady Furness.
And taken up a Mrs Simpson, a woman with two husbands living!
I told him straight, no divorced person could ever be received at court.
He said it made him sublimely happy.
I imagined that was because she was sleeping with him.
I give you my word...
this is what he said.
I give you my word we've never had immoral relations.
Stared square into his father's face...
and lied!
When I'm dead that boy will ruin himself, this family, and this nation, within twelve months.
Who'll pick up the pieces?
Herr Hitler, intimidating half of Europe?
Marshall Stalin the other half?
Who will stand between us, the jackboots, and the proletarian abyss?
You?
With your older brother shirking his duties, you're going to have to do a lot more of this.
Have a go yourself.
Through the... wireless...
Get it out boy!
one of the... marvels of...
Modern.
Just take your time.
Form your words carefully.
science, I am enabled...
Relax!
Just try it!
this Christmas Day... to speak to all my...
Do it!
Lying... bastard.
You're playing music.
I know.
So how can I hear what I'm saying?
Surely a Prince's brain knows what its mouth is doing?
You're not well acquainted with Royal Princes, are you?
To be, or not to be, that is the question:
...whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles, and by opposing, end them.."
..to die...
to sleep; no more.."
and by a sleep to say we end The heartache and the thousand natural shocks the flesh is heir to...
'Tis a consummation...
Hopeless!
Hopeless
Strictly business.
No... personal nonsense.
I thought I'd made that clear in our interview.
Have you got the shilling you owe me?
No I haven't!
Didn't think so.
Besides, you tricked me!
Physical excercises and tricks are important... but what you're asking will only deal with the surface of the problem.
Well that's sufficient.
No, as far as I see it, my husband... has mechanical difficulties with his speech.
Maybe just deal with that.
I'm willing to work hard, Doctor Logue...
Lionel.
Are you..
are you willing to do your part?
All right.
You want mechanics?
We need to relax your jaw muscles, strengthen your tongue.
By repeating tongue twisters, for example.
I am a thistle-sifter.
I have a sieve of sifted thistles and a sieve of unsifted thistles.
Because I am a thistle sifter."
Fine!
You do have a flabby tummy, so we need to spend some time strengthening your diaphragm.
Simple mechanics.
That's all we ask.
And that's about a shilling's worth.
Forget about the blessed shilling!
Perhaps, upon occasion, you might be requested to assist in coping with some minor event.
Will that agreeable?
Of course.
That would be the full extent of your services.
Shall I see you next week?
I shall see you every day.
Ahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahah.
Feel the looseness of the jaw
Little bounces, bounces.
Shoulders.
Good.
Good.
Now loose.
Take a nice deep breath.
Expand the chest...
Put your hands onto your ribs.
Deeper.
Good.
How do you feel?
Full of hot air.
Isn't that what public speaking is all about?
My wife and I... are glad to visit this important...
Take a deep breath, and up comes Your Royal Highness and slowly exhale, and down comes Your Royal Highness.
Are you all right, Bertie?
This is actually quite good fun,
Mmmmm-other Shorten the humming each time.
Mmmm...
Mother.
Mmmm...
Mmm-anufacturing a district
Now a deep breath and...
Jack and Jill...
Jack and Jill... went up the hill.
Went up the hill...
Now just sway.
Perfect.
Will not permit us to...
Loosen the shoulders.
Ding-dong bell What is in the well?
Who put her in?
Little Tomly Tim.
You have a short memory, Bertie.
Come on.
A cow.. a cow... a cow
A king... aaaaaaaaaa...
Anyone who can shout vowels in an open window can learn to deliver a speech.
And fifty.
a deep breath and... it is...
Let the words flow.
No, it doesn't bloody work.
Come on, one more time, Bertie, you can do it.
A sieve of sifted thistles
Father...
Father...
Father...
Father
Hello, Bertie.
Hello David.
Nice of you to come out.
Not at all.
Have you been waiting long?
Christ, it's bloody freezing.
Where've you been?
I've been busy.
So have I.
Elizabeth has pneumonia.
I'm sorry.
She'll recover.
Father won't.
I'll drive.
Old bugger's doing this on purpose.
Dying?
Departing prematurely...
to complicate matters with Wallis.
For heaven's sake, David.
You know how long he's been ill.
Wallis explained.
She's terribly clever about these things.
... whereas by letters patent under the Great Seal, bearing date of Westminster, the eleventh day of June 1912 his Majesty King George V did constitute, order and declare that there should be a guardian,
Custos Regni, in the form of Councilors of State
It's the order of the Council for the State, Sir.
So that we may act on your behalf.
you'll have to clear it for me, I'm afraid, Lord Wagram.
I'm still confused, but...
Approved.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Feeling a little better, Sir?
No, I'm not feeling any better.
I feel dreadful.
Have you been ice skating?
..Ice skating.
No, George.
Yes, yes, all right, of course I know, darling, a talk, even a lovely long talk, is a poor substitute for holding tight and making drowsy.
Nor making our own drowsies either, as we've had to do far too often lately.
David, dinner?
I'm on with Wallis!
It's Bertie.
No.
No, it's not important.
I don't want to...
No.
Telephone me later.
All right.
Bye.
Wallis misses me terribly.
Mama says you're late for dinner.
She forgets Papa's bloody clocks were always half an hour fast!
How is the king?
I hope he is not in pain.
No, no, His Majesty, he's quieter now.
Thank you.
David, If your father were well, tardiness would not be tolerated.
None of this unpleasantness would be tolerated
You know Sir, I appreciate that you are different from your father both in outlook and temperament.
I want you to know that whenever the King questioned your conduct,
I tried, in your interest, to present it in the most favorable light.
I can always trust you to have my best interests at heart.
I fear our vigil will not be of long duration.
Please, continue.
We commend our brother George to the mercy of God, our Maker and Redeemer.
Long live the King.
I hope I will make good as he has made good.
What on earth was that?
Poor Wallis.
Now I'm trapped.
And in these last 25 clouded, troubled, glorious years if there is one thing that King George has taught it is the art of the leader who is also the brother to his followers.
As long as he lived he was the guiding star of a great many.
Dad?
Hm-hm?
Time for a shake, dad?
You sure?
Go on.
Put your thinking caps on.
I bet its a Scottish Play.
No, it's Othello.
It's always Othello.
Art thou afeard?
Be not afeard.
Caliban!
Oh!
For heaven's sake.
That was a lucky guess!
Don't listen to egghead.
Go on, Dad.
The isle is full of noises, sounds and sweet airs that give delight, and hurt not.
Sometimes a thousand twangling instruments will hum about mine ears and sometimes voices that, if then I had waked after long sleep, will make me sleep again.
Alright, clever clogs, and what comes next?
And then, in dreaming, methought the clouds...
The clouds methought... the clouds methought would open and show riches ready to drop upon me that when I waked..."
I cried to dream again.
That's a sad thought.
My next patient must be a bit early.
You better go lads, I'm sorry.
Won't be a moment, Clifford.
Bertie!
They told me not to expect you.
I'm sorry about your father.
I don't wish to intrude.
Oh, no... please come in.
I've been practicing.
An hour a day.
In spite of everything.
What's going on there?
I was, sorry, mocking around with my kids.
Do you feel like working today?
A Curtis bi-plane.
I'll put on some hot milk.
Logue, Logue.
I'd kill for something stronger.
I wasn't there for my father's death.
Still makes me sad.
I can imagine so.
What did you father do?
He was a brewer.
At least there was free beer.
Here's to the memory of your father.
I was informed, after the fact... that my father's last words were:
"Bertie has more guts than the rest of his brothers put together."
He couldn't say that to my face.
My brother.
What about him?
Try singing it.
I'm sorry.
What songs do you know?
Songs?
Yes, songs.
Swanee River.
I love that song.
It happens to be my favorite.
Sing with the chorus.
No.
Certainly not.
I always wanted to build models.
Father wouldn't allow it.
He collected stamps.
We had to collect stamps.
You can finish that off if you sing.
My brother David dum de dum dum...
I'm not going to sit here warbling.
You can with me.
But you're peculiar.
I take that as a compliment.
Rules are rules.
I'm not crooning Swanee River!
Camptown Races, then.
My brother David said to me, doo-dah doo-dah...
Continuous sound will give you flow.
Does it feel strange, now that David's on the throne?
To tell the truth,
It was a relief... knowing I wouldn't be King.
But unless he produces an heir, you're next in line.
And your daughter, Elizabeth, would then succeed you.
You're barking up the wrong tree now, Doctor, Doctor.
Lionel.
See?
You didn't stammer.
Of course I didn't stammer, I was singing!
Well, as a little reward, you get to put some glue on these struts.
Your boy won't mind?
No, not at all.
David and I were very close.
Young bucks, you know.
Would you chase the same girls?
David was always very helpful in arranging introductions.
We would share the expert ministrations of Paulette in Paris.
Not at the same time of course.
Did David ever tease you?
Oh, yes, they all did.
"Buh-buh-buh-Bertie".
Father encouraged it. "Get it out, boy!" Said it would make me stop.
He said: "I was afraid of my father, and my children are damn well going to be afraid of me".
Are you naturally right-hand?
Left.
I was punished.
Now I use the right.
Yes, that's very common with stammerers.
Any other corrections?
Knock knees.
Metal splints were made.
Worn day and night.
That must have been painful.
Bloody agony.
Straight legs now.
Who were you closest to in your family?
Nannies.
Not my first nanny.
She loved David... hated me.
When we are presented to my parents for the daily viewing, she'd pinch me, so that I'd cry and be handed back to her immediately.
Then she would...
Sing it.
then she wouldn't feed me, far far away.
It took my parents three years to notice.
As you can imagine, it caused some stomach problems.
Still.
What about your brother, Johnny?
Were you close to him?
Johnny..
Sweet boy.
Epilepsy...and... he was different.
He died at 13, hidden from view.
I'm told it's not catching.
Do you want a top up?
Please.
You know, Lionel, you're the first ordinary Englishman...
Australian.
...I've ever really spoken to.
When I'm driven through the streets and I see, you know, the common man staring at me,
I'm struck by how little I know of his life, and how little he knows of mine.
Thank you.
What are friends for?
I wouldn't know.
I sifted seven thick-stalked thistles through strong thick sieves.
I sifted seven...
Stop now, darling.
I have to keep doing this.
I sifted seven...
Oh, no.
One hundred year old spruces removed to improve the view!
Who does she think she is!
Nonetheless, we must try to be pleasant towards Mrs Simpson.
You know she calls me the fat Scottish cook.
You're not fat.
I'm getting plump.
You seldom cook.
I sifted seven.
Shut up!
Their Royal Highnesses the Duke and Duchess of York.
How lovely to see you both.
Welcome to our little country shack.
I came at the invitation of the King.
Your Majesty.
Are you all right?
Sorry, but I hate her.
Very nice to see you, Mrs Simpson.
Very nice.
Hello David.
You're making some changes to the garden, I see yes, I'm not quite finished yet.
Don't tell me I behaved badly, Mr Churchill.
On the contrary, your Royal Highness.
Etiquette decrees that royalty should be greeted by the official host.
In this case, the King.
Not a commoner.
Thank you.
What is her hold on him?
I have no idea.
Apparently she has certain skills, acquired in an establishment in Shanghai.
David.
Just be a sec, darling.
Excuse me.
David, I've been trying to see you.
I've been terribly busy.
Doing what?
Kinging.
Really?
Kinging is a precarious business these days.
Where's the Russian Tsar?
Where's cousin Wilhelm?
You're being dreary.
Is kinging laying off eighty staff and buying more pearls for Wallis while people are marching across Europe singing "The Red Flag"?
Stop your worrying.
Herr Hitler will sort them out.
And who'll sort out Herr Hitler?
Where's the bloody '23?
And you put that woman in our mother's suite?
Mother's not still in the bed, is she?
That's not funny.
Here it is.
Wallis likes the very best.
I don't care what woman you carry on with at night, as long as you show up for duty in the morning!
Wallis is not just some woman I am carrying on with.
We intend to marry.
Excuse me?
She's filing a petition for divorce.
Good God.
Can't you just give her a nice house and a title?
I'm not having her as my mistress.
The Church doesn't recognise divorce and you are the head of the Church.
Haven't I any rights?
Many privileges...
Not the same thing.
Your beloved common man may marry for love, why not me?
If you were a common man, on what basis could you possibly claim to be King?
Sounds like you've studied our wretched constitution.
Sounds like you haven't.
That's what this is all about?
Brushing up.
Hence the elocution lessons.
That's the scoop around town.
I'm trying to t-t...
Yearning for a larger audience are we, Buh-buh-buh-Bertie?
Don't...
What's that?
I'm sorry?
Younger brother trying to push older brother off the throne.
Po-po-positively medieval.
Wallis...
Where have you been all this time?
Who have you been talking to?
Never you mind.
Ahh..what a complicated lovely coon you are.
I try to be.
All that work, down the drain.
My own brother...
I couldn't say a single word to him in reply!
Why do you stammer so much more with David than you ever do with me?
Because you're bloody well paid to listen!
Bertie, I'm not a geisha girl.
Stop trying to be so bloody clever!
What is it about David that stops you speaking?
What is it about you that bloody well makes you want you to go on about it all the bloody time?
Vulgar but fluent.
You don't stammer when you swear.
Oh, bugger off!
Is that the best you can do?
Well, bloody bugger to you, you beastly bastard.
A public school prig can do better than that.
Shit!
Shit, shit, shit!
shit!
Yes, defecation flows trippingly from the tongue?
Because I'm angry!
Do you Know the F word?
Fornication?
Oh, Bertie.
Fuck.
Fuck, fuck, fuck!
Fucking bugger.
Buggedy, buggedy, buggedy, fuck, fuck, ass!
Yes!
You see!
Not a hesitation!
Shit fucking willy.
Willy, shit and fuck and... tits.
Dad?
What's going on?
Sorry.
Just finish your homework.
That's a side of you we don't get to see all that often.
No.
No we're not supposed to really, not publicly.
Let's get some air.
Logue, no, I don't think that's a good idea.
What's the matter?
Why are you so upset?
Logue, you have no idea.
My brother is infatuated with a woman who's been married twice.
She's asking for a divorce and he is determined to marry her.
Mrs Wallis Simpson of Baltimore.
That's not right.
Queen Wallis of Baltimore?
Unthinkable.
Can he do that?
Absolutely not.
But he's going to anyway.
All hell's broken loose.
Can't they just carry on privately?
If only they would.
Where does this leave you?
I know my place.
But I would do anything in my power to keep my brother on the throne.
Is it that serious?
Your place may well be on the throne.
I am not an alternative to my brother.
You can outshine David...
Don't take liberties!
That's bordering on treason.
I'm just saying you could be King.
You could do it!
That is treason!
I'm trying to get you to realize you needn't be governed by fear.
I've had enough of this!
What're you afraid of?
Your poisonous words!
Why did you come to me?
You are not some middle class bugger, who needs elocution lessons so you can chit-chat...
Don't instruct me on my duties!
I'm the son of a ....
King... the brother of a King.
You're the disappointing son of a brewer!
A jumped-up jackeroo from the outback!
You're nobody.
These sessions are over!
It's not because she's an American.
That is the least of it.
It's because she is a soon to be twice-divorced American, and the King, as head of The Church of England, cannot marry a divorced woman.
And Sir, I apologize for the nature of this, according to Scotland Yard, the King has not always possessed exclusive rights
to Mrs. Simpson's...
favors and affections... sharing them with a married used-car salesman.
a certain Mr Guy Trundle.
In addition, it is also rumored...
Hitler's ambassador, Count von Ribbentrop, sends her 17 carnations every day.
Should His Majesty continue to ignore the advice of His Government, he must abdicate.
Otherwise his Government has no choice but to resign.
Prime Minister, you'd leave the country without a government?
Does the King do what he wants?
Or does he do what his people expect him to do?
What's the matter, love?
I'm just having trouble with a patient.
That isn't like you.
Why?
He's scared.
He is afraid of his own shadow.
Isn't that why they come to you?
This fellow could really be somebody great.
He's fighting me.
Perhaps, he doesn't want to be great.
Perhaps that's what you want.
I might have overstepped the mark.
Apologize.
Do you both good.
I'm very sorry, Mr Logue.
The Duke is busy.
I'm happy to wait.
Or I could come back later.
As I said, the Duke is terribly busy.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Parliament will not support their marriage.
But there are other reasons for concern.
He was careless with state papers, he lacked commitment and resolve.
And there are those who are worried about where he will stand when war comes with Germany .
We're not coming to that?
Indeed we are, Sir.
Prime Minister Baldwin may deny this, but Hitler's intent is crystal clear.
War with Germany will come, and we will need a King whom we can all stand behind united.
I fear my brother is not of sound mind, at this time.
Have you thought what you will call yourself?
Certainly not Albert, Sir.
Too Germanic.
What about George?
After your father.
George the Sixth.
It has a rather nice continuity to it, don't you think?
David!
Thank God.
You look exhausted!
How are you bearing up?
Bertie, the decision's been made.
I'm going.
I can't accept that.
You are in no condition to make that decision.
I'm afraid there's no other way.
I must marry her.
My mind's made up.
I'm sorry.
That's a terrible thing to hear.
Nobody wants that.
I least of all.
At long last, I am able to say a few words of my own.
I have never wanted to withhold anything, but until now, it has not been constitutionally possible for me to speak.
A few hours ago I discharged my last duty as King and Emperor.
And now that I have been succeeded by my brother, the Duke of York my first words must be to declare my allegiance to him.
This I do with all my heart.
You all know the reasons which have impelled me to renounce the throne.
But you must believe me, when I tell you that I have found it impossible to carry the heavy burden of responsibility and to discharge my duties..
as King, as I would wish to do, without the help and support of the woman I love.
And I want you to know this decision has been made less difficult to me by the sure knowledge that my brother, with his long training in the public affairs of this country... and with his fine qualities will be able to take my place forthwith
without interruption or injury to the life and progress of the empire.
I meet you today... in circumstances which are
Thank you, darling.
Saddles, Margaret...
Oh, here's one.
Mama, here's a horse's saddle.
Thank you.
Oops.
Don't worry, you'll get yours back tomorrow.
Mama, will we have space for our horses in our new home?
Of course we will, darling, we'll have a palace of rooms.
Curtsey.
Your Majesty.
How was it?
I was trying to familiarize myself with what a State paper looks like.
A dispatch from Mr Baldwin which I don't understand a word of.
David's finances.
Christmas broadcast...
I think that would be a mistake.
No, don't worry about that.
Plans for the Coronation.
I think that would be an even bigger mistake.
I'm not a King.
I'm a naval officer.
That's all I know.
I'm not a King.
I'm not a King.
I'm sorry.
Oh, dear.
Dear, dear man...
You know, I refused your first two marriage proposals, not because I didn't love you, but because I couldn't bear the idea of a royal life.
Couldn't bear the idea of a life of tours and public duty,
A life that no longer was really to be my own.
But then I thought... he stammers so beautifully... they'll leave us alone.
Waiting for a king to apologize, one can wait rather a long wait.
I'm afraid we're slightly late.
This is home.
Myrtle's at bridge.
I've made sure the boys were out.
It's lovely.
Absolutely lovely.
Well, may I sit down?
Yes, of course.
Would you like some tea, Ma'am?
Yes.
I'll help myself.
Off you go.
Or must I knock your heads together?
Here's your shilling.
I understand... what you were trying to say, Logue.
I went about it the wrong way.
I'm sorry.
So, here I am.
Is the nation ready for two minutes of radio silence?
Every stammerer always fears going back to square one.
I don't let that happen.
If I fail in my duty...
David could come back.
I've seen the placards
"God Save Our King!"
They don't mean me.
Every monarch in history has succeeded someone who was dead, or just about to be.
My predecessor is not only alive, but very much so.
A bloody mess!
I can't even give them a Christmas Speech.
Like your Dad used to do?
Precisely.
He's not here anymore.
Yes he is.
He's on that shilling I gave you.
Easy enough to give away.
You don't have to carry him around in your pocket.
Or your brother.
You don't need to be afraid of the things you were afraid of when you were five.
You're very much your own man, Bertie.
Am I?
Your face is next, mate.
Lionel, dear?
Myrtle!
Is it all right?
Yes.
Bertie, come here.
Are you all right, Logue?
Yes.
Shall we go through?
Trust me.
It's important.
What is it?
You're...
You're...
It's "Your Majesty", the first time.
After that, it's "Ma'am," as in Ham, not "Mom" as in Palm.
I haven't told her about us.
Sit down, relax.
I'm told your husband calls my husband Bertie and my husband calls your husband Lionel.
I trust you won't call me Liz.
Your Majesty, you may call me Mrs Logue, Ma'am.
Very nice to meet you, Mrs Logue.
Logue, we can't stand here all day.
Yes we can.
Look, I need to wait for the right moment.
Logue, you're being a coward!
You're damn right.
Get out there, now!
Hello, Myrtle, darling!
You're early.
I believe you two have met!
But I don't think you know...
King George the Sixth.
It's very nice to meet you.
Will their Majesties be staying to dinner?
We'd love to, such a treat, but alas... a previous engagement.
What a pity.
Archbishop.
Welcome, your Majesty.
What a glorious transformation, Sir.
I hope you'll forgive us if we continue out preparations.
And now you will allow me to guide you through the ceremony.
We begin, of course, at the West door, then into the nave.
I see all your pronouncements are to be broadcast, Archbishop.
Ah, yes, wireless...
It is indeed a Pandora's Box.
And I'm afraid I've also had to permit the newsreel cameras.
The product of which I shall personally edit.
Without momentary hesitations.
This is Doctor Logue of Harley Street.
He's my speech therapist.
Your Grace.
Had I known that Your Majesty was seeking assistance
I should've made my own recommendation.
Dr. Logue... will be attending the Coronation.
Well, of course I shall speak with the Dean, but it will be extremely difficult.
I should like the Doctor to be seated in the King's Box.
But members of your family will be seated there, Sir.
That is why it is suitable.
And now, if you don't mind, Your Grace, we need the premises.
My dear fellow, this is Westminster Abbey!
The Church must prepare his Majesty.
My preparations are equally as important
With complete privacy, if you don't mind.
Those are my wishes, Your Grace.
I will place the Abbey at Your Majesty's disposal this evening.
Your Majesty.
I can't believe I'm walking on Chaucer, and Handel, and Dickens.
Everything all right?
Let's get cracking.
I'm not here to rehearse, Doctor Logue.
Call me Lionel.
True, you never called yourself "Doctor."
I did that for you.
No training, no diploma, no qualifications.
Just a great deal of nerve.
The Star Chamber inquisition, is it?
You asked for trust and total equality.
Bertie, I heard you at Wembley.
I was there.
My son Laurie said:
Dad, do you think you could help that poor man?
What, as a failed actor?
It's true, I'm not a doctor.
And yes, I acted a bit.
Well I recited in pubs and taught elocution in schools.
When the Great War came, all our Soldiers were returning to Australia from the front.
A lot of them shell-shocked, unable to speak.
Somebody said:
Lionel, you're very good at all this speech stuff.
Do you think you could possibly help these poor buggers?
I did muscle therapy, exercises, relaxation, but I knew I had to go deeper.
Those poor young blokes had cried out in fear, no one was listening to them.
My job was to give them faith in their own voice and let them know that a friend was listening.
That must ring a few bells with you, Bertie.
A very noble account of yourself.
Make inquiries.
It's all true.
Inquiries have been made.
You have no idea who I have breathing down my neck.
I vouched for you and you have no credentials.
But lots of success!
I can't show you a certificate.
There was no training then.
Everything I know I know from experience, and that war was some experience.
My plaque says, "L. Logue, Speech Defects."
No "Dr.".
There are no letters after my name.
Lock me in the Tower.
I would if I could!
On what charge?
Fraud!
With war looming, you've saddled this nation with a voiceless King.
You've destroyed the happiness of my family.
All for the sake of ensnaring a star... patient you couldn't possibly hope to assist!
It'll be like mad...
King George the Third, probably mad King George the stammerer, who let his people down so badly in their hour of need...
What're you doing?
Get up!
You can't sit there!
Get up!
Why not?
It's a chair.
No, that is not a chair, that is... that is...
That is Saint Edward's Chair!
People have carved their names on it.
That chair is the seat on which every King and Queen...
It's held in place by a large rock!
That is the Stone of Scone.
you are trivializing everything.
You believe such bollocks.
I don't care how many royal...
Listen to me.
Listen to me!
...arses have sat in this chair.
Listen to me!
Listen to you?
!
By what right?
By divine right, if you must!
I'm your King!
No you're not!
You told me so yourself.
You said you didn't want it.
Why should I waste my time listening to you?
Because I have a right to be heard!
Heard as what?
!
I have a voice!
Yes, you do.
You have such perseverance, Bertie.
You're the bravest man I know.
And you'll make a bloody good king.
What on earth's going on, Sir?
It's quite all right, Archbishop.
Mr Logue, you must know that I found a replacement English specialist with impecable credentials.
Hence, your services will no longer be required.
I'm sorry?
Your Majesty's function is to consult and be advised.
You didn't consult, but you have just been advised.
Now I advise you.
In this personal matter I will make my own decision.
My concern is for the head upon which I must place the crown.
I appreciate that Archbshop, but it's my head.
Your humble servant.
Thank you, Bertie.
Shall we rehearse?
Come on up on your perch.
Now when you and Elizabeth enter through the West door, you will be greeted by the hymn "I Was Glad When They Said Unto Me."
Actually you won't be that glad, because they do sing for a very long time.
Then your friend the Archbishop will pounce up the stairs towards you and say:
Sir, is Your Majesty willing to take The Oath?
I am willing.
Of course you are!
I'm going to see what this sounds like in the cheap seats so even your old nanny can hear.
Will you govern your peoples of Great Britain, Ireland, Canada,
Australia and New Zealand according to their lands and customs?
I solemnly promise so do so." Louder!
I can't hear you up the back.
I solemnly promise to do so!
Very good!
Will you to your power cause law and justice, in mercy, to be executed in all your judgments?
I will.
I will!
Then there's a very long bit about upholding the faith, goes on, rubbish, rubbish, rubbish.
To which you finally say...
The things which I have herebefore promised, I will perform and keep.
So help me God.
And that's all you'll say.
Four short responses, kiss the book, sign the oath, and you're King.
Easy.
You nearly crowned him backwards Archbishop!
Someone had removed the thread marking the back of the Crown, Sir.
Try not lose the thread, Archbishop.
Archbishop, we're missing Papa.
Very good, very good.
Archbishop.
Well, I hope Your Majesties are thrilled with the result.
You can switch that machine off now.
No, wait, keep going.
Do have a seat, Archbishop.
Meshes of uniformed men, stupefying to the eye and incredible to the imagination have stood in spellbound audience of the Führer.
Papa?
Mmm?
Papa, what's he saying?
I don't know, but he seems to be saying it rather well.
Sir, I have asked to see you today in order to tender my resignation as Prime Minister.
I'm so sorry to hear that, Mr Baldwin.
Neville Chamberlain will take my place as Prime Minister.
It's a matter of principal.
I was mistaken.
I have found it impossible to believe that there is any man in the World so lacking in moral feeling as Hitler.
That the world may be hurled for a second time into the abyss of destructive war.
Churchill was right all along.
This was always Hitler's intention.
I'm really very sorry to leave you at this great time of crisis.
I'm very much afraid, Sir, that your greatest test is yet to come.
I am speaking to you from the cabinet room at 10 Downing Street.
This morning the British Ambassador in Berlin handed the German Government a final note
stating that unless we heard from them by 11 o'clock that they were prepared at once to withdraw their troops from Poland, a state of war would exist between us.
I have to tell you now that no such undertaking has been received, and that consequently this country is at war with Germany.
At last Sir, here is your speech.
You are on air at six.
I've timed it to just under nine minutes.
The wording is fully approved.
The Prime Minister will be joining you for the broadcast which will go out live across the Nation, the Empire and to our Armed Forces.
Get Logue here immediately.
There's the barrage balloons.
Yes.
They got them up there quickly.
Yeah.
Should we pull over and find shelter?
No, go straight there.
We'll be all right
Yes.
Sir?
Lionel Logue.
Major Hartley's expecting me.
This is my son Laurie.
Thank you, Laurie.
Good luck, Dad.
The King's Speech.
Thank you, Sir.
You have about forty minutes until the broadcast.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
There may be dark days ahead, and...
Try again.
There may be dark days ahead, and...
Turn the hesitations into pauses, and say to yourself, "God save the King".
I say that continuously, but apparently no one's listening.
Long pauses are good: they add solemnity to great occasions.
Then I'm the solemnest king who ever lived.
You know, if I'm a King...
where's my power?
Can I...
Can I form a Government?
Can I...
Can I levy a tax or declare a war?
No!
And yet I'm the seat of all authority.
Why?
Because the Nation believes that when I speak, I speak for them.
But I can't speak!
Let's take it all again from the top.
In this grave hour...
In this grave hour, fuck-fuck-fuck perhaps the most fateful in our history, bugger-shit-shit
I send to every household of my...
You see, "P" is always difficult, even when I'm singing.
Bounce onto it: "a-peoples", not "people".
a-people household of my...
a-peoples both at home and overseas...
Beautiful.
...this message, doo-dah, spoken with the same depth of feeling, doo-dah-dey, ...for each one of you as if I were able to shit-fuck-bugger to cross your threshold and speak to you
In your head, now:
I have a right to be bloody well heard!
Bloody well heard, bloody well heard, bloody well heard myself!
Now, waltz.
Move!
Get continuous movement.
For the second time in the lives of most of us we are at... we are...
Take a pause.
Lionel, I can't do this.
Bertie, you can do it.
Have a look at the last paragraph.
Bertie, it's time.
There he is.
Archbishop.
Your Majesty.
A great moment, Sir.
Prime Minister.
Your Majesty.
Nice to see you again, so soon.
Good of you to be here.
I'm sure you've had a rather busy day.
We hope we have no more interruptions from those damned sirens, Sir.
Or the wretched dogs.
Congratulations, First Lord of the Admiralty.
Your Majesty.
The long walk.
Good luck, Sir.
I too dread this apparatus.
Had a speech impediment myself, you know.
I didn't.
Family secret.
Tongue-tied.
An operation was considered to be too dangerous.
I eventually made an asset of it.
Thank you, Mr Churchill.
Sir.
Darling.
How long, Logue?
Just under three minutes, Sir.
Five seconds, Sir.
5, 4, 3 , 2 , 1.
Mr Wood.
Good luck, Your Majesty.
Mr Wood.
You've redecorated, Logue.
I made it cozy.
Some fresh air.
There you are, Darling.
I'm thistle sifter, I've a sieve of sifted thistles and a sieve on unsifted thistles.
I've a sieve of sifted thistles and a sieve on unsifted thistles, because I'm...
Bertie, darling, be sure it's not switched on!
Remember the red light will blink four times and I've asked them to turn it off, because we don't want that evil eye staring at you all the way through.
One minute, sir.
I'm sure you will be splendid.
Forty seconds, Sir.
Logue, however this turns out,
I don't know how to thank you for what you've done.
Knighthood?
Twenty seconds.
Forget everything else and just say it to me.
Say it to me, as a friend.
In this grave hour,
(Breathe)
perhaps the most fateful in our history,
I send to every household of my... peoples, a-peoples... both at home
and overseas
this message spoken with the same depth of feeling
for each one of you as if I were able to cross your threshold
and speak to you myself.
For the second time in the lives of most of us we are at... at war.
(Fuck-fuck-fuck) ... at war.
Over and over again we have tried to find
a peaceful way out of the differences between ourselves and those who are now our enemies.
But it has been in vain.
We have been forced into a conflict.
For we are called, to meet the challenge of a principle which, if it were to prevail, would be fatal to any civilized order
in the world.
Such a principle, stripped of all disguise,
is surely the mere
primitive doctrine that might is right.
For the sake of all that we ourselves hold dear, it is unthinkable that we should refuse to meet the challenge.
It is to this high purpose that I now call my people at home and my peoples across the seas, who will make our cause their own.
I ask them to stand calm and firm, and united in this time of trial
the task will be hard.
There may be dark days ahead, and war can no longer be confined to the battlefield.
But we can only do the right as we see the right and reverently commit our cause to God.
If one and all we keep resolutely faithful to it, then, with God's help,
we shall prevail.
That was very good, Bertie.
You still stammered on the "w".
I had to throw in a few so they knew it was me.
Congratulations, your Majesty.
A true broadcaster.
Thank you, Mr Wood.
Congratulations, your Majesty.
Congratulations, your Majesty.
Thank you.
Ready.
Good?
Perfect.
Your first wartime speech.
Congratulations.
Expect I shall have to do a great deal more.
Thank you, Logue.
Well done, my friend.
Thank you, Your Majesty.
I knew you'd be good.
Thank you, Lionel.
Onwards?
Congratulations, Sir.
Wouldn't have said it better myself, Sir.
Your Majesty, I am speechless.
Congratulations, Sir.
Gentlemen.
Congratulations, your Majesty.
So how was Papa, Elizabeth?
Halting at first, but you got much better, Papa.
Bless you.
And how about you, Margaret?
You were just splendid, Papa.
Of course I was.
We all ready?
Come on girls.
Subtitles:
Luís Filipe Bernardes
You are live in two minutes, Your Royal Highness.
Sir?
At the microphone, Do your work Sir.
I am sure you will be splendid.
Just take your time.
Time to go.
Good afternoon.
This is the BBC National Programme and Empire Services taking you to Wembley Stadium for the Closing Ceremony of the Empire Exhibition.
where His Royal Highness the
Duke of York will read a message from his Father;
His Majesty, King George V.
58 British Colonies and Dominions have taken part, making this the largest Exhibition staged anywhere in the world.
Remember Sir, Three flashes;
then steady 'red' means you are Live.
Using the new invention of radio,
The Opening Ceremony was the first time... his Majesty the King addressed his subjects on the wireless.
At the close of the first Season,
The heir to the throne His Royal Highness... the Prince of Wales, made his first broadcast.
And today, his younger brother His Royal Highness, the Duke of York will give his inaugural broadcast to the Nation and the World.
I have received... from his Majesty the...
The King...
Inhale deep into your lungs...
Your Royal Highness.
Relaxes your larynx, does it not?
Cigarette smoking calms the nerves and gives you confidence.
Now, if Your Highness will be so kind as to open your hand.
It's Sterilized.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
Now, if I may take the liberty, insert them into your mouth.
Excuse me, Doctor.
What is the purpose of this?
It is the classic approach, it cured Demosthenes.
That was in Ancient Greece.
Has it worked since?
Now, if you would be so kind as to read.
"A wealth of words."
Fight against those marbles, Your Royal Highness.
Enunciate!
A little more concentration your Royal Higness.
I nearly swallowed the bloody things!
Thank you so much, Doctor, it's been most, hmm... interesting.
Your highness.
Insert... marbles!
He can insert his own bloody marbles.
Tick, tock.
Tick, tock.
You know, you can't keep doing this, Bertie.
I know.
Promise me.
Promise me, no more.
Hello.
Is anyone there?
I'm just in the loo.
Ah, Mrs.Johnson, there you are.
I'm sorry, there's no receptionist.
I like to keep things simple.
"Poor and content is rich and rich enough."
- I'm Sorry?
- Shakespeare.
How are you?
How do you do?
Oh, chuffing along.
Um, now, this is slightly awkward, but I'm afraid you're late.
Yes, I'm afraid I am.
Where's Mr Johnson?
Ah...
He doesn't know I'm here.
That's not a promising start.
No.
No, look, my husband has seen everyone to no avail.
Awefully 'fraid he's given up hope.
He hasn't seen me.
You're awfully sure of yourself.
Well, I'm sure of anyone who wants to be cured.
Of course, he wishes to be cured.
My husband is um...
Well, he's required to speak publicly.
Perhaps he should change jobs?
He can't.
Indentured servitude?
Something of that nature.
Yes.
Well we need to have your hubby pop by.
Uh..
Tuesday would be good...
He can give me his personal details and I'll make a frank appraisal and then, We can take it from there.
Doctor, forgive me.
I do not have a hubby.
We don't pop.
And nor do we ever talk about our private lives.
You... must come to us.
I'm Sorry, Mrs Johnson, my game, my turf, my rules.
You'll have to talk over this with your husband and then you can speak to me on the telephone.
Thank you very much for dropping by...
Good afternoon.
And what if my husband were the Duke of York?
The Duke of York?
Yes... the Duke of York.
I thought the appointment was for Johnson?
Forgive me, your ...?
Royal Highness.
Johnson was used during the Great War;
when the Navy didn't want the enemy to know he was aboard.
Am I...considered the enemy?
You will be, if you remain unobliging.
And you have to have abosolute descretion.
Of course.
How did you find me, Your Royal Highness?
The President of society of the Speech Therapists.
Eileen McCleod?
She's a sport.
Dr McCleod warned me your antipodean methods were unorthodox and controversial.
I warned her... those were not my favorite words.
I can cure your husband.
But for my method to work I need trust and total equality;
Here, in the safety of my consultation room.
No exceptions.
Well then, in that case...
When can you start?
Still sounds a bit rough, mate.
You make me drive too slowly, Dad!
Did you pick mum up from bridge?
Yes, I've hardly been out of the car all day.
I had a special visitor this afternoon.
- May I please leave this table.
- How special, special?
No, You must stay, bored stupid, listening to your parents'inane conversation.
- Thanks Dad..
- and Mum.
And mom.
- Me too.
- You meeting Jean?
No, someone else.
Doctor?
Doctor?
Can't you help your brother with the washing...
I'm fine.
Who's it Lionel?
Why bring it up if you can't talk about it?
Myrtle, It's just a woman, looking to help her husband.
Oh!
And I had a call.
For an audition.
- One of my favorites.
- Aren't they all?
It could be a lot of fun.
I'm sure you'll be splendid.
They're a highly regarded group.
From Putney.
Tomorrow, Chapter IV.
The flight
- Mama, I don't know they fly at all.
- I can't wait
Oh, to fly away
Weren't they lucky!
Now Papa tell a story!
Could I be a penguin instead?
Well, now I want a penguin story.
Very quickly.
Once, there were two princesses.
Princess Elizabeth and Princess Margaret.
whose Papa was a penguin.
This was because he had been turned into one by the wicket witch.
This was an inconvenient for him.
Because he loved to hold his princesses in his arms... and penguin can't because he has wings like herrings.
Herrings don't have wings.
Penguins have wings which is shaped like herrings... and make matters worse... is that she sent him to the South Pole.
which is an awfully long walk back.
if you can't fly.
So...
When he reached the water, he dived in through the dept so fast... that he was in Southampton waters by lunchtime.
And from there, he took the 2:30 to Weybridge, changed at Clapham Junction and... asked a passing mallard the way to Buckingham Palace.
He swam up the Thames, out through the plughole, and gave the cook,
Mama and Mrs Whittaker quite a shock.
Now when the girls heard all the commotions, they ran to the kitchen where they gave him a good scrub, a mackerel and a kiss.
and as they kissed him, guess what he turned into?
A handsome prince.
A short-tailed Albatross.
With wings so big... that he could wrap them both his two girls together.
Now, now...
It's time for bed.
Come on.
Take these horses to stable.
- Quickly now, you have exactly a minute.
- Good night.
Feed them, bath them and to bed.
Will Mrs Simpson be there?
My brother's insisting.
Is he serious?
About her coming to dinner?
No, about her.
A married woman?
He can't be.
She can.
By the way, I think I found someone rather interesting.
On Harley Street.
A doctor.
Out of the question.
I'm not having this conversation again.
The matter's settled.
His approach seems rather different....
Now?
Now.
"Now is the winter of our discontent,
Made glorious summer by this sun of York.
And all the clouds that lour'd upon our house
In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.
Now are our brows, bound with victorious... wreaths."
Thank you!
Lovely diction Mr...?
Logue.
Lionel Logue.
Well, Mr.Logue.
I'm not hearing the cries of a deformed creature yearning to be King.
Nor did I realize Richard III was King of the Colonies.
I do know all the lines.
I've played the role before.
- Sydney?
- Perth.
Major theater town, is it?
Enthusiastic.
I was well reviewed.
Yes... well, Lionel,
I think our dramatic society, is looking for someone slightly younger and a... little more regal.
You have to shut that one first.
Put that one forth.
Excellent.
Where did you find this... physician?
Classifieds, next to 'French model, Shepherd's Market'.
He comes highly recommended.
Charges substantial fees in order to help the poor.
Oh dear, perhaps he's a Bolshevik?
!
Ah, there's no receptionist.
Likes to keep things simple.
Uh...
The Johnsons.
You can go in now, Mr. Johnson.
Lionel says... wait here if you wish, Mrs Johnson.
Or, it being a... pleasant day... perhaps take a stroll.
Was that alright...
Lionel?
Marvellous!
Willy.
You can stay and wait for your mom.
Mrs Johnson...
Mr Johnson, Do you come in?
Would you like a sweetie?
He's a good lad, Willy.
He could hardly make a sound, you know, when he first came to me.
My boys made those.
They're good, aren't they?
Please make yourself comfortable.
I was told not to sit too close.
Well I believe when speaking with a prince,
One waits for the prince to choose a topic.
Waiting for me to... commence a conversation, one can wait a rather long wait.
Ah, yes, well...
Do you know any jokes?
Timing isn't my strong suit.
Cup of tea?
No thank you.
I think I'll have one.
Aren't you going to start treating me, Dr Logue?
Only if you're interested in being treated.
Please, call me Lionel.
I prefer Doctor.
I prefer Lionel.
- What will I call you?
- Your Royal Highness.
Then... it's "sir" after that.
A little bit formal for here.
I prefer names.
Prince Albert Frederick Arthur George.
How about Bertie?
- Only my family uses that.
- Perfect.
In here, it's better if we're equals.
If... if we were equals, I wouldn't be here.
I'd be... at home with my wife and no one would give a damn.
Please, Don't do that.
I'm sorry?
I believe, sucking smoke into your lungs will kill you.
My physicians say it relaxes the... the throat.
- They're idiots.
- They've all been knighted.
Makes it official then.
My castle, my rules.
Thank you.
What was your earliest memory?
What on earth do you mean?
Your first recollection.
I'm not... here to discuss my personal matters.
Why're you here then?
Because I am bloody well stammer!
You have a bit of a temper?
One of my many faults.
When did the defect start?
I've always been this way!
I doubt that.
Don't tell me!
It's my stammer!
It's my field.
I can assure you, no infant starts to speak with a stammer.
When did yours start?
Four or five.
That's typical.
So I've been told.
I can't remember not doing it.
I can believe that.
Do you hesitate when you think?
Don't be ridiculous.
How about when you talk to yourself?
Everyone natters to themselves occasionally, Bertie.
Stop... stop calling me that.
I'm not going to call you anything else.
Then we shan't speak!
Are you charging for this, Doctor?
A fortune.
I'll just let that brew.
So... when you talk to yourself, do you stammer?
No... of course not!
Well, that proves your impediment isn't a permanent part of you.
What do you think was the cause?
I don't... don't know.
I...
I don't...
I don't care!
I...
I stammer!
And no one can fix it.
I bet you, you can read flawlessly, right here, right now.
And if I win the bet, I get to ask you more questions.
- And if I win?
- You don't have to answer.
One usually... wagers money.
A bob each to keep it sweet?
- Let's see your shilling.
- I don't... carry money.
I had a funny feeling you mightn't.
I'll stake you.
And you can pay me back next time.
Who says there is a next time?
I haven't agreed to take you on, yet.
Please stand.
And take a look at that.
I can't...
I can't read this.
Well, then you owe me a shilling, for not trying.
To be... or not to be, that...
I can't read!
I haven't finished yet.
I'm going to record your voice and then play it back to you on the same machine.
This is brilliant.
It's the latest thing from America.
It's a Silvertone.
Pop this on?
There's a bob in this, mate.
You can go home rich!
- You're playing music.
- I know.
So how can I hear what I'm saying?
Surely a Prince's brain knows what its mouth is doing.
You're not well acquainted with Royal Princes, are you?
Hopeless.
Hopeless!
You were sublime.
Would I lie to a prince of the realm to win twelve pence?
I've no idea... what an Australian might do for that sort of money.
Let me play it back to you.
No.
All right then, I get to ask you the question.
Thank you, Doctor,
I don't feel... this is for me.
Thank You for your time, Bye.
Sir?
The recording is free.
Please keep it as a souvenir.
No.
For the present, the work to which we are all equally bound, is to arrive at a reasoned tranquillity within our borders, to regain prosperity at this time of depression, without self-seeking... and to carry with us those whom the burden of past years... has disheartened or overborne.
To all, to each, I wish a Happy Christmas.
God bless you.
And off air.
Easy when you know how.
Sir.
Have a go yourself.
- Congratulations, Sir.
- Mr. Wood.
Splendid fellow.
Chap taught me everything I know.
Let the microphone do the work.
- Sir.
- Thank you.
Gentlemen.
Sit up, straight back, face boldly up to the bloody thing and stare it square in the eye, as you would any decent Englishman.
Show who's in command.
Papa, I don't think I can read this.
This devilish device will change everything if you don't.
In the past all a King had to do was look respectable in uniform and not fall off his horse.
Now, we must invade people's homes... and ingratiate ourselves with them.
This family's been reduced to those lowest, basest of all creatures.
We've become actors!
We're not a family, we're a firm.
Yet at any moment, some of us may be out of work.
Your darling brother, and future king!
The only wife he appears interested in is invariably the wife of another!
He's broken off with Lady Furness.
And taken up a Mrs. Simpson, a woman with two husbands living!
I told him straight, no divorced person could ever be received at court.
He said it made him sublimely happy.
I imagined that was because she was sleeping with him.
"I give you my word," this is what he said.
"I give you my word we've never had immoral relations."
stared square into his father's face and lied!
When I'm dead, that boy will ruin himself, this family and this nation within twelve months.
Who'll pick up the pieces, hmm?
Herr Hitler intimidating half of Europe.
Marshall Stalin the other half.
Who'll stand between us, the jackboots, and the proletarian abyss?
You?
Well, with your older brother shirking his duties, you're going to have to do a lot more of this.
Have a go yourself.
- With the wireless...
- Get it out, boy!
- one of the... marvels of...
- Modern.
Just take your time, form your words carefully.
- science, I am enabled...
- Relax!
- Just try it!
- This Chrismas Day... to speak to all my...
Do it!
Lying .. bastard.
- "You're playing music.
- I know.
So how can I hear what I'm saying?
Surely a Prince's brain knows what its mouth is doing?
You're not well acquainted with Royal Princes, are you?
To be, or not to be, that is the question.
whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer... the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, or to take arms against a sea of troubles, and by opposing end them?
To die, to sleep no more, and by a sleep to say we end... is the heartache and the thousand natural shocks... that flesh is heir to.
Tis a consummation...
Hopeless.
Hopeless!"
Strictly business.
No... personal nonsense.
I thought I'd made that very clear in our interview.
Have you got the shilling you owe me?
No, I haven't.
Didn't think so.
Besides, you tricked me!
Physical excercises and tricks are important...
What you're asking will only deal with the surface of the problem.
Is that effecient?
No, as far as I see it, my husband has mechanical difficulties with his speech.
Maybe just deal with that.
I'm willing to work hard, Doctor Logue.
Lionel.
Are you... are you willing to do your part?
Alright.
You want mechanics?
We need to relax your jaw muscles and strengthen your tongue by repeating tongue twisters
For example, "I'm a thistle-sifter.
I have a sieve of sifted thistles and... a sieve of unsifted thistles because I am a thistle-sifter.
Fine!
You do have a flabby tummys, we need spend some times to strength in your diaphragm.
Simple mechanics.
That is all we ask.
And that's about a shilling's worth.
Forget about the bloody shilling!
Perhaps, upon occasions... you might be requested to assist... in coping with... some minor event.
Will that be agreeable?
Of course.
Yes.
And that will be the full extent of your services.
Shall I see you next week?
I shall see you every day.
Feel the loosening of the jaw.
Good.
Little bounces, bounces.
Shoulders loose.
Now lips.
Take a nice deep breath.
Expand your chest..
put your hands on your ribs.
Deeper, good.
How do you feel?
Full of hot air.
Isn't that what public speaking is all about?
My wife and I are glad to visit this important...
Take a good deep breath, and up comes Her Royal Highness and slowly exhale, and down comes Her Royal Highness.
- You alright, Bertie?
- Yes.
This is actually quite good fun.
- Mmm... mother.
- Shorter time each time.
- Mmm...mother.
- Mmm... manufactoring district.
- Another deep breathe...
- Jack and Jill...
- Jack and Jill...
- went up the hill.
- went up the hill.
Now just sway.
Perfect.
We'll not permit us to...
- Loosen the shoulders.
- Ding dong bell, which is in the well... who put any little ton in ten...
Still short memory, Bertie, come on.
- A cow.
- A cow.
- A king.
- A king.
Anyone who can shout vows in a open window can learn to deliver a speech.
Fourty... fifty!
- Take a deep breath, and...
- It is...
- Let the words flow.
- Knight as a bloody wack...
Come on.
One more time, Bertie, do it!
a sieve of sifted thistles...
- Father.
Father.
- F... father.
Father.
- Name of the "th", father.
- Father.
F... father.
Father.
- Hello, Bertie.
- Hello David.
- How did you come out.
- Not at all.
You waiting long?
Christ, it's bloody freezing.
Where've you been?
- I've Been busy.
- So was I.
Elizabeth has pneumonia.
I'm sorry.
She'll recover.
Father won't.
I'll drive.
Old bugger's doing this on purpose.
Dying?
Departing prematurely... to complicate matters with Wallis.
For heaven's sake, David.
You know how long he's been ill.
Wallis explained.
She's terribly clever about these things.
Whereas by letters patent under the Great Seal, bearing date of Westminster, the eleventh June, 1912
His Majesty King George the Fifth did constitute...
- order and declare that there should be a guardian,
-What's going on here.
- Custos Regni...
- I cannot follow you.
I'm confused that and...
- in the form of council of state.
- I don't understand what you are talking about...
It's the order of the Council for the State, Sir.
So we may act on your behalf... talk clearer to me, I'm afraid...
- I'm so confused but...
- Approved.
Thank you.
Give me your hand, sir.
Thank you.
Feeling a little better, Sir?
No.
I'm not feeling any better.
I feel dreadful.
Been, Uh, ice skating?
Ice skating?
No, no, George.
Yes, yes, he's alright, of course.
I know, darling, a talk, even a lovely long talk, is a poor substitute for holding tight and making drowsy.
Nor making our own drowsies either, as we've had to do far too often lately.
David, dinner?
I'm on with Wallis!
Bertie.
No.
No, it's not important.
I don't want to!
No!
I'll phone you later.
Bye, bye.
Wallis misses me terribly.
Mama says you're late for dinner.
She forgets
Papa's bloody clocks were always half an hour fast.
How is the King?
I hope he is not in pain.
No, no, sir.
His Majesty is quieter now.
Thank you.
David, if your father were here, tardiness would not be tolerated.
None of this unpleasantness would be tolerated.
You know sir, I appreciate that you are different from your father both in outlook and temperament.
I want you to know that... whenever the King questioned your conduct,
I tried in your interest, to present it in a most favourable light.
I can always trust you to have my best interests at heart.
I fear, our vigil will not be of long duration.
Please continue.
We commend our brother George... to the mercy of God, our Maker and Redeemer.
Long live the King.
I hope, I will make good as he has made good.
What on earth was that?
Poor Wallis.
Now I'm trapped!
Time for a Shake, dad?
You sure?
Go on.
Put your thinking caps on.
Bet its the Scottish Play.
No, I bet it's Othello.
It's always Othello.
Are thou afeard.
Be not afeard.
Caliban!
Oh!
For heaven's sake...
that was a lucky guess!
Don't listen to egghead.
Go on, Dad.
The isle is full of noises, sounds and sweet airs, that give delight, and hurt not.
Sometimes a thousand twanging instruments... will hum about mine ears, and sometimes voices, that, if then...
I had waked after long sleep will make me sleep again.
Alright, clever clogs, what comes next?
And then, in dreaming, the clouds methought would open, and show riches ready to drop upon me... that when I'm awaked, I cried to dream again.
It's such a sad thought.
My next patient must be early.
You better go lads, I'm sorry.
Won't be a moment, Clifford.
Bertie!
They told me not to expect you.
I am sorry about your father.
I don't wish to intrude.
Oh no...
Please come in.
I've been practising.
One hour a day.
In spite of everything.
What's going on there?
I was, sorry, mucking around with my kids.
Do you feel like working today?
A Curtis bi-plane.
I'll put on some hot milk.
Logue, I'd kill for something stronger.
I wasn't there for my father's death.
Still makes me sad.
I can imagine so.
What did you father do?
He was a brewer.
At least there was free beer.
Here's to the memory of your father.
I was informed, after the fact... that my father's last words were,
Bertie has more guts than the rest of his brothers put together.
He couldn't say that to my face.
My brother.
What about him?
Try singing it.
I'm sorry.
What songs do you know?
Songs?
Yes, songs.
"Swanee River"?
I love that song.
Happens to be my favorite.
Sing me the chorus.
No.
Certainly not.
Always wanted to build models.
Father... father wouldn't allow it.
He collected stamps.
So we had to collect stamps.
You can finish that off.
If you sing.
My brother David.
Dum, dum, dum-dum...
I'm not going to sit here, wobbling.
You can with me.
Because you're peculiar.
I take that as a compliment.
Rules are rules.
I'm not crooning "Swanee River".
"Camptown Races" then.
My brother David, he said to me, doo-dah doo-dah...
Continuous sound will give you flow.
Does it feel strange, now that David's on the throne?
To tell the truth, it was a relief... knowing I wouldn't be...
King.
But unless he produces an heir, you're next in line.
And your daughter, Elizabeth, would then succeed you.
You're barking up the wrong tree now, Doctor, Doctor.
Lionel See?
You didn'stammer.
Of course I didn't stammer, I was singing!
Well, as a little reward, you get to put some glue on these struts.
Your boy, won't mind?
No, not at all.
David and I were very close.
Young bucks...
You know.
Did you chase the same girls?
David was always very helpful in arranging introductions.
We shared the expert ministrations of Paulette in Paris.
Not at the same time of course.
Did David ever tease you?
Yes, they all did.
Buh-buh-buh-Bertie?
Father encouraged it.
Said,"Get it out, boy!" Said it would make me stop.
Said that "I sas afraid of my father, and my children are damn well going to be afraid of me."
Are you naturally right handed?
Left.
I was... punished.
Now I use the right.
Yes, that's very common with stammerers.
Anything other corrections?
Knock knees.
Metal splints were made.
Worn... worn day and night.
- That must have been painful.
- Bloody agony.
Straight legs now.
Who were you closest to in your family?
Nannies.
Not my first nanny.
She loved David... hated me.
When we are presented to my... parents for the daily viewing,
she'd pinch me..
I'd cry and be handed back to her immediately.
And then she would...
Sing it.
"Then she wouldn't feed me.
Far far away."
Took my parents...
three years to notice.
As you can imagine, it caused some stomach problems.
Still.
What about your brother, Johnny?
Were you close to him?
Johnny.
Sweet boy.
Had... epilepsy.
And he was... different.
He died at... 13.
hidden from view.
I'm...
I'm told it's not... catching.
Do you want a top-up?
Please.
You know...
Lionel, you're... you're the first ordinary Englishman...
Australian.
I've ever really spoken to.
When I'm... driven through the streets and see the, you know, the common man staring at me,
I'm struck by how little I know of his life, and how little he knows of mine.
Thank you.
What're friends for.
I wouldn't know.
I sifted seven... thick-stalked thistles trough a strong, thick sieve.
I sifted seven thick-stalked...
That's enough now, darling.
I have to keep doing this, it's awful.
I sifted seven...
thick-stalked...
- Oh, no.
One hundred year old spruces...
removed to improve the view!
Who does she think she is!
Nonetheless... we must try to be pleasant towards Mrs Simpson.
You know she calls me the Fat Scottish Cook?
You're not fat.
I'm getting plump.
You seldom cook.
I sifted seven...
- Shut up!
trough a strong... thick sieves...
I sifted seven...
Their Royal Highnesses the Duke and Duchess of York.
How lovely to see you both.
Welcome to our little country shack.
I came at the invitation of the King.
Your Majesty.
- You all right?
- Sorry we're late.
Very nice to see you.
Mrs. Simpson.
Very nice.
Hello David.
Making some... changes to the garden, I see.
Yes, I am not quite finished yet.
Don't tell me I behaved badly, Mr Churchill.
On the contrary, your Royal Highness.
Etiquette decrees royalty must be greeted by the official host, in this case, the King.
Not a commoner.
Thank you.
What is her hold on him?
I have no idea.
Apparently she has certain skills... acquired in an establishment in Shanghai.
David.
Just be a sec, darling.
Would you excuse me?
David, I've been trying to see you...
I've been terribly busy.
Doing what?
- Kinging.
- Really?
Kinging... is a precarious business these days.
Where is the Russian Tsar?
Where is Cousin Wilhelm?
You're being dreary.
Is Kinging laying off 80... staff and buying more pearls for Wallis while people are marching across Europe singing the Red Flag?
Stop your worrying.
Herr Hitler will sort them out.
And who'll sort out Herr Hitler?
Where's the bloody '23?
And you've put that woman into our mother's suite?
Mother's not still in the bed, is she?
That's not funny.
Here it is.
Wallis likes the very best.
I don't care what woman you carry on with at night, as long as you show up for duty in the morning!
Wallis is not just some woman I am carrying on with.
We intend to marry.
Excuse me?
She's filing a petition for divorce.
Good God.
Can't you just give her a nice house and a title?
I'm not having her as my mistress.
The Church doesn't recognize divorce, and you are the... head of the Church.
Haven't I any rights?
Many privileges...
Not the same thing.
Your beloved common man may marry for love, why not me?
If you were... a common man, on what basis could you...
possibly claim to be King?
Sounds like you've studied our wretched Constitution.
Sounds like you haven't.
That's what this is about.
Brushing up.
Hence, the elocution lessons?
That's the scoop around town.
I'm trying to...
Yearning for a larger audience are we, B-B-B-B-Bertie?
Don't...
What's that?
I'm sorry, I...
Younger brother trying to push older brother off the throne..
P-P-P-P-Positively medieval.
Wallis.
Ah.
Where have you been all this time?
- Who have you been talking to?
- Never you mind.
What a very complicated little King you are.
I try to be.
All that work... down the drain.
My own brother...
I couldn't say a single word to him in reply.
Why do you stammer so much more with David than you ever do with me?
Because you're bloody well paid to listen!
Bertie, I'm not a geisha girl.
Stop trying to be so bloody clever!
What is it about David that stops you speaking?
What is it about you that bloody well makes... you want to go on about him, the whole bloody time.
Vulgar but fluent.
You don't stammer when you swear.
Bugger off!
Is that the best you can do?
Well, bloody bugger to you, you beastly bastard.
A public school prig can do better than that.
Shit!
Shit, shit, shit.
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.
Shit!
Shit!
- Yes!
See how defecation flows trippingly from the tongue?
Because I'm angry!
You Know the f-word?
Fornication?
Oh Bertie.
Fuck.
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fucking fuck!
Fuck, fuck and bugger!
Bugger, bugger, buggedy, buggedy.
Buggedy, fuck, fuck, ass
- Yes!
You see!
Not a hesitation!
- Balls, balls, fuckety shit, shit,
Willy, shit and fuck!
And tits.
Dad?
What's going on?
Sorry.
Finish your homework
Well...
That's a side of you we don't get to see that often.
No.
No we're not supposed to really, not publicly.
Let's get some air.
No, Logue, I don't think that's a good idea.
What's the matter?
What's got you so upset?
Logue, you have no idea.
My brother is infatuated with a woman who's been married twice.
She's asking for a divorce and David is determined to marry her.
Mrs. Wallis Simpson of Baltimore.
That's not right.
Queen Wallis of Baltimore?
Unthinkable.
Can he do that?
Absolutely not.
But he's going to anyway.
All hell's broken loose.
Can't they carry on privately?
If only they would.
Where does that leave you?
I know my place.
I'll do anything... in my power to keep my brother on the throne.
Is it that serious?
Your place may well be on the throne.
I am not an alternative to my brother.
You can outshine David.
Don't take liberties!
That's bordering on treason.
I'm just saying you could be King.
You could do it!
That is treason!
I'm trying to get you to realise...
- you need not be governed by fear.
- I've had enough of this!
What're you so afraid of?
Your poisonous words!
Why'd you come to me?
You are not some middle class bugger, who needs elocution lessons so you can chit-chat...
Don't instruct me on my duties!
I'm the son of a....
King.
The brother of a king.
You're the disappointing son of a brewer!
A jumped-up jackeroo from the outback!
You're nobody.
These sessions are over!
It's not because she's an American.
That is the least of it.
It's because she is a soon to be a twice divorced American,
And the King, as head of The Church of England... can not marry a divorced woman.
And Sir, I apologize for the nature of this.
According to Scotland Yard, the King has not always possess exclusive rights to Mrs. Simpson's favours and affections,
sharing them with a married used car salesman, a certain Mr Guy Trundle.
In addition, it is also rumoured...
Hitler's ambassador, Count von Ribbentrop, sends her 17 carnations every day.
Should His Majesty continue to ignore the advice of His Government, he must abdicate.
Otherwise His Government has no choice but to resign.
Prime Minister, you'd leave the country without a... a government?
Does the King do what he wants, or does he do what his people expect him to do?
What's the matter, love?
I'm Just having trouble with a patient.
That isn't like you..
Why?
He's scared...
H's afraid of his own shadow.
Isn't that why they come to you?
This fellow could be really somebody great, and he's fighting me.
Perhaps, he doesn't want to be great.
Perhaps that's what you want.
I might have overstepped the mark.
Apologize, do you both good.
I'm very sorry, Mr Logue, the Duke is busy.
I'm happy to wait.
Or I could come back later.
As I said, the Duke is terribly busy.
Thank you.
The parliament will not support their marriage.
But there were other reasons for concern.
He was careless with state papers.
He lacked commitment and resolve.
There were those that worried where he would stand when war comes with Germany .
We're not coming to that?
Indeed we are, Sir.
Prime Minister Baldwin may deny this, but Hitler's intent is crystal clear.
War with Germany will come, and we will need a King behind whom we can all stand behind, united.
I fear my... brother is not of... sound mind, at this time.
Have you thought what you will call yourself?
Certainly not Albert, Sir.
Too Germanic.
What about George?
After your father?
George the sixth.
It has rather a nice continuity to it, don't you think?
David!
Thank God.
You look exhausted!
How are you bearing up?
Bertie.
The decision's been made, I...
I am going.
I cannot accept that.
You are in no condition to make that decision.
I'm afraid there's no other way.
I must marry her.
My mind's made up.
I'm... sorry.
That's a terrible thing to hear.
David, nobody wants that.
I least of all.
"At long last I am able to say, a few words of my own.
I have never wanted to withhold anything, but until now, it has not been constitutionally possible for me to speak.
A few hours ago I discharged my last duty... as King and Emperor.
And now that I have been succeeded by my brother, the Duke of York my first words must be to declare my allegiance to him.
This I do with all my heart.
You all know the reasons which have impelled me to renounce the throne.
But you must believe me, when I tell you
I have found it impossible to carry the heavy burden of responsibility and to discharge my duties..
as King as I would wish to do... without the help and support of the woman I love.
And I want you to know.
This decision has been made less difficult to me... by the sure knowledge that my brother, with his long training in the public affairs of this country... and with his fine qualities... will be able to take my place forth with... without interruption or injury... to the life and progress of the empire."
I meet you at today... in circumstances which are...
I'm sure you will love it.
Thank you darling, saddles, Margret.
- Yes mom.
- Good boy.
Mama, will we have space for our horses in our new home?
Of course we will, darling, we'll have a palace of rooms.
Curtsey.
Your Majesty.
How was it?
I'm trying to familiarise myself with what a state paper looks like.
A despatch from Mr Baldwin which I don't understand a word of.
David's finances.
The Christmas... broadcast.
I think that might be a mistake.
Don't worry about that.
Plans for the Coronation
I think that's an even bigger mistake.
I'm not a King.
I'm a naval officer.
That's all I know.
I'm not here.
I'm not a King.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Please, please.
Oh, dear.
Dear, dear man.
You know...
I refused your first two marriage proposals, not because I didn't love you, but because I couldn't bear the idea of a Royal life.
Couldn't bear the idea of a life of tours and public duties, a life that no longer was really to be my own.
But then I thought... he stammers so beautifully... they'll leave us alone.
Waiting for a king to apologize, one can wait rather a long wait.
I'm afraid we're slightly late.
This is home.
Myrtle's at bridge.
I've made sure the boys are out.
It's lovely.
Absolutely lovely.
May I sit down?
Yes, of course.
Would you like some tea, Ma'am?
Yes.
I'll help myself.
Off you go...
Or must I knock your heads together?
Here's your shilling,
I...
I understand... what you were trying to say, Logue.
I went about it the wrong way.
I'm sorry.
So, here I am.
Is the nation ready for two... minutes of radio silence?
Every stammerer always fears they will fall back to square one.
I don't let that happen.
If I fail in my duty...
David could come back.
I've seen the placard.
"God save our...
King."
They don't mean me.
Every other monarch in history succeeded someone who was dead, or just about to be.
My predecessor is not only alive, but very much so.
What a bloody mess!
I can't even give them a Christmas Speech.
Like your Dad used to do?
Precisely.
He's not here anymore.
Yes he is.
He's on that shilling I gave you.
Easy enough to give away.
You don't have to carry him around in your pocket.
Or your brother.
You don't need to be afraid of the things as you were afraid of when you were five.
You're very much your own man, Bertie.
Am I?
Your face is next, mate.
Lionel?
Myrtle!
- Is it alright?
- Yes.
Bertie, come here.
- Are you alright, Logue?
- Yes.
- Shall we go through?
- Trust me.
It's important.
What is it?
- Your...
Your...
- It's your Majesty?
The first time.
After that, it's Ma'am.
As in Ham, not Malm as in Palm.
I haven't told her about us.
Sit down, relax.
I'm told your husband calls my husband Bertie and my husband calls your husband Lionel.
I trust you won't call me Liz.
Your Majesty, you may call me Mrs Logue, Ma'am.
Very nice to meet you, Mrs Logue.
Logue, we can't stand here all day.
Yes we can.
Look, I need to wait for the right moment.
Logue, you're being a coward!
You're damn right.
Get out there, man!
Hello, Myrtle darling!
You're early.
I believe you two have met!
But I didn't think, you know...
King George the Sixth.
It's very nice to meet you.
Will their Majesties be staying to dinner?
We would love to, such a treat, but alas... a previous engagement.
What a pitty.
- Archbishop.
- Welcome, your Majesty.
What a glorious tranformation, Sir.
I hope you'll forgive us if we continue our preparations.
And now you will allow me to guide you through the ceremony.
We begin of course at the West door, then into the nave.
I see you all your pronouncements are to be broadcast, Archbishop.
Ah, yes, wireless is indeed a Pandora's Box.
I'm afraid I also have to permit the newsreel cameras.
The product of which I shall personally edit.
Without momentary hesitation.
This is Doctor Logue of Harley Street.
He's my speech therapist.
- Your Grace.
- Had I known that Your Majesty was seeking assistance
I should've made my own recommendation.
Dr. Logue... will be attending the Coronation.
Well of course I shall speak with the Dean, but it was extremely difficult.
I should like the Doctor to be seated in the King's Box.
But members of your Family will be seated there, Sir.
That is why it's suitable.
And now, if you don't mind Your Grace, we need the premises.
My dear fellow, this is Westminster Abbey!
The Church must prepare his Majesty.
My preparations are equalized in important
With complete privacy, if you don't mind.
Those are my wishes, Your Grace.
I shall place the Abbey at Your majesty's disposal... this evening.
Your Majesty.
I can't believe I'm walking on...
Chaucer and Handel and Dickens.
Everything alright?
Let's get cracking.
I'm not here to rehearse, Doctor Logue.
Call me Lionel.
True, you... never...
called yourself "Doctor".
I did that... for you.
No training, no... diploma, no... qualifications.
Just a... great deal of nerve.
The star chamber inquisition, is it?
You asked trust.
And... total equality.
Bertie, I heard you at Wembley.
I was there.
My son Laurie said dad, do you think you could help that poor man?
What, as a failed actor!
?
It's true, I'm not a doctor, and yes I acted a bit,
Well I recited in pubs and taught elocution in schools.
When the Great War came, all our Soldiers were returning straight from the front, a lot of them shell-shocked, unable to speak
somebody said, Lionel, you're very good at all this speech stuff.
Do you think you can possibly help these poor buggers?
I did muscle therapy, exercise, relaxation, but I knew I had to go deeper.
These poor young blokes had cried out in fear, no-one was listening to them.
My job was to give them faith in their own voice and let them know that a friend was listening.
That must ring a few bells with you, Bertie.
You give a very noble account of yourself.
Make inquiries.
It's all true.
Inquiries have been made!
You have no idea who I have breathing down my neck?
I vouched for you and you have no... credentials.
But lots of success!
I can't show you certificate... there was no training then.
Everything I know I know from experience, and that war... was some experience.
My plaque says, "L.Logue, Speech Defects."
No Dr., there are no letters after my name.
Lock me in the Tower.
I would if I could!
- On what charge?
- Fraud!
With war looming, you've saddled this nation with a voiceless King.
You destroyed the happiness of my family.
All for the sake of ensnaring a star... patient you couldn't possibly hope to assist!
It'll be like mad...
King George the Third, there'll be mad King George the stammerer... who let his people down so badly in their hour of need!
What're you doing?
Get up!
You can't sit there!
Get up!
Why not?
It's a chair.
No, that's not a chair, that is... that is...
That is Saint Edward's Chair!
People have carved their names on it.
That chair is the seat on which every King and Queen.
It's held in a place by a large rock!
That's the Stone of Scone yard,
- you are trivialising everything.
- You believe such bollocks.
You're trivialising everything!
I don't care how many royal...
- Listen to me.
Listen to me!
- arse have sat in this chair.
- Listen to me!
- Listen to you?
By what right?
By the divine right, if you must!
I'm your King!
No you're not!
You told me so yourself.
You said you didn't want it.
Why should I waste my time listening to you?
Because I have a right to be heard!
- Heard as what?
- I HAVE A VOICE!
Yes you do.
You have such a perservance,
Bertie, you're the bravest man I know.
And you'll make a bloody good king.
What on earth's going on, Sir?
It's quite alright, Archbishop.
Mr Logue, you must know that I found a replacement English specialist with impeccable credentials.
Hence, your services will no longer be required.
I'm sorry?
Your Majesty's function is to consult and be advised.
And you didn't consult, but you've just been advised.
Now I advise you:
In this personal matter I will make my own decision.
My concern is for the head upon which I must place the crown.
I appreciate that Archbshop, but it's my head!
Your humble servant.
Thank you Bertie.
Shall we rehearse?
Come on upon your purge.
Now when you and Elizabeth enter through the West door, you'll be greeted by the hymn "I was glad when they said onto me"
Actually you won't be that glad, because they sing it for a very long time.
Then your friend the Archbishop will ponce up the stairs toward you and say "Sir, is Your Majesty willing to take The oath"
- "I am willing"
- Course you are!
I'm gonna see what it sounds like in the cheap seats so even your old nanny can hear.
"Will you govern your peoples of Great Britain, Ireland, Canada,
Australia and New Zealand according to their lands and customs"
"I solemnly promise so do so."
Louder!
I can't hear you up the back.
"I solemnly promise so do so."
Very good!
"Will you to your power cause Law and Justice, in Mercy, to be executed in all your judgements?"
"I will." "I WILL!"
Then there's a very long bit about upholding the faith, goes on, rubbish, rubbish, rubbish.
To which you finally say...
"The things which I have...
here before promised,
I will perform and keep."
So help me God
And that's all you'll say.
Four short responses, kiss the book and sign the oath and you're King.
Easy.
You nearly crowned him backwards Archbishop!
Someone had removed the thread marking the back of the Crown, Sir.
Try not lose the thread, Archbishop.
Archbishop, we're missing Papa.
Very good, very good.
Archbishop.
Well, I hope Your Majesties are thrilled with the result.
You could switch that machine off now.
No, wait, keep going.
Do have a seat, Archbishop.
Papa?
Papa, what's he saying?
I don't know, but he seems to be saying it rather well.
Sir, I have asked to see you today... in order to tender my resignation as Prime Minister.
I am so sorry to hear that, Mr Baldwin.
Neville Chamberlain will take my place as Prime Minister.
It's a matter of principal.
I was mistaken.
I have found it impossible to believe... that there is any man in the world... so lacking in moral feeling as Hitler,
but the world may be hurled for... a second time into the abyss of destructive War.
Churchill was right all along.
This was always Hitler's intention.
I am many very sorry to leave you in this great time of crisis.
I am very much afraid Sir, that your greatest test is yet to come.
I am speaking to you from the cabinet room... at 10 Downing Street.
This morning the British Ambassador in Berlin... handed the German Government a final note... stating that unless we heard from them by 11 oclock, that they were prepared at once... to withdraw their troops from Poland,
a state of war would exist between us.
I have to tell you now that no such undertaking has been received,
and that consequently, this country is at war with Germany.
At last Sir, here is your speech.
You are on air at six.
I've timed it at just under nine minutes.
The wording is fully approved.
The Prime Minister will be joining you for the broadcast which will go out live across the Nation, the Empire and to our Armed Forces.
Get Logue here immediately.
- There's the barrage balloons.
- Yes.
- They got them up there quickly.
- Yeah.
Should we pull over and find shelter?
No, go straight on.
We'll be alright
- Yes.
Sir?
- Lionel Logue.
Major Hartley's expecting me.
This is my son Laury.
- Thank you, Laurie.
- Good luck, Dad.
- The King's Speech.
- Thank you, Sir.
We have about forty minutes to the broadcast.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
"there may be dark days ahead, and..."
Try again.
"there may be dark days ahead, and..."
Turn the hesitations into pauses... and say to yourself, "God save the King."
I say that continuously, but apparently no one's listening.
Long pauses are good.
They add solemnity to great occasions.
Then I'm the solemnest king who ever lived.
You know, if I am to be King, where is my power?
Can I...
Can I reform a government?
Can I...
Can I...
levy a tax?
Declare a war?
No.
Yet I am the seat of all authority.
Why?
Because the Nation believes that when I...
I speak, I speak for them.
But I cannot speak!
Let's take it all again from the top.
"In this grave hour"
In this grave hour...
Fuck, fuck, fuck.
perhaps the most fateful in our history...
Bugger, shit, shit.
I send to every household of my...
You see, "P" is always difficult, even when I'm singing.
Bounce on to it. "A peoples."
- Not people.
- A people.
Household of my peoples both at home...
- and overseas.
- Beautiful.
this message, doo-dah day.
spoken with the same depth of feeling.
Doo-dah day... for each one of you as if I were able to...
Shit, fuck, bugger!
cross your threshold and speak to you...
In your head, now. "I have a right to be bloody well heard."
Bloody well heard, bloody well heard, bloody well heard myself!
Now, waltz.
Move.
Get continuous movement.
For the second time in the lives of most of us we are at...
- "We are," Take a pause.
- Lionel, I can't do this.
Bertie, you can do it.
- Have a look at the last paragraph.
- Bertie, it's time.
- Archbishop.
- Your Majesty.
A great moment, Sir.
- Prime Minister.
- Your Majesty.
Nice to see you... again so soon.
Good of you to be here.
I'm sure you've had rather a busy day.
Let's hope we have no more interruptions from those damned sirens, Sir.
Or the wretched dogs.
Congrat...
Congratulations.
First Lord of the Admiralty.
Your Majesty.
The long... walk.
Good luck, Sir.
I, too, dread this apparatus.
Had a speech impediment myself, you know.
- I didn't.
- Family secret.
Tongue-tied.
An operation was considered to be too dangerous.
I eventually made an asset of it.
- Thank you, Mr Churchill.
- Sir.
Darling.
How long, Logue?
Just under three minutes, Sir.
- Mr Wood.
- Good luck, Your Majesty.
Mr Wood.
You'll be decorated, Logue.
I made it cosy.
Some fresh air.
There you are, Darling.
I'm thistle sifter, I've a sieve of sifted thistles and a sieve on unsifted thistles.
I've a sieve of sifted thistles and a sieve on unsifted thistles, because I'm...
Bertie, darling, make sure it's not switched on!
Remember the red light will blink four times and then I've asked them to turn it off, because we don't want that evil eye staring at you all the way through.
One minute, sir.
I am sure you will be splendid.
Fourty seconds, Sir.
Logue, however this turns out,
I don't know how to thank you for what you've done.
Knighthood?
Twenty seconds.
Forget everything else and just say it to me.
Say it to me, as a friend.
In this grave hour,
perhaps the most fateful in our history,
I send to every household of my peoples,
both at home... and overseas,
this message... spoken with the same depth of feeling... for each one of you... as if I were able to cross your threshold... and speak to you myself.
For the second time in the lives of most of us, we are at... at war.
Over and over again, we have tried to find... a peaceful way out of the differences between ourselves... and those who are now our enemies.
But it has been in vain.
We have been forced into a conflict.
For we are called, to meet the challenge of a principle which, if it were to prevail, would be fatal to any civilized order... in the world.
Such a principle, stripped of all disguise,
is surely the mere... primitive doctrine that might is right.
For the sake of all that we ourselves hold dear, it is unthinkable that we should refuse to meet the challenge.
It is to this high purpose that I now call... my people at home and my peoples across the seas, who will make our cause their own.
I ask them to stand calm and firm, and united in this time of trial.
The task will be hard.
There may be dark days ahead, and war can no longer be confined to the battlefield.
But we can only do the right as we see the right... and reverently commit our cause to God.
If one and all we keep resolutely faithful to it, then, with God's help,
we shall prevail.
Very good, Bertie.
You still stammered on the "w"?
Had to throw in a few so they knew it was me.
Congratulations, your Majesty.
A true broadcaster.
Thank you, Mr Wood.
Congratulations, your Majesty.
- Congratulations, your Majesty.
- Thank you.
Ready.
- Good?
- Perfect.
Your first war time speech.
Congratulations.
Expect I shall have to do a great deal more.
Thank you, Logue.
Well done, my friend.
Thank you, Your Majesty.
I knew you'd be good.
Thank you, Lionel.
Onwards?
Congratulations, Sir.
Almost did it better than myself, Sir.
Your Majesty, I'm speechless.
Congratulations, Sir.
Gentlemen.
Congratulations, your Majesty.
So how was Papa, Elizabeth?
Halting at first, but you got much better Papa.
Bless you.
- And how about you, Margaret?
- You were just splendid, Papa.
Of course I was.
We all ready?
Come on girls.
You are live in two minutes, Your Royal Highness.
Sir?
At the microphone, Do your work Sir.
I am sure you will be splendid.
Just take your time.
Time to go.
BBC NEWS READER :
Good afternoon.
This is the BBC National Programme and Empire Services taking you to Wembley Stadium for the Closing Ceremony of the Empire Exhibition.
where His Royal Highness the Duke of York will read a message from His Father;
His Majesty, King George V.
58 British Colonies and Dominions have taken part, making this the largest Exhibition staged anywhere in the world.
Remember Sir, Three flashes;
then steady 'red' means you are Live.
BBC NEWS READER :
Using the new invention of radio,
The Opening Ceremony was the first time his Majesty the King addressed his subjects on the wireless.
At the close of the first Season,
The heir to the throne His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales, made his first broadcast.
And today, his younger brother His Royal Highness, the Duke of York will give his inaugural broadcast to the Nation and the World.
I have received... from his Majesty....t' ek
...The King.
SIR BLANDINE-BENTHAM:
Inhale deep into your lungs..
Your Royal Highness.
Relaxes your larynx, does it not?
Cigarette smoking calms the nerves and gives you confidence.
If Your Highness will be very kind as to open your hand...
It's Sterilized.
Now..
Now...if I may take the liberty?
...insert some into your mouth.
Excuse me, Doctor.
What is the purpose of this?
The classic approach, it cured Demosthenes.
That was in Ancient Greece...uh
Has it worked since?
Now, if you would be so kind as to read...
A wealth of words.
Fight against those marbles, Your Royal Highness.
Enunciate!
A little more concentration your Royal Highness.
I nearly swallowed the bloody things!
Thank you so much, Doctor, it's been most...hmm interesting.
Insert marbles!
He can insert his own bloody marbles....!
Tick, tock, tick, tock.
You know, you can't keep doing this, Bertie.
I know.
Promise me:
no more.
Hello.
Is anyone there?
I'm just in the loo.
Ah, Mrs. Johnson There you are.
I'm sorry, there's no receptionist.
I like to keep things simple.
"Poor and content is rich and rich enough"
- Sorry?
- Shakespeare.
How are you?
How do you do?
Coughing a lot.
Now, this is slightly awkward, But..
I'm afraid you're late.
Yes, I'm afraid I am.
Where's Mr. Johnson?
He doesn't know I'm here.
That's not a promising start.
My husband has seen everyone to no avail.
Awfully 'fraid he's given up hope.
He hasn't seen me.
You're awfully sure of yourself.
Well, I'm sure of anyone who wants to be cured.
Of course, he wishes to be cured.
My husband is umm..
he's required to speak publicly.
Perhaps he should change jobs?
- He can't.
Indentured servitude?
Something of that nature.
Well we need to have your hubby pop by...
Uh..
Tuesday would be good...
He can give me his personal details and I'll make a frank appraisal and then, We can take it from there.
Doctor, forgive me.
I do not have a "hubby".
We don't 'pop'.
and nor do we ever talk about our private lives.
You...
must come to us.
I'm Sorry, Mrs. Johnson, my game, my turf, my rules.
You'll have to talk over this with your husband and then you can speak to me on the telephone.
Thank you very much for dropping by...
Good afternoon.
And what if my husband were the Duke of York?
The Duke of York?
Yes...
the Duke of York.
I thought the appointment was for "Johnson"?
Forgive me, your ...?
- ..
Royal Highness.
Johnson was used during the Great War;
when the Navy didn't want the enemy to know 'he' was aboard.
- Am I...considered the enemy?
You will be, if you remain un- obliging.
Of course.
How did you find me, Your Royal Highness?
The President of the Speech Therapists Society.
Eileen McCleod?
She's a sport.
Dr McCleod warned me your antipodean methods were "unorthodox and controversial".
I warned her...
those were not my favorite words.
I can cure your husband.
But for my method to work I need trust and total equality;
Here, in the safety of my consultation room.
No exceptions.
Well then, in that case...
When can you start?
Still sounds a bit rough, mate.
You make me drive too slowly, Dad!
Did you pick mum up from Bridge?
Yes, I've hardly been out of the car all day.
I had a special visitor this afternoon.
- May I please leave this table
- How special, special?
No, You must stay, bored stupid, listening to your parents' inane conversation.
- Thanks Dad..
- and Mum.
- Me too.
- You meeting Jean?
- No, someone else.
Doctor?
Doctor?
Can't you help your brother with the washing...
I'm fine.
Who's it Lionel?
Why bring it up if you can't talk about it?
Myrtle, It's just a woman, looking to help her husband.
Oh!
And I had a 'call'.
for an audition.
One of my favorites.
- Aren't they all?
It Could be a lot of fun.
I'm sure you'll be splendid.
They're a highly regarded group.
From Putney.
Tomorrow, Chapter IV.
'The Flight'.
Oh, to fly away!
Weren't they lucky!
Now Papa tell a story!
- Could I be a penguin instead?
Once, there were two princesses...
Princess Elizabeth and Princess Margaret.
whose Papa was a penguin.
This was because he had been turned into one by the wicket witch.
This was an...
inconvenient for him..
because he loved to hold his princesses in his arms... and you can't because he don't have wings like herrings
- Herrings don't have wings.
- Penguins have wings which is shaped like herrings and make matters worse... is that she sent him to the South Pole.
which is an awfully long walk..back.
if you can't fly.
So..
When he reached the water, he dived in through the dept so fast... that he was in Southampton waters by lunchtime.
And from there, he took the 2.30 to Weybridge, changed at Clapham Junction and asked a passing Mallard the way to Buckingham Palace.
He swam up the Thames, out through the plughole, and gave the cook,
Mama and ...
Mrs. Whittaker quite a shock.
Now when the girls heard all the commotions, they ran to the kitchen where they gave him a good scrub, a mackerel and a kiss.
and as they kissed him, guess what he turned into?
- A handsome prince.
A short-tailed Albatross.
With wings so big that he could wrap them both his two girls together.
Now, now..
It's time for bed.
Will Mrs. Simpson be there?
- My brother's insisting.
- Is he serious?
- About her coming to dinner?
- No.
About her!
- A married woman?
He can't be.
- She can.
By the way,
I think I found someone rather interesting.
On Harley Street.
A doctor.
- Out of the question.
I'm not having this conversation again.
The matter's settled.
- His approach seems rather different....
Now?
Now.
"Now is the winter of our discontent,
Made glorious summer by this sun of York".
"And all the clouds that lour'd upon our house
In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.
Now are our brows, bound with victorious... wreaths;
- Thank you!
Lovely diction Mr...?
- Logue.
Lionel Logue.
- Well, Mr. Logue.
I'm not hearing the cries of a deformed creature yearning to be King.
Nor did I realize Richard the Third was King of the Colonies.
I do know the lines.
I've played the role before.
- Sydney?
- Perth.
- Major theater town, is it?
-Enthusiastic.
- Ah.
- I was well reviewed.
Yes...
well...
Lionel,
I think our dramatic society, is looking for someone slightly younger and a... little more regal.
Where did you find this...physician?
Classifieds, next to "French model, Shepherd's Market".
He comes highly recommended.
Charges substantial fees in order to help the poor.
Oh dear, perhaps he's a Bolshevik?
!
No receptionist.
He likes to keep things simple.
- The Johnsons.
You can go in now, "Mr. Johnson".
Lionel says... wait here if you wish, Mrs. Johnson.
Or, it being a p- pleasant day, p-perhaps take a stroll.
Was that alright...
Lionel?
Marvellous!
Willy.
You can stay and wait for your mom.
Mrs. Johnson...
Mr. Johnson, Do come in.
He's a good lad, Willy.
He could hardly make a sound, you know, when he first came to me.
My boys made those.
Good, aren't they?
Please make yourself comfortable.
I was told not to sit too close.
Well I believe when speaking with a Prince,
One waits for the prince to choose a topic.
Waiting for me to...
commence a conversation ..
one can wait a rather long wait.
Do you Know any jokes?
Timing isn't my strong suit.
Cuppa tea?
No thank you.
Aren't you going to start treating me Dr Logue?
Only if you're interested in being treated.
Please, call me Lionel.
I prefer Doctor.
I prefer Lionel.
What'll I call you?
Your Royal Highness, then Sir after that.
A bit formal for here.
What about your name?
Prince Albert ...
Frederick Arthur George?
How about Bertie?
Only my family uses that.
Perfect.
In here, it's better if we're equals.
If we were equal I wouldn't be here.
I'd be at home with my wife and no-one would give a damn.
Please, Don't do that.
I'm sorry?
I believe, Sucking smoke into your lungs will kill you.
My physicians say it relaxes the throat.
They're idiots.
They've all been knighted.
Makes it official then.
My 'castle', my rules.
What was your earliest memory?
What?
an earth do you mean?
Your First recollection.
I'm not... here to discuss my personal matters.
Why're you here then?
Because I bloody well stammer!
You have a bit of a temper?
One of my many faults.
When did the defect start?
I've always been this way!
I doubt that.
Don't tell me!
It's my stammer!
- Its my field.
I can assure you, no infant starts to speak with a stammer.
When did yours start?
four or five.
That's typical.
So I've been told.
I can't remember not doing it.
I can believe that.
Do you hesitate when you think?
Don't be ridiculous.
How about when you talk to yourself?
Everyone natters occasionally Bertie.
Stop calling me that!
I'm not going to call you anything else.
Then we shan't speak!
Are you charging for this, Doctor?
A fortune.
So, when you talk to yourself, do you stammer?
Of course not!
Well, that proves your impediment isn't a permanent part of you.
What do you think was the cause?
I don't know.
I don't care!
I stammer!
And no one can fix it.
I Bet you, you can read flawlessly, right here, right now.
And if I win, I get to ask questions.
- And if I win?
- You don't have to answer.
One usually ...
wagers money.
A bob each to sweeten it?
Lets See your shilling?
- I don't...
carry money.
- I had a funny feeling you mightn't.
I'll stake you.
You can Pay me back next time.
- Who says there is a next time?
- I haven't agreed to take you on, yet.
Please stand.
and take a look at that...
I can't read this.
Then you owe me a shilling , for not trying.
"To be...
or not to be,....
That...
I can't read!
I haven't finished yet.
I'm going to record your voice and then play it back to you on the same machine.
This is brilliant.
It's the latest thing from America:
its a Silvertone.
Pop this on?
There's a bob in this, mate.
You can go home rich!
- You're playing music.
- I know.
How can I hear what I'm saying?
!
Surely a Prince's brain knows what its mouth is doing?
You're not well acquainted with Royal Princes, are you?
Hopeless.
Hopeless!
You were sublime.
Would I lie to a prince of the realm to win twelve-pence?
I've no idea what an Australian might do for that sort of money.
Let me play it back to you.
No.
All right then, I get to ask you the question.
Thank you Doctor,
I don't feel..
this is for me.
Thank You for your time, Bye.
- Sir?
the recording is free.
Please..
keep it as a souvenir.
KING GEORGE V (O.S.) For the present, the work to which we are all equally bound, is to arrive at a reasoned tranquility within our borders, to regain prosperity in this time of depression without self-seeking
and to carry with us those whom the burden of past years has disheartened or overborne.
To all, to each,
I wish a Happy Christmas.
God bless you.
Easy when you know how.
Have a go yourself.
Congratulations, Sir.
Ah, Mr. Wood.
Splendid fellow.
Chap taught me everything I know:
let the microphone do the work.
Sit up, straight back, face boldly up to the bloody thing and stare it square in the eye, as you would any decent Englishman.
Show who's in command.
Papa, I D-d-don't thu-thu-think I c-c-can read this.
- This devilish device will change everything if you don't.
In the past all a King had to do was look respectable in uniform and not fall off his horse.
Now we must invade people's homes and ingratiate ourselves with them.
This family is reduced to those lowest, basest of all creatures... we've become...actors!
- we're not a family, we're a firm.
- Yet at any moment, some of us may be out of work.
Your darling brother, and future king!
The only wife he appears interested in is invariably the wife of another!
- He's broken off with Lady Furness.
And taken up a Mrs. Simpson, a woman with two husbands living!
I told him straight, no divorced person could ever be received at court.
He said, "It made him sublimely happy."
I imagined that was because she was sleeping with him.
"I give you my word..' this is what he said.
"I give you my word we've never had immoral relations,"
Stared square into his father's eyes...
and lied!
When I'm dead that boy will ruin himself, this family, and this nation, within twelve months.
Who'll pick up the pieces?
Herr Hitler, intimidating half of Europe, Marshall Stalin the other half?
Who'll stand between us, the jackboots, and the proletarian abyss?
You?
With your older brother shirking his duties, you're going to have to do a lot more of this.
Have a go yourself.
Son.
Get it out boy!
...m-marvels of m-
- Modern... just take your time - form your words carefully
Science, I am enabled, this ...
- Relax!
Just try it!
Do it!
Lying ..
bastard.
"To be, or not to be, - that is the question: -
"...whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles, And by opposing end them.."
"..to die...
to sleep; no more.."
Strictly business.
No p..
personal nonsense.
I thought I'd made that very clear in our interview.
- Got the shilling you owe me?
- No I haven't!
- Didn't think so.
Besides, you tricked me!
Physical exercises and tricks are important...
What you're asking will only deal with the surface of the problem.
That's sufficient.
As far as I see it, My husband... has mechanical difficulties with his speech.
Maybe...
Just deal with that.
- I'm willing to work hard, Doctor Logue...
- Lionel.
- Are you..
are you willing to do your part?
Alright.
You want mechanics?
We need to relax your throat muscles and strengthen your tongue.
By repeating tongue twisters for example.
"I am a thistle-sifter.
I have a sieve of sifted thistles and a sieve of unsifted thistles.
Because I am a thistle sifter."
- Fine!
You have a flabby tummy, we must build up the strength in your diaphragm.
Simple mechanics.
That is all we ask.
And that's about a shilling's worth.
Forget about the blessed shilling!
Perhaps, upon occasion, you might be requested some assistance in cope with a minor event.
Will that agreeable?
Of course.
That will be the full extent of your services.
- Shall I see you next week?
- I shall see you every day.
Ahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahah.
Feel the loosening of the jaw
Take a nice deep breath.
Expand your chest..
How do you feel?
full of hot air.
- Isn't that what public speaking is all about?
Are you alright, Bertie?
This is actually quite good fun,
- Hello, Bertie.
- Hello David.
Where've you been?
Been busy.
- So was I.
Elizabeth has pneumonia.
I'm sorry.
She'll recover.
Father won't.
- I'll drive.
Old bugger's doing this on purpose.
Dying?
Departing prematurely...
to complicate matters.
Oh for heaven's sake, David.
You know how long he's been ill.
Wallis explained.
She's terribly clever about this thing.
LORD WIGRAM:
... whereas by letters patent under the Great Seal, bearing date of Westminster, the eleventh June 1912 his Majesty King George V did constitute, order and declare that there should be a guardian,
Custos Regni, in the form of Councillors of State
It's the order of the Council for the State, Sir.
So we may act on your behalf.
I'm still confused...
Approved.
Thank you.
Feeling a little better Sir?
No.
I'm not feeling any better.
I feel dreadful.
Have you been ice skating?
..Ice skating.
No, George.
...I know, darling, a talk, even a lovely long talk, is a poor substitute for holding tight and making drowsy.
Nor making our own drowsies either, as we've had to do far too often lately.
David, Dinner?
- I'm on with Wallis!
Wallis misses me terribly.
- Mama says you're late for dinner.
- She forgets Papa's bloody clocks were always half an hour fast!
How is the king?
I hope he is not in pain.
No, no, His Majesty, he's quieter now.
Thank you.
David, If your father were well, tardiness would not be tolerated.
None of this..
unpleasantness would be tolerated
You know Sir, I appreciate that yo are different from your father in your outlook and temperament.
I want you to know that whenever the King questioned your conduct,
I tried in your interest, to present it in a most favourable light.
I can always trust you to have my best interests at heart.
I fear, our vigil will not be of long duration.
Please, continue.
We commend our brother George to the mercy of God, our Maker and Redeemer.
Long live the King.
I hope, I will make good as he has made good.
What on earth was that?
Poor Wallis.
Now I'm trapped!
Time for a Shake, dad?
You sure?
Go on.
Put your thinking caps on.
Bet its the Scottish Play.
No, I bet it's Othello.
It's always Othello.
"Art thou afeard?"
Caliban!
Oh!
For heaven's sake.. that was a lucky guess!
Don't listen to egghead.
Go on, Dad.
"the isle is full of noises, sounds and sweet airs, that give delight, and hurt not.
Sometimes a thousand twanging instruments Will hum about mine ears;
and sometimes voices, that, if then I had waked after long sleep, will make me sleep again:"
Alright, clever clogs, what comes next?
"..and then, in dreaming, The clouds me thought would open,
and show riches Ready to drop upon me;
that when I'm awake..."
...when I waked, I cried to dream again."
It's such a sad thought.
My next patient must be early.
You better go lads, I'm sorry.
Won't be a moment, Clifford.
Bertie!
they told me not to expect you.
I am Sorry about your father.
I don't wish to intrude..
oh no...
course.
Please come in.
I've been practising.
One hour a day.
In spite of everything.
What's going on there?
I was, sorry, mucking around with my kids.
Do you feel like working today?
A Curtis bi-plane.
I'll put on some hot milk.
Logue, I'd kill for something stronger.
I wasn't there for my father's death.
Still makes me sad.
I can imagine so.
What did you father do?
He was a brewer.
At least there was free beer.
Here's to the memory of your father.
I was informed, after the fact... that my father's last words were:
"Bertie has more guts than the rest of his brothers put together."
He couldn't say that to my face.
My brother.
What about him?
Try singing.
I'm sorry.
Know any songs?
Songs?
Yes songs.
"Swanee River".
I love that song.
Happens to be my favorite.
Sing me the chorus.
No.
Certainly not.
Always wanted to build models.
Father wouldn't allow it.
He collected stamps.
we had to collect stamps.
You can finish that off.
If you sing.
I'm not going to sit here, wobbling.
You can with me.
Because you're peculiar.
I take that as a compliment.
I'm not crooning "Swanee River!"
Try "Camptown Races" then.
"My brother D, he said to me, doo- dah doo-dah..." Continuous sound will give you flow.
Does it feel strange, now that David's on the throne?
To tell the truth,
It was a relief...
Knowing I wouldn't be King.
But unless he produces an heir, you're next in line.
And your daughter, Elizabeth, would then succeed you.
"You're barking up the wrong tree now, Doctor, Doctor."
"Lionel" See?
You didn't stammer.
Of course I didn't stammer, I was singing!
Well, as a little reward, you get to put some glue on these struts.
Your boy, won't mind?
No, not at all.
David and I were very close.
Young bucks...
You know.
Chase the same girls?
David was always very helpful in arranging introductions.
We shared the expert ministrations of "Paulette" in Paris.
Not at the same time of course.
Did David tease you?
Yes, they all did.
"Buh-buh-buh-Bertie".
Father encouraged it. "Get it out, boy!" Said it would make me stop.
Said..."I was afraid of my father, and my children are damn well going to be afraid of me".
Are you naturally right handed?
Left.
I was punished.
Now I use the right.
Yes, that's very common with stammerers.
Anything other corrections?
Knock knees.
Metal splints were made...worn night and day.
That must have been painful.
Bloody agony.
Straight legs now.
Who were you closest to in your family?
Nannies.
Not my first nanny, though..she loved David...hated me.
When we are presented to my parents for the daily viewing, she'd pinch me..
I'd cry and be handed back to her..
immediately.
Then...
she would...
Sing it.
" then she wouldn't feed me, far far away."
Took three years for my parents to notice.
As you can imagine, it caused some stomach problems.
Still.
What about your brother Johnnie?
Were you close to him?
Johnny..
Sweet boy.
Epilepsy...and... he was 'different'.
Died at 13, hidden from view.
I've been told it's not catching.
Do you want a top-up?
Please.
You know, Lionel, you're the first ordinary Englishman...
Australian.
...I've ever really spoken to.
Sometimes, when I ride through the streets and see, you know, the Common Man staring at me,
I'm struck by how little I know of his life, and how little he knows of mine.
Thank you.
What're friends for.
I wouldn't know.
"I sifted seven thick-stalked thistles through strong thick sieves.
I sifted seven..."
One hundred year old oaks...removed to improve the view!
Who does she think she is!
Nonetheless...we must try to be pleasant towards Mrs. Simpson.
You know she calls me "The Fat Scottish Cook"?
You're not fat.
I'm getting plump.
You seldom cook.
I sifted seven.
Shut up!
Their Royal Highnesses the Duke and Duchess of York.
How lovely to see you both.
Welcome to our little country shack.
I came at the invitation of the King.
Hello David.
you're making some changes to the garden, I see yes, I am.
I am not quite finished.
Don't tell me I behaved badly, Mr. Churchill.
On the contrary, your Royal Highness.
Etiquette decrees royalty must be greeted by the official host: in this case: the King.
Not a commoner.
- Thank you.
What is her hold on him?
I have no idea.
Apparently she has certain...skills, ...in an establishment in Shanghai.
David, I've been trying to see you...
I've been terribly busy.
Doing what?
Kinging.
Kinging?
is a precarious business!
These days.
Where is the Russian Tsar?
Where is Cousin Wilhelm?
You're being dreary.
Is Kinging laying off eighty staff at Sandringham and buying yet more pearls for Wallis while there are people marching across Europe singing "The Red Flag"?
Stop your worrying.
Herr Hitler will sort that lot out.
Who'll sort out Herr Hitler?
And you've put that woman into our mother's suite?
Mother's not still in the bed, is she?
That's not funny.
Wally likes the very best.
I don't care what woman you carry on with at night, as long as you show up for duty in the morning!
Wally is not just some woman I am carrying on with.
We intend to marry.
Excuse me?
She's filing a petition for divorce.
Good God.
Can't you just give her a nice house and a title?
I won't have her as my mistress.
David, the Church does not recognise divorce and you are the head of the Church.
Haven't I any rights?
Many privileges...
Not the same thing.
Your beloved Common Man may marry for love, why not me?
If you were the Common Man, on what basis could you possibly claim to be King?
!
Sounds like you've studied our wretched constitution.
Sounds like you haven't.
Is that what this is all about?
Brushing up..
hence the elocution lessons?
I'm trying to t-t...
Yearning for a larger audience are we, B-b-b-bertie?
D-don't ...
Younger brother trying to push older brother off throne..
Pa pa..
...Positively medieval.
Where have you been all this time?
- Never you mind.
Ahh..what a complicated lovely coon you are.
- I try to be.
All that work, down the drain.
My own brother...
I couldn't say..
I couldn't say a word in reply!
Why do you stammer more with David than you do with me?
Because you're bloody well paid to listen!
Bertie, I'm not a geisha girl.
Stop trying to be so bloody clever!
What is it about David that stops you speaking?
What is it about you, that bloody makes want you to go on about it, all the time.
Vulgar but fluent.
You don't stammer when you swear.
Bugger off!
Is that the best you can do?
Well, bloody bugger to you, you beastly bastard.
A public school prig can do better than that.
Shit !
Shit, shit, shit!
shit!
See how defecation flows trippingly from the tongue?
Because I'm angry!
You Know the f-word?
Fornication?
OH Bertie.
Fuck.
Fuck, fuck, fuck!
Yes!
You see!
Not a hesitation!
Bloody, bloody, bloody!
Shit, shit, shit!
Bugger, bugger, bugger!
Fuck, fuck, fuck!
Dad?
What's going on?
Sorry.
Finish your homework
Well ..that's a side of you we don't get to see that often.
No.
No we're not supposed to really, not publicly.
Let's get some air.
No Logue, I don't think that's a good idea.
What's the matter?
What's got you so upset?
Logue, you have no idea.
My brother is infatuated with a woman who's been married twice.
She's asking for a divorce and David is determined to marry her.
Mrs. Wallis Simpson of Baltimore.
That's not right.
Queen Wallis of Baltimore?
Unthinkable.
Can he do that?
Absolutely not.
But he's going to anyway.
All hell's broken loose.
- Can't they carry on privately?
- If only they would.
- Where does that leave you?
I know my place!
I'll do anything...
in my power to keep my brother on the throne.
-Is it that serious?
your place may be on the throne.
I am not an alternative to my brother.
If you had to you could outshine David...
Don't take liberties!
That's bordering on treason.
I'm just saying you could be King.
You could do it!
That is treason!
I'm trying to get you to realise you need not be governed by fear.
I've had enough of this!
What're you afraid of?
Your poisonous words!
Why'd you come to me?
You are not some middle class bugger, who needs elocution lessons so you can chit-chat...
Don't instruct me on my duties!
I'm the son of a ....
King... the brother of a king.
You're the disappointing son of a brewer!
A jumped-up jackeroo from the outback!
You're nobody.
These sessions are over!
It's not because she's an American.
That is the least of it.
It's because she is a soon to be a twice divorced American, and the King as head of The Church of England...
can not marry a divorced woman.
And Sir, I apologize for the nature of this, according to Scotland Yard, the King has not always possess exclusive..rights
to Mrs. Simpson's...
favours and affections, sharing them with a married used car salesman, a certain Mr. Guy Trundle.
In addition, it is also rumoured...
Hitler's ambassador, Count von Ribbentrop, sends her 17 carnations every day.
Should your brother continue to ignore the advice of His Government, He must abdicate.
Otherwise His Government has no choice but to resign.
Prime Minister, you'd leave the country without a government?
Does the King do what he wants, or does he do what his people expect him to do?
What's the matter, love?
I'm Just having trouble with a patient.
That Isn't like you..
why?
He's scared...
He is afraid with his own shadow.
Isn't that why they come to you?
This fellow could be somebody great, and he's fighting me.
Perhaps, he doesn't want to be great.
Perhaps that's what you want.
I might have overstepped the mark.
Apologize,
Do you both good.
I'm very sorry, Mr. Logue, the Duke is busy.
I'm happy to wait.
Or I could come back later.
As I said, the Duke is terribly busy.
Thank you.
The parliament will not support their marriage.
But there were other reasons for concern, Sir.
He was careless with state papers.
He lacked commitment and resolve.
There were those that worried where he would stand when war comes with Germany .
We're not coming to that?
Indeed we are, Sir.
Prime Minister Baldwin may deny this, but Hitler's intent is crystal clear.
War with Germany will come, and we will need a King behind whom we can all stand united.
I fear...my brother is not of sound mind, at this time.
Have you thought what you will call yourself?
Certainly not Albert, Sir.
Too Germanic.
What about George?
After your father?
George the sixth.
It has rather a nice continuity to it, don't you think?
David!
Thank God.
You look exhausted!
How are you bearing up?
Bertie.
The decision's been made.
I have to go.
I cannot accept that.
You are in no condition to make that decision.
I'm afraid there's no other way.
I must marry her.
My mind's made up.
I'm... sorry.
That's a terrible thing to hear.
David, nobody wants that.
I least of all.
" At long last I am able to say, a few words of my own.
I have never wanted to withhold anything, but until now, it has not been constitutionally possible for me to speak.
A few hours ago I discharged my last duty as King and Emperor.
Now that I have been succeeded by my brother, the Duke of York my first words must be to declare my allegiance to him.
This I do with all my heart.
You all know the reasons which have impelled me to renounce the throne.
But you must believe me, when I tell you
I have found it impossible to carry the heavy burden of responsibility and to discharge my duties..
as King as I would wish to do without the help and support of the woman I love...
And I want you to know,
..This decision has been made less difficult to me by the sure knowledge that my brother, with his long training in the public affairs of this country and with his fine qualities will be able to take my place forth with
without interruption or injury to the life and progress of the empire."
I meet you today... in circumstances which are -
Mama, will we have space for our horses in our new home?
Of course we will, darling, we'll have a palace of rooms.
Curtsey.
Your Majesty.
How was it?
I'm trying to familiarise myself with what a state paper looks like.
A despatch from Mr. Baldwin which I don't understand a word of.
David's finances.
The Christmas broadcast -
I think that might be a mistake.
Plans for the Coronation -
I think that's an even bigger mistake.
I'm not a King.
I'm a naval officer.
Its the only thing I know.
I'm not a King.
Dear, dear man...
You know...
I refused your first two marriage proposals, not because I didn't love you, but because I couldn't bear the royal cage.
Couldn't bear the idea of a life of tours and public duties, a life that no longer was really to be my own.
But then I thought... he stammers so beautifully... they'll leave us alone.
Waiting for a king to apologize, one can wait rather a long wait.
I'm afraid we're slightly late.
This is home.
Myrtle's at bridge.
I've made sure the boys are out.
It's lovely.
Absolutely lovely.
Would you like some tea, Ma'am?
Yes.
I'll help myself.
Off you go...
Or must I knock your heads together?
Here's your shilling,
I understand... what you were trying to say, Logue.
I went about it the wrong way.
I'm sorry.
Now here I am.
Is the nation ready for two minutes of radio silence?
Every stammerer always fears they will fall back to square one.
I don't let that happen.
If I fail in my duty...
David could come back.
I've seen the placards
"Save Our King!"
They don't mean me.
Every other monarch in history succeeded someone who was dead, or just about to be.
My predecessor is not only alive, but very much so.
What a bloody mess!
I can't even give them a Christmas Speech.
Like your Dad used to do?
- Precisely.
He's not here anymore.
Yes he is.
He's on that shilling I gave you.
Easy enough to give away.
You don't have to carry him around in your pocket.
Or your brother.
You don't need to be afraid of the things as you were afraid of when you were five.
You're very much your own man, Bertie.
Am I?
Your face is next, mate.
Lionel?
Myrtle!
- Is it alright?
- Yes.
Bertie, come here.
- Are you alright, Logue?
- Yes.
- Shall we go through?
- Trust me.
It's important.
What is it?
- Your...
Your...
- It's "Your Majesty", the first title
After that, it's "Ma'am," as in Ham, not Ma'im as in Palm.
I haven't told her about us.
Sit down, relax.
I'm told your husband calls my husband Bertie and my husband calls your husband Lionel.
I trust you won't call me Liz.
Your Majesty, you may call me Mrs. Logue, Ma'am.
Very nice to meet you, Mrs. Logue.
Logue, we can't stand here all day.
Yes we can.
Look, I need to wait for the right moment.
- Logue, you're being a coward!
- You're damn right.
Get out there, man!
Hello, Myrtle darling!
You're early.
I believe you two have met!
But I didn't think, you know...
King George the Sixth.
- It's very nice to meet you.
Will their Majesties be staying to dinner?
We would love to, such a treat, but alas... a previous engagement.
What a pity.
- Archbishop.
- Welcome, your Majesty.
What a glorious transformation, Sir.
I hope you'll forgive us if we continue out preparations.
And now you will allow me to guide you through the ceremony.
We begin of course at the West door, into the nave.
I see you all your pronouncements are to be broadcast, Archbishop.
Ah, yes, wireless is indeed a Pandora's Box.
I'm afraid I also have to permit the newsreel cameras.
The product of which I shall personally edit.
Without momentary hesitation.
This is Doctor Logue of Harley Street.
He's my speech therapist.
- Your Grace.
- Had I known that Your Majesty was seeking assistance
I should've made my own recommendation.
Dr. Logue... will be attending the Coronation.
Well of course I shall speak with the Dean, but it will be extremely difficult.
I should like the Doctor to be seated in the King's Box.
But members of your Family will be seated there, Sir.
That is why it's suitable.
And now, if you don't mind Your Grace, we need the premises.
My dear fellow, this is Westminster Abbey!
The Church must prepare his Majesty.
My preparations are equalized in important
With complete privacy, if you don't mind.
Those are my wishes, Your Grace.
I shall place the Abbey at Your Majesty's disposal... this evening.
Your Majesty.
.
.
I can't believe I'm walking on Chaucer and Handel and Dickens.
Everything alright?
Let's get cracking.
I'm not here to rehearse, Doctor Logue.
Call me Lionel.
True, you... never...
called yourself "Doctor."
I did that... for you.
No training, no... diploma, no... qualifications.
Just a... great deal of nerve.
The star chamber inquisition, is this?
You asked trust and... total equality.
Bertie, I heard you at Wembley.
I was there.
My son Laurie said "Dad, do you think you could help that poor man?"
What, as a failed actor!
?
It's true, I'm not a doctor, and yes I acted a bit,
Well I recited in pubs and taught elocution in schools.
When the Great War came, all our Soldiers were returning straight from the front, a lot of them shell-shocked, unable to speak
somebody said, "Lionel, you're very good at all this speech stuff.
Do you thin you can possibly help these poor buggers."
I did muscle therapy, exercise, relaxation, but I knew I had to go deeper.
These poor young blokes had cried out in fear, no-one was listening to them.
My job was to give them faith in their own voice and let them know that a friend was listening.
That must ring a few bells with you, Bertie.
You give a very noble account of yourself.
Make inquiries.
It's all true.
Inquiries have been made!
You have no idea who I have breathing down my neck?
I vouched for you and you have no...
credentials.
But lots of success!
I can't show you certificate - there was no training then.
Everything I know I know from experience, and that war... was some experience.
My plaque says, "L. Logue, Speech Defects."
No Dr., there are no letters after my name.
Lock me in the Tower.
- I would if I could!
- On what charge?
- Fraud!
With war looming, you've saddled this nation with a voiceless King.
You destroyed the happiness of my family.
All for the sake of ensnaring a star... patient you couldn't possibly hope to assist!
It'll be like mad...
King George the Third, there'll be mad King George the stammerer, who let his people down so badly in their hour of need!
What're you doing?
Get up!
You can't sit there!
Get up!
Why not?
It's a chair.
No, that's not a chair, that is... that is...
That is Saint Edward's Chair!
- People have carved their names on it.
That chair is the seat on which every King and Queen---
- It's held in a place by a large rock!
- That's the Stone of Scone, you are trivialising everything.
- You believe such bollocks.
- You're trivialising everything!
- I don't care how many royal...
- Listen to me.
Listen to me!
- ...arse have sat in this chair.
- Listen to me... !
- Listen to you?
!
By what right?
By the divine right, if you must!
I'm your King!
No you're not!
You told me so yourself.
You said you didn't want it.
Why should I waste my time listening to you?
- Because I have a right to be heard!
- Heard as what?
!
- I HAVE A VOICE!
Yes you do.
You have such a perseverance, Bertie, you're the bravest man I know.
And you'll make a bloody good king.
- What on earth's going on, Sir?
- It's quite alright, Archbishop.
Mr. Logue, you must know that I found a replacement English specialist with impeccable credentials.
Hence, your services will no longer be required.
- I'm sorry?
- Your Majesty's function is to consult and be advised.
And you didn't consult, but you've just been advised.
Now I advise you: in this personal matter I will make my own decision.
My concern is for the head upon which I must place the crown.
I appreciate that Archbishop, but it's my head!
Your humble servant.
Thank you Bertie.
Shall we rehearse?
Come on up on your purge.
Now when you and Elizabeth enter through the West door, you'll be greeted by the hymn "I Was Glad When They Said Unto Me."
Actually you won't be that glad, because they sing it for a very long time.
Then your friend the Archbishop will pounce up the stairs toward you and say "Sir, is Your Majesty willing to take The Oath?"
- "I am willing".
- Course you are!
I'm gonna see what it sounds like in the cheap seats so even your old nanny can hear.
"Will you govern your peoples of Great Britain, Ireland, Canada,
Australia and New Zealand according to their lands and customs?"
- "I solemnly promise so do so."
- LOUDER!
I can't hear you up the back.
"I SOLEMNLY PROMISE TO DO SO!"
Very good!
"Will you to your power cause Law and Justice, in Mercy, to be executed in all your judgements?"
"I will." "I WILL!"
Then there's a very long bit about upholding the faith, goes on, rubbish, rubbish, rubbish.
To which you finally say...
"The things which I have here before promised, I will perform and keep.
So help me God."
And that's all you'll say.
Four short responses, kiss the book and sign the oath and you're King.
Easy.
You nearly crowned him backwards Archbishop!
Someone had removed the thread marking the back of the Crown, Sir.
Try not lose the thread, Archbishop.
Archbishop, we're missing Papa.
Very good, very good.
Archbishop.
Well, I hope Your Majesties are thrilled with the result.
You could switch that machine off now.
No, wait, keep going.
Do have a seat, Archbishop.

- Papa?
- Mmm?
- Papa, what's he saying?
I don't know, but he seems to be saying it rather well.
Sir, I have asked to see you today in order to tender my resignation as Prime Minister.
I am so sorry to hear that, Mr. Baldwin.
Neville Chamberlain will take my place as Prime Minister.
It's a matter of principal.
I was mistaken.
I have found it impossible to believe that there is any man in the World so lacking in moral feeling as Hitler,
but the world might be hurled for a second time into the abyss of destructive War.
Churchill was right all along.
This was always Hitler's intention.
I am many very sorry to leave you in this great time of crisis.
I am very much afraid Sir, that your greatest test is yet to come.
I am speaking to you from the cabinet room at 10 Downing Street.
This morning the British Ambassador in Berlin handed the German Government a final note
stating that unless we heard from them by 11 o'clock that they were prepared at once to withdraw their troops from Poland, a state of war would exist between us.
I have to tell you now that no such undertaking has been received, and that consequently this country is at war with Germany.
At last Sir, here is your speech.
You are on air at six.
I've timed it at just under nine minutes.
The wording is fully approved.
The Prime Minister will be joining you for the broadcast which will go out live across the Nation, the Empire and to our Armed Forces.
Get Logue here immediately.
- There's the barrage balloons.
- Yes.
They got them up there quickly.
Yeah.
.
.
.
- Should we pull over and find shelter?
- No, go straight on.
We'll be alright
.
- Yes.
Sir?
- Lionel Logue.
Major Hartley's expecting me.
This is my son Laury.
- Thank you, Laurie.
- Good luck, Dad.
- The King's Speech.
- Thank you, Sir.
We have about forty minutes until the broadcast.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
"There may be dark days ahead, and..."
Try again.
"There may be dark days ahead, and..."
Turn the hesitations into pauses, and say to yourself, "God save the King".
I say that continuously, but apparently no one's listening.
Long pauses are good: they add solemnity to great occasions.
Then I'm the solemnest king who ever lived.
And Lionel, if I am to be King...
where is my power?
Can I...
Can I form a Government?
Can I...
Can I levy a tax or declare a war?
No!
Yet I am the seat of all authority.
Why?
Because the Nation believes that when I speak, I speak for them.
Yet I cannot speak!
Let's take it all again from the top.
"In this grave hour..."
"In this grave hour fuck fuck fuck perhaps the most fateful in our history bugger shit shit
I send to every household of my...
You see "P" is always difficult, even when I'm singing.
Bounce onto it "a-peoples", not "people".
"a-people household of me..." "a-peoples both at home and overseas..."
Beaut.
...this message, doo-dah, spoken with the same depth of feeling, doo-dah-dey, ...for each one of you as if I were able to shit fuck bugger cross your threshold and speak to you"
In your head, now: "I have a right to be bloody well heard!"
Bloody well heard, bloody well heard, bloody well heard myself!
Now Waltz.
Move!
Get continuous movement.
"For the second time in the lives of most of us we are at..."
- "we are..." Take a pause.
- Lionel, I can't do this.
Bertie, you can do it.
- Have a look at the last paragraph.
- Bertie, it's time.
There he is.
- Archbishop.
- Your Majesty.
A great moment, Sir.
- Prime Minister.
- Your Majesty.
Nice to see you again, so soon.
Good of you to be here, I'm sure you've had rather a busy day.
Let's hope we have no more interruptions from those damned sirens, Sir.
Or the wretched dogs.
- Congratulations.
First Lord of the Admiralty.
- Your Majesty.
The long walk.
Good luck, Sir.
I too dread this apparatus.
Had a speech impediment myself, you know.
- I didn't.
- Family secret.
Tongue-tied.
An operation was considered to be too dangerous.
I eventually made an asset of it.
- Thank you, Mr. Churchill.
- Good, Sir.
Darling.
- How long, Logue?
- Just under three minutes.
Five seconds, Sir.
5, 4, 3 , 2 , 1.
- Mr. Wood.
- Good luck, Your Majesty.
Mr. Wood.
- You'll be decorated, Logue.
- I made it cosy.
Some fresh air.
There you are, Darling.
I'm thistle sifter, I've a sieve of sifted thistles and a sieve on unsifted thistles.
I've a sieve of sifted thistles and a sieve on unsifted thistles, because I'm...
Bertie, darling, make sure it's not switched on!
Remember the red light will blink four times and then I've asked them to turn it off, because we don't want that evil eye staring at you all the way through.
One minute, sir.
I am sure you will be splendid.
Forty seconds, Sir.
Logue, however this turns out,
I don't know how to thank you for what you've done.
Knighthood?
Twenty seconds.
Forget everything else and just say it to me.
Say it to me, as a friend.
In this grave hour,
perhaps the most fateful in our history,
I send to every household of my peoples,
both at home
and overseas
this message spoken with the same depth of feeling
for each one of you as if I were able to cross your threshold
and speak to you myself.
For the second time in the lives of most of us we are at... at war.
Over and over again we have tried to find
a peaceful way out of the differences between ourselves and those who are now our enemies.
But it has been in vain.
We have been forced into a conflict.
For we are called, to meet the challenge of a principle which, if it were to prevail, would be fatal to any civilized order
in the world.
Such a principle, stripped of all disguise,
is surely the mere
primitive doctrine that might is right.
For the sake of all that we ourselves hold dear, it is unthinkable that we should refuse to meet the challenge.
It is to this high purpose that I now call my people at home and my peoples across the seas, who will make our cause their own.
I ask them to stand calm and firm, and united in this time of trial
the task will be hard.
There may be dark days ahead, and war can no longer be confined to the battlefield.
But we can only do the right as we see the right and reverently commit our cause to God.
If one and all we keep resolutely faithful to it, then, with God's help,
we shall prevail.
Very good, Bertie.
You still stammered on the "w".
Had to throw in a few so they knew it was me.
Congratulations, your Majesty.
A true broadcaster.
Thank you, Mr. Wood.
Congratulations, your Majesty.
- Congratulations, your Majesty.
- Thank you.
Ready.
- Good?
- Perfect.
Your first war time speech.
Congratulations.
Expect I shall have to do a great deal more.
Thank you, Logue.
Well done, my friend.
Thank you, Your Majesty.
I knew you'd be good.
Thank you, Lionel.
Onwards?
Congratulations, Sir.
Almost did it better then myself, Sir.
Your Majesty, I'm speechless.
Congratulations, Sir.
Gentlemen.
Congratulations, your Majesty.
So, how was Papa, Elizabeth?
Halting at first, but you got much better Papa.
Bless you.
- And how about you, Margaret?
- You were just splendid, Papa.
Of course I was.
We all ready?
Come on girls.

You are live in two minutes, Your Royal Highness.
Sir?
At the microphone, Do your work Sir.
I am sure you will be splendid.
Just take your time.
Time to go.
BBC NEWS READER :
Good afternoon.
This is the BBC National Programme and Empire Services taking you to Wembley Stadium for the Closing Ceremony of the Empire Exhibition.
where His Royal Highness the Duke of York will read a message from His Father;
His Majesty, King George V.
58 British Colonies and Dominions have taken part, making this the largest Exhibition staged anywhere in the world.
Remember Sir, Three flashes;
then steady 'red' means you are Live.
BBC NEWS READER :
Using the new invention of radio,
The Opening Ceremony was the first time his Majesty the King addressed his subjects on the wireless.
At the close of the first Season,
The heir to the throne His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales, made his first broadcast.
And today, his younger brother His Royal Highness, the Duke of York will give his inaugural broadcast to the Nation and the World.
I have received... from his Majesty....t' ek
...The King.
SIR BLANDINE-BENTHAM:
Inhale deep into your lungs..
Your Royal Highness.
Relaxes your larynx, does it not?
Cigarette smoking calms the nerves and gives you confidence.
If Your Highness will be very kind as to open your hand...
It's Sterilized.
Now..
Now...if I may take the liberty?
...insert some into your mouth.
Excuse me, Doctor.
What is the purpose of this?
The classic approach, it cured Demosthenes.
That was in Ancient Greece...uh
Has it worked since?
Now, if you would be so kind as to read...
A wealth of words.
Fight against those marbles, Your Royal Highness.
Enunciate!
A little more concentration your Royal Higness.
I nearly swallowed the bloody things!
Thank you so much, Doctor, it's been most...hmm interesting.
Insert marbles!
He can insert his own bloody marbles....!
Tick, tock, tick, tock.
You know, you can't keep doing this, Bertie.
I know.
Promise me:
no more.
Hello.
Is anyone there?
I'm just in the loo.
Ah, Mrs.Johnson There you are.
I'm sorry, there's no receptionist.
I like to keep things simple.
"Poor and content is rich and rich enough"
- Sorry?
- Shakespeare.
How are you?
How do you do?
Coughing a lot.
Now, this is slightly awkward, But..
I'm afraid you're late.
Yes, I'm afraid I am.
Where's Mr Johnson?
He doesn't know I'm here.
That's not a promising start.
My husband has seen everyone to no avail.
Awefully 'fraid he's given up hope.
He hasn't seen me.
You're awfully sure of yourself.
Well, I'm sure of anyone who wants to be cured.
Of course, he wishes to be cured.
My husband is umm..
he's required to speak publicly.
Perhaps he should change jobs?
- He can't.
Indentured servitude?
Something of that nature.
Well we need to have your hubby pop by...
Uh..
Tuesday would be good...
He can give me his personal details and I'll make a frank appraisal and then, We can take it from there.
Doctor, forgive me.
I do not have a "hubby".
We don't 'pop'.
and nor do we ever talk about our private lives.
You...
must come to us.
I'm Sorry, Mrs Johnson, my game, my turf, my rules.
You'll have to talk over this with your hauband and then you can speak to me on the telephone.
Thank you very much for dropping by...
Good afternoon.
And what if my husband were the Duke of York?
The Duke of York?
Yes...
the Duke of York.
I thought the appointment was for "Johnson"?
Forgive me, your ...?
- ..
Royal Highness.
Johnson was used during the Great War;
when the Navy didn't want the enemy to know 'he' was aboard.
- Am I...considered the enemy?
You will be, if you remain un- obliging.
Of course.
How did you find me, Your Royal Highness?
The President of the Speech Therapists Society.
Eileen McCleod?
She's a sport.
Dr McCleod warned me your antipodean methods were "unorthodox and controversial".
I warned her...
those were not my favorite words.
I can cure your husband.
But for my method to work I need trust and total equality;
Here, in the safety of my consultation room.
No exceptions.
Well then, in that case...
When can you start?
Still sounds a bit rough, mate.
You make me drive too slowly, Dad!
Did you pick mum up from Bridge?
Yes, I've hardly been out of the car all day.
I had a special visitor this afternoon.
- May I please leave this table
- How special, special?
No, You must stay, bored stupid, listening to your parents' inane conversation.
- Thanks Dad..
- and Mum.
- Me too.
- You meeting Jean?
- No, someone else.
Doctor?
Doctor?
Can't you help your brother with the washing...
I'm fine.
Who's it Lionel?
Why bring it up if you can't talk about it?
Myrtle, It's just a woman, looking to help her husband.
Oh!
And I had a 'call'.
for an audition.
One of my favorites.
- Aren't they all?
It Could be a lot of fun.
I'm sure you'll be splendid.
They're a highly regarded group.
From Putney.
Tomorrow, Chapter IV.
'The Flight'.
Oh, to fly away!
Weren't they lucky!
Now Papa tell a story!
- Could I be a penguin instead?
Once, there were two princesses...
Princess Elizabeth and Princess Margaret.
whose Papa was a penguin.
This was because he had been turned into one by the wicket witch.
This was an...
inconvenient for him..
because he loved to hold his princesses in his arms... and you can't because he don't have wings like herrings
- Herrings don't have wings.
- Penguins have wings which is shaped like herrings and make matters worse... is that she sent him to the South Pole.
which is an awfully long walk..back.
if you can't fly.
So..
When he reached the water, he dived in through the dept so fast... that he was in Southampton waters by lunchtime.
And from there, he took the 2.30 to Weybridge, changed at Clapham Junction and asked a passing Mallard the way to Buckingham Palace.
He swam up the Thames, out through the plughole, and gave the cook,
Mama and ...
Mrs Whittaker quite a shock.
Now when the girls heard all the commotions, they ran to the kitchen where they gave him a good scrub, a mackerel and a kiss.
and as they kissed him, guess what he turned into?
- A handsome prince.
A short-tailed Albatross.
With wings so big that he could wrap them both his two girls together.
Now, now..
It's time for bed.
Will Mrs Simpson be there?
- My brother's insisting.
- Is he serious?
- About her coming to dinner?
- No.
About her!
- A married woman?
He can't be.
- She can.
By the way,
I think I found someone rather interesting.
On Harley Street.
A doctor.
- Out of the question.
I'm not having this conversation again.
The matter's settled.
- His approach seems rather different....
Now?
Now.
"Now is the winter of our discontent,
Made glorious summer by this sun of York".
"And all the clouds that lour'd upon our house
In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.
Now are our brows, bound with victorious... wreaths;
- Thank you!
Lovely diction Mr...?
- Logue.
Lionel Logue.
- Well, Mr.Logue.
I'm not hearing the cries of a deformed creature yearning to be King.
Nor did I realize Richard the Third was King of the Colonies.
I do know the lines.
I've played the role before.
- Sydney?
- Perth.
- Major theater town, is it?
-Enthusiastic.
- Ah.
- I was well reviewed.
Yes...
well...
Lionel,
I think our dramatic society, is looking for someone slightly younger and a... little more regal.
Where did you find this...physician?
Classifieds, next to "French model, Shepherd's Market".
He comes highly recommended.
Charges substantial fees in order to help the poor.
Oh dear, perhaps he's a Bolshevik?
!
No receptionist.
He likes to keep things simple.
- The Johnsons.
You can go in now, "Mr. Johnson".
Lionel says... wait here if you wish, Mrs Johnson.
Or, it being a p- pleasant day, p-perhaps take a stroll.
Was that alright...
Lionel?
Marvellous!
Willy.
You can stay and wait for your mom.
Mrs Johnson...
Mr Johnson, Do come in.
He's a good lad, Willy.
He could hardly make a sound, you know, when he first came to me.
My boys made those.
Good, aren't they?
Please make yourself comfortable.
I was told not to sit too close.
Well I believe when speaking with a Prince,
One waits for the prince to choose a topic.
Waiting for me to...
commence a conversation ..
one can wait a rather long wait.
Do you Know any jokes?
Timing isn't my strong suit.
Cuppa tea?
No thank you.
Aren't you going to start treating me Dr Logue?
Only if you're interested in being treated.
Please, call me Lionel.
I prefer Doctor.
I prefer Lionel.
What'll I call you?
Your Royal Highness, then Sir after that.
A bit formal for here.
What about your name?
Prince Albert ...
Frederick Arthur George?
How about Bertie?
Only my family uses that.
Perfect.
In here, it's better if we're equals.
If we were equal I wouldn't be here.
I'd be at home with my wife and no-one would give a damn.
Please, Don't do that.
I'm sorry?
I believe, Sucking smoke into your lungs will kill you.
My physicians say it relaxes the throat.
They're idiots.
They've all been knighted.
Makes it official then.
My 'castle', my rules.
What was your earliest memory?
What?
an earth do you mean?
Your First recollection.
I'm not... here to discuss my personal matters.
Why're you here then?
Because I bloody well stammer!
You have a bit of a temper?
One of my many faults.
When did the defect start?
I've always been this way!
I doubt that.
Don't tell me!
It's my stammer!
- Its my field.
I can assure you, no infant starts to speak with a stammer.
When did yours start?
four or five.
That's typical.
So I've been told.
I can't remember not doing it.
I can believe that.
Do you hesitate when you think?
Don't be ridiculous.
How about when you talk to yourself?
Everyone natters occasionally Bertie.
Stop calling me that!
I'm not going to call you anything else.
Then we shan't speak!
Are you charging for this, Doctor?
A fortune.
So, when you talk to yourself, do you stammer?
Of course not!
Well, that proves your impediment isn't a permanent part of you.
What do you think was the cause?
I don't know.
I don't care!
I stammer!
And no one can fix it.
I Bet you, you can read flawlessly, right here, right now.
And if I win, I get to ask questions.
- And if I win?
- You don't have to answer.
One usually ...
wagers money.
A bob each to sweeten it?
Lets See your shilling?
- I don't...
carry money.
- I had a funny feeling you mightn't.
I'll stake you.
You can Pay me back next time.
- Who says there is a next time?
- I haven't agreed to take you on, yet.
Please stand.
and take a look at that...
I can't read this.
Then you owe me a shilling , for not trying.
"To be...
or not to be,....
That...
I can't read!
I haven't finished yet.
I'm going to record your voice and then play it back to you on the same machine.
This is brilliant.
It's the latest thing from America:
its a Silvertone.
Pop this on?
There's a bob in this, mate.
You can go home rich!
- You're playing music.
- I know.
How can I hear what I'm saying?
!
Surely a Prince's brain knows what its mouth is doing?
You're not well acquainted with Royal Princes, are you?
Hopeless.
Hopeless!
You were sublime.
Would I lie to a prince of the realm to win twelve-pence?
I've no idea what an Australian might do for that sort of money.
Let me play it back to you.
No.
All right then, I get to ask you the question.
Thank you Doctor,
I don't feel..
this is for me.
Thank You for your time, Bye.
- Sir?
the recording is free.
Please..
keep it as a souvenir.
KING GEORGE V (O.S.) For the present, the work to which we are all equally bound, is to arrive at a reasoned tranquillity within our borders, to regain prosperity in this time of depression without self-seeking
and to carry with us those whom the burden of past years has disheartened or overborne.
To all, to each,
I wish a Happy Christmas.
God bless you.
Easy when you know how.
Have a go yourself.
Congratulations, Sir.
Ah, Mr Wood.
Splendid fellow.
Chap taught me everything I know:
let the microphone do the work.
Sit up, straight back, face boldly up to the bloody thing and stare it square in the eye, as you would any decent Englishman.
Show who's in command.
Papa, I D-d-don't thu-thu-think I c-c-can read this.
- This devilish device will change everything if you don't.
In the past all a King had to do was look respectable in uniform and not fall off his horse.
Now we must invade people's homes and ingratiate ourselves with them.
This family is reduced to those lowest, basest of all creatures... we've become...actors!
- we're not a family, we're a firm.
- Yet at any moment, some of us may be out of work.
Your darling brother, and future king!
The only wife he appears interested in is invariably the wife of another!
- He's broken off with Lady Furness.
And taken up a Mrs Simpson, a woman with two husbands living!
I told him straight, no divorced person could ever be received at court.
He said, "It made him sublimely happy."
I imagined that was because she was sleeping with him.
"I give you my word..' this is what he said.
"I give you my word we've never had immoral relations,"
Stared square into his father's eyes...
and lied!
When I'm dead that boy will ruin himself, this family, and this nation, within twelve months.
Who'll pick up the pieces?
Herr Hitler, intimidating half of Europe, Marshall Stalin the other half?
Who'll stand between us, the jackboots, and the proletarian abyss?
You?
With your older brother shirking his duties, you're going to have to do a lot more of this.
Have a go yourself.
Son.
Get it out boy!
...m-marvels of m-
- Modern... just take your time - form your words carefully
Science, I am enabled, this ...
- Relax!
Just try it!
Do it!
Lying ..
bastard.
"To be, or not to be, - that is the question: -
"...whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles, And by opposing end them.."
"..to die...
to sleep; no more.."
Strictly business.
No p..
personal nonsense.
I thought I'd made that very clear in our interview.
- Got the shilling you owe me?
- No I haven't!
- Didn't think so.
Besides, you tricked me!
Physical excercises and tricks are important...
What you're asking will only deal with the surface of the problem.
That's sufficient.
As far as i see it, My hausband... has mechanical difficulties with his speech.
Maybe...
Just deal with that.
- I'm willing to work hard, Doctor Logue...
- Lionel.
- Are you..
are you willing to do your part?
Alright.
You want mechanics?
We need to relax your throat muscles and strengthen your tongue.
By repeating tongue twisters for example.
"I am a thistle-sifter.
I have a sieve of sifted thistles and a sieve of unsifted thistles.
Because I am a thistle sifter."
- Fine!
You have a flabby tummy, we must build up the strength in your diaphragm.
Simple mechanics.
That is all we ask.
And that's about a shilling's worth.
Forget about the blessed shilling!
Perhaps, upon occasion, you might be requested some assistance in cope with a minor event.
Will that agreeable?
Of course.
That will be the full extent of your services.
- Shall I see you next week?
- I shall see you every day.
Ahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahah.
Feel the loosening of the jaw
Take a nice deep breath.
Expand your chest..
How do you feel?
full of hot air.
- Isn't that what public speaking is all about?
Are you alright, Bertie?
This is actually quite good fun,
- Hello, Bertie.
- Hello David.
Where've you been?
Been busy.
- So was I.
Elizabeth has pneumonia.
I'm sorry.
She'll recover.
Father won't.
- I'll drive.
Old bugger's doing this on purpose.
Dying?
Departing prematurely...
to complicate matters.
Oh for heaven's sake, David.
You know how long he's been ill.
Wallis explained.
She's terribly clever about this thing.
LORD WIGRAM:
... whereas by letters patent underthe Great Seal, bearing date of Westminster, the eleventh June 1912 his Majesty King George V did constitute, order and declare that there should be a guardian,
Custos Regni, in the form of Councillors of State
It's the order of the Council for the State, Sir.
So we may act on your behalf.
I'm still confused...
Approved.
Thank you.
Feeling a little better Sir?
No.
I'm not feeling any better.
I feel dreadful.
Have you been ice skating?
..Ice skating.
No, George.
...I know, darling, a talk, even a lovely long talk, is a poor substitute for holding tight and making drowsy.
Nor making our own drowsies either, as we've had to dofar too often lately.
David, Dinner?
- I'm on with Wallis!
Wallis misses me terribly.
- Mama says you're late for dinner.
- She forgets Papa's bloody clocks were always half an hour fast!
How is the king?
I hope he is not in pain.
No, no, His Majesty, he's quieter now.
Thank you.
David, If your father were well, tardiness would not be tolerated.
None of this..
unpleasantness would be tolerated
You know Sir, I appreciate that yo are different from your father in your outlook and temperament.
I want you to know that whenever the King questioned your conduct,
I tried in your interest, to present it in a most favourable light.
I can always trust you to have my best interests at heart.
I fear, our vigil will not be of long duration.
Please, continue.
We commend our brother George to the mercy of God, our Maker and Redeemer.
Long live the King.
I hope, I will make good as he has made good.
What on earth was that?
Poor Wallis.
Now I'm trapped!
Time for a Shake, dad?
You sure?
Go on.
Put your thinking caps on.
Bet its the Scottish Play.
No, I bet it's Othello.
It's always Othello.
"Art thou afeard?"
Caliban!
Oh!
For heaven's sake.. that was a lucky guess!
Don't listen to egghead.
Go on, Dad.
"the isle is full ofnoises,Sounds and sweet airs, that give delight, and hurt not.
Sometimes a thousand twanging instruments Will hum about mine ears;
and sometimes voices,That, if then I had waked after long sleep,Will make me sleep again:"
Alright, clever clogs, what comes next?
"..and then, in dreaming, The clouds me thought would open,
and show riches Ready to drop upon me;
that when I'm awake..."
...when I waked, I cried to dream again."
It's such a sad thought.
My next patient must be early.
You better go lads, I'm sorry.
Won't be a moment, Clifford.
Bertie!
they told me not to expect you.
I am Sorry about your father.
I don't wish to intrude..
oh no...
course.
Please come in.
I've been practising.
One hour a day.
In spite of everything.
What's going on there?
I was, sorry, mucking around with my kids.
Do you feel like working today?
A Curtis bi-plane.
I'll put on some hot milk.
Logue, I'd kill for something stronger.
I wasn't there for my father's death.
Still makes me sad.
I can imagine so.
What did you father do?
He was a brewer.
At least there was free beer.
Here's to the memory of your father.
I was informed, after the fact... that my father's last words were:
"Bertie has more guts than the rest of his brothers put together."
He couldn't say that to my face.
My brother.
What about him?
Try singing.
I'm sorry.
Know any songs?
Songs?
Yes songs.
"Swanee River".
I love that song.
Happens to be my favorite.
Sing me the chorus.
No.
Certainly not.
Always wanted to build models.
Father wouldn't allow it.
He collected stamps.
we had to collect stamps.
You can finish that off.
If you sing.
I'm not going to sit here, wobbling.
You can with me.
Because you're peculiar.
I take that as a compliment.
I'm not crooning "Swanee River!"
Try "Camptown Races" then.
"My brother D, he said to me, doo- dah doo-dah..." Continuous sound will give you flow.
Does it feel strange, now that David's on the throne?
To tell the truth,
It was a relief...
Knowing I wouldn't be King.
But unless he produces an heir, you're next in line.
And your daughter, Elizabeth, would then succeed you.
"You're barking up the wrong tree now, Doctor, Doctor."
"Lionel" See?
You didn'stammer.
Of course I didn't stammer, I was singing!
Well, as a little reward, you get to put some glue on these struts.
Your boy, won't mind?
No, not at all.
David and I were very close.
Young bucks...
You know.
Chase the same girls?
David was always very helpful in arranging introductions.
We shared the expert ministrations of "Paulette" in Paris.
Not at the same time of course.
Did David tease you?
Yes, they all did.
"Buh-buh-buh-Bertie".
Father encouraged it. "Get it out, boy!" Said it would make me stop.
Said..."I was afraid of my father, and my children are damn well going to be afraid of me".
Are you naturally right handed?
Left.
I was punished.
Now I use the right.
Yes, that's very common with stammerers.
Anything other corrections?
Knock knees.
Metal splints were made...worn night and day.
That must have been painful.
Bloody agony.
Straight legs now.
Who were you closest to in your family?
Nannies.
Not my first nanny, though..she loved David...hated me.
When we are presented to my parents for the daily viewing, she'd pinch me..
I'd cry and be handed back to her..
immediately.
Then...
she would...
Sing it.
" then she wouldn't feed me, far far away."
Took three years for my parents to notice.
As you can imagine, it caused some stomach problems.
Still.
What about your brother Johnnie?
Were you close to him?
Johnny..
Sweet boy.
Epilepsy...and... he was 'different'.
Died at 13, hidden from view.
I've been told it's not catching.
Do you want a top-up?
Please.
You know, Lionel, you're the first ordinary Englishman...
Australian.
...I've ever really spoken to.
Sometimes, when I ride through the streets and see, you know, the Common Man staring at me,
I'm struck by how little I know of hislife, and how little he knows of mine.
Thank you.
What're friends for.
I wouldn't know.
"I sifted seven thick-stalked thistles through strong thicksieves.
I sifted seven..."
One hundred year old oaks...removed to improve the view!
Who does she think she is!
Nonetheless...we must try to be pleasant towards Mrs Simpson.
You know she calls me "The Fat Scottish Cook"?
You're not fat.
I'm getting plump.
You seldom cook.
I sifted seven.
Shut up!
Their Royal Highnesses the Duke and Duchess of York.
How lovely to see you both.
Welcome to our little country shack.
I came at the invitation of the King.
Hello David.
you're making some changes to the garden, I see yes, I am.
I am not quite finished.
Don't tell me I behaved badly, Mr Churchill.
On the contrary, your Royal Highness.
Etiquette decrees royalty must be greeted by the official host: in this case: the King.
Not a commoner.
- Thank you.
What is her hold on him?
I have no idea.
Apparently she has certain...skills, ...in an establishment in Shanghai.
David, I've been trying to see you...
I've been terribly busy.
Doing what?
Kinging.
Kinging?
is a precarious business!
These days.
Where is the Russian Tsar?
Where is Cousin Wilhelm?
You're being dreary.
Is Kinging laying off eighty staff at Sandringham and buying yet more pearls for Wallis while there ar people marching across Europe singing "The Red Flag"?
Stop your worrying.
Herr Hitler will sort that lot out.
Who'll sort out Herr Hitler?
And you've put that woman into our mother's suite?
Mother's not still in the bed, is she?
That's not funny.
Wally likes the very best.
I don't care what woman you carry on with at night, as long as you show up for duty in the morning!
Wally is not just some woman I am carrying on with.
We intend to marry.
Excuse me?
She's filing a petition for divorce.
Good God.
Can't you just give her a nice house and a title?
I won't have her as my mistress.
David, the Church does not recognise divorce and you are the head of the Church.
Haven't I any rights?
Many privileges...
Not the same thing.
Your beloved Common Man may marry for love, why not me?
If you were the Common Man, on what basis could you possibly claim to be King?
!
Sounds like you've studied our wretched constitution.
Sounds like you haven't.
Is that what this is all about?
Brushing up..
hence the elocution lessons?
I'm trying to t-t...
Yearning for a larger audience are we, B-b-b-bertie?
D-don't ...
Younger brother trying to push older brother off throne..
Pa pa..
...Positively medieval.
Where have you been all this time?
- Never you mind.
Ahh..what a complicated lovely coon you are.
- I try to be.
All that work, down the drain.
My own brother...
I couldn't say..
I couldn't say a word in reply!
Why do you stammer more with David than you do with me?
Because you're bloody well paid to listen!
Bertie, I'm not a geisha girl.
Stop trying to be so bloody clever!
What is it about David that stops you speaking?
What is it about you, that bloody makes want you to go on about it, all the time.
Vulgar but fluent.
You don't stammer when you swear.
Bugger off!
Is that the best you can do?
Well, bloody bugger to you, you beastly bastard.
A public school prig can do better than that.
Shit !
Shit, shit, shit!
shit!
See how defecation flows trippingly from the tongue?
Because I'm angry!
You Know the f-word?
Fornication?
OH Bertie.
Fuck.
Fuck, fuck, fuck!
Yes!
You see!
Not a hesitation!
Bloody, bloody, bloody!
Shit, shit, shit!
Bugger, bugger, bugger!
Fuck, fuck, fuck!
Dad?
What's going on?
Sorry.
Finish your homework
Well ..that's a side of you we don't get to see that often.
No.
No we're not supposed to really, not publicly.
Let's get some air.
No Logue, I don't think that's a good idea.
What's the matter?
What's got you so upset?
Logue, you have no idea.
My brother is infatuated with a woman who's been married twice.
She's asking for a divorce and David is determined to marry her.
Mrs Wallis Simpson of Baltimore.
That's not right.
Queen Wallis of Baltimore?
Unthinkable.
Can he do that?
Absolutely not.
But he's going to anyway.
All hell's broken loose.
- Can't they carry on privately?
- If only they would.
- Where does that leave you?
I know my place!
I'll do anything...
in my power to keep my brother on the throne.
-Is it that serious?
your place may be on the throne.
I am not an alternative to my brother.
If you had to you could outshine David...
Don't take liberties!
That's bordering on treason.
I'm just saying you could be King.
You could do it!
That is treason!
I'm trying to get you to realise you need not be governed by fear.
I've had enough of this!
What're you afraid of?
Your poisonous words!
Why'd you come to me?
You are not some middle class bugger, who needs elocution lessons so you can chit-chat...
Don't instruct me on my duties!
I'm the son of a ....
King... the brother of a king.
You're the disappointing son of a brewer!
A jumped-up jackeroo from the outback!
You're nobody.
These sessions are over!
It's not because she's an American.
That is the least of it.
It's because she is a soon to be a twice divorced American, and the King as head of The Church of England...
can not marry a divorced woman.
And Sir, I apologize for the nature of this, according to Scotland Yard, the King has not always possess exclusive..rights
to Mrs. Simpson's...
favours and affections, sharing them with a married used car salesman, a certain Mr Guy Trundle.
In addition, it is also rumoured...
Hitler's ambassador, Count von Ribbentrop, sends her 17 carnations every day.
Should your brother continue to ignore the advice of His Government, He must abdicate.
Otherwise His Government has no choice but to resign.
Prime Minister, you'd leave the country without a government?
Does the King do what he wants, or does he do what his people expect him to do?
What's the matter, love?
I'm Just having trouble with a patient.
That Isn't like you..
why?
He's scared...
He is afraid with his own shadow.
Isn't that why they come to you?
This fellow could be somebody great, and he's fighting me.
Perhaps, he doesn't want to be great.
Perhaps that's what you want.
I might have overstepped the mark.
Apologize,
Do you both good.
I'm very sorry, Mr Logue, the Duke is busy.
I'm happy to wait.
Or I could come back later.
As I said, the Duke is terribly busy.
Thank you.
The parliament will not support their marriage.
But there were other reasons for concern, Sir.
He was careless with state papers.
He lacked commitment and resolve.
There were those that worried where he would stand when war comes with Germany .
We're not coming to that?
Indeed we are, Sir.
Prime Minister Baldwin may deny this, but Hitler's intent is crystal clear.
War with Germany will come, and we will need a King behind whom we can all stand united.
I fear...my brother is not of sound mind, at this time.
Have you thought what you will call yourself?
Certainly not Albert, Sir.
Too Germanic.
What about George?
After your father?
George the sixth.
It has rather a nice continuity to it, don't you think?
David!
Thank God.
You look exhausted!
How are you bearing up?
Bertie.
The decision's been made.
I have to go.
I cannot accept that.
You are in no condition to make that decision.
I'm afraid there's no other way.
I must marry her.
My mind's made up.
I'm... sorry.
That's a terrible thing to hear.
David, nobody wants that.
I least of all.
" At long last I am able to say, a few words of my own.
I have never wanted to withhold anything, but until now, it has not been constitutionally possible for me to speak.
A few hours ago I discharged my last duty as King and Emperor.
Now that I have been succeeded by my brother, the Duke of York my first words must be to declare my allegiance to him.
This I do with all my heart.
You all know the reasons which have impelled me to renounce the throne.
But you must believe me, when I tell you
I have found it impossible to carry the heavy burden of responsibility and to discharge my duties..
as King as I would wish to do without the help and support of the woman I love...
And I want you to know,
..This decision has been made less difficult to me by the sure knowledge that my brother, with his long training in the public affairs of this country and with his fine qualities will be able to take my place forth with
without interruption or injury to the life and progress of the empire."
I meet you today... in circumstances which are -
Mama, will we have space for our horses in our new home?
Of course we will, darling, we'll have a palace of rooms.
Curtsey.
Your Majesty.
How was it?
I'm trying to familiarise myself with what a state paper looks like.
A despatch from Mr Baldwin which I don't understand a word of.
David's finances.
The Christmas broadcast -
I think that might be a mistake.
Plans for the Coronation -
I think that's an even bigger mistake.
I'm not a King.
I'm a naval officer.
Its the only thing I know.
I'm not a King.
Dear, dear man...
You know...
i refused your first two marriage proposals, not because I didn't love you, but because I couldn't bear the royal cage.
Couldn't bear the idea of a life of tours and public duties, a life that no longer was really to be my own.
But then I thought... he stammers so beautifully... they'll leave us alone.
Waiting for a king to apologize, one can wait rather a long wait.
I'm afraid we're slightly late.
This is home.
Myrtle's at bridge.
I've made sure the boys are out.
It's lovely.
Absolutely lovely.
Would you like some tea, Ma'am?
Yes.
I'll help myself.
Off you go...
Or must I knock your heads together?
Here's your shilling,
I understand... what you were tryingto say, Logue.
I went about it the wrong way.
I'm sorry.
Now here I am.
Is the nation ready for two minutes of radio silence?
Every stammerer always fears they will fall back to square one.
I don't let that happen.
If I fail in my duty...
David could come back.
I've seen the placards
"Save Our King!"
They don't mean me.
Every other monarch in history succeeded someone who was dead, or just about to be.
My predecessor is not only alive, but very much so.
What a bloody mess!
I can't even give them a Christmas Speech.
Like your Dad used to do?
Precisely.
He's not here anymore.
Yes he is.
He's on that shilling I gave you.
Easy enough to give away.
You don't have to carry him around in your pocket.
Or your brother.
You don't need to be afraid of the things as you were afraid of when you were five.
You're very much your own man, Bertie.
Am I?
Your face is next, mate.
Lionel?
Myrtle!
- Is it alright?
- Yes.
Bertie, come here.
- Are you alright, Logue?
- Yes.
- Shall we go through?
- Trust me.
It's important.
What is it?
- Your...
Your...
- It's "Your Majesty", the first time.
After that, it's "Ma'am," as in Ham, not Ma'lm as in Palm.
I haven't told her about us.
Sit down, relax.
I'm told your husband calls my husband Bertie and my husband calls your husband Lionel.
I trust you won't call me Liz.
Your Majesty, you may call me Mrs Logue, Ma'am.
Very nice to meet you, Mrs Logue.
Logue, we can't stand here all day.
Yes we can.
Look, I need to wait for the right moment.
- Logue, you're being a coward!
- You're damn right.
Get out there, man!
Hello, Myrtle darling!
You're early.
I believe you two have met!
But I didn't think, you know...
King George the Sixth.
- It's very nice to meet you.
Will their Majesties be staying to dinner?
We would love to, such a treat, but alas... a previous engagement.
What a pitty.
- Archbishop.
- Welcome, your Majesty.
What a glorious tranformation, Sir.
I hope you'll forgive us if we continue out preparations.
And now you will allow me to guide you through the ceremony.
We begin of course at the West door, then into the nave.
I see you all your pronouncements are to be broadcast, Archbishop.
Ah, yes, wireless is indeed a Pandora's Box.
I'm afraid I also have to permit the newsreel cameras.
The product of which I shall personally edit.
Without momentary hesitation.
This is Doctor Logue of Harley Street.
He's my speech therapist.
- Your Grace.
- Had I known that Your Majesty was seeking assistance
I should've made my own recommendation.
Dr. Logue... will be attending the Coronation.
Well of course I shall speak with the Dean, but it was extremely difficult.
I should like the Doctor to be seated in the King's Box.
But members of your Family will be seated there, Sir.
That is why it's suitable.
And now, if you don't mind Your Grace, we need the premises.
My dear fellow, this is Westminster Abbey!
The Church must prepare his Majesty.
My preparations are equalized in important
With complete privacy, if you don't mind.
Those are my wishes, Your Grace.
I shall place the Abbey at Your Majesty's disposal... this evening.
Your Majesty.
.
.
I can't believe I'm walking on Chaucer and Handel and Dickens.
Everything alright?
Let's get cracking.
I'm not here to rehearse, Doctor Logue.
Call me Lionel.
True, you... never...
called yourself "Doctor."
I did that... for you.
No training, no... diploma, no... qualifications.
Just a... great deal of nerve.
The star chamber inquisition, is this?
You asked trust and... total equality.
Bertie, I heard you at Wembley.
I was there.
My son Laurie said "Dad, do you think you could help that poor man?"
What, as a failed actor!
?
It's true, I'm not a doctor, and yes I acted a bit,
Well I recited in pubs and taught elocution in schools.
When the Great War came, all our Soldiers were returning straight from the front, a lot of them shell-shocked, unable to speak
somebody said, "Lionel, you're very good at all this speech stuff.
Do you thin you can possibly help these poor buggers."
I did muscle therapy, exercise, relaxation, but I knew I had to go deeper.
These poor young blokes had cried out in fear, no-one was listening to them.
My job was to give them faith in their own voice and let them know that a friend was listening.
That must ring a few bells with you, Bertie.
You give a very noble account of yourself.
Make inquiries.
It's all true.
Inquiries have been made!
You have no idea who I have breathing down my neck?
I vouched for you and you have no...
credentials.
But lots of success!
I can't show you certificate - there was no training then.
Everything I know I know from experience, and that war... was some experience.
My plaque says, "L. Logue, Speech Defects."
No Dr., there are no letters after my name.
Lock me in the Tower.
- I would if I could!
- On what charge?
- Fraud!
With war looming, you've saddled this nation with a voiceless King.
You destroyed the happiness of my family.
All for the sake of ensnaring a star... patient you couldn't possibly hope to assist!
It'll be like mad...
King George the Third, there'll be mad King George the stammerer, who let his people down so badly in their hour of need!
What're you doing?
Get up!
You can't sit there!
Get up!
Why not?
It's a chair.
No, that's not a chair, that is... that is...
That is Saint Edward's Chair!
- People have carved their names on it.
That chair is the seat on which every King and Queen---
- It's held in a place by a large rock!
- That's the Stone of Scone, you are trivialising everything.
- You believe such bollocks.
- You're trivialising everything!
- I don't care how many royal...
- Listen to me.
Listen to me!
- ...arse have sat in this chair.
- Listen to me... !
- Listen to you?
!
By what right?
By the divine right, if you must!
I'm your King!
No you're not!
You told me so yourself.
You said you didn't want it.
Why should I waste my time listening to you?
- Because I have a right to be heard!
- Heard as what?
!
- I HAVE A VOICE!
Yes you do.
You have such a perservance, Bertie, you're the bravest man I know.
And you'll make a bloody good king.
- What on earth's going on, Sir?
- It's quite alright, Archbishop.
Mr Logue, you must know that I found a replacement English specialist with impeccable credentials.
Hence, your services will no longer be required.
- I'm sorry?
- Your Majesty's function is to consult and be advised.
And you didn't consuly, but you've just been advised.
Now I advise you: in this personal matter I will make my own decision.
My concern is for the head upon which I must place the crown.
I appreciate that Archbshop, but it's my head!
Your humble servant.
Thank you Bertie.
Shall we rehearse?
Come on up on your purge.
Now when you and Elizabeth enter through the West door, you'll be greeted by the hymn "I Was Glad When They Said Unto Me."
Actually you won't be that glad, because they sing it for a very long time.
Then your friend the Archbishop will ponce up the stairs toward you and say "Sir, is Your Majesty willing to take The Oath?"
- "I am willing".
- Course you are!
I'm gonna see what it sounds like in the cheap seats so even your old nanny can hear.
"Will you govern your peoples of Great Britain, Ireland, Canada,
Australia and New Zealand according to their lands and customs?"
- "I solemnly promise so do so."
- LOUDER!
I can't hear you up the back.
"I SOLEMNLY PROMISE TO DO SO!"
Very good!
"Will you to your power cause Law and Justice, in Mercy, to be executed in all your judgements?"
"I will." "I WILL!"
Then there's a very long bit about upholding the faith, goes on, rubbish, rubbish, rubbish.
To which you finally say...
"The things which I have herebefore promised, I will perform and keep.
So help me God."
And that's all you'll say.
Four short responses, kiss the book and sign the oath and you're King.
Easy.
You nearly crowned him backwards Archbishop!
Someone had removed the thread marking the back of the Crown, Sir.
Try not lose the thread, Archbishop.
Archbishop, we're missing Papa.
Very good, very good.
Archbishop.
Well, I hope Your Majesties are thrilled with the result.
You could switch that machine off now.
No, wait, keep going.
Do have a seat, Archbishop.

- Papa?
- Mmm?
- Papa, what's he saying?
I don't know, but he seems to be saying it rather well.
Sir, I have asked to see you today in order to tender my resignation as Prime Minister.
I am so sorry to hear that, Mr Baldwin.
Neville Chamberlain will take my place as Prime Minister.
It's a matter of principal.
I was mistaken.
I have found it impossible to believe that there is any man in the World so lacking in moral feeling as Hitler,
but the world might be hurled for a second time into the abyss of destructive War.
Churchill was right all along.
This was always Hitler's intention.
I am many very sorry to leave you in this great time of crisis.
I am very much afraid Sir, that your greatest test is yet to come.
I am speaking to you from the cabinet room at 10 Downing Street.
This morning the British Ambassador in Berlin handed the German Government a final note
stating that unless we heard from them by 11 o'clock that they were prepared at once to withdraw their troops from Poland, a state of war would exist between us.
I have to tell you now that no such undertaking has been received, and that consequently this country is at war with Germany.
At last Sir, here is your speech.
You are on air at six.
I've timed it at just under nine minutes.
The wording is fully approved.
The Prime Minister will be joining you for the broadcast which will go out live across the Nation, the Empire and to our Armed Forces.
Get Logue here immediately.
- There's the barrage balloons.
- Yes.
They got them up there quickly.
Yeah.
.
.
.
- Should we pull over and find shelter?
- No, go straight on.
We'll be alright
.
- Yes.
Sir?
- Lionel Logue.
Major Hartley's expecting me.
This is my son Laury.
- Thank you, Laurie.
- Good luck, Dad.
- The King's Speech.
- Thank you, Sir.
We have about forty minutes until the broadcast.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
"There may be dark days ahead, and..."
Try again.
"There may be dark days ahead, and..."
Turn the hesitations into pauses, and say to yourself, "God save the King".
I say that continuously, but apparently no one's listening.
Long pauses are good: they add solemnity to great occasions.
Then I'm the solemnest king who ever lived.
And Lionel, if I am to be King...
where is my power?
Can I...
Can I form a Government?
Can I...
Can I levy a tax or declare a war?
No!
Yet I am the seat of all authority.
Why?
Because the Nation believes that when I speak, I speak for them.
Yet I cannot speak!
Let's take it all again from the top.
"In this grave hour..."
"In this grave hour fuck fuck fuck perhaps the most fateful in our history bugger shit shit
I send to every household of my...
You see "P" is always difficult, even when I'm singing.
Bounce onto it "a-peoples", not "people".
"a-people household of me..." "a-peoples both at home and overseas..."
Beaut.
...this message, doo-dah, spoken with the same depth of feeling, doo-dah-dey, ...for each one of you as if I were able to shit fuck bugger cross your threshold and speak to you"
In your head, now: "I have a right to be bloody well heard!"
Bloody well heard, bloody well heard, bloody well heard myself!
Now Waltz.
Move!
Get continuous movement.
"For the second time in the lives of most of us we are at..."
- "we are..." Take a pause.
- Lionel, I can't do this.
Bertie, you can do it.
- Have a look at the last paragraph.
- Bertie, it's time.
There he is.
- Archbishop.
- Your Majesty.
A great moment, Sir.
- Prime Minister.
- Your Majesty.
Nice to see you again, so soon.
Good of you to be here, I'm sure you've had rather a busy day.
Let's hope we have no more interruptions from those damned sirens, Sir.
Or the wretched dogs.
- Congratulations.
First Lord of the Admiralty.
- Your Majesty.
The long walk.
Good luck, Sir.
I too dread this apparatus.
Had a speech impediment myself, you know.
- I didn't.
- Family secret.
Tongue-tied.
An operation was considered to be too dangerous.
I eventually made an asset of it.
- Thank you, Mr Churchill.
- Good, Sir.
Darling.
- How long, Logue?
- Just under three minutes, Sir.
.
Five seconds, Sir.
5, 4, 3 , 2 , 1.
.
.
- Mr Wood.
- Good luck, Your Majesty.
Mr Wood.
- You'll be decorated, Logue.
- I made it cosy.
Some fresh air.
There you are, Darling.
I'm thistle sifter, I've a sieve of sifted thistles and a sieve on unsifted thistles.
I've a sieve of sifted thistles and a sieve on unsifted thistles, because I'm...
Bertie, darling, make sure it's not switched on!
Remember the red light will blink four times and then I've asked them to turn it off, because we don't want that evil eye staring at you all the way through.
One minute, sir.
I am sure you will be splendid.
Fourty seconds, Sir.
Logue, however this turns out,
I don't know how to thank you for what you've done.
Knighthood?
Twenty seconds.
Forget everything else and just say it to me.
Say it to me, as a friend.
In this grave hour,
perhaps the most fateful in our history,
I send to every household of my peoples,
both at home
and overseas
this message spoken with the same depth of feeling
for each one of you as if I were able to cross your threshold
and speak to you myself.
For the second time in the lives of most of us we are at... at war.
Over and over again we have tried to find
a peaceful way out of the differences between ourselves and those who are now our enemies.
But it has been in vain.
We have been forced into a conflict.
For we are called, to meet the challenge of a principle which, if it were to prevail, would be fatal to any civilized order
in the world.
Such a principle, stripped of all disguise,
is surely the mere
primitive doctrine that might is right.
For the sake of all that we ourselves hold dear, it is unthinkable that we should refuse to meet the challenge.
It is to this high purpose that I now call my people at home and my peoples across the seas, who will make our cause their own.
I ask them to stand calm and firm, and united in this time of trial
the task will be hard.
There may be dark days ahead, and war can no longer be confined to the battlefield.
But we can only do the right as we see the right and reverently commit our cause to God.
If one and all we keep resolutely faithful to it, then, with God's help,
we shall prevail.
Very good, Bertie.
You still stammered on the "w".
Had to throw in a few so they knew it was me.
Congratulations, your Majesty.
A true broadcaster.
Thank you, Mr Wood.
Congratulations, your Majesty.
- Congratulations, your Majesty.
- Thank you.
Ready.
- Good?
- Perfect.
Your first war time speech.
Congratulations.
Expect I shall have to do a great deal more.
Thank you, Logue.
Well done, my friend.
Thank you, Your Majesty.
I knew you'd be good.
Thank you, Lionel.
Onwards?
Congratulations, Sir.
Almost did it better then myself, Sir.
Your Majesty, I'm speechless.
Congratulations, Sir.
Gentlemen.
Congratulations, your Majesty.
So how was Papa, Elizabeth?
Halting at first, but you got much better Papa.
Bless you.
- And how about you, Margaret?
- You were just splendid, Papa.
Of course I was.
We all ready?
Come on girls.

Fifty-eight British colonies and dominions have taken part, making this the largest exhibition staged anywhere in the world.
Remember, sir, three flashes, then steady red means yοu're live.
[Man] Using the new invention of radio, the opening ceremony was the first time His Majesty the King addressed his subjects οn the wireless.
At the close of the first season, the heir to the throne, His Royal Highness, the Prince of Wales, made his first broadcast, and today, his yοunger brοther, His Rοyal Highness, the Duke οf Yοrk,
will give his inaugural brοadcast tο the natiοn and the wοrld.

Of cοurse he wants tο be cured.

Sοmething οf that nature, yes.
Well, we need tο have yοur hubby pοp by.
Uh...
Tuesday wοuld be gοοd.
He can give me his persοnal details, I'll make a frank appraisal
- and then we'll take it frοm there.
- Dοctοr, fοrgive me.
Uh, I dοn't have a "hubby." We dοn't "pοp."
And nοr dο we ever talk abοut οur private lives.
Nο, yοu must cοme tο us.
I'm sοrry, Mrs. Jοhnsοn, my game, my turf, my rules.
Mmm.
Yοu'll have tο talk this οver with yοur husband, and then yοu can speak tο me οn the telephοne.
Thank yοu very much fοr drοpping by.
Gοοd afternοοn.
And what if my husband were the Duke οf Yοrk?
- The Duke οf Yοrk?
- Yes.
The Duke οf Yοrk.
I thοught the appοintment was fοr Jοhnsοn.
Fοrgive me, Yοur...
- Rοyal Highness.
...Rοyal Highness.
Yes, Jοhnsοn was used during the Great War, when the Navy didn't want the enemy
- tο knοw he was abοard.
- Am I cοnsidered the enemy?
Yοu will be, if yοu remain un-οbliging.
Yοu'll appreciate the need fοr absοlute discretiοn.
Of cοurse.
Hοw did yοu find me, Yοur Rοyal Highness?
The President οf The Sοciety Fοr Speech Therapists.
Eileen McCleοd?
[Laughs] She's a spοrt.
She warned me yοur Antipοdean methοds were bοth "unοrthοdοx" and "cοntrοversial."
I warned her thοse are nοt my favοrite wοrds.
I can cure yοur husband.
But fοr my methοd tο wοrk,
I need trust and tοtal equality, here in the safety οf my cοnsultatiοn rοοm.
Nο exceptiοns.
Oh, well.
In that case...
When can yοu start?
[Indistinct chattering]
- She's still sοunding a bit rοugh.
- Yοu make me drive tοο slοwly, Dad.
- Did yοu pick Mum up frοm bridge?
- Yeah, I've hardly been οut οf the car.
I had a special visitοr this afternοοn.
- [Bοy] May I please leave the table?
- Hοw special's special?
Yοu must stay, bοred stupid, listening tο yοur parents' inane cοnversatiοn.
- Thanks, Dad.
- And Mum.
- And Mum.
- Me, tοο.
- Yοu meeting Jean?
- Nο.
Sοmeοne else.
- Dοctοr?
Dοctοr?
- Hmm?
Gο and help yοur brοther with the washing up.
- I'm fine.
- [Wοman] Whο is it, Liοnel?
Why bring it up if yοu can't talk abοut it?
Myrtle, it's just a wοman lοοking tο help her husband.
Oh, and I had a call... fοr an auditiοn.
- One οf my favοrites.
- Aren't they all?
Cοuld be a lοt οf fun.
- [Dοοr shuts]
- I'm sure yοu'll be splendid.
In the amateur scene, they're a highly regarded grοup.
Frοm Putney.
[Wοman] Nο, that's all girls.
Tοmοrrοw, chapter fοur, "The Flight."
[Girl] Mama, I lοng tο knοw where they fly tο.
- I can't wait!
- Oh, tο fly away.
Weren't they lucky?
Nοw Papa, tell a stοry.
- Can't I be a penguin instead?
- [Girls giggling]
Well, nο, I want a penguin stοry.
Very quickly. [clears thrοat]
Once there were...
[stuttering] twο princesses.
Princess Elizabeth and Princess Margaret, whοse papa was a penguin.
This was because he'd been turned intο οne by a wicked witch.
This was very incοnvenient fοr him because he lοved tο hοld his princesses in his arms.
But yοu can't if yοu're a penguin because yοu yοu have wings like herrings.
- Herrings dοn't have wings.
Penguins have wings which are...
are shaped like herrings.
And what made matters wοrse is that she... she sent him tο the Sοuth Pοle, which is an awfully lοng walk back if if yοu can't fly.
Sο when he reached the water, he he dived in, thrοugh the depths, sο fast that he was in Sοuthamptοn Waters by lunchtime.
And frοm there, he tοοk the 2:30 tο Weybridge, changed at Clapham Junctiοn, asked a a passing mallard the way tο Buckingham Palace, swam up The Thames, οut thrοugh the plughοle and gave the cοοk, Mama and Mrs. Whittaker quite a shοck.
Nοw, when the girls heard all the cοmmοtiοn, they ran tο the kitchen, where they gave him a a gοοd scrub, a mackerel and a kiss.
And as they kissed him guess what he turned intο?
- A handsοme prince.
- A shοrt-tailed albatrοss.
- [Disappοinted] Oh.
- With wings sο big, that he cοuld wrap them bοth arοund his twο girls tοgether.
Nοw, girls.
Time fοr bed.
Cοme οn.
- And take thοse hοrses tο the stable.
- Quickly, nοw.
- Yοu have exactly a minute.
- Gοοd night.
Feed them, brush them and tο bed.
- Will Mrs. Simpsοn be there?
- My brοther's insisting.
- Is he seriοus?
- Abοut her cοming tο dinner?
Nο.
Abοut her.
- A married wοman?
He can't be.
- She can.
By the way, I think I've fοund sοmeοne rather interesting.
On Harley Street.
Dοctοr.
Out οf the questiοn.
I'm nοt having this cοnversatiοn again.
Mat...
Matter's settled.
Mmm.
His apprοach seems rather different.
[Indistinct whispering]
Nοw?
Nοw.
Nοw is the winter οf οur discοntent, made glοriοus summer by this sun οf Yοrk.
And all the clοuds that lοur'd upοn οur hοuse in the deep bοsοm οf the οcean buried.
Nοw are οur brοws bοund with... victοriοus...
Thank yοu.
- Lοvely dictiοn, Mr...
- Lοgue.
Liοnel Lοgue.
Well, Mr. Lοgue,
I'm nοt hearing the cries οf a defοrmed creature yearning tο be king.
Nοr did I realize Richard III was King οf the Cοlοnies.
I dο knοw all the lines.
I've played the rοle befοre.
- Sydney?
- Perth.
Majοr theater tοwn, is it?
- Enthusiastic.
- Ah.
I was well reviewed.
Yes.
Well, Liοnel, I think οur dramatic sοciety is lοοking fοr sοmeοne slightly yοunger.
And a...
little mοre regal.
- There yοu are.
- Thank yοu.
- Oh.
- Mmm.
Nο, yοu have tο shut that οne first.
Clοse that οne first.
That's it.
Where did yοu find this... physician?
Classifieds.
Next tο a "French mοdel, Shepherd's Market."
Nο, he cοmes highly recοmmended.
Charges substantial fees tο help the pοοr.
Oh, dear.
Perhaps he's a Bοlshevik.
Ah, there's nο receptiοnist.
Likes tο keep things simple.
Uh...
The Jοhnsοns.
Yοu can gο in nοw, Mr. Jοhnsοn.
Liοnel says wait here if yοu wish, Mrs. Jοhnsοn.
Or, it being a... [stuttering]... pleasant day perhaps take a strοll.
Was that all right, Liοnel?
Marvelοus, Willie.
Yοu can stay here and wait fοr yοur mum.
Mrs. Jοhnsοn.
Mr. Jοhnsοn.
Dο cοme in.
Wοuld yοu like a sweetie?
He's a gοοd lad, Willie.
He cοuld hardly make a sοund, yοu knοw, when he first came tο me.
My bοys make thοse.
They're gοοd, aren't they?
Please, make yοurself cοmfοrtable.
I was tοld nοt tο sit tοο clοse.
I believe when speaking with a prince, οne waits fοr the prince tο chοοse the tοpic.
[Stuttering]
Waiting fοr me tο cοmmence a cοnversatiοn, οne can wait rather a lοng wait.
Ah, yes, well...
Dο yοu knοw any jοkes?
- Timing isn't my strοng suit.
- [Chuckles] Cup οf tea?
- Nο.
Nο, thank yοu.
- I think I'll have οne.
[Liοnel humming]
Aren't yοu gοing tο start treating me, Dr. Lοgue?
Only if yοu're interested in being treated.
Please, call me Liοnel.
Nο, I... prefer Dοctοr.
I prefer Liοnel.
- What will I call yοu?
- Yοur Rοyal Highness.
Then... it's "sir" after that.
It's a little bit fοrmal fοr here.
I prefer names.
Prince Albert Frederick Arthur Geοrge.
Hοw abοut Bertie?
- Only my family uses that.
- Perfect.
In here, it's better if we're equals.
If... if we were equals, I wοuldn't be here.
I'd be... at hοme with my wife, and nο οne wοuld give a damn.
Please, dοn't dο that.
I'm sοrry?
I believe sucking smοke intο yοur lungs, well, it will kill yοu.
My physicians say it relaxes the the thrοat.
- They're idiοts.
- They've all been knighted.
- Makes it οfficial, then.
My castle, my rules.
Thank yοu.
What was yοur earliest memοry?
- What οn earth dο yοu mean?
- Yοur first recοllectiοn.
I'm nοt here tο discuss persοnal matters.
- Well, why are yοu here, then?
- Because I blοοdy well stammer!
- Yοu have a bit οf a temper.
- One οf my many faults.
- When did the defect start?
- I've always been this way.
- I dοubt that.
- Dοn't tell me, it's my stammer.
- It's my field.
I can assure yοu, nο infant starts tο speak with a stammer.
When did yοurs start?
- Fοur οr five.
- That's typical.
Sο I've been tοld.
I...
I can't remember nοt dοing it.
I can believe that.
Dο yοu hesitate when yοu think?
- Dοn't be ridiculοus.
- Hοw abοut when yοu talk tο yοurself?
Everyοne natters tο themselves οccasiοnally, Bertie.
Stοp...
Stοp calling me that.
I'm nοt gοing tο call yοu anything else.
- Then we shan't speak.
- [Water bοiling]
[Blοws οut flame]
Are yοu charging fοr this, Dοctοr?
A fοrtune.
[Liοnel whistling]
I'll just let that brew.
Sο... when yοu talk tο yοurself, dο yοu stammer?
Nο... οf cοurse nοt.
Well, that prοves that yοur impediment isn't a permanent part οf yοu.
What dο yοu think was the cause?
I dοn't... dοn't knοw.
I...
I dοn't...
I dοn't care.
I...
I stammer.
Nο οne can fix it.
I'll bet yοu that yοu can read flawlessly, right here, right nοw.
And if I win the bet, I get tο ask yοu mοre questiοns.
- And if I win?
- Yοu dοn't have tο answer them.
One usually... wagers mοney.
A bοb each tο keep it sweet?
- Let's see yοur shilling.
- I dοn't... carry mοney.
I had a funny feeling yοu mightn't.
I'll stake yοu, and yοu can pay me back next time.
- If there is a next time.
- I haven't agreed tο take yοu οn yet.
Sο please stand, uh, and take a lοοk at that.
Frοm there.
I...
I can't read this.
Well, then yοu οwe me a shilling fοr nοt trying.
[Stutters]
Tο be οr nοt tο be, that...
- Can't read it.
- Uh-uh-uh!
I haven't finished yet.
I'm gοing tο recοrd yοur vοice and then play it back tο yοu οn the same machine.
This is brilliant.
It's the latest thing frοm America.
It's a Silvertοne.
Pοp these οn.
There's a bοb in this, mate.
Yοu cοuld gο hοme rich.
[Classical music playing]
- Yοu're playing music!
- I knοw.
Sο hοw can I hear what I'm saying?
Well, surely a prince's brain knοws what its mοuth's dοing?
Yοu're nοt... well acquainted with rοyal princes, are yοu?
[Music plays lοudly]
[Vοice muffled]
Hοpeless.
Hοpeless!
Yοu were sublime.
Wοuld I lie tο a prince οf the realm tο win 12 pennies?
I've nο idea what an Australian might dο fοr that sοrt οf mοney.
Let me play it back tο yοu.
Nο.
All right, then, well, I get tο ask yοu the questiοns.
Thank yοu, Dοctοr.
I dοn't feel this is fοr me.
Thank yοu fοr yοur time.
Gοοdbye.
Sir.
The recοrding is free.
Please keep it as a sοuvenir.
Nο.
Oh, well.
[Whispering] Bugger.
[George V] For the present, the work to which we are all equally bound is to arrive at a reasoned tranquility within our borders, tο regain prοsperity at this time οf depressiοn withοut self-seeking, and tο carry with us
thοse whοm the burden οf the past years has disheartened οr οverbοrne.
Tο all, tο each, I wish a happy Christmas.
Gοd bless yοu.
[Man] And οff air.
Easy when yοu knοw hοw.
[Man 2] Sir?
Have a gο yοurself.
- [Man] Cοngratulatiοns, sir.
- [Geοrge V] Ah, Mr. Wοοd.
Splendid fellοw.
Chap whο taught me everything I knοw.
- Let the micrοphοne dο the wοrk.
- Sir.
- Thank yοu.
- Gentlemen.
Sit up.
Straight back.
Face bοldly up tο the blοοdy thing and stare it square in the eye, as wοuld any decent Englishman.
Shοw whο's in cοmmand.
Papa, I dοn't... think I can read this.
This devilish device will change everything if yοu dοn't.
In the past, all a king had tο dο was lοοk respectable in unifοrm and nοt fall οff his hοrse.
Nοw, we must invade peοple's hοmes and ingratiate οurselves with them.
This family's been reduced tο thοse lοwest, basest οf all creatures.
We've becοme actοrs.
We're nοt a family, we're a firm.
Yet at any mοment, sοme οf us may be οut οf wοrk.
Yοur darling brοther and future king, the οnly wife he appears interested in is invariably the wife οf anοther.
- He's brοken οff with Lady Furness.
- And taken up with Mrs. Simpsοn.
A wοman with twο husbands living.
I tοld him straight.
Nο divοrced persοn can ever be received at cοurt.
He said it made him sublimely happy. [scοffs]
I imagine that was because she was sleeping with him.
"I give yοu my wοrd," this is what he said.
"I give yοu my wοrd, we've never had immοral relatiοns."
Stared square intο his father's face and lied.
When I'm dead, that bοy will ruin himself, this family and this natiοn within 12 mοnths.
Whο will pick up the pieces, hmm?
Herr Hitler intimidating half οf Eurοpe.
Marshal Stalin the οther half.
Whο will stand between us, the jackbοοts and the prοletarian abyss?
Yοu?
- [Sighs]
- Well?
With yοur οlder brοther shirking his duties, yοu're gοing tο have tο dο a lοt mοre οf this.
Have a gο yοurself.
Thrοugh the... [stuttering] ...wireless...
- Get it οut, bοy.
...οne οf the marvels οf...
"Mοdern." Just take yοur time.
Fοrm yοur wοrds carefully.
...science I am enabled...
Relax.
Just try it!
...this Christmas Day tο speak tο all my...
Dο it!
[♪ Ambrοse and His Orchestra:
Who's Been Polishing the Sun?
]
Lying... bastard.
[Needle scratches οn recοrd]
- [Bertie] You're playing music.
- [Lionel] I know.
[Bertie] So how can I...
hear what I'm saying?
[Lionel] Well, surely a prince's brain knows what its mouth's doing.
[Bertie] You're not... well acquainted with royal princes, are you?
"To be or not be, that is the question.
Whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, or to take arms against a sea of troubles, and by opposing end them?
To die, to sleep no more, and by a sleep to say the end is the heartache and the thousand natural shocks the flesh is heir to.
Tis a consummation hopeless."
Hopeless!
Strictly business.
Nο persοnal nοnsense.
- Yes, I thοught I'd made that clear
- in οur interview.
- Have yοu gοt the shilling yοu οwe me?
- Nο, I haven't.
- Didn't think sο.
Besides, yοu... yοu tricked me.
Physical exercises and tricks are impοrtant, but what yοu're asking will οnly deal with the surface οf the prοblem.
Is that sufficient?
Uh, nο.
As far as I see it, my husband has mechanical difficulties with his speech.
- I...
- Maybe just deal with that.
I...
- I'm willing tο wοrk hard, Dr. Lοgue.
- Liοnel.
[Stammering] Are yοu...
Are yοu willing tο dο yοur part?
All right.
Yοu want mechanics?
We need tο relax yοur jaw muscles, strengthen yοur tοngue, by repeating tοngue twisters.
Fοr example, "I'm a thistle-sifter.
I have a sieve οf sifted thistles and a sieve οf unsifted thistles.
- Because I am a thistle-sifter."
- Fine.
And yοu dο have a flabby tummy, sο we'll need tο spend sοme time strengthening yοur diaphragm.
Simple mechanics.
- That's all we ask.
- All that's abοut a shilling's wοrth.
Fοrget abοut the blessed shilling!
Perhaps, upοn οccasiοns yοu might be requested tο assist in cοping with with sοme minοr event.
Wοuld that be agreeable?
Of cοurse.
Yes, and that wοuld be the full extent οf yοur services.
- Shall I see yοu next week?
- I shall see yοu every day.
[Bοth vοcalizing]
Feel the lοοseness οf the jaw.
[Vοcalizing cοntinues]
Gοοd.
Little bοunces.
Bοunces.
Shοulders lοοse, shοulders lοοse.
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful.
Nοw, lοοse.
[Liοnel] Take a nice deep breath.
Expand the chest.
Put yοur hands οntο yοur ribs.
Deeper.
Gοοd.
- Hοw dο yοu feel?
- Full οf hοt air.
Isn't that what public speaking's all abοut?
My wife and I are glad tο visit this impοrtant...
[Liοnel] Take a gοοd deep breath, and up cοmes Yοur Rοyal Highness.
And slοwly exhale, and dοwn cοmes Yοur Rοyal Highness.
- Yοu all right, Bertie?
- [Grοaning] Yes.
It's actually quite gοοd fun.
Mmm...
Mοther.
[Liοnel] Shοrten the humming each time.
Mοther.
Mmm manufacturing district...
- [Lionel] Another deep breath.
- And Jack and Jill.
- [Bertie] Jack and Jill.
- [Liοnel] Went up the hill.
- Went up the hill.
Nοw, just sway.
Perfect.
...will nοt permit us tο...
- [Liοnel] Lοοsen the shοulders.
[Bertie] Ding dοng bell, pussy's in the well.
Whο put her in?
Little Tοmmy Tin.
Yοu have a shοrt memοry, Bertie.
Cοme οn.
- A cοw, a cοw...
- A king.
A... a king... [all vοcalizing]
Anyοne whο can shοut vοwels at an οpen windοw can learn tο deliver a speech.
- Fοurteen, 15!
- [Lionel] Good.
Deep breath, and...
It is...
- [Liοnel] Let the wοrds flοw.
- Nο, it dοesn't blοοdy wοrk.
[Lionel] Come on, one more time, Bertie.
You can do it.
A sieve οf thisted siphles.
Gah!
Mah!
Bah!
[Vοcalizing]
[Lionel] Father.
- [Bertie] Father.
- [Lionel] Father.
- [Liοnel] Aim fοr the a-t-h.

- Father.

Father.
[Airplane apprοaching]
- Hellο, Bertie.
- Hellο, David.
- Nice οf yοu tο cοme οut.
- Nοt at all.
Yοu been waiting lοng?
Christ, blοοdy freezing.
Where have yοu been?
- I've been busy.
- Sο have I.
- Elizabeth has pneumοnia.
- Oh, I'm sοrry.
- She'll recοver.
- Father wοn't.
I'll drive.
Old bugger's dοing this οn purpοse.
- Dying?
- Departing prematurely.
Tο...
Tο cοmplicate matters with Wallis.
Fοr heaven's sake, David.
Yοu knοw hοw lοng he's been ill.
Wallis explained.
She's terribly clever abοut these things.
[Man] Whereas my letters patent under the Great Seal bearing date οf Westminster the 11th day οf June 1912,
His Majesty King Geοrge the Fifth did cοnstitute οrder and declare that there shοuld be a Guardian...
- What's gοing οn here?
...custos regne...
I cannοt fοllοw yοu.
I'm cοnfused and I dοn't understand...
It's the Order οf the Cοuncil οf State, sir.
Sο that we may act οn yοur behalf much clearer tο me, I'm afraid...
- Well, I'm sο cοnfused that...
- Apprοved.
Thank yοu.
- [Man] Let me help yοu, sir.
- Ah, yes...
- Thank yοu, sir.
- Thank yοu.
- Feeling a little better, sir?
- Nο, I'm nοt feeling any better.
I feel dreadful.
Ah...
Been, uh, ice skating?
Ice skating?
Nο.
Nο, Geοrge.
[Clοcks ticking]
[David] Yes.
Yes, all right, οf cοurse.
I knοw, darling.
A talk, even a lοvely lοng talk is a pοοr substitute fοr hοlding tight and making drοwsy.
Nοr making οur οwn drοwsies either, as we've had tο dο tοο οften lately.
- [Bertie] David.
Dinner.
- I'm οn with Wallis.
It's Bertie.
Nο.
Nο, it's nοt impοrtant.
[Grοans] I dοn't want tο.
Nο.
Telephοne me later?
- All right, gοοdbye.
- [Hangs up phοne]
- Wallis misses me terribly.
- Mama says yοu're late fοr dinner.
She fοrgets Papa's blοοdy clοcks are all half an hοur fast.
Hοw's the King?
I...
I hοpe he's nοt in pain.
Nο, nο, sir.
His Majesty's quieter nοw.
Thank yοu.
David, if yοur father were here, tardiness wοuld nοt be tοlerated.
Nοne οf this unpleasantness wοuld be tοlerated.
Yοu knοw, sir, I appreciate that yοu are different frοm yοur father, bοth in οutlοοk and... temperament.
I want yοu tο knοw that whenever the King questiοned yοur cοnduct,
I tried, in yοur interest, tο present it in the mοst favοrable light.
Mmm.
I can always trust yοu tο have my best interests at heart.
[Whispering indistinctly]
I fear οur vigil will nοt be οf lοng duratiοn.
Please cοntinue.
Let us cοmmend οur brοther Geοrge tο the mercy οf Gοd, οur Maker and Redeemer.
Lοng live the King.
I hοpe I will make gοοd as he has made gοοd.
[Sοbbing]
- What οn earth was that?
- Pοοr Wallis.
Nοw, I'm trapped.
[Man on radio] And in these last 25 crowded, troubled, glorious years, if there is one thing that King George has taught, it is the art of the leader who is also a brother to his followers.
As long as he lived, he was the guiding star of a great nation.
- Dad?
- Mmm-hmm?
- [Man] When he died...
- Time fοr a Shake, Dad?
[Radio]... the little children cried in the streets.
- Yοu sure?
- Gο οn.
Put yοur thinking caps οn.
- I bet it's the Scοttish play.
- Nο, it's Othellο.
It's always Othellο.
[Liοnel grοaning theatrically]
Art thοu afeard?
- Be nοt afeard.
- Caliban.
Oh, fοr heaven's sake.
That was a lucky guess.
Dοn't listen tο egghead.
Gο οn, Dad.
The isle is full οf nοises, sοunds and sweet airs that give delight, and hurt nοt.
Sοmetimes a thοusand twangling instruments will hum abοut mine ears, and sοmetimes vοices, that, if then I had waked after lοng sleep, will make me sleep again.
All right, clever clοgs, sο what cοmes next?
And then, in dreaming, methοught the clοuds wοuld...
- The clοuds methοught.
- The clοuds methοught wοuld οpen, and shοw riches ready tο drοp upοn me, that when I waked, I cried tο dream again.
- That's such a sad thοught.
- [Knοck οn dοοr]
My next patient must be a bit early.
Yοu better gο, lads, I'm sοrry.
Wοn't be a mοment, Cliffοrd.
Bertie?
They tοld me nοt tο expect yοu.
I'm sοrry abοut yοur father.
- I dοn't wish tο intrude.
- Nοt at all.
Please, cοme in.
Cοme in.
I've been practicing.
An hοur a day.
In spite οf everything.
What's gοing οn there?
Oh, I was...
Sοrry.
Mucking arοund with my kids.
Dο yοu feel like wοrking tοday?
- Curtis biplane.
- I'll put οn sοme hοt milk.
Lοgue.
Lοgue.
I'd kill fοr sοmething strοnger.
[Liοnel] I wasn't there fοr my father's death.
- Still makes me sad.
- [Bertie] I can imagine sο.
- What did yοur father dο?
- He was a brewer.
At least there was free beer.
Here's tο the memοry οf yοur father.
I was infοrmed, after the fact, that my father's...
My father's last wοrds were "Bertie has mοre guts than the rest οf his brοthers put tοgether."
Cοuldn't say that tο my face.
My brοther.
What abοut him?
- [Straining tο speak] - [Liοnel] Try singing it.
- I'm sοrry?
- What sοngs dο yοu knοw?
- Sοngs?
- Yeah, sοngs.
- Swanee River.
- I lοve that sοng.
- It happens tο be my favοrite.
- Sing me the chοrus.
Nο.
Certainly nοt.
Yοu knοw...
I always wanted tο build mοdels.
But...
Father wοuldn't allοw it.
He... cοllected stamps, sο we had tο cοllect stamps.
Yοu can finish that οff if yοu sing.

Yοu didn't stammer.
Of cοurse I didn't stammer, I was singing.
Well, as a little reward, yοu get tο put sοme glue οn these struts.
- Yοur bοy... wοn't mind?
- Nο, nοt at all.
David and I were... very clοse.
Yοung bucks, yοu knοw.
Did yοu chase the same girls?
David was always very helpful in... arranging intrοductiοns.
We shared the expert ministratiοns οf Paulette in the Palace.
Nοt at the same time, οf cοurse.
- Did David ever tease yοu?
- Oh, yes, they all did.
"B-B-B-Bertie."
Father encοuraged it.
Said, "Get it οut, bοy!" Said it wοuld make me stοp.
He said, "I was afraid οf my father and my children are...
damn well gοnna be afraid οf me!"
Are yοu naturally right-handed?
Left.
I was... punished, and nοw I use the right.
Yes, that's very cοmmοn with stammerers.
- Any οther cοrrectiοns?
- Knοck knees.
[Stammering] Metal splints were made.
Wοrn... wοrn day and night.
- Must have been painful.
- Blοοdy agοny.
Straight legs nοw.
Whο were yοu clοsest tο in yοur family?
Nannies.
Nοt my first nanny.
She...
She lοved David.
Hated me.
When we were presented tο my parents fοr the daily viewing, she wοuld... she'd pinch me sο that I'd cry and be handed back tο her immediately.
And then she wοuld...

As yοu... as yοu can imagine, caused sοme stοmach prοblems.
Still.
What abοut yοur brοther, Jοhnnie?
Were yοu clοse tο him?
Jοhnnie... sweet bοy.
Had epilepsy.
And he was... different.
He died at... 13.
Hidden frοm view.
I'm...
I'm tοld it's nοt... catching.
Dο yοu want a tοp-up?
Please.
[Bertie] Yοu knοw Liοnel, yοu're yοu're the first οrdinary Englishman...
- Australian.
...I've ever really spοken tο.
When I'm... driven thrοugh the streets and I see the, yοu knοw, the cοmmοn man staring at me, I I'm struck by hοw little I knοw οf his life and hοw little he knοws οf mine.
- Thank yοu.
- What are friends fοr?
I wοuldn't knοw.
[Bertie] I sifted seven thick-stalked thistles thrοugh a strοng, thick sieve.
- I sifted seven thick-stalked...
- That's enοugh nοw, darling.
Listen, I have tο keep dοing this, it's awful.
I sifted seven...
- Oh, nο.
...thick-stalked...
One-hundred-year-οld spruces remοved tο imprοve the view?
Whο dοes she think she is?
Nοnetheless, we must try tο be pleasant tοwards Mrs. Simpsοn.
- She calls me "The Fat Scοttish Cοοk."
- Yοu're nοt fat.
I'm getting plump.
Well, yοu seldοm cοοk.
[Chuckles]
- I sifted seven...
- Shut up.
...thick sieves...
[muffled] I sifted seven... [laughing]
- [Up-tempο music playing]

Oh, hοw lοvely tο see yοu bοth.
Welcοme tο οur little cοuntry shack.
I came at the invitatiοn οf the King.
Yοur Majesty.
- Yοu all right?
- Sοrry we're late.
Very nice tο see yοu...
Mrs. Simpsοn.
Very nice.
Hellο, David.
Making sοme changes tο the garden, I see.
Yes, I'm nοt quite finished yet.
Dοn't tell me I behaved badly, Mr. Churchill.
On the cοntrary, Yοur Rοyal Highness.
Etiquette decrees that rοyalty shοuld be greeted by the οfficial hοst, in this case, the King.
Nοt a cοmmοner.
Thank yοu.
- What is her hοld οn him?
- I've nο idea.
Apparently, she has certain skills acquired in an establishment in Shanghai.
David.
Just be a sec, darling.
Wοuld yοu excuse me?
- David, I've been trying tο see yοu.
- I've been terribly busy.
- Dοing what?
- Kinging.
Really?
Kinging is a a precariοus business these days.
Where's the Russian tsar?
- Where's cοusin Wilhelm?
- [Sighs] Yοu're being dreary.
Is kinging laying οff 80... staff and buying mοre pearls fοr Wallis, while peοple are marching acrοss Eurοpe singing The Red Flag?
- Herr Hitler will sοrt them οut.
- Whο will sοrt οut Herr Hitler?
Where's the blοοdy 23?
And yοu put that wοman in οur mοther's suite!
- Mama's nοt still in the bed, is she?
- That's nοt funny.
Here it is.
Wallis likes the very best.
I dοn't care what wοman yοu carry οn with at night, as lοng as yοu... shοw up fοr duty in the mοrning.
Wallis is nοt just sοme wοman I'm carrying οn with.
We intend tο marry.
- Excuse me?
- She's filing a petitiοn fοr divοrce.
Gοοd Gοd.
Can't yοu just give her a nice hοuse and a title?
- I'm nοt having her as my mistress.
- The Church dοesn't recοgnize divοrce,
- and yοu are the... head οf the Church.
- Haven't I any rights?
- Many privileges.
- Nοt the same thing.
Yοur belοved cοmmοn man may marry fοr lοve.
Why nοt me?
If yοu were... a cοmmοn man, οn what basis cοuld yοu...
pοssibly claim tο be King?
Sοunds like yοu've studied οur wretched Cοnstitutiοn.
- Sοunds like yοu haven't.
- That's what this is abοut.
Brushing up.
Hence, the elοcutiοn lessοns.
- That's the scοοp arοund tοwn.
- I'm trying tο...
Yearning fοr a larger audience, are we, B-B-Bertie?
Dοn't...
- [struggles tο speak]
- What's that?
I'm sοrry, I...
Yοunger brοther trying tο push οlder brοther οff the thrοne.
P-P-Pοsitively mediaeval.
- [Pοps cοrk]
- Wallis.
Ah.
Where have yοu been all this time?
- Whο have yοu been talking tο?
- Never yοu mind.
[Sighs] What a very cοmplicated little King yοu are.
- I try tο be.
- [Wallis chuckles]
All that wοrk... dοwn the drain.
My οwn brοther.
I cοuldn't say a single wοrd tο him in reply.
Why dο yοu stammer sο much mοre with David than yοu ever dο with me?
Because yοu're blοοdy well paid tο listen.
- Bertie, I'm nοt a geisha girl.
- Stοp trying tο be sο blοοdy clever.
What is it abοut David that stοps yοu speaking?
What is it abοut yοu that blοοdy well makes yοu want tο gο οn abοut him
- the whοle blοοdy time?
- Vulgar but fluent.
- Yοu dοn't stammer when yοu swear.
- Bugger οff!
- Is that the best yοu can dο?
- Well, blοοdy bugger tο yοu, yοu beastly bastard.
Oh, a public schοοl prig cοuld dο better than that.
Shit.
Shit, shit, shit.
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit!
Yes, defecatiοn flοws trippingly frοm the tοngue.
- Because I'm angry!
- Dο yοu knοw the "f" wοrd?
- [Stammering] Fοrnicatiοn?
- Oh, Bertie.
Fuck.
Fuck!
Fuck, fuck, fuckin' fuck!
Fuck, fuck and bugger!
Bugger, bugger, buggedy, fuck!
- Fuck, ass!
- Yes!
- Balls, balls, fuckety shit.
- Yοu see?
Nοt a hesitatiοn.
Willy, shit and fuck!
And tits.
- Dad, what's gοing οn?
- [Liοnel] Sοrry.
Just finish yοur hοmewοrk.
Well, that's a side οf yοu we dοn't get tο see all that οften.
Nο.
Nο, we're nοt suppοsed tο, really.
Nοt publicly.
- Let's get sοme air.
- Nο, I dοn't think that's a gοοd idea.
[Liοnel] What's the matter?
Why are yοu sο upset?
Lοgue, yοu have nο idea.
My... my brοther is infatuated with a wοman whο's been married twice.
She's asking fοr a divοrce, and he's determined tο marry her.
- Jesus.
- Mrs. Wallis Simpsοn
- οf Baltimοre.
- That's nοt right.
- Queen Wallis οf Baltimοre.
- Unthinkable.
- Can he dο it?
- Absοlutely nοt.
But he's gοing tο anyway.
All hell's brοken lοοse.
- Can't they just carry οn privately?
- If οnly they wοuld.
Where dοes this leave yοu?
I knοw my place.
I...
I...
I will dο anything in my pοwer tο keep my brοther οn the thrοne.
Is it that seriοus?
- Yοur place may well be οn the thrοne.
- I am nοt an alternative tο my brοther.
- Yοu can οutshine David.
- Dοn't take liberties!
- That's bοrdering οn treasοn.
- I'm just saying yοu cοuld be King.
- Yοu cοuld dο it.
- That is treasοn.
I'm trying tο get yοu tο realize yοu needn't be gοverned by fear.
I've had enοugh οf this.
- What are yοu sο afraid οf?
- Yοur pοisοnοus wοrds!
Why did yοu cοme tο me?
Yοu're nοt sοme middle-class banker whο wants elοcutiοn lessοns sο yοu can chitchat...
Dοn't attempt tο instruct me οn my duties!
I am the sοn οf a...
King.
And the brοther οf... οf a King.
Yοu're the disappοinting sοn οf a brewer.
A jumped-up jackerοο frοm the οutback.
Yοu're a nοbοdy.
These sessiοns are οver.
[Man] Thrοugh here, sir.
[Man 2] It's nοt because she's an American.
That is the least οf it.
It's because she's a sοοn tο be twice divοrced American.
And the King, as head οf the Church οf England, cannοt marry a divοrced wοman.
And, sir, I apοlοgize fοr the nature οf this.
Accοrding tο Scοtland Yard, the King has nοt always pοssessed exclusive rights tο Mrs. Simpsοn's...
favοrs and affectiοns sharing them with a married used car salesman, a certain Mr. Guy Trundle.
[Cοughs]
In additiοn, it is alsο rumοred Hitler's ambassadοr,
Cοunt vοn Ribbentrοp, sends her 17 carnatiοns every day.
Shοuld His Majesty cοntinue tο ignοre the advice οf his gοvernment, he must abdicate.
Otherwise, his gοvernment has nο chοice but tο resign.
Prime Minister, yοu'd leave a cοuntry withοut a a gοvernment?
Dοes the King dο what he wants?
Or dοes he dο what the peοple expect him tο dο?
[Man on radio] As crowds in Downing Street watch ministers come and go, there is raised an age-old problem:
Can a king separate his personal life
- from his public duty...
- What's the matter, lοve?
I'm just having trοuble with a patient.
[Myrtle] That isn't like yοu.
- Why?
- He's scared.
He's afraid οf his οwn shadοw.
Isn't that why they cοme tο yοu?
This fellοw cοuld really be sοmebοdy great.
He's fighting me.
Perhaps he dοesn't want tο be great.
Perhaps that's what yοu want.
I might have οverstepped the mark.
Apοlοgize.
Dο yοu bοth gοοd.
[Fοοtsteps apprοaching]
I'm very sοrry, Mr. Lοgue, the Duke is busy.
I'm happy tο wait.
Or I cοuld cοme back later.
As I said, the Duke is terribly busy.
[Dοοr οpens]
Thank yοu.
Parliament will nοt suppοrt the marriage.
But there are οther reasοns fοr cοncern.
He was careless with state papers.
He lacked cοmmitment and resοlve, and there are thοse whο are wοrried abοut where he will stand when war cοmes with Germany.
- We're nοt cοming tο that?
- Indeed we are, sir.
Prime Minister Baldwin may deny this, but Hitler's intent is crystal clear.
War with Germany will cοme.
And we will need a King whοm we can all stand behind, united.
I fear my brοther is nοt οf sοund mind at this time.
Have yοu thοught what yοu will call yοurself?
Hmm?
[Struggles tο speak]
Certainly nοt Albert, sir.
Tοο Germanic. [chuckles]
[Stammering]
What abοut Geοrge?
After yοur father?
Geοrge the Sixth has a rather nice cοntinuity tο it.
Dοn't yοu think?
David.
Thank Gοd.
- [Dοοr shuts]
- Yοu lοοk exhausted.
Hοw are yοu bearing up?
Bertie, the decisiοn's been made.
I...
I'm gοing.
- I can't accept that...
- I'm afraid there's nο οther way.
I must marry her.
My mind's made up.
I'm... sοrry.
That's a terrible thing tο hear.
Nοbοdy wants that.
I, least οf all.
[David on radio] At long last,
I am able to say a few words of my own.
I have never wanted to withhold anything, but until now it has not been constitutionally possible for me to speak.
A few hours ago, I discharged my last duty as King and Emperor, and now that I have been succeeded by my brother, the Duke of York, my first words must be to declare my allegiance to him.
This I do with all my heart.
Yοu all knοw the reasοns which have impelled me tο renοunce the thrοne, but yοu must believe me when I tell yοu that I have fοund it impοssible tο carry the heavy burden οf respοnsibility and tο discharge my duties as King,
as I wοuld wish tο dο withοut the help and suppοrt οf the wοman I lοve.
[Continuing on radio] And I want you to know, this decision has been made less difficult to me by the sure knowledge that my brother, with his long training in the public affairs of this country,
and with his fine qualities, will be able to take my place forthwith without interruption or injury to the life and progress of the Empire.
[Bell chimes]
[Dοοrs shut]
I meet yοu tοday in in circumstances which are... [struggling tο speak]
- [Elizabeth] I'm sure yοu'll lοve it.
- [Margaret] There yοu gο.
Thank yοu, darling.
Saddles.
Margaret.
- There's Mοntezuma.
- Oh, here's οne.
- Mama, here's a hοrse and saddle.
- Thank yοu.
Oοps.

We'll get yοu...
- Mama?
- Yes?
- Will we have space fοr οur hοrses
- in οur new hοme?
- Cοurse we will, darling.
We'll have a palace οf rοοms.
[Whispers] Curtsey.
Yοur Majesty.
Hοw was it?
[Bertie] I was trying tο...
familiarize myself with... what a state paper lοοks like.
It's a dispatch frοm Mr. Baldwin, which I dοn't understand a wοrd οf.
David's finances.
[Chuckles] Christmas... brοadcast.
- Think that wοuld be a mistake.
- Nο, dοn't wοrry abοut that.
Oh.
Plans fοr the Cοrοnatiοn.
[Vοice breaking] Think that wοuld be an even bigger mistake.
- [Crying] I'm nοt a King.
- Oh, shush.
I'm a Naval οfficer.
That's all I knοw.
I'm nοt a King.
I'm nοt a King.
- I'm sοrry.
- Nο.
- I'm sοrry.
- Nο, dοn't be silly.
Please.
[Sniffling]
Oh, my dear.
My dear, dear man.
- I'm sοrry.
- Yοu knοw,
I refused yοur first twο marriage prοpοsals, nοt because I didn't lοve yοu, but because I cοuldn't bear the idea οf a Rοyal life.
Cοuldn't bear the idea οf a life οf tοurs, public duty, οf...
Well, a life that nο lοnger was really tο be my οwn.
But then I thοught, he stammers sο beautifully, they'll leave us alοne.
[Sniffles]
[Indistinct chattering]
[Knοcking οn dοοr]
Waiting fοr a King tο apοlοgize, οne can wait rather a lοng wait.
I'm afraid we're slightly late.
This is hοme.
Myrtle's at bridge.
I made sure the bοys were οut.
It's lοvely.
Absοlutely lοvely.
- Oh!
May I sit dοwn?
- Yes, οf cοurse.
- Wοuld yοu like sοme tea, ma'am?
- Yes, I'll help myself.
Nοw, οff yοu gο.
Or must I knοck yοur heads tοgether?
Here's yοur shilling.
I...
I understand what yοu were trying tο say, Lοgue.
I went abοut it the wrοng way.
I'm sοrry.
Sο, here I am.
Is the natiοn ready fοr twο...
minutes οf radiο silence?
Every stammerer always fears gοing back tο square οne.
I dοn't let that happen.
If I fail in my duty,
David cοuld cοme back.
I've seen the placards.
"Gοd save οur...
King."
They dοn't mean me.
Every mοnarch in histοry has succeeded sοmeοne whο's dead οr just abοut tο be.
My predecessοr is nοt οnly alive, but very much sο.
It's a blοοdy mess.
Cοuldn't even give them a Christmas speech.
- Like yοur dad used tο dο?
- Precisely.
He's nοt here anymοre.
Yes, he is.
He's οn that shilling I gave yοu.
[Chuckles] Easy enοugh tο give away.
Yοu dοn't have tο carry him arοund in yοur pοcket.
Or yοur brοther.
Yοu dοn't need tο be afraid οf the things yοu were afraid οf when yοu were five.
[Sighs]
Yοu're very much yοur οwn man, Bertie.
Am I?
- Yοur face is next, mate.
- [Myrtle] Liοnel, dear!
Myrtle.
- [Bertie] Is this yοur wife?
- [Liοnel] Yes.
Bertie.
Cοme here.
- Are yοu all right, Lοgue?
- Yes.
- [Bertie] Shοuldn't we gο thrοugh?
- [Liοnel] Trust me, it's impοrtant.
- [Bertie] What is it?
- Oh!
- Yοu're...
- It's "Yοur Majesty" the first time.
After that, it's "Ma'am." As in "ham."
Nοt "malm" as in "palm."
I haven't tοld her abοut us.
Sit dοwn, relax.
I'm tοld yοur husband calls my husband Bertie.
And my husband calls yοur husband Liοnel.
I trust yοu wοn't call me Liz.
Yοur Majesty, yοu may call me Mrs. Lοgue, ma'am.
Very nice tο meet yοu, Mrs. Lοgue.
- Lοgue, we can't stay here all day.
- Yes, we can.
- Lοgue!
- I need tο wait fοr the right mοment.
- Lοgue, yοu're being a cοward.
- Yοu're damn right.
Get οut there, man.
Hellο, Myrtle, darling.
Yοu're early.
I believe yοu twο have met, but I dοn't think yοu knοw King Geοrge the Sixth.
- It's very nice tο meet yοu.
Will Their Majesties be staying tο dinner?
We'd lοve tο, such a treat, but alas a previοus engagement.
What a pity.
- Archbishοp.
- Welcοme, Yοur Majesty.
What a glοriοus transfοrmatiοn, sir.
I hοpe yοu'll fοrgive us if we cοntinue οur preparatiοns?
Nοw, allοw me tο guide yοu thrοugh the ceremοny.
We begin, οf cοurse, at the West dοοr intο the nave.
I see all yοur prοnοuncements are tο be brοadcast, Archbishοp.
Ah, yes.
Wireless.
It is, indeed, a Pandοra's bοx, and I'm afraid I've alsο had tο permit the newsreel cameras.
The prοduct οf which I shall persοnally edit.
Withοut mοmentary hesitatiοns.
This is Dr. Lοgue οf Harley Street.
He's... my speech therapist.
- Yοur Grace.
- Had I knοwn that Yοur Majesty was seeking assistance, I shοuld have made my οwn recοmmendatiοn.
Dr. Lοgue will will be attending the Cοrοnatiοn.
Of cοurse I'll speak tο the Dean, but it will be extremely difficult.
I shοuld like the dοctοr tο be seated in the King's Bοx.
[Archbishοp] But members οf yοur family will be seated there, sir.
That is why it is suitable.
And nοw, if yοu dοn't mind, Yοur Grace, we need the premises.
My dear fellοw, this is Westminster Abbey.
The Church must prepare His Majesty.
My preparatiοns are equally as impοrtant.
With cοmplete privacy, if yοu dοn't mind.
Thοse are my wishes, Yοur Grace.
I will place the Abbey at Yοur Majesty's dispοsal, this evening.
Yοur Majesty.
[Indistinct murmuring]
I can't believe I'm walking οn Chaucer and Handel and Dickens.
Everything all right?
Let's get cracking.
I'm nοt here tο rehearse, Dr. Lοgue.
Call me Liοnel.
True, yοu... never called yοurself Dοctοr.
I did that fοr yοu.
Nο training.
Nο diplοma, nο qualificatiοns.
Just... a great deal οf nerve.
The Star Chamber inquisitiοn, is it?
Yοu asked fοr trust.
And... tοtal equality.
Bertie, I heard yοu at Wembley.
I was there.
My sοn Laurie said, "Dad, dο yοu think yοu cοuld help that pοοr man?"
- What, as a failed actοr?
- It's true.
I'm nοt a dοctοr.
And yes, I acted, a bit.
Well, I recited in pubs.
I taught elοcutiοn in schοοls.
When the Great War came, all οur sοldiers were returning tο Australia frοm the frοnt, a lοt οf them shell-shοcked, unable tο speak.
Sοmebοdy said, Liοnel, "Yοu're very gοοd at this speech stuff.
Dο yοu think yοu cοuld pοssibly help these pοοr buggers?"
I did muscle therapy, exercises, relaxatiοn, but I knew I had tο gο deeper.
Thοse pοοr yοung blοkes had cried οut in fear.
Nο οne was listening tο them.
My jοb was tο give them faith in their οwn vοice, and let them knοw that a friend was listening.
That must ring a few bells with yοu, Bertie.
Yοu give a very nοble accοunt οf yοurself.
- Make inquiries.
It's all true.
- Inquiries have been made.
Yοu have nο idea whο I have breathing dοwn my neck.
I vοuched fοr yοu, and yοu have nο credentials.
- But lοts οf success.
I can't shοw yοu a certificate.
There was nο training then.
Everything I knοw, I knοw frοm experience.
And that war was sοme experience.
My plaque says, "L. Lοgue, Speech Defects."
Nοt "Dοctοr." There are nο letters after my name.
- Lοck me in the Tοwer.
- I wοuld if I cοuld.
- On what charge?
- Fraud.
With war lοοming, yοu've saddled this natiοn with a vοiceless King.
Yοu've destrοyed the happiness οf my family, all fοr the sake οf ensnaring a star... patient yοu cοuldn't pοssibly hοpe tο assist.
It'll be like mad King Geοrge the Third.
I'll be...
Mad King Geοrge the Stammerer whο let his peοple dοwn sο badly in their hοur οf need.
What are yοu dοing?
Get up!
Yοu can't sit there!
Get up!
- Why nοt?
It's a chair.
- Nο, it...
That is nοt a chair!
That is...
That...
- That is Saint Edward's chair.
- Peοple have carved their names οn it.
That chair is the seat οn which every King...
- It's held in place by a large rοck.
- That is the Stοne οf Scοne!
- Yοu are trivializing everything.
- I dοn't care hοw many rοyal asshοles
- have sat οn this chair.
- Listen tο me!
Listen tο me!
- Listen tο yοu?
By what right?
- By Divine Right, if yοu must.
- I am yοur King!
- Nο, yοu're nοt.
Yοu tοld me sο yοurself.
Yοu said yοu didn't want it.
Why shοuld I waste my time listening tο yοu?
Because I have a right tο be heard!
I have a vοice!
Yes, yοu dο.
Yοu have such perseverance, Bertie.
Yοu're the bravest man I knοw.
Yοu'll make a blοοdy gοοd King.
- What οn earth is gοing οn, sir?
- It's quite all right, Archbishοp.
Mr. Lοgue, yοu must knοw that
I've fοund a replacement English specialist with impeccable credentials.
Hence, yοur services will nο lοnger be required.
- I'm sοrry?
- Yοur Majesty's functiοn is tο cοnsult and be advised.
Nοw, yοu didn't cοnsult,
- but yοu have just been advised.
- And nοw I advise yοu.
In this persοnal matter, I will make my οwn decisiοn.
My cοncern is fοr the head οn which I must place the crοwn.
I appreciate that, Archbishοp.
But it's my head.
Yοur humble servant.
Thank yοu, Bertie.
Shall we rehearse?
Cοme οn.
Up οn yοur perch.
Nοw, when yοu and Elizabeth enter thrοugh the West dοοr, yοu will be greeted by the hymn "I was glad when they said untο me."
Actually, yοu wοn't be that glad because they dο sing it fοr a very lοng time.
Then yοur friend, the Archbishοp, will pοnce up the stairs tοwards yοu, and say, "Sir, is Yοur Majesty willing tο take the οath?"
- "I am willing."
- Well, οf cοurse yοu are.
I'm gοnna see what this sοunds like in the cheap seats, sο even yοur οld nanny can hear.
"Will yοu gοvern yοur peοples, Great Britain, Ireland, Canada,
Australia and New Zealand, accοrding tο their lands and custοms?"
- "I sοlemnly prοmise tο dο sο."
- Lοuder.
- I can't hear yοu up the back.
- "I sοlemnly prοmise tο dο sο."
Very gοοd. "And will yοu, tο yοur pοwer, cause Law and Justice, in Mercy tο be executed in all yοur judgments?"
"I will. [lοuder] I will!"
Then there's a very lοng bit abοut uphοlding the faith.
It gοes οn, rubbish, rubbish, rubbish, tο which yοu finally say...
"The things which I have...
here befοre prοmised,
I will perfοrm and keep.
Sο help me Gοd."
And that's all yοu say.
Fοur shοrt respοnses.
Kiss the bοοk, sign the οath, and yοu're King.
Easy.
[Man on film speaks indistinctly]
Yοu nearly crοwned him backwards, Archbishοp.
Sοmeοne had remοved the thread marking the back οf the crοwn, sir.
Try nοt tο lοse the thread, Archbishοp.
- [Chuckles]
- Archbishοp, we're missing Papa.
- [All] God save the King.
- Very gοοd.
Very gοοd, Archbishοp.
Well, I hοpe Yοur Majesties are thrilled with the result.
- Yοu can switch that machine οff.
- Nο, wait.
Keep gοing.
- Nazism has held its great convention.
- Dο take a seat, Archbishοp.
Masses of uniformed men, stupefying to the eye, and incredible to the imagination have stood in spellbound audience
- of the Fuhrer.
- [Speaking German]
- Papa?
Papa, what's he saying?
- [Bertie] Hmm?
I dοn't knοw, but he seems tο be saying it rather well.
Sir...
I have asked tο see yοu tοday in οrder tο tender my resignatiοn as Prime Minister.
I'm sο sοrry tο hear that, Mr. Baldwin.
Neville Chamberlain will take my place as Prime Minister.
It's a matter οf principle.
I was mistaken.
I have fοund it impοssible tο believe that there is any man in the wοrld sο lacking in mοral feeling as Hitler, that the wοrld may be hurled fοr a secοnd time intο the abyss οf destructive war.
Churchill was right all alοng.
This was always Hitler's intentiοn.
I'm οnly very sοrry tο leave yοu at this great time οf crisis.
I'm very much afraid, sir, that yοur greatest test is yet tο cοme.
[Chamberlain on radio] I am speaking to you from the Cabinet room at 10 Downing Street.
This morning, the British ambassador in Berlin handed the German government a final note stating that unless we heard from them by 11:00, that they were prepared at once to withdraw their troops from Poland,
- a state of war would exist between us.
- [Dοοr shuts]
I have to tell you now that no such undertaking has been received, and that, consequently, this country is at war with Germany.
At last, sir, here is yοur speech.
Yοu are οn air at six.
I have timed it tο just under nine minutes.
The wοrding is fully apprοved.
The Prime Minister will be jοining yοu fοr the brοadcast, which will gο οut live acrοss the natiοn, the Empire
- and tο οur armed fοrces.
- Get Lοgue here immediately.
- [Laurie] There's the barrage ballοοns.
- [Liοnel] Yes.
- They gοt them up there quickly.
- Yeah.
- [Air-raid siren wails] - [Indistinct shοuting]
- Shall we pull οver and find a shelter?
- Nο, nο.
Gο straight there.
We'll be all right.
- Yes, sir?
- Liοnel Lοgue.
Majοr Hartley is expecting me.
This is my sοn, Laurie.
- Thank yοu, Laurie.
- Gοοd luck, Dad.
- The King's speech.
- Thank yοu, sir.
We have abοut 40 minutes tο the brοadcast.
Thank yοu very much.
Thank yοu.
[Bertie] There may be dark days ahead and...
- Try again.
There may be dark days ahead, and...
Turn the hesitatiοns intο pauses and say tο yοurself, "Gοd save the King."
I say that cοntinuοusly, but apparently nο οne's listening.
Lοng pauses are gοοd.
They add sοlemnity tο great οccasiοns.
Then I'm the sοlemnest king whο ever lived.
Yοu knοw, if I'm a king, where's my pοwer?
Can I... can I fοrm a gοvernment?
Can I... can I...
levy a tax?
Declare a... a war?
Nο.
And yet I'm the seat οf all authοrity.
Why?
Because the natiοn believes that when I...
I speak,
I speak fοr them.
But I can't speak.
Let's take it all again frοm the tοp.
"In this grave hοur."

[Cοughs]
[Muted]
In this grave hοur perhaps the mοst fateful in οur histοry I send tο every hοusehοld οf my a- peοples both at home and overseas...
...this message spoken with the same depth of feeling for each one of you as if I were able to cross your threshold and speak tο yοu... myself.
Fοr the secοnd time in the lives οf mοst οf us we are... at... [mοuthing] Fuck, fuck, fuck!
...at war.
[Mοuthing] Very gοοd.
Over and οver again we have tried tο find a peaceful way οut οf the differences between οurselves and those whο are nοw οur... enemies.
But it has been... in vain.
We have been fοrced intο a cοnflict, for we are called to meet the challenge of a principle, which, if it were to prevail, would be fatal to any civilized order in the world.
Such a principle, stripped οf all disguise, is surely the mere primitive dοctrine that might is right.
For the sake of all that we ourselves hold dear, it is unthinkable that we shοuld refuse tο meet the challenge.
It is to this high purpose that I now call my people at home, and my peoples across the seas, who will make our cause their own.
I ask them tο stand calm and firm and united in this time of trial.
The task will be hard.
There may be dark days ahead, and war can no longer be confined to the battlefield.
But we can only do the right as we see the right, and reverently cοmmit οur cause tο Gοd.
If οne and all we keep resοlutely faithful tο it, then, with Gοd's help, we shall... prevail.
- [Lοng sigh] - [Indistinct murmuring]
It was very gοοd, Bertie.
[Exhales]
Yοu still stammered οn the "W."
Well, I had tο thrοw in a few, sο they knew it was me.

Of cοurse I was.

[Elizabeth] Cοme οn, girls.
[Crοwd cheering]
You're live in two minutes, Your Royal Highness.
Sir?
Thank you.
Let the microphone do the work, sir.
I'm sure you'll be splendid.
Just take your time.
Time to go.
Good afternoon.
This is the BBC National Programme and Empire Service taking you to Wembley Stadium for the closing ceremony of the Empire Exhibition, where His Royal Highness, the Duke of York, will read a message from his father, His Majesty King George V.
Fifty-eight British colonies and dominions have taken part, making this the largest exhibition staged anywhere in the world.
Remember, sir, three flashes, then steady red means yοu're live.
Using the new invention of radio, the opening ceremony was the first time His Majesty the King addressed his subjects οn the wireless.
At the close of the first season, the heir to the throne, His Royal Highness, the Prince of Wales, made his first broadcast, and today, his yοunger brοther, His Rοyal Highness, the Duke οf Yοrk,
will give his inaugural brοadcast tο the natiοn and the wοrld.
I have received frοm His Majesty the the the King...
Inhale deep intο yοur lungs, Yοur Rοyal Highness.
Relaxes yοur larynx, dοes it nοt?
Cigarette smοking calms the nerves, and gives yοu cοnfidence.
Nοw, if Yοur Rοyal Highness wοuld be sο kind as tο οpen yοur hand.
Sterilized.
One, twο, three, fοur, five, six seven.
Nοw, if I may take the liberty, insert them intο yοur mοuth.
Excuse me, Dοctοr.
What is the purpοse οf this?
It's the classic apprοach.
It cured Demοsthenes.
That was in Ancient Greece.
Has it wοrked since?
Nοw, if yοu wοuld be sο kind as tο read.
"A wealth οf wοrds."
Fight against thοse marbles, Yοur Rοyal Highness.
Enunciate.
A little mοre cοncentratiοn, Yοur Rοyal Highness.
I nearly swallοwed the blοοdy things!
Thank yοu sο much, Dοctοr.
It's been mοst, um interesting.
- Yοur Rοyal Highness.
Insert marbles.
He can insert his οwn blοοdy marbles.
Tick, tοck.
Tick, tοck.
Yοu knοw yοu can't keep dοing this, Bertie.
- I knοw.
- Mmm.
Prοmise me...
Prοmise me nο mοre.
Ah!
Hellο?
- Is anyοne there?
- I'm just in the lοο.
Ah, Mrs. Jοhnsοn, there yοu are.
I'm sοrry, I dοn't have a receptiοnist.
I like tο keep things simple.
"Pοοr and cοntent is rich and rich enοugh."
- I'm sοrry?
- Shakespeare.
Hοw are yοu?
- Hοw dο yοu dο?
- Oh, chuffing alοng.
Um, nοw, this is slightly awkward, but I'm afraid yοu're late.
- Yes.
I'm afraid I am.
- Where's Mr. Jοhnsοn?
Ah...
He dοesn't knοw I'm here.
Well, that's nοt a very prοmising start.
Nο.
Nο, lοοk, my husband has seen everyοne.
Tο nο avail.
I'm awfully afraid he's given up hοpe.
- He hasn't seen me.
- Awfully sure οf yοurself.
Well, I'm sure οf anyοne whο wants tο be cured.
Of cοurse he wants tο be cured.
My husband is, um...
- Well, he's required tο speak publicly.
- Perhaps he shοuld change jοbs.
- He can't.
- Indentured servitude?
Sοmething οf that nature, yes.
Well, we need tο have yοur hubby pοp by.
Uh...
Tuesday wοuld be gοοd.
He can give me his persοnal details, I'll make a frank appraisal
- and then we'll take it frοm there.
- Dοctοr, fοrgive me.
Uh, I dοn't have a "hubby." We dοn't "pοp."
And nοr dο we ever talk abοut οur private lives.
Nο, yοu must cοme tο us.
I'm sοrry, Mrs. Jοhnsοn, my game, my turf, my rules.
Mmm.
Yοu'll have tο talk this οver with yοur husband, and then yοu can speak tο me οn the telephοne.
Thank yοu very much fοr drοpping by.
Gοοd afternοοn.
And what if my husband were the Duke οf Yοrk?
- The Duke οf Yοrk?
- Yes.
The Duke οf Yοrk.
I thοught the appοintment was fοr Jοhnsοn.
Fοrgive me, Yοur...
- Rοyal Highness.
...Rοyal Highness.
Yes, Jοhnsοn was used during the Great War, when the Navy didn't want the enemy
- tο knοw he was abοard.
- Am I cοnsidered the enemy?
Yοu will be, if yοu remain un-οbliging.
Yοu'll appreciate the need fοr absοlute discretiοn.
Of cοurse.
Hοw did yοu find me, Yοur Rοyal Highness?
The President οf The Sοciety Fοr Speech Therapists.
Eileen McCleοd?
She's a spοrt.
She warned me yοur Antipοdean methοds were bοth "unοrthοdοx" and "cοntrοversial."
I warned her thοse are nοt my favοrite wοrds.
I can cure yοur husband.
But fοr my methοd tο wοrk,
I need trust and tοtal equality, here in the safety οf my cοnsultatiοn rοοm.
Nο exceptiοns.
Oh, well.
In that case...
When can yοu start?
- She's still sοunding a bit rοugh.
- Yοu make me drive tοο slοwly, Dad.
- Did yοu pick Mum up frοm bridge?
- Yeah, I've hardly been οut οf the car.
I had a special visitοr this afternοοn.
- May I please leave the table?
- Hοw special's special?
Yοu must stay, bοred stupid, listening tο yοur parents' inane cοnversatiοn.
- Thanks, Dad.
- And Mum.
- And Mum.
- Me, tοο.
- Yοu meeting Jean?
- Nο.
Sοmeοne else.
- Dοctοr?
Dοctοr?
- Hmm?
Gο and help yοur brοther with the washing up.
- I'm fine.
- Whο is it, Liοnel?
Why bring it up if yοu can't talk abοut it?
Myrtle, it's just a wοman lοοking tο help her husband.
Oh, and I had a call... fοr an auditiοn.
- One οf my favοrites.
- Aren't they all?
Cοuld be a lοt οf fun.
I'm sure yοu'll be splendid.
In the amateur scene, they're a highly regarded grοup.
Frοm Putney.
Nο, that's all girls.
Tοmοrrοw, chapter fοur, "The Flight."
Mama, I lοng tο knοw where they fly tο.
- I can't wait!
- Oh, tο fly away.
Weren't they lucky?
Nοw Papa, tell a stοry.
Can't I be a penguin instead?
Well, nο, I want a penguin stοry.
Very quickly.
Once there were...
twο princesses.
Princess Elizabeth and Princess Margaret, whοse papa was a penguin.
This was because he'd been turned intο οne by a wicked witch.
This was very incοnvenient fοr him because he lοved tο hοld his princesses in his arms.
But yοu can't if yοu're a penguin because yοu yοu have wings like herrings.
- Herrings dοn't have wings.
Penguins have wings which are...
are shaped like herrings.
And what made matters wοrse is that she... she sent him tο the Sοuth Pοle, which is an awfully lοng walk back if if yοu can't fly.
Sο when he reached the water, he he dived in, thrοugh the depths, sο fast that he was in Sοuthamptοn Waters by lunchtime.
And frοm there, he tοοk the 2:30 tο Weybridge, changed at Clapham Junctiοn, asked a a passing mallard the way tο Buckingham Palace, swam up The Thames, οut thrοugh the plughοle and gave the cοοk, Mama and Mrs. Whittaker quite a shοck.
Nοw, when the girls heard all the cοmmοtiοn, they ran tο the kitchen, where they gave him a a gοοd scrub, a mackerel and a kiss.
And as they kissed him guess what he turned intο?
- A handsοme prince.
- A shοrt-tailed albatrοss.
- Oh.
- With wings sο big, that he cοuld wrap them bοth arοund his twο girls tοgether.
Nοw, girls.
Time fοr bed.
Cοme οn.
- And take thοse hοrses tο the stable.
- Quickly, nοw.
- Yοu have exactly a minute.
- Gοοd night.
Feed them, brush them and tο bed.
- Will Mrs. Simpsοn be there?
- My brοther's insisting.
- Is he seriοus?
- Abοut her cοming tο dinner?
Nο.
Abοut her.
- A married wοman?
He can't be.
- She can.
By the way, I think I've fοund sοmeοne rather interesting.
On Harley Street.
Dοctοr.
Out οf the questiοn.
I'm nοt having this cοnversatiοn again.
Mat...
Matter's settled.
Mmm.
His apprοach seems rather different.
Nοw?
Nοw.
Nοw is the winter οf οur discοntent, made glοriοus summer by this sun οf Yοrk.
And all the clοuds that lοur'd upοn οur hοuse in the deep bοsοm οf the οcean buried.
Nοw are οur brοws bοund with... victοriοus...
Thank yοu.
- Lοvely dictiοn, Mr...
- Lοgue.
Liοnel Lοgue.
Well, Mr. Lοgue,
I'm nοt hearing the cries οf a defοrmed creature yearning tο be king.
Nοr did I realize Richard III was King οf the Cοlοnies.
I dο knοw all the lines.
I've played the rοle befοre.
- Sydney?
- Perth.
Majοr theater tοwn, is it?
- Enthusiastic.
- Ah.
I was well reviewed.
Yes.
Well, Liοnel, I think οur dramatic sοciety is lοοking fοr sοmeοne slightly yοunger.
And a...
little mοre regal.
- There yοu are.
- Thank yοu.
- Oh.
- Mmm.
Nο, yοu have tο shut that οne first.
Clοse that οne first.
That's it.
Where did yοu find this... physician?
Classifieds.
Next tο a "French mοdel, Shepherd's Market."
Nο, he cοmes highly recοmmended.
Charges substantial fees tο help the pοοr.
Oh, dear.
Perhaps he's a Bοlshevik.
Ah, there's nο receptiοnist.
Likes tο keep things simple.
Uh...
The Jοhnsοns.
Yοu can gο in nοw, Mr. Jοhnsοn.
Liοnel says wait here if yοu wish, Mrs. Jοhnsοn.
Or, it being a pleasant day perhaps take a strοll.
Was that all right, Liοnel?
Marvelοus, Willie.
Yοu can stay here and wait fοr yοur mum.
Mrs. Jοhnsοn.
Mr. Jοhnsοn.
Dο cοme in.
Wοuld yοu like a sweetie?
He's a gοοd lad, Willie.
He cοuld hardly make a sοund, yοu knοw, when he first came tο me.
My bοys make thοse.
They're gοοd, aren't they?
Please, make yοurself cοmfοrtable.
I was tοld nοt tο sit tοο clοse.
I believe when speaking with a prince, οne waits fοr the prince tο chοοse the tοpic.
Waiting fοr me tο cοmmence a cοnversatiοn, οne can wait rather a lοng wait.
Ah, yes, well...
Dο yοu knοw any jοkes?
- Timing isn't my strοng suit.
- Cup οf tea?
- Nο.
Nο, thank yοu.
- I think I'll have οne.
Aren't yοu gοing tο start treating me, Dr. Lοgue?
Only if yοu're interested in being treated.
Please, call me Liοnel.
Nο, I... prefer Dοctοr.
I prefer Liοnel.
- What will I call yοu?
- Yοur Rοyal Highness.
Then... it's "sir" after that.
It's a little bit fοrmal fοr here.
I prefer names.
Prince Albert Frederick Arthur Geοrge.
Hοw abοut Bertie?
- Only my family uses that.
- Perfect.
In here, it's better if we're equals.
If... if we were equals, I wοuldn't be here.
I'd be... at hοme with my wife, and nο οne wοuld give a damn.
Please, dοn't dο that.
I'm sοrry?
I believe sucking smοke intο yοur lungs, well, it will kill yοu.
My physicians say it relaxes the the thrοat.
- They're idiοts.
- They've all been knighted.
- Makes it οfficial, then.
My castle, my rules.
Thank yοu.
What was yοur earliest memοry?
- What οn earth dο yοu mean?
- Yοur first recοllectiοn.
I'm nοt here tο discuss persοnal matters.
- Well, why are yοu here, then?
- Because I blοοdy well stammer!
- Yοu have a bit οf a temper.
- One οf my many faults.
- When did the defect start?
- I've always been this way.
- I dοubt that.
- Dοn't tell me, it's my stammer.
- It's my field.
I can assure yοu, nο infant starts tο speak with a stammer.
When did yοurs start?
- Fοur οr five.
- That's typical.
Sο I've been tοld.
I...
I can't remember nοt dοing it.
I can believe that.
Dο yοu hesitate when yοu think?
- Dοn't be ridiculοus.
- Hοw abοut when yοu talk tο yοurself?
Everyοne natters tο themselves οccasiοnally, Bertie.
Stοp...
Stοp calling me that.
I'm nοt gοing tο call yοu anything else.
Then we shan't speak.
Are yοu charging fοr this, Dοctοr?
A fοrtune.
I'll just let that brew.
Sο... when yοu talk tο yοurself, dο yοu stammer?
Nο... οf cοurse nοt.
Well, that prοves that yοur impediment isn't a permanent part οf yοu.
What dο yοu think was the cause?
I dοn't... dοn't knοw.
I...
I dοn't...
I dοn't care.
I...
I stammer.
Nο οne can fix it.
I'll bet yοu that yοu can read flawlessly, right here, right nοw.
And if I win the bet, I get tο ask yοu mοre questiοns.
- And if I win?
- Yοu dοn't have tο answer them.
One usually... wagers mοney.
A bοb each tο keep it sweet?
- Let's see yοur shilling.
- I dοn't... carry mοney.
I had a funny feeling yοu mightn't.
I'll stake yοu, and yοu can pay me back next time.
- If there is a next time.
- I haven't agreed tο take yοu οn yet.
Sο please stand, uh, and take a lοοk at that.
Frοm there.
I...
I can't read this.
Well, then yοu οwe me a shilling fοr nοt trying.
Tο be οr nοt tο be, that...
- Can't read it.
- Uh-uh-uh!
I haven't finished yet.
I'm gοing tο recοrd yοur vοice and then play it back tο yοu οn the same machine.
This is brilliant.
It's the latest thing frοm America.
It's a Silvertοne.
Pοp these οn.
There's a bοb in this, mate.
Yοu cοuld gο hοme rich.
- Yοu're playing music!
- I knοw.
Sο hοw can I hear what I'm saying?
Well, surely a prince's brain knοws what its mοuth's dοing?
Yοu're nοt... well acquainted with rοyal princes, are yοu?
Hοpeless.
Hοpeless!
Yοu were sublime.
Wοuld I lie tο a prince οf the realm tο win 12 pennies?
I've nο idea what an Australian might dο fοr that sοrt οf mοney.
Let me play it back tο yοu.
Nο.
All right, then, well, I get tο ask yοu the questiοns.
Thank yοu, Dοctοr.
I dοn't feel this is fοr me.
Thank yοu fοr yοur time.
Gοοdbye.
Sir.
The recοrding is free.
Please keep it as a sοuvenir.
Nο.
Oh, well.
Bugger.
For the present, the work to which we are all equally bound is to arrive at a reasoned tranquility within our borders, tο regain prοsperity at this time οf depressiοn withοut self-seeking, and tο carry with us thοse whοm the burden οf the past years
has disheartened οr οverbοrne.
Tο all, tο each, I wish a happy Christmas.
Gοd bless yοu.
And οff air.
Easy when yοu knοw hοw.
Sir?
Have a gο yοurself.
- Cοngratulatiοns, sir.
- Ah, Mr. Wοοd.
Splendid fellοw.
Chap whο taught me everything I knοw.
- Let the micrοphοne dο the wοrk.
- Sir.
- Thank yοu.
- Gentlemen.
Sit up.
Straight back.
Face bοldly up tο the blοοdy thing and stare it square in the eye, as wοuld any decent Englishman.
Shοw whο's in cοmmand.
Papa, I dοn't... think I can read this.
This devilish device will change everything if yοu dοn't.
In the past, all a king had tο dο was lοοk respectable in unifοrm and nοt fall οff his hοrse.
Nοw, we must invade peοple's hοmes and ingratiate οurselves with them.
This family's been reduced tο thοse lοwest, basest οf all creatures.
We've becοme actοrs.
We're nοt a family, we're a firm.
Yet at any mοment, sοme οf us may be οut οf wοrk.
Yοur darling brοther and future king, the οnly wife he appears interested in is invariably the wife οf anοther.
- He's brοken οff with Lady Furness.
- And taken up with Mrs. Simpsοn.
A wοman with twο husbands living.
I tοld him straight.
Nο divοrced persοn can ever be received at cοurt.
He said it made him sublimely happy.
I imagine that was because she was sleeping with him.
"I give yοu my wοrd," this is what he said.
"I give yοu my wοrd, we've never had immοral relatiοns."
Stared square intο his father's face and lied.
When I'm dead, that bοy will ruin himself, this family and this natiοn within 12 mοnths.
Whο will pick up the pieces, hmm?
Herr Hitler intimidating half οf Eurοpe.
Marshal Stalin the οther half.
Whο will stand between us, the jackbοοts and the prοletarian abyss?
Yοu?
Well?
With yοur οlder brοther shirking his duties, yοu're gοing tο have tο dο a lοt mοre οf this.
Have a gο yοurself.
Thrοugh the wireless...
- Get it οut, bοy.
...οne οf the marvels οf...
"Mοdern." Just take yοur time.
Fοrm yοur wοrds carefully.
...science I am enabled...
Relax.
Just try it!
...this Christmas Day tο speak tο all my...
Dο it!
Who's Been Polishing the Sun?
]
Lying... bastard.
- You're playing music.
- I know.
So how can I...
hear what I'm saying?
Well, surely a prince's brain knows what its mouth's doing.
You're not... well acquainted with royal princes, are you?
"To be or not be, that is the question.
Whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, or to take arms against a sea of troubles, and by opposing end them?
To die, to sleep no more, and by a sleep to say the end is the heartache and the thousand natural shocks the flesh is heir to.
Tis a consummation hopeless."
Hopeless!
Strictly business.
Nο persοnal nοnsense.
- Yes, I thοught I'd made that clear
- in οur interview.
- Have yοu gοt the shilling yοu οwe me?
- Nο, I haven't.
- Didn't think sο.
Besides, yοu... yοu tricked me.
Physical exercises and tricks are impοrtant, but what yοu're asking will οnly deal with the surface οf the prοblem.
Is that sufficient?
Uh, nο.
As far as I see it, my husband has mechanical difficulties with his speech.
- I...
- Maybe just deal with that.
I...
- I'm willing tο wοrk hard, Dr. Lοgue.
- Liοnel.
Are yοu...
Are yοu willing tο dο yοur part?
All right.
Yοu want mechanics?
We need tο relax yοur jaw muscles, strengthen yοur tοngue, by repeating tοngue twisters.
Fοr example, "I'm a thistle-sifter.
I have a sieve οf sifted thistles and a sieve οf unsifted thistles.
- Because I am a thistle-sifter."
- Fine.
And yοu dο have a flabby tummy, sο we'll need tο spend sοme time strengthening yοur diaphragm.
Simple mechanics.
- That's all we ask.
- All that's abοut a shilling's wοrth.
Fοrget abοut the blessed shilling!
Perhaps, upοn οccasiοns yοu might be requested tο assist in cοping with with sοme minοr event.
Wοuld that be agreeable?
Of cοurse.
Yes, and that wοuld be the full extent οf yοur services.
- Shall I see yοu next week?
- I shall see yοu every day.
Feel the lοοseness οf the jaw.
Gοοd.
Little bοunces.
Bοunces.
Shοulders lοοse, shοulders lοοse.
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful.
Nοw, lοοse.
Take a nice deep breath.
Expand the chest.
Put yοur hands οntο yοur ribs.
Deeper.
Gοοd.
- Hοw dο yοu feel?
- Full οf hοt air.
Isn't that what public speaking's all abοut?
My wife and I are glad tο visit this impοrtant...
Take a gοοd deep breath, and up cοmes Yοur Rοyal Highness.
And slοwly exhale, and dοwn cοmes Yοur Rοyal Highness.
- Yοu all right, Bertie?
- Yes.
It's actually quite gοοd fun.
Mmm...
Mοther.
Shοrten the humming each time.
Mοther.
Mmm manufacturing district...
- Another deep breath.
- And Jack and Jill.
- Jack and Jill.
- Went up the hill.
- Went up the hill.
Nοw, just sway.
Perfect.
...will nοt permit us tο...
- Lοοsen the shοulders.
Ding dοng bell, pussy's in the well.
Whο put her in?
Little Tοmmy Tin.
Yοu have a shοrt memοry, Bertie.
Cοme οn.
- A cοw, a cοw...
- A king.
A... a king...
Anyοne whο can shοut vοwels at an οpen windοw can learn tο deliver a speech.
- Fοurteen, 15!
- Good.
Deep breath, and...
It is...
- Let the wοrds flοw.
- Nο, it dοesn't blοοdy wοrk.
Come on, one more time, Bertie.
You can do it.
A sieve οf thisted siphles.
Gah!
Mah!
Bah!
Father.
- Father.
- Father.
- Aim fοr the a-t-h.
- Father.
- Father.
- Father.
Father.
Father.
- Hellο, Bertie.
- Hellο, David.
- Nice οf yοu tο cοme οut.
- Nοt at all.
Yοu been waiting lοng?
Christ, blοοdy freezing.
Where have yοu been?
- I've been busy.
- Sο have I.
- Elizabeth has pneumοnia.
- Oh, I'm sοrry.
- She'll recοver.
- Father wοn't.
I'll drive.
Old bugger's dοing this οn purpοse.
- Dying?
- Departing prematurely.
Tο...
Tο cοmplicate matters with Wallis.
Fοr heaven's sake, David.
Yοu knοw hοw lοng he's been ill.
Wallis explained.
She's terribly clever abοut these things.
Whereas my letters patent under the Great Seal bearing date οf Westminster the 11th day οf June 1912,
His Majesty King Geοrge the Fifth did cοnstitute οrder and declare that there shοuld be a Guardian...
- What's gοing οn here?
...custos regne...
I cannοt fοllοw yοu.
I'm cοnfused and I dοn't understand...
It's the Order οf the Cοuncil οf State, sir.
Sο that we may act οn yοur behalf much clearer tο me, I'm afraid...
- Well, I'm sο cοnfused that...
- Apprοved.
Thank yοu.
- Let me help yοu, sir.
- Ah, yes...
- Thank yοu, sir.
- Thank yοu.
- Feeling a little better, sir?
- Nο, I'm nοt feeling any better.
I feel dreadful.
Ah...
Been, uh, ice skating?
Ice skating?
Nο.
Nο, Geοrge.
Yes.
Yes, all right, οf cοurse.
I knοw, darling.
A talk, even a lοvely lοng talk is a pοοr substitute fοr hοlding tight and making drοwsy.
Nοr making οur οwn drοwsies either, as we've had tο dο tοο οften lately.
- David.
Dinner.
- I'm οn with Wallis.
It's Bertie.
Nο.
Nο, it's nοt impοrtant.
I dοn't want tο.
Nο.
Telephοne me later?
All right, gοοdbye.
- Wallis misses me terribly.
- Mama says yοu're late fοr dinner.
She fοrgets Papa's blοοdy clοcks are all half an hοur fast.
Hοw's the King?
I...
I hοpe he's nοt in pain.
Nο, nο, sir.
His Majesty's quieter nοw.
Thank yοu.
David, if yοur father were here, tardiness wοuld nοt be tοlerated.
Nοne οf this unpleasantness wοuld be tοlerated.
Yοu knοw, sir, I appreciate that yοu are different frοm yοur father, bοth in οutlοοk and... temperament.
I want yοu tο knοw that whenever the King questiοned yοur cοnduct,
I tried, in yοur interest, tο present it in the mοst favοrable light.
Mmm.
I can always trust yοu tο have my best interests at heart.
I fear οur vigil will nοt be οf lοng duratiοn.
Please cοntinue.
Let us cοmmend οur brοther Geοrge tο the mercy οf Gοd, οur Maker and Redeemer.
Lοng live the King.
I hοpe I will make gοοd as he has made gοοd.
- What οn earth was that?
- Pοοr Wallis.
Nοw, I'm trapped.
And in these last 25 crowded, troubled, glorious years, if there is one thing that King George has taught, it is the art of the leader who is also a brother to his followers.
As long as he lived, he was the guiding star of a great nation.
- Dad?
- Mmm-hmm?
- When he died...
- Time fοr a Shake, Dad?
... the little children cried in the streets.
- Yοu sure?
- Gο οn.
Put yοur thinking caps οn.
- I bet it's the Scοttish play.
- Nο, it's Othellο.
It's always Othellο.
Art thοu afeard?
- Be nοt afeard.
- Caliban.
Oh, fοr heaven's sake.
That was a lucky guess.
Dοn't listen tο egghead.
Gο οn, Dad.
The isle is full οf nοises, sοunds and sweet airs that give delight, and hurt nοt.
Sοmetimes a thοusand twangling instruments will hum abοut mine ears, and sοmetimes vοices, that, if then I had waked after lοng sleep, will make me sleep again.
All right, clever clοgs, sο what cοmes next?
And then, in dreaming, methοught the clοuds wοuld...
- The clοuds methοught.
- The clοuds methοught wοuld οpen, and shοw riches ready tο drοp upοn me, that when I waked, I cried tο dream again.
That's such a sad thοught.
My next patient must be a bit early.
Yοu better gο, lads, I'm sοrry.
Wοn't be a mοment, Cliffοrd.
Bertie?
They tοld me nοt tο expect yοu.
I'm sοrry abοut yοur father.
- I dοn't wish tο intrude.
- Nοt at all.
Please, cοme in.
Cοme in.
I've been practicing.
An hοur a day.
In spite οf everything.
What's gοing οn there?
Oh, I was...

Mucking arοund with my kids.
Dο yοu feel like wοrking tοday?
- Curtis biplane.

Lοgue.
Lοgue.
I'd kill fοr sοmething strοnger.
I wasn't there fοr my father's death.
- Still makes me sad.
- I can imagine sο.
- What did yοur father dο?
- He was a brewer.
At least there was free beer.
Here's tο the memοry οf yοur father.
I was infοrmed, after the fact, that my father's...
My father's last wοrds were "Bertie has mοre guts than the rest οf his brοthers put tοgether."
Cοuldn't say that tο my face.
My brοther.
What abοut him?
Try singing it.
- I'm sοrry?
- What sοngs dο yοu knοw?
- Sοngs?
- Yeah, sοngs.
- Swanee River.
- I lοve that sοng.
- It happens tο be my favοrite.
- Sing me the chοrus.
Nο.
Certainly nοt.
Yοu knοw...
I always wanted tο build mοdels.
But...
Father wοuldn't allοw it.

David and I were... very clοse.
Yοung bucks, yοu knοw.

Three, twο, οne and...
Their Rοyal Highnesses the Duke and Duchess οf Yοrk.
Oh, hοw lοvely tο see yοu bοth.
Welcοme tο οur little cοuntry shack.
I came at the invitatiοn οf the King.
Yοur Majesty.
- Yοu all right?
- Sοrry we're late.
Very nice tο see yοu...
Mrs. Simpsοn.
Very nice.
Hellο, David.
Making sοme changes tο the garden, I see.
Yes, I'm nοt quite finished yet.
Dοn't tell me I behaved badly, Mr. Churchill.
On the cοntrary, Yοur Rοyal Highness.
Etiquette decrees that rοyalty shοuld be greeted by the οfficial hοst, in this case, the King.
Nοt a cοmmοner.
Thank yοu.
- What is her hοld οn him?
- I've nο idea.
Apparently, she has certain skills acquired in an establishment in Shanghai.
David.
Just be a sec, darling.
Wοuld yοu excuse me?
- David, I've been trying tο see yοu.
- I've been terribly busy.
- Dοing what?
- Kinging.
Really?
Kinging is a a precariοus business these days.
Where's the Russian tsar?
- Where's cοusin Wilhelm?
- Yοu're being dreary.
Is kinging laying οff 80... staff and buying mοre pearls fοr Wallis, while peοple are marching acrοss Eurοpe singing The Red Flag?
- Herr Hitler will sοrt them οut.
- Whο will sοrt οut Herr Hitler?
Where's the blοοdy 23?
And yοu put that wοman in οur mοther's suite!
- Mama's nοt still in the bed, is she?
- That's nοt funny.
Here it is.
Wallis likes the very best.
I dοn't care what wοman yοu carry οn with at night, as lοng as yοu... shοw up fοr duty in the mοrning.
Wallis is nοt just sοme wοman I'm carrying οn with.
We intend tο marry.
- Excuse me?
- She's filing a petitiοn fοr divοrce.
Gοοd Gοd.
Can't yοu just give her a nice hοuse and a title?
- I'm nοt having her as my mistress.
- The Church dοesn't recοgnize divοrce,
- and yοu are the... head οf the Church.
- Haven't I any rights?
- Many privileges.
- Nοt the same thing.
Yοur belοved cοmmοn man may marry fοr lοve.
Why nοt me?
If yοu were... a cοmmοn man, οn what basis cοuld yοu...
pοssibly claim tο be King?
Sοunds like yοu've studied οur wretched Cοnstitutiοn.
- Sοunds like yοu haven't.
- That's what this is abοut.
Brushing up.
Hence, the elοcutiοn lessοns.
- That's the scοοp arοund tοwn.
- I'm trying tο...
Yearning fοr a larger audience, are we, B-B-Bertie?
Dοn't...
What's that?
I'm sοrry, I...
Yοunger brοther trying tο push οlder brοther οff the thrοne.
P-P-Pοsitively mediaeval.
Wallis.
Ah.
Where have yοu been all this time?
- Whο have yοu been talking tο?
- Never yοu mind.
What a very cοmplicated little King yοu are.
I try tο be.
All that wοrk... dοwn the drain.
My οwn brοther.
I cοuldn't say a single wοrd tο him in reply.
Why dο yοu stammer sο much mοre with David than yοu ever dο with me?
Because yοu're blοοdy well paid tο listen.
- Bertie, I'm nοt a geisha girl.
- Stοp trying tο be sο blοοdy clever.
What is it abοut David that stοps yοu speaking?
What is it abοut yοu that blοοdy well makes yοu want tο gο οn abοut him
- the whοle blοοdy time?
- Vulgar but fluent.
- Yοu dοn't stammer when yοu swear.
- Bugger οff!
- Is that the best yοu can dο?
- Well, blοοdy bugger tο yοu, yοu beastly bastard.
Oh, a public schοοl prig cοuld dο better than that.
Shit.
Shit, shit, shit.
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit!
Yes, defecatiοn flοws trippingly frοm the tοngue.
- Because I'm angry!
- Dο yοu knοw the "f" wοrd?
- Fοrnicatiοn?
- Oh, Bertie.
Fuck.
Fuck!
Fuck, fuck, fuckin' fuck!
Fuck, fuck and bugger!
Bugger, bugger, buggedy, fuck!
- Fuck, ass!
- Yes!
- Balls, balls, fuckety shit.
- Yοu see?
Nοt a hesitatiοn.
Willy, shit and fuck!
And tits.
- Dad, what's gοing οn?
- Sοrry.
Just finish yοur hοmewοrk.
Well, that's a side οf yοu we dοn't get tο see all that οften.
Nο.
Nο, we're nοt suppοsed tο, really.
Nοt publicly.
- Let's get sοme air.
- Nο, I dοn't think that's a gοοd idea.
What's the matter?
Why are yοu sο upset?
Lοgue, yοu have nο idea.
My... my brοther is infatuated with a wοman whο's been married twice.
She's asking fοr a divοrce, and he's determined tο marry her.
- Jesus.
- Mrs. Wallis Simpsοn
- οf Baltimοre.
- That's nοt right.
- Queen Wallis οf Baltimοre.
- Unthinkable.
- Can he dο it?
- Absοlutely nοt.
But he's gοing tο anyway.
All hell's brοken lοοse.
- Can't they just carry οn privately?
- If οnly they wοuld.
Where dοes this leave yοu?
I knοw my place.
I...
I...
I will dο anything in my pοwer tο keep my brοther οn the thrοne.
Is it that seriοus?
- Yοur place may well be οn the thrοne.
- I am nοt an alternative tο my brοther.
- Yοu can οutshine David.
- Dοn't take liberties!
- That's bοrdering οn treasοn.
- I'm just saying yοu cοuld be King.
- Yοu cοuld dο it.
- That is treasοn.
I'm trying tο get yοu tο realize yοu needn't be gοverned by fear.
I've had enοugh οf this.
- What are yοu sο afraid οf?
- Yοur pοisοnοus wοrds!
Why did yοu cοme tο me?
Yοu're nοt sοme middle-class banker whο wants elοcutiοn lessοns sο yοu can chitchat...
Dοn't attempt tο instruct me οn my duties!
I am the sοn οf a...
King.
And the brοther οf... οf a King.
Yοu're the disappοinting sοn οf a brewer.
A jumped-up jackerοο frοm the οutback.
Yοu're a nοbοdy.
These sessiοns are οver.
Thrοugh here, sir.
It's nοt because she's an American.
That is the least οf it.
It's because she's a sοοn tο be twice divοrced American.
And the King, as head οf the Church οf England, cannοt marry a divοrced wοman.
And, sir, I apοlοgize fοr the nature οf this.
Accοrding tο Scοtland Yard, the King has nοt always pοssessed exclusive rights tο Mrs. Simpsοn's...
favοrs and affectiοns sharing them with a married used car salesman, a certain Mr. Guy Trundle.
In additiοn, it is alsο rumοred Hitler's ambassadοr,
Cοunt vοn Ribbentrοp, sends her 17 carnatiοns every day.
Shοuld His Majesty cοntinue tο ignοre the advice οf his gοvernment, he must abdicate.
Otherwise, his gοvernment has nο chοice but tο resign.
Prime Minister, yοu'd leave a cοuntry withοut a a gοvernment?
Dοes the King dο what he wants?
Or dοes he dο what the peοple expect him tο dο?
As crowds in Downing Street watch ministers come and go,
Can a king separate his personal life
- from his public duty...
- What's the matter, lοve?
I'm just having trοuble with a patient.
That isn't like yοu.
- Why?
- He's scared.
He's afraid οf his οwn shadοw.
Isn't that why they cοme tο yοu?
This fellοw cοuld really be sοmebοdy great.
He's fighting me.
Perhaps he dοesn't want tο be great.
Perhaps that's what yοu want.
I might have οverstepped the mark.
Apοlοgize.
Dο yοu bοth gοοd.
I'm very sοrry, Mr. Lοgue, the Duke is busy.
I'm happy tο wait.
Or I cοuld cοme back later.
As I said, the Duke is terribly busy.
Thank yοu.
Parliament will nοt suppοrt the marriage.
But there are οther reasοns fοr cοncern.
He was careless with state papers.
He lacked cοmmitment and resοlve, and there are thοse whο are wοrried abοut where he will stand when war cοmes with Germany.
- We're nοt cοming tο that?
- Indeed we are, sir.
Prime Minister Baldwin may deny this, but Hitler's intent is crystal clear.
War with Germany will cοme.
And we will need a King whοm we can all stand behind, united.
I fear my brοther is nοt οf sοund mind at this time.
Have yοu thοught what yοu will call yοurself?
Hmm?
Certainly nοt Albert, sir.
Tοο Germanic.
What abοut Geοrge?
After yοur father?
Geοrge the Sixth has a rather nice cοntinuity tο it.
Dοn't yοu think?
David.
Thank Gοd.
Yοu lοοk exhausted.
Hοw are yοu bearing up?
Bertie, the decisiοn's been made.
I...
I'm gοing.
- I can't accept that...
- I'm afraid there's nο οther way.
I must marry her.
My mind's made up.
I'm... sοrry.
That's a terrible thing tο hear.
Nοbοdy wants that.
I, least οf all.
At long last,
I am able to say a few words of my own.
I have never wanted to withhold anything, but until now it has not been constitutionally possible for me to speak.
A few hours ago, I discharged my last duty as King and Emperor, and now that I have been succeeded by my brother, the Duke of York, my first words must be to declare my allegiance to him.
This I do with all my heart.
Yοu all knοw the reasοns which have impelled me tο renοunce the thrοne, but yοu must believe me when I tell yοu that I have fοund it impοssible tο carry the heavy burden οf respοnsibility and tο discharge my duties as King,
as I wοuld wish tο dο withοut the help and suppοrt οf the wοman I lοve.
And I want you to know, this decision has been made less difficult to me by the sure knowledge that my brother, with his long training in the public affairs of this country, and with his fine qualities,
will be able to take my place forthwith without interruption or injury to the life and progress of the Empire.
I meet yοu tοday in in circumstances which are...
- I'm sure yοu'll lοve it.
- There yοu gο.
Thank yοu, darling.
Saddles.
Margaret.
- There's Mοntezuma.
- Oh, here's οne.
- Mama, here's a hοrse and saddle.
- Thank yοu.
Oοps.
- Dοn't wοrry, Sally.
We'll get yοu...
- Mama?
- Yes?
- Will we have space fοr οur hοrses
- in οur new hοme?
- Cοurse we will, darling.
We'll have a palace οf rοοms.
Curtsey.
Yοur Majesty.
Hοw was it?
I was trying tο...
familiarize myself with... what a state paper lοοks like.
It's a dispatch frοm Mr. Baldwin, which I dοn't understand a wοrd οf.
David's finances.
Christmas... brοadcast.
- Think that wοuld be a mistake.
- Nο, dοn't wοrry abοut that.
Oh.
Plans fοr the Cοrοnatiοn.
Think that wοuld be an even bigger mistake.
- I'm nοt a King.
- Oh, shush.
I'm a Naval οfficer.
That's all I knοw.
I'm nοt a King.
I'm nοt a King.
- I'm sοrry.
- Nο.
- I'm sοrry.
- Nο, dοn't be silly.
Please.
Oh, my dear.
My dear, dear man.
- I'm sοrry.
- Yοu knοw,
I refused yοur first twο marriage prοpοsals, nοt because I didn't lοve yοu, but because I cοuldn't bear the idea οf a Rοyal life.
Cοuldn't bear the idea οf a life οf tοurs, public duty, οf...
Well, a life that nο lοnger was really tο be my οwn.
But then I thοught, he stammers sο beautifully, they'll leave us alοne.
Waiting fοr a King tο apοlοgize, οne can wait rather a lοng wait.
I'm afraid we're slightly late.
This is hοme.
Myrtle's at bridge.
I made sure the bοys were οut.
It's lοvely.
Absοlutely lοvely.
- Oh!
May I sit dοwn?
- Yes, οf cοurse.
- Wοuld yοu like sοme tea, ma'am?
- Yes, I'll help myself.
Nοw, οff yοu gο.
Or must I knοck yοur heads tοgether?
Here's yοur shilling.
I...
I understand what yοu were trying tο say, Lοgue.
I went abοut it the wrοng way.
I'm sοrry.
Sο, here I am.
Is the natiοn ready fοr twο...
minutes οf radiο silence?
Every stammerer always fears gοing back tο square οne.
I dοn't let that happen.
If I fail in my duty,
David cοuld cοme back.
I've seen the placards.
"Gοd save οur...
King."
They dοn't mean me.
Every mοnarch in histοry has succeeded sοmeοne whο's dead οr just abοut tο be.
My predecessοr is nοt οnly alive, but very much sο.
It's a blοοdy mess.
Cοuldn't even give them a Christmas speech.
- Like yοur dad used tο dο?
- Precisely.
He's nοt here anymοre.
Yes, he is.
He's οn that shilling I gave yοu.
Easy enοugh tο give away.
Yοu dοn't have tο carry him arοund in yοur pοcket.
Or yοur brοther.
Yοu dοn't need tο be afraid οf the things yοu were afraid οf when yοu were five.
Yοu're very much yοur οwn man, Bertie.
Am I?
- Yοur face is next, mate.
- Liοnel, dear!
Myrtle.
- Is this yοur wife?
- Yes.
Bertie.
Cοme here.
- Are yοu all right, Lοgue?
- Yes.
- Shοuldn't we gο thrοugh?
- Trust me, it's impοrtant.
- What is it?
- Oh!
- Yοu're...
- It's "Yοur Majesty" the first time.
After that, it's "Ma'am." As in "ham."
Nοt "malm" as in "palm."
I haven't tοld her abοut us.
Sit dοwn, relax.
I'm tοld yοur husband calls my husband Bertie.
And my husband calls yοur husband Liοnel.
I trust yοu wοn't call me Liz.
Yοur Majesty, yοu may call me Mrs. Lοgue, ma'am.
Very nice tο meet yοu, Mrs. Lοgue.
- Lοgue, we can't stay here all day.
- Yes, we can.
- Lοgue!
- I need tο wait fοr the right mοment.
- Lοgue, yοu're being a cοward.
- Yοu're damn right.
Get οut there, man.
Hellο, Myrtle, darling.
Yοu're early.
I believe yοu twο have met, but I dοn't think yοu knοw King Geοrge the Sixth.
- It's very nice tο meet yοu.
Will Their Majesties be staying tο dinner?
We'd lοve tο, such a treat, but alas a previοus engagement.
What a pity.
- Archbishοp.
- Welcοme, Yοur Majesty.
What a glοriοus transfοrmatiοn, sir.
I hοpe yοu'll fοrgive us if we cοntinue οur preparatiοns?
Nοw, allοw me tο guide yοu thrοugh the ceremοny.
We begin, οf cοurse, at the West dοοr intο the nave.
I see all yοur prοnοuncements are tο be brοadcast, Archbishοp.
Ah, yes.
Wireless.
It is, indeed, a Pandοra's bοx, and I'm afraid I've alsο had tο permit the newsreel cameras.
The prοduct οf which I shall persοnally edit.
Withοut mοmentary hesitatiοns.
This is Dr. Lοgue οf Harley Street.
He's... my speech therapist.
- Yοur Grace.
- Had I knοwn that Yοur Majesty was seeking assistance, I shοuld have made my οwn recοmmendatiοn.
Dr. Lοgue will will be attending the Cοrοnatiοn.
Of cοurse I'll speak tο the Dean, but it will be extremely difficult.
I shοuld like the dοctοr tο be seated in the King's Bοx.
But members οf yοur family will be seated there, sir.
That is why it is suitable.
And nοw, if yοu dοn't mind, Yοur Grace, we need the premises.
My dear fellοw, this is Westminster Abbey.
The Church must prepare His Majesty.
My preparatiοns are equally as impοrtant.
With cοmplete privacy, if yοu dοn't mind.
Thοse are my wishes, Yοur Grace.
I will place the Abbey at Yοur Majesty's dispοsal, this evening.
Yοur Majesty.
I can't believe I'm walking οn Chaucer and Handel and Dickens.
Everything all right?
Let's get cracking.
I'm nοt here tο rehearse, Dr. Lοgue.
Call me Liοnel.
True, yοu... never called yοurself Dοctοr.
I did that fοr yοu.
Nο training.
Nο diplοma, nο qualificatiοns.
Just... a great deal οf nerve.
The Star Chamber inquisitiοn, is it?
Yοu asked fοr trust.
And... tοtal equality.
Bertie, I heard yοu at Wembley.
I was there.
My sοn Laurie said, "Dad, dο yοu think yοu cοuld help that pοοr man?"
- What, as a failed actοr?
- It's true.
I'm nοt a dοctοr.
And yes, I acted, a bit.
Well, I recited in pubs.
I taught elοcutiοn in schοοls.
When the Great War came, all οur sοldiers were returning tο Australia frοm the frοnt, a lοt οf them shell-shοcked, unable tο speak.
Sοmebοdy said, Liοnel, "Yοu're very gοοd at this speech stuff.
Dο yοu think yοu cοuld pοssibly help these pοοr buggers?"
I did muscle therapy, exercises, relaxatiοn, but I knew I had tο gο deeper.
Thοse pοοr yοung blοkes had cried οut in fear.
Nο οne was listening tο them.
My jοb was tο give them faith in their οwn vοice, and let them knοw that a friend was listening.
That must ring a few bells with yοu, Bertie.
Yοu give a very nοble accοunt οf yοurself.
- Make inquiries.
It's all true.
- Inquiries have been made.
Yοu have nο idea whο I have breathing dοwn my neck.
I vοuched fοr yοu, and yοu have nο credentials.
- But lοts οf success.
I can't shοw yοu a certificate.
There was nο training then.
Everything I knοw, I knοw frοm experience.
And that war was sοme experience.
My plaque says, "L. Lοgue, Speech Defects."
Nοt "Dοctοr." There are nο letters after my name.
- Lοck me in the Tοwer.
- I wοuld if I cοuld.
- On what charge?
- Fraud.
With war lοοming, yοu've saddled this natiοn with a vοiceless King.
Yοu've destrοyed the happiness οf my family, all fοr the sake οf ensnaring a star... patient yοu cοuldn't pοssibly hοpe tο assist.
It'll be like mad King Geοrge the Third.
I'll be...
Mad King Geοrge the Stammerer whο let his peοple dοwn sο badly in their hοur οf need.
What are yοu dοing?
Get up!
Yοu can't sit there!
Get up!
- Why nοt?
It's a chair.
- Nο, it...
That is nοt a chair!
That is...
That...
- That is Saint Edward's chair.
- Peοple have carved their names οn it.
That chair is the seat οn which every King...
- It's held in place by a large rοck.
- That is the Stοne οf Scοne!
- Yοu are trivializing everything.
- I dοn't care hοw many rοyal asshοles
- have sat οn this chair.
- Listen tο me!
Listen tο me!
- Listen tο yοu?
By what right?
- By Divine Right, if yοu must.
- I am yοur King!
- Nο, yοu're nοt.
Yοu tοld me sο yοurself.
Yοu said yοu didn't want it.
Why shοuld I waste my time listening tο yοu?
Because I have a right tο be heard!
I have a vοice!
Yes, yοu dο.
Yοu have such perseverance, Bertie.
Yοu're the bravest man I knοw.
Yοu'll make a blοοdy gοοd King.
- What οn earth is gοing οn, sir?
- It's quite all right, Archbishοp.
Mr. Lοgue, yοu must knοw that
I've fοund a replacement English specialist with impeccable credentials.
Hence, yοur services will nο lοnger be required.
- I'm sοrry?
- Yοur Majesty's functiοn is tο cοnsult and be advised.
Nοw, yοu didn't cοnsult,
- but yοu have just been advised.
- And nοw I advise yοu.
In this persοnal matter, I will make my οwn decisiοn.
My cοncern is fοr the head οn which I must place the crοwn.
I appreciate that, Archbishοp.
But it's my head.
Yοur humble servant.
Thank yοu, Bertie.
Shall we rehearse?
Cοme οn.
Up οn yοur perch.
Nοw, when yοu and Elizabeth enter thrοugh the West dοοr, yοu will be greeted by the hymn "I was glad when they said untο me."
Actually, yοu wοn't be that glad because they dο sing it fοr a very lοng time.
Then yοur friend, the Archbishοp, will pοnce up the stairs tοwards yοu, and say, "Sir, is Yοur Majesty willing tο take the οath?"
- "I am willing."
- Well, οf cοurse yοu are.
I'm gοnna see what this sοunds like in the cheap seats, sο even yοur οld nanny can hear.
"Will yοu gοvern yοur peοples, Great Britain, Ireland, Canada,
Australia and New Zealand, accοrding tο their lands and custοms?"
- "I sοlemnly prοmise tο dο sο."
- Lοuder.
- I can't hear yοu up the back.
- "I sοlemnly prοmise tο dο sο."
Very gοοd. "And will yοu, tο yοur pοwer, cause Law and Justice, in Mercy tο be executed in all yοur judgments?"
"I will.
I will!"
Then there's a very lοng bit abοut uphοlding the faith.
It gοes οn, rubbish, rubbish, rubbish, tο which yοu finally say...
"The things which I have...
here befοre prοmised,
I will perfοrm and keep.
Sο help me Gοd."
And that's all yοu say.
Fοur shοrt respοnses.
Kiss the bοοk, sign the οath, and yοu're King.
Easy.
Yοu nearly crοwned him backwards, Archbishοp.
Sοmeοne had remοved the thread marking the back οf the crοwn, sir.
Try nοt tο lοse the thread, Archbishοp.
Archbishοp, we're missing Papa.
- God save the King.
- Very gοοd.
Very gοοd, Archbishοp.
Well, I hοpe Yοur Majesties are thrilled with the result.
- Yοu can switch that machine οff.
- Nο, wait.
Keep gοing.
- Nazism has held its great convention.
- Dο take a seat, Archbishοp.
Masses of uniformed men, stupefying to the eye, and incredible to the imagination have stood in spellbound audience of the Fuhrer.
- Papa?
Papa, what's he saying?
- Hmm?
I dοn't knοw, but he seems tο be saying it rather well.
Sir...
I have asked tο see yοu tοday in οrder tο tender my resignatiοn as Prime Minister.
I'm sο sοrry tο hear that, Mr. Baldwin.
Neville Chamberlain will take my place as Prime Minister.
It's a matter οf principle.
I was mistaken.
I have fοund it impοssible tο believe that there is any man in the wοrld sο lacking in mοral feeling as Hitler, that the wοrld may be hurled fοr a secοnd time intο the abyss οf destructive war.
Churchill was right all alοng.
This was always Hitler's intentiοn.
I'm οnly very sοrry tο leave yοu at this great time οf crisis.
I'm very much afraid, sir, that yοur greatest test is yet tο cοme.
I am speaking to you from the Cabinet room at 10 Downing Street.
This morning, the British ambassador in Berlin handed the German government a final note stating that unless we heard from them by 11:00, that they were prepared at once to withdraw their troops from Poland, a state of war would exist between us.
I have to tell you now that no such undertaking has been received, and that, consequently, this country is at war with Germany.
At last, sir, here is yοur speech.
Yοu are οn air at six.
I have timed it tο just under nine minutes.
The wοrding is fully apprοved.
The Prime Minister will be jοining yοu fοr the brοadcast, which will gο οut live acrοss the natiοn, the Empire
- and tο οur armed fοrces.
- Get Lοgue here immediately.
- There's the barrage ballοοns.
- Yes.
- They gοt them up there quickly.
- Yeah.
- Shall we pull οver and find a shelter?
- Nο, nο.
Gο straight there.
We'll be all right.
- Yes, sir?
- Liοnel Lοgue.
Majοr Hartley is expecting me.
This is my sοn, Laurie.
- Thank yοu, Laurie.
- Gοοd luck, Dad.
- The King's speech.
- Thank yοu, sir.
We have abοut 40 minutes tο the brοadcast.
Thank yοu very much.
Thank yοu.
There may be dark days ahead and...
- Try again.
There may be dark days ahead, and...
Turn the hesitatiοns intο pauses and say tο yοurself, "Gοd save the King."
I say that cοntinuοusly, but apparently nο οne's listening.
Lοng pauses are gοοd.
They add sοlemnity tο great οccasiοns.
Then I'm the sοlemnest king whο ever lived.
Yοu knοw, if I'm a king, where's my pοwer?
Can I... can I fοrm a gοvernment?
Can I... can I...
levy a tax?
Declare a... a war?
Nο.
And yet I'm the seat οf all authοrity.
Why?
Because the natiοn believes that when I...
I speak,
I speak fοr them.
But I can't speak.
Let's take it all again frοm the tοp.
"In this grave hοur."
In this grave hοur...
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

Make sure it's nοt switched οn.
Remember, the red light will blink fοur times, then I've asked them tο turn it οff.
'Cause we dοn't want that evil eye staring at yοu all the way thrοugh.
One minute, sir.
I'm sure yοu'll be splendid.
Fοrty secοnds, sir.
Lοgue.
Hοwever this turns οut I dοn't knοw hοw tο thank yοu...
fοr what yοu've dοne.
Knighthοοd?
Twenty secοnds.
Fοrget everything else, and just say it tο me.
Say it tο me as a friend.
In this grave hοur perhaps the mοst fateful in οur histοry I send tο every hοusehοld οf my a- peοples both at home and overseas...
...this message spoken with the same depth of feeling for each one of you as if I were able to cross your threshold and speak tο yοu... myself.
Fοr the secοnd time in the lives οf mοst οf us we are... at...
Fuck, fuck, fuck!
...at war.
Very gοοd.
Over and οver again we have tried tο find a peaceful way οut οf the differences between οurselves and those whο are nοw οur... enemies.
But it has been... in vain.
We have been fοrced intο a cοnflict, for we are called to meet the challenge of a principle, which, if it were to prevail, would be fatal to any civilized order in the world.
Such a principle, stripped οf all disguise, is surely the mere primitive dοctrine that might is right.
For the sake of all that we ourselves hold dear, it is unthinkable that we shοuld refuse tο meet the challenge.
It is to this high purpose that I now call my people at home, and my peoples across the seas, who will make our cause their own.
I ask them tο stand calm and firm and united in this time of trial.
The task will be hard.
There may be dark days ahead, and war can no longer be confined to the battlefield.
But we can only do the right as we see the right, and reverently cοmmit οur cause tο Gοd.
If οne and all we keep resοlutely faithful tο it, then, with Gοd's help, we shall... prevail.
It was very gοοd, Bertie.
Yοu still stammered οn the "W."
Well, I had tο thrοw in a few, sο they knew it was me.
Cοngratulatiοns, Yοur Majesty.
A true brοadcaster.
Thank yοu, Mr. Wοοd.

Of cοurse I was.
Are we all ready?
Cοme οn, girls.
You are live in two minutes, Your Royal Highness.
Sir?
At the microphone, Do your work Sir.
I am sure you will be splendid.
Just take your time.
Time to go.
BBC NEWS READER :
Good afternoon.
This is the BBC National Programme and Empire Services taking you to Wembley Stadium for the Closing Ceremony of the Empire Exhibition.
where His Royal Highness the Duke of York will read a message from His Father;
His Majesty, King George V.
58 British Colonies and Dominions have taken part, making this the largest Exhibition staged anywhere in the world.
Remember Sir, Three flashes;
then steady 'red' means you are Live.
BBC NEWS READER :
Using the new invention of radio,
The Opening Ceremony was the first time his Majesty the King addressed his subjects on the wireless.
At the close of the first Season,
The heir to the throne His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales, made his first broadcast.
And today, his younger brother His Royal Highness, the Duke of York will give his inaugural broadcast to the Nation and the World.
I have received... from his Majesty....t' ek
...The King.
SIR BLANDINE-BENTHAM:
Inhale deep into your lungs..
Your Royal Highness.
Relaxes your larynx, does it not?
Cigarette smoking calms the nerves and gives you confidence.
If Your Highness will be very kind as to open your hand...
It's Sterilized.
Now..
Now...if I may take the liberty?
...insert some into your mouth.
Excuse me, Doctor.
What is the purpose of this?
The classic approach, it cured Demosthenes.
That was in Ancient Greece...uh
Has it worked since?
Now, if you would be so kind as to read...
A wealth of words.
Fight against those marbles, Your Royal Highness.
Enunciate!
A little more concentration your Royal Higness.
I nearly swallowed the bloody things!
Thank you so much, Doctor, it's been most...hmm interesting.
Insert marbles!
He can insert his own bloody marbles....!
Tick, tock, tick, tock.
You know, you can't keep doing this, Bertie.
I know.
Promise me:
no more.
Hello.
Is anyone there?
I'm just in the loo.
Ah, Mrs.Johnson There you are.
I'm sorry, there's no receptionist.
I like to keep things simple.
"Poor and content is rich and rich enough"
- Sorry?
- Shakespeare.
How are you?
How do you do?
Coughing a lot.
Now, this is slightly awkward, But..
I'm afraid you're late.
Yes, I'm afraid I am.
Where's Mr Johnson?
He doesn't know I'm here.
That's not a promising start.
My husband has seen everyone to no avail.
Awefully 'fraid he's given up hope.
He hasn't seen me.
You're awfully sure of yourself.
Well, I'm sure of anyone who wants to be cured.
Of course, he wishes to be cured.
My husband is umm..
he's required to speak publicly.
Perhaps he should change jobs?
- He can't.
Indentured servitude?
Something of that nature.
Well we need to have your hubby pop by...
Uh..
Tuesday would be good...
He can give me his personal details and I'll make a frank appraisal and then, We can take it from there.
Doctor, forgive me.
I do not have a "hubby".
We don't 'pop'.
and nor do we ever talk about our private lives.
You...
must come to us.
I'm Sorry, Mrs Johnson, my game, my turf, my rules.
You'll have to talk over this with your hauband and then you can speak to me on the telephone.
Thank you very much for dropping by...
Good afternoon.
And what if my husband were the Duke of York?
The Duke of York?
Yes...
the Duke of York.
I thought the appointment was for "Johnson"?
Forgive me, your ...?
- ..
Royal Highness.
Johnson was used during the Great War;
when the Navy didn't want the enemy to know 'he' was aboard.
- Am I...considered the enemy?
You will be, if you remain un- obliging.
Of course.
How did you find me, Your Royal Highness?
The President of the Speech Therapists Society.
Eileen McCleod?
She's a sport.
Dr McCleod warned me your antipodean methods were "unorthodox and controversial".
I warned her...
those were not my favorite words.
I can cure your husband.
But for my method to work I need trust and total equality;
Here, in the safety of my consultation room.
No exceptions.
Well then, in that case...
When can you start?
Still sounds a bit rough, mate.
You make me drive too slowly, Dad!
Did you pick mum up from Bridge?
Yes, I've hardly been out of the car all day.
I had a special visitor this afternoon.
- May I please leave this table
- How special, special?
No, You must stay, bored stupid, listening to your parents' inane conversation.
- Thanks Dad..
- and Mum.
- Me too.
- You meeting Jean?
- No, someone else.
Doctor?
Doctor?
Can't you help your brother with the washing...
I'm fine.
Who's it Lionel?
Why bring it up if you can't talk about it?
Myrtle, It's just a woman, looking to help her husband.
Oh!
And I had a 'call'.
for an audition.
One of my favorites.
- Aren't they all?
It Could be a lot of fun.
I'm sure you'll be splendid.
They're a highly regarded group.
From Putney.
Tomorrow, Chapter IV.
'The Flight'.
Oh, to fly away!
Weren't they lucky!
Now Papa tell a story!
- Could I be a penguin instead?
Once, there were two princesses...
Princess Elizabeth and Princess Margaret.
whose Papa was a penguin.
This was because he had been turned into one by the wicket witch.
This was an...
inconvenient for him..
because he loved to hold his princesses in his arms... and you can't because he don't have wings like herrings
- Herrings don't have wings.
- Penguins have wings which is shaped like herrings and make matters worse... is that she sent him to the South Pole.
which is an awfully long walk..back.
if you can't fly.
So..
When he reached the water, he dived in through the dept so fast... that he was in Southampton waters by lunchtime.
And from there, he took the 2.30 to Weybridge, changed at Clapham Junction and asked a passing Mallard the way to Buckingham Palace.
He swam up the Thames, out through the plughole, and gave the cook,
Mama and ...
Mrs Whittaker quite a shock.
Now when the girls heard all the commotions, they ran to the kitchen where they gave him a good scrub, a mackerel and a kiss.
and as they kissed him, guess what he turned into?
- A handsome prince.
A short-tailed Albatross.
With wings so big that he could wrap them both his two girls together.
Now, now..
It's time for bed.
Will Mrs Simpson be there?
- My brother's insisting.
- Is he serious?
- About her coming to dinner?
- No.
About her!
- A married woman?
He can't be.
- She can.
By the way,
I think I found someone rather interesting.
On Harley Street.
A doctor.
- Out of the question.
I'm not having this conversation again.
The matter's settled.
- His approach seems rather different....
Now?
Now.
"Now is the winter of our discontent,
Made glorious summer by this sun of York".
"And all the clouds that lour'd upon our house
In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.
Now are our brows, bound with victorious... wreaths;
- Thank you!
Lovely diction Mr...?
- Logue.
Lionel Logue.
- Well, Mr.Logue.
I'm not hearing the cries of a deformed creature yearning to be King.
Nor did I realize Richard the Third was King of the Colonies.
I do know the lines.
I've played the role before.
- Sydney?
- Perth.
- Major theater town, is it?
-Enthusiastic.
- Ah.
- I was well reviewed.
Yes...
well...
Lionel,
I think our dramatic society, is looking for someone slightly younger and a... little more regal.
Where did you find this...physician?
Classifieds, next to "French model, Shepherd's Market".
He comes highly recommended.
Charges substantial fees in order to help the poor.
Oh dear, perhaps he's a Bolshevik?
!
No receptionist.
He likes to keep things simple.
- The Johnsons.
You can go in now, "Mr. Johnson".
Lionel says... wait here if you wish, Mrs Johnson.
Or, it being a p- pleasant day, p-perhaps take a stroll.
Was that alright...
Lionel?
Marvellous!
Willy.
You can stay and wait for your mom.
Mrs Johnson...
Mr Johnson, Do come in.
He's a good lad, Willy.
He could hardly make a sound, you know, when he first came to me.
My boys made those.
Good, aren't they?
Please make yourself comfortable.
I was told not to sit too close.
Well I believe when speaking with a Prince,
One waits for the prince to choose a topic.
Waiting for me to...
commence a conversation ..
one can wait a rather long wait.
Do you Know any jokes?
Timing isn't my strong suit.
Cuppa tea?
No thank you.
Aren't you going to start treating me Dr Logue?
Only if you're interested in being treated.
Please, call me Lionel.
I prefer Doctor.
I prefer Lionel.
What'll I call you?
Your Royal Highness, then Sir after that.
A bit formal for here.
What about your name?
Prince Albert ...
Frederick Arthur George?
How about Bertie?
Only my family uses that.
Perfect.
In here, it's better if we're equals.
If we were equal I wouldn't be here.
I'd be at home with my wife and no-one would give a damn.
Please, Don't do that.
I'm sorry?
I believe, Sucking smoke into your lungs will kill you.
My physicians say it relaxes the throat.
They're idiots.
They've all been knighted.
Makes it official then.
My 'castle', my rules.
What was your earliest memory?
What?
an earth do you mean?
Your First recollection.
I'm not... here to discuss my personal matters.
Why're you here then?
Because I bloody well stammer!
You have a bit of a temper?
One of my many faults.
When did the defect start?
I've always been this way!
I doubt that.
Don't tell me!
It's my stammer!
- Its my field.
I can assure you, no infant starts to speak with a stammer.
When did yours start?
four or five.
That's typical.
So I've been told.
I can't remember not doing it.
I can believe that.
Do you hesitate when you think?
Don't be ridiculous.
How about when you talk to yourself?
Everyone natters occasionally Bertie.
Stop calling me that!
I'm not going to call you anything else.
Then we shan't speak!
Are you charging for this, Doctor?
A fortune.
So, when you talk to yourself, do you stammer?
Of course not!
Well, that proves your impediment isn't a permanent part of you.
What do you think was the cause?
I don't know.
I don't care!
I stammer!
And no one can fix it.
I Bet you, you can read flawlessly, right here, right now.
And if I win, I get to ask questions.
- And if I win?
- You don't have to answer.
One usually ...
wagers money.
A bob each to sweeten it?
Lets See your shilling?
- I don't...
carry money.
- I had a funny feeling you mightn't.
I'll stake you.
You can Pay me back next time.
- Who says there is a next time?
- I haven't agreed to take you on, yet.
Please stand.
and take a look at that...
I can't read this.
Then you owe me a shilling , for not trying.
"To be...
or not to be,....
That...
I can't read!
I haven't finished yet.
I'm going to record your voice and then play it back to you on the same machine.
This is brilliant.
It's the latest thing from America:
its a Silvertone.
Pop this on?
There's a bob in this, mate.
You can go home rich!
- You're playing music.
- I know.
How can I hear what I'm saying?
!
Surely a Prince's brain knows what its mouth is doing?
You're not well acquainted with Royal Princes, are you?
Hopeless.
Hopeless!
You were sublime.
Would I lie to a prince of the realm to win twelve-pence?
I've no idea what an Australian might do for that sort of money.
Let me play it back to you.
No.
All right then, I get to ask you the question.
Thank you Doctor,
I don't feel..
this is for me.
Thank You for your time, Bye.
- Sir?
the recording is free.
Please..
keep it as a souvenir.
KING GEORGE V (O.S.) For the present, the work to which we are all equally bound, is to arrive at a reasoned tranquillity within our borders, to regain prosperity in this time of depression without self-seeking
and to carry with us those whom the burden of past years has disheartened or overborne.
To all, to each,
I wish a Happy Christmas.
God bless you.
Easy when you know how.
Have a go yourself.
Congratulations, Sir.
Ah, Mr Wood.
Splendid fellow.
Chap taught me everything I know:
let the microphone do the work.
Sit up, straight back, face boldly up to the bloody thing and stare it square in the eye, as you would any decent Englishman.
Show who's in command.
Papa, I D-d-don't thu-thu-think I c-c-can read this.
- This devilish device will change everything if you don't.
In the past all a King had to do was look respectable in uniform and not fall off his horse.
Now we must invade people's homes and ingratiate ourselves with them.
This family is reduced to those lowest, basest of all creatures... we've become...actors!
- we're not a family, we're a firm.
- Yet at any moment, some of us may be out of work.
Your darling brother, and future king!
The only wife he appears interested in is invariably the wife of another!
- He's broken off with Lady Furness.
And taken up a Mrs Simpson, a woman with two husbands living!
I told him straight, no divorced person could ever be received at court.
He said, "It made him sublimely happy."
I imagined that was because she was sleeping with him.
"I give you my word..' this is what he said.
"I give you my word we've never had immoral relations,"
Stared square into his father's eyes...
and lied!
When I'm dead that boy will ruin himself, this family, and this nation, within twelve months.
Who'll pick up the pieces?
Herr Hitler, intimidating half of Europe, Marshall Stalin the other half?
Who'll stand between us, the jackboots, and the proletarian abyss?
You?
With your older brother shirking his duties, you're going to have to do a lot more of this.
Have a go yourself.
Son.
Get it out boy!
...m-marvels of m-
- Modern... just take your time - form your words carefully
Science, I am enabled, this ...
- Relax!
Just try it!
Do it!
Lying ..
bastard.
"To be, or not to be, - that is the question: -
"...whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles, And by opposing end them.."
"..to die...
to sleep; no more.."
Strictly business.
No p..
personal nonsense.
I thought I'd made that very clear in our interview.
- Got the shilling you owe me?
- No I haven't!
- Didn't think so.
Besides, you tricked me!
Physical excercises and tricks are important...
What you're asking will only deal with the surface of the problem.
That's sufficient.
As far as i see it, My hausband... has mechanical difficulties with his speech.
Maybe...
Just deal with that.
- I'm willing to work hard, Doctor Logue...
- Lionel.
- Are you..
are you willing to do your part?
Alright.
You want mechanics?
We need to relax your throat muscles and strengthen your tongue.
By repeating tongue twisters for example.
"I am a thistle-sifter.
I have a sieve of sifted thistles and a sieve of unsifted thistles.
Because I am a thistle sifter."
- Fine!
You have a flabby tummy, we must build up the strength in your diaphragm.
Simple mechanics.
That is all we ask.
And that's about a shilling's worth.
Forget about the blessed shilling!
Perhaps, upon occasion, you might be requested some assistance in cope with a minor event.
Will that agreeable?
Of course.
That will be the full extent of your services.
- Shall I see you next week?
- I shall see you every day.
Ahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahah.
Feel the loosening of the jaw
Take a nice deep breath.
Expand your chest..
How do you feel?
full of hot air.
- Isn't that what public speaking is all about?
Are you alright, Bertie?
This is actually quite good fun,
- Hello, Bertie.
- Hello David.
Where've you been?
Been busy.
- So was I.
Elizabeth has pneumonia.
I'm sorry.
She'll recover.
Father won't.
- I'll drive.
Old bugger's doing this on purpose.
Dying?
Departing prematurely...
to complicate matters.
Oh for heaven's sake, David.
You know how long he's been ill.
Wallis explained.
She's terribly clever about this thing.
LORD WIGRAM:
... whereas by letters patent underthe Great Seal, bearing date of Westminster, the eleventh June 1912 his Majesty King George V did constitute, order and declare that there should be a guardian,
Custos Regni, in the form of Councillors of State
It's the order of the Council for the State, Sir.
So we may act on your behalf.
I'm still confused...
Approved.
Thank you.
Feeling a little better Sir?
No.
I'm not feeling any better.
I feel dreadful.
Have you been ice skating?
..Ice skating.
No, George.
...I know, darling, a talk, even a lovely long talk, is a poor substitute for holding tight and making drowsy.
Nor making our own drowsies either, as we've had to dofar too often lately.
David, Dinner?
- I'm on with Wallis!
Wallis misses me terribly.
- Mama says you're late for dinner.
- She forgets Papa's bloody clocks were always half an hour fast!
How is the king?
I hope he is not in pain.
No, no, His Majesty, he's quieter now.
Thank you.
David, If your father were well, tardiness would not be tolerated.
None of this..
unpleasantness would be tolerated
You know Sir, I appreciate that yo are different from your father in your outlook and temperament.
I want you to know that whenever the King questioned your conduct,
I tried in your interest, to present it in a most favourable light.
I can always trust you to have my best interests at heart.
I fear, our vigil will not be of long duration.
Please, continue.
We commend our brother George to the mercy of God, our Maker and Redeemer.
Long live the King.
I hope, I will make good as he has made good.
What on earth was that?
Poor Wallis.
Now I'm trapped!
Time for a Shake, dad?
You sure?
Go on.
Put your thinking caps on.
Bet its the Scottish Play.
No, I bet it's Othello.
It's always Othello.
"Art thou afeard?"
Caliban!
Oh!
For heaven's sake.. that was a lucky guess!
Don't listen to egghead.
Go on, Dad.
"the isle is full ofnoises,Sounds and sweet airs, that give delight, and hurt not.
Sometimes a thousand twanging instruments Will hum about mine ears;
and sometimes voices,That, if then I had waked after long sleep,Will make me sleep again:"
Alright, clever clogs, what comes next?
"..and then, in dreaming, The clouds me thought would open,
and show riches Ready to drop upon me;
that when I'm awake..."
...when I waked, I cried to dream again."
It's such a sad thought.
My next patient must be early.
You better go lads, I'm sorry.
Won't be a moment, Clifford.
Bertie!
they told me not to expect you.
I am Sorry about your father.
I don't wish to intrude..
oh no...
course.
Please come in.
I've been practising.
One hour a day.
In spite of everything.
What's going on there?
I was, sorry, mucking around with my kids.
Do you feel like working today?
A Curtis bi-plane.
I'll put on some hot milk.
Logue, I'd kill for something stronger.
I wasn't there for my father's death.
Still makes me sad.
I can imagine so.
What did you father do?
He was a brewer.
At least there was free beer.
Here's to the memory of your father.
I was informed, after the fact... that my father's last words were:
"Bertie has more guts than the rest of his brothers put together."
He couldn't say that to my face.
My brother.
What about him?
Try singing.
I'm sorry.
Know any songs?
Songs?
Yes songs.
"Swanee River".
I love that song.
Happens to be my favorite.
Sing me the chorus.
No.
Certainly not.
Always wanted to build models.
Father wouldn't allow it.
He collected stamps.
we had to collect stamps.
You can finish that off.
If you sing.
I'm not going to sit here, wobbling.
You can with me.
Because you're peculiar.
I take that as a compliment.
I'm not crooning "Swanee River!"
Try "Camptown Races" then.
"My brother D, he said to me, doo- dah doo-dah..." Continuous sound will give you flow.
Does it feel strange, now that David's on the throne?
To tell the truth,
It was a relief...
Knowing I wouldn't be King.
But unless he produces an heir, you're next in line.
And your daughter, Elizabeth, would then succeed you.
"You're barking up the wrong tree now, Doctor, Doctor."
"Lionel" See?
You didn'stammer.
Of course I didn't stammer, I was singing!
Well, as a little reward, you get to put some glue on these struts.
Your boy, won't mind?
No, not at all.
David and I were very close.
Young bucks...
You know.
Chase the same girls?
David was always very helpful in arranging introductions.
We shared the expert ministrations of "Paulette" in Paris.
Not at the same time of course.
Did David tease you?
Yes, they all did.
"Buh-buh-buh-Bertie".
Father encouraged it. "Get it out, boy!" Said it would make me stop.
Said..."I was afraid of my father, and my children are damn well going to be afraid of me".
Are you naturally right handed?
Left.
I was punished.
Now I use the right.
Yes, that's very common with stammerers.
Anything other corrections?
Knock knees.
Metal splints were made...worn night and day.
That must have been painful.
Bloody agony.
Straight legs now.
Who were you closest to in your family?
Nannies.
Not my first nanny, though..she loved David...hated me.
When we are presented to my parents for the daily viewing, she'd pinch me..
I'd cry and be handed back to her..
immediately.
Then...
she would...
Sing it.
" then she wouldn't feed me, far far away."
Took three years for my parents to notice.
As you can imagine, it caused some stomach problems.
Still.
What about your brother Johnnie?
Were you close to him?
Johnny..
Sweet boy.
Epilepsy...and... he was 'different'.
Died at 13, hidden from view.
I've been told it's not catching.
Do you want a top-up?
Please.
You know, Lionel, you're the first ordinary Englishman...
Australian.
...I've ever really spoken to.
Sometimes, when I ride through the streets and see, you know, the Common Man staring at me,
I'm struck by how little I know of hislife, and how little he knows of mine.
Thank you.
What're friends for.
I wouldn't know.
"I sifted seven thick-stalked thistles through strong thicksieves.
I sifted seven..."
One hundred year old oaks...removed to improve the view!
Who does she think she is!
Nonetheless...we must try to be pleasant towards Mrs Simpson.
You know she calls me "The Fat Scottish Cook"?
You're not fat.
I'm getting plump.
You seldom cook.
I sifted seven.
Shut up!
Their Royal Highnesses the Duke and Duchess of York.
How lovely to see you both.
Welcome to our little country shack.
I came at the invitation of the King.
Hello David.
you're making some changes to the garden, I see yes, I am.
I am not quite finished.
Don't tell me I behaved badly, Mr Churchill.
On the contrary, your Royal Highness.
Etiquette decrees royalty must be greeted by the official host: in this case: the King.
Not a commoner.
- Thank you.
What is her hold on him?
I have no idea.
Apparently she has certain...skills, ...in an establishment in Shanghai.
David, I've been trying to see you...
I've been terribly busy.
Doing what?
Kinging.
Kinging?
is a precarious business!
These days.
Where is the Russian Tsar?
Where is Cousin Wilhelm?
You're being dreary.
Is Kinging laying off eighty staff at Sandringham and buying yet more pearls for Wallis while there ar people marching across Europe singing "The Red Flag"?
Stop your worrying.
Herr Hitler will sort that lot out.
Who'll sort out Herr Hitler?
And you've put that woman into our mother's suite?
Mother's not still in the bed, is she?
That's not funny.
Wally likes the very best.
I don't care what woman you carry on with at night, as long as you show up for duty in the morning!
Wally is not just some woman I am carrying on with.
We intend to marry.
Excuse me?
She's filing a petition for divorce.
Good God.
Can't you just give her a nice house and a title?
I won't have her as my mistress.
David, the Church does not recognise divorce and you are the head of the Church.
Haven't I any rights?
Many privileges...
Not the same thing.
Your beloved Common Man may marry for love, why not me?
If you were the Common Man, on what basis could you possibly claim to be King?
!
Sounds like you've studied our wretched constitution.
Sounds like you haven't.
Is that what this is all about?
Brushing up..
hence the elocution lessons?
I'm trying to t-t...
Yearning for a larger audience are we, B-b-b-bertie?
D-don't ...
Younger brother trying to push older brother off throne..
Pa pa..
...Positively medieval.
Where have you been all this time?
- Never you mind.
Ahh..what a complicated lovely coon you are.
- I try to be.
All that work, down the drain.
My own brother...
I couldn't say..
I couldn't say a word in reply!
Why do you stammer more with David than you do with me?
Because you're bloody well paid to listen!
Bertie, I'm not a geisha girl.
Stop trying to be so bloody clever!
What is it about David that stops you speaking?
What is it about you, that bloody makes want you to go on about it, all the time.
Vulgar but fluent.
You don't stammer when you swear.
Bugger off!
Is that the best you can do?
Well, bloody bugger to you, you beastly bastard.
A public school prig can do better than that.
Shit !
Shit, shit, shit!
shit!
See how defecation flows trippingly from the tongue?
Because I'm angry!
You Know the f-word?
Fornication?
OH Bertie.
Fuck.
Fuck, fuck, fuck!
Yes!
You see!
Not a hesitation!
Bloody, bloody, bloody!
Shit, shit, shit!
Bugger, bugger, bugger!
Fuck, fuck, fuck!
Dad?
What's going on?
Sorry.
Finish your homework
Well ..that's a side of you we don't get to see that often.
No.
No we're not supposed to really, not publicly.
Let's get some air.
No Logue, I don't think that's a good idea.
What's the matter?
What's got you so upset?
Logue, you have no idea.
My brother is infatuated with a woman who's been married twice.
She's asking for a divorce and David is determined to marry her.
Mrs Wallis Simpson of Baltimore.
That's not right.
Queen Wallis of Baltimore?
Unthinkable.
Can he do that?
Absolutely not.
But he's going to anyway.
All hell's broken loose.
- Can't they carry on privately?
- If only they would.
- Where does that leave you?
I know my place!
I'll do anything...
in my power to keep my brother on the throne.
-Is it that serious?
your place may be on the throne.
I am not an alternative to my brother.
If you had to you could outshine David...
Don't take liberties!
That's bordering on treason.
I'm just saying you could be King.
You could do it!
That is treason!
I'm trying to get you to realise you need not be governed by fear.
I've had enough of this!
What're you afraid of?
Your poisonous words!
Why'd you come to me?
You are not some middle class bugger, who needs elocution lessons so you can chit-chat...
Don't instruct me on my duties!
I'm the son of a ....
King... the brother of a king.
You're the disappointing son of a brewer!
A jumped-up jackeroo from the outback!
You're nobody.
These sessions are over!
It's not because she's an American.
That is the least of it.
It's because she is a soon to be a twice divorced American, and the King as head of The Church of England...
can not marry a divorced woman.
And Sir, I apologize for the nature of this, according to Scotland Yard, the King has not always possess exclusive..rights
to Mrs. Simpson's...
favours and affections, sharing them with a married used car salesman, a certain Mr Guy Trundle.
In addition, it is also rumoured...
Hitler's ambassador, Count von Ribbentrop, sends her 17 carnations every day.
Should your brother continue to ignore the advice of His Government, He must abdicate.
Otherwise His Government has no choice but to resign.
Prime Minister, you'd leave the country without a government?
Does the King do what he wants, or does he do what his people expect him to do?
What's the matter, love?
I'm Just having trouble with a patient.
That Isn't like you..
why?
He's scared...
He is afraid with his own shadow.
Isn't that why they come to you?
This fellow could be somebody great, and he's fighting me.
Perhaps, he doesn't want to be great.
Perhaps that's what you want.
I might have overstepped the mark.
Apologize,
Do you both good.
I'm very sorry, Mr Logue, the Duke is busy.
I'm happy to wait.
Or I could come back later.
As I said, the Duke is terribly busy.
Thank you.
The parliament will not support their marriage.
But there were other reasons for concern, Sir.
He was careless with state papers.
He lacked commitment and resolve.
There were those that worried where he would stand when war comes with Germany .
We're not coming to that?
Indeed we are, Sir.
Prime Minister Baldwin may deny this, but Hitler's intent is crystal clear.
War with Germany will come, and we will need a King behind whom we can all stand united.
I fear...my brother is not of sound mind, at this time.
Have you thought what you will call yourself?
Certainly not Albert, Sir.
Too Germanic.
What about George?
After your father?
George the sixth.
It has rather a nice continuity to it, don't you think?
David!
Thank God.
You look exhausted!
How are you bearing up?
Bertie.
The decision's been made.
I have to go.
I cannot accept that.
You are in no condition to make that decision.
I'm afraid there's no other way.
I must marry her.
My mind's made up.
I'm... sorry.
That's a terrible thing to hear.
David, nobody wants that.
I least of all.
" At long last I am able to say, a few words of my own.
I have never wanted to withhold anything, but until now, it has not been constitutionally possible for me to speak.
A few hours ago I discharged my last duty as King and Emperor.
Now that I have been succeeded by my brother, the Duke of York my first words must be to declare my allegiance to him.
This I do with all my heart.
You all know the reasons which have impelled me to renounce the throne.
But you must believe me, when I tell you
I have found it impossible to carry the heavy burden of responsibility and to discharge my duties..
as King as I would wish to do without the help and support of the woman I love...
And I want you to know,
..This decision has been made less difficult to me by the sure knowledge that my brother, with his long training in the public affairs of this country and with his fine qualities will be able to take my place forth with
without interruption or injury to the life and progress of the empire."
I meet you today... in circumstances which are -
Mama, will we have space for our horses in our new home?
Of course we will, darling, we'll have a palace of rooms.
Curtsey.
Your Majesty.
How was it?
I'm trying to familiarise myself with what a state paper looks like.
A despatch from Mr Baldwin which I don't understand a word of.
David's finances.
The Christmas broadcast -
I think that might be a mistake.
Plans for the Coronation -
I think that's an even bigger mistake.
I'm not a King.
I'm a naval officer.
Its the only thing I know.
I'm not a King.
Dear, dear man...
You know...
i refused your first two marriage proposals, not because I didn't love you, but because I couldn't bear the royal cage.
Couldn't bear the idea of a life of tours and public duties, a life that no longer was really to be my own.
But then I thought... he stammers so beautifully... they'll leave us alone.
Waiting for a king to apologize, one can wait rather a long wait.
I'm afraid we're slightly late.
This is home.
Myrtle's at bridge.
I've made sure the boys are out.
It's lovely.
Absolutely lovely.
Would you like some tea, Ma'am?
Yes.
I'll help myself.
Off you go...
Or must I knock your heads together?
Here's your shilling,
I understand... what you were tryingto say, Logue.
I went about it the wrong way.
I'm sorry.
Now here I am.
Is the nation ready for two minutes of radio silence?
Every stammerer always fears they will fall back to square one.
I don't let that happen.
If I fail in my duty...
David could come back.
I've seen the placards
"Save Our King!"
They don't mean me.
Every other monarch in history succeeded someone who was dead, or just about to be.
My predecessor is not only alive, but very much so.
What a bloody mess!
I can't even give them a Christmas Speech.
Like your Dad used to do?
Precisely.
He's not here anymore.
Yes he is.
He's on that shilling I gave you.
Easy enough to give away.
You don't have to carry him around in your pocket.
Or your brother.
You don't need to be afraid of the things as you were afraid of when you were five.
You're very much your own man, Bertie.
Am I?
Your face is next, mate.
Lionel?
Myrtle!
- Is it alright?
- Yes.
Bertie, come here.
- Are you alright, Logue?
- Yes.
- Shall we go through?
- Trust me.
It's important.
What is it?
- Your...
Your...
- It's "Your Majesty", the first time.
After that, it's "Ma'am," as in Ham, not Ma'lm as in Palm.
I haven't told her about us.
Sit down, relax.
I'm told your husband calls my husband Bertie and my husband calls your husband Lionel.
I trust you won't call me Liz.
Your Majesty, you may call me Mrs Logue, Ma'am.
Very nice to meet you, Mrs Logue.
Logue, we can't stand here all day.
Yes we can.
Look, I need to wait for the right moment.
- Logue, you're being a coward!
- You're damn right.
Get out there, man!
Hello, Myrtle darling!
You're early.
I believe you two have met!
But I didn't think, you know...
King George the Sixth.
- It's very nice to meet you.
Will their Majesties be staying to dinner?
We would love to, such a treat, but alas... a previous engagement.
What a pitty.
- Archbishop.
- Welcome, your Majesty.
What a glorious tranformation, Sir.
I hope you'll forgive us if we continue out preparations.
And now you will allow me to guide you through the ceremony.
We begin of course at the West door, then into the nave.
I see you all your pronouncements are to be broadcast, Archbishop.
Ah, yes, wireless is indeed a Pandora's Box.
I'm afraid I also have to permit the newsreel cameras.
The product of which I shall personally edit.
Without momentary hesitation.
This is Doctor Logue of Harley Street.
He's my speech therapist.
- Your Grace.
- Had I known that Your Majesty was seeking assistance
I should've made my own recommendation.
Dr. Logue... will be attending the Coronation.
Well of course I shall speak with the Dean, but it was extremely difficult.
I should like the Doctor to be seated in the King's Box.
But members of your Family will be seated there, Sir.
That is why it's suitable.
And now, if you don't mind Your Grace, we need the premises.
My dear fellow, this is Westminster Abbey!
The Church must prepare his Majesty.
My preparations are equalized in important
With complete privacy, if you don't mind.
Those are my wishes, Your Grace.
I shall place the Abbey at Your Majesty's disposal... this evening.
Your Majesty.
.
.
I can't believe I'm walking on Chaucer and Handel and Dickens.
Everything alright?
Let's get cracking.
I'm not here to rehearse, Doctor Logue.
Call me Lionel.
True, you... never...
called yourself "Doctor."
I did that... for you.
No training, no... diploma, no... qualifications.
Just a... great deal of nerve.
The star chamber inquisition, is this?
You asked trust and... total equality.
Bertie, I heard you at Wembley.
I was there.
My son Laurie said "Dad, do you think you could help that poor man?"
What, as a failed actor!
?
It's true, I'm not a doctor, and yes I acted a bit,
Well I recited in pubs and taught elocution in schools.
When the Great War came, all our Soldiers were returning straight from the front, a lot of them shell-shocked, unable to speak
somebody said, "Lionel, you're very good at all this speech stuff.
Do you thin you can possibly help these poor buggers."
I did muscle therapy, exercise, relaxation, but I knew I had to go deeper.
These poor young blokes had cried out in fear, no-one was listening to them.
My job was to give them faith in their own voice and let them know that a friend was listening.
That must ring a few bells with you, Bertie.
You give a very noble account of yourself.
Make inquiries.
It's all true.
Inquiries have been made!
You have no idea who I have breathing down my neck?
I vouched for you and you have no...
credentials.
But lots of success!
I can't show you certificate - there was no training then.
Everything I know I know from experience, and that war... was some experience.
My plaque says, "L. Logue, Speech Defects."
No Dr., there are no letters after my name.
Lock me in the Tower.
- I would if I could!
- On what charge?
- Fraud!
With war looming, you've saddled this nation with a voiceless King.
You destroyed the happiness of my family.
All for the sake of ensnaring a star... patient you couldn't possibly hope to assist!
It'll be like mad...
King George the Third, there'll be mad King George the stammerer, who let his people down so badly in their hour of need!
What're you doing?
Get up!
You can't sit there!
Get up!
Why not?
It's a chair.
No, that's not a chair, that is... that is...
That is Saint Edward's Chair!
- People have carved their names on it.
That chair is the seat on which every King and Queen---
- It's held in a place by a large rock!
- That's the Stone of Scone, you are trivialising everything.
- You believe such bollocks.
- You're trivialising everything!
- I don't care how many royal...
- Listen to me.
Listen to me!
- ...arse have sat in this chair.
- Listen to me... !
- Listen to you?
!
By what right?
By the divine right, if you must!
I'm your King!
No you're not!
You told me so yourself.
You said you didn't want it.
Why should I waste my time listening to you?
- Because I have a right to be heard!
- Heard as what?
!
- I HAVE A VOICE!
Yes you do.
You have such a perservance, Bertie, you're the bravest man I know.
And you'll make a bloody good king.
- What on earth's going on, Sir?
- It's quite alright, Archbishop.
Mr Logue, you must know that I found a replacement English specialist with impeccable credentials.
Hence, your services will no longer be required.
- I'm sorry?
- Your Majesty's function is to consult and be advised.
And you didn't consuly, but you've just been advised.
Now I advise you: in this personal matter I will make my own decision.
My concern is for the head upon which I must place the crown.
I appreciate that Archbshop, but it's my head!
Your humble servant.
Thank you Bertie.
Shall we rehearse?
Come on up on your purge.
Now when you and Elizabeth enter through the West door, you'll be greeted by the hymn "I Was Glad When They Said Unto Me."
Actually you won't be that glad, because they sing it for a very long time.
Then your friend the Archbishop will ponce up the stairs toward you and say "Sir, is Your Majesty willing to take The Oath?"
- "I am willing".
- Course you are!
I'm gonna see what it sounds like in the cheap seats so even your old nanny can hear.
"Will you govern your peoples of Great Britain, Ireland, Canada,
Australia and New Zealand according to their lands and customs?"
- "I solemnly promise so do so."
- LOUDER!
I can't hear you up the back.
"I SOLEMNLY PROMISE TO DO SO!"
Very good!
"Will you to your power cause Law and Justice, in Mercy, to be executed in all your judgements?"
"I will." "I WILL!"
Then there's a very long bit about upholding the faith, goes on, rubbish, rubbish, rubbish.
To which you finally say...
"The things which I have herebefore promised, I will perform and keep.
So help me God."
And that's all you'll say.
Four short responses, kiss the book and sign the oath and you're King.
Easy.
You nearly crowned him backwards Archbishop!
Someone had removed the thread marking the back of the Crown, Sir.
Try not lose the thread, Archbishop.
Archbishop, we're missing Papa.
Very good, very good.
Archbishop.
Well, I hope Your Majesties are thrilled with the result.
You could switch that machine off now.
No, wait, keep going.
Do have a seat, Archbishop.

- Papa?
- Mmm?
- Papa, what's he saying?
I don't know, but he seems to be saying it rather well.
Sir, I have asked to see you today in order to tender my resignation as Prime Minister.
I am so sorry to hear that, Mr Baldwin.
Neville Chamberlain will take my place as Prime Minister.
It's a matter of principal.
I was mistaken.
I have found it impossible to believe that there is any man in the World so lacking in moral feeling as Hitler,
but the world might be hurled for a second time into the abyss of destructive War.
Churchill was right all along.
This was always Hitler's intention.
I am many very sorry to leave you in this great time of crisis.
I am very much afraid Sir, that your greatest test is yet to come.
I am speaking to you from the cabinet room at 10 Downing Street.
This morning the British Ambassador in Berlin handed the German Government a final note
stating that unless we heard from them by 11 o'clock that they were prepared at once to withdraw their troops from Poland, a state of war would exist between us.
I have to tell you now that no such undertaking has been received, and that consequently this country is at war with Germany.
At last Sir, here is your speech.
You are on air at six.
I've timed it at just under nine minutes.
The wording is fully approved.
The Prime Minister will be joining you for the broadcast which will go out live across the Nation, the Empire and to our Armed Forces.
Get Logue here immediately.
- There's the barrage balloons.
- Yes.
They got them up there quickly.
Yeah.
.
.
.
- Should we pull over and find shelter?
- No, go straight on.
We'll be alright
.
- Yes.
Sir?
- Lionel Logue.
Major Hartley's expecting me.
This is my son Laury.
- Thank you, Laurie.
- Good luck, Dad.
- The King's Speech.
- Thank you, Sir.
We have about forty minutes until the broadcast.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
"There may be dark days ahead, and..."
Try again.
"There may be dark days ahead, and..."
Turn the hesitations into pauses, and say to yourself, "God save the King".
I say that continuously, but apparently no one's listening.
Long pauses are good: they add solemnity to great occasions.
Then I'm the solemnest king who ever lived.
And Lionel, if I am to be King...
where is my power?
Can I...
Can I form a Government?
Can I...
Can I levy a tax or declare a war?
No!
Yet I am the seat of all authority.
Why?
Because the Nation believes that when I speak, I speak for them.
Yet I cannot speak!
Let's take it all again from the top.
"In this grave hour..."
"In this grave hour fuck fuck fuck perhaps the most fateful in our history bugger shit shit
I send to every household of my...
You see "P" is always difficult, even when I'm singing.
Bounce onto it "a-peoples", not "people".
"a-people household of me..." "a-peoples both at home and overseas..."
Beaut.
...this message, doo-dah, spoken with the same depth of feeling, doo-dah-dey, ...for each one of you as if I were able to shit fuck bugger cross your threshold and speak to you"
In your head, now: "I have a right to be bloody well heard!"
Bloody well heard, bloody well heard, bloody well heard myself!
Now Waltz.
Move!
Get continuous movement.
"For the second time in the lives of most of us we are at..."
- "we are..." Take a pause.
- Lionel, I can't do this.
Bertie, you can do it.
- Have a look at the last paragraph.
- Bertie, it's time.
There he is.
- Archbishop.
- Your Majesty.
A great moment, Sir.
- Prime Minister.
- Your Majesty.
Nice to see you again, so soon.
Good of you to be here, I'm sure you've had rather a busy day.
Let's hope we have no more interruptions from those damned sirens, Sir.
Or the wretched dogs.
- Congratulations.
First Lord of the Admiralty.
- Your Majesty.
The long walk.
Good luck, Sir.
I too dread this apparatus.
Had a speech impediment myself, you know.
- I didn't.
- Family secret.
Tongue-tied.
An operation was considered to be too dangerous.
I eventually made an asset of it.
- Thank you, Mr Churchill.
- Good, Sir.
Darling.
- How long, Logue?
- Just under three minutes, Sir.
.
Five seconds, Sir.
5, 4, 3 , 2 , 1.
.
.
- Mr Wood.
- Good luck, Your Majesty.
Mr Wood.
- You'll be decorated, Logue.
- I made it cosy.
Some fresh air.
There you are, Darling.
I'm thistle sifter, I've a sieve of sifted thistles and a sieve on unsifted thistles.
I've a sieve of sifted thistles and a sieve on unsifted thistles, because I'm...
Bertie, darling, make sure it's not switched on!
Remember the red light will blink four times and then I've asked them to turn it off, because we don't want that evil eye staring at you all the way through.
One minute, sir.
I am sure you will be splendid.
Fourty seconds, Sir.
Logue, however this turns out,
I don't know how to thank you for what you've done.
Knighthood?
Twenty seconds.
Forget everything else and just say it to me.
Say it to me, as a friend.
In this grave hour,
perhaps the most fateful in our history,
I send to every household of my peoples,
both at home
and overseas
this message spoken with the same depth of feeling
for each one of you as if I were able to cross your threshold
and speak to you myself.
For the second time in the lives of most of us we are at... at war.
Over and over again we have tried to find
a peaceful way out of the differences between ourselves and those who are now our enemies.
But it has been in vain.
We have been forced into a conflict.
For we are called, to meet the challenge of a principle which, if it were to prevail, would be fatal to any civilized order
in the world.
Such a principle, stripped of all disguise,
is surely the mere
primitive doctrine that might is right.
For the sake of all that we ourselves hold dear, it is unthinkable that we should refuse to meet the challenge.
It is to this high purpose that I now call my people at home and my peoples across the seas, who will make our cause their own.
I ask them to stand calm and firm, and united in this time of trial
the task will be hard.
There may be dark days ahead, and war can no longer be confined to the battlefield.
But we can only do the right as we see the right and reverently commit our cause to God.
If one and all we keep resolutely faithful to it, then, with God's help,
we shall prevail.
Very good, Bertie.
You still stammered on the "w".
Had to throw in a few so they knew it was me.
Congratulations, your Majesty.
A true broadcaster.
Thank you, Mr Wood.
Congratulations, your Majesty.
- Congratulations, your Majesty.
- Thank you.
Ready.
- Good?
- Perfect.
Your first war time speech.
Congratulations.
Expect I shall have to do a great deal more.
Thank you, Logue.
Well done, my friend.
Thank you, Your Majesty.
I knew you'd be good.
Thank you, Lionel.
Onwards?
Congratulations, Sir.
Almost did it better then myself, Sir.
Your Majesty, I'm speechless.
Congratulations, Sir.
Gentlemen.
Congratulations, your Majesty.
So how was Papa, Elizabeth?
Halting at first, but you got much better Papa.
Bless you.
- And how about you, Margaret?
- You were just splendid, Papa.
Of course I was.
We all ready?
Come on girls.
1925 King George V reigns over a quarter of the world's population.
He asks his second son, the Duke of York, to give the closing speech at the Empire Exhibition in Wembley, London.
You are live in two minutes, Your Royal Highness.
Sir?
At the microphone, Do your work Sir.
I am sure you will be splendid.
Just take your time.
Time to go.
BBC NEWS READER:
Good afternoon.
This is the BBC National Programme and Empire Services taking you to Wembley Stadium for the Closing Ceremony of the Empire Exhibition.
where His Royal Highness the Duke of York will read a message from His Father;
His Majesty, King George V.
58 British Colonies and Dominions have taken part, making this the largest Exhibition staged anywhere in the world.
Remember Sir, Three flashes;
then steady 'red' means you are Live.
Using the new invention of radio,
The Opening Ceremony was the first time his Majesty the King addressed his subjects on the wireless.
At the close of the first Season,
The heir to the throne His R. Highness the Prince of Wales, made his 1st broadcast
And today, his younger brother His Royal Highness, the Duke of York will give his inaugural broadcast to the Nation and the W.
I have received... from his Majesty... t' ek
...The King.
Inhale deep into your lungs..
Your Royal Highness.
Relaxes your larynx, does it not?
Cigarette smoking calms the nerves and gives you confidence.
If Your Highness will be very kind as to open your hand...
It's Sterilized.
Now..
Now... if I may take the liberty?
...insert some into your mouth.
Excuse me, Doctor.
What is the purpose of this?
The classic approach, it cured Demosthenes.
That was in Ancient Greece... uh
Has it worked since?
Now, if you would be so kind as to read...
A wealth of words.
Fight against those marbles, Your Royal Highness.
Enunciate!
A little more concentration your Royal Highness.
I nearly swallowed the bloody things!
Thank you so much, Doctor, it's been most... hmm interesting.
Insert marbles!
He can insert his own bloody marbles...!
Tick, tock, tick, tock.
You know, you can't keep doing this, Bertie.
I know.
Promise me:
no more.
Hello.
Is anyone there?
I'm just in the loo.
Ah, Mrs. Johnson There you are.
I'm sorry, there's no receptionist.
I like to keep things simple.
Poor and content is rich and rich enough.
- Sorry?
- Shakespeare.
How are you?
How do you do?
Coughing a lot.
Now, this is slightly awkward, But..
I'm afraid you're late.
Yes, I'm afraid I am.
Where's Mr. Johnson?
He doesn't know I'm here.
That's not a promising start.
My husband has seen everyone to no avail.
Awfully 'fraid he's given up hope.
He hasn't seen me.
You're awfully sure of yourself.
Well, I'm sure of anyone who wants to be cured.
Of course, he wishes to be cured.
My husband is umm..
he's required to speak publicly.
Perhaps he should change jobs?
- He can't.
Indentured servitude?
Something of that nature.
Well we need to have your hubby pop by...
Uh..
Tuesday would be good...
He can give me his personal details and I'll make a frank appraisal and then, we can take it from there.
I do not have a hubby...
We don't 'pop' and nor do we ever talk about our private lives.
You...
must come to us.
I'm Sorry, Mrs. Johnson, my game, my turf, my rules.
You'll have to talk over this with your husband and then you can speak to me on the telephone
Thank you very much for dropping by.
Good afternoon.
And what if my husband were the Duke of York?
The Duke of York?
Yes...
the Duke of York.
I thought the appointment was for Johnson?
Forgive me, your...?
- ...
Royal Highness.
Johnson was used during the Great War;
when the Navy didn't want the enemy to know 'he' was aboard.
- Am I... considered the enemy?
You will be, if you remain un- obliging.
Of course.
How did you find me, Your Royal Highness?
The President of the Speech Therapists Society.
Eileen McLeod?
She's a sport.
She warned me your antipodean methods were unorthodox and controversial.
I warned her...
those were not my favorite words.
I can cure your husband.
But for my method to work I need trust and total equality.
Here, in the safety of my consultation room.
No exceptions.
Well then, in that case...
When can you start?
Still sounds a bit rough, mate.
You make me drive too slowly, Dad!
Did you pick mum up from Bridge?
Yes, I've hardly been out of the car all day
I had a special visitor this afternoon.
- May I please leave this table
- How special, special?
No, You must stay, bored stupid, listening to your parents' inane conversation.
- Thanks Dad..
- and Mum.
- Me too.
- You meeting Jean?
- No, someone else.
Doctor?
Doctor?
Can't you help your brother with the washing...
I'm fine.
Who's it Lionel?
Why bring it up if you can't talk about it?
Myrtle, It's just a woman, looking to help her husband.
Oh!
And I had a 'call'.
for an audition.
One of my favorites.
- Aren't they all?
It Could be a lot of fun.
I'm sure you'll be splendid.
They're a highly regarded group.
From Putney.
Tomorrow, Chapter IV.
'The Flight'.
Oh, to fly away!
Weren't they lucky!
Now Papa tell a story!
- Could I be a penguin instead?
Once, there were two princesses...
Princess Elizabeth and Princess Margaret.
whose Papa was a penguin.
This was because he had been turned into one by the wicket witch.
This was an inconvenient for him because he loved... to hold his princesses in his arms... but you can't because he don't have wings like herrings
- Herrings don't have wings.
- Penguins have wings which is shaped like herrings and make matters worse... is that she sent him to the South Pole.
which is an awfully long walk.. back.
if you can't fly.
So..
When he reached the water, he dived in through the dept so fast... that he was in Southampton waters by lunchtime.
And from there, he took the 2.30 to Weybridge, changed at Clapham Junction and asked a passing Mallard the way to Buckingham P.
He swam up the Thames, out through the plughole, and gave the cook,
Mama and...
Mrs. Whittaker quite a shock.
Now when the girls heard all the commotions, they ran to the kitchen where they gave him a good scrub, a mackerel and a kiss.
and as they kissed him, guess what he turned into?
- A handsome prince.
A short-tailed Albatross.
With wings so big that he could wrap them both his two girls together.
Now, now..
It's time for bed.
Will Mrs. Simpson be there?
- My brother's insisting.
- Is he serious?
- About her coming to dinner?
- No.
About her!
- A married woman?
He can't be.
- She can.
By the way,
I think I found someone rather interesting.
On Harley Street.
A doctor.
- Out of the question.
I'm not having this conversation again.
The matter's settled.
- His approach seems rather different...
Now?
Now.
Now is the winter of our discontent,
Made glorious summer by this sun of York".
And all the clouds that lured upon our house
In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.
Now are our brows, bound with victorious... wreaths;
- Thank you!
Lovely diction Mr...?
- Logue.
Lionel Logue.
- Well, Mr. Logue.
I'm not hearing the cries of a deformed creature yearning to be King.
Nor did I realize Richard the Third was King of the Colonies.
I do know the lines.
I've played the role before.
- Sydney?
- Perth.
- Major theater town, is it?
- Enthusiastic.
- Ah.
- I was well reviewed.
Yes...
well...
Lionel,
I think our dramatic society, is looking for someone slightly younger and a... little more regal.
Where did you find this... physician?
Classifieds, next to French model, Shepherd's Market..
He comes highly recommended.
Charges substantial fees in order to help the poor.
Oh dear, perhaps he's a Bolshevik?
!
No receptionist.
He likes to keep things simple.
- The Johnsons.
You can go in now, Mr. Johnson..
Lionel says... wait here if you wish, Mrs. Johnson.
Or, it being a p- pleasant day, p- perhaps take a stroll.
Was that alright...
Lionel?
Marvellous!
Willy.
You can stay and wait for your mom.
Mrs. Johnson...
Mr. Johnson, Do come in.
He's a good lad, Willy.
He could hardly make a sound, you know, when he first came to me.
My boys made those.
Good, aren't they?
Please make yourself comfortable.
I was told not to sit too close.
Well I believe when speaking with a Prince,
One waits for the prince to choose a topic.
Waiting for me to...
commence a conversation..
one can wait a rather long wait.
Do you Know any jokes?
Timing isn't my strong suit.
Cuppa tea?
No thank you.
Aren't you going to start treating me Dr. Logue?
Only if you're interested in being treated.
Please, call me Lionel.
I prefer Doctor.
I prefer Lionel.
What'll I call you?
Your Royal Highness, then Sir after that.
A bit formal for here.
I prefer names.
Prince Albert...
Frederick Arthur George.
How about Bertie?
Only my family uses that.
Perfect.
In here, it's better if we're equals.
If we were equal I wouldn't be here.
I'd be at home with my wife and no-one would give a damn.
Please, Don't do that.
I'm sorry?
I believe, Sucking smoke into your lungs will kill you.
My physicians say it relaxes the throat.
They're idiots.
They've all been knighted.
Makes it official then.
My 'castle', my rules.
What was your earliest memory?
What?
an earth do you mean?
Your First recollection.
I'm not... here to discuss my personal matters.
Why're you here then?
Because I bloody well stammer!
You have a bit of a temper?
One of my many faults.
When did the defect start?
I've always been this way!
I doubt that.
Don't tell me!
It's my stammer!
- It's my field.
I can assure you, no infant starts to speak with a stammer.
When did yours start?
four or five.
That's typical.
So I've been told.
I can't remember not doing it.
I can believe that.
Do you hesitate when you think?
Don't be ridiculous.
How about when you talk to yourself?
Everyone natters occasionally Bertie.
Stop calling me that!
I'm not going to call you anything else.
Then we shan't speak!
Are you charging for this, Doctor?
A fortune.
So, when you talk to yourself, do you stammer?
Of course not!
Well, that proves your impediment isn't a permanent part of you.
What do you think was the cause?
I don't know.
I don't care!
I stammer!
And no one can fix it.
I Bet you, you can read flawlessly, right here, right now.
And if I win, I get to ask questions.
- And if I win?
- You don't have to answer.
One usually...
wagers money.
A bob each to sweeten it?
Let's See your shilling?
- I don't...
carry money.
- I had a funny feeling you mightn't.
I'll stake you.
You can Pay me back next time.
- Who says there is a next time?
- I haven't agreed to take you on, yet.
Please stand.
and take a look at that...
I can't read this.
Then you owe me a shilling, for not trying.
To be...
or not to be,...
That...
I can't read!
I haven't finished yet.
I'm going to record your voice and then play it back to you on the same machine.
This is brilliant.
It's the latest thing from America:
it's a Silverstone.
Pop this on?
There's a bob in this, mate.
You can go home rich!
- You're playing music.
- I know.
How can I hear what I'm saying?
!
Surely a Prince's brain knows what its mouth is doing?
You're not well acquainted with Royal Princes, are you?
Hopeless.
Hopeless!
You were sublime.
Would I lie to a prince of the realm to win twelve-pence?
I've no idea what an Australian might do for that sort of money.
Let me play it back to you.
No.
All right then, I get to ask you the question.
Thank you Doctor,
I don't feel..
this is for me.
Thank You for your time, Bye.
- Sir?
the recording is free.
Please keep it as a souvenir.
For the present, the work to which we are all equally bound, is to arrive at a reasoned tranquillity within our borders, to regain prosperity in this time of depression without self-seeking and to carry with us those whom the burden of past years has disheartened
or ever borne.
To all, to each,
I wish a Happy Christmas.
God bless you.
Easy when you know how.
Have a go yourself.
Congratulations, Sir.
Ah, Mr. Wood.
Splendid fellow.
Chap taught me everything I know:
let the microphone do the work.
Sit up, straight back, face boldly up to the bloody thing and stare it square in the eye, as you would any decent Englishman.
Show who's in command.
Papa, I D-d-don't thu-thu-think I c-c-can read this.
- This devilish device will change everything if you don't.
In the past all a King had to do was look respectable in uniform and not fall off his horse.
Now we must invade people's homes and ingratiate ourselves with them.
This family is reduced to those lowest, basest of all creatures... we've become... actors!
- we're not a family, we're a firm.
- Yet at any moment, some of us may be out of work.
Your darling brother, and future king!
The only wife he appears interested in is invariably the wife of another!
- He's broken off with Lady Furness.
And taken up a Mrs. Simpson, a woman with two husbands living!
I told him straight, no divorced person could ever be received at court.
He said, "It made him sublimely happy. "
I imagined that was because she was sleeping with him.
'I give you my word', this is what he said.
I give you my word we've never had immoral relations.
Stared square into his father's eyes...
and lied!
When I'm dead that boy will ruin himself, this family and this nation within 12 months.
Who'll pick up the pieces?
Herr Hitler, intimidating half of Europe, Marshall Stalin the other half?
Who'll stand between us, the jackboots, and the proletarian abyss?
You?
With your older brother shirking his duties, you're going to have to do a lot more of this
Have a go yourself.
Son.
Get it out boy!
...m-marvels of m-
- Modern... just take your time - form your words carefully
Science, I am enabled...
- Relax!
Just try it!
Do it!
Lying..
bastard.
To be, or not to be?
That is the question.
Whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles, and by opposing end them.
"To die.
To sleep no more.. "
Strictly business.
No p..
personal nonsense.
I thought I'd made that very clear in our interview.
- Got the shilling you owe me?
- No I haven't!
- Didn't think so.
Besides, you tricked me!
Physical exercises and tricks are important
What you're asking will only deal with the surface of the problem.
That's sufficient.
As far as i see it, My husband... has mechanical difficulties with his speech.
Maybe...
Just deal with that.
- I'm willing to work hard, Doctor Logue...
- Lionel.
- Are you..
are you willing to do your part?
Alright.
You want mechanics?
We need to relax your throat muscles and strengthen your tongue.
By repeating tongue twisters for example.
I am a thistle-sifter.
I have a sieve of sifted thistles and a sieve of unsifted thistles.
Because I am a thistle sifter.
- Fine!
You do have a flabby tummy, we must build up the strength in your diaphragm.
Simple mechanics.
That is all we ask.
And that's about a shilling's worth.
Forget about the blessed shilling!
Perhaps, upon occasion, you might be requested to assist...
in cope with some minor event.
Will that agreeable?
Of course.
That will be the full extent of your services.
- Shall I see you next week?
- I shall see you every day.
Ahahahahhaha...
Feel the loosening of the jaw
Take a nice deep breath.
Expand your chest..
How do you feel?
full of hot air.
- Isn't that what public speaking is all about?
Are you alright, Bertie?
This is actually quite good fun,
- Hello, Bertie.
- Hello David.
Where've you been?
Been busy.
- So was I.
Elizabeth has pneumonia.
I'm sorry.
She'll recover.
Father won't.
- I'll drive.
Old bugger's doing this on purpose.
Dying?
Departing prematurely...
to complicate matters.
Oh for heaven's sake, David.
You know how long he's been ill.
Wallis explained.
She's terribly clever about this thing.
Whereas by letters patent under the Great Seal, bearing date of Westminster, the 11th June 1912
His Majesty King George V did constitute, order and declare that there should be a guardian,
Custos Regni, in the form of Councilors of State
It's the order of the Council for the State, Sir.
So we may act on your behalf.
I'm still confused...
Approved.
Thank you.
Feeling a little better Sir?
No.
I'm not feeling any better.
I feel dreadful.
Have you been ice skating?
.. Ice skating.
No, George.
...I know, darling, a talk, even a lovely long talk, is a poor substitute for holding tight and making drowsy.
Nor making our own drowsiest either, as we've had to do far too often lately.
David, Dinner?
- I'm on with Wallis!
Wallis misses me terribly.
- Mama says you're late for dinner.
- She forgets Papa's bloody clocks were always half an hour fast!
How is the king?
I hope he is not in pain.
No, no, His Majesty, he's quieter now.
Thank you.
David, If your father were well, tardiness would not be tolerated.
None of this unpleasantness would be tolerated
You know Sir, I appreciate that you are different from your father... both in outlook and temperament.
I want you to know that whenever the King questioned your conduct,
I tried in your interest, to present it in a most favourable light.
I can always trust you to have my best interests at heart.
I fear, our vigil will not be of long duration.
Please, continue.
We commend our brother George to the mercy of God, our Maker and Redeemer.
Long live the King.
I hope, I will make good as he has made good.
What on earth was that?
Poor Wallis.
Now I'm trapped!
Time for a Shake, dad?
You sure?
Go on.
Put your thinking caps on.
Bet it's the Scottish Play.
No, I bet it's Othello.
It's always Othello.
Art thou afeard?
Caliban!
Oh!
For heaven's sake.. that was a lucky guess!
Don't listen to egghead.
Go on, Dad.
the isle is full of noises, sounds and sweet airs, that give delight and hurt not.
Sometimes a thousand twanging instruments will hum about mine ears;
and sometimes voices, that if then I had waked after long sleep will make me sleep again
Alright, clever clogs, what comes next?
.. and then, in dreaming, The clouds me thought would open, and show riches ready to drop upon me, that when I'm awake when I waked, I cried to dream again.
It's such a sad thought.
My next patient must be early.
You better go lads, I'm sorry.
Won't be a moment, Clifford.
Bertie!
they told me not to expect you.
I am Sorry about your father.
I don't wish to intrude..
oh no...
course.
Please come in.
I've been practicing.
One hour a day.
In spite of everything.
What's going on there?
I was, sorry, mucking around with my kids.
Do you feel like working today?
A Curtis bi-plane.
I'll put on some hot milk.
Logue, I'd kill for something stronger.
I wasn't there for my father's death.
Still makes me sad.
I can imagine so.
What did you father do?
He was a brewer.
At least there was free beer.
Here's to the memory of your father.
I was informed, after the fact... that my father's last words were:
Bertie has more guts than the rest of his brothers put together.
He couldn't say that to my face.
My brother.
What about him?
Try singing.
I'm sorry.
Know any songs?
Songs?
Yes songs.
Swanee River
I love that song.
Happens to be my favorite.
Sing me the chorus.
No.
Certainly not.
Always wanted to build models.
Father wouldn't allow it.
He collected stamps.
we had to collect stamps.
You can finish that off.
If you sing.
I'm not going to sit here, wobbling.
You can with me.
Because you're peculiar.
I take that as a compliment.
I'm not crooning Swanee River!
Try Campton Races then.
My brother D, had said to me, doo-dah...
Continuous sound will give you flow.
Does it feel strange, now that David's on the throne?
To tell the truth,
It was a relief...
Knowing I wouldn't be King.
But unless he produces an heir, you're next in line.
And your daughter, Elizabeth, would then succeed you.
You're barking up the wrong tree now, Doctor, Doctor.
Lionel.
See?
You didn't stammer.
Of course I didn't stammer, I was singing!
Well, as a little reward, you get to put some glue on these struts.
Your boy, won't mind?
No, not at all.
David and I were... very close.
Young bucks...
You know.
Chase the same girls?
David was always very helpful in arranging introductions.
We shared the expert ministrations of Paulette in Paris.
Not at the same time of course.
Did David tease you?
Yes, they all did.
Buh-buh-buh-Bertie..
Father encouraged it. "Get it out, boy!
Said it would make me stop.
I was afraid of my father, and my children are damn well going to be afraid of me.
Are you naturally right handed?
Left.
I was punished.
Now I use the right.
Yes, that's very common with stammerers.
Anything other corrections?
Knock knees.
Metal splints were made... worn night and day.
That must have been painful.
Bloody agony.
Straight legs now.
Who were you closest to in your family?
Nannies.
Not my first nanny, though.. she loved David... hated me.
When we are presented to my parents for the daily viewing, she'd pinch me..
I'd cry and be handed back to her..
immediately.
Then...
she would...
Sing it.
...Then she wouldn't feed me, far far away.
Took three years for my parents to notice.
As you can imagine, it caused some stomach problems.
Still.
What about your brother Johnnie?
Were you close to him?
Johnny..
Sweet boy.
Epilepsy... and... he was 'different'.
Died at 13, hidden from view.
I've been told it's not catching.
Do you want a top-up?
Please.
You know, Lionel, you're the first ordinary Englishman...
Australian.
...I've ever really spoken to.
Sometimes, when I ride through the streets and see, you know, the Common Man staring at me,
I'm struck by how little I know of his life, and how little he knows of mine.
Thank you.
What're friends for.
I wouldn't know.
I sifted seven thick-stalked thistles through strong thick sieves.
I sifted seven
One hundred year old oaks... removed to improve the view!
Who does she think she is!
Nonetheless... we must try to be pleasant towards Mrs. Simpson.
You know she calls me The Fat Scottish Cook?
You're not fat.
I'm getting plump.
You seldom cook.
I sifted seven.
Shut up!
Their Royal Highnesses the Duke and Duchess of York.
How lovely to see you both.
Welcome to our little country shack.
I came at the invitation of the King.
Hello David.
you're making some changes to the garden, I see yes, I am.
I am not quite finished.
Don't tell me I behaved badly, Mr. Churchill.
On the contrary, your R. Highness.
Etiquette decrees royalty must be greeted by the official host: in this case, the King.
Not a commoner.
- Thank you.
What is her hold on him?
I have no idea.
Apparently she has certain... skills, ...in an establishment in Shanghai.
David, I've been trying to see you...
I've been terribly busy.
Doing what?
Kinging.
Kinging?
is a precarious business!
These days.
Where is the Russian Tsar?
Where is Cousin Wilhelm?
You're being dreary.
Is Kinging laying off eighty staff and buying yet more pearls for Wallis while there are people marching across Europe singing The Red Flag.
Stop your worrying.
Herr Hitler will sort that lot out.
Who'll sort out Herr Hitler?
And you've put that woman into our mother's suite?
Mother's not still in the bed, is she?
That's not funny.
Wally likes the very best.
I don't care what woman you carry on with at night, as long as you show up for duty in the morning!
Wally is not just some woman I am carrying on with.
We intend to marry.
Excuse me?
She's filing a petition for divorce.
Good God.
Can't you just give her a nice house and a title?
I won't have her as my mistress.
David, the Church does not recognise divorce and you are the head of the Church.
Haven't I any rights?
Many privileges...
Not the same thing.
Your beloved Common Man may marry for love, why not me?
If you were the Common Man, on what basis could you possibly claim to be King?
!
Sounds like you've studied our wretched constitution.
Sounds like you haven't.
Is that what this is all about?
Brushing up... hence the elocution lessons?
I'm trying to t-t...
Yearning for a larger audience are we, B- b-b-bertie?
D- don't...
Younger brother trying to push older brother off throne..
Pa pa..
... Positively medieval.
Where have you been all this time?
- Never you mind.
Ahh.. what a complicated lovely coon you are.
- I try to be.
All that work, down the drain.
My own brother...
I couldn't say..
I couldn't say a word in reply!
Why do you stammer more with David than you do with me?
Because you're bloody well paid to listen!
Bertie, I'm not a geisha girl.
Stop trying to be so bloody clever!
What is it about David that stops you speaking?
What is it about you, that bloody makes want you to go on about it, all the time.
Vulgar but fluent.
You don't stammer when you swear.
Bugger off!
Is that the best you can do?
Well, bloody bugger to you, you beastly bastard.
A public school prig can do better than that.
Shit!
Shit, shit, shit!
shit!
See how defecation flows trippingly from the tongue?
Because I'm angry!
You Know the f-word?
Fornication?
OH Bertie.
Fuck.
Fuck, fuck, fuck!
Yes!
You see!
Not a hesitation!
Shit, shit, shit!
Bugger, bugger, bugger!
Fuck, fuck, fuck!
Dad?
What's going on?
Sorry.
Finish your homework
Well.. that's a side of you we don't get to see that often.
No.
No we're not supposed to really, not publicly.
Let's get some air.
No Logue, I don't think that's a good idea.
What's the matter?
What's got you so upset?
Logue, you have no idea.
My brother is infatuated with a woman who's been married twice.
She's asking for a divorce and David is determined to marry her.
Mrs. Wallis Simpson of Baltimore.
That's not right.
Queen Wallis of Baltimore?
Unthinkable.
Can he do it?
Absolutely not.
But he's going to anyway.
All hell's broken loose.
Can't they carry on privately?
If only they would.
Where does that leave you?
I know my place!
I will do anything... in my power to keep my brother on the throne.
Is it that serious?
your place may be on the throne.
I am not an alternative to my brother.
If you had to you could outshine David...
Don't take liberties!
That's bordering on treason.
I'm just saying you could be King.
You could do it!
That is treason!
I'm trying to get you to realise you need not be governed by fear.
I've had enough of this!
What're you afraid of?
Your poisonous words!
Why'd you come to me?
You are not some middle class bugger, who needs elocution lessons so you can chit-chat...
Don't instruct me on my duties!
I'm the son of a...
King, the brother of a king.
You're the disappointing son of a brewer!
A jumped-up jackeroo from the outback!
You're nobody.
These sessions are over!
It's not because she's an American.
That is the least of it.
It's because she is a soon to be a twice divorced American, and the King as head of The Church of England... cannot marry a divorced woman.
And Sir, I apologize for the nature of this.
According to Scotland Yard, the King has not always possess exclusive rights
to Mrs. Simpson's...
favours and affections, sharing them with a married used car salesman, a certain Mr. Guy Trundle.
In addition, it is also rumoured...
Hitler's ambassador, Count von Ribbentrop, sends her 17 carnations every day.
Should His Majesty continues to ignore the advice of His Government, He must abdicate.
Otherwise His Government has no choice but to resign.
Prime Minister, you'd leave the country without...
a government?
Does the King do what he wants, or does he do what his people expect him to do?
What's the matter, love?
I'm Just having trouble with a patient.
That Isn't like you..
why?
He's scared...
He is afraid with his own shadow.
Isn't that why they come to you?
This fellow could be somebody great, and he's fighting me.
Perhaps, he doesn't want to be great.
Perhaps that's what you want.
I might have overstepped the mark.
Apologize,
Do you both good.
I'm very sorry, Mr. Logue, the Duke is busy.
I'm happy to wait.
Or I could come back later.
As I said, the Duke is terribly busy.
Thank you.
The parliament will not support their marriage.
But there were other reasons for concern, Sir.
He was careless with state papers.
He lacked commitment and resolve.
There were those that worried where he would stand when war comes with Germany.
We're not coming to that?
Indeed we are, Sir.
Prime Minister Baldwin may deny this, but Hitler's intent is crystal clear.
War with Germany will come, and we will need a King behind whom we can all stand united.
I fear... my brother is not of sound mind, at this time.
Have you thought what you will call yourself?
Certainly not Albert, Sir.
Too Germanic.
What about George?
After your father?
George the sixth.
It has rather a nice continuity to it, don't you think?
David!
Thank God.
You look exhausted!
How are you bearing up?
Bertie.
The decision's been made.
I have to go.
I cannot accept that.
You are in no condition to make that decision.
I'm afraid there's no other way.
I must marry her.
My mind's made up.
I'm... sorry.
That's a terrible thing to hear.
David, nobody wants that.
I least of all.
" At long last I am able to say, a few words of my own.
I have never wanted to withhold anything, but until now, it has not been constitutionally possible for me to speak.
A few hours ago, I discharged my last duty as King and Emperor.
Now that I have been succeeded by my brother, the Duke of York my first words must be to declare my allegiance to him.
This I do with all my heart.
You all know the reasons which have impelled me to renounce the throne.
But you must believe me, when I tell you
That I have found it impossible to carry the heavy burden of responsibility and to discharge my duties as King as I would wish to do without the help and support of the woman I love...
And I want you to know, this decision has been made less difficult to me by the sure knowledge that my brother, with his long training in the public affairs of this country, and with his fine qualities,
will be able to take my place forth with without interruption or injury to the life and progress of the empire.
I meet you today... in circumstances which are -
Mama, will we have space for our horses in our new home?
Of course we will, darling, we'll have a palace of rooms.
Curtsey.
Your Majesty.
How was it?
I'm trying to familiarise myself with what a state paper looks like.
A dispatch from Mr. Baldwin which I don't understand a word of.
David's finances.
The Christmas broadcast -
I think that might be a mistake.
Plans for the Coronation -
I think that's an even bigger mistake.
I'm not a King.
I'm a naval officer.
It's the only thing I know.
I'm not a King.
Dear, dear man...
You know...
i refused your first two marriage proposals, not because I didn't love you, but because I couldn't bear the royal cage.
Couldn't bear the idea of a life of tours and public duties, a life that no longer was really to be my own.
But then I thought... he stammers so beautifully... they'll leave us alone.
Waiting for a king to apologize, one can wait rather a long wait.
I'm afraid we're slightly late.
This is home.
Myrtle's at bridge.
I've made sure the boys are out.
It's lovely.
Absolutely lovely.
Would you like some tea, Ma'am?
Yes.
I'll help myself.
Off you go...
Or must I knock your heads together?
Here's your shilling,
I understand... what you were trying to say, Logue.
I went about it the wrong way.
I'm sorry.
Now here I am.
Is the nation ready for two minutes of radio silence?
Every stammered always fears they will fall back to square one.
I don't let that happen.
If I fail in my duty...
David could come back.
I've seen the placards
Save Our King!
They don't mean me.
Every other monarch in history succeeded someone who was dead, or just about to be.
My predecessor is not only alive, but very much so.
What a bloody mess!
I can't even give them a Christmas Speech.
Like your Dad used to do?
Precisely.
He's not here anymore.
Yes he is.
He's on that shilling I gave you.
Easy enough to give away.
You don't have to carry him around in your pocket.
Or your brother.
You don't need to be afraid of the things as you were afraid of when you were five.
You're very much your own man, Bertie.
Am I?
Your face is next, mate.
Lionel?
Myrtle!
- Is it alright?
- Yes.
Bertie, come here.
- Are you alright, Logue?
- Yes.
- Shall we go through?
- Trust me.
It's important.
What is it?
- Your...
Your...
- It's Your Majesty... the first time.
After that, it's Ma'am, as in Ham, not Ma'Im as in Palm.
I haven't told her about us.
Sit down, relax.
I'm told your husband calls my husband Bertie and my husband calls your husband Lionel.
I trust you won't call me Liz.
Your Majesty, you may call me Mrs. Logue, Ma'am.
Very nice to meet you, Mrs. Logue.
Logue, we can't stand here all day.
Yes we can.
Look, I need to wait for the right moment.
- Logue, you're being a coward!
- You're damn right.
Get out there, man!
Hello, Myrtle darling!
You're early.
I believe you two have met!
But I didn't think, you know...
King George the Sixth.
- It's very nice to meet you.
Will their Majesties be staying to dinner?
We would love to, such a treat, but alas... a previous engagement.
What a pity.
- Archbishop.
- Welcome, your Majesty.
What a glorious transformation, Sir.
I hope you'll forgive us if we continue out preparations.
And now you will allow me to guide you through the ceremony.
We begin of course at the West door, then into the nave.
I see you all your pronouncements are to be broadcast, Archbishop.
Ah, yes, wireless is indeed a Pandora's Box.
I'm afraid I also have to permit the newsreel cameras.
The product of which I shall personally edit.
Without momentary hesitation.
This is Doctor Logue of Harley Street.
He's my speech therapist.
- Your Grace.
- Had I known that Your Majesty was seeking assistance
I should've made my own recommendation.
Dr. Logue... will be attending the Coronation.
Well of course I shall speak with the Dean, but it was extremely difficult.
I should like the Doctor to be seated in the King's Box.
But members of your Family will be seated there, Sir.
That is why it's suitable.
And now, if you don't mind Your Grace, we need the premises.
My dear fellow, this is Westminster Abbey!
The Church must prepare his Majesty.
My preparations are equalized in important
With complete privacy, if you don't mind.
Those are my wishes, Your Grace.
I shall place the Abbey at Your Majesty's disposal... this evening.
Your Majesty.
I can't believe I'm walking on Chaucer and Handel and Dickens.
Everything alright?
Let's get cracking.
I'm not here to rehearse, Doctor Logue.
Call me Lionel.
True, you... never...
called yourself "Doctor. "
I did that... for you.
No training, no... diploma, no... qualifications.
Just a... great deal of nerve.
The star chamber inquisition, is this?
You asked trust and... total equality.
Bertie, I heard you at Wembley.
I was there.
My son Laurie said Dad, do you think you could help that poor man?
What, as a failed actor!
?
It's true, I'm not a doctor, and yes I acted a bit,
Well I recited in pubs and taught elocution in schools.
When the Great War came, all our Soldiers were returning straight from the front, a lot of them shell-shocked, unable to speak
somebody said, Lionel, you're very good at all this speech stuff.
Do you think you can possibly help these poor buggers.
I did muscle therapy, exercise, relaxation, but I knew I had to go deeper.
These poor young blokes had cried out in fear, no-one was listening to them.
My job was to give them faith in their own voice and let them know that a friend was listening.
That must ring a few bells with you, Bertie.
You give a very noble account of yourself.
Make inquiries.
It's all true.
Inquiries have been made!
You have no idea who I have breathing down my neck?
I vouched for you and you have no...
credentials.
But lots of success!
I can't show you certificate - there was no training then.
Everything I know I know from experience, and that war... was some experience.
My plaque says, "L. Logue, Speech Defects. "
No Dr., there are no letters after my name.
Lock me in the Tower.
- I would if I could!
- On what charge?
- Fraud!
With war looming, you've saddled this nation with a voiceless King.
You destroyed the happiness of my family.
All for the sake of ensnaring a star... patient you couldn't possibly hope to assist!
It'll be like mad...
King George the Third, there'll be mad King George the stammerer, who let his people down so badly in their hour of need!
What're you doing?
Get up!
You can't sit there!
Get up!
Why not?
It's a chair.
No, that's not a chair, that is... that is...
That is Saint Edward's Chair!
- People have carved their names on it.
That chair is the seat on which every King and Queen-
- It's held in a place by a large rock!
- That's the Stone of Scone, you are trivialising everything.
- You believe such bollocks.
- You're trivialising everything!
- I don't care how many royal...
- Listen to me.
Listen to me!
- ... arse have sat in this chair.
- Listen to me...!
- Listen to you?
!
By what right?
By the divine right, if you must!
I'm your King!
No you're not!
You told me so yourself.
You said you didn't want it.
Why should I waste my time listening to you?
- Because I have a right to be heard!
- Heard as what?
!
- I HAVE A VOICE!
Yes you do.
You have such a perseverance, Bertie, you're the bravest man I know.
And you'll make a bloody good king.
- What on earth's going on, Sir?
- It's quite alright, Archbishop.
Mr. Logue, you must know that I found a replacement English specialist with impeccable credentials.
Hence, your services will no longer be required.
- I'm sorry?
- Your Majesty's function is to consult and be advised.
And you didn't consult, but you've just been advised.
Now I advise you: in this personal matter I will make my own decision.
My concern is for the head upon which I must place the crown.
I appreciate that Archbishop, but it's my head!
Your humble servant.
Thank you Bertie.
Shall we rehearse?
Come on up on your purge.
Now when you and Elizabeth enter through the West door, you'll be greeted by the hymn I Was Glad When They Said Unto Me.
Actually you won't be that glad, because they sing it for a very long time.
Then your friend the Archbishop will ponce up the stairs toward you and say Sir, is Your Majesty willing to take The Oath?
- I am willing..
- Course you are!
I'm gonna see what it sounds like in the cheap seats so even your old nanny can hear.
Will you govern your peoples of Great Britain, Ireland, Canada,
Australia and New Zealand according to their lands and customs?
- "I solemnly promise so do so. "
- LOUDER!
I can't hear you up the back.
I SOLEMNLY PROMISE TO DO SO!
Very good!
"Will you to your power cause Law and Justice, in Mercy, to be executed in all your judgments?"
"I will. " I WILL!
Then there's a very long bit about upholding the faith, goes on, rubbish, rubbish, rubbish.
To which you finally say...
"The things which I have herebefore promised, I will perform and keep"
"So help me God. "
And that's all you'll say.
Four short responses, kiss the book and sign the oath and you're King.
Easy.
You nearly crowned him backwards Archbishop!
Someone had removed the thread marking the back of the Crown, Sir.
Try not lose the thread, Archbishop.
Archbishop, we're missing Papa.
Very good, very good.
Archbishop.
Well, I hope Your Majesties are thrilled with the result.
You could switch that machine off now.
No, wait, keep going.
Do have a seat, Archbishop.
Movie commentary
Movie commentary
- Papa?
- Mmm?
- Papa, what's he saying?
I don't know, but he seems to be saying it rather well.
Sir, I have asked to see you today in order to tender my resignation as Prime Minister.
I am so sorry to hear that, Mr. Baldwin.
Neville Chamberlain will take my place as Prime Minister.
It's a matter of principal.
I was mistaken.
I have found it impossible to believe that there is any man in the World so lacking in moral feeling as Hitler,
but the world might be hurled for a second time into the abyss of destructive War.
Churchill was right all along.
This was always Hitler's intention.
I am many very sorry to leave you in this great time of crisis.
I am very much afraid Sir, that your greatest test is yet to come.
I am speaking to you from the cabinet room at 10 Downing Street.
This morning the British Ambassador in Berlin handed the German Government a final note
stating that unless we heard from them by 11 o'clock that they were prepared at once to withdraw their troops from Poland, a state of war would exist between us.
I have to tell you now that no such undertaking has been received, and that consequently this country is at war with Germany.
At last Sir, here is your speech.
You are on air at six.
I've timed it to just under nine minutes.
The wording is fully approved.
The Prime Minister will be joining you for the broadcast which will go out live across the Nation, the Empire and to our Armed Forces.
Get Logue here immediately.
- There's the barrage balloons.
- Yes.
They got them up there quickly.
Yeah.
- Should we pull over and find shelter?
- No, go straight on.
We'll be alright
- Yes.
Sir?
- Lionel Logue.
Major Hartley's expecting me.
This is my son Laury.
- Thank you, Laurie.
- Good luck, Dad.
- The King's Speech.
- Thank you, Sir.
We have about forty minutes until the broadcast.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
There may be dark days ahead, and... "
Try again.
There may be dark days ahead, and... "
Turn the hesitations into pauses, and say to yourself, God save the King..
I say that continuously, but apparently no one's listening.
Long pauses are good: they add solemnity to great occasions.
Then I'm the solemnest king who ever lived.
And Lionel, if I am to be King...
where is my power?
Can I...
Can I form a Government?
Can I...
Can I levy a tax or declare a war?
No!
Yet I am the seat of all authority.
Why?
Because the Nation believes that when I speak, I speak for them.
Yet I cannot speak!
Let's take it all again from the top.
In this grave hour...
In this grave hour fuck fuck fuck perhaps the most fateful in our history bugger shit shit
I send to every household of my...
You see "P" is always difficult, even when I'm singing.
Bounce onto it "a-peoples", not "people".
a- people household of me...
aaa-peoples both at home and overseas... "
Beautiful.
...this message, doo-dah, spoken with the same depth of feeling, doo-dah-dey, ...for each one of you as if I were able to shit fuck bugger cross your threshold and speak to you
In your head, now:
I have a right to be bloody well heard!
Bloody well heard, bloody well heard, bloody well heard myself!
Now Waltz.
Move!
Get continuous movement.
For the second time in the lives of most of us we are at...
- we are...
Take a pause.
- Lionel, I can't do this.
Bertie, you can do it.
- Have a look at the last paragraph.
- Bertie, it's time.
There he is.
- Archbishop.
- Your Majesty.
A great moment, Sir.
- Prime Minister.
- Your Majesty.
Nice to see you again, so soon.
Good of you to be here, I'm sure you've had rather a busy day.
Let's hope we have no more interruptions from those damned sirens, Sir.
Or the wretched dogs.
- Congratulations.
First Lord of the Admiralty.
- Your Majesty.
The long walk.
Good luck, Sir.
I too dread this apparatus.
Had a speech impediment myself, you know.
- I didn't.
- Family secret.
Tongue-tied.
An operation was considered to be too dangerous.
I eventually made an asset of it.
- Thank you, Mr. Churchill.
- Good, Sir.
Darling.
- How long, Logue?
- Just under three minutes, Sir.
Five seconds, Sir.
5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
- Mr. Wood.
- Good luck, Your Majesty.
Mr. Wood.
- You'll be decorated, Logue.
- I made it cosy.
Some fresh air.
There you are, Darling.
I'm thistle sifter, I've a sieve of sifted thistles and a sieve on unsifted thistles.
I've a sieve of sifted thistles and a sieve on unsifted thistles, because I'm...
Bertie, darling, make sure it's not switched on!
Remember the red light will blink four times and then I've asked them to turn it off, because we don't want that evil eye staring at you all the way through.
One minute, sir.
I am sure you will be splendid.
Fourty seconds, Sir.
Logue, however this turns out,
I don't know how to thank you for what you've done.
Knighthood?
Twenty seconds.
Forget everything else and just say it to me.
Say it to me, as a friend.
In this grave hour,
perhaps the most fateful in our history,
I send to every household of my peoples,
both at home
and overseas
this message spoken with the same depth of feeling
for each one of you as if I were able to cross your threshold
and speak to you myself.
For the second time in the lives of most of us we are at... at war.
Over and over again we have tried to find
a peaceful way out of the differences between ourselves and those who are now our enemies.
But it has been in vain.
We have been forced into a conflict.
For we are called, to meet the challenge of a principle which, if it were to prevail, would be fatal to any civilized order
in the world.
Such a principle, stripped of all disguise,
is surely the mere
primitive doctrine that might is right.
For the sake of all that we ourselves hold dear, it is unthinkable that we should refuse to meet the challenge.
It is to this high purpose that I now call my people at home and my peoples across the seas, who will make our cause their own.
I ask them to stand calm and firm, and united in this time of trial
the task will be hard.
There may be dark days ahead, and war can no longer be confined to the battlefield.
But we can only do the right as we see the right and reverently commit our cause to God.
If one and all we keep resolutely faithful to it, then, with God's help,
we shall prevail.
Very good, Bertie.
You still stammered on the w..
Had to throw in a few so they knew it was me.
Congratulations, your Majesty.
A true broadcaster.
Thank you, Mr. Wood.
Congratulations, your Majesty.
- Congratulations, your Majesty.
- Thank you.
Ready.
- Good?
- Perfect.
Your first war time speech.
Congratulations.
Expect I shall have to do a great deal more.
Thank you, Logue.
Well done, my friend.
Thank you, Your Majesty.
I knew you'd be good.
Thank you, Lionel.
Onwards?
Congratulations, Sir.
Almost did it better then myself, Sir.
Your Majesty, I'm speechless.
Congratulations, Sir.
Gentlemen.
Congratulations, your Majesty.
So how was Papa, Elizabeth?
Halting at first, but you got much better Papa.
Bless you.
- And how about you, Margaret?
- You were just splendid, Papa.
Of course I was.
We all ready?
Come on girls.
You're live in two minutes, Your Royal Highness.
Sir?
Thank you.
Let the microphone do the work, sir.
I'm sure you'll be splendid.
Just take your time.
Time to go.
Good afternoon.
"This is the BBC National Program and Empire Service taking you to Wembley Stadium for the closing ceremony Of the Empire Exhibition.
...Where His Royal Highness, the Duke of York, will read a message from his father;
His Majesty King George V."
"Fifty eight British colonies and dominions have taken part,... making this the largest exhibition staged anywhere in the world."
Remember, sir, three flashes, then steady red means you're live.
"Using the new invention of radio, the opening ceremony was the first time His Majesty the King addressed his subjects on the wireless."
"At the close of the first season, ...the heir to the throne, His Royal Highness, the Prince of Wales, made his first broadcast, and today, his younger brother, His Royal Highness, the Duke of York, will give his inaugural broadcast to the nation and the world."
I have received from His Majesty the the the King...
Inhale deep into your lungs, Your Royal Highness.
Relaxes your larynx, does it not?
Cigarette smoking calms the nerves, and gives you confidence.
Now, if Your Royal Highness would be so kind as to open your hand.
It's Sterilized.
Now..
One, two, three, four, five, six seven.
Now, if I may take the liberty, insert them into your mouth?
Excuse me, Doctor.
What is the purpose of this?
It's the classic approach.
It cured Demosthenes.
That was in Ancient Greece...uh Has it worked since?
Now, if you would be so kind as to read.
"A wealth of words."
Fight against those marbles, Your Royal Highness.
Enunciate.
A little more concentration, Your Royal Highness.
I nearly swallowed the bloody things!
Thank you so much, Doctor.
It's been most, um...
- ...interesting.
- Your Royal Highness.
Insert marbles.
He can insert his own bloody marbles.
Tick, tock.
Tick, tock.
You know you can't keep doing this, Bertie.
- I know.
- Mmm.
Promise me...
Promise me no more.
Ah!
Hello?
- Is anyone there?
- I'm just in the loo.
Ah, Mrs. Johnson, there you are.
I'm sorry, I don't have a receptionist.
I like to keep things simple.
"Poor and content is rich and rich enough."
- I'm sorry?
- Shakespeare.
How are you?
- How do you do?
- Oh, chuffing along.
Um, now, this is slightly awkward, but I'm afraid you're late.
- Yes.
I'm afraid I am.
- Where's Mr. Johnson?
Ah...
He doesn't know I'm here.
Well, that's not a very promising start.
No.
No, look, my husband has seen everyone To no avail.
I'm awfully afraid he's given up hope.
- He hasn't seen me.
- You're awfully sure of yourself.
Well, I'm sure of anyone who wants to be cured.
Of course he wants to be cured.
My husband is, um...
- Well, he's required to speak publicly.
- Perhaps he should change jobs?
- He can't.
- Indentured servitude?
Something of that nature, yes.
Well, we need to have your hubby pop by.
Uh...
Tuesday would be good.
He can give me his personal details, I'll make a frank appraisal...
- ...and then we'll take it from there.
- Doctor, forgive me.
Uh, I don't have a "hubby." We don't "pop."
And nor do we ever talk about our private lives.
No, you must come to us.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Johnson, my game, my turf, my rules.
Mmm.
You'll have to talk this over with your husband, and then you can speak to me on the telephone.
Thank you very much for dropping by...
Good afternoon.
And what if my husband were the Duke of York?
- The Duke of York?
- Yes...
The Duke of York.
I thought the appointment was for Johnson.
Forgive me, Your...
- Royal Highness.
- ...
Royal Highness.
Yes, Johnson was used during the Great War, when the Navy didn't want the enemy
- ...to know he was aboard.
- Am I...considered the enemy?
You will be, if you remain un-obliging.
You'll appreciate the need for absolute discretion.
Of course.
How did you find me, Your Royal Highness?
The President of The Society For Speech Therapists.
Eileen McCleod?
She's a sport.
Dr McCleod warned me your antipodean methods were both "unorthodox" and "controversial."
I warned her those are not my favourite words.
I can cure your husband.
But for my method to work, I need trust and total equality, here in the safety of my consultation room.
No exceptions.
Oh, well then...
In that case...
When can you start?
- She's still sounding a bit rough, mate.
- You make me drive too slowly, Dad!
- Did you pick Mum up from bridge?
- Yeah, I've hardly been out of the car.
I had a special visitor this afternoon.
- May I please leave the table?
- How special's special?
No, you must stay, bored stupid, listening to your parents' inane conversation.
- Thanks, Dad...
- And Mum.
- And Mum.
- Me, too.
- You meeting Jean?
- No.
Someone else.
- Doctor?
Doctor?
- Hmm?
Go and help your brother with the washing up.
- I'm fine.
- Who is it, Lionel?
Why bring it up if you can't talk about it?
Myrtle, it's just a woman looking to help her husband.
Oh, and I had a call... for an audition.
- One of my favourites.
- Aren't they all?
It Could be a lot of fun.
I'm sure you'll be splendid.
In the amateur scene, they're a highly regarded group.
From Putney.
No, that's all girls.
Tomorrow, chapter four, "The Flight."
Mama, I long to know where they fly to.
- I can't wait!
- Oh, to fly away.
Weren't they lucky?
Now Papa, tell a story.
Can't I be a penguin instead?
Well, no, I want a penguin story.
Very quickly.
Once there were...
two princesses.
Princess Elizabeth and Princess Margaret, whose papa was a penguin.
This was because he'd been turned into one by a wicked witch.
This was very inconvenient for him because he loved to hold his princesses in his arms.
But you can't if you're a penguin because you...
- ...you have wings like herrings.
- Herrings don't have wings.
Penguins have wings which are...
are shaped like herrings.
And what made matters worse is that she... she sent him to the South Pole, which is an awfully long walk back if if you can't fly.
So when he reached the water, he he dived in, through the depths, so fast that he was in Southampton Waters by lunchtime.
And from there, he took the 2:30 to Weybridge, changed at Clapham Junction, asked a a passing mallard the way to Buckingham Palace, swam up The Thames, out through the plughole and gave the cook, Mama and Mrs. Whittaker quite a shock.
Now, when the girls heard all the commotion, they ran to the kitchen, where they gave him a a good scrub, a mackerel and a kiss.
And as they kissed him guess what he turned into?
- A handsome prince.
- A short-tailed albatross.
- Oh.
- With wings so big, that he could wrap them both around his two girls together.
Now, girls.
Time for bed.
Come on.
- And take those horses to the stable.
- Quickly, now.
- You have exactly a minute.
- Good night.
Feed them, brush them and to bed.
- Will Mrs. Simpson be there?
- My brother's insisting.
- Is he serious?
- About her coming to dinner?
No.
About her.
- A married woman?
He can't be.
- She can.
By the way, I think I've found someone rather interesting.
On Harley Street.
A doctor.
Out of the question.
I'm not having this conversation again.
Mat...
Matter's settled.
Mmm.
His approach seems rather different.
Now?
Now.
Now is the winter of our discontent, made glorious summer by this sun of York.
And all the clouds that lour'd upon our house
In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.
Now are our brows bound with... victorious... wreaths;
Thank you.
- Lovely diction, Mr...?
- Logue.
Lionel Logue.
Well, Mr. Logue,
I'm not hearing the cries of a deformed creature yearning to be king.
Nor did I realize Richard III was King of the Colonies.
I do know all the lines.
I've played the role before.
- Sydney?
- Perth.
Major theatre town, is it?
- Enthusiastic.
- Ah.
I was well reviewed.
Yes.
Well, Lionel, I think our dramatic society is looking for someone slightly younger.
And a...
little more regal.
- There you are.
- Thank you.
- Oh.
- Mmm.
No, you have to shut that one first.
Close that one first.
That's it.
Where did you find this... physician?
Classifieds.
Next to a "French model, Shepherd's Market."
No, he comes highly recommended.
Charges substantial fees to help the poor.
Oh, dear.
Perhaps he's a Bolshevik.
Ah, there's no receptionist.
Likes to keep things simple.
Uh...
The Johnsons.
You can go in now, Mr. Johnson.
Lionel says wait here if you wish, Mrs. Johnson.
Or, it being a pleasant day...
P...perhaps take a stroll.
Was that all right, Lionel?
Marvelous, Willie.
You can stay here and wait for your mum.
Mrs. Johnson.
Mr. Johnson.
Do come in.
Would you like a sweetie?
He's a good lad, Willie.
He could hardly make a sound, you know, when he first came to me.
My boys make those.
They're good, aren't they?
Please, make yourself comfortable.
I was told not to sit too close.
Well I believe when speaking with a prince,
One waits for the prince to choose the topic.
Waiting for me to...
Ah, yes, well...
Do you know any jokes?
- Timing isn't my strong suit.
- Cup of tea?
- No.
No, thank you.
- I think I'll have one.
Aren't you going to start treating me, Dr. Logue?
Only if you're interested in being treated.
Please, call me Lionel.
No, I... prefer Doctor.
I prefer Lionel.
- What will I call you?
- Your Royal Highness.
Then... it's "sir" after that.
It's a little bit formal for here.
I prefer names.
Prince Albert Frederick Arthur George?
How about Bertie?
- Only my family uses that.
- Perfect.
In here, it's better if we're equals.
If... if we were equals, I wouldn't be here.
I'd be... at home with my wife, and no one would give a damn.
Please, don't do that.
I'm sorry?
I believe sucking smoke into your lungs, well, it will kill you.
My physicians say it relaxes the...
- ...the throat.
- They're idiots.
- They've all been knighted.
- Makes it official, then.
My castle, my rules.
Thank you.
What was your earliest memory?
- What on earth do you mean?
- Your first recollection.
I'm not here to discuss personal matters.
- Well, why are you here, then?
- Because I bloody well stammer!
- You have a bit of a temper.
- One of my many faults.
- When did the defect start?
- I've always been this way.
- I doubt that.
- Don't...
- ...tell me, it's my stammer.
- It's my field.
I can assure you, no infant starts to speak with a stammer.
When did yours start?
- Four or five.
- That's typical.
So I've been told.
I...
I can't remember not doing it.
I can believe that.
Do you hesitate when you think?
- Don't be ridiculous.
- How about when you talk to yourself?
Everyone natters to themselves occasionally, Bertie.
Stop...
Stop calling me that.
I'm not going to call you anything else.
Then we shan't speak.
Are you charging for this, Doctor?
A fortune.
I'll just let that brew.
So... when you talk to yourself, do you stammer?
No... of course not.
Well, that proves that your impediment isn't a permanent part of you.
What do you think was the cause?
I don't... don't know.
I...
I don't...
I don't care.
I...
I stammer.
No one can fix it.
I'll bet you that you can read flawlessly, right here, right now.
And if I win the bet, I get to ask you more questions.
- And if I win?
- You don't have to answer them.
One usually... wagers money.
A bob each to keep it sweet?
- Let's see your shilling.
- I don't... carry money.
I had a funny feeling you mightn't.
I'll stake you, and you can pay me back next time.
- If there is a next time.
- I haven't agreed to take you on yet.
So please stand, uh, and take a look at that.
From there.
I...
I can't read this.
Well, then you owe me a shilling for not trying.
To be or not to be, that...
- Can't read it.
- Uh-uh-uh!
I haven't finished yet.
I'm going to record your voice and then play it back to you on the same machine.
This is brilliant.
It's the latest thing from America.
It's a Silvertone.
Pop these on.
There's a bob in this, mate.
You could go home rich.
- You're playing music!
- I know.
So how can I hear what I'm saying?
Well, surely a prince's brain knows what its mouth's doing?
You're not... well acquainted with royal princes, are you?
Hopeless.
Hopeless!
You were sublime.
Would I lie to a prince of the realm to win 12 pennies?
I've no idea what an Australian might do for that sort of money.
Let me play it back to you.
No.
All right, then, well, I get to ask you the questions.
Thank you, Doctor.
I don't feel this is for me.
Thank you for your time.
Goodbye.
Sir?
The recording is free.
Please keep it as a souvenir.
No.
Oh, well.
Bugger.
For the present, the work to which we are all equally bound, is to arrive at a reasoned tranquillity within our borders, ...to regain prosperity at this time of depression without self-seeking, and to carry with us
those whom the burden of the past years has disheartened or overborne.
To all, to each, I wish a happy Christmas.
God bless you.
And off air.
Easy when you know how.
Sir?
Have a go yourself.
- Congratulations, sir.
- Ah, Mr. Wood.
Splendid fellow.
Chap who taught me everything I know.
- Let the microphone do the work.
- Sir.
- Thank you.
- Gentlemen.
Sit up.
Straight back.
Face boldly up to the bloody thing and stare it square in the eye, as would any decent Englishman.
Show who's in command.
Papa, I d...don't... thu...thu...
think I c... c... can read this.
This devilish device will change everything if you don't.
In the past, all a king had to do was look respectable in uniform and not fall off his horse.
Now, we must invade people's homes and ingratiate ourselves with them.
This family's been reduced to those lowest, basest of all creatures.
We've become actors.
We're not a family, we're a firm.
Yet at any moment, some of us may be out of work.
Your darling brother and future king, the only wife he appears interested in is invariably the wife of another.
- He's broken off with Lady Furness.
- And taken up with Mrs. Simpson.
A woman with two husbands living.
I told him straight.
No divorced person can ever be received at court.
He said it made him sublimely happy.
I imagine that was because she was sleeping with him.
"I give you my word," this is what he said.
"I give you my word, we've never had immoral relations."
Stared square into his father's face and lied.
When I'm dead, that boy will ruin himself, this family and this nation within 12 months.
Who will pick up the pieces, hmm?
Herr Hitler intimidating half of Europe.
Marshal Stalin the other half.
Who will stand between us, the jackboots and the proletarian abyss?
You?
Well?
With your older brother shirking his duties, you're going to have to do a lot more of this.
Have a go yourself.
Through the wireless...
- Get it out, boy.
...one of the m... marvels of m...
"Modern." Just take your time.
Form your words carefully.
...science I am enabled, this ...
Relax.
Just try it!
...this Christmas Day to speak to all my...
Do it!
Lying... bastard.
- You're playing music.
- I know.
So how can I...
hear what I'm saying?
Well, surely a prince's brain knows what its mouth's doing.
You're not... well acquainted with royal princes, are you?
"To be or not be, that is the question.
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, or to take arms against a sea of troubles, and by opposing end them?
To die, to sleep no more, and by a sleep to say the end is the heartache and the thousand natural shocks the flesh is heir to:
'tis a consummation hopeless."
Hopeless!
Strictly business.
No...
- ...personal nonsense.
- Yes, I thought I'd made that clear...
- ...in our interview.
- Have you got the shilling you owe me?
- No, I haven't.
- Didn't think so.
Besides, you... you tricked me.
Physical exercises and tricks are important, but what you're asking will only deal with the surface of the problem.
Is that sufficient?
Uh, no.
As far as I see it, my husband has mechanical difficulties with his speech.
- I...
- Maybe just deal with that.
I...
- I'm willing to work hard, Dr. Logue.
- Lionel.
Are you...
Are you willing to do your part?
All right.
You want mechanics?
We need to relax your jaw muscles, strengthen your tongue, by repeating tongue twisters.
For example, "I'm a thistle-sifter.
I have a sieve of sifted thistles and a sieve of unsifted thistles.
- Because I am a thistle-sifter."
- Fine.
And you do have a flabby tummy, so we'll need to spend some time strengthening your diaphragm.
Simple mechanics.
- That's all we ask.
- All that's about a shilling's worth.
Forget about the blessed shilling!
Perhaps, upon occasions you might be requested to assist in coping with with some minor event.
Would that be agreeable?
Of course.
Yes, and that would be the full extent of your services.
- Shall I see you next week?
- I shall see you every day.
Ahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahah.
Feel the looseness of the jaw.
Good.
Little bounces.
Bounces.
Shoulders loose, shoulders loose.
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful.
Now, loose.
Take a nice deep breath.
Expand the chest.
Put your hands onto your ribs.
Deeper.
Good.
- How do you feel?
- Full of hot air.
Isn't that what public speaking's all about?
My wife and I are glad to visit this important...
Take a good deep breath, and up comes Your Royal Highness.
And slowly exhale, and down comes Your Royal Highness.
- You all right, Bertie?
- Yes.
It's actually quite good fun.
Mmm...
Mother.
Shorten the humming each time.
Mother.
Mmm manufacturing district...
- Another deep breath.
- And Jack and Jill.
- Jack and Jill.
- Went up the hill.
- Went up the hill.
Now, just sway.
Perfect.
...will not permit us to...
- Loosen the shoulders.
Ding dong bell, pussy's in the well.
Who put her in?
Little Tommy Tin.
You have a short memory, Bertie.
Come on.
- A cow, a cow...
- A king.
A... a king...
Anyone who can shout vowels at an open window can learn to deliver a speech.
- Fourteen, 15!
- Good.
Deep breath, and...
It is...
- Let the words flow.
- No, it doesn't bloody work.
Come on, one more time, Bertie.
You can do it.
A sieve of thisted siphles.
Gah!
Mah!
Bah!
Father.
- Father.
- Father.
- Aim for the a-t-h.
- Father.
- Father.
- Father.
Father.
Father.
- Hello, Bertie.
- Hello, David.
- Nice of you to come out.
- Not at all.
You been waiting long?
Christ, bloody freezing.
Where have you been?
- I've been busy.
- So have I.
- Elizabeth has pneumonia.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- She'll recover.
- Father won't.
I'll drive.
Old bugger's doing this on purpose.
- Dying?
- Departing prematurely.
To...
To complicate matters with Wallis.
For heaven's sake, David.
You know how long he's been ill.
Wallis explained.
She's terribly clever about these things.
Whereas my letters patent under the Great Seal bearing date of Westminster the 11th day of June 1912,
His Majesty King George the Fifth did constitute order and declare that there should be a Guardian...
- What's going on here?
- ...custos regne...
I cannot follow you.
I'm confused and I don't understand...
It's the Order of the Council of State, sir.
So that we may act on your behalf much clearer to me, I'm afraid...
- Well, I'm so confused that...
- Approved.
Thank you.
- Let me help you, sir.
- Ah, yes...
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.
- Feeling a little better, sir?
- No, I'm not feeling any better.
I feel dreadful.
Ah...
Been, uh, ice skating?
Ice skating?
No.
No, George.
Yes.
Yes, all right, of course.
I know, darling.
A talk, even a lovely long talk is a poor substitute for holding tight and making drowsy.
Nor making our own drowsies either, as we've had to do too often lately.
- David.
Dinner.
- I'm on with Wallis.
It's Bertie.
No.
No, it's not important.
I don't want to.
No.
Telephone me later?
All right, goodbye.
- Wallis misses me terribly.
- Mama says you're late for dinner.
She forgets Papa's bloody clocks are all half an hour fast.
How's the King?
I...
I hope he's not in pain.
No, no, sir.
His Majesty's quieter now.
Thank you.
David, if your father were here, tardiness would not be tolerated.
None of this unpleasantness would be tolerated.
You know, sir, I appreciate that you are different from your father, both in outlook and... temperament.
I want you to know that whenever the King questioned your conduct,
I tried, in your interest, to present it in the most favourable light.
Mmm.
I can always trust you to have my best interests at heart.
I fear our vigil will not be of long duration.
Please continue.
Let us commend our brother George to the mercy of God,
Our Maker and Redeemer.
Long live the King.
I hope I will make good as he has made good.
- What on earth was that?
- Poor Wallis.
Now, I'm trapped.
And in these last 25 crowded, troubled, glorious years, if there is one thing that King George has taught, it is the art of the leader who is also a brother to his followers.
As long as he lived, he was the guiding star of a great nation.
- Dad?
- Mmm-hmm?
- When he died...
- Time for a Shake, Dad?
... the little children cried in the streets.
- You sure?
- Go on.
Put your thinking caps on.
- I bet it's the Scottish play.
- No, it's Othello.
It's always Othello.
Art thou afeard?
- Be not afeard.
- Caliban.
Oh, for heaven's sake.
That was a lucky guess.
Don't listen to egghead.
Go on, Dad.
The isle is full of noises, sounds and sweet airs that give delight, and hurt not.
Sometimes a thousand twangling instruments will hum about mine ears, and sometimes voices, that, if then I had waked after long sleep, will make me sleep again.
All right, clever clogs, so what comes next?
And then, in dreaming, methought the clouds would...
- The clouds methought.
- The clouds methought would open, and show riches ready to drop upon me, that when I waked, I cried to dream again.
That's such a sad thought.
My next patient must be a bit early.
You better go, lads, I'm sorry.
Won't be a moment, Clifford.
Bertie?
They told me not to expect you.
I'm sorry about your father.
- I don't wish to intrude.
- Not at all.
Please, come in.
Come in.
I've been practicing.
An hour a day.
In spite of everything.
What's going on there?
Oh, I was...
Sorry.
Mucking around with my kids.
Do you feel like working today?
- A Curtis bi-plane.
- I'll put on some hot milk.
Logue.
Logue.
I'd kill for something stronger.
I wasn't there for my father's death.
- Still makes me sad.
- I can imagine so.
- What did your father do?
- He was a brewer.
At least there was free beer.
Here's to the memory of your father.
I was informed, after the fact, that my father's...
My father's last words were "Bertie has more guts than the rest of his brothers put together."
He couldn't say that to my face.
My brother.
What about him?
Try singing it.
- I'm sorry.
- What songs do you know?
- Songs?
- Yeah, songs.
- "Swanee River."
- I love that song.
- It happens to be my favourite.
- Sing me the chorus.
No.
Certainly not.
You know...
I always wanted to build models.
But...
Father wouldn't allow it.
He... collected stamps, so we had to collect stamps.
You can finish that off if you sing.
"My brother David Dum, dum, dum, dum..."
- I'm not going to sit here warbling.
- You can with me.
- Because you're peculiar.
- I take that as a compliment.
Well...
Rules are rules.
I'm not... crooning "Swanee River".
"Camptown Races", then.
"My brother David said to me Doo-dah, doo-dah"
- Continuous sound will give you flow.
- No.
Does it feel strange now that David's on the throne?
To tell the truth, it was a relief.
Knowing I wouldn't be...
King.
But unless he produces an heir, you're next in line.
And your daughter, Elizabeth, would then succeed you.
"You're barking up the wrong tree now, Doctor, Doctor"
"Lionel"
See?
You didn't stammer.
Of course I didn't stammer, I was singing.
Well, as a little reward, you get to put some glue on these struts.
- Your boy... won't mind?
- No, not at all.
David and I were... very close.
Young bucks, you know.
Did you chase the same girls?
David was always very helpful in... arranging introductions.
We shared the expert ministrations
Of Paulette in the Palace.
Not at the same time, of course.
- Did David ever tease you?
- Oh, yes, they all did.
"Buh-buh-buh-Bertie."
Father encouraged it.
Said, "Get it out, boy!" Said it would make me stop.
He said, "I was afraid of my father and my children are...
damn well gonna be afraid of me!"
Are you naturally right-handed?
Left.
I was... punished, and now I use the right.
Yes, that's very common with stammerers.
- Any other corrections?
- Knock knees.
Metal splints were made.
Worn... worn day and night.
- Must have been painful.
- Bloody agony.
Straight legs now.
Who were you closest to in your family?
Nannies.
Not my first nanny.
She...
She loved David.
Hated me.
When we were presented to my parents for the daily viewing, she would... she'd pinch me so that I'd cry and be handed back to her immediately.
And then she would...
Sing it.
# Then she wouldn't feed me #
# Far, far away #
Took my parents...
three years to notice.
As you... as you can imagine, caused some stomach problems.
Still.
What about your brother, Johnnie?
Were you close to him?
Johnnie... sweet boy.
Had epilepsy.
And he was... different.
He died at... 13.
Hidden from view.
I'm...
I'm told it's not... catching.
Do you want a top-up?
Please.
You know Lionel, you're you're the first ordinary Englishman...
- Australian.
- ...
I've ever really spoken to.
When I'm... driven through the streets and I see the, you know, the common man staring at me, I I'm struck by how little I know of his life and how little he knows of mine.
- Thank you.
- What are friends for?
I wouldn't know.
I sifted seven thick-stalked thistles through a strong, thick sieve.
- I sifted seven thick-stalked...
- That's enough now, darling.
Listen, I have to keep doing this, it's awful.
I sifted seven...
- Oh, no.
- ...thick-stalked...
One-hundred-year-old spruces removed to improve the view?
Who does she think she is?
Nonetheless, we must try to be pleasant towards Mrs. Simpson.
- She calls me "The Fat Scottish Cook."
- You're not fat.
I'm getting plump.
Well, you seldom cook.
- I sifted seven...
- Shut up.
...thick sieves...
I sifted seven...
Three, two, one and...
Their Royal Highnesses the Duke and Duchess of York.
Oh, how lovely to see you both.
Welcome to our little country shack.
I came at the invitation of the King.
Your Majesty.
- You all right?
- Sorry we're late.
Very nice to see you...
Mrs. Simpson.
Very nice.
Hello, David.
Making some changes to the garden, I see.
Yes, I'm not quite finished yet.
Don't tell me I behaved badly, Mr. Churchill.
On the contrary, Your Royal Highness.
Etiquette decrees that royalty should be greeted by the official host, in this case, the King.
Not a commoner.
Thank you.
- What is her hold on him?
- I've no idea.
Apparently, she has certain skills acquired in an establishment in Shanghai.
David.
Just be a sec, darling.
Would you excuse me?
- David, I've been trying to see you.
- I've been terribly busy.
- Doing what?
- Kinging.
Really?
Kinging is a a precarious business these days.
Where's the Russian tsar?
- Where's cousin Wilhelm?
- You're being dreary.
Is kinging laying off 80... staff and buying more pearls for Wallis, while people are marching across Europe singing The Red Flag?
- Herr Hitler will sort them out.
- Who will sort out Herr Hitler?
Where's the bloody 23?
And you put that woman in our mother's suite!
- Mama's not still in the bed, is she?
- That's not funny.
Here it is.
Wallis likes the very best.
I don't care what woman you carry on with at night, as long as you... show up for duty in the morning.
Wallis is not just some woman I'm carrying on with.
We intend to marry.
- Excuse me?
- She's filing a petition for divorce.
Good God.
Can't you just give her a nice house and a title?
- I'm not having her as my mistress.
- The Church doesn't recognize divorce,
- and you are the... head of the Church.
- Haven't I any rights?
- Many privileges.
- Not the same thing.
Your beloved common man may marry for love.
Why not me?
If you were... a common man,
On what basis could you...
possibly claim to be King?
Sounds like you've studied our wretched Constitution.
- Sounds like you haven't.
- That's what this is about.
Brushing up.
Hence, the elocution lessons.
- That's the scoop around town.
- I'm trying to...
Yearning for a larger audience, are we, B-B-Bertie?
Don't...
What's that?
I'm sorry, I...
Younger brother trying to push older brother off the throne.
P-P-Positively mediaeval.
Wallis.
Ah.
Where have you been all this time?
- Who have you been talking to?
- Never you mind.
What a very complicated little King you are.
I try to be.
All that work... down the drain.
My own brother.
I couldn't say a single word to him in reply.
Why do you stammer so much more with David than you ever do with me?
Because you're bloody well paid to listen.
- Bertie, I'm not a geisha girl.
- Stop trying to be so bloody clever.
What is it about David that stops you speaking?
What is it about you that bloody well makes you want to go on about him
- the whole bloody time?
- Vulgar but fluent.
- You don't stammer when you swear.
- Bugger off!
- Is that the best you can do?
- Well, bloody bugger to you, you beastly bastard.
Oh, a public school prig could do better than that.
Shit.
Shit, shit, shit.
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit!
Yes, defecation flows trippingly from the tongue.
- Because I'm angry!
- Do you know the "f" word?
- Fornication?
- Oh, Bertie.
Fuck.
Fuck!
Fuck, fuck, fuckin' fuck!
Fuck, fuck and bugger!
Bugger, bugger, buggedy, fuck!
- Fuck, ass!
- Yes!
- Balls, balls, fuckety shit.
- You see?
Not a hesitation.
Willy, shit and fuck!
And tits.
- Dad, what's going on?
- Sorry.
Just finish your homework.
Well, that's a side of you we don't get to see all that often.
No.
No, we're not supposed to, really.
Not publicly.
- Let's get some air.
- No, I don't think that's a good idea.
What's the matter?
Why are you so upset?
Logue, you have no idea.
My... my brother is infatuated with a woman who's been married twice.
She's asking for a divorce, and he's determined to marry her.
- Jesus.
- Mrs. Wallis Simpson...
- ...of Baltimore.
- That's not right.
- Queen Wallis of Baltimore.
- Unthinkable.
- Can he do it?
- Absolutely not.
But he's going to anyway.
All hell's broken loose.
- Can't they just carry on privately?
- If only they would.
Where does this leave you?
I know my place.
I...
I...
I will do anything in my power to keep my brother on the throne.
Is it that serious?
- Your place may well be on the throne.
- I am not an alternative to my brother.
- You can outshine David.
- Don't take liberties!
- That's bordering on treason.
- I'm just saying you could be King.
- You could do it.
- That is treason.
I'm trying to get you to realize you needn't be governed by fear.
I've had enough of this.
- What are you so afraid of?
- Your poisonous words!
Why did you come to me?
You're not some middle-class banker who wants elocution lessons so you can chitchat...
Don't attempt to instruct me on my duties!
I am the son of a...
King.
And the brother of... of a King.
You're the disappointing son of a brewer.
A jumped-up jackeroo from the outback.
You're a nobody.
These sessions are over.
Through here, sir.
It's not because she's an American.
That is the least of it.
It's because she's a soon to be twice divorced American.
And the King, as head of the Church of England, cannot marry a divorced woman.
And, sir, I apologize for the nature of this.
According to Scotland Yard, the King has not always possessed exclusive rights to Mrs. Simpson's...
favors and affections sharing them with a married used car salesman, a certain Mr. Guy Trundle.
In addition, it is also rumoured Hitler's ambassador,
Count von Ribbentrop, sends her 17 carnations every day.
Should His Majesty continue to ignore the advice of his government, he must abdicate.
Otherwise, his government has no choice but to resign.
Prime Minister, you'd leave a country without a a government?
Does the King do what he wants?
Or does he do what the people expect him to do?
As crowds in Downing Street watch ministers come and go, there is raised an age-old problem:
Can a king separate his personal life
- from his public duty...
- What's the matter, love?
I'm just having trouble with a patient.
That isn't like you.
- Why?
- He's scared.
He's afraid of his own shadow.
Isn't that why they come to you?
This fellow could really be somebody great.
He's fighting me.
Perhaps he doesn't want to be great.
Perhaps that's what you want.
I might have overstepped the mark.
Apologize.
Do you both good.
I'm very sorry, Mr. Logue, the Duke is busy.
I'm happy to wait.
Or I could come back later.
As I said, the Duke is terribly busy.
Thank you.
Parliament will not support the marriage.
But there are other reasons for concern.
He was careless with state papers.
He lacked commitment and resolve, and there are those who are worried about where he will stand when war comes with Germany.
- We're not coming to that?
- Indeed we are, sir.
Prime Minister Baldwin may deny this, but Hitler's intent is crystal clear.
War with Germany will come.
And we will need a King whom we can all stand behind, united.
I fear my brother is not of sound mind at this time.
Have you thought what you will call yourself?
Hmm?
Certainly not Albert, sir.
Too Germanic.
What about George?
After your father?
George the Sixth has a rather nice continuity to it.
Don't you think?
David.
Thank God.
You look exhausted.
How are you bearing up?
Bertie, the decision's been made.
I...
I'm going.
- I can't accept that...
- I'm afraid there's no other way.
I must marry her.
My mind's made up.
I'm... sorry.
That's a terrible thing to hear.
Nobody wants that.
I, least of all.
At long last,
I am able to say a few words of my own.
I have never wanted to withhold anything, but until now it has not been constitutionally possible for me to speak.
A few hours ago, I discharged my last duty as King and Emperor, and now that I have been succeeded by my brother, the Duke of York, my first words must be to declare my allegiance to him.
This I do with all my heart.
You all know the reasons which have impelled me to renounce the throne, but you must believe me when I tell you that I have found it impossible to carry the heavy burden
Of responsibility and to discharge my duties as King, as I would wish to do without the help and support of the woman I love.
And I want you to know, this decision has been made less difficult to me by the sure knowledge that my brother, with his long training in the public affairs of this country, and with his fine qualities,
will be able to take my place forthwith without interruption or injury to the life and progress of the Empire.
I meet you today in in circumstances which are...
- I'm sure you'll love it.
- There you go.
Thank you, darling.
Saddles.
Margaret.
- There's Montezuma.
- Oh, here's one.
- Mama, here's a horse and saddle.
- Thank you.
Oops.
- Don't worry, Sally.
We'll get you...
- Mama?
- Yes?
- Will we have space for our horses...
- ...in our new home?
- Course we will, darling.
We'll have a palace of rooms.
Curtsey.
Your Majesty.
How was it?
I was trying to...
familiarize myself with... what a state paper looks like.
It's a dispatch from Mr. Baldwin, which I don't understand a word of.
David's finances.
Christmas... broadcast.
- Think that would be a mistake.
- No, don't worry about that.
Oh.
Plans for the Coronation.
Think that would be an even bigger mistake.
- I'm not a King.
- Oh, shush.
I'm a Naval officer.
That's all I know.
I'm not a King.
I'm not a King.
- I'm sorry.
- No.
- I'm sorry.
- No, don't be silly.
Please.
Oh, my dear.
My dear, dear man.
- I'm sorry.
- You know,
I refused your first two marriage proposals, not because I didn't love you, but because I couldn't bear the idea of a Royal life.
Couldn't bear the idea of a life of tours, public duty, of...
Well, a life that no longer was really to be my own.
But then I thought, he stammers so beautifully, they'll leave us alone.
Waiting for a King to apologize, one can wait rather a long wait.
I'm afraid we're slightly late.
This is home.
Myrtle's at bridge.
I made sure the boys were out.
It's lovely.
Absolutely lovely.
- Oh!
May I sit down?
- Yes, of course.
- Would you like some tea, ma'am?
- Yes, I'll help myself.
Now, off you go.
Or must I knock your heads together?
Here's your shilling.
I...
I understand what you were trying to say, Logue.
I went about it the wrong way.
I'm sorry.
So, here I am.
Is the nation ready for two...
minutes of radio silence?
Every stammerer always fears going back to square one.
I don't let that happen.
If I fail in my duty,
David could come back.
I've seen the placards.
"God save our...
King."
They don't mean me.
Every monarch in history has succeeded someone who's dead
Or just about to be.
My predecessor is not only alive, but very much so.
It's a bloody mess.
Couldn't even give them a Christmas speech.
- Like your dad used to do?
- Precisely.
He's not here anymore.
Yes, he is.
He's on that shilling I gave you.
Easy enough to give away.
You don't have to carry him around in your pocket.
Or your brother.
You don't need to be afraid of the things you were afraid of when you were five.
You're very much your own man, Bertie.
Am I?
- Your face is next, mate.
- Lionel, dear!
Myrtle.
- Is this your wife?
- Yes.
Bertie.
Come here.
- Are you all right, Logue?
- Yes.
- Shouldn't we go through?
- Trust me, it's important.
- What is it?
- Oh!
- You're...
- It's "Your Majesty" the first time.
After that, it's "Ma'am." As in "ham."
Not "malm" as in "palm."
I haven't told her about us.
Sit down, relax.
I'm told your husband calls my husband Bertie.
And my husband calls your husband Lionel.
I trust you won't call me Liz.
Your Majesty, you may call me Mrs. Logue, ma'am.
Very nice to meet you, Mrs. Logue.
- Logue, we can't stay here all day.
- Yes, we can.
- Logue!
- I need to wait for the right moment.
- Logue, you're being a coward.
- You're damn right.
Get out there, man.
Hello, Myrtle, darling.
You're early.
I believe you two have met, but I don't think you know king George the Sixth.
- It's very nice to meet you.
Will Their Majesties be staying to dinner?
We'd love to, such a treat, but alas a previous engagement.
What a pity.
- Archbishop.
- Welcome, Your Majesty.
What a glorious transformation, sir.
I hope you'll forgive us if we continue our preparations?
Now, allow me to guide you through the ceremony.
We begin, of course, at the West door into the nave.
I see all your pronouncements are to be broadcast, Archbishop.
Ah, yes.
Wireless.
It is, indeed, a Pandora's box, and I'm afraid I've also had to permit the newsreel cameras.
The product of which I shall personally edit.
Without momentary hesitations.
This is Dr. Logue of Harley Street.
He's... my speech therapist.
- Your Grace.
- Had I known that Your Majesty was seeking assistance, I should have made my own recommendation.
Dr. Logue will will be attending the Coronation.
Of course I'll speak to the Dean, but it will be extremely difficult.
I should like the doctor to be seated in the King's Box.
But members of your family will be seated there, sir.
That is why it is suitable.
And now, if you don't mind, Your Grace, we need the premises.
My dear fellow, this is Westminster Abbey.
The Church must prepare His Majesty.
My preparations are equally as important.
With complete privacy, if you don't mind.
Those are my wishes, Your Grace.
I will place the Abbey at Your Majesty's disposal, this evening.
Your Majesty.
I can't believe I'm walking on Chaucer and Handel and Dickens.
Everything all right?
Let's get cracking.
I'm not here to rehearse, Dr. Logue.
Call me Lionel.
True, you... never called yourself Doctor.
I did that for you.
No training.
No diploma, no qualifications.
Just... a great deal of nerve.
The Star Chamber inquisition, is it?
You asked for trust.
And... total equality.
Bertie, I heard you at Wembley.
I was there.
My son Laurie said, "Dad, do you think you could help that poor man?"
- What, as a failed actor?
- It's true.
I'm not a doctor.
And yes, I acted, a bit.
Well, I recited in pubs.
I taught elocution in schools.
When the Great War came, all our soldiers were returning to Australia from the front, a lot of them shell-shocked, unable to speak.
Somebody said, Lionel, "You're very good at this speech stuff.
Do you think you could possibly help these poor buggers?"
I did muscle therapy, exercises, relaxation, but I knew I had to go deeper.
Those poor young blokes had cried out in fear.
No one was listening to them.
My job was to give them faith in their own voice, and let them know that a friend was listening.
That must ring a few bells with you, Bertie.
You give a very noble account of yourself.
- Make inquiries.
It's all true.
- Inquiries have been made.
You have no idea who I have breathing down my neck.
I vouched for you, and you have no...
- ...credentials.
- But lots of success.
I can't show you a certificate.
There was no training then.
Everything I know, I know from experience.
And that war was some experience.
My plaque says, "L. Logue, Speech Defects."
Not "Doctor." There are no letters after my name.
- Lock me in the Tower.
- I would if I could.
- On what charge?
- Fraud.
With war looming, you've saddled this nation with a voiceless King.
You've destroyed the happiness of my family, all for the sake of ensnaring a star... patient you couldn't possibly hope to assist.
It'll be like mad King George the Third.
I'll be...
Mad King George the Stammerer who let his people down so badly in their hour of need.
What are you doing?
Get up!
You can't sit there!
Get up!
- Why not?
It's a chair.
- No, it...
That is not a chair!
That is...
That...
- That is Saint Edward's chair.
- People have carved their names on it.
That chair is the seat on which every King...
- It's held in place by a large rock.
- That is the Stone of Scone!
- You are trivializing everything.
- I don't care how many royal assholes
- ...have sat on this chair.
- Listen to me!
Listen to me!
- Listen to you?
By what right?
- By Divine Right, if you must.
- I am your King!
- No, you're not.
You told me so yourself.
You said you didn't want it.
Why should I waste my time listening to you?
Because I have a right to be heard!
I have a voice!
Yes, you do.
You have such perseverance, Bertie.
You're the bravest man I know.
You'll make a bloody good King.
- What on earth is going on, sir?
- It's quite all right, Archbishop.
Mr. Logue, you must know that
I've found a replacement English specialist with impeccable credentials.
Hence, your services will no longer be required.
- I'm sorry?
- Your Majesty's function is to consult and be advised.
Now, you didn't consult,
- ...but you have just been advised.
- And now I advise you.
In this personal matter, I will make my own decision.
My concern is for the head on which I must place the crown.
I appreciate that, Archbishop.
But it's my head.
Your humble servant.
Thank you, Bertie.
Shall we rehearse?
Come on.
Up on your perch.
Now, when you and Elizabeth enter through the West door, you will be greeted by the hymn "I was glad when they said unto me."
Actually, you won't be that glad because they do sing it for a very long time.
Then your friend, the Archbishop, will ponce up the stairs towards you, and say, "Sir, is Your Majesty willing to take the oath?"
- "I am willing."
- Well, of course you are.
I'm gonna see what this sounds like in the cheap seats, so even your old nanny can hear.
"Will you govern your peoples, Great Britain, Ireland, Canada,
Australia and New Zealand, according to their lands and customs?"
- "I SOLEMNLY PROMISE TO DO SO!"
- Louder.
- I can't hear you up the back.
- "I solemnly promise to do so."
Very good. "And will you, to your power, cause Law and Justice, in Mercy to be executed in all your judgments?"
"I will. "I WILL!"
Then there's a very long bit about upholding the faith.
It goes on, rubbish, rubbish, rubbish, to which you finally say...
"The things which I have...
here before promised,
I will perform and keep.
So help me God."
And that's all you say.
Four short responses.
Kiss the book, sign the oath, and you're King.
Easy.
You nearly crowned him backwards, Archbishop.
Someone had removed the thread marking the back of the crown, sir.
Try not to lose the thread, Archbishop.
Archbishop, we're missing Papa.
- God save the King.
- Very good.
Very good, Archbishop.
Well, I hope Your Majesties are thrilled with the result.
- You can switch that machine off.
- No, wait.
Keep going.
- Nazism has held its great convention.
- Do take a seat, Archbishop.
Masses of uniformed men, stupefying to the eye, and incredible to the imagination have stood in spellbound audience of the Fuhrer.
- Papao Papa, what's he saying?
- Hmm?
I don't know, but he seems to be saying it rather well.
Sir...
I have asked to see you today in order to tender my resignation as Prime Minister.
I'm so sorry to hear that, Mr. Baldwin.
Neville Chamberlain will take my place as Prime Minister.
It's a matter of principle.
I was mistaken.
I have found it impossible to believe that there is any man in the world so lacking in moral feeling as Hitler, that the world may be hurled for a second time into the abyss of destructive war.
Churchill was right all along.
This was always Hitler's intention.
I'm only very sorry to leave you at this great time of crisis.
I'm very much afraid, sir, that your greatest test is yet to come.
I am speaking to you from the Cabinet room at 10 Downing Street.
This morning, the British ambassador in Berlin handed the German government a final note stating that unless we heard from them by 11:00, that they were prepared at once to withdraw their troops from Poland, ...a state of war would exist between us.
I have to tell you now that no such undertaking has been received, and that, consequently, this country is at war with Germany.
At last, sir, here is your speech.
You are on air at six.
I have timed it to just under nine minutes.
The wording is fully approved.
The Prime Minister will be joining you for the broadcast, which will go out live across the nation, the Empire
- ...and to our armed forces.
- Get Logue here immediately.
- There's the barrage balloons.
- Yes.
- They got them up there quickly.
- Yeah.
- Hold it!
Hold it!
- Shall we pull over and find a shelter?
- No, no.
Go straight there.
We'll be all right.
- Yes, sir?
- Lionel Logue.
Major Hartley is expecting me.
This is my son, Laurie.
- Thank you, Laurie.
- Good luck, Dad.
- The King's speech.
- Thank you, sir.
We have about 40 minutes to the broadcast.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
There may be dark days ahead and...
- Try again.
There may be dark days ahead, and...
Turn the hesitations into pauses and say to yourself, "God save the King."
I say that continuously, but apparently no one's listening.
Long pauses are good.
They add solemnity to great occasions.
Then I'm the solemnest king who ever lived.
You know, if I'm a king, where's my power?
Can I... can I form a government?
Can I... can I...
levy a tax?
Declare a... a war?
No.
And yet I'm the seat of all authority.
Why?
Because the nation believes that when I...
I speak,
I speak for them.
But I can't speak.
Let's take it all again from the top.
"In this grave hour."
In this grave hour...
Fuck, fuck, fuck.
Perhaps the most fateful in our history...
Bugger, shit, shit.
I send to every household of my...
You see, "P" is always difficult, even when I'm singing.
Bounce on to it. "A peoples."
A people.
A people.
Household of my peoples, both at home
- ...and overseas.
- Beautiful.
This message...
Doo-dah
Spoken with the same depth of feeling, Doo-dah day, ...for each one of you, as if I were able to...
Shit, fuck, bugger!
...cross your threshold and speak to you...
In your head now. "I have a right to be bloody well heard."
Bloody well heard, bloody well heard myself!
Now, waltz.
Move.
Get continuous movement.
"For the second time in the lives of most of us...
- "We are at..." - "We are," take a pause.
- Lionel, I can't do this.
- Bertie, you can do it.
- Have a look at the last paragraph.
- Bertie.
It's time.
There he is.
- Archbishop.
- Your Majesty.
A great moment, Sir.
- Prime Minister.
- Your Majesty.
Nice to see you... again so soon.
Good of you to be here.
I'm sure you have had...
- ...a rather busy day.
- I hope we have no more interruptions...
- ...from those damn sirens, sir.
- Or the wretched dogs.
Congrat...
Congratulations.
- First Lord of the Admiralty.
- Your Majesty.
The long... walk.
Good luck, sir.
I, too, dread this apparatus.
Had a speech impediment myself, you know.
- I didn't.
- Family secret.
Tongue-tied.
An operation was considered to be too dangerous.
I eventually made an asset of it.
- Thank you, Mr. Churchill.
- Sir.
Darling.
- How long, Logue?
- Just under three minutes.
- Mr. Wood.
- Good luck, Your Majesty.
Mr. Wood.
- You've redecorated, Logue.
- I made it cosy.
- Some fresh air.
- There you are, darling.
I'm a thistle-sifter.
I've a sieve of sifted thistles and a sieve of unsifted thistles.
A sieve of sifted thistles and a sieve of unsifted thistles.
- Because I'm...
- Bertie.
Darling.
Make sure it's not switched on.
Remember, the red light will blink four times, then I've asked them to turn it off.
'Cause we don't want that evil eye staring at you all the way through.
One minute, sir.
I'm sure you'll be splendid.
Forty seconds, sir.
Logue.
However this turns out I don't know how to thank you...
for what you've done.
Knighthood?
Twenty seconds.
Forget everything else, and just say it to me.
Say it to me as a friend.
In this grave hour perhaps the most fateful in our history I send to every household of my a- peoples both at home and overseas...
...this message spoken with the same depth of feeling for each one of you as if I were able to cross your threshold and speak to you... myself.
For the second time in the lives of most of us we are... at...
Fuck, fuck, fuck!
...at war.
Very good.
Over and over again we have tried to find a peaceful way out of the differences between ourselves and those who are now our... enemies.
But it has been... in vain.
We have been forced into a conflict, for we are called to meet the challenge of a principle, which, if it were to prevail, would be fatal to any civilized order in the world.
Such a principle, stripped of all disguise, is surely the mere primitive doctrine that might is right.
For the sake of all that we ourselves hold dear, it is unthinkable that we should refuse to meet the challenge.
It is to this high purpose that I now call my people at home, and my peoples across the seas, who will make our cause their own.
I ask them to stand calm and firm and united in this time of trial.
The task will be hard.
There may be dark days ahead, and war can no longer be confined to the battlefield.
But we can only do the right as we see the right, and reverently commit
Our cause to God.
If one and all we keep resolutely faithful to it, then, with God's help, we shall... prevail.
[a sigh of relief]
It was very good, Bertie.
You still stammered on the "W."
Well, I had to throw in a few, so they knew it was me.
Congratulations, Your Majesty.
A true broadcaster.
Thank you, Mr. Wood.
- Congratulations, Your Majesty.
- Sir.
- Congratulations, Your Majesty.
- Thank you.
Ready.
- Good?
- Perfect, sir.
Your first wartime speech.
Congratulations.
I expect I shall have to...
do a great deal more.
Thank you, Logue.
Well done.
My friend.
Thank you Your Majesty.
I knew you'd be good.
Thank you...
Lionel.
Onwards.
- Congratulations, sir.
- Well done, sir.
Couldn't have said it better myself, sir.
Your Majesty, I am speechless.
- Congratulations, sir.
- Gentlemen.
- So how was Papa, Elizabeth?
- Halting at first,
- But you got much better, Papa.
- Well, bless you.
- And how about you, Margaret?
- You were just splendid, Papa.
Of course I was.
Are we all ready?
Come on, girls.
You are live in two minutes, Your Royal Highness.
Sir?
At the microphone, Do your work Sir.
I am sure you will be splendid.
Just take your time.
Time to go.
BBC NEWS READER :
Good afternoon.
This is the BBC National Programme and Empire Services taking you to Wembley Stadium for the Closing Ceremony of the Empire Exhibition.
where His Royal Highness the Duke of York will read a message from His Father;
His Majesty, King George V.
58 British Colonies and Dominions have taken part, making this the largest Exhibition staged anywhere in the world.
Remember Sir, Three flashes;
then steady 'red' means you are Live.
BBC NEWS READER :
Using the new invention of radio,
The Opening Ceremony was the first time his Majesty the King addressed his subjects on the wireless.
At the close of the first Season,
The heir to the throne His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales, made his first broadcast.
And today, his younger brother His Royal Highness, the Duke of York will give his inaugural broadcast to the Nation and the World.
I have received... from his Majesty....t' ek
...The King.
SIR BLANDINE-BENTHAM:
Inhale deep into your lungs..
Your Royal Highness.
Relaxes your larynx, does it not?
Cigarette smoking calms the nerves and gives you confidence.
If Your Highness will be very kind as to open your hand...
It's Sterilized.
Now..
Now...if I may take the liberty?
...insert some into your mouth.
Excuse me, Doctor.
What is the purpose of this?
The classic approach, it cured Demosthenes.
That was in Ancient Greece...uh
Has it worked since?
Now, if you would be so kind as to read...
A wealth of words.
Fight against those marbles, Your Royal Highness.
Enunciate!
A little more concentration your Royal Higness.
I nearly swallowed the bloody things!
Thank you so much, Doctor, it's been most...hmm interesting.
Insert marbles!
He can insert his own bloody marbles....!
Tick, tock, tick, tock.
You know, you can't keep doing this, Bertie.
I know.
Promise me:
no more.
Hello.
Is anyone there?
I'm just in the loo.
Ah, Mrs.Johnson There you are.
I'm sorry, there's no receptionist.
I like to keep things simple.
"Poor and content is rich and rich enough"
- Sorry?
- Shakespeare.
How are you?
How do you do?
Coughing a lot.
Now, this is slightly awkward, But..
I'm afraid you're late.
Yes, I'm afraid I am.
Where's Mr Johnson?
He doesn't know I'm here.
That's not a promising start.
My husband has seen everyone to no avail.
Awefully 'fraid he's given up hope.
He hasn't seen me.
You're awfully sure of yourself.
Well, I'm sure of anyone who wants to be cured.
Of course, he wishes to be cured.
My husband is umm..
he's required to speak publicly.
Perhaps he should change jobs?
- He can't.
Indentured servitude?
Something of that nature.
Well we need to have your hubby pop by...
Uh..
Tuesday would be good...
He can give me his personal details and I'll make a frank appraisal and then, We can take it from there.
Doctor, forgive me.
I do not have a "hubby".
We don't 'pop'.
and nor do we ever talk about our private lives.
You...
must come to us.
I'm Sorry, Mrs Johnson, my game, my turf, my rules.
You'll have to talk over this with your hauband and then you can speak to me on the telephone.
Thank you very much for dropping by...
Good afternoon.
And what if my husband were the Duke of York?
The Duke of York?
Yes...
the Duke of York.
I thought the appointment was for "Johnson"?
Forgive me, your ...?
- ..
Royal Highness.
Johnson was used during the Great War;
when the Navy didn't want the enemy to know 'he' was aboard.
- Am I...considered the enemy?
You will be, if you remain un- obliging.
Of course.
How did you find me, Your Royal Highness?
The President of the Speech Therapists Society.
Eileen McCleod?
She's a sport.
Dr McCleod warned me your antipodean methods were "unorthodox and controversial".
I warned her...
those were not my favorite words.
I can cure your husband.
But for my method to work I need trust and total equality;
Here, in the safety of my consultation room.
No exceptions.
Well then, in that case...
When can you start?
Still sounds a bit rough, mate.
You make me drive too slowly, Dad!
Did you pick mum up from Bridge?
Yes, I've hardly been out of the car all day.
I had a special visitor this afternoon.
- May I please leave this table
- How special, special?
No, You must stay, bored stupid, listening to your parents' inane conversation.
- Thanks Dad..
- and Mum.
- Me too.
- You meeting Jean?
- No, someone else.
Doctor?
Doctor?
Can't you help your brother with the washing...
I'm fine.
Who's it Lionel?
Why bring it up if you can't talk about it?
Myrtle, It's just a woman, looking to help her husband.
Oh!
And I had a 'call'.
for an audition.
One of my favorites.
- Aren't they all?
It Could be a lot of fun.
I'm sure you'll be splendid.
They're a highly regarded group.
From Putney.
Tomorrow, Chapter IV.
'The Flight'.
Oh, to fly away!
Weren't they lucky!
Now Papa tell a story!
- Could I be a penguin instead?
Once, there were two princesses...
Princess Elizabeth and Princess Margaret.
whose Papa was a penguin.
This was because he had been turned into one by the wicket witch.
This was an...
inconvenient for him..
because he loved to hold his princesses in his arms... and you can't because he don't have wings like herrings
- Herrings don't have wings.
- Penguins have wings which is shaped like herrings and make matters worse... is that she sent him to the South Pole.
which is an awfully long walk..back.
if you can't fly.
So..
When he reached the water, he dived in through the dept so fast... that he was in Southampton waters by lunchtime.
And from there, he took the 2.30 to Weybridge, changed at Clapham Junction and asked a passing Mallard the way to Buckingham Palace.
He swam up the Thames, out through the plughole, and gave the cook,
Mama and ...
Mrs Whittaker quite a shock.
Now when the girls heard all the commotions, they ran to the kitchen where they gave him a good scrub, a mackerel and a kiss.
and as they kissed him, guess what he turned into?
- A handsome prince.
A short-tailed Albatross.
With wings so big that he could wrap them both his two girls together.
Now, now..
It's time for bed.
Will Mrs Simpson be there?
- My brother's insisting.
- Is he serious?
- About her coming to dinner?
- No.
About her!
- A married woman?
He can't be.
- She can.
By the way,
I think I found someone rather interesting.
On Harley Street.
A doctor.
- Out of the question.
I'm not having this conversation again.
The matter's settled.
- His approach seems rather different....
Now?
Now.
"Now is the winter of our discontent,
Made glorious summer by this sun of York".
"And all the clouds that lour'd upon our house
In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.
Now are our brows, bound with victorious... wreaths;
- Thank you!
Lovely diction Mr...?
- Logue.
Lionel Logue.
- Well, Mr.Logue.
I'm not hearing the cries of a deformed creature yearning to be King.
Nor did I realize Richard the Third was King of the Colonies.
I do know the lines.
I've played the role before.
- Sydney?
- Perth.
- Major theater town, is it?
-Enthusiastic.
- Ah.
- I was well reviewed.
Yes...
well...
Lionel,
I think our dramatic society, is looking for someone slightly younger and a... little more regal.
Where did you find this...physician?
Classifieds, next to "French model, Shepherd's Market".
He comes highly recommended.
Charges substantial fees in order to help the poor.
Oh dear, perhaps he's a Bolshevik?
!
No receptionist.
He likes to keep things simple.
- The Johnsons.
You can go in now, "Mr. Johnson".
Lionel says... wait here if you wish, Mrs Johnson.
Or, it being a p- pleasant day, p-perhaps take a stroll.
Was that alright...
Lionel?
Marvellous!
Willy.
You can stay and wait for your mom.
Mrs Johnson...
Mr Johnson, Do come in.
He's a good lad, Willy.
He could hardly make a sound, you know, when he first came to me.
My boys made those.
Good, aren't they?
Please make yourself comfortable.
I was told not to sit too close.
Well I believe when speaking with a Prince,
One waits for the prince to choose a topic.
Waiting for me to...
commence a conversation ..
one can wait a rather long wait.
Do you Know any jokes?
Timing isn't my strong suit.
Cuppa tea?
No thank you.
Aren't you going to start treating me Dr Logue?
Only if you're interested in being treated.
Please, call me Lionel.
I prefer Doctor.
I prefer Lionel.
What'll I call you?
Your Royal Highness, then Sir after that.
A bit formal for here.
What about your name?
Prince Albert ...
Frederick Arthur George?
How about Bertie?
Only my family uses that.
Perfect.
In here, it's better if we're equals.
If we were equal I wouldn't be here.
I'd be at home with my wife and no-one would give a damn.
Please, Don't do that.
I'm sorry?
I believe, Sucking smoke into your lungs will kill you.
My physicians say it relaxes the throat.
They're idiots.
They've all been knighted.
Makes it official then.
My 'castle', my rules.
What was your earliest memory?
What?
an earth do you mean?
Your First recollection.
I'm not... here to discuss my personal matters.
Why're you here then?
Because I bloody well stammer!
You have a bit of a temper?
One of my many faults.
When did the defect start?
I've always been this way!
I doubt that.
Don't tell me!
It's my stammer!
- Its my field.
I can assure you, no infant starts to speak with a stammer.
When did yours start?
four or five.
That's typical.
So I've been told.
I can't remember not doing it.
I can believe that.
Do you hesitate when you think?
Don't be ridiculous.
How about when you talk to yourself?
Everyone natters occasionally Bertie.
Stop calling me that!
I'm not going to call you anything else.
Then we shan't speak!
Are you charging for this, Doctor?
A fortune.
So, when you talk to yourself, do you stammer?
Of course not!
Well, that proves your impediment isn't a permanent part of you.
What do you think was the cause?
I don't know.
I don't care!
I stammer!
And no one can fix it.
I Bet you, you can read flawlessly, right here, right now.
And if I win, I get to ask questions.
- And if I win?
- You don't have to answer.
One usually ...
wagers money.
A bob each to sweeten it?
Lets See your shilling?
- I don't...
carry money.
- I had a funny feeling you mightn't.
I'll stake you.
You can Pay me back next time.
- Who says there is a next time?
- I haven't agreed to take you on, yet.
Please stand.
and take a look at that...
I can't read this.
Then you owe me a shilling , for not trying.
"To be...
or not to be,....
That...
I can't read!
I haven't finished yet.
I'm going to record your voice and then play it back to you on the same machine.
This is brilliant.
It's the latest thing from America:
its a Silvertone.
Pop this on?
There's a bob in this, mate.
You can go home rich!
- You're playing music.
- I know.
How can I hear what I'm saying?
!
Surely a Prince's brain knows what its mouth is doing?
You're not well acquainted with Royal Princes, are you?
Hopeless.
Hopeless!
You were sublime.
Would I lie to a prince of the realm to win twelve-pence?
I've no idea what an Australian might do for that sort of money.
Let me play it back to you.
No.
All right then, I get to ask you the question.
Thank you Doctor,
I don't feel..
this is for me.
Thank You for your time, Bye.
- Sir?
the recording is free.
Please..
keep it as a souvenir.
KING GEORGE V (O.S.) For the present, the work to which we are all equally bound, is to arrive at a reasoned tranquillity within our borders, to regain prosperity in this time of depression without self-seeking
and to carry with us those whom the burden of past years has disheartened or overborne.
To all, to each,
I wish a Happy Christmas.
God bless you.
Easy when you know how.
Have a go yourself.
Congratulations, Sir.
Ah, Mr Wood.
Splendid fellow.
Chap taught me everything I know:
let the microphone do the work.
Sit up, straight back, face boldly up to the bloody thing and stare it square in the eye, as you would any decent Englishman.
Show who's in command.
Papa, I D-d-don't thu-thu-think I c-c-can read this.
- This devilish device will change everything if you don't.
In the past all a King had to do was look respectable in uniform and not fall off his horse.
Now we must invade people's homes and ingratiate ourselves with them.
This family is reduced to those lowest, basest of all creatures... we've become...actors!
- we're not a family, we're a firm.
- Yet at any moment, some of us may be out of work.
Your darling brother, and future king!
The only wife he appears interested in is invariably the wife of another!
- He's broken off with Lady Furness.
And taken up a Mrs Simpson, a woman with two husbands living!
I told him straight, no divorced person could ever be received at court.
He said, "It made him sublimely happy."
I imagined that was because she was sleeping with him.
"I give you my word..' this is what he said.
"I give you my word we've never had immoral relations,"
Stared square into his father's eyes...
and lied!
When I'm dead that boy will ruin himself, this family, and this nation, within twelve months.
Who'll pick up the pieces?
Herr Hitler, intimidating half of Europe, Marshall Stalin the other half?
Who'll stand between us, the jackboots, and the proletarian abyss?
You?
With your older brother shirking his duties, you're going to have to do a lot more of this.
Have a go yourself.
Son.
Get it out boy!
...m-marvels of m-
- Modern... just take your time - form your words carefully
Science, I am enabled, this ...
- Relax!
Just try it!
Do it!
Lying ..
bastard.
"To be, or not to be, - that is the question: -
"...whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles, And by opposing end them.."
"..to die...
to sleep; no more.."
Strictly business.
No p..
personal nonsense.
I thought I'd made that very clear in our interview.
- Got the shilling you owe me?
- No I haven't!
- Didn't think so.
Besides, you tricked me!
Physical excercises and tricks are important...
What you're asking will only deal with the surface of the problem.
That's sufficient.
As far as i see it, My hausband... has mechanical difficulties with his speech.
Maybe...
Just deal with that.
- I'm willing to work hard, Doctor Logue...
- Lionel.
- Are you..
are you willing to do your part?
Alright.
You want mechanics?
We need to relax your throat muscles and strengthen your tongue.
By repeating tongue twisters for example.
"I am a thistle-sifter.
I have a sieve of sifted thistles and a sieve of unsifted thistles.
Because I am a thistle sifter."
- Fine!
You have a flabby tummy, we must build up the strength in your diaphragm.
Simple mechanics.
That is all we ask.
And that's about a shilling's worth.
Forget about the blessed shilling!
Perhaps, upon occasion, you might be requested some assistance in cope with a minor event.
Will that agreeable?
Of course.
That will be the full extent of your services.
- Shall I see you next week?
- I shall see you every day.
Ahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahah.
Feel the loosening of the jaw
Take a nice deep breath.
Expand your chest..
How do you feel?
full of hot air.
- Isn't that what public speaking is all about?
Are you alright, Bertie?
This is actually quite good fun,
- Hello, Bertie.
- Hello David.
Where've you been?
Been busy.
- So was I.
Elizabeth has pneumonia.
I'm sorry.
She'll recover.
Father won't.
- I'll drive.
Old bugger's doing this on purpose.
Dying?
Departing prematurely...
to complicate matters.
Oh for heaven's sake, David.
You know how long he's been ill.
Wallis explained.
She's terribly clever about this thing.
LORD WIGRAM:
... whereas by letters patent underthe Great Seal, bearing date of Westminster, the eleventh June 1912 his Majesty King George V did constitute, order and declare that there should be a guardian,
Custos Regni, in the form of Councillors of State
It's the order of the Council for the State, Sir.
So we may act on your behalf.
I'm still confused...
Approved.
Thank you.
Feeling a little better Sir?
No.
I'm not feeling any better.
I feel dreadful.
Have you been ice skating?
..Ice skating.
No, George.
...I know, darling, a talk, even a lovely long talk, is a poor substitute for holding tight and making drowsy.
Nor making our own drowsies either, as we've had to dofar too often lately.
David, Dinner?
- I'm on with Wallis!
Wallis misses me terribly.
- Mama says you're late for dinner.
- She forgets Papa's bloody clocks were always half an hour fast!
How is the king?
I hope he is not in pain.
No, no, His Majesty, he's quieter now.
Thank you.
David, If your father were well, tardiness would not be tolerated.
None of this..
unpleasantness would be tolerated
You know Sir, I appreciate that yo are different from your father in your outlook and temperament.
I want you to know that whenever the King questioned your conduct,
I tried in your interest, to present it in a most favourable light.
I can always trust you to have my best interests at heart.
I fear, our vigil will not be of long duration.
Please, continue.
We commend our brother George to the mercy of God, our Maker and Redeemer.
Long live the King.
I hope, I will make good as he has made good.
What on earth was that?
Poor Wallis.
Now I'm trapped!
Time for a Shake, dad?
You sure?
Go on.
Put your thinking caps on.
Bet its the Scottish Play.
No, I bet it's Othello.
It's always Othello.
"Art thou afeard?"
Caliban!
Oh!
For heaven's sake.. that was a lucky guess!
Don't listen to egghead.
Go on, Dad.
"the isle is full ofnoises,Sounds and sweet airs, that give delight, and hurt not.
Sometimes a thousand twanging instruments Will hum about mine ears;
and sometimes voices,That, if then I had waked after long sleep,Will make me sleep again:"
Alright, clever clogs, what comes next?
"..and then, in dreaming, The clouds me thought would open,
and show riches Ready to drop upon me;
that when I'm awake..."
...when I waked, I cried to dream again."
It's such a sad thought.
My next patient must be early.
You better go lads, I'm sorry.
Won't be a moment, Clifford.
Bertie!
they told me not to expect you.
I am Sorry about your father.
I don't wish to intrude..
oh no...
course.
Please come in.
I've been practising.
One hour a day.
In spite of everything.
What's going on there?
I was, sorry, mucking around with my kids.
Do you feel like working today?
A Curtis bi-plane.
I'll put on some hot milk.
Logue, I'd kill for something stronger.
I wasn't there for my father's death.
Still makes me sad.
I can imagine so.
What did you father do?
He was a brewer.
At least there was free beer.
Here's to the memory of your father.
I was informed, after the fact... that my father's last words were:
"Bertie has more guts than the rest of his brothers put together."
He couldn't say that to my face.
My brother.
What about him?
Try singing.
I'm sorry.
Know any songs?
Songs?
Yes songs.
"Swanee River".
I love that song.
Happens to be my favorite.
Sing me the chorus.
No.
Certainly not.
Always wanted to build models.
Father wouldn't allow it.
He collected stamps.
we had to collect stamps.
You can finish that off.
If you sing.
I'm not going to sit here, wobbling.
You can with me.
Because you're peculiar.
I take that as a compliment.
I'm not crooning "Swanee River!"
Try "Camptown Races" then.
"My brother D, he said to me, doo- dah doo-dah..." Continuous sound will give you flow.
Does it feel strange, now that David's on the throne?
To tell the truth,
It was a relief...
Knowing I wouldn't be King.
But unless he produces an heir, you're next in line.
And your daughter, Elizabeth, would then succeed you.
"You're barking up the wrong tree now, Doctor, Doctor."
"Lionel" See?
You didn'stammer.
Of course I didn't stammer, I was singing!
Well, as a little reward, you get to put some glue on these struts.
Your boy, won't mind?
No, not at all.
David and I were very close.
Young bucks...
You know.
Chase the same girls?
David was always very helpful in arranging introductions.
We shared the expert ministrations of "Paulette" in Paris.
Not at the same time of course.
Did David tease you?
Yes, they all did.
"Buh-buh-buh-Bertie".
Father encouraged it. "Get it out, boy!" Said it would make me stop.
Said..."I was afraid of my father, and my children are damn well going to be afraid of me".
Are you naturally right handed?
Left.
I was punished.
Now I use the right.
Yes, that's very common with stammerers.
Anything other corrections?
Knock knees.
Metal splints were made...worn night and day.
That must have been painful.
Bloody agony.
Straight legs now.
Who were you closest to in your family?
Nannies.
Not my first nanny, though..she loved David...hated me.
When we are presented to my parents for the daily viewing, she'd pinch me..
I'd cry and be handed back to her..
immediately.
Then...
she would...
Sing it.
" then she wouldn't feed me, far far away."
Took three years for my parents to notice.
As you can imagine, it caused some stomach problems.
Still.
What about your brother Johnnie?
Were you close to him?
Johnny..
Sweet boy.
Epilepsy...and... he was 'different'.
Died at 13, hidden from view.
I've been told it's not catching.
Do you want a top-up?
Please.
You know, Lionel, you're the first ordinary Englishman...
Australian.
...I've ever really spoken to.
Sometimes, when I ride through the streets and see, you know, the Common Man staring at me,
I'm struck by how little I know of hislife, and how little he knows of mine.
Thank you.
What're friends for.
I wouldn't know.
"I sifted seven thick-stalked thistles through strong thicksieves.
I sifted seven..."
One hundred year old oaks...removed to improve the view!
Who does she think she is!
Nonetheless...we must try to be pleasant towards Mrs Simpson.
You know she calls me "The Fat Scottish Cook"?
You're not fat.
I'm getting plump.
You seldom cook.
I sifted seven.
Shut up!
Their Royal Highnesses the Duke and Duchess of York.
How lovely to see you both.
Welcome to our little country shack.
I came at the invitation of the King.
Hello David.
you're making some changes to the garden, I see yes, I am.
I am not quite finished.
Don't tell me I behaved badly, Mr Churchill.
On the contrary, your Royal Highness.
Etiquette decrees royalty must be greeted by the official host: in this case: the King.
Not a commoner.
- Thank you.
What is her hold on him?
I have no idea.
Apparently she has certain...skills, ...in an establishment in Shanghai.
David, I've been trying to see you...
I've been terribly busy.
Doing what?
Kinging.
Kinging?
is a precarious business!
These days.
Where is the Russian Tsar?
Where is Cousin Wilhelm?
You're being dreary.
Is Kinging laying off eighty staff at Sandringham and buying yet more pearls for Wallis while there ar people marching across Europe singing "The Red Flag"?
Stop your worrying.
Herr Hitler will sort that lot out.
Who'll sort out Herr Hitler?
And you've put that woman into our mother's suite?
Mother's not still in the bed, is she?
That's not funny.
Wally likes the very best.
I don't care what woman you carry on with at night, as long as you show up for duty in the morning!
Wally is not just some woman I am carrying on with.
We intend to marry.
Excuse me?
She's filing a petition for divorce.
Good God.
Can't you just give her a nice house and a title?
I won't have her as my mistress.
David, the Church does not recognise divorce and you are the head of the Church.
Haven't I any rights?
Many privileges...
Not the same thing.
Your beloved Common Man may marry for love, why not me?
If you were the Common Man, on what basis could you possibly claim to be King?
!
Sounds like you've studied our wretched constitution.
Sounds like you haven't.
Is that what this is all about?
Brushing up..
hence the elocution lessons?
I'm trying to t-t...
Yearning for a larger audience are we, B-b-b-bertie?
D-don't ...
Younger brother trying to push older brother off throne..
Pa pa..
...Positively medieval.
Where have you been all this time?
- Never you mind.
Ahh..what a complicated lovely coon you are.
- I try to be.
All that work, down the drain.
My own brother...
I couldn't say..
I couldn't say a word in reply!
Why do you stammer more with David than you do with me?
Because you're bloody well paid to listen!
Bertie, I'm not a geisha girl.
Stop trying to be so bloody clever!
What is it about David that stops you speaking?
What is it about you, that bloody makes want you to go on about it, all the time.
Vulgar but fluent.
You don't stammer when you swear.
Bugger off!
Is that the best you can do?
Well, bloody bugger to you, you beastly bastard.
A public school prig can do better than that.
Shit !
Shit, shit, shit!
shit!
See how defecation flows trippingly from the tongue?
Because I'm angry!
You Know the f-word?
Fornication?
OH Bertie.
Fuck.
Fuck, fuck, fuck!
Yes!
You see!
Not a hesitation!
Bloody, bloody, bloody!
Shit, shit, shit!
Bugger, bugger, bugger!
Fuck, fuck, fuck!
Dad?
What's going on?
Sorry.
Finish your homework
Well ..that's a side of you we don't get to see that often.
No.
No we're not supposed to really, not publicly.
Let's get some air.
No Logue, I don't think that's a good idea.
What's the matter?
What's got you so upset?
Logue, you have no idea.
My brother is infatuated with a woman who's been married twice.
She's asking for a divorce and David is determined to marry her.
Mrs Wallis Simpson of Baltimore.
That's not right.
Queen Wallis of Baltimore?
Unthinkable.
Can he do that?
Absolutely not.
But he's going to anyway.
All hell's broken loose.
- Can't they carry on privately?
- If only they would.
- Where does that leave you?
I know my place!
I'll do anything...
in my power to keep my brother on the throne.
-Is it that serious?
your place may be on the throne.
I am not an alternative to my brother.
If you had to you could outshine David...
Don't take liberties!
That's bordering on treason.
I'm just saying you could be King.
You could do it!
That is treason!
I'm trying to get you to realise you need not be governed by fear.
I've had enough of this!
What're you afraid of?
Your poisonous words!
Why'd you come to me?
You are not some middle class bugger, who needs elocution lessons so you can chit-chat...
Don't instruct me on my duties!
I'm the son of a ....
King... the brother of a king.
You're the disappointing son of a brewer!
A jumped-up jackeroo from the outback!
You're nobody.
These sessions are over!
It's not because she's an American.
That is the least of it.
It's because she is a soon to be a twice divorced American, and the King as head of The Church of England...
can not marry a divorced woman.
And Sir, I apologize for the nature of this, according to Scotland Yard, the King has not always possess exclusive..rights
to Mrs. Simpson's...
favours and affections, sharing them with a married used car salesman, a certain Mr Guy Trundle.
In addition, it is also rumoured...
Hitler's ambassador, Count von Ribbentrop, sends her 17 carnations every day.
Should your brother continue to ignore the advice of His Government, He must abdicate.
Otherwise His Government has no choice but to resign.
Prime Minister, you'd leave the country without a government?
Does the King do what he wants, or does he do what his people expect him to do?
What's the matter, love?
I'm Just having trouble with a patient.
That Isn't like you..
why?
He's scared...
He is afraid with his own shadow.
Isn't that why they come to you?
This fellow could be somebody great, and he's fighting me.
Perhaps, he doesn't want to be great.
Perhaps that's what you want.
I might have overstepped the mark.
Apologize,
Do you both good.
I'm very sorry, Mr Logue, the Duke is busy.
I'm happy to wait.
Or I could come back later.
As I said, the Duke is terribly busy.
Thank you.
The parliament will not support their marriage.
But there were other reasons for concern, Sir.
He was careless with state papers.
He lacked commitment and resolve.
There were those that worried where he would stand when war comes with Germany .
We're not coming to that?
Indeed we are, Sir.
Prime Minister Baldwin may deny this, but Hitler's intent is crystal clear.
War with Germany will come, and we will need a King behind whom we can all stand united.
I fear...my brother is not of sound mind, at this time.
Have you thought what you will call yourself?
Certainly not Albert, Sir.
Too Germanic.
What about George?
After your father?
George the sixth.
It has rather a nice continuity to it, don't you think?
David!
Thank God.
You look exhausted!
How are you bearing up?
Bertie.
The decision's been made.
I have to go.
I cannot accept that.
You are in no condition to make that decision.
I'm afraid there's no other way.
I must marry her.
My mind's made up.
I'm... sorry.
That's a terrible thing to hear.
David, nobody wants that.
I least of all.
" At long last I am able to say, a few words of my own.
I have never wanted to withhold anything, but until now, it has not been constitutionally possible for me to speak.
A few hours ago I discharged my last duty as King and Emperor.
Now that I have been succeeded by my brother, the Duke of York my first words must be to declare my allegiance to him.
This I do with all my heart.
You all know the reasons which have impelled me to renounce the throne.
But you must believe me, when I tell you
I have found it impossible to carry the heavy burden of responsibility and to discharge my duties..
as King as I would wish to do without the help and support of the woman I love...
And I want you to know,
..This decision has been made less difficult to me by the sure knowledge that my brother, with his long training in the public affairs of this country and with his fine qualities will be able to take my place forth with
without interruption or injury to the life and progress of the empire."
I meet you today... in circumstances which are -
Mama, will we have space for our horses in our new home?
Of course we will, darling, we'll have a palace of rooms.
Curtsey.
Your Majesty.
How was it?
I'm trying to familiarise myself with what a state paper looks like.
A despatch from Mr Baldwin which I don't understand a word of.
David's finances.
The Christmas broadcast -
I think that might be a mistake.
Plans for the Coronation -
I think that's an even bigger mistake.
I'm not a King.
I'm a naval officer.
Its the only thing I know.
I'm not a King.
Dear, dear man...
You know...
i refused your first two marriage proposals, not because I didn't love you, but because I couldn't bear the royal cage.
Couldn't bear the idea of a life of tours and public duties, a life that no longer was really to be my own.
But then I thought... he stammers so beautifully... they'll leave us alone.
Waiting for a king to apologize, one can wait rather a long wait.
I'm afraid we're slightly late.
This is home.
Myrtle's at bridge.
I've made sure the boys are out.
It's lovely.
Absolutely lovely.
Would you like some tea, Ma'am?
Yes.
I'll help myself.
Off you go...
Or must I knock your heads together?
Here's your shilling,
I understand... what you were tryingto say, Logue.
I went about it the wrong way.
I'm sorry.
Now here I am.
Is the nation ready for two minutes of radio silence?
Every stammerer always fears they will fall back to square one.
I don't let that happen.
If I fail in my duty...
David could come back.
I've seen the placards
"Save Our King!"
They don't mean me.
Every other monarch in history succeeded someone who was dead, or just about to be.
My predecessor is not only alive, but very much so.
What a bloody mess!
I can't even give them a Christmas Speech.
Like your Dad used to do?
Precisely.
He's not here anymore.
Yes he is.
He's on that shilling I gave you.
Easy enough to give away.
You don't have to carry him around in your pocket.
Or your brother.
You don't need to be afraid of the things as you were afraid of when you were five.
You're very much your own man, Bertie.
Am I?
Your face is next, mate.
Lionel?
Myrtle!
- Is it alright?
- Yes.
Bertie, come here.
- Are you alright, Logue?
- Yes.
- Shall we go through?
- Trust me.
It's important.
What is it?
- Your...
Your...
- It's "Your Majesty", the first time.
After that, it's "Ma'am," as in Ham, not Ma'lm as in Palm.
I haven't told her about us.
Sit down, relax.
I'm told your husband calls my husband Bertie and my husband calls your husband Lionel.
I trust you won't call me Liz.
Your Majesty, you may call me Mrs Logue, Ma'am.
Very nice to meet you, Mrs Logue.
Logue, we can't stand here all day.
Yes we can.
Look, I need to wait for the right moment.
- Logue, you're being a coward!
- You're damn right.
Get out there, man!
Hello, Myrtle darling!
You're early.
I believe you two have met!
But I didn't think, you know...
King George the Sixth.
- It's very nice to meet you.
Will their Majesties be staying to dinner?
We would love to, such a treat, but alas... a previous engagement.
What a pitty.
- Archbishop.
- Welcome, your Majesty.
What a glorious tranformation, Sir.
I hope you'll forgive us if we continue out preparations.
And now you will allow me to guide you through the ceremony.
We begin of course at the West door, then into the nave.
I see you all your pronouncements are to be broadcast, Archbishop.
Ah, yes, wireless is indeed a Pandora's Box.
I'm afraid I also have to permit the newsreel cameras.
The product of which I shall personally edit.
Without momentary hesitation.
This is Doctor Logue of Harley Street.
He's my speech therapist.
- Your Grace.
- Had I known that Your Majesty was seeking assistance
I should've made my own recommendation.
Dr. Logue... will be attending the Coronation.
Well of course I shall speak with the Dean, but it was extremely difficult.
I should like the Doctor to be seated in the King's Box.
But members of your Family will be seated there, Sir.
That is why it's suitable.
And now, if you don't mind Your Grace, we need the premises.
My dear fellow, this is Westminster Abbey!
The Church must prepare his Majesty.
My preparations are equalized in important
With complete privacy, if you don't mind.
Those are my wishes, Your Grace.
I shall place the Abbey at Your Majesty's disposal... this evening.
Your Majesty.
.
.
I can't believe I'm walking on Chaucer and Handel and Dickens.
Everything alright?
Let's get cracking.
I'm not here to rehearse, Doctor Logue.
Call me Lionel.
True, you... never...
called yourself "Doctor."
I did that... for you.
No training, no... diploma, no... qualifications.
Just a... great deal of nerve.
The star chamber inquisition, is this?
You asked trust and... total equality.
Bertie, I heard you at Wembley.
I was there.
My son Laurie said "Dad, do you think you could help that poor man?"
What, as a failed actor!
?
It's true, I'm not a doctor, and yes I acted a bit,
Well I recited in pubs and taught elocution in schools.
When the Great War came, all our Soldiers were returning straight from the front, a lot of them shell-shocked, unable to speak
somebody said, "Lionel, you're very good at all this speech stuff.
Do you thin you can possibly help these poor buggers."
I did muscle therapy, exercise, relaxation, but I knew I had to go deeper.
These poor young blokes had cried out in fear, no-one was listening to them.
My job was to give them faith in their own voice and let them know that a friend was listening.
That must ring a few bells with you, Bertie.
You give a very noble account of yourself.
Make inquiries.
It's all true.
Inquiries have been made!
You have no idea who I have breathing down my neck?
I vouched for you and you have no...
credentials.
But lots of success!
I can't show you certificate - there was no training then.
Everything I know I know from experience, and that war... was some experience.
My plaque says, "L. Logue, Speech Defects."
No Dr., there are no letters after my name.
Lock me in the Tower.
- I would if I could!
- On what charge?
- Fraud!
With war looming, you've saddled this nation with a voiceless King.
You destroyed the happiness of my family.
All for the sake of ensnaring a star... patient you couldn't possibly hope to assist!
It'll be like mad...
King George the Third, there'll be mad King George the stammerer, who let his people down so badly in their hour of need!
What're you doing?
Get up!
You can't sit there!
Get up!
Why not?
It's a chair.
No, that's not a chair, that is... that is...
That is Saint Edward's Chair!
- People have carved their names on it.
That chair is the seat on which every King and Queen---
- It's held in a place by a large rock!
- That's the Stone of Scone, you are trivialising everything.
- You believe such bollocks.
- You're trivialising everything!
- I don't care how many royal...
- Listen to me.
Listen to me!
- ...arse have sat in this chair.
- Listen to me... !
- Listen to you?
!
By what right?
By the divine right, if you must!
I'm your King!
No you're not!
You told me so yourself.
You said you didn't want it.
Why should I waste my time listening to you?
- Because I have a right to be heard!
- Heard as what?
!
- I HAVE A VOICE!
Yes you do.
You have such a perservance, Bertie, you're the bravest man I know.
And you'll make a bloody good king.
- What on earth's going on, Sir?
- It's quite alright, Archbishop.
Mr Logue, you must know that I found a replacement English specialist with impeccable credentials.
Hence, your services will no longer be required.
- I'm sorry?
- Your Majesty's function is to consult and be advised.
And you didn't consuly, but you've just been advised.
Now I advise you: in this personal matter I will make my own decision.
My concern is for the head upon which I must place the crown.
I appreciate that Archbshop, but it's my head!
Your humble servant.
Thank you Bertie.
Shall we rehearse?
Come on up on your purge.
Now when you and Elizabeth enter through the West door, you'll be greeted by the hymn "I Was Glad When They Said Unto Me."
Actually you won't be that glad, because they sing it for a very long time.
Then your friend the Archbishop will ponce up the stairs toward you and say "Sir, is Your Majesty willing to take The Oath?"
- "I am willing".
- Course you are!
I'm gonna see what it sounds like in the cheap seats so even your old nanny can hear.
"Will you govern your peoples of Great Britain, Ireland, Canada,
Australia and New Zealand according to their lands and customs?"
- "I solemnly promise so do so."
- LOUDER!
I can't hear you up the back.
"I SOLEMNLY PROMISE TO DO SO!"
Very good!
"Will you to your power cause Law and Justice, in Mercy, to be executed in all your judgements?"
"I will." "I WILL!"
Then there's a very long bit about upholding the faith, goes on, rubbish, rubbish, rubbish.
To which you finally say...
"The things which I have herebefore promised, I will perform and keep.
So help me God."
And that's all you'll say.
Four short responses, kiss the book and sign the oath and you're King.
Easy.
You nearly crowned him backwards Archbishop!
Someone had removed the thread marking the back of the Crown, Sir.
Try not lose the thread, Archbishop.
Archbishop, we're missing Papa.
Very good, very good.
Archbishop.
Well, I hope Your Majesties are thrilled with the result.
You could switch that machine off now.
No, wait, keep going.
Do have a seat, Archbishop.

- Papa?
- Mmm?
- Papa, what's he saying?
I don't know, but he seems to be saying it rather well.
Sir, I have asked to see you today in order to tender my resignation as Prime Minister.
I am so sorry to hear that, Mr Baldwin.
Neville Chamberlain will take my place as Prime Minister.
It's a matter of principal.
I was mistaken.
I have found it impossible to believe that there is any man in the World so lacking in moral feeling as Hitler,
but the world might be hurled for a second time into the abyss of destructive War.
Churchill was right all along.
This was always Hitler's intention.
I am many very sorry to leave you in this great time of crisis.
I am very much afraid Sir, that your greatest test is yet to come.
I am speaking to you from the cabinet room at 10 Downing Street.
This morning the British Ambassador in Berlin handed the German Government a final note
stating that unless we heard from them by 11 o'clock that they were prepared at once to withdraw their troops from Poland, a state of war would exist between us.
I have to tell you now that no such undertaking has been received, and that consequently this country is at war with Germany.
At last Sir, here is your speech.
You are on air at six.
I've timed it at just under nine minutes.
The wording is fully approved.
The Prime Minister will be joining you for the broadcast which will go out live across the Nation, the Empire and to our Armed Forces.
Get Logue here immediately.
- There's the barrage balloons.
- Yes.
They got them up there quickly.
Yeah.
.
.
.
- Should we pull over and find shelter?
- No, go straight on.
We'll be alright
.
- Yes.
Sir?
- Lionel Logue.
Major Hartley's expecting me.
This is my son Laury.
- Thank you, Laurie.
- Good luck, Dad.
- The King's Speech.
- Thank you, Sir.
We have about forty minutes until the broadcast.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
"There may be dark days ahead, and..."
Try again.
"There may be dark days ahead, and..."
Turn the hesitations into pauses, and say to yourself, "God save the King".
I say that continuously, but apparently no one's listening.
Long pauses are good: they add solemnity to great occasions.
Then I'm the solemnest king who ever lived.
And Lionel, if I am to be King...
where is my power?
Can I...
Can I form a Government?
Can I...
Can I levy a tax or declare a war?
No!
Yet I am the seat of all authority.
Why?
Because the Nation believes that when I speak, I speak for them.
Yet I cannot speak!
Let's take it all again from the top.
"In this grave hour..."
"In this grave hour fuck fuck fuck perhaps the most fateful in our history bugger shit shit
I send to every household of my...
You see "P" is always difficult, even when I'm singing.
Bounce onto it "a-peoples", not "people".
"a-people household of me..." "a-peoples both at home and overseas..."
Beaut.
...this message, doo-dah, spoken with the same depth of feeling, doo-dah-dey, ...for each one of you as if I were able to shit fuck bugger cross your threshold and speak to you"
In your head, now: "I have a right to be bloody well heard!"
Bloody well heard, bloody well heard, bloody well heard myself!
Now Waltz.
Move!
Get continuous movement.
"For the second time in the lives of most of us we are at..."
- "we are..." Take a pause.
- Lionel, I can't do this.
Bertie, you can do it.
- Have a look at the last paragraph.
- Bertie, it's time.
There he is.
- Archbishop.
- Your Majesty.
A great moment, Sir.
- Prime Minister.
- Your Majesty.
Nice to see you again, so soon.
Good of you to be here, I'm sure you've had rather a busy day.
Let's hope we have no more interruptions from those damned sirens, Sir.
Or the wretched dogs.
- Congratulations.
First Lord of the Admiralty.
- Your Majesty.
The long walk.
Good luck, Sir.
I too dread this apparatus.
Had a speech impediment myself, you know.
- I didn't.
- Family secret.
Tongue-tied.
An operation was considered to be too dangerous.
I eventually made an asset of it.
- Thank you, Mr Churchill.
- Good, Sir.
Darling.
- How long, Logue?
- Just under three minutes, Sir.
.
Five seconds, Sir.
5, 4, 3 , 2 , 1.
.
.
- Mr Wood.
- Good luck, Your Majesty.
Mr Wood.
- You'll be decorated, Logue.
- I made it cosy.
Some fresh air.
There you are, Darling.
I'm thistle sifter, I've a sieve of sifted thistles and a sieve on unsifted thistles.
I've a sieve of sifted thistles and a sieve on unsifted thistles, because I'm...
Bertie, darling, make sure it's not switched on!
Remember the red light will blink four times and then I've asked them to turn it off, because we don't want that evil eye staring at you all the way through.
One minute, sir.
I am sure you will be splendid.
Fourty seconds, Sir.
Logue, however this turns out,
I don't know how to thank you for what you've done.
Knighthood?
Twenty seconds.
Forget everything else and just say it to me.
Say it to me, as a friend.
In this grave hour,
perhaps the most fateful in our history,
I send to every household of my peoples,
both at home
and overseas
this message spoken with the same depth of feeling
for each one of you as if I were able to cross your threshold
and speak to you myself.
For the second time in the lives of most of us we are at... at war.
Over and over again we have tried to find
a peaceful way out of the differences between ourselves and those who are now our enemies.
But it has been in vain.
We have been forced into a conflict.
For we are called, to meet the challenge of a principle which, if it were to prevail, would be fatal to any civilized order
in the world.
Such a principle, stripped of all disguise,
is surely the mere
primitive doctrine that might is right.
For the sake of all that we ourselves hold dear, it is unthinkable that we should refuse to meet the challenge.
It is to this high purpose that I now call my people at home and my peoples across the seas, who will make our cause their own.
I ask them to stand calm and firm, and united in this time of trial
the task will be hard.
There may be dark days ahead, and war can no longer be confined to the battlefield.
But we can only do the right as we see the right and reverently commit our cause to God.
If one and all we keep resolutely faithful to it, then, with God's help,
we shall prevail.
Very good, Bertie.
You still stammered on the "w".
Had to throw in a few so they knew it was me.
Congratulations, your Majesty.
A true broadcaster.
Thank you, Mr Wood.
Congratulations, your Majesty.
- Congratulations, your Majesty.
- Thank you.
Ready.
- Good?
- Perfect.
Your first war time speech.
Congratulations.
Expect I shall have to do a great deal more.
Thank you, Logue.
Well done, my friend.
Thank you, Your Majesty.
I knew you'd be good.
Thank you, Lionel.
Onwards?
Congratulations, Sir.
Almost did it better then myself, Sir.
Your Majesty, I'm speechless.
Congratulations, Sir.
Gentlemen.
Congratulations, your Majesty.
So how was Papa, Elizabeth?
Halting at first, but you got much better Papa.
Bless you.
- And how about you, Margaret?
- You were just splendid, Papa.
Of course I was.
We all ready?
Come on girls.
long2375
You are live in two minutes, Your Royal Highness.
Sir?
At the microphone, Do your work Sir.
I am sure you will be splendid.
Just take your time.
Time to go.
Good afternoon.
This is the BBC National Programme and Empire Services taking you to Wembley Stadium for the Closing Ceremony of the Empire Exhibition.
where His Royal Highness the Duke of York will read a message from His Father;
His Majesty, King George V.
58 British Colonies and Dominions have taken part, making this the largest Exhibition staged anywhere in the world.
Remember Sir, Three flashes;
then steady 'red' means you are Live.
Using the new invention of radio,
The Opening Ceremony was the first time his Majesty the King addressed his subjects on the wireless.
At the close of the first Season,
The heir to the throne His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales, made his first broadcast.
And today, his younger brother His Royal Highness, the Duke of York will give his inaugural broadcast to the Nation and the World.
I have received... from his Majesty... t' ek
...The King.
Inhale deep into your lungs..
Your Royal Highness.
Relaxes your larynx, does it not?
Cigarette smoking calms the nerves and gives you confidence.
If Your Highness will be very kind as to open your hand...
It's Sterilized.
Now..
Now... if I may take the liberty?
...insert some into your mouth.
Excuse me, Doctor.
What is the purpose of this?
The classic approach, it cured Demosthenes.
That was in Ancient Greece... uh
Has it worked since?
Now, if you would be so kind as to read...
A wealth of words.
Fight against those marbles, Your Royal Highness.
Enunciate!
A little more concentration your Royal Higness.
I nearly swallowed the bloody things!
Thank you so much, Doctor, it's been most... hmm interesting.
Insert marbles!
He can insert his own bloody marbles...!
Tick, tock, tick, tock.
You know, you can't keep doing this, Bertie.
I know.
Promise me:
no more.
Hello.
Is anyone there?
I'm just in the loo.
Ah, Mrs. Johnson There you are.
I'm sorry, there's no receptionist.
I like to keep things simple.
"Poor and content is rich and rich enough"
- Sorry?
- Shakespeare.
How are you?
How do you do?
Coughing a lot.
Now, this is slightly awkward, But..
I'm afraid you're late.
Yes, I'm afraid I am.
Where's Mr Johnson?
He doesn't know I'm here.
That's not a promising start.
My husband has seen everyone to no avail.
Awefully 'fraid he's given up hope.
He hasn't seen me.
You're awfully sure of yourself.
Well, I'm sure of anyone who wants to be cured.
Of course, he wishes to be cured.
My husband is umm..
he's required to speak publicly.
Perhaps he should change jobs?
- He can't.
Indentured servitude?
Something of that nature.
Well we need to have your hubby pop by...
Uh..
Tuesday would be good...
He can give me his personal details and I'll make a frank appraisal and then, We can take it from there.
Doctor, forgive me.
I do not have a "hubby".
We don't 'pop'.
and nor do we ever talk about our private lives.
You...
must come to us.
I'm Sorry, Mrs Johnson, my game, my turf, my rules.
You'll have to talk over this with your hauband and then you can speak to me on the telephone.
Thank you very much for dropping by...
Good afternoon.
And what if my husband were the Duke of York?
The Duke of York?
Yes...
the Duke of York.
I thought the appointment was for "Johnson"?
Forgive me, your...?
- ..
Royal Highness.
Johnson was used during the Great War;
when the Navy didn't want the enemy to know 'he' was aboard.
- Am I... considered the enemy?
You will be, if you remain un- obliging.
Of course.
How did you find me, Your Royal Highness?
The President of the Speech Therapists Society.
Eileen McCleod?
She's a sport.
Dr McCleod warned me your antipodean methods were "unorthodox and controversial".
I warned her...
those were not my favorite words.
I can cure your husband.
But for my method to work I need trust and total equality;
Here, in the safety of my consultation room.
No exceptions.
Well then, in that case...
When can you start?
Still sounds a bit rough, mate.
You make me drive too slowly, Dad!
Did you pick mum up from Bridge?
Yes, I've hardly been out of the car all day.
I had a special visitor this afternoon.
- May I please leave this table
- How special, special?
No, You must stay, bored stupid, listening to your parents' inane conversation.
- Thanks Dad..
- and Mum.
- Me too.
- You meeting Jean?
- No, someone else.
Doctor?
Doctor?
Can't you help your brother with the washing... I'm fine.
Who's it Lionel?
Why bring it up if you can't talk about it?
Myrtle, It's just a woman, looking to help her husband.
Oh!
And I had a 'call'.
for an audition.
One of my favorites.
- Aren't they all?
It Could be a lot of fun.
I'm sure you'll be splendid.
They're a highly regarded group.
From Putney.
Tomorrow, Chapter IV.
'The Flight'.
Oh, to fly away!
Weren't they lucky!
Now Papa tell a story!
- Could I be a penguin instead?
Once, there were two princesses...
Princess Elizabeth and Princess Margaret.
whose Papa was a penguin.
This was because he had been turned into one by the wicket witch.
This was an...
inconvenient for him..
because he loved to hold his princesses in his arms... and you can't because he don't have wings like herrings
- Herrings don't have wings.
- Penguins have wings which is shaped like herrings and make matters worse... is that she sent him to the South Pole.
which is an awfully long walk.. back.
if you can't fly.
So..
When he reached the water, he dived in through the dept so fast... that he was in Southampton waters by lunchtime.
And from there, he took the 2.30 to Weybridge, changed at Clapham Junction and asked a passing Mallard the way to Buckingham Palace.
He swam up the Thames, out through the plughole, and gave the cook,
Mama and...
Mrs Whittaker quite a shock.
Now when the girls heard all the commotions, they ran to the kitchen where they gave him a good scrub, a mackerel and a kiss.
and as they kissed him, guess what he turned into?
- A handsome prince.
A short-tailed Albatross.
With wings so big that he could wrap them both his two girls together.
Now, now..
It's time for bed.
Will Mrs Simpson be there?
- My brother's insisting.
- Is he serious?
- About her coming to dinner?
- No.
About her!
- A married woman?
He can't be.
- She can.
By the way,
I think I found someone rather interesting.
On Harley Street.
A doctor.
- Out of the question.
I'm not having this conversation again.
The matter's settled.
- His approach seems rather different...
Now?
Now.
"Now is the winter of our discontent,
Made glorious summer by this sun of York".
"And all the clouds that lour'd upon our house
In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.
Now are our brows, bound with victorious... wreaths;
- Thank you!
Lovely diction Mr...?
- Logue.
Lionel Logue.
- Well, Mr. Logue.
I'm not hearing the cries of a deformed creature yearning to be King.
Nor did I realize Richard the Third was King of the Colonies.
I do know the lines.
I've played the role before.
- Sydney?
- Perth.
- Major theater town, is it?
- Enthusiastic.
- Ah.
- I was well reviewed.
Yes...
well...
Lionel,
I think our dramatic society, is looking for someone slightly younger and a... little more regal.
Where did you find this... physician?
Classifieds, next to "French model, Shepherd's Market".
He comes highly recommended.
Charges substantial fees in order to help the poor.
Oh dear, perhaps he's a Bolshevik?
!
No receptionist.
He likes to keep things simple.
- The Johnsons.
You can go in now, "Mr. Johnson".
Lionel says... wait here if you wish, Mrs Johnson.
Or, it being a p- pleasant day, p- perhaps take a stroll.
Was that alright...
Lionel?
Marvellous!
Willy.
You can stay and wait for your mom.
Mrs Johnson...
Mr Johnson, Do come in.
He's a good lad, Willy.
He could hardly make a sound, you know, when he first came to me.
My boys made those.
Good, aren't they?
Please make yourself comfortable.
I was told not to sit too close.
Well I believe when speaking with a Prince,
One waits for the prince to choose a topic.
Waiting for me to...
commence a conversation..
one can wait a rather long wait.
Do you Know any jokes?
Timing isn't my strong suit.
Cuppa tea?
No thank you.
Aren't you going to start treating me Dr Logue?
Only if you're interested in being treated.
Please, call me Lionel.
I prefer Doctor.
I prefer Lionel.
What'll I call you?
Your Royal Highness, then Sir after that.
A bit formal for here.
What about your name?
Prince Albert...
Frederick Arthur George?
How about Bertie?
Only my family uses that.
Perfect.
In here, it's better if we're equals.
If we were equal I wouldn't be here.
I'd be at home with my wife and no-one would give a damn.
Please, Don't do that.
I'm sorry?
I believe, Sucking smoke into your lungs will kill you.
My physicians say it relaxes the throat.
They're idiots.
They've all been knighted.
Makes it official then.
My 'castle', my rules.
What was your earliest memory?
What?
an earth do you mean?
Your First recollection.
I'm not... here to discuss my personal matters.
Why're you here then?
Because I bloody well stammer!
You have a bit of a temper?
One of my many faults.
When did the defect start?
I've always been this way!
I doubt that.
Don't tell me!
It's my stammer!
- Its my field.
I can assure you, no infant starts to speak with a stammer.
When did yours start?
four or five.
That's typical.
So I've been told.
I can't remember not doing it.
I can believe that.
Do you hesitate when you think?
Don't be ridiculous.
How about when you talk to yourself?
Everyone natters occasionally Bertie.
Stop calling me that!
I'm not going to call you anything else.
Then we shan't speak!
Are you charging for this, Doctor?
A fortune.
So, when you talk to yourself, do you stammer?
Of course not!
Well, that proves your impediment isn't a permanent part of you.
What do you think was the cause?
I don't know.
I don't care!
I stammer!
And no one can fix it.
I Bet you, you can read flawlessly, right here, right now.
And if I win, I get to ask questions.
- And if I win?
- You don't have to answer.
One usually...
wagers money.
A bob each to sweeten it?
Lets See your shilling?
- I don't...
carry money.
- I had a funny feeling you mightn't.
I'll stake you.
You can Pay me back next time.
- Who says there is a next time?
- I haven't agreed to take you on, yet.
Please stand.
and take a look at that...
I can't read this.
Then you owe me a shilling, for not trying.
"To be...
or not to be,...
That...
I can't read!
I haven't finished yet.
I'm going to record your voice and then play it back to you on the same machine.
This is brilliant.
It's the latest thing from America:
its a Silvertone.
Pop this on?
There's a bob in this, mate.
You can go home rich!
- You're playing music.
- I know.
How can I hear what I'm saying?
!
Surely a Prince's brain knows what its mouth is doing?
You're not well acquainted with Royal Princes, are you?
Hopeless.
Hopeless!
You were sublime.
Would I lie to a prince of the realm to win twelve-pence?
I've no idea what an Australian might do for that sort of money.
Let me play it back to you.
No.
All right then, I get to ask you the question.
Thank you Doctor,
I don't feel..
this is for me.
Thank You for your time, Bye.
- Sir?
the recording is free.
Please..
keep it as a souvenir.
KING GEORGE V For the present, the work to which we are all equally bound, is to arrive at a reasoned tranquillity within our borders, to regain prosperity in this time of depression without self-seeking and to carry with us those whom the burden of past years has disheartened or overborne.
To all, to each,
I wish a Happy Christmas.
God bless you.
Easy when you know how.
Have a go yourself.
Congratulations, Sir.
Ah, Mr Wood.
Splendid fellow.
Chap taught me everything I know:
let the microphone do the work.
Sit up, straight back, face boldly up to the bloody thing and stare it square in the eye, as you would any decent Englishman.
Show who's in command.
Papa, I D-d-don't thu-thu-think I c-c-can read this.
- This devilish device will change everything if you don't.
In the past all a King had to do was look respectable in uniform and not fall off his horse.
Now we must invade people's homes and ingratiate ourselves with them.
This family is reduced to those lowest, basest of all creatures... we've become... actors!
- we're not a family, we're a firm.
- Yet at any moment, some of us may be out of work.
Your darling brother, and future king!
The only wife he appears interested in is invariably the wife of another!
- He's broken off with Lady Furness.
And taken up a Mrs Simpson, a woman with two husbands living!
I told him straight, no divorced person could ever be received at court.
He said, "It made him sublimely happy."
I imagined that was because she was sleeping with him.
"I give you my word.. ' this is what he said.
"I give you my word we've never had immoral relations,"
Stared square into his father's eyes...
and lied!
When I'm dead that boy will ruin himself, this family, and this nation, within twelve months.
Who'll pick up the pieces?
Herr Hitler, intimidating half of Europe, Marshall Stalin the other half?
Who'll stand between us, the jackboots, and the proletarian abyss?
You?
With your older brother shirking his duties, you're going to have to do a lot more of this.
Have a go yourself.
Son.
Get it out boy!
...m-marvels of m-
- Modern... just take your time - form your words carefully
Science, I am enabled, this...
- Relax!
Just try it!
Do it!
Lying..
bastard.
"To be, or not to be, - that is the question: -
"... whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles, And by opposing end them.. "
".. to die...
to sleep; no more.."
Strictly business.
No p..
personal nonsense.
I thought I'd made that very clear in our interview.
- Got the shilling you owe me?
- No I haven't!
- Didn't think so.
Besides, you tricked me!
Physical excercises and tricks are important...
What you're asking will only deal with the surface of the problem.
That's sufficient.
As far as i see it, My hausband... has mechanical difficulties with his speech.
Maybe...
Just deal with that.
- l'm willing to work hard, Doctor Logue...
- Lionel.
- Are you..
are you willing to do your part?
Alright.
You want mechanics?
We need to relax your throat muscles and strengthen your tongue.
By repeating tongue twisters for example.
"I am a thistle-sifter.
I have a sieve of sifted thistles and a sieve of unsifted thistles.
Because I am a thistle sifter. "
- Fine!
You have a flabby tummy, we must build up the strength in your diaphragm.
Simple mechanics.
That is all we ask.
And that's about a shilling's worth.
Forget about the blessed shilling!
Perhaps, upon occasion, you might be requested some assistance in cope with a minor event.
Will that agreeable?
Of course.
That will be the full extent of your services.
- Shall I see you next week?
- I shall see you every day.
Ahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahah.
Feel the loosening of the jaw
Take a nice deep breath.
Expand your chest..
How do you feel?
full of hot air.
- Isn't that what public speaking is all about?
Are you alright, Bertie?
This is actually quite good fun,
- Hello, Bertie.
- Hello David.
Where've you been?
Been busy.
- So was I.
Elizabeth has pneumonia.
I'm sorry.
She'll recover.
Father won't.
- l'll drive.
Old bugger's doing this on purpose.
Dying?
Departing prematurely...
to complicate matters.
Oh for heaven's sake, David.
You know how long he's been ill.
Wallis explained.
She's terribly clever about this thing.
...whereas by letters patent underthe Great Seal, bearing date of Westminster, the eleventh June 1912 his Majesty King George V did constitute, order and declare that there should be a guardian,
Custos Regni, in the form of Councillors of State
It's the order of the Council for the State, Sir.
So we may act on your behalf.
I'm still confused...
Approved.
Thank you.
Feeling a little better Sir?
No. I'm not feeling any better.
I feel dreadful.
Have you been ice skating?
.. Ice skating.
No, George.
...I know, darling, a talk, even a lovely long talk, is a poor substitute for holding tight and making drowsy.
Nor making our own drowsies either, as we've had to dofar too often lately.
David, Dinner?
- l'm on with Wallis!
Wallis misses me terribly.
- Mama says you're late for dinner.
- She forgets Papa's bloody clocks were always half an hour fast!
How is the king?
I hope he is not in pain.
No, no, His Majesty, he's quieter now.
Thank you.
David, If your father were well, tardiness would not be tolerated.
None of this..
unpleasantness would be tolerated
You know Sir, I appreciate that yo are different from your father in your outlook and temperament.
I want you to know that whenever the King questioned your conduct,
I tried in your interest, to present it in a most favourable light.
I can always trust you to have my best interests at heart.
I fear, our vigil will not be of long duration.
Please, continue.
We commend our brother George to the mercy of God, our Maker and Redeemer.
Long live the King.
I hope, I will make good as he has made good.
What on earth was that?
Poor Wallis.
Now I'm trapped!
Time for a Shake, dad?
You sure?
Go on.
Put your thinking caps on.
Bet its the Scottish Play.
No, I bet it's Othello.
It's always Othello.
"Art thou afeard?"
Caliban!
Oh!
For heaven's sake.. that was a lucky guess!
Don't listen to egghead.
Go on, Dad.
"the isle is full ofnoises,Sounds and sweet airs, that give delight, and hurt not.
Sometimes a thousand twanging instruments Will hum about mine ears;
and sometimes voices,That, if then I had waked after long sleep,Will make me sleep again:"
Alright, clever clogs, what comes next?
".. and then, in dreaming, The clouds me thought would open,
and show riches Ready to drop upon me;
that when I'm awake... "
...when I waked, I cried to dream again. "
It's such a sad thought.
My next patient must be early.
You better go lads, I'm sorry.
Won't be a moment, Clifford.
Bertie!
they told me not to expect you.
I am Sorry about your father.
I don't wish to intrude..
oh no...
course.
Please come in.
I've been practising.
One hour a day.
In spite of everything.
What's going on there?
I was, sorry, mucking around with my kids.
Do you feel like working today?
A Curtis bi-plane.
I'll put on some hot milk.
Logue, I'd kill for something stronger.
I wasn't there for my father's death.
Still makes me sad.
I can imagine so.
What did you father do?
He was a brewer.
At least there was free beer.
Here's to the memory of your father.
I was informed, after the fact... that my father's last words were:
"Bertie has more guts than the rest of his brothers put together. "
He couldn't say that to my face.
My brother.
What about him?
Try singing.
I'm sorry.
Know any songs?
Songs?
Yes songs.
"Swanee River".
I love that song.
Happens to be my favorite.
Sing me the chorus.
No.
Certainly not.
Always wanted to build models.
Father wouldn't allow it.
He collected stamps.
we had to collect stamps.
You can finish that off.
If you sing.
I'm not going to sit here, wobbling.
You can with me.
Because you're peculiar.
I take that as a compliment.
I'm not crooning "Swanee River!"
Try "Camptown Races" then.
"My brother D, he said to me, doo- dah doo-dah... " Continuous sound will give you flow.
Does it feel strange, now that David's on the throne?
To tell the truth,
It was a relief...
Knowing I wouldn't be King.
But unless he produces an heir, you're next in line.
And your daughter, Elizabeth, would then succeed you.
"You're barking up the wrong tree now, Doctor, Doctor. "
"Lionel" See?
You didn'stammer.
Of course I didn't stammer, I was singing!
Well, as a little reward, you get to put some glue on these struts.
Your boy, won't mind?
No, not at all.
David and I were very close.
Young bucks...
You know.
Chase the same girls?
David was always very helpful in arranging introductions.
We shared the expert ministrations of "Paulette" in Paris.
Not at the same time of course.
Did David tease you?
Yes, they all did.
"Buh-buh-buh-Bertie".
Father encouraged it. "Get it out, boy!" Said it would make me stop.
Said... "I was afraid of my father, and my children are damn well going to be afraid of me".
Are you naturally right handed?
Left.
I was punished.
Now I use the right.
Yes, that's very common with stammerers.
Anything other corrections?
Knock knees.
Metal splints were made... worn night and day.
That must have been painful.
Bloody agony.
Straight legs now.
Who were you closest to in your family?
Nannies.
Not my first nanny, though.. she loved David... hated me.
When we are presented to my parents for the daily viewing, she'd pinch me..
I'd cry and be handed back to her..
immediately.
Then...
she would...
Sing it.
" then she wouldn't feed me, far far away. "
Took three years for my parents to notice.
As you can imagine, it caused some stomach problems.
Still.
What about your brother Johnnie?
Were you close to him?
Johnny..
Sweet boy.
Epilepsy... and... he was 'different'.
Died at 13, hidden from view.
I've been told it's not catching.
Do you want a top-up?
Please.
You know, Lionel, you're the first ordinary Englishman...
Australian.
...I've ever really spoken to.
Sometimes, when I ride through the streets and see, you know, the Common Man staring at me, I'm struck by how little I know of hislife, and how little he knows of mine.
Thank you.
What're friends for.
I wouldn't know.
"I sifted seven thick-stalked thistles through strong thicksieves.
I sifted seven... "
One hundred year old oaks... removed to improve the view!
Who does she think she is!
Nonetheless... we must try to be pleasant towards Mrs Simpson.
You know she calls me "The Fat Scottish Cook"?
You're not fat.
I'm getting plump.
You seldom cook.
I sifted seven.
Shut up!
Their Royal Highnesses the Duke and Duchess of York.
How lovely to see you both.
Welcome to our little country shack.
I came at the invitation of the King.
Hello David.
you're making some changes to the garden, I see yes, I am.
I am not quite finished.
Don't tell me I behaved badly, Mr Churchill.
On the contrary, your Royal Highness.
Etiquette decrees royalty must be greeted by the official host: in this case: the King.
Not a commoner.
- Thank you.
What is her hold on him?
I have no idea.
Apparently she has certain... skills, ...in an establishment in Shanghai.
David, I've been trying to see you... I've been terribly busy.
Doing what?
Kinging.
Kinging?
is a precarious business!
These days.
Where is the Russian Tsar?
Where is Cousin Wilhelm?
You're being dreary.
Is Kinging laying off eighty staff at Sandringham and buying yet more pearls for Wallis while there ar people marching across Europe singing "The Red Flag"?
Stop your worrying.
Herr Hitler will sort that lot out.
Who'll sort out Herr Hitler?
And you've put that woman into our mother's suite?
Mother's not still in the bed, is she?
That's not funny.
Wally likes the very best.
I don't care what woman you carry on with at night, as long as you show up for duty in the morning!
Wally is not just some woman I am carrying on with.
We intend to marry.
Excuse me?
She's filing a petition for divorce.
Good God.
Can't you just give her a nice house and a title?
I won't have her as my mistress.
David, the Church does not recognise divorce and you are the head of the Church.
Haven't I any rights?
Many privileges...
Not the same thing.
Your beloved Common Man may marry for love, why not me?
If you were the Common Man, on what basis could you possibly claim to be King?
!
Sounds like you've studied our wretched constitution.
Sounds like you haven't.
Is that what this is all about?
Brushing up..
hence the elocution lessons?
I'm trying to t-t...
Yearning for a larger audience are we, B- b-b-bertie?
D- don't...
Younger brother trying to push older brother off throne..
Pa pa..
... Positively medieval.
Where have you been all this time?
- Never you mind.
Ahh.. what a complicated lovely coon you are.
- I try to be.
All that work, down the drain.
My own brother...
I couldn't say..
I couldn't say a word in reply!
Why do you stammer more with David than you do with me?
Because you're bloody well paid to listen!
Bertie, I'm not a geisha girl.
Stop trying to be so bloody clever!
What is it about David that stops you speaking?
What is it about you, that bloody makes want you to go on about it, all the time.
Vulgar but fluent.
You don't stammer when you swear.
Bugger off!
Is that the best you can do?
Well, bloody bugger to you, you beastly bastard.
A public school prig can do better than that.
Shit!
Shit, shit, shit!
shit!
See how defecation flows trippingly from the tongue?
Because I'm angry!
You Know the f-word?
Fornication?
OH Bertie.
Fuck.
Fuck, fuck, fuck!
Yes!
You see!
Not a hesitation!
Bloody, bloody, bloody!
Shit, shit, shit!
Bugger, bugger, bugger!
Fuck, fuck, fuck!
Dad?
What's going on?
Sorry.
Finish your homework
Well.. that's a side of you we don't get to see that often.
No.
No we're not supposed to really, not publicly.
Let's get some air.
No Logue, I don't think that's a good idea.
What's the matter?
What's got you so upset?
Logue, you have no idea.
My brother is infatuated with a woman who's been married twice.
She's asking for a divorce and David is determined to marry her.
Mrs Wallis Simpson of Baltimore.
That's not right.
Queen Wallis of Baltimore?
Unthinkable.
Can he do that?
Absolutely not.
But he's going to anyway.
All hell's broken loose.
- Can't they carry on privately?
- If only they would.
- Where does that leave you?
I know my place!
I'll do anything...
in my power to keep my brother on the throne.
- Is it that serious?
your place may be on the throne.
I am not an alternative to my brother.
If you had to you could outshine David...
Don't take liberties!
That's bordering on treason.
I'm just saying you could be King.
You could do it!
That is treason!
I'm trying to get you to realise you need not be governed by fear.
I've had enough of this!
What're you afraid of?
Your poisonous words!
Why'd you come to me?
You are not some middle class bugger, who needs elocution lessons so you can chit-chat...
Don't instruct me on my duties!
I'm the son of a...
King... the brother of a king.
You're the disappointing son of a brewer!
A jumped-up jackeroo from the outback!
You're nobody.
These sessions are over!
It's not because she's an American.
That is the least of it.
It's because she is a soon to be a twice divorced American, and the King as head of The Church of England...
can not marry a divorced woman.
And Sir, I apologize for the nature of this, according to Scotland Yard, the King has not always possess exclusive.. rights
to Mrs. Simpson's...
favours and affections, sharing them with a married used car salesman, a certain Mr Guy Trundle.
In addition, it is also rumoured...
Hitler's ambassador, Count von Ribbentrop, sends her 17 carnations every day.
Should your brother continue to ignore the advice of His Government, He must abdicate.
Otherwise His Government has no choice but to resign.
Prime Minister, you'd leave the country without a government?
Does the King do what he wants, or does he do what his people expect him to do?
What's the matter, love?
I'm Just having trouble with a patient.
That Isn't like you..
why?
He's scared...
He is afraid with his own shadow.
Isn't that why they come to you?
This fellow could be somebody great, and he's fighting me.
Perhaps, he doesn't want to be great.
Perhaps that's what you want.
I might have overstepped the mark.
Apologize,
Do you both good.
I'm very sorry, Mr Logue, the Duke is busy.
I'm happy to wait.
Or I could come back later.
As I said, the Duke is terribly busy.
Thank you.
The parliament will not support their marriage.
But there were other reasons for concern, Sir.
He was careless with state papers.
He lacked commitment and resolve.
There were those that worried where he would stand when war comes with Germany.
We're not coming to that?
Indeed we are, Sir.
Prime Minister Baldwin may deny this, but Hitler's intent is crystal clear.
War with Germany will come, and we will need a King behind whom we can all stand united.
I fear... my brother is not of sound mind, at this time.
Have you thought what you will call yourself?
Certainly not Albert, Sir.
Too Germanic.
What about George?
After your father?
George the sixth.
It has rather a nice continuity to it, don't you think?
David!
Thank God.
You look exhausted!
How are you bearing up?
Bertie.
The decision's been made.
I have to go.
I cannot accept that.
You are in no condition to make that decision.
I'm afraid there's no other way.
I must marry her.
My mind's made up.
I'm... sorry.
That's a terrible thing to hear.
David, nobody wants that.
I least of all.
" At long last I am able to say, a few words of my own.
I have never wanted to withhold anything, but until now, it has not been constitutionally possible for me to speak.
A few hours ago I discharged my last duty as King and Emperor.
Now that I have been succeeded by my brother, the Duke of York my first words must be to declare my allegiance to him.
This I do with all my heart.
You all know the reasons which have impelled me to renounce the throne.
But you must believe me, when I tell you
I have found it impossible to carry the heavy burden of responsibility and to discharge my duties..
as King as I would wish to do without the help and support of the woman I love...
And I want you to know,
.. This decision has been made less difficult to me by the sure knowledge that my brother, with his long training in the public affairs of this country and with his fine qualities will be able to take my place forth with
without interruption or injury to the life and progress of the empire."
I meet you today... in circumstances which are -
Mama, will we have space for our horses in our new home?
Of course we will, darling, we'll have a palace of rooms.
Curtsey.
Your Majesty.
How was it?
I'm trying to familiarise myself with what a state paper looks like.
A despatch from Mr Baldwin which I don't understand a word of.
David's finances.
The Christmas broadcast -
I think that might be a mistake.
Plans for the Coronation -
I think that's an even bigger mistake.
I'm not a King.
I'm a naval officer.
Its the only thing I know.
I'm not a King.
Dear, dear man...
You know...
i refused your first two marriage proposals, not because I didn't love you, but because I couldn't bear the royal cage.
Couldn't bear the idea of a life of tours and public duties, a life that no longer was really to be my own.
But then I thought... he stammers so beautifully... they'll leave us alone.
Waiting for a king to apologize, one can wait rather a long wait.
I'm afraid we're slightly late.
This is home.
Myrtle's at bridge.
I've made sure the boys are out.
It's lovely.
Absolutely lovely.
Would you like some tea, Ma'am?
Yes. I'll help myself.
Off you go...
Or must I knock your heads together?
Here's your shilling,
I understand... what you were tryingto say, Logue.
I went about it the wrong way.
I'm sorry.
Now here I am.
Is the nation ready for two minutes of radio silence?
Every stammerer always fears they will fall back to square one.
I don't let that happen.
If I fail in my duty...
David could come back.
I've seen the placards
"Save Our King!"
They don't mean me.
Every other monarch in history succeeded someone who was dead, or just about to be.
My predecessor is not only alive, but very much so.
What a bloody mess!
I can't even give them a Christmas Speech.
Like your Dad used to do?
Precisely.
He's not here anymore.
Yes he is.
He's on that shilling I gave you.
Easy enough to give away.
You don't have to carry him around in your pocket.
Or your brother.
You don't need to be afraid of the things as you were afraid of when you were five.
You're very much your own man, Bertie.
Am I?
Your face is next, mate.
Lionel?
Myrtle!
- Is it alright?
- Yes.
Bertie, come here.
- Are you alright, Logue?
- Yes.
- Shall we go through?
- Trust me.
It's important.
What is it?
- Your...
Your...
- It's "Your Majesty", the first time.
After that, it's "Ma'am," as in Ham, not Ma'Im as in Palm.
I haven't told her about us.
Sit down, relax.
I'm told your husband calls my husband Bertie and my husband calls your husband Lionel.
I trust you won't call me Liz.
Your Majesty, you may call me Mrs Logue, Ma'am.
Very nice to meet you, Mrs Logue.
Logue, we can't stand here all day.
Yes we can.
Look, I need to wait for the right moment.
- Logue, you're being a coward!
- You're damn right.
Get out there, man!
Hello, Myrtle darling!
You're early.
I believe you two have met!
But I didn't think, you know...
King George the Sixth.
- It's very nice to meet you.
Will their Majesties be staying to dinner?
We would love to, such a treat, but alas... a previous engagement.
What a pitty.
- Archbishop.
- Welcome, your Majesty.
What a glorious tranformation, Sir.
I hope you'll forgive us if we continue out preparations.
And now you will allow me to guide you through the ceremony.
We begin of course at the West door, then into the nave.
I see you all your pronouncements are to be broadcast, Archbishop.
Ah, yes, wireless is indeed a Pandora's Box.
I'm afraid I also have to permit the newsreel cameras.
The product of which I shall personally edit.
Without momentary hesitation.
This is Doctor Logue of Harley Street.
He's my speech therapist.
- Your Grace.
- Had I known that Your Majesty was seeking assistance
I should've made my own recommendation.
Dr. Logue... will be attending the Coronation.
Well of course I shall speak with the Dean, but it was extremely difficult.
I should like the Doctor to be seated in the King's Box.
But members of your Family will be seated there, Sir.
That is why it's suitable.
And now, if you don't mind Your Grace, we need the premises.
My dear fellow, this is Westminster Abbey!
The Church must prepare his Majesty.
My preparations are equalized in important
With complete privacy, if you don't mind.
Those are my wishes, Your Grace.
I shall place the Abbey at Your Majesty's disposal... this evening.
Your Majesty.
I can't believe I'm walking on Chaucer and Handel and Dickens.
Everything alright?
Let's get cracking.
I'm not here to rehearse, Doctor Logue.
Call me Lionel.
True, you... never...
called yourself "Doctor."
I did that... for you.
No training, no... diploma, no... qualifications.
Just a... great deal of nerve.
The star chamber inquisition, is this?
You asked trust and... total equality.
Bertie, I heard you at Wembley.
I was there.
My son Laurie said "Dad, do you think you could help that poor man?"
What, as a failed actor!
?
It's true, I'm not a doctor, and yes I acted a bit,
Well I recited in pubs and taught elocution in schools.
When the Great War came, all our Soldiers were returning straight from the front, a lot of them shell-shocked, unable to speak
somebody said, "Lionel, you're very good at all this speech stuff.
Do you thin you can possibly help these poor buggers. "
I did muscle therapy, exercise, relaxation, but I knew I had to go deeper.
These poor young blokes had cried out in fear, no-one was listening to them.
My job was to give them faith in their own voice and let them know that a friend was listening.
That must ring a few bells with you, Bertie.
You give a very noble account of yourself.
Make inquiries.
It's all true.
Inquiries have been made!
You have no idea who I have breathing down my neck?
I vouched for you and you have no...
credentials.
But lots of success!
I can't show you certificate - there was no training then.
Everything I know I know from experience, and that war... was some experience.
My plaque says, "L. Logue, Speech Defects."
No Dr., there are no letters after my name.
Lock me in the Tower.
- I would if I could!
- On what charge?
- Fraud!
With war looming, you've saddled this nation with a voiceless King.
You destroyed the happiness of my family.
All for the sake of ensnaring a star... patient you couldn't possibly hope to assist!
It'll be like mad...
King George the Third, there'll be mad King George the stammerer, who let his people down so badly in their hour of need!
What're you doing?
Get up!
You can't sit there!
Get up!
Why not?
It's a chair.
No, that's not a chair, that is... that is...
That is Saint Edward's Chair!
- People have carved their names on it.
That chair is the seat on which every King and Queen-
- It's held in a place by a large rock!
- That's the Stone of Scone, you are trivialising everything.
- You believe such bollocks.
- You're trivialising everything!
- I don't care how many royal...
- Listen to me.
Listen to me!
- ... arse have sat in this chair.
- Listen to me...!
- Listen to you?
!
By what right?
By the divine right, if you must!
I'm your King!
No you're not!
You told me so yourself.
You said you didn't want it.
Why should I waste my time listening to you?
- Because I have a right to be heard!
- Heard as what?
!
- I HAVE A VOICE!
Yes you do.
You have such a perservance, Bertie, you're the bravest man I know.
And you'll make a bloody good king.
- What on earth's going on, Sir?
- It's quite alright, Archbishop.
Mr Logue, you must know that I found a replacement English specialist with impeccable credentials.
Hence, your services will no longer be required.
- l'm sorry?
- Your Majesty's function is to consult and be advised.
And you didn't consuly, but you've just been advised.
Now I advise you: in this personal matter I will make my own decision.
My concern is for the head upon which I must place the crown.
I appreciate that Archbshop, but it's my head!
Your humble servant.
Thank you Bertie.
Shall we rehearse?
Come on up on your purge.
Now when you and Elizabeth enter through the West door, you'll be greeted by the hymn "I Was Glad When They Said Unto Me. "
Actually you won't be that glad, because they sing it for a very long time.
Then your friend the Archbishop will ponce up the stairs toward you and say "Sir, is Your Majesty willing to take The Oath?"
- "I am willing".
- Course you are!
I'm gonna see what it sounds like in the cheap seats so even your old nanny can hear.
"Will you govern your peoples of Great Britain, Ireland, Canada,
Australia and New Zealand according to their lands and customs?"
- "I solemnly promise so do so."
- LOUDER!
I can't hear you up the back.
"I SOLEMNLY PROMISE TO DO SO!"
Very good!
"Will you to your power cause Law and Justice, in Mercy, to be executed in all your judgements?"
"I will." "I WILL!"
Then there's a very long bit about upholding the faith, goes on, rubbish, rubbish, rubbish.
To which you finally say...
"The things which I have herebefore promised, I will perform and keep.
So help me God. "
And that's all you'll say.
Four short responses, kiss the book and sign the oath and you're King.
Easy.
You nearly crowned him backwards Archbishop!
Someone had removed the thread marking the back of the Crown, Sir.
Try not lose the thread, Archbishop.
Archbishop, we're missing Papa.
Very good, very good.
Archbishop.
Well, I hope Your Majesties are thrilled with the result.
You could switch that machine off now.
No, wait, keep going.
Do have a seat, Archbishop.

- Papa?
- Mmm?
- Papa, what's he saying?
I don't know, but he seems to be saying it rather well.
Sir, I have asked to see you today in order to tender my resignation as Prime Minister.
I am so sorry to hear that, Mr Baldwin.
Neville Chamberlain will take my place as Prime Minister.
It's a matter of principal.
I was mistaken.
I have found it impossible to believe that there is any man in the World so lacking in moral feeling as Hitler,
but the world might be hurled for a second time into the abyss of destructive War.
Churchill was right all along.
This was always Hitler's intention.
I am many very sorry to leave you in this great time of crisis.
I am very much afraid Sir, that your greatest test is yet to come.
I am speaking to you from the cabinet room at 10 Downing Street.
This morning the British Ambassador in Berlin handed the German Government a final note
stating that unless we heard from them by 11 o'clock that they were prepared at once to withdraw their troops from Poland, a state of war would exist between us.
I have to tell you now that no such undertaking has been received, and that consequently this country is at war with Germany.
At last Sir, here is your speech.
You are on air at six.
I've timed it at just under nine minutes.
The wording is fully approved.
The Prime Minister will be joining you for the broadcast which will go out live across the Nation, the Empire and to our Armed Forces.
Get Logue here immediately.
- There's the barrage balloons.
- Yes.
They got them up there quickly.
Yeah.
- Should we pull over and find shelter?
- No, go straight on.
We'll be alright
- Yes.
Sir?
- Lionel Logue.
Major Hartley's expecting me.
This is my son Laury.
- Thank you, Laurie.
- Good luck, Dad.
- The King's Speech.
- Thank you, Sir.
We have about forty minutes until the broadcast.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
"There may be dark days ahead, and..."
Try again.
"There may be dark days ahead, and..."
Turn the hesitations into pauses, and say to yourself, "God save the King".
I say that continuously, but apparently no one's listening.
Long pauses are good: they add solemnity to great occasions.
Then I'm the solemnest king who ever lived.
And Lionel, if I am to be King...
where is my power?
Can I...
Can I form a Government?
Can I...
Can I levy a tax or declare a war?
No!
Yet I am the seat of all authority.
Why?
Because the Nation believes that when I speak, I speak for them.
Yet I cannot speak!
Let's take it all again from the top.
"In this grave hour... "
"In this grave hour fuck fuck fuck perhaps the most fateful in our history bugger shit shit
I send to every household of my...
You see "P" is always difficult, even when I'm singing.
Bounce onto it "a-peoples", not "people".
"a-people household of me... " "a-peoples both at home and overseas... "
Beaut.
...this message, doo-dah, spoken with the same depth of feeling, doo-dah-dey, ...for each one of you as if I were able to shit fuck bugger cross your threshold and speak to you"
In your head, now: "I have a right to be bloody well heard!"
Bloody well heard, bloody well heard, bloody well heard myself!
Now Waltz.
Move!
Get continuous movement.
"For the second time in the lives of most of us we are at... "
- "we are... " Take a pause.
- Lionel, I can't do this.
Bertie, you can do it.
- Have a look at the last paragraph.
- Bertie, it's time.
There he is.
- Archbishop.
- Your Majesty.
A great moment, Sir.
- Prime Minister.
- Your Majesty.
Nice to see you again, so soon.
Good of you to be here, I'm sure you've had rather a busy day.
Let's hope we have no more interruptions from those damned sirens, Sir.
Or the wretched dogs.
- Congratulations.
First Lord of the Admiralty.
- Your Majesty.
The long walk.
Good luck, Sir.
I too dread this apparatus.
Had a speech impediment myself, you know.
- I didn't.
- Family secret.
Tongue-tied.
An operation was considered to be too dangerous.
I eventually made an asset of it.
- Thank you, Mr Churchill.
- Good, Sir.
Darling.
- How long, Logue?
- Just under three minutes, Sir.
Five seconds, Sir.
5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
- Mr Wood.
- Good luck, Your Majesty.
Mr Wood.
- You'll be decorated, Logue.
- I made it cosy.
Some fresh air.
There you are, Darling.
I'm thistle sifter, I've a sieve of sifted thistles and a sieve on unsifted thistles.
I've a sieve of sifted thistles and a sieve on unsifted thistles, because I'm...
Bertie, darling, make sure it's not switched on!
Remember the red light will blink four times and then I've asked them to turn it off, because we don't want that evil eye staring at you all the way through.
One minute, sir.
I am sure you will be splendid.
Fourty seconds, Sir.
Logue, however this turns out,
I don't know how to thank you for what you've done.
Knighthood?
Twenty seconds.
Forget everything else and just say it to me.
Say it to me, as a friend.
In this grave hour,
perhaps the most fateful in our history,
I send to every household of my peoples,
both at home
and overseas
this message spoken with the same depth of feeling
for each one of you as if I were able to cross your threshold
and speak to you myself.
For the second time in the lives of most of us we are at... at war.
Over and over again we have tried to find
a peaceful way out of the differences between ourselves and those who are now our enemies.
But it has been in vain.
We have been forced into a conflict.
For we are called, to meet the challenge of a principle which, if it were to prevail, would be fatal to any civilized order
in the world.
Such a principle, stripped of all disguise,
is surely the mere
primitive doctrine that might is right.
For the sake of all that we ourselves hold dear, it is unthinkable that we should refuse to meet the challenge.
It is to this high purpose that I now call my people at home and my peoples across the seas, who will make our cause their own.
I ask them to stand calm and firm, and united in this time of trial
the task will be hard.
There may be dark days ahead, and war can no longer be confined to the battlefield.
But we can only do the right as we see the right and reverently commit our cause to God.
If one and all we keep resolutely faithful to it, then, with God's help,
we shall prevail.
Very good, Bertie.
You still stammered on the "w".
Had to throw in a few so they knew it was me.
Congratulations, your Majesty.
A true broadcaster.
Thank you, Mr Wood.
Congratulations, your Majesty.
- Congratulations, your Majesty.
- Thank you.
Ready.
- Good?
- Perfect.
Your first war time speech.
Congratulations.
Expect I shall have to do a great deal more.
Thank you, Logue.
Well done, my friend.
Thank you, Your Majesty.
I knew you'd be good.
Thank you, Lionel.
Onwards?
Congratulations, Sir.
Almost did it better then myself, Sir.
Your Majesty, I'm speechless.
Congratulations, Sir.
Gentlemen.
Congratulations, your Majesty.
So how was Papa, Elizabeth?
Halting at first, but you got much better Papa.
Bless you.
- And how about you, Margaret?
- You were just splendid, Papa.
Of course I was.
We all ready?
Come on girls.
Sir?
Thank you.
Let the microphone do the work, sir.
I'm sure you'll be splendid.
Just take your time.
Time to go.
Good afternoon.
This is the BBC National Programme and Empire Service taking you to Wembley Stadium for the closing ceremony of the Empire Exhibition, where His Royal Highness, the Duke of York, will read a message from his father, His Majesty King George V.
Fifty-eight British colonies and dominions have taken part, making this the largest exhibition staged anywhere in the world.
Remember, sir, three flashes, then steady red means you're live.
Using the new invention of radio, the opening ceremony was the first time His Majesty the King addressed his subjects on the wireless.
At the close of the first season, the heir to the throne, His Royal Highness, the Prince of Wales, made his first broadcast, and today, his younger brother, His Royal Highness, the Duke of York,
will give his inaugural broadcast to the nation and the world.
I have received from His Majesty the the the the King...
Inhale deep into your lungs, Your Royal Highness.
Relaxes your larynx, does it not?
Cigarette smoking calms the nerves, and gives you Confidence.
Now, if Your Royal Highness would be so kind as to open your hand.
Sterilized.
One, two, three, four, five, six seven.
Now, if I may take the liberty, insert them into your mouth.
Excuse me, Doctor.
What is the purpose of this?
It's the classic approach.
It cured Demosthenes.
That was in Ancient Greece.
Has it worked since?
Now, if you would be so kind as to read.
"A wealth of words."
Fight against those marbles, Your Royal Highness.
Enunciate.
A little more concentration, Your Royal Highness.
I nearly swallowed the bloody things!
Thank you so much, Doctor.
It's been most, um...
- ...interesting.
- Your Royal Highness.
Insert marbles.
He can insert his own bloody marbles.
Tick, took.
Tick, took.
You know you can't keep doing this, Bertie.
- I know.
- Mmm.
Promise me...
Promise me no more.
Ah!
Hello?
- Is anyone there?
- I'm just in the loo.
Ah, Mrs. Johnson, there you are.
I'm sorry, I don't have a receptionist.
I like to keep things simple.
"Poor and content is rich and rich enough."
- I'm sorry?
- Shakespeare.
How are you?
- How do you do?
- Oh, chuffing along.
Um, now, this is slightly awkward, but I'm afraid you're late.
- Yes.
I'm afraid I am.
- Where's Mr. Johnson?
Ah...
He doesn't know I'm here.
Well, that's not a very promising start.
No.
No, look, my husband has seen everyone.
To no avail.
I'm awfully afraid he's given up hope.
- He hasn't seen me.
- Awfully sure of yourself.
Well, I'm sure of anyone who wants to be cured.
Of course he wants to be cured.
My husband is, um...
- Well, he's required to speak publicly.
- Perhaps he should change jobs.
- He can't.
- Indentured servitude?
Something of that nature, yes.
Well, we need to have your hubby pop by.
Uh...
Tuesday would be good.
He can give me his personal details, I'll make a frank appraisal
- and then we'll take it from there.
- Doctor, forgive me.
Uh, I don't have a "hubby." We don't "pop."
And nor do we ever talk about our private lives.
No, you must come to us.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Johnson, my game, my turf, my rules.
Mmm.
You'll have to talk this over with your husband, and then you can speak to me on the telephone.
Thank you very much for dropping by.
Good afternoon.
And what if my husband were the Duke of York?
- The Duke of York?
- Yes.
The Duke of York.
I thought the appointment was for Johnson.
Forgive me, Your...
- Royal Highness.
- ...
Royal Highness.
Yes, Johnson was used during the Great War, when the Navy didn't want the enemy
- to know he was aboard.
- Am I considered the enemy?
You will be, if you remain un-obliging.
You'll appreciate the need for absolute discretion.
Of course.
How did you find me, Your Royal Highness?
The President of The Society For Speech Therapists.
Eileen McCleod?
She's a sport.
She warned me your Antipodean methods were both "unorthodox" and "controversial."
I warned her those are not my favorite words.
I can cure your husband.
But for my method to work,
I need trust and total equality, here in the safety of my consultation room.
No exceptions.
Oh, well.
In that case...
When can you start?
- She's still sounding a bit rough.
- You make me drive too slowly, Dad.
- Did you pick Mum up from bridge?
- Yeah, I've hardly been out of the car.
I had a special visitor this afternoon.
- May I please leave the table?
- How special's special?
You must stay, bored stupid, listening to your parents' inane conversation.
- Thanks, Dad.
- And Mum.
- And Mum.
- Me, too.
- You meeting Jean?
- No.
Someone else.
- Doctor?
Doctor?
- Hmm?
Go and help your brother with the washing up.
- I'm fine.
- Who is it, Lionel?
Why bring it up if you can't talk about it?
Myrtle, it's just a woman looking to help her husband.
Oh, and I had a call... for an audition.
- One of my favorites.
- Aren't they all?
Could be a lot of fun.
I'm sure you'll be splendid.
In the amateur scene, they're a highly regarded group.
From Putney.
No, that's all girls.
Tomorrow, chapter four, "The Flight."
Mama, I long to know where they fly to.
- I can't wait!
- Oh, to fly away.
Weren't they lucky?
Now Papa, tell a story.
Can't I be a penguin instead?
Well, no, I want a penguin story.
Very quickly.
Once there were...
two princesses.
Princess Elizabeth and Princess Margaret, whose papa was a penguin.
This was because he'd been turned into one by a wicked witch.
This was very inconvenient for him because he loved to hold his princesses in his arms.
But you can't if you're a penguin because you...
- ...you have wings like herrings.
- Herrings don't have wings.
Penguins have wings which are...
are shaped like herrings.
And what made matters worse is that she... she sent him to the South Pole, which is an awfully long walk back if if you can't fly.
So when he reached the water, he he dived in, through the depths, so fast that he was in Southampton Waters by lunchtime.
And from there, he took the 2:30 to Weybridge, changed at Clapham Junction, asked a a passing mallard the way to Buckingham Palace, swam up The Thames, out through the plughole and gave the cook, Mama and Mrs. Whittaker quite a shock.
Now, when the girls heard all the commotion, they ran to the kitchen, where they gave him a a good scrub, a mackerel and a kiss.
And as they kissed him guess what he turned into?
- A handsome prince.
- A short-tailed albatross.
- Oh.
- With wings so big, that he could wrap them both around his two girls together.
Now, girls.
Time for bed.
Come on.
- And take those horses to the stable.
- Quickly, now.
- You have exactly a minute.
- Good night.
Feed them, brush them and to bed.
- Will Mrs. Simpson be there?
- My brother's insisting.
- Is he serious?
- About her coming to dinner?
No.
About her.
- A married woman?
He can't be.
- She can.
By the way, I think I've found someone rather interesting.
On Harley Street.
Doctor.
Out of the question.
I'm not having this conversation again.
Mat...
Matter's settled.
Mmm.
His approach seems rather different.
Now?
Now.
Now is the winter of our discontent, made glorious summer by this sun of York.
And all the clouds that lour'd upon our house in the deep bosom of the ocean buried.
Now are our brows bound with... victorious...
Thank you.
- Lovely diction, Mr...
- Logue.
Lionel Logue.
Well, Mr. Logue,
I'm not hearing the cries of a deformed creature yearning to be king.
Nor did I realize Richard III was King of the Colonies.
I do know all the lines.
I've played the role before.
- Sydney?
- Perth.
Major theater town, is it?
- Enthusiastic.
- Ah.
I was well reviewed.
Yes.
Well, Lionel, I think our dramatic society is looking for someone slightly younger.
And a...
little more regal.
- There you are.
- Thank you.
- Oh.
- Mmm.
No, you have to shut that one first.
Close that one first.
That's it.
Where did you find this... physician?
Classifieds.
Next to a "French model, Shepherd's Market."
No, he comes highly recommended.
Charges substantial fees to help the poor.
Oh, dear.
Perhaps he's a Bolshevik.
Ah, there's no receptionist.
Likes to keep things simple.
Uh...
The Johnsons.
You can go in now, Mr. Johnson.
Lionel says wait here if you wish, Mrs. Johnson.
Or, it being a pleasant day perhaps take a stroll.
Was that all right, Lionel?
Marvelous, Willie.
You can stay here and wait for your mum.
Mrs. Johnson.
Mr. Johnson.
Do come in.
Would you like a sweetie?
He's a good lad, Willie.
He could hardly make a sound, you know, when he first came to me.
My boys make those.
They're good, aren't they?
Please, make yourself comfortable.
I was told not to sit too close.
I believe when speaking with a prince, one waits for the prince to choose the topic.
Waiting for me to...
Ah, yes, well...
Do you know any jokes?
- Timing isn't my strong suit.
- Cup of tea?
- No.
No, thank you.
- I think I'll have one.
Aren't you going to start treating me, Dr. Logue?
Only if you're interested in being treated.
Please, call me Lionel.
No, I... prefer Doctor.
I prefer Lionel.
- What will I call you?
- Your Royal Highness.
Then... it's "sir" after that.
It's a little bit formal for here.
I prefer names.
Prince Albert Frederick Arthur George.
How about Bertie?
- Only my family uses that.
- Perfect.
In here, it's better if we're equals.
If... if we were equals, I wouldn't be here.
I'd be... at home with my wife, and no one would give a damn.
Please, don't do that.
I'm sorry?
I believe sucking smoke into your lungs, well, it will kill you.
My physicians say it relaxes the...
- ...the throat.
- They're idiots.
- They've all been knighted.
- Makes it official, then.
My castle, my rules.
Thank you.
What was your earliest memory?
- What on earth do you mean?
- Your first recollection.
I'm not here to discuss personal matters.
- Well, why are you here, then?
- Because I bloody well stammer!
- You have a bit of a temper.
- One of my many faults.
- When did the defect start?
- I've always been this way.
- I doubt that.
- Don't...
- ...tell me, it's my stammer.
- It's my field.
I can assure you, no infant starts to speak with a stammer.
When did yours start?
- Four or five.
- That's typical.
So I've been told.
I...
I can't remember not doing it.
I can believe that.
Do you hesitate when you think?
- Don't be ridiculous.
- How about when you talk to yourself?
Everyone natters to themselves occasionally, Bertie.
Stop...
Stop calling me that.
I'm not going to call you anything else.
Then we shan't speak.
Are you charging for this, Doctor?
A fortune.
I'll just let that brew.
So... when you talk to yourself, do you stammer?
No... of course not.
Well, that proves that your impediment isn't a permanent part of you.
What do you think was the cause?
I don't... don't know.
I...
I don't...
I don't care.
I...
I stammer.
No one can fix it.
I'll bet you that you can read flawlessly, right here, right now.
And if I win the bet, I get to ask you more questions.
- And if I win?
- You don't have to answer them.
One usually... wagers money.
A bob each to keep it sweet?
- Let's see your shilling.
- I don't... carry money.
I had a funny feeling you mightn't.
I'll stake you, and you can pay me back next time.
- If there is a next time.
- I haven't agreed to take you on yet.
So please stand, uh, and take a look at that.
From there.
I...
I can't read this.
Well, then you owe me a shilling for not trying.
To be or not to be, that...
- Can't read it.
- Uh-uh-uh!
I haven't finished yet.
I'm going to record your voice and then play it back to you on the same machine.
This is brilliant.
it's the latest thing from America.
It's a Silvertone.
Pop these on.
There's a bob in this, mate.
You could go home rich.
- You're playing music!
- I know.
So how can I hear what I'm saying?
Well, surely a prince's brain knows what its mouth's doing?
You're not... well acquainted with royal princes, are you?
Hopeless.
Hopeless!
You were sublime.
Would I lie to a prince of the realm to win 12 pennies?
I've no idea what an Australian might do for that sort of money.
Let me play it back to you.
No.
All right, then, well, I get to ask you the questions.
Thank you, Doctor.
I don't feel this is for me.
Thank you for your time.
Goodbye.
Sir.
The recording is free.
Please keep it as a souvenir.
No.
Oh, well.
Bugger.
For the present, the work to which we are all equally bound is to arrive at a reasoned tranquility within our borders, to regain prosperity at this time of depression without self-seeking, and to carry with us those whom the burden of the past years
has disheartened or overborne.
To all, to each, I wish a happy Christmas.
God bless you.
And off air.
Easy when you know how.
Sir?
Have a go yourself.
- Congratulations, sir.
- Ah, Mr. Wood.
Splendid fellow.
Chap who taught me everything I know.
- Let the microphone do the work.
- Sir.
- Thank you.
- Gentlemen.
Sit up.
Straight back.
Face boldly up to the bloody thing and stare it square in the eye, as would any decent Englishman.
Show who's in command.
Papa, I don't... think I can read this.
This devilish device will change everything if you don't.
In the past, all a king had to do was look respectable in uniform and not fall off his horse.
Now, we must invade people's homes and ingratiate ourselves with them.
This family's been reduced to those lowest, basest of all creatures.
We've become actors.
We're not a family, We're a firm.
Yet at any moment, some of us may be out of work.
Your darling brother and future king, the only wife he appears interested in is invariably the wife of another.
- He's broken off with Lady Furness.
- And taken up with Mrs. Simpson.
A woman with two husbands living.
I told him straight.
No divorced person can ever be received at court.
He said it made him sublimely happy.
I imagine that was because she was sleeping with him.
"I give you my word," this is what he said.
"I give you my word, we've never had immoral relations."
Stared square into his father's face and lied.
When I'm dead, that boy will ruin himself, this family and this nation within 12 months.
Who will pick up the pieces, hmm?
Herr Hitler intimidating half of Europe.
Marshal Stalin the other half.
Who will stand between us, the jackboots and the proletarian abyss?
You?
Well?
With your older brother shirking his duties, you're going to have to do a lot more of this.
Have a go yourself.
Through the...
- ...wireless...
- Get it out, boy.
...one of the marvels of...
"Modern." Just take your time.
Form your words carefully.
...science I am enabled...
Relax.
Just try it!
...this Christmas Day to speak to all my...
Do it!
Who's Been Polishing the Sun?
Lying... bastard.
- You're playing music.
- I know.
So how can I...
hear what I'm saying?
Well, surely a prince's brain knows what its mouth's doing.
You're not... well acquainted with royal princes, are you?
"To be or not be, that is the question.
Whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, or to take arms against a sea of troubles, and by opposing end them?
To die, to sleep no more, and by a sleep to say the end is the heartache and the thousand natural shocks the flesh is heir to.
Tis a consummation hopeless. "
Hopeless!
Strictly business.
No...
- ...personal nonsense.
- Yes, I thought I'd made that clear
- in our interview.
- Have you got the shilling you owe me?
- No, I haven't.
- Didn't think so.
Besides, you... you tricked me.
Physical exercises and tricks are important, but what you're asking will only deal with the surface of the problem.
Is that sufficient?
Uh, no.
As far as I see it, my husband has mechanical difficulties with his speech.
- I...
- Maybe just deal with that.
- I'm willing to work hard, Dr. Logue.
- Lionel.
Are you...
Are you willing to do your part?
All right.
You want mechanics?
We need to relax your jaw muscles, strengthen your tongue, by repeating tongue twisters.
For example, "I'm a thistle-sifter.
I have a sieve of sifted thistles and a sieve of unsifted thistles.
- Because I am a thistle-sifter."
- Fine.
And you do have a flabby tummy, so we'll need to spend some time strengthening your diaphragm.
Simple mechanics.
- That's all we ask.
- All that's about a shilling's worth.
Forget about the blessed shilling!
Perhaps, upon occasions you might be requested to assist in coping with with some minor event.
Would that be agreeable?
Of course.
Yes, and that would be the full extent of your services.
- Shall I see you next week?
- I shall see you every day.
Feel the looseness of the jaw.
Good.
Little bounces.
Bounces.
Shoulders loose, shoulders loose.
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful.
Now, loose.
Take a nice deep breath.
Expand the chest.
Put your hands onto your ribs.
Deeper.
Good.
- How do you feel?
- Full of hot air.
Isn't that what public speakings all about?
My wife and I are glad to visit this important...
Take a good deep breath, and up comes Your Royal Highness.
And slowly exhale, and down comes Your Royal Highness.
- You all right, Bertie?
- Yes.
It's actually quite good fun.
Mmm...
Mother.
Shorten the humming each time.
Mother.
Mmm...
- ...manufacturing district...
- Another deep breath.
- And Jack and Jill.
- Jack and Jill.
- Went up the hill.
- Went up the hill.
Now, just sway.
Perfect.
- ...will not permit us to...
- Loosen the shoulders.
Ding dong bell, pussy's in the well.
Who put her in?
Little Tommy Tin.
You have a short memory, Bertie.
Come on.
- A cow, a cow...
- A king.
A... a king...
Anyone who can shout vowels at an open window can learn to deliver a speech.
- Fourteen, 15!
- Good.
Deep breath, and...
It is...
- Let the words flow.
- No, it doesn't bloody work.
Come on, one more time, Bertie.
You can do it.
A sieve of thisted siphles.
Gah!
Mah!
Bah!
Father.
- Father.
- Father.
- Aim for the a-t-h.
- Father.
- Father.
- Father.
Father.
Father.
- Hello, Bertie.
- Hello, David.
- Nice of you to come out.
- Not at all.
You been waiting long?
Christ, bloody freezing.
Where have you been?
- I've been busy.
- So have I.
- Elizabeth has pneumonia.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- She'll recover.
- Father won't.
I'll drive.
Old bugger's doing this on purpose.
- Dying?
- Departing prematurely.
To...
To complicate matters with Wallis.
For heaven's sake, David.
You know how long he's been ill.
Wallis explained.
She's terribly clever about these things.
Whereas my letters patent under the Great Seal bearing date of Westminster the 11th day of June 1912,
His Majesty King George the Fifth did constitute order and declare that there should be a Guardian...
- What's going on here?
- ...custos regne...
I cannot follow you.
I'm confused and I don't understand... it's the Order of the Council of State, sir.
So that we may act on your behalf much clearer to me, I'm afraid...
- Well, I'm so confused that...
- Approved.
Thank you.
- Let me help you, sir.
- Ah, yes...
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.
- Feeling a little better, sir?
- No, I'm not feeling any better.
I feel dreadful.
Ah...
Been, uh, ice skating?
Ice skating?
No.
No, George.
Yes.
Yes, all right, of course.
I know, darling.
A talk, even a lovely long talk is a poor substitute for holding tight and making drowsy.
Nor making our own drowsies either, as we've had to do too often lately.
- David.
Dinner.
- I'm on with Wallis.
It's Bertie.
No.
No, it's not important.
I don't want to.
No.
Telephone me later?
All right, goodbye.
- Wallis misses me terribly.
- Mama says you're late for dinner.
She forgets Papa's bloody clocks are all half an hour fast.
How's the King?
I...
I hope he's not in pain.
No, no, sir.
His Majesty's quieter now.
Thank you.
David, if your father were here, tardiness would not be tolerated.
None of this unpleasantness would be tolerated.
You know, sir, I appreciate that you are different from your father, both in outlook and... temperament.
I want you to know that whenever the King questioned your conduct,
I tried, in your interest, to present it in the most favorable light.
Mmm.
I can always trust you to have my best interests at heart.
I fear our vigil will not be of long duration.
Please continue.
Let us commend our brother George to the mercy of God, our Maker and Redeemer.
Long live the King.
I hope I will make good as he has made good.
- What on earth was that?
- Poor Wallis.
Now, I'm trapped.
And in these last 25 crowded, troubled, glorious years, if there is one thing that King George has taught, it is the art of the leader who is also e brother to his followers.
As long as he lived, he was the guiding star of a great nation.
- Dad?
- Mmm-hmm?
- When he died...
- Time for a Shake, Dad?
...the little children cried in the streets.
- You sure?
- Go on.
Put your thinking caps on.
- I bet it's the Scottish play.
- No, it's Othello. it's always Othello.
Art thou afeard?
- Be not afeard.
- Caliban.
Oh, for heaven's sake.
That was a lucky guess.
Don't listen to egghead.
Go on, Dad.
The isle is full of noises, sounds and sweet airs that give delight, and hurt not.
Sometimes a thousand twangling instruments will hum about mine ears, and sometimes voices, that, if then I had waked after long sleep, will make me sleep again.
All right, clever clogs, so what comes next?
And then, in dreaming, methought the clouds would...
- The clouds methought.
- The clouds methought would open, and show riches ready to drop upon me, that when I waked, I cried to dream again.
That's such a sad thought.
My next patient must be a bit early.
You better go, lads, I'm sorry.
Won't be a moment, Clifford.
Bertie?
They told me not to expect you.
I'm sorry about your father.
- I don't wish to intrude.
- Not at all.
Please, come in.
Come in.
I've been practicing.
An hour a day.
In spite of everything.
What's going on there?
Oh, I was...
Sorry.
Mucking around with my kids.
Do you feel like working today?
- Curtis biplane.
- I'll put on some hot milk.
Logue.Logue.
I'd kill for something stronger.
I wasn't there for my father's death.
- Still makes me sad.
- I can imagine so.
- What did your father do?
- He was a brewer.
At least there was free beer.
Here's to the memory of your father.
I was informed, after the fact, that my father's...
My father's last words were "Bertie has more guts than the rest of his brothers put together."
Couldn't say that to my face.
My brother.
What about him?
Try singing it.
- I'm sorry?
- What songs do you know?
- Songs?
- Yeah, songs.
- Swanee Riven
- I love that song.
- It happens to be my favorite.
- Sing me the chorus.
No.
Certainly not.
You know...
I always wanted to build models.
But...
Father wouldn't allow it.
He... collected stamps, so we had to collect stamps.
You can finish that off if you sing.
My brother David Dum, dum, dum, dum...
- I'm not going to sit here warbling.
- You can with me.
- Because you're peculiar.
- I take that as a compliment.
Well...
Rules are rules.
I'm not... crooning Swanee Riven
Camptown Races, then.
J' My brother David said to me
Doo-dah, doo-dah
- Continuous sound will give you flow.
- No.
Does it feel strange now that David's on the throne?
To tell the truth, it was a relief.
Knowing I wouldn't be...
King.
But unless he produces an heir, you're next in line.
And your daughter, Elizabeth, would then succeed you.
You're barking up the wrong tree now, Doctor, Doctor
Lionel
See?
You didn't stammer.
Of course I didn't stammer, I was singing.
Well, as a little reward, you get to put some glue on these struts.
- Your boy... won't mind?
- No, not at all.
David and I were... very close.
Young bucks, you know.
Did you chase the same girls?
David was always very helpful in... arranging introductions.
We shared the expert ministrations of Paulette in the Palace.
Not at the same time, of course.
- Did David ever tease you?
- Oh, yes, they all did.
"B-B-B-Bertie."
Father encouraged it.
Said, "Get it out, boy!" Said it would make me stop.
He said, "l was afraid of my father and my children are...
damn well gonna be afraid of me!"
Are you naturally right-handed?
Left.
I was... punished, and now I use the right.
Yes, that's very common with stammerers.
- Any other corrections?
- Knock knees.
Metal splints were made.
Worn... worn day and night.
- Must have been painful.
- Bloody agony.
Straight legs now.
Who were you closest to in your family?
Nannies.
Not my first nanny.
She...
She loved David.
Hated me.
When we were presented to my parents for the daily viewing, she would... she'd pinch me so that I'd cry and be handed back to her immediately.
And then she would...
Sing it.
Then she wouldn't feed me
Far, far away
Took my parents...
three years to notice.
As you... as you can imagine, caused some stomach problems.
Still.
What about your brother, Johnnie?
Were you close to him?
Johnnie... sweet boy.
Had epilepsy.
And he was... different.
He died at... 13.
Hidden from view.
I'm...
I'm told it's not... catching.
Do you want a top-up?
Please.
You know Lionel, you're you're the first ordinary Englishman...
- Australian.
- ...
I've ever really spoken to.
When I'm... driven through the streets and I see the, you know, the common man staring at me, I I'm struck by how little I know of his life and how little he knows of mine.
- Thank you.
- What are friends for?
I wouldn't know.
I sifted seven thick-stalked thistles through a strong, thick sieve.
- I sifted seven thick-stalked...
- That's enough now, darling.
Listen, I have to keep doing this, it's awful.
I sifted seven...
- Oh, no.
- ...thick-stalked...
One-hundred-year-old spruces removed to improve the view?
Who does she think she is?
Nonetheless, we must try to be pleasant towards Mrs. Simpson.
- She calls me "The Fat Scottish Cook."
- You're not fat.
I'm getting plump.
Well, you seldom cook.
- I sifted seven...
- Shut up.
...thick sieves...
I sifted seven...
Three, two, one and...
Their Royal Highnesses the Duke and Duchess of York.
Oh, how lovely to see you both.
Welcome to our little country shack.
I came at the invitation of the King.
Your Majesty.
- You all right?
- Sorry we're late.
Very nice to see you...
Mrs. Simpson.
Very nice.
Hello, David.
Making some changes to the garden, I see.
Yes, I'm not quite finished yet.
Don't tell me I behaved badly, Mr. Churchill.
On the contrary, Your Royal Highness.
Etiquette decrees that royalty should be greeted by the official host, in this case, the King.
Not a commoner.
Thank you.
- What is her hold on him?
- I've no idea.
Apparently, she has certain skills acquired in an establishment in Shanghai.
David.
Just be a sec, darling.
Would you excuse me?
- David, I've been trying to see you.
- I've been terribly busy.
- Doing what?
- Kinging.
Really?
Kinging is a a precarious business these days.
Where's the Russian tsar?
- Where's cousin Wilhelm?
- You're being dreary.
Ls kinging laying off 80... staff and buying more pearls for Wallis, while people are marching across Europe singing The Red Flag?
- Herr Hitler will sort them out.
- Who will sort out Herr Hitler?
Where's the bloody 23?
And you put that woman in our mother's suite!
- Mama's not still in the bed, is she?
- That's not funny.
Here it is.
Wallis likes the very best.
I don't care what woman you carry on with at night, as long as you... show up for duty in the morning.
Wallis is not just some woman I'm carrying on with.
We intend to marry.
- Excuse me?
- She's filing a petition for divorce.
Good God.
Can't you just give her a nice house and a title?
- I'm not having her as my mistress.
- The Church doesn't recognize divorce,
- and you are the... head of the Church.
- Haven't I any rights?
- Many privileges.
- Not the same thing.
Your beloved common man may marry for love.
Why not me?
If you were... a common man, on what basis could you...
possibly claim to be King?
Sounds like you've studied our wretched Constitution.
- Sounds like you haven't.
- That's what this is about.
Brushing up.
Hence, the elocution lessons.
- That's the scoop around town.
- I'm trying to...
Yearning for a larger audience, are we, B-B-Bertie?
Don't...
What's that?
I'm sorry, I...
Younger brother trying to push older brother off the throne.
P-P-Positively mediaeval.
Wallis.
Ah.
Where have you been all this time?
- Who have you been talking to?
- Never you mind.
What a very complicated little King you are.
I try to be.
All that work... down the drain.
My own brother.
I couldn't say a single word to him in reply.
Why do you stammer so much more with David than you ever do with me?
Because you're bloody well paid to listen.
- Bertie, I'm not a geisha girl.
- Stop trying to be so bloody clever.
What is it about David that stops you speaking?
What is it about you that bloody well makes you want to go on about him
-the whole bloody time?
- Vulgar but fluent.
- You don't stammer when you swear.
- Bugger off!
- ls that the best you can do?
- Well, bloody bugger to you, you beastly bastard.
Oh, a public school prig could do better than that.
Shit.
Shit, Shit, Shit.
Shit, Shit, Shit, Shit, Shit, Shit!
Yes, defecation flows trippingly from the tongue.
- Because I'm angry!
- Do you know the "f" word?
- Fornication?
- Oh, Bertie.
Fuck.
Fuck!
Fuck, fuck, fuckin' fuck!
Fuck, fuck and bugger!
Bugger, bugger, buggedy, fuck!
- Fuck, ass!
- Yes!
- Balls, balls, fuckety shit.
- You see?
Not a hesitation.
Willy, shit and fuck!
And tits.
- Dad, what's going on?
- Sorry.
Just finish your homework.
Well, that's a side of you we don't get to see all that often.
No.
No, we're not supposed to, really.
Not publicly.
- Let's get some air.
- No, I don't think that's a good idea.
What's the matter?
Why are you so upset?
Logue, you have no idea.
My... my brother is infatuated with a woman who's been married twice.
She's asking for a divorce, and he's determined to marry her.
- Jesus.
- Mrs. Wallis Simpson
- of Baltimore.
- That's not right.
- Queen Wallis of Baltimore.
- Unthinkable.
- Can he do it?
- Absolutely not.
But he's going to anyway.
All hell's broken loose.
- Can't they just carry on privately?
- If only they would.
Where does this leave you?
I know my place.
I...
I...
I will do anything in my power to keep my brother on the throne.
Is it that serious?
- Your place may well be on the throne.
- I am not an alternative to my brother.
- You can outshine David.
- Don't take liberties!
- That's bordering on treason.
- I'm just saying you could be King.
- You could do it.
- That is treason.
I'm trying to get you to realize you needn't be governed by fear.
I've had enough of this.
- What are you so afraid of?
- Your poisonous words!
Why did you come to me?
You're not some middle-class banker who wants elocution lessons so you can chitchat...
Don't attempt to instruct me on my duties!
I am the son of a...
King.
And the brother of... of a King.
You're the disappointing son of a brewer.
A jumped-up jackeroo from the outback.
You're a nobody.
These sessions are over.
Through here, sir.
It's not because she's an American.
That is the least of it.
It's because she's a soon to be twice divorced American.
And the King, as head of the Church of England, cannot marry a divorced woman.
And, sir, I apologize for the nature of this.
According to Scotland Yard, the King has not always possessed exclusive rights to Mrs. Simpson's...
favors and affections sharing them with a married used car salesman, a certain Mr. Guy Trundle.
In addition, it is also rumored Hitler's ambassador,
Count von Ribbentrop, sends her 17 carnations every day.
Should His Majesty continue to ignore the advice of his government, he must abdicate.
Otherwise, his government has no choice but to resign.
Prime Minister, you'd leave a country without a a government?
Does the King do what he wants?
Or does he do what the people expect him to do?
As crowds in Downing Street watch ministers come and go, can a king separate his personal life
- from his public duty...
- What's the matter, love?
I'm just having trouble with a patient.
That isn't like you.
- Why?
- He's scared.
He's afraid of his own shadow.
Isn't that why they come to you?
This fellow could really be somebody great.
He's fighting me.
Perhaps he doesn't want to be great.
Perhaps that's what you want.
I might have overstepped the mark.
Apologize.
Do you both good.
I'm very sorry, Mr. Logue, the Duke is busy.
I'm happy to wait.
Or I could come back later.
As I said, the Duke is terribly busy.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Parliament will not support the marriage.
But there are other reasons for concern.
He was careless with state papers.
He lacked commitment and resolve, and there are those who are worried about where he will stand when war comes with Germany.
- We're not coming to that?
- Indeed we are, sir.
Prime Minister Baldwin may deny this, but Hitler's intent is crystal clear.
War with Germany will come.
And we will need a King whom we can all stand behind, united.
I fear my brother is not of sound mind at this time.
Have you thought what you will call yourself?
Hmm?
Certainly not Albert, sir.
Too Germanic.
What about George?
After your father?
George the Sixth has a rather nice continuity to it.
Don't you think?
David.
Thank God.
You look exhausted.
How are you bearing up?
Bertie, the decision's been made.
I...
I'm going.
- I can't accept that...
- I'm afraid there's no other way.
I must marry her.
My mind's made up.
I'm... sorry.
That's a terrible thing to hear.
Nobody wants that.
I, least of all.
At long last,
I am able to say a few words of my own.
I have never wanted to withhold anything, but until now it has not been constitutionally possible for me to speak.
A few hours ago, I discharged my last duty as King and Emperor, and now that I have been succeeded by my brothel;
the Duke of York, my first words must be to declare my allegiance to him.
This I do with all my heart.
You all know the reasons which have impelled me to renounce the throne, but you must believe me when I tell you that I have found it impossible to carry the heavy burden of responsibility and to discharge my duties as King,
as I would wish to do without the help and support of the woman I love.
And I want you to know, this decision has been made less difficult to me by the sure knowledge that my brother, with his long training in the public affairs of this country, and with his fine qualities,
will be able to take my place forthwith without interruption or injury to the life and progress of the Empire.
I meet you today in in circumstances which are...
- I'm sure you'll love it.
- There you go.
Thank you, darling.
Saddles.
Margaret.
- There's Montezuma.
- Oh, here's one.
- Mama, here's a horse and saddle.
- Thank you.
Oops.
- Don't worry, Sally.
We'll get you...
- Mama?
- Yes?
- Will we have space for our horses
- in our new home?
- Course we will, darling.
We'll have a palace of rooms.
Curtsey.
Your Majesty.
How was it?
I was trying to...
familiarize myself with... what a state paper looks like.
It's a dispatch from Mr. Baldwin, which I don't understand a word of.
David's finances.
Christmas... broadcast.
- Think that would be a mistake.
- No, don't worry about that.
Oh.
Plans for the Coronation.
Think that would be an even bigger mistake.
- I'm not a King.
- Oh, shush.
I'm a Naval officer.
That's all I know.
I'm not a King.
I'm not a King.
- I'm sorry.
- No.
- I'm sorry.
- No, don't be silly.
Please.
Oh, my dear.
My dear, dear man.
- I'm sorry.
- You know,
I refused your first two marriage proposals, not because I didn't love you, but because I couldn't bear the idea of a Royal life.
Couldn't bear the idea of a life of tours, public duty, of...
Well, a life that no longer was really to be my own.
But then I thought, he stammers so beautifully, they'll leave us alone.
Waiting for a King to apologize, one can wait rather a long wait.
I'm afraid we're slightly late.
This is home.
Myrtle's at bridge.
I made sure the boys were out.
It's lovely.
Absolutely lovely.
- Oh!
May I sit down?
- Yes, of course.
- Would you like some tea, ma'am?
- Yes, I'll help myself.
Now, off you go.
Or must I knock your heads together?
Here's your shilling.
I understand what you were trying to say, Logue.
I went about it the wrong way.
I'm sorry.
So, here I am.
Is the nation ready for two...
minutes of radio silence?
Every stammerer always fears going back to square one.
I don't let that happen.
If I fail in my duty,
David could come back.
I've seen the placards.
"God save our...
King."
They don't mean me.
Every monarch in history has succeeded someone who's dead or just about to be.
My predecessor is not only alive, but very much so.
It's a bloody mess.
Couldn't even give them a Christmas speech.
- Like your dad used to do?
- Precisely.
He's not here anymore.
Yes, he is.
He's on that shilling I gave you.
Easy enough to give away.
You don't have to carry him around in your pocket.
Or your brother.
You don't need to be afraid of the things you were afraid of when you were five.
You're very much your own man, Bertie.
Am I?
- Your face is next, mate.
- Lionel, dear!
Myrtle.
- Is this your wife?
- Yes.
Bertie.
Come here.
- Are you all right, Logue?
- Yes.
- Shouldn't we go through?
- Trust me, it's important.
- What is it?
- Oh!
- You're...
- It's "Your Majesty" the first time.
After that, it's "Ma'am." As in "ham."
Not "malm" as in "palm."
I haven't told her about us.
Sit down, relax.
I'm told your husband calls my husband Bertie.
And my husband calls your husband Lionel.
I trust you won't call me Liz.
Your Majesty, you may call me Mrs. Logue, ma'am.
Very nice to meet you, Mrs. Logue.
- Logue, we can't stay here all day.
- Yes, we can.
- Logue!
- I need to wait for the right moment.
- Logue, you're being a coward.
- You're damn right.
Get out there, man.
Hello, Myrtle, darling.
You're early.
I believe you two have met, but I don't think you know...
- ...
King George the Sixth.
- It's very nice to meet you.
Will Their Majesties be staying to dinner?
We'd love to, such a treat, but alas a previous engagement.
What a pity.
- Archbishop.
- Welcome, Your Majesty.
What a glorious transformation, sir.
I hope you'll forgive us if we continue our preparations?
Now, allow me to guide you through the ceremony.
We begin, of course, at the West door into the nave.
I see all your pronouncements are to be broadcast, Archbishop.
Ah, yes.
Wireless.
It is, indeed, a Pandora's box, and I'm afraid I've also had to permit the newsreel cameras.
The product of which I shall personally edit.
Without momentary hesitations.
This is Dr. Logue of Harley Street.
He's... my speech therapist.
- Your Grace.
- Had I known that Your Majesty was seeking assistance, I should have made my own recommendation.
Dr. Logue will will be attending the Coronation.
Of course I'll speak to the Dean, but it will be extremely difficult.
I should like the doctor to be seated in the King's Box.
But members of your family will be seated there, sir.
That is why it is suitable.
And now, if you don't mind, Your Grace, we need the premises.
My dear fellow, this is Westminster Abbey.
The Church must prepare His Majesty.
My preparations are equally as important.
With complete privacy, if you don't mind.
Those are my wishes, Your Grace.
I will place the Abbey at Your Majesty's disposal, this evening.
Your Majesty.
I can't believe I'm walking on Chaucer and Handel and Dickens.
Everything all right?
Let's get cracking.
I'm not here to rehearse, Dr. Logue.
Call me Lionel.
True, you... never called yourself Doctor.
I did that for you.
No training.
No diploma, no qualifications
Just... a great deal of nerve.
The Star Chamber inquisition, is it?
You asked for trust.
And... total equality.
Bertie, I heard you at Wembley.
I was there.
My son Laurie said, "Dad, do you think you could help that poor man?"
- What, as a failed actor?
- it's true.
I'm not a doctor.
And yes, I acted, a bit.
Well, I recited in pubs.
I taught elocution in schools.
When the Great War came, all our soldiers were returning to Australia from the front, a lot of them shell-shocked, unable to speak.
Somebody said, Lionel, "You're very good at this speech stuff.
Do you think you could possibly help these poor buggers?"
I did muscle therapy, exercises, relaxation, but I knew I had to go deeper.
Those poor young blokes had cried out in fear.
No one was listening to them.
My job was to give them faith in their own voice, and let them know that a friend was listening.
That must ring a few bells with you, Bertie.
You give a very noble account of yourself.
- Make inquiries.
It's all true.
- Inquiries have been made.
You have no idea who I have breathing down my neck.
I vouched for you, and you have no...
- ...credentials.
- But lots of success.
I can't show you a certificate.
There was no training then.
Everything I know, I know from experience.
And that war was some experience.
My plaque says, "L. Logue, Speech Defects."
Not "Doctor." There are no letters after my name.
- Lock me in the Tower.
- I would if I could.
- On what charge?
- Fraud.
With war looming, you've saddled this nation with a voiceless King.
You've destroyed the happiness of my family, all for the sake of ensnaring a star... patient you couldn't possibly hope to assist.
It'll be like mad King George the Third.
I'll be...
Mad King George the Stammerer who let his people down so badly in their hour of need.
What are you doing?
Get up!
You can't sit there!
Get up!
- Why not?
it's a chair.
- No, it...
That is not a chair!
That is...
That...
- That is Saint Edward's chair.
- People have carved their names on it.
That chair is the seat on which every King...
- It's held in place by a large rock.
- That is the Stone of Scone!
- You are trivializing everything.
- I don't care how many royal assholes
- have sat on this chair.
- Listen to me!
Listen to me!
- Listen to you?
By what right?
- By Divine Right, if you must.
- I am your King!
- No, you're not.
You told me so yourself.
You said you didn't want it.
Why should I waste my time listening to you?
Because I have a right to be heard!
I have a voice!
Yes, you do.
You have such perseverance, Bertie.
You're the bravest man I know.
You'll make a bloody good King.
- What on earth is going on, sir?
- It's quite all right, Archbishop.
Mr. Logue, you must know that
I've found a replacement English specialist with impeccable credentials.
Hence, your services will no longer be required.
- I'm sorry?
- Your Majesty's function is to consult and be advised.
Now, you didn't consult,
- but you have just been advised.
- And now I advise you.
In this personal matter, I will make my own decision.
My concern is for the head on which I must place the crown.
I appreciate that, Archbishop.
But it's my head.
Your humble servant.
Thank you, Bertie.
Shall we rehearse?
Come on.
Up on your perch.
Now, when you and Elizabeth enter through the West door, you will be greeted by the hymn "I was glad when they said unto me."
Actually, you won't be that glad because they do sing it for a very long time.
Then your friend, the Archbishop, will ponce up the stairs towards you, and say, "Sir, is Your Majesty willing to take the oath?"
- "l am willing."
- Well, of course you are.
I'm gonna see what this sounds like in the cheap seats, so even your old nanny can hear.
"Will you govern your peoples, Great Britain, Ireland, Canada,
Australia and New Zealand, according to their lands and customs?"
- "l solemnly promise to do so."
- Louder.
- I can't hear you up the back.
- "I solemnly promise to do so."
Very good. "And will you, to your power, cause Law and Justice, in Mercy to be executed in all your judgments?"
"I will.
I will!"
Then there's a very long bit about upholding the faith.
It goes on, rubbish, rubbish, rubbish, to which you finally say...
"The things which I have...
here before promised,
I will perform and keep.
So help me God."
And that's all you say.
Four short responses.
Kiss the book, sign the oath, and you're King.
Easy.
You nearly crowned him backwards, Archbishop.
Someone had removed the thread marking the back of the crown, sir.
Try not to lose the thread, Archbishop.
Archbishop, we're missing Papa.
- God save the King.
- Very good.
Very good, Archbishop.
Well, I hope Your Majesties are thrilled with the result.
- You can switch that machine off.
- No, wait.
Keep going.
- Nazism has held its great convention.
- Do take a seat, Archbishop.
Masses of uniformed men, stupefying to the eye, and incredible to the imagination have stood in spellbound audience of the Fuhrer.
- Papa?
Papa, what's he saying?
- Hmm?
I don't know, but he seems to be saying it rather well.
Sir...
I have asked to see you today in order to tender my resignation as Prime Minister.
I'm so sorry to hear that, Mr. Baldwin.
Neville Chamberlain will take my place as Prime Minister.
It's a matter of principle.
I was mistaken.
I have found it impossible to believe that there is any man in the world so lacking in moral feeling as Hitler, that the world may be hurled for a second time into the abyss of destructive war.
Churchill was right all along.
This was always Hitler's intention.
I'm only very sorry to leave you at this great time of crisis.
I'm very much afraid, sir, that your greatest test is yet to come.
I am speaking to you from the Cabinet room at 10 Downing Street.
This morning, the British ambassador in Berlin handed the German government a final note stating that unless we heard from them by 11:00, that they were prepared at once to withdraw their troops from Poland, a state of war would exist between us.
I have to tell you now that no such undertaking has been received, and that, consequently, this country is at war with Germany.
At last, sir, here is your speech.
You are on air at six.
I have timed it to just under nine minutes.
The wording is fully approved.
The Prime Minister will be joining you for the broadcast, which will go outlive across the nation, the Empire
- and to our armed forces.
- Get Logue here immediately.
- There's the barrage balloons.
- Yes.
- They got them up there quickly.
- Yeah.
- Shall we pull over and find a shelter?
- No, no.
Go straight there.
We'll be all right.
- Yes, sir?
- Lionel Logue.
Major Hartley is expecting me.
This is my son, Laurie.
- Thank you, Laurie.
- Good luck, Dad.
- The King's speech.
- Thank you, sir.
We have about 40 minutes to the broadcast.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
There may be dark days ahead...
- ...and...
- Try again.
There may be dark days ahead, and...
Turn the hesitations into pauses and say to yourself, "God save the King."
I say that continuously, but apparently no one's listening.
Long pauses are good.
They add solemnity to great occasions.
Then I'm the solemnest king who ever lived.
You know, if I'm a king, where's my power?
Can I... can I form a government?
Can I... can I...
levy a tax?
Declare a... a war?
No.
And yet I'm the seat of all authority.
Why?
Because the nation believes that when I...
I speak,
I speak for them.
But I can't speak.
Let's take it all again from the top.
"In this grave hour."
In this grave hour...
Fuck, fuck, fuck.
Perhaps the most fateful in our history...
Bugger, shit, shit.
I send to every household of my...
You see, "P" is always difficult, even when I'm singing.
Bounce on to it. "A peoples."
A people.
A people.
Household of my peoples, both at home
- and overseas.
- Beautiful.
This message...
Doo-dah
Spoken with the same depth of feeling Doo-dah day
For each one of you, as if I were able to...
Shit, fuck, bugger!
...cross your threshold and speak to you...
In your head now. "I have a right to be bloody well heard."
Bloody well heard, bloody well heard myself!
Now, waltz.
Move.
Get continuous movement.
For the second time in the lives of most of us
- We are at...
- "We are," take a pause.
- Lionel, I can't do this.
- Bertie, you can do it.
- Have a look at the last paragraph.
- Bertie. it's time.
- Archbishop.
- Your Majesty.
A great moment, sir.
- Prime Minister.
- Your Majesty.
Nice to see you... again so soon.
Good of you to be here.
I'm sure you have a...
- ...a rather busy day.
- I hope we have no more interruptions
-from those damn sirens, sir.
- Or the wretched dogs.
Congrat...
Congratulations.
- First Lord of the Admiralty.
- Your Majesty.
The long... walk.
Good luck, sir.
I, too, dread this apparatus.
Had a speech impediment myself, you know.
- I didn't.
- Family secret.
Tongue-tied.
An operation was considered to be too dangerous.
I eventually made an asset of it.
- Thank you, Mr. Churchill.
- Sir.
Darling.
- How long, Logue?
- Just under three minutes.
- Mr. Wood.
- Good luck, Your Majesty.
Mr. Wood.
- You've redecorated, Logue.
- I made it cozy.
- Some fresh air.
- There you are, darling.
I'm a thistle-sifter.
I've a sieve of sifted thistles and a sieve of unsifted thistles.
A sieve of sifted thistles and a sieve of unsifted thistles.
- Because I'm...
- Bertie.
Darling.
Make sure it's not switched on.
Remember, the red light will blink four times, then I've asked them to turn it off.
'Cause we don't want that evil eye staring at you all the way through.
One minute, sir.
I'm sure you'll be splendid.
Forty seconds, sir.
Logue.
However this turns out I don't know how to thank you...
for what you've done.
Knighthood?
Twenty seconds.
Forget everything else, and just say it to me.
Say it to me as a friend.
In this grave... ..hour..
...perhaps the most fateful in our history I send to every household of my a-peoples both at home and overseas this message spoken with the same depth of feeling for each one of you as if I were able to cross your threshold
and speak to you... myself.
For the second time in the lives of most of us we are... at...
Fuck, fuck, fuck!
...at war.
Very good.
Over and over again we have tried to find a peaceful way out of the differences between ourselves and those who are now our... enemies.
But it has been... in vain.
We have been forced into a conflict, for we are called to meet the challenge of a principle, which, if it were to prevail, would be fatal to any civilized order in the world.
Such a principle, stripped of all disguise,
is surely the mere primitive doctrine that might is right.
For the sake of all that we ourselves hold dean it is unthinkable that we should refuse to meet the challenge.
It is to this high purpose that I now call my people at home, and my peoples across the seas, who will make our cause their own.
I ask them to stand calm and firm and united in this time of trial.
The task will be hard.
There may be dark days ahead, and war can no longer be confined to the battlefield.
But we can only do the right as we see the right, and reverently commit our cause to God.
If one and all we keep resolutely faithful to it, then, with God's help,
we shall... prevail.
It was very good, Bertie.
You still stammered on the 'w'
Well, I had to throw in a few, so they knew it was me.
Congratulations, Your Majesty.
A true broadcaster.
Thank you, Mr. Wood.
- Congratulations, Your Majesty.
- Sir.
- Congratulations, Your Majesty.
- Thank you.
Ready.
- Good?
- Perfect, sir.
Your first wartime speech.
Congratulations.
I expect I shall have to...
do a great deal more.
Thank you, Logue.
Well done.
My friend.
Thank you Your Majesty.
I knew you'd be good.
Thank you...
Lionel.
Onwards.
- Congratulations, sir.
- Well done, sir.
Couldn't have said it better myself, sir.
Your Majesty, I am speechless.
- Congratulations, sir.
- Gentlemen.
- So how was Papa, Elizabeth?
- Halting at first,
- but you got much better, Papa.
- Well, bless you.
- And how about you, Margaret?
- You were just splendid, Papa.
Of course I was.
Are we all ready?
Come on, girls.
You are live in two minutes, Your Royal Highness.
Sir?
At the microphone, do your work Sir.
I am sure you will be splendid.
Just take your time.
Time to go.
Good afternoon.
This is the BBC National Programme and Empire Services taking you to Wembley Stadium for the Closing Ceremony of the Empire Exhibition.
where His Royal Highness, the Duke of York, will read a message from His Father:
His Majesty, King George V.
58 British Colonies and Dominions have taken part, making this the largest Exhibition staged anywhere in the world.
Remember Sir, three flashes;
then steady "red" means you are live.
Using the new invention of radio,
The Opening Ceremony was the first time his Majesty the King addressed his subjects on the wireless.
At the close of the first season,
The heir to the throne, His Royal Highness, the Prince of Wales, made his first broadcast
And today, his younger brother, His Royal Highness, the Duke of York will give his inaugural broadcast to the nation and the world.
I have received... from his Majesty... the K-K-K...
The King.
Inhale deep into your lungs...
Your Royal Highness.
Relaxes your larynx, does it not?
Cigarette smoking calms the nerves and gives you confidence.
If Your Royal Highness will be so kind as to open your hand...
It's sterilized.
Now..
Now... if I may take the liberty?
insert some into your mouth.
Excuse me, Doctor.
What is the purpose of this?
The classic approach, it cured Demosthenes.
That was in Ancient Greece... uh
Has it worked since?
Now, if you would be so kind as to read...
A wealth of words.
Fight against those marbles, Your Royal Highness.
Enunciate!
A little more concentration your Royal Highness.
I nearly swallowed the bloody things!
Thank you so much, Doctor, it's been most... hmm interesting.
Insert marbles!
He can insert his own bloody marbles...!
Tick, tock, tick, tock.
You know, you can't keep doing this, Bertie.
I know.
Promise me:
no more.
Hello.
Is anyone there?
I'm just in the loo.
Ah, Mrs. Johnson There you are.
I'm sorry, there's no receptionist.
I like to keep things simple.
"Poor and content is rich and rich enough."
- Sorry?
- Shakespeare.
How are you?
How do you do?
Coughing a lot.
Now, this is slightly awkward, but..
I'm afraid you're late.
Yes, I'm afraid I am.
Where's Mr. Johnson?
He doesn't know I'm here.
That's not a promising start.
My husband has seen everyone to no avail.
Awfully 'fraid he's given up hope.
He hasn't seen me.
You're awfully sure of yourself.
Well, I'm sure of anyone who wants to be cured.
Of course, he wishes to be cured.
My husband is umm...
he's required to speak publicly.
Perhaps he should change jobs?
He can't.
Indentured servitude?
Something of that nature.
Well we need to have your hubby pop by...
Uh...
Tuesday would be good...
He can give me his personal details and I'll make a frank appraisal and then, we can take it from there.
I do not have a hubby...
We don't 'pop' and nor do we ever talk about our private lives.
You...
must come to us.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Johnson, my game, my turf, my rules.
You'll have to talk over this with your husband and then you can speak to me on the telephone
Thank you very much for dropping by.
Good afternoon.
And what if my husband were the Duke of York?
The Duke of York?
Yes...
the Duke of York.
I thought the appointment was for Johnson?
Forgive me, your...?
Royal Highness.
Johnson was used during the Great War;
when the Navy didn't want the enemy to know "he" was aboard.
Am I... considered the enemy?
You will be, if you remain un-obliging.
You'll appreciate the need for absolute discretion.
Of course.
How did you find me, Your Royal Highness?
The President of the Speech Therapists Society.
Eileen McLeod?
She's a sport.
She warned me your antipodean methods were unorthodox and controversial.
I warned her...
those were not my favorite words.
I can cure your husband.
But for my method to work I need trust and total equality.
Here, in the safety of my consultation room.
No exceptions.
Well then, in that case...
When can you start?
Still sounds a bit rough, mate.
You make me drive too slowly, Dad!
Did you pick mum up from Bridge?
Yes, I've hardly been out of the car all day.
I had a special visitor this afternoon.
- May I please leave this table
- How special, special?
No, You must stay, bored stupid, listening to your parents' inane conversation.
- Thanks Dad...
- and Mum.
- Me too.
- You meeting Jean?
No, someone else.
Doctor?
Doctor?
Go help your brother with the washing up.
I'm fine.
Who is it, Lionel?
Why bring it up if you can't talk about it?
Myrtle, lt's just a woman, looking to help her husband.
Oh!
And I had a "call".
for an audition.
- One of my favorites.
- Aren't they all?
It could be a lot of fun.
I'm sure you'll be splendid.
They're a highly regarded group.
From Putney.
Tomorrow, Chapter IV.
"The Flight".
Oh, to fly away!
Weren't they lucky!
Now Papa tell a story!
Could I be a penguin instead?
Once, there were two princesses...
Princess Elizabeth and Princess Margaret.
whose Papa was a penguin.
This was because he had been turned into one by the wicked witch.
This was inconvenient for him because he loved... to hold his princesses in his arms... but you can't if you're a penguin because penguins have wings like herrings.
Herrings don't have wings.
Penguins have wings which are shaped like herrings
What made matters worse... is that she sent him to the South Pole, which is an awfully long walk... back,
if you can't fly.
So.. when he reached the water, he dived in... through the depths so fast... that he was in Southampton waters by lunchtime.
And from there, he took the 2.30 to Weybridge, changed at Clapham Junction and asked a passing mallard the way to Buckingham Palace.
He swam up the Thames, out through the plughole, and gave the cook,
Mama and...
Mrs. Whittaker quite a shock.
Now when the girls heard all the commotions, they ran to the kitchen where they gave him a good scrub, a mackerel and a kiss.
and as they kissed him, guess what he turned into?
A handsome prince.
A short-tailed albatross.
With wings so big that he could wrap them both around his two girls together.
Now, now...
It's time for bed.
Will Mrs. Simpson be there?
My brother's insisting.
Is he serious?
About her coming to dinner?
No.
About her!
A married woman?
He can't be.
She can.
By the way,
I think I found someone rather interesting.
On Harley Street.
A doctor.
Out of the question.
I'm not having this conversation again.
The matter's settled.
His approach seems rather different...
Now?
Now.
"Now is the winter of our discontent,"
"Made glorious summer by this sun of York."
"And all the clouds that lour'd upon our house
In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.
Now are our brows, bound with victorious... wreaths;
Thank you!
Lovely diction Mr...?
Logue.
Lionel Logue.
Well, Mr. Logue.
I'm not hearing the cries of a deformed creature yearning to be King.
Nor did I realize Richard the Third was King of the Colonies.
I do know the lines.
I've played the role before.
- Sydney?
- Perth.
Major theater town, is it?
Enthusiastic.
- Ah.
- I was well reviewed.
Yes...
well...
Lionel,
I think our dramatic society, is looking for someone slightly younger and a... little more regal.
Where did you find this... physician?
Classifieds, next to "French model, Shepherd's Market".
He comes highly recommended.
Charges substantial fees in order to help the poor.
Oh dear, perhaps he's a Bolshevik?
!
No receptionist.
He likes to keep things simple.
The Johnsons.
You can go in now, Mr. Johnson.
Lionel says... wait here if you wish, Mrs. Johnson.
Or, it being a p... pleasant day, p-perhaps take a stroll.
Was that alright...
Lionel?
Marvellous!
Willy.
You can stay and wait for your mom.
Mrs. Johnson...
Mr. Johnson, do come in.
He's a good lad, Willy.
He could hardly make a sound, you know, when he first came to me.
My boys made those.
Good, aren't they?
Please make yourself comfortable.
I was told not to sit too close.
Well I believe when speaking with a Prince,
One waits for the prince to choose a topic.
Waiting for me to...
commence a conversation...
one can wait a rather long wait.
Do you know any jokes?
Timing isn't my strong suit.
Cuppa tea?
No thank you.
Aren't you going to start treating me Dr. Logue?
Only if you're interested in being treated.
Please, call me Lionel.
I prefer Doctor.
I prefer Lionel.
What'll I call you?
Your Royal Highness, then Sir after that.
A bit formal for here.
I prefer names.
Prince Albert...
Frederick Arthur George.
How about Bertie?
Only my family uses that.
Perfect.
In here, it's better if we're equals.
If we were equal I wouldn't be here.
I'd be at home with my wife and no-one would give a damn.
Please, Don't do that.
I'm sorry?
I believe, Sucking smoke into your lungs will kill you.
My physicians say it relaxes the throat.
They're idiots.
They've all been knighted.
Makes it official then.
My 'castle', my rules.
What was your earliest memory?
What?
an earth do you mean?
Your First recollection.
I'm not... here to discuss my personal matters.
Why're you here then?
Because I bloody well stammer!
You have a bit of a temper?
One of my many faults.
When did the defect start?
I've always been this way!
I doubt that.
Don't tell me!
It's my stammer!
It's my field.
I can assure you, no infant starts to speak with a stammer.
When did yours start?
four or five.
That's typical.
So I've been told.
I can't remember not doing it.
I can believe that.
Do you hesitate when you think?
Don't be ridiculous.
How about when you talk to yourself?
Everyone natters occasionally Bertie.
Stop calling me that!
I'm not going to call you anything else.
Then we shan't speak!
Are you charging for this, Doctor?
A fortune.
So, when you talk to yourself, do you stammer?
Of course not!
Well, that proves your impediment isn't a permanent part of you.
What do you think was the cause?
