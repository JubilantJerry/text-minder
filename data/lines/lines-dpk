[ Wind Howling ]
Hey!
[ Wind Whistling ]
Hey!
[ Groans ]
[ Air Hissing ]
This is Commander Christopher Draper... the Navy of the United States of America, planet Earth... former copilot Mars Gravity Rrobe 1.
On our third orbit of this planet... we took evasive action to avoid collision with a meteor... and were forced into dangerous gravitational pull of Mars.
We were forced to abandon ship.
As of now, the vehicle frame is still orbiting Mars.
Seems to have established gravitational balance.
[ Air Hissing ]
[ Hissing Stops ]
We ejected capsule without incident...
Colonel Dan McReady ejecting after I did.
I'll set out to look for him tomorrow.
From all indications, he should be on the other side of a high range of rocky peaks to the west.
Now, my two most difficult problems are air and water.
I have, with what's left in my tank and one reserve cylinder, enough oxygen for... oh, about 60 hours... depending, of course, on how much I exert myself.
My first discovery was that the air on Mars is far too thin to support human life.
As to water, by severe rationing, I can get by for about 15 days.
Course, once my air gives out, water won't matter.
First positive survival point:
I found a yellow rock.
It's as burnable as some of our poorer grades of coal.
Heat's uneven, but it should make the Martian nights endurable.
[ Air Hissing ]
I feel a little bit like Columbus... set down in a strange new land... full of new wonders... new discoveries.
It's a challenge, all right -- a challenge to my training.
Sometimes challenges can get mighty big.
But I'm gonna stay alive, believe me.
That's for the morale officer.

[ Murmuring ]
[ Panting ]
[ Breathing Erratically ]
[ Gasping ]
[ Groans ]
[ Gasping ]
[ Grunts ]
[ Air Hissing ]
Well, I've licked the heat and shelter problem.
Breathing -- that's a different story.
Moving about, exerting myself, I've found that I can... breathe the air of Mars for about, oh, 12 to 15 minutes... before I need to take air from my tank for a booster.
Lying down, asleep... inactive, I can get by for an hour before taking a booster.
In this way, with some discomfort, I can conserve my oxygen supply.
At the most optimistic appraisal...
I have 50 or so hours of life left...
God willing.
The problem is sleeping.
If I don't wake up in time to renew my air supply, it's hearts and flowers.
I've got to make some kind of alarm device, safeguard myself.
[ Clangs ]
Tomorrow -- and morning's only a couple of hours away--
I'm gonna rejoin Mac.
Good old Mac.
I'll bet he's got these problems licked.

I've found an answer that's saved my life temporarily.
These yellow stones that burn like coal.
I've been wondering about this a lot.
Where do they get the oxygen to burn?
It must be similar to solid rocket fuel with its own built-in oxygen.
Heat and flame release it.
And it's breathable.
I've gotta find some way to store it.
As far as life on this planet...
I've seen no sign of any other living thing anywhere... yet.

Well, I've now been on Mars for two weeks.
I've tried on several occasions to talk down the wreck of our space vehicle, the Elinor M.
I can't break it out of Mars's gravity grip.
It answers electronically, but the jets don't fire.
No fuel left.

Good old Woodward.
You used to be about as interesting as a common brick.
Now, Professor, I'm glad to have you aboard.
This second phase of survival, finding water... will deal with locating water on another planet.
Since no one has landed on another planet yet --
- Oh, is that so?
- we will have to proceed... with hypothetical knowledge from our studies here on Earth.
- I can give you a tip from here on Mars.
- Water is where you find it.
Like gold.
The thing is to know where to find it.
And you must make sure it's potable.
- Don't drink seawater.
- No seas here.
Seawater's too salty.
So's urine.
- [ Squawks ]
- Rain and snow... become groundwater and sink in under the ground.
- No rain.
No snow.
- On some dry, desert planets... it may be possible to crush rocks... and extract latent water from them.

A guy can lick the problems of heat, water, shelter, food.
I know.
I've done it.
And here's the hairiest problem of all -- isolation, being alone.
Boy, here's where he'll crack.
Here's where he'll go under.
I know, I know.
I had great training, including two months in the isolation chamber.
But when I was in that chamber, I knew I was coming out.
I knew I'd be with people again.
But up here on Mars... you've gotta face the reality of being alone forever.

Last night occurred the most important event since I landed on Mars 147 days ago.
An interplanetary space vehicle made a landing... like no space vehicle I've ever seen on Earth.
From what I see from my videotape... it was manned by some animated beings, obviously from some planet other than Mars.
They're here, apparently, on an ore-gathering expedition.
They mine electronically by remote control.
They also use slaves, and they handle them electronically.
One of them escaped.
He's with me.
And I'm trying to establish communication with him.
He's pretty much like an Earth being... except he's completely mute.

Oh, of.. sure, we're all ears, or at least Cecil here is.
- Hey, come on, Ruf..
It all begin like every other day before Crusoe came to my island.
Just another day in paradise, every day was the same.
Beautiful turquoise water, blue skies and lots of delicious fruit.
Sounds perfect right?
Boring if you ask me.
How much paradise can a bird take.
I really wanted to get off this island.
Let's see what's been washed up today?
Of course, more of these.
What's this?
This can be promising.
Heyguys,it is loolout time
Hey, ah.. be right there.
Hi Rosie, check out these delicious traits.
Gorgeous, just gorgeous.
Just look at all those bugs.
The beetles are the best.
Crunchy on the outside, with a soft gooey center.
Hey, where did it go?
- My kind of vermin.
- You thief.
Carmello, that wasn't very nice.
Aren't you joining us for a lool out today Mac?
, we're all here.
Yeah, I'll be right there, do we really need to lool out every day?
So, what did you bring today?
I'm not sure what it is.
I meant food for the lool out.
Of course he didn't bring anything for the lool out.
This is beautiful.
Hey, guy, guys, I think I really found something important this time
Check this out!
Where?
What?
- Scrubby, you're really going blind.
- Over here!
Oooh!
, smells delicious.
No, no, is not food.
It's proof that there's more to the world than just our island.
Oh, here we go again.
It's true.
Can't we just eat in peace for once.
Sure, no problem, just as long as you can tell me where this came from.
Fromthewater.
I vote for Carmello.
I too vote for Carmello.
Itoovotefor Carmello.
Oh, come on, this isn't election.
- The thing in the bobble is.. is..
- Is what?
You know what I think, Mac?
That thingy is whatever you want to believe it is.
Exactly
You are one hopeless dreamer.
Did you forget you almost died of exhaustion..
flying across the ocean..
looking for this other world of yours.
My dear macaw, you must wake up and smell the papaya.
For this is the world.
I don't care what you guys say, there's a bigger world out there and I intend to find it.
#I plymy trade from the Union Jack!
#uponthesevenseas #andunlessIeatsome rancid meat #buryme soulwhere the mermaid please
I wanna be mat makers of that green around the gills.
We ain't anchoring to be sharing your lunch with you, lad.
Sorry, I'm not much of a sailor.
You're there right.
If you're fixing the up jock find your way down we..
My hat.
Your poor stomach, you see..
wait 'till you get to them strange islands..
and you meet your first cannibals.
Cannibals?
We made our choice to go to sea, right, easy ol' pal?
And I swear, I'll not regret it.
Alright, go and bring me something to eat.
Right May, I wont fail you.
Good day, you lucky clucks will you join me for a little snack?
Come on now.
No need to be shy.
I'll chop you..
What business might you be having above decks?
I was just making sure my chicken food.
He, he, he.. friends..
were fresh.
No, warm..
warm and confy..
Get your fur over there..
not!
So, then, where were we?
Knockitoff
You cats belong down below, and stay away from our chickens.
That goes for you as well!
Who does that green gill land lover thinks he is?
The huminus, threw us into the haul?
This is our ship wretched as it is, it's home.
Mark my word now, someday, somehow, that canine and his human will pay.
I'm with you there mate, they'll pay alright.
How much exactly we're charging them?
That should teach them to mess with our egg supply.. hey ol' boy!
Oh, no, not again.
Buck up, boy' yo?
Ah, looks like we got one tuesday of a storm brewing.
So much for a peaceful meal.
Oh, nobody saw that one coming, hang on Carmello!
Perhaps it would be wise to move this far east to the cave.
Let's get moving, this is gonna be a nasty one.
I'm with you on that call.
Hey, Mac, grab the pineapple.
Like we really needed this pineapple.
Oh, hands on deck, and get those sails down.
Hey you self homemade, mister ride up the storm there.
Aynsley!
I got you.
Hey, hey!
Help!
Help!
Look out, flying away pineapple!
Sorry Pango.
- Careful Rosie.
- I got it!
Scrubby!
Heeeeelp!
Quick Rosie, the tree!
Easy Scrubby, don't panic.
Ok, I got you now.
Well, come on you old goat, get your hooves moving.
We ain't got all day.
That's it!
Eeeaasy..
don't be afraid.
One step at a time.
- Ooohh!
- Scrubby!
- Help!
He's not going to make it, do something!
Carmello, grab him.
I got hiiiiim...!
He..
He..
Heeeelp!
Help!
, we're in here!
Someone help!
Help!
Away!
Payback time!
I can't hold on 'mello, this is the end little buddy?
There's not much time, they're gonna fall.
Keep steady, I'm coming mates.
Pango, what are you doing?
Oohh!
How's it going mate?
Nice try Pango, but is hopeless, I'm a goner.
Mac!
Hold on!
Hold on!
Come on, come on, come on!
I'll get you guys out of there!
Ooohh!
, we have to do something!
Mac!
This just went from bad to worse.
Hey, don't worry guys, that branch looks pretty solid to me
Right, but how do we get down?
You got me there.
Oh, I can't believe it.
- They're alive!
- It's a miracle.
Hey, anybody wants some pineapple?
Do you hear that sound?
What's out there, Mac?
I have no idea.
Never heard a sound like that before.
Can you see anything?
Not a thing, unfortunately, we're gonna have to wait until morning.
Same old stuff.
Shells and more shells.
Swollen..
begones.
That's a new taste.. earthy, with a slight touch of salt.
Come on, come tu papa!
Hey, Scrubs..
what'd you find?
What is it you're eating?
I don't know, but it's delicious.
Oh, Scrubs..
you don't collect stuff like this.
My nose tells me there's more goodies at that rocky point.
- Oh, look at that?
- Wooden Ca..terpillars.
See, I was right.
This is the most incredible proof that there's another world out there.
No, look behind you?
What are you talking about, behind me?
I can't believe it.
Is the thing we heard dying last night.
What do you think it is?
The other world.
- I have to get a closer look.
- Mac don't, we have no idea what it is.
If it's dangerous, Mac?
This is amazing, I was right!
I knew it, I knew it, I knew it!
This is from the other world!
I've never seen anything like this.
Incredible!
Mac should be more careful.
Pango is right!
, we should keep our distance.
whaaa...wha.. wha..
what's going on?
Easy now, whatever you are.
I just want to talk.
See monsters?
Wow!
, look at this.
This heart makes me shoot leftings.
Hello, is anyone out there?
Hey, can anybody hear me?
Oh, look at it!
Captain?
, Bosen?
, anyone?
It's hideous!
Where did they all go.
I can't believe everyone is really gone.
Looks like there's just the two of us.
Let's go to shore.
Hang on Aynsley.
The current is really strong.
Land, sweet land!
Is so good to be alive Aynsley.
Pot your uncle, sea monsters walking on land?
Oh, oh!
We're in big trouble.
Only one thing has two legs.
A bird!
That ain't no bird I've ever seen.
Yeah, he can't even fly.
That monster is going to eat Carmello.
What's going on Aynsley?
We gotta do something, now!
Hurry, make as much noise as you can.
We have to scare those sea monsters off.
Come back here Aynsley.
Stay close together, we don't know what's out there.
What was that?
Aynsley?
, Aynsley what's that noise?
Cannibals!
Aynsley cannibals!
We have to get off this island.
Sailor warned us.
They'll skin us alive and eat us.
Hurry ol' boy, they're coming for us!
Get inside Aynsley, go boy, go, there.
Guys, guys, guys, what are you doing?
Scaring off the sea monsters, thank you very much.
And what if they aren't sea mosnters.
Did you see the furry one's teeth?
He'll reap us to shreds.
- Everybody calm down, we're safe here.
- Are we?
We really don't know what those creatures are capable of.
I know one thing they are capable of..
leaving the island.
What?
Oh, no, come on, this can't be happening to me.
He's actualy leaving.
We did it, we got rid of him.
Yeah, we scared them big time.
Will somebody tell me what's happening?
I'll tell you what's going on..
you guys have ruined my chance to get off this island and see the world.
You really don't get it, do you?
You think this is paradise, well, it is not.
It meant so much to me.
- He's back.
- Oh no, here we go again.
Back?
, are you serious?
, let me see.
Here's what we're gonna do, we stay out of sight.
And.. we keep an eye on them.
To see what they end up doing, ok?
Ok, then, nobody goes on the beach, that goes for you too Scrubby.
He, yeah, I heard you.
Didn't even get to finish my breakfast.
All of those new smells are driving me crazy.
I gotta go check it out.
Where are you going Scrubby?
Sssh, come back!
It's not safe out there.
Hmm.. can't let all those tasty mussels get washed away.
If I recall correctly didn't Mac say we should all stay out of sight.
He did.
Speaking of which, where is Mac?
Sorry about today ol' friend, that was a pretty inactive attempt.
What was I thinking?
, I haven't the foggiest idea where we are.
All for that matter, the slightest inkling in which direction to set sail.
Someone is bound to come and save us 'ol boy.
I'm sure of it.
If those cannibals come back, we'll be ready for them.
Who's out there?
Show yourselves!
I don't want to tear you to shreds.
And I have a musket.
[Beeeeee]
A goat?
oh, It´s just a goat..
A bird?
, maybe there aren't hunters and cannibals after all.
Mac, what were you doing out there all by yourself?
I thought you said we should stay hidden.
I was just..checking things out, that's all.
What's all the commotion about anyway.
Well, Epi just made a good point.
I just suggested, hypothetically, that possibly the sea monster..
lost that thing that Mac jiffy found.
- And maybe he's come to get it back.
- Along with us.
Is one of two things for sure..
a coincidence, or a baaad omen.
In a way you need to get rid of it.
Why not just give it back to the sea monsters.
- A "G" idea.
- No way!
- Wha..wha..wha..
- You're kidding!
- You're so selfish.
- Selfish?
Ok, maybe.
Just give me time to think about it.
But if I do give it back, you're all coming with me.
Well..
We're right there Aynsley.
We got some work to do.
Let's save all we can before is all lost to the sea.
How is he looking mate?
They're taking over our beach.
He's pulling strange stuff out from the sea.
I suppose this means they're not leaving anytime soon, then.
Looks that way.
Do you see how the furry one sleeps all day while the big one does the work.
No, but I'll take your word for it.
I bet the sleeping one is the boss.
Look, he stripped off his skin.
Ugh..
I'm going to be sick.
Noneofus knewitatthetime, but we were being watched by the real monsters on the island
Some luck May..
their green gill human and his manking mock mating safety here.
How are we gonna deal with him, he might be a problem for us.
Don't you worry, I'll figure out a way to get rid of them quick enough
For the time being we sit, watch and wait.
Oohh, come on May, I'm starving here.
And cut to what I just say!
Sit, watch and wait.
That's right, now stay focused.
We got the upper claw.
No one knows we're here, which means we take our time..
and we pick them off one by one.
Ha, look Aynsley, this can come in very handy
I gotta to practice before we venture out there to get our dinner, right boy!
#I plymy trade from the Union Jack!
#uponthesevenseas #unlessIeat some rancid meat #buryme soulwhere the mermaid please
Steady!
-What'she doing?
- Shh.
Back your hammer, and..
I don't know about you Scrubby, but I'm planning on stayting as far away from that monster as possible.
- What was that all about?
- I have absolutely no idea.
What we need to find out, is what these newcomers intentions are,
Fromthesoundofit, they're up to no good
- Obviously they're trying to kill us.
- Maybe, but maybe not.
The truth of the matter is that these newcomers have brought nothing but trouble to our paradise, that is a fact.
Fine, then do like I ask, and stay out of sight.
they're proof that there's another world out there and I'm going to find out whether they're friend or foe.
You really don't get it, do you!
That was close!
Ok, let's give this a go, one last time.
Oh!
Did you see that Aynsley!
I did it, I hit the mark!
Let's go fix something to eat, ol' boy.
That was a miracle, I'd never thought I'd hit it.
Well..
I canhit something after all..
I was starting to wonder if everyone wasn't right, the new world was finally here and I had no idea if I was ready for it or not.
Tapir'sreadyas i've ever seen.
Goforthethroat, let's make this quick
Wait,thehuman!
Oh, I can't do it boy, go on, shuu, go!
What now?
Sorry pal,
I've never shot anything before, why don't we try fishing.
What's burning?
Thatwouldbe me .
You smell like bump biscuits.
Shh,something'scoming.
Looks like Rosie was here, that's strange,
Rosie never leaves any food behind.
Would you prefer light or dark meat for lunch, darling?
I prefer...
Dog!
Ready to get even, ratter!
Hold Aynsley, I'm coming, those blasted ratters, they did survive after all.
I'm hit!
Run for it!
Good dog!
You're alright ol' boy?
Did you I hear that?
Over there!
It's a bird, a beautiful parrot.
Strangely, that's what all the fuss was about
The ratters went after the bird.
You did good ol' boy, and you, we're gonna fix you up straight away.
Look Aynsley!
a ring!
that can only mean one thing
Sailors have sail for this island before
I believe there's hope for us after all.
You can come out guys, there's no one around.
It's too dark, I can't see a thing.
This is the very spot where that sea monster attack me.
Well, sort of..
Oh!
I've almost..
We shouldn't have let him go alone.
Maybe he's molting.
That's a bit of a stretch Pango.
Just wait 'till I get my hooves on them!
Anyway you look at it, this is not good.
Mac can't be gone.
What's that?
And who are you two?
Just two homeless castaways, we were held captive by that human for months with nothing to eat but the crumbs from his table.
What about our friend?
Did you see him by any chance?
Oh, It's a true tragedy, alright.
Oh, an unfortunate turn of events.
You see we caught..!
We saw the hosting.
Well, come on, let's hear it.
What are you waiting for?
We'll tell you what happened to your friend.
For I'm warning you, it ain't pretty.
You see, the human loves to eat birds, and I'm afraid your friend got..
trapped.
This should only take a minute, It's just dislocated.
But.. it's going to hurt, a bit.
Don't worry.
You´ll feel better in a day or two, though you won't be able to fly right away.
Well then, I suppose you'll need name if you're gonna stay here for a while.
Let's see, by my reckoning today is.. tuesday, that's a good a name as any, mate.
Can you say..
Tuesday.
T u e s d a y
Well, not quite, but that's a start.
Take care of our new friend, boy.
I'd better offload as much stuff as I can.
There's no telling how much the ship will stay in one piece.
- They're nothing but cannibals!
- Murderers.
I say we run him off our island drive them monsters back into the sea!
Perhaps a plan might be to force them to live on curse island.
Oh, yes, yes, yes.
Curse Island.
What exactly is Curse Island?
Hu, hu, hu, the end of the earth, mate, no one's ever made it back from there.
Yeah, there's nothing there but bugs.
Lots and lots of nasty bugs!
Sounds purrrfect, drive them to curse island.
That's not gonna work.
You have a better idea?
No.
Right, so then, where were we?
Stop your flapping about bird.
You need to be resting that wing of yours.
What do you want from me?
I just want to talk.
Me name is Aynsley, and for what I understand yours is Tuesday.
Call me whatever you want, except dinner.
Dinner?
, we're not going to eat you, we saved your life.
Either way, you don't make much of a meal.
Not like a fat, juicy turkey sweetheart back at home.
- What?
- Relax.
My master likes you.
- You said, your master?
- You did not think that I...
I like you, you're funny.
I've never seen a bird like you in England.
England
Tell me more Aynsley.
Well buddy, England, my island.
Just one fantastic place in a sea of many lands.
I knew it!
Crusoe wants to explore them all.
If we ever get off this one.
You know, you're the first to come from the outside world.
Oh dear, ha,ha,ha, that's not good news.
Hey, hold on a second, we're all dress up like this.. because...?
Because you look fierce, now get your heads in the game everyone.
We have the perfect opportunity, the dog and that bird are still on the ship.
Right.
Listen up!
here's the plan, we'll deal with the hairy beast on the ship.
The rest of you.
Go for the human on the beach.
What is sheep?
That wooden thing on the beach.
As soon we're on the ship, "the wooden thing".
- You attack!
- Alright then, fierce, fierce, fierce!
So, I'm a fierce coconut?
But I should go tell my friends that I'm ok.
You better stay put, you're in no condition to fly.
Well, look at this..
we can kill two birds with one stone.
There's two birds now?
Oh, shut it, just follow my lead.
Look, look!
that's him.
- He's wearing Mac like a trophy.
- That is so wrong!
Attack!
Let's get'em.
Aynsley, we gotta go.
What's going on out there.
They've all got mad.
Itappearsas yourfriendshave come to avenge your death.
I'm not dead!
Oh, we're gonna take care of that.. right now.
Aynsley!
Help!
Aynsley!
Help!
Come on down there and fight!
Aynsley!
Twist it!
- Hold on, that sounded like..
- Mac!
Aynsley!
- Mac, get out!
- Kiki!
Mac!
I'm coming boy!
Rotten cats!
You are to blame for all this!
Gotta leave the ship, mate!
- Aynsley!
- Go!
What's happening here?
I thought Mac was dead.
We all did, but I don't think he made it this time.
That would be horrible..
Come on guys, we better move back now.
Oh no, Aynsley, what have I done.
Land...
Land!
We're safe, mate, I thought we were goners.
Oh, will you just shut up!
- What's that noise?
- That would be bugs.
- Bugs!
- Curse Island!
Rest in peace ol' boy.
Tuesday.
- Pss, Mac!
- Kiki!
Mac, you're hurt!
I'll be ok.
I'm sure glad to see you.
- I was worried.
- Me too.
Come on, now is your chance to get away
- I can't.
- Well, let me help you.
No, no, no, I just, I don't, want to get away.
- What?
- You don't understand, is all those cats fault.
- What do you mean...
- They attacked me, he fixed my wing.
And his dog gave his life to save me.
I can't leave him now
Oh, I see.
So, he's going to take care of you?
Look, he's gonna need my help to survive.
I owe him that.
Exactly, how do you plan on doing that?
I mean, look at him.
Ah!
, Tuesday!
Help!
I don't believe it, those cats used us and Mac as well, and what do we do?
We attacked the human.
Hold on, then.
So, what you're saying is Kiki's debrained fault on this.
Oh, fatal.
That'snotfair,weall thought Mac was dead.
-Didn'twe ?
- Oh, this is not good, mate.
Yeah, we've made a real mess of things.
Looks that way Epi gal.
- Where are you going Rosie?
- I'm going to clean up our mess.
- I'm in!
- Let's get cracking then, mate.
Wait a second.
You're going to make an even bigger mess of things.
Wild beasts, they're going to get us!
Stay right where you are.
I've got a special treat for all of you.
I just wanted to give you some biscuits, that's all.
They're quite good.
I finished off your dog human and I promise one day you and the rest of your lot will join him.
Now that, is the taste of desperation.
Try to get one, they taste just like chicken.
What, do you want to show me something?
Alright, let's go!
Tuesday.
This is fantastic.
Fresh water.
Good job..
Tuesday.
What?
You want me to follow you?
Okay, I'm coming!
Hey guys, look who's here.
Relax.. there's nothing to be afraid of.
Stay right where you are, I'll be right back.
What got into him, why is he running away?
- Beats me.
- Maybe it's your smell.
Try one of these, it's really good.
And some for you, and try.
So choosy, where's pretty bird.
i haven't see her yet.
Prettybird.
You don't need to yell Mac, I mean Tuesday.
- I'm right here.
- Here you have pretty bird.
Here, do you see, I don't hurt you.
Come on, don't be afraid.
Comeonprettybird.
Well, friendships aren't made in a day.
Taking one step at a time, right choosy.
Onestep.
I can't May, the current is too strong.
So, you failed again, did you?
Would you stop feeling sorry for yourself?
Oh, time will come.
Soon there will be more of us.
Revenge will be sweet.
That hurt.
Ah, you can't see a bloody thing, can you old goat?
We're gonna have to fix that.
There you are.
That should help.
Why Rosie, you're no pig.
Hey, what has gotten into you?
You're gorgeous?
Easy big boy.
No, no.
Oh no.
Tuesday help.
Hey guys!
Nevermind.
This is hopeless.
How am I ever going to survive in this island?
Yes, of course, that's it!
I have to build a tree house!
It's raining tree limbs.
Is good enough to eat.
Is there anything you wouldn't eat?
Hey snail, what's he doing?
Come on mate, he's just bunkers on us.
He's destroying the tree.
I can't saw more...
Need to finish shelter..
we must build..
Yes Sir. a whole porridge.. please.
We had no clue what Crusoe was up to.
Sawing..
porridge..
Yep, as Pango would say, he was bonkers to the max.
Are you coming along May.
Can I have just a little peak?
Can you just wait, I'm cleaning them up.
Well could you at least tell me how big a litter we have?
More than we'll ever be able to feed, I'm afraid.
You look kittie..
That's smart.
I'm trying to work here, go eat somewhere else.
At this rate, I'll never get this built.
I told you, go!
Ah, nevermind.
What I wouldn't give for an extra set of hands.
For all his pounding and sawing we couldn't figure what he was actually doing.
What is going on?
- Really?
- I couldn't blame Rosie.
When you got an itch, you gotta scatch it.
The poor Crusoe he didn't see it that way.
He has had enough.
and that's when it hit me..
a nest..
Hey, guys.
I've figured out what he was doing..
Making an ass?
His building a shelter.
- We don't follow you mate.
- He's building a nest.
- A nest?
- So he is a bird.
Scrubs.
He's building a human nest in the tree.
Pretty clever.
I've never slept in a tree.
If he stocks it with food, you'll sleep in a tree.
Good point, so guys, I got an idea, what do you say we help'm out.
Get this nest of his built.
I must've been crazy, thinking I can build all this by my..
self..
We didn't really have any idea what we were getting into.
We just figure let's help, use whatever abilities we had and hoped it all worked.
I 'll be gobsmacked.
Slowly, slowly.
Slowly, slowly.
That's it, just a little more.
Hi Epi, where are you headed with all that food?
I need a little help here guys.
Not that kind of help.
It tickles.
Epi hold up, I'm starving.
Help.
Things didn't always go smoothly and we had our ups and downs.
That's for sure.
But everyone was in fine spirits and Crusoe seemed..
well.. happy.
He made a funny little door for Epi and Pango to get into the nest.
It was a pretty good idea.
After a few modifications that is.
We became a real team, playing all these funny games Crusoe came up with.
He had all sorts of crazy ideas oh, and hide and seek in the ground.
Crusoe had a funny way of eating, he peeled the fruit.
And boy did he eat slow.
It took quite a while but despite his ackwardness and all of his flaws
Crusoe surprised even the most skeptical among us.
That's it, that's it, watch your step.
I've just put the finishing touches on our new home.
New home, hold it right there, first thing we must do is christen the place.
It's good luck you know.
I christen thee.
Oh, nevermind.
The preach is for us.
Wow, now look at that.
It's so beautiful.
Hip, hip, hooray!
What in the world is that noise he's making?
Sounds like Scrubby when he needs food.
It's painful mate, let's get out of here.
Personally, I think it sounds beautiful.
A party and we weren't invited.
Now, could you come here.
- I'm starving here.
- Coming.
You know how difficult it is in my condition to hunt right now.
Have you tried to make it to the other island lately.
Oh May, you know the last time I'd tried I almost drowned.
I'm afraid we're just stuck with just the bugs and spiders.
They sound delicious.
Now go and hunt some up for me!
Right.. darling.
I'll wrap'em in seeweed just the way you like'em.
With the nest completed, Crusoe moved on to a new project.
We didn't have to forage for food, we had this great nest and we even had indoor plumbing.
Paradise.. just got better.
That human sure has made life peachy for us.
Rosie is sponsor to the max,
I tell ye ol' girl, if this new world talks about this cuchie it might not be that bad after all.
Getting a little plump aren't we, sitting around all day?
Ain't nothing wrong with a few curves, Kiki honey.
With Crusoe doing the fishing, it would put the superb in you too in no time, Kiki.
Oh, what do we have here?
Looks like Crusoe is going to put your fish and scales to shame, Kiki.
As time passed, life became more and more confortable for us all.
Yet, Crusoe seemed very sad at times, he missed his old world.
He build a strange tower on the highest point of the island.
with bright lights burning every night.
Another day and no ship in sight little fellow.
what I wouldn't give to see the sun set over the Thames.
Thames?
I'm going partner.
I don't get it, why does he light this thing every night?
In the hope that some other humans pass by.
If they see the signal, they'll come and rescue him.
I knew the chances of leaving this island, would become slimmer as time went by
I just didn't know how slim.
More humans on the island, that's not gonna happen.
And now my friends, like all good Englishman, a moment of silence.
To give thanks for this bountiful harvest.
Mind your manners.
Our host is.
- Taking a snooze at the peers.
- Ye he, he, or worse.
Hey, stop fooling around.
At least we're not out in that weather.
It's miserable out there.
listen you guys, we're meant to live in the weather, have you'all gone soft.
Wow, wow, Kiki, why get so worked up?
Oh, you haven's seen worked up, answer me this,
What happens to us when Crusoe leaves this island?
- have you thought of that.
- Kiki, now, now, listen!
I'm listening!
, I'm listening loud and clear, Mac!
Shall we eat!
If I could just find me some mussels!
One miscel little mussel.
Oh, It's mine, It's all mine, mine, mine, mine.
- What´s yours!
- Nothing.
You wouldn't be depriving your family!
Now, would you sweetheart?
- Yes..
..I mean no.
Come here!
- Oh May, that hurts.
- Shame on you.
Look, the ship is falling apart.
Our luck is turning, we'll be able to make it back to the mainland after all.
Hey, let's say we go outside and have some fun on the water slide.
Great idea, I love all the smells after a good rain.
I'll catch with you guys later, I better find Kiki first, make sure she's alright.
Why didn't that ship just vanish into the sea.
Our lives are never going to be the same again.
Show me that snack before we move on to the main island.
- No!
- Scream all you want little bird.
No one is coming to save you now.
- I'll be the son of a seacook!
- Watch out children, is the human!
Get your filthy paws off my bird.
- To the left!
- We have to get out of here quick!
Come on everyone!
we've got them surrounded!
- Attack!
- kaboom!
Oh no!
He got me!
If this is heaven?
Why are you here?
Shut!
They're heading for the big island.
They're everywhere!
It's all my fault.
We have to warn the others!
Get to the nest, now!
Hurry!
- Predators!
- What?
- Did he say predators?
Hang on if you want, I'll get my musket.
Fang down the hatches!
- Down the hatches!
- Weapons!
Gun powder!
I need some shirt.
That's it juicy!
They're everwhere!
Get off of me!
You bloody blasterds!
Help!
get me down from here!
I may not know humans, but they tend to be very angry.
Crusoe needs our help.
Look out!
Hurry Epi!
Pango, over here!
-Jump!
- Stand back Epi!
Hurry!
He's right behind you!
Go!
, go!
I need my musket!
look what you've done, You guys stay put!
Oh not again!
Stay away you mange cats!
Hang on Crusoe!
Good job buddy.
Wasn't so bad!
Keep puching!
I'll take care of these.
Pango!
Wow, is awful high!
Come on, you can make it.
Jump!
Oh my, here it goes!
Good work!
Now, let's get out of here!
Ok!
So long, furrball!
Hungry hour, well then take that!
Hakawa, Matata, banana!
So long!
Scrubby, the door!
Come on!
Hello there!
Very glad Scrubs!
Over here, Epi!
Hide in the bucket!
Going up!
Get off!
Get off, you mengie cat!
Good Work, Epi!
They'll never get me!
We got rid of them, didn't we?
Epi!
Pango!
- Help me!
- Look up behind you, Epi!
Let go of me!
The cats are trying to get in through the hatch!
Rosie no, that was Crusoe!
Let me get this open.
I hope you didn't hurt him.
- Everybody ok?
- Everybody except Crusoe.
Come on guys, all together, is heavy.
- Spread out Rosie, we need all the muscle we can mass bulk.
- Really?
Ok, ok.
One, two, three!
That's a bit of a bummer mate.
We need Crusoe, how's he doing Kiki?
He's alive, but he wont be of any use to us.
We're gonna need a miracle to hold on these cats back!
Got it, the musket.
Watch out guys, it's gonna be noisy.
Are you sure that's a good idea?
Is worth the try, what else can we do?
This is going to be easier than I thought.
The human's house, time to make our move.
Hurry, we can't hold 'em off much longer.
He always pulls that thing to the back first.
Ok, get ready.
Huh, that's weird.
What's happening in there?
Hey Tuesday, maybe this thing has something to do with it.
What thing?
Now what?
You know they're gonna come back.
Maybe Crusoe may come to and save us.
I hate to break it to you guys, we're on our own.
We have to get out of here.
Hide in some place.
What about Crusoe?
Pango's right, we can't leave him here.
Guys, guys, it may not be perfect.
But I think I got a plan.
Well you better lay it out cause we're out of time.
Alright children, calm down.
They just got lucky this time, we're gonna sneak up on them and make them pay.
Now let's show them what we're made of.
Oh, yeah.
You got a broken wing, have you?
Don't worry, we'll put you out of your misery.
Stay back, or I'll shoot!
Not so brave now, are you?
Appears your luck has just run out.
You'll have to be quicker than that, ratter.
Get him, he can't fly!
That should take care of you quite nicely.
Sweet dreams from your favorite ratter.
Get ready!
We got'em cornered May.
Then let's finish him off once and for all.
Catch me if you can, ratter!
Rosie stop, we have to wait for the signal.
This is it, give it all you have Rosie.
- Which way?
They tricked us.
- Hold on to your fangs.
We're not so cocky anymore.
Are we?
Tuesday is in trouble.
That was a bossus plan you had there mate!
Couldn't have done it without you guys!
The fire!
Crusoe!
Crusoe!
Over here!
Ouch!
, that must've really hurt.
We boat Crusoe out to safety unconscious, but alive.
And then out of the blue, we get cannon blasted from your ship.
Ahoy!
, the captain can be one tough bloke.
Expect!
They're pirates after all.
Pirates?
He, he, you know, like them nasty ratchets only worse.
A pack of crazed cats in my right I was sure I was a goner.
And I took my musket in one hand my sword in the other, carved a swat to the savage hordes.
It was horrible captain.
That is the most fantastical yarn I've heard in all me life.
This is no yarn, captain?
So ye say, well then, just trying to set sail, you and your bird can take a bunk below.
Oh, Captain, I cannot tell you how I love to see England again.
England!
We'll not be sailing from them ports unless you want me to be hanging from the gallows.
Right dreamer.
But you see, me..
I.. must..
Can you at least drop me from a bit closer to home.
You're with us now.
Once a pirate, always a pirate.
Have you got a problem with that?
But Captain, if I might...
Enough talk!
Off with ya!
Then I'll be expecting you in the carrier you lad, or you will be walking the plank you will or worse.
Look!
is it a mirage May?
It's not another mirage you idiot.
It's a ship, children start paddling.
#I plymy trade from the Union Jack!
#uponthesevenseas #unlessIeat some rancid...
Hey, give me here, is my rum you're be drinking!
Oh!
you want some rum!
do ya?
How's me fisting ye instead.
These are some nasty pirates, but it wont end well if I stay another moment.
Hey, what you be fixing to do that?
Oh, nothing, nothing at all.
Is that right?
The ingrate we dawn rescue from the island is trying to steal one of our rowboats.
If prettyboy is going to be stealing anything, I'd be us!
No, I was just..
Hey, what's going on out here?
Bosun, he's trying to jump ship!
Get him in throne little prick.
Alright, let's teach him a lesson, take that.
He's getting away!
grab him!
Give me a piece of him!
There's no way out of this ship you fool!
Get him!
He's mine!
I'm ready!
A raft!
Ye fools, shooting the wrong side of the man, come on men..
show me what are ye be made of.
Bosun!
Get your scurby excuse for a pirate down to my cabin, now!
Aye, aye, Captain, right away!
And the rest of ye fools!
Back to work, before I give each ten lashes of me whip.
Disgusting bird!
He's getting away!
Shall we send some men after him?
Neh, let him go.
Oh, Captain, can't we fire a cannon short blow'em his misery!
Why waste a good cannonball, let'm spend the rest of his life on that long forgotten island.
That is if a wild beast doesn´t get him first.
Aye, aye, Captain!
It's been noice nawing ya Ruf..
we did ourselves a good run man, didn't we Cec..
Jump!
I wasn't going to let those ratters get ya, we friends gotta stick together.
Nice for you to think so.
Where are we heading off to then?
We're going home!
A tisket, a tasket, a biscuit for me breakfast...
Come on, Cec, stop your blabbing.
We're...
Almost there!
Look, Rufus, shadow puppets.
I haven't had me breakfast yet, either.
Ratter!
Whoa!
Shadow puppets?
Seriously, mate, you are one kidney short of a meat pie!
Uh, I was just...
Ah!
What the...
Oh!
Get off of me, ya good-for-nothing fleabag of a cat!
A sailor can't even get a night's sleep without some...
Blimey!
Signal fire off the starboard bow!
Signal fire!
Starboard bow!
Cap'n?
Cap'n, wake up!
You wakey, wakey!
Ah!
Attack!
Board the ship.
Take no prisoners.
Oh.
Oh, Bosun, it's you!
Yeah.
Sorry to be wake you, Cap'n, but there's a signal fire on a small, uncharted island off the starboard side.
What course of action shall we be taking?
Let me have a look.
Hmm.
Some sort of house on fire.
What's this?
Fire a broadside, drive those bloody beasts off!
Aye, aye, Cap'n.
Then go and bring back whoever he is.
And Bosun, make sure they leave nothing behind of any value.
Will do, Cap'n.
Oh...
Humans?
What's yer go-by, fellow?
Crusoe...
Robinson Crusoe.
Oh, looks like them wild beasts nearly had ya for dinner!
Lucky we found ya when we did.
No, they are my...
Hold on a second, lad!
Let's have a look in there.
Aw!
Not a single gold tooth in his head.
On.
Pity-
Pirates?
You be one lucky bloke.
Crusoe, is it?
I'm in your debt, Captain.
Nay, 'twas me eagle-eyed night watch who done saved your hide.
Away with ya, you blasted bird!
No, Captain, he's with me.
No, Captain, he's with me!
A talking parrot?
What skulduggery is this?
Taught him to talk yourself, did ya?
Yes, Captain.
Drink up!
That'll stir your stumps, mate.
Now, tell me more about this island of yourn.
Is there anything of, shall we say, value on it?
All I can say is that I was shipwrecked, marooned, fending for myself with nothing but time and very few skills to survive.
Sorry about that.
I see the bird has taught you how to drink as well.
That's not very polite, Tuesday.
You'll have to wait outside, I'm afraid.
Fending for myself?
Really?
Listen, you two want to hear the true tale of Robinson Crusoe?
Oh!
Oh, sure.
We're all ears, or at least Cecil here is.
Hey, come on, Ruf.
It all began like every other day before Crusoe came to my island.
Just another day in paradise.
Every day was the same.
Beautiful turquoise water, blue skies and lots of delicious fruit.
Mmm.
Sounds perfect, right?
Boring if you ask me.
How much paradise can a bird take?
I really wanted to get off this island.
Let's see what's been washed up today?
Of course, more of these.
Oh!
What's this?
This could be promising.
- Hey, guys!
It's luau time!
- Yeah, yeah.
Be right there.
Yee-haa!
Oh!
Hi, Rosie!
Check out these delicious treats!
Gorgeous.
Just gorgeous!
Just look at all those bugs.
Mmm.
The beetles are the best.
Crunchy on the outside with a soft, gooey centre.
Hey!
Where did it go?
- My kind of bug.
- You thief!
Carmello, that wasn't very nice.
Aren't you joining us for our luau today, Mak?
We're all here.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I'll...
I'll be right there.
Do we really need a luau every day?
So what did you bring today?
I'm not sure what it is.
I meant food for the luau.
Of course he didn't bring anything for the luau.
Oh, this is beautiful!
Hey, guys, guys!
I think I really found something important this time!
Check this out!
Where?
What?
Scrubby, you're really going blind.
Over here.
Ooh, smells delicious.
No, Scrubby, no.
It's not food!
It's proof that there's more to the world than just our island!
Here we go again.
It's true!
Can't we just eat in peace for once?
Sure, no problem, as long as you can tell me where this came from!
- From the water.
- I vote for Carmello.
I too vote for Carmello.
I too vote for Carmello!
Oh, come on, this isn't an election!
This thingamabobble is... is... ls what?
You know what I think, Mak?
That thingy is whatever you want to believe it is.
Exactly.
You are one hopeless dreamer.
Did you forget you almost died of exhaustion flying across the ocean looking for this other world of yours?
My dear macaw, you must wake up and smell the papaya, for this is the world!
I don't care what you guys say.
There's a bigger world out there and I intend to find it.
♪ I ply my trade for the Union Jack
♪ Upon the seven seas
♪ And unless I eat some rancid meat... ♪ Bury me soul with a mermaid, please ♪
Look, boyos!
Our wannabe map-maker's a bit green around the gills!
We ain't hankerin' to be sharin' your lunch with ya, lad.
Sorry, I'm not much of a sailor.
You got that right.
If you're fixin' to upchuck, find your way downwind!
Ah.
Oh...
Your poor stomach...
Just ye wait till ya get one of them strange islands and ya meet your first cannibals!
Cannibals?
We made our choice to go to sea, right, Aynsley, old pal?
And I swear, I'll not regret it.
Whoa!
All right.
Go and bring me something to eat!
Right, lovey.
I won't fail you.
Hey, which of you lucky clucks wants to join me for a little snack?
Here, chicky, chicky!
Come on, now, no need to be shy, my plump little...
What business might you be having above decks?
Oh, I was, uh, just making sure my chicken food... friends were... were fresh.
No, warm.
Warm and comfy.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Hold on!
Don't get your fur all in a knot.
So, then, where were we?
Knock it off!
You cats belong down below.
And stay away from our chickens!
And that goes for you as well!
Who does that green-gilled landlubber think he is?
Uh, the human who threw us into the hold?
This is our ship!
Wretched as it is, it's home!
Mark my word, Mal, someday, somehow, that canine and his human will pay!
I'm with ya there, May.
They'll pay, all right.
Uh, how much exactly are we charging 'em?
That should teach them to mess with our egg supply, huh, old boy?
Eggs.
Oh, no, not again.
Buck up, boyo.
Ah, looks like we've got one doozy of a storm brewin'.
So much for a peaceful meal.
- Whoa!
- Oh!
Oh, nobody saw that one coming!
- Whoa!
- Hang on, Carmello.
Perhaps it would be wise to move this soiree to the cave.
Let's get moving.
This is going to be a nasty one.
I'm with you on that call.
And Mak, grab the pineapple!
Like we really needed this pineapple.
All hands on deck!
Get them sails down!
And secure the yardarms tight!
Get yourself below, mate!
Best you ride out the storm there!
Ah!
Oh!
Ah!
Aynsley!
I got you!
Oh!
Hey!
Hey!
Help!
Help!
Look out!
- Runaway pineapple!
- Whoa!
Oh!
Sorry, Pango.
Careful, Scrubby!
- I got it!
Whoa...
- Scrubby!
Help!
Quick!
Rosie, the tree!
Easy, Scrubby, don't panic!
OK, I got ya now!
Well, come on, you old goat!
Get your hooves moving!
We ain't got all day!
That's it, easy.
Don't be afraid, one step at a time...
Whoa...
Scrubby!
- Help!
- He's not going to make it!
Do something!
Carmello, grab him.
I got...
You!
H-H-H-Help!
Help!
We're in here!
Someone help!
Help!
Ah!
Ah!
Whoa...
Oh...
No, no.
Ah!
Away!
Payback time!
I can't hold on, Mello!
This is the end, little buddy.
There's not much time!
They're gonna fall!
Hold steady!
I'm coming, mates!
Pango, what are you doing?
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
Whoa!
How's it going, mate?
Nice try, Pango, but it's hopeless.
I'm a goner.
Mak!
Oh!
Hold on, hold on, hold on.
Oh.
Come on, come on, come on.
I'll get you guys out of there!
Ah!
We have to do something!
- Oops!
- Oh, no.
- Mak!
Look out!
- Ouch!
- Mak!
- Oh...
This just went from bad to worse.
Don't worry, guys, that branch looks pretty solid to me.
Right, but how do we get down?
You got me there.
Oh, I can't believe it.
They're alive!
It's a miracle!
Hey. anybody want some pineapple?
Whoa, whoa!
Did you hear that sound?
- What's out there, Mak?
- I have no idea.
I've never heard a sound like that before.
Can you see anything?
Not a thing.
Unfortunately, we're going to have to wait until morning.
Same old stuff.
Shells and more shells.
Small ones, big ones...
That's a new taste.
Earthy, with a slight touch of salt.
Come on.
Come to papa.
Huh?
Hey, Scrubs, what did you find?
What is it you're eating?
I don't know but it's delicious.
Aw, Scrubs!
You know I collect stuff like this.
My nose tells me there's more goodies up at Rocky Point.
Look at that!
Woolly c-c-caterpillars!
See?
I was right.
This is the most incredible proof that there's another world out there!
No.
Look behind you.
What are you talking about?
Behind me?
Ah!
I can't believe it.
It's the thing we heard dying last night.
What do you think it is?
The other world.
I've got to get a closer look.
Mak, don't!
We have no idea what it is.
It's too dangerous, Mak!
But this is amazing!
I was right!
I knew it, I knew it.
I knew it!
This is from the other world!
I have never seen anything like this!
Incredible!
Huh?
Ah!
- Mak should be more careful.
- Pangy's right.
We should keep our distance.
What's going on?
Easy now, whatever you are.
I just want to talk.
Sea monsters.
Wow!
Look at this.
There's hardly any ship left, Aynsley.
Hello!
Is anyone out there?
- Hey!
Can anyone hear me?
- Ooh.
Look at it.
Captain!
Bosun!
- Anyone?
- It's... hideous!
Where did they all go?
I can't believe everyone is really gone.
Looks like there's just the two of us.
Let's go to shore.
Hang on, Aynsley, the current's really strong.
Uh-oh.
Oh, land, sweet land!
Oh.
It's so good to be alive, Aynsley.
Bob's your uncle, sea monsters walking on land?
Uh-oh, we're in big trouble.
Only one thing has two legs.
A bird!
And that ain't no bird I've ever seen.
Yeah.
He can't even fly.
That monster is going to eat Carmello!
What's going on, Aynsley?
We gotta do something, now!
Hurry, make as much noise as you can.
We have to scare those sea monsters off!
Come back here, Aynsley!
Stay close together.
We don't know what's out there.
What was that?
Aynsley!
Aynsley, what's that noise?
Ah!
Cannibals, Aynsley, Cannibals!
We have to get off this island!
The sailor warned us.
They'll skin us alive and eat us!
Hurry, old boy.
They're coming for us!
Uh, get inside the barrel.
Go, boy, go.
There.
Yes.
Guys, guys, guys.
What are you doing?
Scaring off the sea monsters, thank you very much.
And what if they aren't sea monsters?
Did you see the furry one's teeth?
He'll rip us to shreds!
Everybody calm down!
We're safe here.
Are we?
We really don't know what those creatures are capable of!
I know one thing they're capable of, leaving the island!
What?
Oh, no!
Come on, this can't be happening to me.
He's actually leaving.
We did it!
We got rid of him.
Yeah, we scared them big time!
Will somebody tell me what's happening?
I'll tell you what's going on.
You guys have ruined my chance to get off this island and see the world.
You really don't get it, do you?
You think this paradise.
Well, it is not!
It meant so much to me.
- He's back.
- Oh, no, here we go again.
Back?
Are you serious?
Let me see!
Here's what we're going to do.
We stay out of sight and we keep an eye on them, see what they plan on doing.
OK?
OK, then.
Nobody goes on the beach.
That goes for you, too, Scrubby.
Yeah, yeah.
I heard ya.
Didn't even get to finish my breakfast.
All those new smells are driving me crazy!
I gotta go check it out.
Where you going, Scrubby?
Psst!
Come back.
It's not safe out there.
Can't let all those tasty morsels get washed away.
If I recall correctly, didn't Mak say we should all stay out of sight?
He did!
Speaking of which, where is Mak?
Sorry about today, old friend.
That was a pretty inept attempt.
Oh, what was I thinking?
I haven't the foggiest idea where we are, nor, for that matter, the slightest inkling in which direction to set sail.
Someone's bound to come and save us, old boy.
I'm sure of it.
If those cannibals come back, we'll be ready for them.
Who's out there?
Show yourselves!
My dog'll tear you to shreds!
And I have a musket!
Huh?
A goat?
It's just a goat.
And a bird.
Maybe there aren't any cannibals after all.
Mak, what were you doing out there all by yourself?
I thought you said we should stay hidden?
I was just checking things out is all.
What's all the commotion about, anyway?
Well, Epi just made a good point.
I just suggested, hypothetically, that possibly the sea monster lost that thingamajig you found.
And maybe he's come to get it back!
Along with us!
It's one of two things for sure, a coincidence or a bad omen.
Either way, you need to get rid of it.
Why not just give it back to the sea monsters?
Peachy idea.
No way!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa...
- You're kidding?
You're so selfish!
Selfish?
OK.
Uh, maybe.
Just give me time to think about it.
But if I do give it back, you're all coming with me.
Well.
All right, then, Aynsley, we've got some work to do.
Let's save whatever we can before it is all lost to the sea.
How's it looking, mate?
They're taking over our beach.
He's pulling strange stuff out from the sea.
I suppose this means they're not leaving any time soon, then?
Looks that way.
Do you see how the four-legged one sleeps all day while the big one does the work?
No, but I'll take your word for it.
I'll bet ya the sleeping one's the boss.
Look, he stripped off his skin!
Ugh, I'm going to be sick.
None of us knew it at the time, but we were being watched by the real monsters on the island.
Some luck, huh, May?
That green-gilled human and his mangy mutt made it safely here.
How are we gonna deal with him?
He might be a problem for us.
Don't you worry.
I'll figure out a way to get rid of them quick enough.
For the time being, we sit, watch and wait.
Aw, come on, May, I'm starving here.
And what did I just say?
Sit.
Watch.
Wait.
That's right.
Now, stay focused!
We've got the upper claw.
No one knows we're here.
Which means we take our time and we pick them off one by one.
Ah, look, Aynsley!
These could come in very handy.
I'd better practice a bit before we venture out there to get our dinner, right, boy?

Steady...
- What's he doing?
- Shh.
Pull back the hammer and...
I don't know about you, Scrubby, but I plan on staying as far away from that monster as possible.
What was that all about?
I have absolutely no idea.
But what we need to find out is what these newcomer's intentions are.
From the sound of it, they're up to no good.
Obviously they're trying to kill us.
Maybe.
But maybe not.
The truth of the matter is that these newcomers have brought nothing but trouble to our paradise.
That is a fact.
Fine.
Then do like I asked and stay out of sight.
They're proof that there's another world out there and I'm going to find out whether they're friend or foe.
You really don't get it, do you?
Whoa!
That was close.
OK, let's give this a go one last time.
Ah!
Did you see that, Aynsley?
I did it!
I hit the mark!
Let's go fix something to eat, old boy.
That was a miracle, I never thought I'd hit it!
Well, maybe we'll eat something after all.
I was starting to wonder if everyone wasn't right.
The new world was finally here and I had no idea if I was ready for it or not.
Mmm...
That's the biggest rat I've ever seen.
Go for the throat, let's make this quick.
Wait, the human!
Oh, I can't do it, boy.
Go on!
Shoo!
Go!
What now?
Sorry, pal, I've never shot anything before.
What say we try fishing?
What's burning?
U-
That would be me.
You smell like burnt biscuits.
Shh!
Something's coming.
Looks like Rosie was here.
That's strange, Rosie never leaves any food behind.
Oh!
Oh, no.
Would you prefer white or dark meat for brunch, darling?
I prefer...
Dog!
Time to get even, ratter!
Hold on, Aynsley!
I'm coming!
Those blasted ratters, they did survive after all!
Ah, I'm hit!
Run for it!
Good dog.
You all right, old boy?
Did you hear that?
Over there.
Oh, look, it's a bird, a beautiful parrot.
So, Aynsley, that's what all the fuss was about.
Those ratters were after the bird.
You've done good, old boy.
And you...
We're going to fix you up straight away.
Look, Aynsley, a ring!
That can only mean one thing.
Sailors have set foot on this island before.
I believe there's hope for us after all.
You can come out guys, there's no one around.
It's too dark, I can't see a thing.
This is the very spot where that sea monster attacked me.
Well, sort of.
Oh, are muse...
We shouldn't have let him go alone.
Maybe he's moulting.
Oh, that's a bit of a stretch, Pango.
Just wait till I get my hooves on them.
Any way you look at it, this is not good.
Mak can't be gone.
What's that?
And who are you two?
Just two homeless castaways.
We were held captive by that human for months with nothing to eat but the crumbs from his table.
What about our friend?
Did you see him, by any chance?
Oh, 'tis a true tragedy, all right.
Oh, an unfortunate turn of events.
You see, we caused...
We saw the whole thing.
Well, come on, let's hear it.
What are you waiting for?
We'll tell you what happened to your friend but I'm warning ya, it ain't pretty.
You see, the human loves to eat birds and I am afraid your friend got...
Trapped.
Mmm-hmm.
This should only take a minute.
It's just dislocated.
But it's going to hurt a bit...
Don't worry, you'll feel better in a day or two, though you won't be able to fly right away.
Well, then,
I suppose you'll need a name if you're going to stay here for a while.
Let's see.
By my reckoning, today's Tuesday.
That's as good a name as any, eh?
Can you say Tuesday?
Tuesday?
Well, not quit.
But that's a start.
Take care of our new friend, boy.
I'd better offload as much stuff as I can.
No telling how long the ship will stay in one piece.
They're nothing but cannibals!
Murderers!
I say we run 'em off our island!
Drive them monsters back into the sea!
Perhaps a plan might be to force them to live on Curse Island!
Yeah!
Oh, yes, yes, yes!
Curse Island!
Uh, what exactly is Curse Island?
Ooh!
The end of the earth, mate.
No one's ever made it back from there.
Yeah.
There's nothing there but bugs.
Lots and lots of nasty bugs.
Sounds perfect.
Drive them to Curse Island.
That's not going to work.
You have a better idea?
Uh, no.
Right.
So, then, where were we?
Stop your flapping about, bird.
You need to be resting that wing of yours.
What do you want from me?
I just want to talk.
The name's Aynsley, and from what I understand, yours is Tuesday.
Call me whatever you want, except dinner.
Dinner?
We're not going to eat you.
We saved your life!
Either way, you'll not make much of a meal.
Not like the fat, juicy turkeys we have back home.
Relax, my master likes you.
You said your master?
You did not think that I...
Oh, I like you.
You're funny.
I've never seen a bird like you in England.
Eng-land.
Tell me more, Aynsley.
Aye, laddie.
England, my island, just one fantastic place in a sea of many lands.
I knew it!
Crusoe wants to explore them all.
If we ever get off this one.
You know, you're the first to come from the outside world.
Oh, dear, that's not good news.
Uh, hold on a second.
We're made up like this because...
Because you look fierce.
Now, get your heads in the game, everyone!
We have the perfect opportunity.
The dog and that bird are still on the ship.
Right.
Listen up!
Here's the plan.
We'll deal with the hairy beast on the ship.
The rest of you go for the human on the beach.
What's a ship?
That wooden thing on the beach.
As soon as we're on the ship, the wooden thing, you attack!
Right, then.
Fierce, fierce, fierce.
So, I'm a fierce coconut?
I should go tell my friends that I'm OK.
You'd better stay put, you're in no condition to fly.
Well, look at this.
We can kill two birds with one stone.
Hmm?
There's two birds now?
Oh, shut it!
Just follow my lead.
Look, look!
That tail feather.
He's wearing Mak like a trophy!
That is so wrong!
Attack!
Let's get him!
Whoa...
Yee-haw!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Aysnley, we'd better go.
What's going on out there?
They've all gone mad.
- Ah!
- It appears as if your friends
- have come to avenge your death.
- I'm not dead.
Oh, we're going to take care of that right now!
Aynsley!
Help!
I have had it with you!
Ah!
Aynsley!
Whoa...
Come on down, then!
Get off me!
Aynsley!
Tuesday?
- Hold on!
That sounded like...
- Mak!
Aynsley!
Mak, get out!
Kiki!
Mak.
I'm coming, boy!
Rotten cats!
You're to blame for all this!
You must leave the ship now.
Go!
- Aynsley!
- Go!
What's happening here?
I thought Mak was dead.
We all did, but I don't think he made it this time.
That would be horrible!
Come on, guys, we'd better move back now.
Oh, no!
Aynsley.
What have I done'?
Land.
Land!
We're saved, May!
I thought we were goners.
Oh, will you just shut up?
What's that noise?
- That would be bugs.
- Bugs!
Curse Island!
Rest in peace, old boy.
Tuesday!
Psst!
Mak!
Kiki!
- Mak, you're hurt.
- I'll be OK.
I'm sure glad to see you.
- I was worried!
- Me, too.
Come on, now's your chance to get away.
- I can't.
- Let me help you.
No, no...
I...
I just...
I don't want to get away.
What?
You don't understand.
It's all those cats' fault.
- What do you mean?
- They attacked me.
He fixed my wing.
And his dog gave his life to save me.
I can't leave him now.
Oh, I see.
So, he's going to take care of you?
Look, he's going to need my help to survive.
I owe him that.
Exactly how do you plan on doing that?
I mean, look at him!
Tuesday, help!
I don't believe it.
Those cats used us and Mak as well and what do we do?
We attack the human.
Hold on, then.
So what you're saying is Kiki's to blame for all this?
- Oh, afraid so!
- That's not fair.
We all thought Mak was dead.
Didn't we?
Oh, this is not good, mates.
Yeah.
We've made a real mess of things.
Ah, it looks that way, Epi, gal.
Where you going, Rosie?
Off to clean up our mess!
I'm in.
Well, let's get cracking then, mates!
Wait a second!
You're going to make an even bigger mess of things.
The wild beasts!
They're going to get us!
Stay right where you are.
I've got a special treat for all of you.
Oh.
I just want to give you some biscuits is all.
They're quite good.
I finished off your dog, human, and I promise, one day, you and the rest of your lot will join him.
Now, that is the taste of desperation.
Try the red ones.
They taste just like chicken.
Mmm!
What...
What?
Do you want to show me something?
All right.
All right, let's go.
Oh, Tuesday, this is fantastic!
Fresh water!
Good job, Tuesday.
What?
You want me to follow you?
OK, I'm coming.
Hey, guys, look who's here.
Relax, there's nothing to be afraid of.
Stay right where you are.
I'll be right back.
What got into him?
- Why is he running away?
- Beats me.
- Maybe it's your smell.
- Huh?
Try one of these, it's really good.
And some for you.
Enjoy!
Say, Tuesday, where is pretty bird?
I haven't seen her yet.
Pretty bird!
No need to yell, Mak, I mean, Tuesday.
I'm right here.
There you are, pretty bird.
Here, you see?
I won't hurt you.
Come on, don't be afraid.
Come on, pretty bird.
Ouch!
Well, friendships aren't made in a day.
We'll take it one step at a time, right, Tuesday?
One step.
I can't, May.
The current's too strong.
- So you failed again, did you?
- Oh...
Oh, stop feeling sorry for yourself.
Our time will come.
Soon there will be more of us.
Revenge will be sweet.
Oh!
Ah!
Oh!
That hurt.
Why, you can't see a bloody thing, can you, you old goat?
We're going to have to fix that.
There you are.
That should help.
Whoo-hoo!
Why, Rosie, you're no pig.
Hey!
What's gotten into you?
You're gorgeous!
Easy. big boy.
Whoo!
Oh!
Ow!
Oh.
Oh, no!
Whoa!
No, no, no, no, no!
No, no.
Ah!
Oh!
No.
Oh, no!
Tuesday, help!
Hey. guys!
Oh, never mind.
This is hopeless.
How am I ever going to survive on this island?
Yes, of course, that's it!
I have to build a treehouse.
Ha-ha!
It's raining tree limbs.
Ooh.
Hmm, tastes good enough to eat.
Is there anything you wouldn't eat?
Hey, Pango.
What's he doing?
Don't know, mate.
This cobber's gone b-b-bonkers on us.
He's destroying the tree!
Must keep sawing...
Need to finish shelter.
Must build...
Mmm.
Ah!
Yes, sir.
More porridge, please.
We had no clue what Crusoe was up to.
Sawing?
Porridge?
Yep, as Pango would say, he was bonkers to the max.
How are you coming along, May?
Can I have just a little a peek'?
Can you just wait?
I'm cleaning them up.
Well, could you at least tell me how big a litter we have?
More than we'll ever be able to feed, I'm afraid.
Oh, look at it...
Hey!
Ow!
That smarts.
I'm trying to work here.
Go eat somewhere else.
At this rate, I'll never get this built.
I told you, go!
Ah, never mind.
What I wouldn't give for an extra set of hands.
For all his pounding and sawing, we couldn't figure out what he was actually doing.
Whoa!
Now what is going on?
Argh, really?
I couldn't blame Rosie.
When you've got an itch, you've gotta scratch it!
But poor Crusoe, he didn't see it that way.
He had had enough.
And that's when it hit me!
A nest!
- Mmm-mmm.
- Hey, guys!
I figured out what he's doing.
Uh, making a mess?
No.
He's building a shelter!
Huh?
Don't follow ya, mate.
He's building a nest!
- A nest?
- So he is a bird.
Scrubs.
He's building a human nest in the tree!
Oh!
Pretty clever!
I've never slept in a tree.
If he stocks it with food, you'll sleep in a tree.
Good point!
So, guys, I got an idea.
What do ya say we help him out, get this nest of his built?
I must have been crazy thinking I could build this all by my... self.
We didn't really have any idea what we were getting into.
We just figured let's help, use whatever abilities we had and hoped it all worked.
Well, I'll be gobsmacked!
Slowly, slowly.
Slowly, slowly.
That's it, just a little more.
Hi, Epi!
Where are you headed with all that food?
Whoa!
I need a little help here, guys!
- Easy.
- Hmm, salty.
Not that kind of help.
No, no.
That tickles!
Epi, hold up.
I'm starving!
Whoa!
Help!
Things didn't always go smoothly.
And we had our ups and downs, that's for sure.
But everyone was in fine spirits.
And Crusoe seemed, well, happy.
He made a funny little door for Epi and Pango to get into the nest.
It was a pretty good idea.
After a few modifications, that is.
We became a real team, playing all these funny games Crusoe came up with.
He had all sorts of crazy ideas.
Oh!
Like hiding seeds in the ground.
Crusoe had a funny way of eating.
He peeled the fruit.
And boy, did he eat slow.
Ah!
It took quite a while, but despite his awkwardness and all of his flaws,
Crusoe surprised even the most sceptical among us.
That's it, that's it.
Watch your step.
I just put the finishing touches on our new home.
New home.
Hold it right there.
First thing we must do is christen the place.
It's good luck, you know.
I christen thee...
Oh!
Oh, never mind.
Three cheers for us.
Wow!
Now, look at that.
It's so beautiful!
Hip, hip, hooray!
What in the world is that noise he's making?
- Sounds like Scrubby when he needs food!
- Hmm!
It's painful, mates.
Let's get outta here.
Oh!
Personally, I think it sounds beautiful.
A party and we weren't invited.
Mal!
Quit your daydreaming.
I am starving here!
Oh, coming.
You know how difficult it is in my condition to hunt right now.
Have you tried to make it to the other island lately?
Oh, May.
You know the last time I tried I almost drowned.
I'm afraid we're stuck with just the bugs and spiders.
They sound delicious.
Now, go and hunt some up for me.
Right, darling.
I'll wrap 'em in seaweed just the way you like 'em.
With the nest completed, Crusoe moved on to a new project.
We didn't have to forage for food, we had this great nest.
And we even had indoor plumbing!
Paradise just got better.
That human sure has made life peachy for us.
Rosie, he's bonzer to the max.
I tell ya, old girl, if this new world Mak talks about is this cushy, it may not be that bad after all.
Getting a little plump, aren't we?
Sitting around all day.
Ain't nothing wrong with a few curves, Kiki, honey.
With Crusoe doing the fishing, we'll be putting some curves on you too in no time, Kiki.
Ooh, what do we have here?
Hmm.
Looks like Crusoe is going to put your fishing skills to shame, Kiki.
As time passed, life became more and more comfortable for us all.
Yet Crusoe seemed very sad at times.
He missed his old world.
He built a strange tower an the highest point of the island, with bright lights burning every night.
Another day, no ships in sight, little fella.
What I wouldn't give to see the sun set over the Thames.
Thames?
Come on, partner.
I don't get it.
Why does he light this every night?
In the hope that some other humans will pass by.
If they see the signal, they'll come and rescue him.
I knew the chances of leaving this island were becoming slimmer as time went by.
I just didn't know how slim.
More humans on our island?
That's not going to happen.
And now, my friends, like all good Englishmen, a moment of silence to give thanks for this bountiful harvest.
Psst!
Mind your manners.
- Our host is...
- Taking a snooze, it appears.
Or worse.
Psst!
Hey, stop fooling around.
At least we're not out in that weather.
Oh, it's miserable out there.
Listen to you guys!
We're meant to live in the weather.
Have you all gone soft?
Whoa, whoa, Kiki.
Why get so worked up?
Oh, you haven't seen worked up.
Answer me this.
What happens to us when Crusoe leaves this island?
I mean, have you thought of that?
Kiki, now...
Now, listen.
Oh, I'm listening.
I'm listening loud and clear, Mak!
Shall we eat'?
If I could just find one little morsel.
One measly little morsel.
It's mine!
It's all mine!
Mine, mine, mine, mine!
- What's yours?
- Nothing.
You wouldn't be depriving your family, now, would you, sweetheart?
Yes.
I mean no.
Oh!
Oh, May, that hurts.
Shame on you!
I should...
Look, the ship's falling apart.
Our luck is turning.
Maybe we'll be able to make it back to the main island after all.
Hey, what do you say we go outside and have some fun on the waterslide?
Great idea!
I love all the smells after a good rain.
I'll catch up with you guys later.
I'd better find Kiki first, make sure she's all right.
Why didn't that ship just vanish into the sea?
Our lives are never going to be the same again.
Shall we have a little snack before we move on to the main island?
Oh!
Help!
Scream all you want, little bird.
No one's going to save you now.
I'll be the son of a sea cook!
Watch out, children, it's the human!
Get your filthy paws off my bird!
Epi, Pango, to the left.
We'd better get out of here, quick!
Come on, everyone, we've got them surrounded!
Attack!
Ka-boom!
Oh, he got me.
If this is heaven, why are you here?
They're heading for the big island!
They're everywhere!
It's all my fault!
We have to warn the others!
Get to the nest!
Now, hurry!
- Predators!
- What?
Did he say predators?
Oh, no!
Hang on, everyone, I'll get my musket.
Oh!
Batten down the hatches!
Batten down the hatches!
I just need a little powder and then some shot.
That's it, Tuesday, close everything up.
Ow!
Ah!
They're everywhere!
Get off of me!
Ah!
Ah!
Stay away, you bloody ratters!
Tuesday, ah!
Help!
Get me down from here!
I may not know human but that's "help" in any language.
Carmello!
Crusoe needs our help.
Oh!
Ah!
Uh-oh!
Oh, duck!
Ooh!
Hurry, Epi!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Oh!
Yee-haa!
Uh-oh.
Pango!
Over here!
Jump!
- Stand back, Epi!
- Ooh!
Hurry!
He's right behind you!
Yee-haa!
Go. go!
I need my musket.
Now look what you've done!
You guys stay put!
Oh, not again!
Stay away, you mangy cat!
Hang on, Crusoe!
Good job, buddy.
Huh?
That wasn't so bad.
Keep pushing.
I'll take care of these blighters!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Pango!
Help!
Whoa!
That's awful high.
Come on, you can make it.
Jump!
Oh, my.
Here goes.
Ooh!
- Oh, dear.
- Good work!
Now, let's get out of here.
OK.
So long, furball!
Hungry, are we?
Well, then, take that!
And how about a banana?
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
So long, Knucklehead!
Scrubby, the door!
Come on!
My turn!
Hello there.
Many thanks, Scrubs.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Over here, Epi, girl!
Get in the bucket!
Going up!
Pango, get him off!
Get off, you mangy cat!
Good work, Epi!
They'll never get me.
We got rid of 'em, didn't we?
Epi!
Pango!
Huh?
Whoa!
Help me.
Look out behind you, Epi!
Whoa!
Whoa!
- Help!
- No!
Epi!
Hang on, I'm coming!
Whoa!
Let go of me!
The cats are trying to get in through the hatch!
No!
Rosie, no, that was Crusoe.
- Oops!
- Help me get this open.
Oh, I hope you didn't hurt him.
Oh!
Everybody OK?
Everybody except Crusoe.
Come on guys, all together.
It's heavy.
Spread out, Rosie.
We need all the muscle we can muster!
Really?
OK, OK.
One, two, three!
Well, that's a bit of a bummer, mates.
We need Crusoe!
How's he doing, Kiki?
He's alive but he won't be of any use to us.
We're going to need a miracle to hold all these cats back.
I got it.
The musket!
Watch out, guys, it's going to be noisy!
Are you sure that's a good idea?
It's worth a try.
What else can we do?
Uh-huh.
This could be a bit more complicated than I thought.
Hmm, the human's out.
Time to make our move.
Hurry!
We can't hold them off much longer.
He always pulls that thingamajig back first!
OK, get ready.
Huh?
That's weird.
Hmm.
What's happening in there?
Hey, Tuesday, maybe this thingy has something to do with it.
What thingy?
Ah!
Now what?
You know they're going to come back!
Maybe Crusoe will come to and save us.
I hate to break it to you guys.
We're on our own.
We have to get out of here, hide someplace.
What about Crusoe?
Pango's right!
We can't leave him here.
Guys, guys, it may not be perfect, but I think I've got a plan.
Well, you'd better lay it out, cos we're out of time.
All right, children, calm down.
They just got lucky this time.
We're going to sneak up on them and make them pay.
Now let's show them what we're made of!
Oh. yeah!
Aw, you've got a broken wing, have you?
Don't worry.
We'll put you out of my misery.
Stay back or I'll shoot!
Not so brave now, are you?
Uh-oh!
Appears your luck has just run out.
Oh!
Whoa!
You'll have to be quicker than that, ratter!
Get him!
He can't fly!
That should take care of you quite nicely.
Sweet dreams from your favourite ratter.
Get ready!
- We got him cornered, May.
- Then, let's finish him off once and for all.
Catch me if you can, ratter!
Whoa!
Hold on!
Rosie, stop!
We have to wait for the signal.
This is it, give it all you have, Rosie!
- Huh?
What's going on?
- They tricked us.
Hold on to that tail, I'll take care of him.
We're not so cocky any more, are we?
Tuesday's in trouble!
Ah!
Oh, ho!
That was a bonzer plan you had there, mate.
Couldn't have done it without you guys.
Huh?
The fire!
Crusoe!
Crusoe!
Over here.
Ouch, that must have really hurt!
We pulled Crusoe out to safety, unconscious but alive.
And then, out of the blue, we get cannon-blasted from your ship.
Aye.
The Captain can be one tough bloke.
What do you expect?
They're pirates, after all.
Pirates?
You know, like them nasty ratters, only worse.
I had a pack of crazed cats on my right.
I was sure I was a goner!
I took my musket in one hand, my sword in the other and carved a swath to the savage hordes.
Whoa!
It was horrible, Captain!
That is the most fantastical yarn I've heard in all me life!
'Tis no yarn, Captain.
Mmm.
So you say.
Well, then, 'tis time to set sail.
You and your bird can take a bunk below.
Oh, Captain.
I cannot tell you how I long to see England again.
England?
We'll not be sailing for them ports.
Lest we want to be hanging from the gallows.
Right, me mates?
But you see...
We...
I must...
Can you at least drop me off a bit closer to home?
You're with us now.
Once a pirate, always a pirate.
Have you got a problem with that?
- But Captain, if I might...
- Enough talk!
Off with ya!
And I'll be expectin' ya to carry your weight, lad.
Or you'll be walkin' the plank, ye will,
OI' worse.
Look!
ls it a mirage, May?
It's not a mirage, you idiot!
It's a ship!
Children, start paddling!
♪ I ply my trade for the Union Jack
♪ Upon the seven seas
♪ And unless I eat some rancid... ♪
Hey, give it here!
That be my rum ye be drinkin'!
Oh, you want some rum, do ya?
How's me fists instead?
These are some nasty pirates.
It won't end well, I'm afraid, if we stay another moment.
Hey!
What you be fixin' to do there?
Oh, nothing.
Nothing at all.
Is that right?
That ingrate we done rescued from the island is trying to steal one of our rowboats!
If anybody gonna be stealing anything, it be us!
No, I was just...
Hey!
What's going on out here?
Bosun, he's trying to jump ship.
Get him and throw him in the brig.
Right!
Let's teach him a lesson.
Take that!
Go get him!
Hey, he's gettin' away!
Grab him!
Ha, give me a piece of him!
There's no way off this ship, you fool!
Ah!
Whoa!
Whoa!
- Get him!
- Tuesday!
- He's mine!
- I'll grab him.
Whoa!
A raft!
You fools couldn't hit the broadside of a barn!
Come on, lads, show me what ye be made of.
Bosun!
Get your scurvy excuse for a pirate down to my cabin!
Now!
Aye, aye, Cap'n.
Right away!
And the rest of you fools, back to work before I give you each ten lashes of me whip!
Blasted bird.
Cap'n, he's getting away!
- Shall we send some men after him?
- Nay.
Let him go.
Oh, Captain!
Can't we fire a cannon shot, blow him to smithereens'?
Why waste a good cannonball?
Let him spend the rest of his life on that long-forgotten island.
That is, if the wild beasts don't devour him first.
Aye, aye, Captain!
It's been nice knowing ya, Ruf.
We did have ourselves a good run there, didn't we, Cec?
Jump!
I wasn't going to let those ratters get you.
We friends gotta stick together.
Nice of you to think so.
Where we be headed off to, then?
We're going home.

(GRUNTING)
A tisket, a tasket, a biscuit for me breakfast... (STRAINING) Come on, Cec, stop your blabbing.
We're...
Almost there!
(GRUNTING)
Look, Rufus, shadow puppets.
(GIGGLING)
(THUDDING)
I haven't had me breakfast yet, either.
(BOTH GASPING) Ratter!
(TOMCAT GROWLING)
(MEOWING)
Whoa!
(WHIMPERING)
(PANTING)
Shadow puppets?
Seriously, mate, you are one kidney short of a meat pie!
Uh, I was just...
- (GROWLING)
- Ah!
(SNORING)
- (GASPS) What the...
Oh!
- (MEOWING)
Get off of me, ya good-for-nothing fleabag of a cat!
(WHIMPERS AND SCREAMS)
A sailor can't even get a night's sleep without some...
Blimey!
Signal fire off the starboard bow!
Signal fire!
Starboard bow!
(SNORING CONTINUES)
Cap'n?
Cap'n, wake up!
You wakey, wakey!
Ah!
Attack!
Board the ship.
Take no prisoners.
(MUMBLING) Oh.
Oh, Bosun, it's you!
Yeah.
Sorry to be wake you, Cap'n, but there's a signal fire on a small, uncharted island off the starboard side.
What course of action shall we be taking?
Let me have a look.
Hmm.
Some sort of house on fire.
What's this?
Fire a broadside, drive those bloody beasts off!
Aye, aye, Cap'n.
Then go and bring back whoever he is.
And Bosun, make sure they leave nothing behind of any value.
Will do, Cap'n.
(LAUGHING)
Oh... (BOTH LAUGHING)
(GASPS) Humans?
What's yer go-by, fellow?
Crusoe...
Robinson Crusoe.
Oh, looks like them wild beasts nearly had ya for dinner!
- Lucky we found ya when we did.
- (BOTTLE CLATTERING)
No, they are my...
Hold on a second, lad!
Let's have a look in there.
(CHUCKLING)
Aw!
Not a single gold tooth in his head.
On.
Pity-
Pirates?
(BOTH LAUGHING)
LONG JOHN SILVER:
You be one lucky bloke.
Crusoe, is it?
CRUSOE:
I'm in your debt, Captain.
Nay, 'twas me eagle-eyed night watch who done saved your hide.
(PARROT SQUAWKING)
Away with ya, you blasted bird!
No, Captain, he's with me.
No, Captain, he's with me!
(LAUGHING)
A talking parrot?
What skulduggery is this?
Taught him to talk yourself, did ya?
- Yes, Captain.
- (LIQUID POURING)
Drink up!
That'll stir your stumps, mate.
Now, tell me more about this island of yourn.
Is there anything of, shall we say, value on it?
(COUGHING)
All I can say is that I was shipwrecked, marooned, fending for myself with nothing but time and very few skills to survive.
(GAGGING)
Sorry about that.
I see the bird has taught you how to drink as well. (LAUGHING)
That's not very polite, Tuesday.
You'll have to wait outside, I'm afraid.
Fending for myself?
Really?
(SNIFFING)
Listen, you two want to hear the true tale of Robinson Crusoe?
Oh!
Oh, sure.
We're all ears, or at least Cecil here is. (LAUGHING)
Hey, come on, Ruf.
It all began like every other day before Crusoe came to my island.
Just another day in paradise.
Every day was the same.
Beautiful turquoise water, blue skies and lots of delicious fruit.
Mmm.
Sounds perfect, right?
Boring if you ask me.
How much paradise can a bird take?
I really wanted to get off this island.
Let's see what's been washed up today?
Of course, more of these.
Oh!
What's this?
This could be promising.
(GRUNTING)
- Hey, guys!
It's luau time!
- Yeah, yeah.
Be right there.
(GASPING)
Yee-haa!
(GROANING)
Oh!
Hi, Rosie!
Check out these delicious treats!
Gorgeous.
Just gorgeous!
- (BUGS BUZZING)
- Just look at all those bugs.
(SMACKING LIPS) Mmm.
The beetles are the best.
Crunchy on the outside with a soft, gooey centre.
Hey!
Where did it go?
- My kind of bug.
- You thief!
Carmello, that wasn't very nice.
(CLINKING)
Aren't you joining us for our luau today, Mak?
We're all here.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I'll...
I'll be right there.
(SOFTLY) Do we really need a luau every day?
- KIKI:
So what did you bring today?
- (SIGHING)
I'm not sure what it is.
I meant food for the luau.
(SCOFFS) Of course he didn't bring anything for the luau.
Oh, this is beautiful!
Hey, guys, guys!
I think I really found something important this time!
Check this out!
Where?
What?
Scrubby, you're really going blind.
Over here.
Ooh, smells delicious.
No, Scrubby, no.
It's not food!
It's proof that there's more to the world than just our island!
(SIGHING) Here we go again.
It's true!
Can't we just eat in peace for once?
Sure, no problem, as long as you can tell me where this came from!
- From the water.
- I vote for Carmello.
I too vote for Carmello.
(MOCKING) I too vote for Carmello!
Oh, come on, this isn't an election!
This thingamabobble is... is... ls what?
You know what I think, Mak?
That thingy is whatever you want to believe it is.
Exactly.
You are one hopeless dreamer.
Did you forget you almost died of exhaustion flying across the ocean looking for this other world of yours?
My dear macaw, you must wake up and smell the papaya, for this is the world!
I don't care what you guys say.
There's a bigger world out there and I intend to find it.
♪ I ply my trade for the Union Jack
♪ Upon the seven seas

Look, boyos!
Our wannabe map-maker's a bit green around the gills!
(LAUGHING) We ain't hankerin' to be sharin' your lunch with ya, lad.
Sorry, I'm not much of a sailor.
You got that right.
If you're fixin' to upchuck, find your way downwind!
Ah.
Oh...
Your poor stomach...
Just ye wait till ya get one of them strange islands and ya meet your first cannibals!
(ALL LAUGHING)
Cannibals?
We made our choice to go to sea, right, Aynsley, old pal?
And I swear, I'll not regret it.
Whoa!
(WHISPERS) All right.
Go and bring me something to eat!
Right, lovey.
I won't fail you.
(GROANING)
(CLUCKING)
Hey, which of you lucky clucks wants to join me for a little snack?
Here, chicky, chicky!
Come on, now, no need to be shy, my plump little... (AYNSLEY GROWLING)
What business might you be having above decks?
Oh, I was, uh, just making sure my chicken food...
(CHUCKLING NERVOUSLY) friends were... (GRUNTING) were fresh.
No, warm.
Warm and comfy.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- (BARKING)
Hold on!
Don't get your fur all in a knot.
So, then, where were we?
Knock it off!
You cats belong down below.
And stay away from our chickens!
- (YOWLING) - (GROANING)
(HISSING)
(AYNSLEY BARKING)
And that goes for you as well!
(GRUNTING)
Who does that green-gilled landlubber think he is?
Uh, the human who threw us into the hold?
This is our ship!
Wretched as it is, it's home!
Mark my word, Mal, someday, somehow, that canine and his human will pay!
(CHUCKLING) I'm with ya there, May.
They'll pay, all right.
Uh, how much exactly are we charging 'em?
(SIGHING)
That should teach them to mess with our egg supply, huh, old boy?
Eggs.
(GAGGING) Oh, no, not again.
(CHUCKLING) Buck up, boyo.
Ah, looks like we've got one doozy of a storm brewin'.
(THUNDER RUMBLING)
(WIND HOWLING)
(EXCLAIMS) So much for a peaceful meal.
- Whoa!
- Oh!
Oh, nobody saw that one coming!
- Whoa!
- Hang on, Carmello.
Perhaps it would be wise to move this soiree to the cave.
Let's get moving.
This is going to be a nasty one.
I'm with you on that call.
And Mak, grab the pineapple!
(GRUNTING)
Like we really needed this pineapple.
All hands on deck!
Get them sails down!
And secure the yardarms tight!
Get yourself below, mate!
Best you ride out the storm there!
Ah!
Oh!
(AYNSLEY WHIMPERING)
(WOOD CRACKING)
Ah!
Aynsley!
- (WHIMPERING) - l got you!
(SCREAMING) Oh!
Hey!
Hey!
(GRUNTING) Help!
Help!
(PANTING)
MAK:
Look out!
- Runaway pineapple!
- Whoa!
Oh!
(MUFFLED GROANING)
Sorry, Pango.
Careful, Scrubby!
- I got it!
Whoa...
- Scrubby!
Help!
Quick!
Rosie, the tree!
Easy, Scrubby, don't panic!
OK, I got ya now!
Well, come on, you old goat!
Get your hooves moving!
We ain't got all day!
That's it, easy.
Don't be afraid, one step at a time...
Whoa...
Scrubby!
- Help!
- He's not going to make it!
Do something!
Carmello, grab him.
CARMELLO:
I got...
- You!

H-H-H-Help!
(GRUNTING) Help!
We're in here!
Someone help!

No, no.
Ah!

- (GROWLING)
- Payback time!
(CHUCKLING)
I can't hold on, Mello!
This is the end, little buddy.
There's not much time!
They're gonna fall!
Hold steady!
I'm coming, mates!
- Pango, what are you doing?
- (PANGO SCREAMING)
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
Whoa!
How's it going, mate?
Nice try, Pango, but it's hopeless.
I'm a goner.
Mak!
Oh!
Hold on, hold on, hold on.
Oh.
Come on, come on, come on.
I'll get you guys out of there!
Ah!
We have to do something!
- Oops!
- Oh, no.
- Mak!
Look out!
- Ouch!
(GROANING)
- Mak!
- Oh...
This just went from bad to worse.
Don't worry, guys, that branch looks pretty solid to me.
Right, but how do we get down?
- You got me there.
- (nervous chuckle)
(ALL SCREAMING)
(SCREAMING CONTINUES)
(ALL GROANING)
- Oh, I can't believe it.
- (LAUGHING)
They're alive!
It's a miracle!
Hey. anybody want some pineapple?
(LAUGHING)
(AYNSLEY WHIMPERING)
(HOWLING)
(ROSIE SIGHING)
(ALL SNORING)
(LOUD RUMBLING)
Whoa, whoa!
Did you hear that sound?
- What's out there, Mak?
- I have no idea.
I've never heard a sound like that before.
(YAWNING) Can you see anything?
MAK:
Not a thing.
Unfortunately, we're going to have to wait until morning.
Same old stuff.
Shells and more shells.
Small ones, big ones...
That's a new taste.
Earthy, with a slight touch of salt.
(STRAINING) Come on.
Come to papa.
- (CLATTERING)
- Huh?
Hey, Scrubs, what did you find?
What is it you're eating?
I don't know but it's delicious.
Aw, Scrubs!
You know I collect stuff like this.
(SNIFFING)
My nose tells me there's more goodies up at Rocky Point.
(SNIFFING)
(GASPING) Look at that!
(STAMMERING) Woolly c-c-caterpillars!
See?
I was right.
This is the most incredible proof that there's another world out there!
ROSIE:
No.
Look behind you.
What are you talking about?
Behind me?
- Ah!
- (CLATTERING)
(GASPING) I can't believe it.
(GASPING) It's the thing we heard dying last night.
What do you think it is?
The other world.
I've got to get a closer look.
Mak, don't!
We have no idea what it is.
It's too dangerous, Mak!
But this is amazing!
I was right!
I knew it, I knew it.
I knew it!
This is from the other world!
I have never seen anything like this!
Incredible!
(LAUGHING)
Huh?
Ah!
(MUFFLED GROANING)
(SPITTING)
(GASPS)
(BANGING)
- Mak should be more careful.
- Pangy's right.
We should keep our distance.
(STAMMERING) What's going on?
- (BANGING CONTINUES)
- Easy now, whatever you are.
I just want to talk.
(EXCLAIMING)
Sea monsters.
- (BARKING) - (ALL SCREAMING)
Wow!
Look at this.
There's hardly any ship left, Aynsley.
- Hello!
- (SNIFFING)
Is anyone out there?
- Hey!
Can anyone hear me?
- (GASPING) Ooh.
Look at it.
CRUSOE:
Captain!
Bosun!
- Anyone?
- It's... hideous!
Where did they all go?
I can't believe everyone is really gone.
Looks like there's just the two of us.
Let's go to shore.
Hang on, Aynsley, the current's really strong.
(CRUSOE GRUNTING)
(ALL GASPING)
Uh-oh.
(LAUGHING)
Oh, land, sweet land!
Oh.
It's so good to be alive, Aynsley.
Bob's your uncle, sea monsters walking on land?
Uh-oh, we're in big trouble.
Only one thing has two legs.
A bird!
And that ain't no bird I've ever seen.
Yeah.
He can't even fly.
(SNIFFING)
(ALL GASPING)
(GASPING)
(BARKING)
(GASPS)
That monster is going to eat Carmello!
CRUSOE:
What's going on, Aynsley?
We gotta do something, now!
Hurry, make as much noise as you can.
We have to scare those sea monsters off!
Come back here, Aynsley!
- Stay close together.
- (BARKING CONTINUES)
We don't know what's out there.
- (CLANKING)
- What was that?
Aynsley!
Aynsley, what's that noise?
Ah!
Cannibals, Aynsley, Cannibals!
We have to get off this island!
The sailor warned us.
(WHIMPERING)
They'll skin us alive and eat us!
Hurry, old boy.
They're coming for us!
Uh, get inside the barrel.
Go, boy, go.
There.
Yes.
Guys, guys, guys.
What are you doing?
Scaring off the sea monsters, thank you very much.
And what if they aren't sea monsters?
Did you see the furry one's teeth?
He'll rip us to shreds!
Everybody calm down!
We're safe here.
Are we?
We really don't know what those creatures are capable of!
I know one thing they're capable of, leaving the island!
What?
Oh, no!
Come on, this can't be happening to me.
He's actually leaving.
We did it!
We got rid of him.
Yeah, we scared them big time!
Will somebody tell me what's happening?
I'll tell you what's going on.
You guys have ruined my chance to get off this island and see the world.
You really don't get it, do you?
You think this paradise.
Well, it is not!
It meant so much to me.
(GRUNTING)
- He's back.
- Oh, no, here we go again.
Back?
Are you serious?
Let me see!
Here's what we're going to do.
We stay out of sight and we keep an eye on them, see what they plan on doing.
OK?
OK, then.
Nobody goes on the beach.
That goes for you, too, Scrubby.
Yeah, yeah.
I heard ya.
Didn't even get to finish my breakfast.
(ALL SNORING)
(SNIFFING)
All those new smells are driving me crazy!
I gotta go check it out.
ROSIE: (WHISPERING) Where you going, Scrubby?
Psst!
Come back.
It's not safe out there.
Can't let all those tasty morsels get washed away.
If I recall correctly, didn't Mak say we should all stay out of sight?
He did!
Speaking of which, where is Mak?
Sorry about today, old friend.
That was a pretty inept attempt.
Oh, what was I thinking?
I haven't the foggiest idea where we are, nor, for that matter, the slightest inkling in which direction to set sail.
Someone's bound to come and save us, old boy.
- (WHIMPERING)
- I'm sure of it.
If those cannibals come back, we'll be ready for them.
(SNORING)
- (OBJECTS CLATTERING) - (GASPING)
Who's out there?
Show yourselves!
My dog'll tear you to shreds!
And I have a musket!
- (SCRUBBY BLEATING)
- Huh?
A goat?
(CHUCKLING) It's just a goat.
(CLATTERS)
- (CAWS)
- And a bird.
Maybe there aren't any cannibals after all.
Mak, what were you doing out there all by yourself?
I thought you said we should stay hidden?
I was just checking things out is all.
What's all the commotion about, anyway?
Well, Epi just made a good point.
I just suggested, hypothetically, that possibly the sea monster lost that thingamajig you found.
And maybe he's come to get it back!
Along with us!
It's one of two things for sure, a coincidence or a bad omen.
Either way, you need to get rid of it.
Why not just give it back to the sea monsters?
Peachy idea.
No way!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa...
- You're kidding?
You're so selfish!
Selfish?
OK.
Uh, maybe.
Just give me time to think about it.
But if I do give it back, you're all coming with me.
(ALL GROANING)
(SIGHS)
Well.
All right, then, Aynsley, we've got some work to do.
Let's save whatever we can before it is all lost to the sea.
(WHIMPERING)
(GRUNTS)
- (SCRUBBY SNORING)
- How's it looking, mate?
They're taking over our beach.
He's pulling strange stuff out from the sea.
I suppose this means they're not leaving any time soon, then?
Looks that way.
(GRUNTING)
(SNORING)
(YAWNING)
Do you see how the four-legged one sleeps all day while the big one does the work?
No, but I'll take your word for it.
I'll bet ya the sleeping one's the boss.
(STRAINING)
(PANTING)
(GASPING) Look, he stripped off his skin!
Ugh, I'm going to be sick.
TUESDAY:
None of us knew it at the time, but we were being watched by the real monsters on the island.
(INSECT BUZZING)
Some luck, huh, May?
That green-gilled human and his mangy mutt made it safely here.
How are we gonna deal with him?
He might be a problem for us.
Don't you worry.
I'll figure out a way to get rid of them quick enough.
For the time being, we sit, watch and wait.
Aw, come on, May, I'm starving here.
And what did I just say?
(CHOKING) Sit.
Watch.
Wait.
That's right.
Now, stay focused!
We've got the upper claw.
No one knows we're here.
Which means we take our time and we pick them off one by one.
(LAUGHING)
(GRUNTING)
Ah, look, Aynsley!
These could come in very handy.
I'd better practice a bit before we venture out there to get our dinner, right, boy?

- Shh.
Pull back the hammer and...
- (GUNSHOT) - (ALL GASPING)
I don't know about you, Scrubby, but I plan on staying as far away from that monster as possible.
- (PANTING)
- What was that all about?
- I have absolutely no idea.
- (GUNSHOT)
But what we need to find out is what these newcomer's intentions are.
From the sound of it, they're up to no good.
Obviously they're trying to kill us.
Maybe.
But maybe not.
The truth of the matter is that these newcomers have brought nothing but trouble to our paradise.
That is a fact.
Fine.
Then do like I asked and stay out of sight.
They're proof that there's another world out there and I'm going to find out whether they're friend or foe.
You really don't get it, do you?
(GUNSHOT)
- (GUNSHOT)
- Whoa!
That was close.
OK, let's give this a go one last time.
Ah!
Did you see that, Aynsley?
I did it!
I hit the mark!
(SIGHS)
Let's go fix something to eat, old boy.
(CHUCKLING) That was a miracle, I never thought I'd hit it!
Well, maybe we'll eat something after all.
TUESDAY:
I was starting to wonder if everyone wasn't right.
The new world was finally here and I had no idea if I was ready for it or not.
(HUMMING)
(SLURPS) Mmm...
That's the biggest rat I've ever seen.
Go for the throat, let's make this quick.
Wait, the human!
(ROSIE GRUNTING)
Oh, I can't do it, boy.
Go on!
Shoo!
Go!
What now?
Sorry, pal, I've never shot anything before.
What say we try fishing?
(SNIFFING) What's burning?
U-(HISSING)
That would be me.
You smell like burnt biscuits.
Shh!
Something's coming.
Looks like Rosie was here.
That's strange, Rosie never leaves any food behind.
- (YOWLING)
- Oh!
Oh, no.
(SCREAMING)
Would you prefer white or dark meat for brunch, darling?
I prefer...
Dog!
Time to get even, ratter!
(GROWLING)
CRUSOE:
Hold on, Aynsley!
I'm coming!
Those blasted ratters, they did survive after all!
Ah, I'm hit!
Run for it!
(SIGHS)
- Good dog.
- (WHIMPERING)
You all right, old boy?
(SQUAWKS)
Did you hear that?
Over there.
Oh, look, it's a bird, a beautiful parrot.
- (GROANING)
- So, Aynsley, that's what all the fuss was about.
Those ratters were after the bird.
You've done good, old boy.
And you...
We're going to fix you up straight away.
Look, Aynsley, a ring!
That can only mean one thing.
Sailors have set foot on this island before.
I believe there's hope for us after all.
You can come out guys, there's no one around.
SCRUBBY:
It's too dark, I can't see a thing.
This is the very spot where that sea monster attacked me.
Well, sort of.
Oh, are muse...
We shouldn't have let him go alone.
Maybe he's moulting.
Oh, that's a bit of a stretch, Pango.
Just wait till I get my hooves on them.
Any way you look at it, this is not good.
Mak can't be gone.
- (MAL CHUCKLING)
- What's that?
And who are you two?
Just two homeless castaways.
We were held captive by that human for months with nothing to eat but the crumbs from his table.
What about our friend?
Did you see him, by any chance?
Oh, 'tis a true tragedy, all right.
Oh, an unfortunate turn of events.
You see, we caused... (GROANS)
(CHUCKLING NERVOUSLY) We saw the whole thing.
Well, come on, let's hear it.
What are you waiting for?
We'll tell you what happened to your friend but I'm warning ya, it ain't pretty.
You see, the human loves to eat birds and I am afraid your friend got...
Trapped.
Mmm-hmm.
(SQUAWKING)
This should only take a minute.
It's just dislocated.
But it's going to hurt a bit... (SQUAWKING)
Don't worry, you'll feel better in a day or two, though you won't be able to fly right away.
Well, then,
I suppose you'll need a name if you're going to stay here for a while.
Let's see.
By my reckoning, today's Tuesday.
That's as good a name as any, eh?
Can you say Tuesday?
Tuesday?
(SQUAWKING)
(LAUGHING)
Well, not quit.
But that's a start.
Take care of our new friend, boy.
I'd better offload as much stuff as I can.
No telling how long the ship will stay in one piece.
- (GROWLS SOFTLY) - (GULPS)
(SQUAWKING)
They're nothing but cannibals!
Murderers!
I say we run 'em off our island!
Drive them monsters back into the sea!
Perhaps a plan might be to force them to live on Curse Island!
Yeah!
Oh, yes, yes, yes!
(LAUGHING)
Curse Island!
Uh, what exactly is Curse Island?
Ooh!
The end of the earth, mate.
No one's ever made it back from there.
Yeah.
There's nothing there but bugs.
Lots and lots of nasty bugs.
Sounds perfect.
Drive them to Curse Island.
That's not going to work.
You have a better idea?
Uh, no.
Right.
So, then, where were we?
(SQUAWKING)
Stop your flapping about, bird.
You need to be resting that wing of yours.
(PANTING) What do you want from me?
I just want to talk.
The name's Aynsley, and from what I understand, yours is Tuesday.
Call me whatever you want, except dinner.
Dinner?
We're not going to eat you.
We saved your life!
Either way, you'll not make much of a meal.
Not like the fat, juicy turkeys we have back home.
- (SQUAWKING)
- Relax, my master likes you.
You said your master?
You did not think that I... (LAUGHING)
Oh, I like you.
You're funny.
I've never seen a bird like you in England.
Eng-land.
Tell me more, Aynsley.
Aye, laddie.
England, my island, just one fantastic place in a sea of many lands.
I knew it!
Crusoe wants to explore them all.
If we ever get off this one.
You know, you're the first to come from the outside world.
Oh, dear, that's not good news.
(CARMELLO BLOWING)
Uh, hold on a second.
We're made up like this because...
Because you look fierce.
Now, get your heads in the game, everyone!
(SOFTLY) We have the perfect opportunity.
The dog and that bird are still on the ship.
Right.
Listen up!
Here's the plan.
We'll deal with the hairy beast on the ship.
The rest of you go for the human on the beach.
What's a ship?
That wooden thing on the beach.
(SIGHS)
As soon as we're on the ship, the wooden thing, you attack!
Right, then.
Fierce, fierce, fierce.
So, I'm a fierce coconut?
(CHUCKLING)
I should go tell my friends that I'm OK.
You'd better stay put, you're in no condition to fly.
Well, look at this.
We can kill two birds with one stone.
Hmm?
There's two birds now?
Oh, shut it!
Just follow my lead.
Look, look!
That tail feather.
He's wearing Mak like a trophy!
That is so wrong!
Attack!
Let's get him!
(SCREAMING)
(SCREECHING)
Whoa...
- (BRAYING)
- Yee-haw!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Aysnley, we'd better go.
What's going on out there?
They've all gone mad.
- Ah!
- It appears as if your friends
- have come to avenge your death.
- I'm not dead.
Oh, we're going to take care of that right now!
Aynsley!
Help!
AYNSLEY:
I have had it with you!
- (GROWLING) - (MEOWING)
- Ah!
- (HISSING)
(MAL GROANING)
Aynsley!
(SCREAMS)
Whoa...
(SHRIEKS)
(AYNSLEY GROWLING)
Come on down, then!
Get off me!
Aynsley!
(GROWLING)
(GRUNTS)
(COUGHING)
Tuesday?
(SQUAWKING)
(AYNSLEY HOWLING)
- Hold on!
That sounded like...
- Mak!
Aynsley!
Mak, get out!
Kiki!
(SCREAMS)
Mak.
I'm coming, boy!
(GROANS)
Rotten cats!
You're to blame for all this!
- (STRAINING)
- AYNSLEY:
You must leave the ship now.
Go!
- Aynsley!
- Go!
(SCREAMING)
(ALL EXCLAIMING)
What's happening here?
I thought Mak was dead.
We all did, but I don't think he made it this time.
That would be horrible!
Come on, guys, we'd better move back now.
Oh, no!
Aynsley.
What have I done'?
(PANTING)
- (HICCUPS) Land.
- (GROANS)
Land!
We're saved, May!
I thought we were goners.
Oh, will you just shut up?
- (INSECTS BUZZING)
- What's that noise?
- That would be bugs.
- Bugs!
- Curse Island!
- (MAY SCREAMING)
Rest in peace, old boy.
(SIGHS)
(SQUAWKS)
Tuesday!
(SQUAWKS)
Psst!
(WHISPERING) Mak!
Kiki!
- Mak, you're hurt.
- I'll be OK.
I'm sure glad to see you.
- I was worried!
- Me, too.
Come on, now's your chance to get away.
- I can't.
- Let me help you.
No, no...
I...
I just...
I don't want to get away.
What?
You don't understand.
It's all those cats' fault.
- What do you mean?
- They attacked me.
He fixed my wing.
And his dog gave his life to save me.
I can't leave him now.
Oh, I see.
So, he's going to take care of you?
Look, he's going to need my help to survive.
I owe him that.
Exactly how do you plan on doing that?
I mean, look at him!
- (GRUNTING) - (CLATTERING)
(SIGHS)
(GROANING) Tuesday, help!
(CHUCKLING)
I don't believe it.
Those cats used us and Mak as well and what do we do?
We attack the human.
Hold on, then.
So what you're saying is Kiki's to blame for all this?
- Oh, afraid so!
- That's not fair.
We all thought Mak was dead.
Didn't we?
Oh, this is not good, mates.
Yeah.
We've made a real mess of things.
Ah, it looks that way, Epi, gal.
Where you going, Rosie?
ROSIE:
Off to clean up our mess!
I'm in.
Well, let's get cracking then, mates!
Wait a second!
(SIGHS) You're going to make an even bigger mess of things.
(GASPS) The wild beasts!
They're going to get us!
(SQUAWKING)
Stay right where you are.
(ALL GASPING)
I've got a special treat for all of you.
Oh.
(SCRUBBY BLEATING)
I just want to give you some biscuits is all.
They're quite good.
I finished off your dog, human, and I promise, one day, you and the rest of your lot will join him.
(GAGS)
Now, that is the taste of desperation.
Try the red ones.
They taste just like chicken.
Mmm!
(YAWNING)
(YAWNING)
What...
What?
Do you want to show me something?
All right.
All right, let's go.
(GRUNTING)
Oh, Tuesday, this is fantastic!
Fresh water!
Good job, Tuesday.
(SQUAWKING)
What?
You want me to follow you?
OK, I'm coming.
Hey, guys, look who's here.
(ALL SCREAMING)
Relax, there's nothing to be afraid of.
Stay right where you are.
I'll be right back.
What got into him?
- Why is he running away?
- Beats me.
- Maybe it's your smell.
- Huh?
(CHUCKLING)
Try one of these, it's really good.
And some for you.
Enjoy!
(SNIFFING)
- (BLEATING) - (GRUNTS)
Say, Tuesday, where is pretty bird?
I haven't seen her yet.
Pretty bird!
(SQUAWKS)
No need to yell, Mak, I mean, Tuesday.
I'm right here.
There you are, pretty bird.
Here, you see?
I won't hurt you.
Come on, don't be afraid.
Come on, pretty bird.
Ouch!
(CHUCKLES)
(SCRUBBY BLEATING)
Well, friendships aren't made in a day.
We'll take it one step at a time, right, Tuesday?
(SQUAWS) One step.
(INSECTS BUZZING)
(MEOWING)
I can't, May.
The current's too strong.
- So you failed again, did you?
- Oh... (WAILING)
Oh, stop feeling sorry for yourself.
Our time will come.
Soon there will be more of us.
Revenge will be sweet.
Oh!
(MEOWING)
(CLATTERING)
Ah!
- (CLANGING) - (SCRUBBY GRUNTING)
(GROANING)
Oh!
That hurt.
Why, you can't see a bloody thing, can you, you old goat?
We're going to have to fix that.
There you are.
That should help.
(EXCLAIMS)
(LAUGHING)
Whoo-hoo!
Why, Rosie, you're no pig.
Hey!
What's gotten into you?
You're gorgeous!
Easy. big boy.
Whoo!
Oh!
Ow!
Oh.
Oh, no!
Whoa!
No, no, no, no, no!
No, no.
Ah!
Oh!
No.
Oh, no!
- Tuesday, help!
- (SQUAWKING)
(GRUNTING) Hey. guys!
(SNORTING)
(SQUAWKING)
Oh, never mind.
This is hopeless.
(SIGHING)
How am I ever going to survive on this island?
(SIGHING)
(LAUGHS)
Yes, of course, that's it!
I have to build a treehouse.
Ha-ha!
(SAWING)
(SHRIEKS)
It's raining tree limbs.
Ooh.
Hmm, tastes good enough to eat.
Is there anything you wouldn't eat?
Hey, Pango.
What's he doing?
Don't know, mate.
This cobber's gone b-b-bonkers on us.
He's destroying the tree!
(MUTTERING) Must keep sawing...
Need to finish shelter.
- Must build...
- (INSECTS BUZZING)
Mmm.
Ah!
Yes, sir.
More porridge, please.
(SNORING)
TUESDAY:
We had no clue what Crusoe was up to.
Sawing?
Porridge?
Yep, as Pango would say, he was bonkers to the max.
How are you coming along, May?
- (KITTENS MEWING)
- Can I have just a little a peek'?
Can you just wait?
I'm cleaning them up.
Well, could you at least tell me how big a litter we have?
More than we'll ever be able to feed, I'm afraid.
(MEWING)
- Oh, look at it...
- (HISSING)
Hey!
(MEOWING)
(KITTENS MEWING)
(SQUAWKS)
ow!
That smarts.
I'm trying to work here.
Go eat somewhere else.
At this rate, I'll never get this built.
I told you, go!
Ah, never mind.
What I wouldn't give for an extra set of hands.
TUESDAY:
For all his pounding and sawing, we couldn't figure out what he was actually doing.
Whoa!
Now what is going on?
Argh, really?
TUESDAY:
I couldn't blame Rosie.
When you've got an itch, you've gotta scratch it!
But poor Crusoe, he didn't see it that way.
He had had enough.
And that's when it hit me!
A nest!
- Mmm-mmm.
- Hey, guys!
I figured out what he's doing.
Uh, making a mess?
No.
He's building a shelter!
Huh?
Don't follow ya, mate.
He's building a nest!
- A nest?
- So he is a bird.
Scrubs.
He's building a human nest in the tree!
Oh!
Pretty clever!
- I've never slept in a tree.
- (CHUCKLES)
If he stocks it with food, you'll sleep in a tree.
Good point!
So, guys, I got an idea.
What do ya say we help him out, get this nest of his built?
I must have been crazy thinking I could build this all by my... self.
TUESDAY:
We didn't really have any idea what we were getting into.
We just figured let's help, use whatever abilities we had and hoped it all worked.
Well, I'll be gobsmacked!
(ROSIE GRUNTING)
Slowly, slowly.
(SQUAWKS) Slowly, slowly.
That's it, just a little more.
- (GRUNTING) - (EPI HUMMING)
Hi, Epi!
Where are you headed with all that food?
Whoa!
I need a little help here, guys!
- Easy.
- Hmm, salty.
Not that kind of help.
No, no.
That tickles!
Epi, hold up.
I'm starving!
Whoa!
Help!
TUESDAY:
Things didn't always go smoothly.
And we had our ups and downs, that's for sure.
But everyone was in fine spirits.
And Crusoe seemed, well, happy.
He made a funny little door for Epi and Pango to get into the nest.
It was a pretty good idea.
After a few modifications, that is.
(CHUCKLING)
We became a real team, playing all these funny games Crusoe came up with.
He had all sorts of crazy ideas.
- Oh!
Like hiding seeds in the ground.
- (T H U M Pl N G)
(BAGPIPES PLAYING)
Crusoe had a funny way of eating.
He peeled the fruit.
(CHUCKLING) And boy, did he eat slow.
Ah!
(SNORTING)
It took quite a while, but despite his awkwardness and all of his flaws,
Crusoe surprised even the most sceptical among us.
That's it, that's it.
Watch your step.
I just put the finishing touches on our new home.
(SQUAWKS) New home.
Hold it right there.
First thing we must do is christen the place.
It's good luck, you know.
I christen thee...
Oh!
(LAUGHING) Oh, never mind.
Three cheers for us.
Wow!
Now, look at that.
(GASPS) It's so beautiful!
Hip, hip, hooray!
(PLAYING BAGPIPES)
What in the world is that noise he's making?
- Sounds like Scrubby when he needs food!
- Hmm!
It's painful, mates.
Let's get outta here.
Oh!
Personally, I think it sounds beautiful.
(SIGHING)
A party and we weren't invited.
MAY:
Mal!
Quit your daydreaming.
I am starving here!
Oh, coming.
(KITTENS MEOWING)
You know how difficult it is in my condition to hunt right now.
Have you tried to make it to the other island lately?
Oh, May.
You know the last time I tried I almost drowned.
I'm afraid we're stuck with just the bugs and spiders.
They sound delicious.
Now, go and hunt some up for me.
Right, darling.
I'll wrap 'em in seaweed just the way you like 'em.
TUESDAY:
With the nest completed, Crusoe moved on to a new project.
We didn't have to forage for food, we had this great nest.
And we even had indoor plumbing!
Paradise just got better.
(SIGHING)
That human sure has made life peachy for us.
Rosie, he's bonzer to the max.
I tell ya, old girl, if this new world Mak talks about is this cushy, it may not be that bad after all.
Getting a little plump, aren't we?
Sitting around all day.
Ain't nothing wrong with a few curves, Kiki, honey.
(WHISTLING)
With Crusoe doing the fishing, we'll be putting some curves on you too in no time, Kiki.
Ooh, what do we have here?
Hmm.
Looks like Crusoe is going to put your fishing skills to shame, Kiki.
(HUFFS)
TUESDAY:
As time passed, life became more and more comfortable for us all.
Yet Crusoe seemed very sad at times.
He missed his old world.
He built a strange tower an the highest point of the island, with bright lights burning every night.
Another day, no ships in sight, little fella.
What I wouldn't give to see the sun set over the Thames.
Thames?
(YAWNING)
Come on, partner.
I don't get it.
Why does he light this every night?
In the hope that some other humans will pass by.
If they see the signal, they'll come and rescue him.
TUESDAY:
I knew the chances of leaving this island were becoming slimmer as time went by.
I just didn't know how slim.
More humans on our island?
(SCOFFS) That's not going to happen.
(THUNDER RUMBLING)
(CLEARING THROAT)
And now, my friends, like all good Englishmen, a moment of silence to give thanks for this bountiful harvest.
Psst!
Mind your manners.
- Our host is...
- Taking a snooze, it appears.
(CHUCKLING) Or worse.
(FLY BUZZING)
Psst!
Hey, stop fooling around.
- (THUNDER CRACKLING) - (WIND HOWLING)
At least we're not out in that weather.
Oh, it's miserable out there.
Listen to you guys!
We're meant to live in the weather.
(SCOFFS) Have you all gone soft?
Whoa, whoa, Kiki.
Why get so worked up?
Oh, you haven't seen worked up.
Answer me this.
What happens to us when Crusoe leaves this island?
I mean, have you thought of that?
Kiki, now...
Now, listen.
Oh, I'm listening.
I'm listening loud and clear, Mak!
Shall we eat'?
(WIND WHISTLING)
(GROANING) If I could just find one little morsel.
One measly little morsel.
(GASPS) It's mine!
It's all mine!
Mine, mine, mine, mine!
(LAUGHING)
(CATS MEOWING)
(HISSING)
- What's yours?
- Nothing.
You wouldn't be depriving your family, now, would you, sweetheart?
Yes.
I mean no.
(GROWLS)
Oh!
Oh, May, that hurts.
- Shame on you!
I should...
- (THUNDER RUMBLING)
Look, the ship's falling apart.
Our luck is turning.
Maybe we'll be able to make it back to the main island after all.
Hey, what do you say we go outside and have some fun on the waterslide?
Great idea!
I love all the smells after a good rain.
I'll catch up with you guys later.
I'd better find Kiki first, make sure she's all right.
Why didn't that ship just vanish into the sea?
Our lives are never going to be the same again.
(YELLS)
(SCREAMING)
Shall we have a little snack before we move on to the main island?
Oh!
(GASPS)
- (SNARLING)
- Help!
Scream all you want, little bird.
No one's going to save you now.
(MIMICKING CRUSOE) I'll be the son of a sea cook!
Watch out, children, it's the human!
Get your filthy paws off my bird!
Epi, Pango, to the left.
We'd better get out of here, quick!
Come on, everyone, we've got them surrounded!
Attack!
Ka-boom!
Oh, he got me.
(GROANING)
- (SQUAWKING) - (SNARLING)
If this is heaven, why are you here?
They're heading for the big island!
They're everywhere!
It's all my fault!
We have to warn the others!
Get to the nest!
Now, hurry!
(SQUAWKING)
- (SQUAWKS) Predators!
- What?
- Did he say predators?
- (GASPING)
(SCREAMS)
Oh, no!
Hang on, everyone, I'll get my musket.
(GRUNTING)
(ROSIE SCREAMING)
Oh!
- Batten down the hatches!
- (TUESDAY SQUAWKS)
TUESDAY:
Batten down the hatches!
I just need a little powder and then some shot.
That's it, Tuesday, close everything up.
Ow!
Ah!
They're everywhere!
Get off of me!
Ah!
Ah!
(SCREAMING)
- (SQUAWKING) - (SNARLING)
Stay away, you bloody ratters!
(GRUNTING)
(LOW GROWLING)
(SQUAWKS)
Tuesday, ah!
- Help!
- (GASPS)
Get me down from here!
I may not know human but that's "help" in any language.
Carmello!
Crusoe needs our help.
Oh!
Ah!
- (SNARLING)
- Uh-oh!
(MEOWING)
Oh, duck!
Ooh!
Hurry, Epi!
(ALL SCREAMING)
- (SCREAMING)
- Whoa!
Whoa!
Oh!
Yee-haa!
Uh-oh.
(GRUNTING)
Pango!
Over here!
Jump!
- Stand back, Epi!
- Ooh!
Hurry!
He's right behind you!
(MEOWING)
Yee-haa!
Go. go!
(GRUNTING)
I need my musket.
(ROSIE SQUEALING)
(CRUSOE SCREAMING)
Now look what you've done!
You guys stay put!
(GRUNTING)
Oh, not again!
Stay away, you mangy cat!
Hang on, Crusoe!
(GRUNTING)
(YELPS)
Good job, buddy.
(SCREAMS)
(GASPING)
(SCREAMING)
Huh?
(CHUCKLING) That wasn't so bad.
Keep pushing.
I'll take care of these blighters!
(MEOWING)
Whoa!
Whoa!
Pango!
(YELLS) Help!
Whoa!
That's awful high.
Come on, you can make it.
Jump!
Oh, my.
Here goes.
Ooh!
(GRUNTING)
- Oh, dear.
- Good work!
Now, let's get out of here.
OK.
So long, furball!
(YELPS)
(LAUGHING)
Hungry, are we?
Well, then, take that!
And how about a banana?
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
So long, Knucklehead!
- (MEOWS) - (SPLASHING)
(GRUNTING)
Scrubby, the door!
(SHRIEKING)
- (GROWLING) - (GRUNTING)
Come on!
(ROSIE YELLING)
My turn!
(MEOWS)
Hello there.
(CAT SCREAMING)
Many thanks, Scrubs.
(PANGO AND EPI SCREAMING)
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Over here, Epi, girl!
Get in the bucket!
Going up!
(LAUGHING)
Pango, get him off!
- (EPI GRUNTS) - (PANGO SCREAMS)
Get off, you mangy cat!
(SCREAMING)
Good work, Epi!
(LAUGHING)
- They'll never get me.
- (BOTH LAUGHING)
- We got rid of 'em, didn't we?
- (SNARLING)
- Epi!
- (EPI SCREAMING)
Pango!
- (EPI SCREAMING)
- Huh?
Whoa!
Help me.
Look out behind you, Epi!
(YELLING)
(ALL SCREAMING)
EPI:
Whoa!
Whoa!
- Help!
- No!
Epi!
Hang on, I'm coming!
- Whoa!
- (EPI SCREAMING)
Let go of me!
(PANTING)
(SCREAMS)
(SCREAMS)
(GRUNTING)
The cats are trying to get in through the hatch!
No!
Rosie, no, that was Crusoe.
- Oops!
- Help me get this open.
Oh, I hope you didn't hurt him.
Oh!
Everybody OK?
Everybody except Crusoe.
TUESDAY:
Come on guys, all together.
It's heavy.
CARMELLO:
Spread out, Rosie.
We need all the muscle we can muster!
ROSIE:
Really?
OK, OK.
One, two, three!
Well, that's a bit of a bummer, mates.
We need Crusoe!
How's he doing, Kiki?
He's alive but he won't be of any use to us.
We're going to need a miracle to hold all these cats back.
- (CATS MEOWING)
- I got it.
The musket!
Watch out, guys, it's going to be noisy!
Are you sure that's a good idea?
It's worth a try.
What else can we do?
(CATS POUNDING AND MEOWING)
Uh-huh.
This could be a bit more complicated than I thought.
MAY:
Hmm, the human's out.
Time to make our move.
Hurry!
We can't hold them off much longer.
He always pulls that thingamajig back first!
OK, get ready.
Huh?
That's weird.
Hmm.
What's happening in there?
- (CATS SNARLING) - (GRUNTING)
Hey, Tuesday, maybe this thingy has something to do with it.
What thingy?
(ALL MEOWING)
(GRUNTING)
(SQUAWKS)
- (GUNSHOT)
- Ah!
(CATS SCREECHING)
(TUESDAY GROANING)
(COUGHING)
Now what?
You know they're going to come back!
Maybe Crusoe will come to and save us.
I hate to break it to you guys.
We're on our own.
We have to get out of here, hide someplace.
What about Crusoe?
Pango's right!
We can't leave him here.
Guys, guys, it may not be perfect, but I think I've got a plan.
Well, you'd better lay it out, cos we're out of time.
All right, children, calm down.
They just got lucky this time.
We're going to sneak up on them and make them pay.
Now let's show them what we're made of!
(GROANING)
Oh. yeah!
(STRAINING)
(SQUAWKS)
Aw, you've got a broken wing, have you?
Don't worry.
We'll put you out of my misery.
Stay back or I'll shoot!
Not so brave now, are you?
Uh-oh!
(CHUCKLING)
Appears your luck has just run out.
Oh!
(SQUAWKS)
Whoa!
You'll have to be quicker than that, ratter!
Get him!
He can't fly!
That should take care of you quite nicely.
Sweet dreams from your favourite ratter.
- (SQUAWKING)
- Get ready!
- We got him cornered, May.
- Then, let's finish him off once and for all.
Catch me if you can, ratter!
(CATS MEOWING)
Whoa!
Hold on!
Rosie, stop!
We have to wait for the signal.
(SQUAWKS)
This is it, give it all you have, Rosie!
(STRAINING)
- Huh?
What's going on?
- They tricked us.
Hold on to that tail, I'll take care of him.
We're not so cocky any more, are we?
(SQUAWKING)
- (SQUAWKING)
- Tuesday's in trouble!
Ah!
(SCREAMING)
Oh, ho!
That was a bonzer plan you had there, mate.
Couldn't have done it without you guys.
Huh?
The fire!
Crusoe!
Crusoe!
(GRUNTING)
Over here.
(GRUNTS)
(SQUAWKING)
(SCREAMING)
Ouch, that must have really hurt!
We pulled Crusoe out to safety, unconscious but alive.
And then, out of the blue, we get cannon-blasted from your ship.
Aye.
The Captain can be one tough bloke.
What do you expect?
They're pirates, after all.
Pirates?
(CHUCKLING) You know, like them nasty ratters, only worse.
I had a pack of crazed cats on my right.
I was sure I was a goner!
I took my musket in one hand, my sword in the other and carved a swath to the savage hordes.
Whoa!
(CHUCKLING)
It was horrible, Captain!
That is the most fantastical yarn I've heard in all me life!
'Tis no yarn, Captain.
Mmm.
So you say.
Well, then, 'tis time to set sail.
You and your bird can take a bunk below.
Oh, Captain.
I cannot tell you how I long to see England again.
- England?
- (PIRATES LAUGHING)
We'll not be sailing for them ports.
Lest we want to be hanging from the gallows.
- (PIRATES CONTINUE LAUGHING)
- Right, me mates?
But you see...
We...
I must...
Can you at least drop me off a bit closer to home?
You're with us now.
Once a pirate, always a pirate.
Have you got a problem with that?
- But Captain, if I might...
- Enough talk!
Off with ya!
And I'll be expectin' ya to carry your weight, lad.
Or you'll be walkin' the plank, ye will,
OI' worse.
(MEOWING)
Look!
ls it a mirage, May?
MAY:
It's not a mirage, you idiot!
It's a ship!
Children, start paddling!
♪ I ply my trade for the Union Jack

(LAUGHING)
Hey, give it here!
That be my rum ye be drinkin'!
Oh, you want some rum, do ya?
How's me fists instead?
These are some nasty pirates.
It won't end well, I'm afraid, if we stay another moment.
Hey!
What you be fixin' to do there?
Oh, nothing.
Nothing at all.
Is that right?
That ingrate we done rescued from the island is trying to steal one of our rowboats!
If anybody gonna be stealing anything, it be us!
No, I was just...
Hey!
What's going on out here?
Bosun, he's trying to jump ship.
Get him and throw him in the brig.
Right!
Let's teach him a lesson.
Take that!
(PIRATES CLAMOURING)
(GRUNTS)
(GASPS)
Go get him!
Hey, he's gettin' away!
Grab him!
Ha, give me a piece of him!
(PIRATES LAUGHING)
There's no way off this ship, you fool!
Ah!
Whoa!
Whoa!
- Get him!
- Tuesday!
- He's mine!
- I'll grab him.
Whoa!
A raft!
(LAUGHING)
You fools couldn't hit the broadside of a barn!
Come on, lads, show me what ye be made of.
(TUESDAY MIMICKING LONG JOHN SILVER) Bosun!
Get your scurvy excuse for a pirate down to my cabin!
Now!
Aye, aye, Cap'n.
Right away!
TUESDAY:
And the rest of you fools, back to work before I give you each ten lashes of me whip!
- Blasted bird.
- (SQUAWKING)
Cap'n, he's getting away!
- Shall we send some men after him?
- Nay.
Let him go.
Oh, Captain!
Can't we fire a cannon shot, blow him to smithereens'?
Why waste a good cannonball?
Let him spend the rest of his life on that long-forgotten island.
(LAUGHING) That is, if the wild beasts don't devour him first.
(LAUGHING)
Aye, aye, Captain!
(SNIFFING)
It's been nice knowing ya, Ruf.
We did have ourselves a good run there, didn't we, Cec?
(SQUAWKING)
Jump!
(MEOWING)
(LAUGHING) I wasn't going to let those ratters get you.
We friends gotta stick together.
Nice of you to think so.

I haven't had me breakfast yet, either.

Signal fire!
Starboard bow!

Cap'n?
Cap'n, wake up!
You wakey, wakey!
Ah!
Attack!
Board the ship.
Take no prisoners.
(MUMBLING) Oh.
Oh, Bosun, it's you!
Yeah.
Sorry to be wake you, Cap'n, but there's a signal fire on a small, uncharted island off the starboard side.
What course of action shall we be taking?
Let me have a look.
Hmm.
Some sort of house on fire.
What's this?
Fire a broadside, drive those bloody beasts off!
Aye, aye, Cap'n.
Then go and bring back whoever he is.
And Bosun, make sure they leave nothing behind of any value.
Will do, Cap'n.
(LAUGHING)
Oh... (BOTH LAUGHING)
(GASPS) Humans?
What's yer go-by, fellow?
Crusoe...
Robinson Crusoe.
Oh, looks like them wild beasts nearly had ya for dinner!
- Lucky we found ya when we did.
- (BOTTLE CLATTERING)
No, they are my...

Let's have a look in there.

Aw!
Not a single gold tooth in his head.

(BOTH LAUGHING)
LONG JOHN SILVER:
You be one lucky bloke.
Crusoe, is it?
CRUSOE:
I'm in your debt, Captain.
Nay, 'twas me eagle-eyed night watch who done saved your hide.
(PARROT SQUAWKING)
Away with ya, you blasted bird!
No, Captain, he's with me.
No, Captain, he's with me!
(LAUGHING)
A talking parrot?
What skulduggery is this?
Taught him to talk yourself, did ya?
- Yes, Captain.
- (LIQUID POURING)
Drink up!
That'll stir your stumps, mate.
Now, tell me more about this island of yourn.
Is there anything of, shall we say, value on it?
(COUGHING)
All I can say is that I was shipwrecked, marooned, fending for myself with nothing but time and very few skills to survive.
(GAGGING)
Sorry about that.
I see the bird has taught you how to drink as well. (LAUGHING)
That's not very polite, Tuesday.
You'll have to wait outside, I'm afraid.
Fending for myself?
Really?
(SNIFFING)
Listen, you two want to hear the true tale of Robinson Crusoe?
Oh!
Oh, sure.
We're all ears, or at least Cecil here is. (LAUGHING)
Hey, come on, Ruf.
It all began like every other day before Crusoe came to my island.
Just another day in paradise.
Every day was the same.
Beautiful turquoise water, blue skies and lots of delicious fruit.
Mmm.
Sounds perfect, right?
Boring if you ask me.
How much paradise can a bird take?
I really wanted to get off this island.
Let's see what's been washed up today?
Of course, more of these.
Oh!
What's this?
This could be promising.
(GRUNTING)
- Hey, guys!
It's luau time!
- Yeah, yeah.
Be right there.
(GASPING)
Yee-haa!
(GROANING)
Oh!
Hi, Rosie!
Check out these delicious treats!
Gorgeous.
Just gorgeous!
- (BUGS BUZZING)
- Just look at all those bugs.
(SMACKING LIPS) Mmm.
The beetles are the best.
Crunchy on the outside with a soft, gooey centre.
Hey!
Where did it go?
- My kind of bug.
- You thief!
Carmello, that wasn't very nice.
(CLINKING)
Aren't you joining us for our luau today, Mak?
We're all here.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I'll...
I'll be right there.
(SOFTLY) Do we really need a luau every day?
- KIKI:
So what did you bring today?
- (SIGHING)
I'm not sure what it is.
I meant food for the luau.
(SCOFFS) Of course he didn't bring anything for the luau.
Oh, this is beautiful!
Hey, guys, guys!
I think I really found something important this time!
Check this out!
Where?
What?
Scrubby, you're really going blind.
Over here.
Ooh, smells delicious.
No, Scrubby, no.
It's not food!
It's proof that there's more to the world than just our island!
(SIGHING) Here we go again.
It's true!
Can't we just eat in peace for once?
Sure, no problem, as long as you can tell me where this came from!
- From the water.
- I vote for Carmello.
I too vote for Carmello.
(MOCKING) I too vote for Carmello!
Oh, come on, this isn't an election!
This thingamabobble is... is... ls what?
You know what I think, Mak?
That thingy is whatever you want to believe it is.
Exactly.
You are one hopeless dreamer.
Did you forget you almost died of exhaustion flying across the ocean looking for this other world of yours?
My dear macaw, you must wake up and smell the papaya, for this is the world!
I don't care what you guys say.
There's a bigger world out there and I intend to find it.

You got that right.
If you're fixin' to upchuck, find your way downwind!
Ah.
Oh...
Your poor stomach...

(ALL LAUGHING)
Cannibals?
We made our choice to go to sea, right, Aynsley, old pal?
And I swear, I'll not regret it.
Whoa!
(WHISPERS) All right.
Go and bring me something to eat!
Right, lovey.
I won't fail you.

Oh, I was, uh, just making sure my chicken food...

No, warm.
Warm and comfy.

Don't get your fur all in a knot.
So, then, where were we?
Knock it off!
You cats belong down below.
And stay away from our chickens!

And that goes for you as well!

Who does that green-gilled landlubber think he is?
Uh, the human who threw us into the hold?
This is our ship!
Wretched as it is, it's home!
Mark my word, Mal, someday, somehow, that canine and his human will pay!
(CHUCKLING) I'm with ya there, May.
They'll pay, all right.
Uh, how much exactly are we charging 'em?
(SIGHING)
That should teach them to mess with our egg supply, huh, old boy?
Eggs.
(GAGGING) Oh, no, not again.
(CHUCKLING) Buck up, boyo.
Ah, looks like we've got one doozy of a storm brewin'.
(THUNDER RUMBLING)
(WIND HOWLING)
(EXCLAIMS) So much for a peaceful meal.
- Whoa!
- Oh!
Oh, nobody saw that one coming!
- Whoa!
- Hang on, Carmello.
Perhaps it would be wise to move this soiree to the cave.
Let's get moving.
This is going to be a nasty one.
I'm with you on that call.
And Mak, grab the pineapple!
(GRUNTING)
Like we really needed this pineapple.
All hands on deck!
Get them sails down!
And secure the yardarms tight!
Get yourself below, mate!
Best you ride out the storm there!

Nice try, Pango, but it's hopeless.

Oh.

Ah!
We have to do something!

- Ouch!
(GROANING)

This just went from bad to worse.
Don't worry, guys, that branch looks pretty solid to me.
Right, but how do we get down?
- You got me there.

(ALL SNORING)
(LOUD RUMBLING)
Whoa, whoa!
Did you hear that sound?
- What's out there, Mak?
- I have no idea.
I've never heard a sound like that before.
(YAWNING) Can you see anything?
MAK:
Not a thing.
Unfortunately, we're going to have to wait until morning.
Same old stuff.
Shells and more shells.
Small ones, big ones...
That's a new taste.
Earthy, with a slight touch of salt.
(STRAINING) Come on.
Come to papa.
- (CLATTERING)
- Huh?
Hey, Scrubs, what did you find?
What is it you're eating?
I don't know but it's delicious.
Aw, Scrubs!
You know I collect stuff like this.
(SNIFFING)
My nose tells me there's more goodies up at Rocky Point.
(SNIFFING)
(GASPING) Look at that!
(STAMMERING) Woolly c-c-caterpillars!
See?
I was right.
This is the most incredible proof that there's another world out there!
ROSIE:
No.
Look behind you.
What are you talking about?
Behind me?
- Ah!
- (CLATTERING)
(GASPING) I can't believe it.
(GASPING) It's the thing we heard dying last night.
What do you think it is?
The other world.
I've got to get a closer look.
Mak, don't!
We have no idea what it is.
It's too dangerous, Mak!
But this is amazing!
I was right!
I knew it, I knew it.
I knew it!
This is from the other world!
I have never seen anything like this!
Incredible!
(LAUGHING)
Huh?
Ah!
(MUFFLED GROANING)
(SPITTING)
(GASPS)
(BANGING)
- Mak should be more careful.
- Pangy's right.
We should keep our distance.
(STAMMERING) What's going on?
- (BANGING CONTINUES)
- Easy now, whatever you are.
I just want to talk.
(EXCLAIMING)
Sea monsters.
- (BARKING) - (ALL SCREAMING)
Wow!
Look at this.
There's hardly any ship left, Aynsley.
- Hello!
- (SNIFFING)
Is anyone out there?
- Hey!
Can anyone hear me?
- (GASPING) Ooh.
Look at it.
CRUSOE:
Captain!
Bosun!
- Anyone?
- It's... hideous!
Where did they all go?
I can't believe everyone is really gone.
Looks like there's just the two of us.
Let's go to shore.
Hang on, Aynsley, the current's really strong.
(CRUSOE GRUNTING)
(ALL GASPING)
Uh-oh.
(LAUGHING)
Oh, land, sweet land!
Oh.
It's so good to be alive, Aynsley.
Bob's your uncle, sea monsters walking on land?
Uh-oh, we're in big trouble.
Only one thing has two legs.
A bird!
And that ain't no bird I've ever seen.
Yeah.
He can't even fly.
(SNIFFING)
(ALL GASPING)
(GASPING)
(BARKING)
(GASPS)
That monster is going to eat Carmello!
CRUSOE:
What's going on, Aynsley?
We gotta do something, now!
Hurry, make as much noise as you can.
We have to scare those sea monsters off!
Come back here, Aynsley!
- Stay close together.
- (BARKING CONTINUES)
We don't know what's out there.
- (CLANKING)
- What was that?
Aynsley!
Aynsley, what's that noise?
Ah!
Cannibals, Aynsley, Cannibals!
We have to get off this island!
The sailor warned us.
(WHIMPERING)
They'll skin us alive and eat us!
Hurry, old boy.
They're coming for us!
Uh, get inside the barrel.
Go, boy, go.
There.
Yes.
Guys, guys, guys.
What are you doing?
Scaring off the sea monsters, thank you very much.
And what if they aren't sea monsters?
Did you see the furry one's teeth?
He'll rip us to shreds!
Everybody calm down!
We're safe here.
Are we?
We really don't know what those creatures are capable of!
I know one thing they're capable of, leaving the island!
What?
Oh, no!
Come on, this can't be happening to me.
He's actually leaving.
We did it!
We got rid of him.
Yeah, we scared them big time!
Will somebody tell me what's happening?
I'll tell you what's going on.
You guys have ruined my chance to get off this island and see the world.
You really don't get it, do you?
You think this paradise.
Well, it is not!
It meant so much to me.
(GRUNTING)
- He's back.
- Oh, no, here we go again.
Back?
Are you serious?
Let me see!
Here's what we're going to do.
We stay out of sight and we keep an eye on them, see what they plan on doing.
OK?
OK, then.
Nobody goes on the beach.
That goes for you, too, Scrubby.
Yeah, yeah.
I heard ya.
Didn't even get to finish my breakfast.
(ALL SNORING)
(SNIFFING)
All those new smells are driving me crazy!
I gotta go check it out.
ROSIE: (WHISPERING) Where you going, Scrubby?
Psst!
Come back.
It's not safe out there.
Can't let all those tasty morsels get washed away.
If I recall correctly, didn't Mak say we should all stay out of sight?
He did!
Speaking of which, where is Mak?
Sorry about today, old friend.
That was a pretty inept attempt.
Oh, what was I thinking?
I haven't the foggiest idea where we are, nor, for that matter, the slightest inkling in which direction to set sail.
Someone's bound to come and save us, old boy.
- (WHIMPERING)
- I'm sure of it.
If those cannibals come back, we'll be ready for them.
(SNORING)
- (OBJECTS CLATTERING) - (GASPING)
Who's out there?
Show yourselves!
My dog'll tear you to shreds!
And I have a musket!
- (SCRUBBY BLEATING)
- Huh?
A goat?
(CHUCKLING) It's just a goat.
(CLATTERS)
- (CAWS)
- And a bird.
Maybe there aren't any cannibals after all.
Mak, what were you doing out there all by yourself?
I thought you said we should stay hidden?
I was just checking things out is all.
What's all the commotion about, anyway?
Well, Epi just made a good point.
I just suggested, hypothetically, that possibly the sea monster lost that thingamajig you found.
And maybe he's come to get it back!
Along with us!
It's one of two things for sure, a coincidence or a bad omen.
Either way, you need to get rid of it.
Why not just give it back to the sea monsters?
Peachy idea.
No way!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa...
- You're kidding?
You're so selfish!
Selfish?
OK.
Uh, maybe.
Just give me time to think about it.
But if I do give it back, you're all coming with me.
(ALL GROANING)
(SIGHS)
Well.
All right, then, Aynsley, we've got some work to do.
Let's save whatever we can before it is all lost to the sea.
(WHIMPERING)
(GRUNTS)
- (SCRUBBY SNORING)
- How's it looking, mate?
They're taking over our beach.
He's pulling strange stuff out from the sea.
I suppose this means they're not leaving any time soon, then?
Looks that way.
(GRUNTING)
(SNORING)
(YAWNING)
Do you see how the four-legged one sleeps all day while the big one does the work?
No, but I'll take your word for it.
I'll bet ya the sleeping one's the boss.
(STRAINING)
(PANTING)
(GASPING) Look, he stripped off his skin!
Ugh, I'm going to be sick.
TUESDAY:
None of us knew it at the time, but we were being watched by the real monsters on the island.
(INSECT BUZZING)
Some luck, huh, May?
That green-gilled human and his mangy mutt made it safely here.
How are we gonna deal with him?
He might be a problem for us.
Don't you worry.
I'll figure out a way to get rid of them quick enough.
For the time being, we sit, watch and wait.
Aw, come on, May, I'm starving here.
And what did I just say?
(CHOKING) Sit.
Watch.
Wait.
That's right.
Now, stay focused!
We've got the upper claw.
No one knows we're here.
Which means we take our time and we pick them off one by one.
(LAUGHING)
(GRUNTING)
Ah, look, Aynsley!
These could come in very handy.
I'd better practice a bit before we venture out there to get our dinner, right, boy?

I don't know about you, Scrubby, but I plan on staying as far away from that monster as possible.
- (PANTING)
- What was that all about?
- I have absolutely no idea.
- (GUNSHOT)
But what we need to find out is what these newcomer's intentions are.
From the sound of it, they're up to no good.
Obviously they're trying to kill us.
Maybe.
But maybe not.
The truth of the matter is that these newcomers have brought nothing but trouble to our paradise.
That is a fact.
Fine.
Then do like I asked and stay out of sight.
They're proof that there's another world out there and I'm going to find out whether they're friend or foe.
You really don't get it, do you?
(GUNSHOT)
- (GUNSHOT)
- Whoa!
That was close.
OK, let's give this a go one last time.
Ah!
Did you see that, Aynsley?
I did it!
I hit the mark!
(SIGHS)
Let's go fix something to eat, old boy.
(CHUCKLING) That was a miracle, I never thought I'd hit it!
Well, maybe we'll eat something after all.
TUESDAY:
I was starting to wonder if everyone wasn't right.
The new world was finally here and I had no idea if I was ready for it or not.

(SLURPS) Mmm...
That's the biggest rat I've ever seen.
Go for the throat, let's make this quick.
Wait, the human!
(ROSIE GRUNTING)
Oh, I can't do it, boy.
Go on!
Shoo!
Go!
What now?
Sorry, pal, I've never shot anything before.
What say we try fishing?
(SNIFFING) What's burning?
U-(HISSING)
That would be me.
You smell like burnt biscuits.
Shh!
Something's coming.
Looks like Rosie was here.
That's strange, Rosie never leaves any food behind.
- (YOWLING)
- Oh!
Oh, no.
(SCREAMING)
Would you prefer white or dark meat for brunch, darling?
I prefer...
Dog!
Time to get even, ratter!
(GROWLING)
CRUSOE:
Hold on, Aynsley!
I'm coming!
Those blasted ratters, they did survive after all!
Ah, I'm hit!
Run for it!
(SIGHS)
- Good dog.
- (WHIMPERING)
You all right, old boy?
(SQUAWKS)
Did you hear that?
Over there.
Oh, look, it's a bird, a beautiful parrot.
- (GROANING)
- So, Aynsley, that's what all the fuss was about.
Those ratters were after the bird.
You've done good, old boy.
And you...
We're going to fix you up straight away.
Look, Aynsley, a ring!
That can only mean one thing.
Sailors have set foot on this island before.
I believe there's hope for us after all.
You can come out guys, there's no one around.
SCRUBBY:
It's too dark, I can't see a thing.
This is the very spot where that sea monster attacked me.
Well, sort of.
Oh, are muse...
We shouldn't have let him go alone.
Maybe he's moulting.
Oh, that's a bit of a stretch, Pango.
Just wait till I get my hooves on them.
Any way you look at it, this is not good.
Mak can't be gone.
- (MAL CHUCKLING)
- What's that?
And who are you two?
Just two homeless castaways.
We were held captive by that human for months with nothing to eat but the crumbs from his table.
What about our friend?
Did you see him, by any chance?
Oh, 'tis a true tragedy, all right.
Oh, an unfortunate turn of events.
You see, we caused... (GROANS)
(CHUCKLING NERVOUSLY) We saw the whole thing.
Well, come on, let's hear it.
What are you waiting for?
We'll tell you what happened to your friend but I'm warning ya, it ain't pretty.
You see, the human loves to eat birds and I am afraid your friend got...
Trapped.
Mmm-hmm.
(SQUAWKING)
This should only take a minute.
It's just dislocated.
But it's going to hurt a bit... (SQUAWKING)
Don't worry, you'll feel better in a day or two, though you won't be able to fly right away.
Well, then,
I suppose you'll need a name if you're going to stay here for a while.
Let's see.
By my reckoning, today's Tuesday.
That's as good a name as any, eh?
Can you say Tuesday?
Tuesday?
(SQUAWKING)
(LAUGHING)
Well, not quit.
But that's a start.
Take care of our new friend, boy.
I'd better offload as much stuff as I can.
No telling how long the ship will stay in one piece.
- (GROWLS SOFTLY) - (GULPS)
(SQUAWKING)
They're nothing but cannibals!
Murderers!
I say we run 'em off our island!
Drive them monsters back into the sea!
Perhaps a plan might be to force them to live on Curse Island!
Yeah!
Oh, yes, yes, yes!
(LAUGHING)
Curse Island!
Uh, what exactly is Curse Island?
Ooh!
The end of the earth, mate.
No one's ever made it back from there.
Yeah.
There's nothing there but bugs.
Lots and lots of nasty bugs.
Sounds perfect.
Drive them to Curse Island.
That's not going to work.
You have a better idea?
Uh, no.
Right.
So, then, where were we?
(SQUAWKING)
Stop your flapping about, bird.
You need to be resting that wing of yours.
(PANTING) What do you want from me?
I just want to talk.
The name's Aynsley, and from what I understand, yours is Tuesday.
Call me whatever you want, except dinner.
Dinner?
We're not going to eat you.
We saved your life!
Either way, you'll not make much of a meal.
Not like the fat, juicy turkeys we have back home.
- (SQUAWKING)
- Relax, my master likes you.
You said your master?
You did not think that I... (LAUGHING)
Oh, I like you.
You're funny.
I've never seen a bird like you in England.
Eng-land.
Tell me more, Aynsley.
Aye, laddie.
England, my island, just one fantastic place in a sea of many lands.
I knew it!
Crusoe wants to explore them all.
If we ever get off this one.
You know, you're the first to come from the outside world.
Oh, dear, that's not good news.
(CARMELLO BLOWING)
Uh, hold on a second.
We're made up like this because...
Because you look fierce.
Now, get your heads in the game, everyone!
(SOFTLY) We have the perfect opportunity.
The dog and that bird are still on the ship.
Right.
Listen up!
Here's the plan.
We'll deal with the hairy beast on the ship.
The rest of you go for the human on the beach.
What's a ship?
That wooden thing on the beach.
(SIGHS)
As soon as we're on the ship, the wooden thing, you attack!
Right, then.
Fierce, fierce, fierce.
So, I'm a fierce coconut?
(CHUCKLING)
I should go tell my friends that I'm OK.
You'd better stay put, you're in no condition to fly.
Well, look at this.
We can kill two birds with one stone.
Hmm?
There's two birds now?
Oh, shut it!
Just follow my lead.
Look, look!
That tail feather.
He's wearing Mak like a trophy!
That is so wrong!
Attack!
Let's get him!
(SCREAMING)
(SCREECHING)
Whoa...
- (BRAYING)
- Yee-haw!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Aysnley, we'd better go.
What's going on out there?
They've all gone mad.
- Ah!
- It appears as if your friends
- have come to avenge your death.
- I'm not dead.
Oh, we're going to take care of that right now!
Aynsley!
Help!
AYNSLEY:
I have had it with you!
- (GROWLING) - (MEOWING)
- Ah!
- (HISSING)
(MAL GROANING)
Aynsley!
(SCREAMS)
Whoa...
(SHRIEKS)
(AYNSLEY GROWLING)
Come on down, then!
Get off me!
Aynsley!
(GROWLING)
(GRUNTS)
(COUGHING)
Tuesday?
(SQUAWKING)
(AYNSLEY HOWLING)
- Hold on!
That sounded like...
- Mak!
Aynsley!
Mak, get out!
Kiki!
(SCREAMS)
Mak.
I'm coming, boy!
(GROANS)
Rotten cats!
You're to blame for all this!
- (STRAINING)
- AYNSLEY:
You must leave the ship now.
Go!
- Aynsley!
- Go!
(SCREAMING)
(ALL EXCLAIMING)
What's happening here?
I thought Mak was dead.
We all did, but I don't think he made it this time.
That would be horrible!
Come on, guys, we'd better move back now.
Oh, no!
Aynsley.
What have I done'?
(PANTING)
- (HICCUPS) Land.
- (GROANS)
Land!
We're saved, May!
I thought we were goners.
Oh, will you just shut up?
- (INSECTS BUZZING)
- What's that noise?
- That would be bugs.
- Bugs!
- Curse Island!
- (MAY SCREAMING)
Rest in peace, old boy.
(SIGHS)
(SQUAWKS)
Tuesday!
(SQUAWKS)
Psst!
(WHISPERING) Mak!
Kiki!
- Mak, you're hurt.
- I'll be OK.
I'm sure glad to see you.
- I was worried!
- Me, too.
Come on, now's your chance to get away.
- I can't.
- Let me help you.
No, no...
I...
I just...
I don't want to get away.
What?
You don't understand.
It's all those cats' fault.
- What do you mean?
- They attacked me.
He fixed my wing.
And his dog gave his life to save me.
I can't leave him now.
Oh, I see.
So, he's going to take care of you?
Look, he's going to need my help to survive.
I owe him that.
Exactly how do you plan on doing that?
I mean, look at him!
- (GRUNTING) - (CLATTERING)
(SIGHS)
(GROANING) Tuesday, help!
(CHUCKLING)
I don't believe it.
Those cats used us and Mak as well and what do we do?
We attack the human.
Hold on, then.
So what you're saying is Kiki's to blame for all this?
- Oh, afraid so!
- That's not fair.
We all thought Mak was dead.
Didn't we?
Oh, this is not good, mates.
Yeah.
We've made a real mess of things.
Ah, it looks that way, Epi, gal.
Where you going, Rosie?
ROSIE:
Off to clean up our mess!
I'm in.
Well, let's get cracking then, mates!
Wait a second!
(SIGHS) You're going to make an even bigger mess of things.
(GASPS) The wild beasts!
They're going to get us!
(SQUAWKING)
Stay right where you are.
(ALL GASPING)
I've got a special treat for all of you.
Oh.
(SCRUBBY BLEATING)
I just want to give you some biscuits is all.
They're quite good.
I finished off your dog, human, and I promise, one day, you and the rest of your lot will join him.
(GAGS)
Now, that is the taste of desperation.
Try the red ones.
They taste just like chicken.
Mmm!
(YAWNING)
(YAWNING)
What...
What?
Do you want to show me something?
All right.
All right, let's go.
(GRUNTING)
Oh, Tuesday, this is fantastic!
Fresh water!
Good job, Tuesday.
(SQUAWKING)
What?
You want me to follow you?
OK, I'm coming.
Hey, guys, look who's here.
(ALL SCREAMING)
Relax, there's nothing to be afraid of.
Stay right where you are.
I'll be right back.
What got into him?
- Why is he running away?
- Beats me.
- Maybe it's your smell.
- Huh?
(CHUCKLING)
Try one of these, it's really good.
And some for you.
Enjoy!
(SNIFFING)
- (BLEATING) - (GRUNTS)
Say, Tuesday, where is pretty bird?
I haven't seen her yet.
Pretty bird!
(SQUAWKS)
No need to yell, Mak, I mean, Tuesday.
I'm right here.
There you are, pretty bird.
Here, you see?
I won't hurt you.
Come on, don't be afraid.
Come on, pretty bird.
Ouch!
(CHUCKLES)
(SCRUBBY BLEATING)
Well, friendships aren't made in a day.
We'll take it one step at a time, right, Tuesday?
(SQUAWS) One step.
(INSECTS BUZZING)
(MEOWING)
I can't, May.
The current's too strong.
- So you failed again, did you?
- Oh... (WAILING)
Oh, stop feeling sorry for yourself.
Our time will come.
Soon there will be more of us.
Revenge will be sweet.
Oh!
(MEOWING)
(CLATTERING)
Ah!
- (CLANGING) - (SCRUBBY GRUNTING)
(GROANING)
Oh!
That hurt.
Why, you can't see a bloody thing, can you, you old goat?
We're going to have to fix that.
There you are.
That should help.
(EXCLAIMS)
(LAUGHING)
Whoo-hoo!
Why, Rosie, you're no pig.
Hey!
What's gotten into you?
You're gorgeous!
Easy. big boy.
Whoo!
Oh!
Ow!
Oh.
Oh, no!
Whoa!
No, no, no, no, no!
No, no.
Ah!
Oh!
No.
Oh, no!
- Tuesday, help!
- (SQUAWKING)
(GRUNTING) Hey. guys!
(SNORTING)
(SQUAWKING)
Oh, never mind.
This is hopeless.
(SIGHING)
How am I ever going to survive on this island?
(SIGHING)
(LAUGHS)
Yes, of course, that's it!
I have to build a treehouse.
Ha-ha!
(SAWING)
(SHRIEKS)
It's raining tree limbs.
Ooh.
Hmm, tastes good enough to eat.
Is there anything you wouldn't eat?
Hey, Pango.
What's he doing?
Don't know, mate.
This cobber's gone b-b-bonkers on us.
He's destroying the tree!
(MUTTERING) Must keep sawing...
Need to finish shelter.
- Must build...
- (INSECTS BUZZING)
Mmm.
Ah!
Yes, sir.
More porridge, please.
(SNORING)
TUESDAY:
We had no clue what Crusoe was up to.
Sawing?
Porridge?
Yep, as Pango would say, he was bonkers to the max.
How are you coming along, May?
- (KITTENS MEWING)
- Can I have just a little a peek'?
Can you just wait?
I'm cleaning them up.
Well, could you at least tell me how big a litter we have?
More than we'll ever be able to feed, I'm afraid.
(MEWING)
- Oh, look at it...
- (HISSING)
Hey!
(MEOWING)
(KITTENS MEWING)
(SQUAWKS)
ow!
That smarts.
I'm trying to work here.
Go eat somewhere else.
At this rate, I'll never get this built.
I told you, go!
Ah, never mind.
What I wouldn't give for an extra set of hands.
TUESDAY:
For all his pounding and sawing, we couldn't figure out what he was actually doing.
Whoa!
Now what is going on?
Argh, really?
TUESDAY:
I couldn't blame Rosie.
When you've got an itch, you've gotta scratch it!
But poor Crusoe, he didn't see it that way.
He had had enough.
And that's when it hit me!
A nest!
- Mmm-mmm.
- Hey, guys!
I figured out what he's doing.
Uh, making a mess?
No.
He's building a shelter!
Huh?
Don't follow ya, mate.
He's building a nest!
- A nest?
- So he is a bird.
Scrubs.
He's building a human nest in the tree!
Oh!
Pretty clever!
- I've never slept in a tree.
- (CHUCKLES)
If he stocks it with food, you'll sleep in a tree.
Good point!
So, guys, I got an idea.
What do ya say we help him out, get this nest of his built?
I must have been crazy thinking I could build this all by my... self.
TUESDAY:
We didn't really have any idea what we were getting into.
We just figured let's help, use whatever abilities we had and hoped it all worked.
Well, I'll be gobsmacked!
(ROSIE GRUNTING)
Slowly, slowly.
(SQUAWKS) Slowly, slowly.
That's it, just a little more.
- (GRUNTING) - (EPI HUMMING)
Hi, Epi!
Where are you headed with all that food?
Whoa!
I need a little help here, guys!
- Easy.
- Hmm, salty.
Not that kind of help.
No, no.
That tickles!
Epi, hold up.
I'm starving!
Whoa!
Help!
TUESDAY:
Things didn't always go smoothly.
And we had our ups and downs, that's for sure.
But everyone was in fine spirits.
And Crusoe seemed, well, happy.
He made a funny little door for Epi and Pango to get into the nest.
It was a pretty good idea.
After a few modifications, that is.
(CHUCKLING)
We became a real team, playing all these funny games Crusoe came up with.
He had all sorts of crazy ideas.
- Oh!
Like hiding seeds in the ground.
- (T H U M Pl N G)
(BAGPIPES PLAYING)
Crusoe had a funny way of eating.
He peeled the fruit.
(CHUCKLING) And boy, did he eat slow.
Ah!
(SNORTING)
It took quite a while, but despite his awkwardness and all of his flaws,
Crusoe surprised even the most sceptical among us.
That's it, that's it.
Watch your step.
I just put the finishing touches on our new home.
(SQUAWKS) New home.
Hold it right there.
First thing we must do is christen the place.
It's good luck, you know.
I christen thee...
Oh!
(LAUGHING) Oh, never mind.
Three cheers for us.
Wow!
Now, look at that.
(GASPS) It's so beautiful!
Hip, hip, hooray!
(PLAYING BAGPIPES)
What in the world is that noise he's making?
- Sounds like Scrubby when he needs food!
- Hmm!
It's painful, mates.
Let's get outta here.
Oh!
Personally, I think it sounds beautiful.
(SIGHING)
A party and we weren't invited.
MAY:
Mal!
Quit your daydreaming.
I am starving here!
Oh, coming.
(KITTENS MEOWING)
You know how difficult it is in my condition to hunt right now.
Have you tried to make it to the other island lately?
Oh, May.
You know the last time I tried I almost drowned.
I'm afraid we're stuck with just the bugs and spiders.
They sound delicious.
Now, go and hunt some up for me.
Right, darling.
I'll wrap 'em in seaweed just the way you like 'em.
TUESDAY:
With the nest completed, Crusoe moved on to a new project.
We didn't have to forage for food, we had this great nest.
And we even had indoor plumbing!
Paradise just got better.
(SIGHING)
That human sure has made life peachy for us.
Rosie, he's bonzer to the max.
I tell ya, old girl, if this new world Mak talks about is this cushy, it may not be that bad after all.
Getting a little plump, aren't we?
Sitting around all day.
Ain't nothing wrong with a few curves, Kiki, honey.
(WHISTLING)
With Crusoe doing the fishing, we'll be putting some curves on you too in no time, Kiki.
Ooh, what do we have here?
Hmm.
Looks like Crusoe is going to put your fishing skills to shame, Kiki.
(HUFFS)
TUESDAY:
As time passed, life became more and more comfortable for us all.
Yet Crusoe seemed very sad at times.
He missed his old world.
He built a strange tower an the highest point of the island, with bright lights burning every night.
Another day, no ships in sight, little fella.
What I wouldn't give to see the sun set over the Thames.
Thames?
(YAWNING)
Come on, partner.
I don't get it.
Why does he light this every night?
In the hope that some other humans will pass by.
If they see the signal, they'll come and rescue him.
TUESDAY:
I knew the chances of leaving this island were becoming slimmer as time went by.
I just didn't know how slim.
More humans on our island?
(SCOFFS) That's not going to happen.
(THUNDER RUMBLING)
(CLEARING THROAT)
And now, my friends, like all good Englishmen, a moment of silence to give thanks for this bountiful harvest.
Psst!
Mind your manners.
- Our host is...
- Taking a snooze, it appears.
(CHUCKLING) Or worse.
(FLY BUZZING)
Psst!
Hey, stop fooling around.
- (THUNDER CRACKLING) - (WIND HOWLING)
At least we're not out in that weather.
Oh, it's miserable out there.
Listen to you guys!
We're meant to live in the weather.
(SCOFFS) Have you all gone soft?
Whoa, whoa, Kiki.
Why get so worked up?
Oh, you haven't seen worked up.
Answer me this.
What happens to us when Crusoe leaves this island?
I mean, have you thought of that?
Kiki, now...
Now, listen.
Oh, I'm listening.
I'm listening loud and clear, Mak!
Shall we eat'?
(WIND WHISTLING)
(GROANING) If I could just find one little morsel.
One measly little morsel.
(GASPS) It's mine!
It's all mine!
Mine, mine, mine, mine!
(LAUGHING)
(CATS MEOWING)
(HISSING)
- What's yours?
- Nothing.
You wouldn't be depriving your family, now, would you, sweetheart?
Yes.
I mean no.
(GROWLS)
Oh!
Oh, May, that hurts.
- Shame on you!
I should...
- (THUNDER RUMBLING)
Look, the ship's falling apart.
Our luck is turning.
Maybe we'll be able to make it back to the main island after all.
Hey, what do you say we go outside and have some fun on the waterslide?
Great idea!
I love all the smells after a good rain.
I'll catch up with you guys later.
I'd better find Kiki first, make sure she's all right.
Why didn't that ship just vanish into the sea?
Our lives are never going to be the same again.
(YELLS)
(SCREAMING)
Shall we have a little snack before we move on to the main island?
Oh!
(GASPS)
- (SNARLING)
- Help!
Scream all you want, little bird.
No one's going to save you now.
(MIMICKING CRUSOE) I'll be the son of a sea cook!
Watch out, children, it's the human!
Get your filthy paws off my bird!
Epi, Pango, to the left.
We'd better get out of here, quick!
Come on, everyone, we've got them surrounded!
Attack!
Ka-boom!
Oh, he got me.
(GROANING)
- (SQUAWKING) - (SNARLING)
If this is heaven, why are you here?
They're heading for the big island!
They're everywhere!
It's all my fault!
We have to warn the others!
Get to the nest!
Now, hurry!
(SQUAWKING)
- (SQUAWKS) Predators!
- What?
- Did he say predators?
- (GASPING)
(SCREAMS)
Oh, no!
Hang on, everyone, I'll get my musket.
(GRUNTING)
(ROSIE SCREAMING)
Oh!
- Batten down the hatches!
- (TUESDAY SQUAWKS)
TUESDAY:
Batten down the hatches!
I just need a little powder and then some shot.
That's it, Tuesday, close everything up.
Ow!
Ah!
They're everywhere!
Get off of me!
Ah!
Ah!
(SCREAMING)
- (SQUAWKING) - (SNARLING)
Stay away, you bloody ratters!
(GRUNTING)
(LOW GROWLING)
(SQUAWKS)
Tuesday, ah!
- Help!
- (GASPS)
Get me down from here!
I may not know human but that's "help" in any language.
Carmello!
Crusoe needs our help.
Oh!
Ah!
- (SNARLING)
- Uh-oh!
(MEOWING)
Oh, duck!
Ooh!
Hurry, Epi!
(ALL SCREAMING)
- (SCREAMING)
- Whoa!
Whoa!
Oh!
Yee-haa!
Uh-oh.
(GRUNTING)
Pango!
Over here!
Jump!
- Stand back, Epi!
- Ooh!
Hurry!
He's right behind you!
(MEOWING)
Yee-haa!
Go. go!
(GRUNTING)
I need my musket.
(ROSIE SQUEALING)
(CRUSOE SCREAMING)
Now look what you've done!
You guys stay put!
(GRUNTING)
Oh, not again!
Stay away, you mangy cat!
Hang on, Crusoe!
(GRUNTING)
(YELPS)
Good job, buddy.
(SCREAMS)
(GASPING)
(SCREAMING)
Huh?
(CHUCKLING) That wasn't so bad.
Keep pushing.
I'll take care of these blighters!
(MEOWING)
Whoa!
Whoa!
Pango!
(YELLS) Help!
Whoa!
That's awful high.
Come on, you can make it.
Jump!
Oh, my.
Here goes.
Ooh!
(GRUNTING)
- Oh, dear.
- Good work!
Now, let's get out of here.
OK.
So long, furball!
(YELPS)
(LAUGHING)
Hungry, are we?
Well, then, take that!
And how about a banana?
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
So long, Knucklehead!
- (MEOWS) - (SPLASHING)
(GRUNTING)
Scrubby, the door!
(SHRIEKING)
- (GROWLING) - (GRUNTING)
Come on!
(ROSIE YELLING)
My turn!
(MEOWS)
Hello there.
(CAT SCREAMING)
Many thanks, Scrubs.
(PANGO AND EPI SCREAMING)
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Over here, Epi, girl!
Get in the bucket!
Going up!
(LAUGHING)
Pango, get him off!
- (EPI GRUNTS) - (PANGO SCREAMS)
Get off, you mangy cat!
(SCREAMING)
Good work, Epi!
(LAUGHING)
- They'll never get me.
- (BOTH LAUGHING)
- We got rid of 'em, didn't we?
- (SNARLING)
- Epi!
- (EPI SCREAMING)
Pango!
- (EPI SCREAMING)
- Huh?
Whoa!
Help me.
Look out behind you, Epi!
(YELLING)
(ALL SCREAMING)
EPI:
Whoa!
Whoa!
- Help!
- No!
Epi!
Hang on, I'm coming!
- Whoa!
- (EPI SCREAMING)
Let go of me!
(PANTING)
(SCREAMS)
(SCREAMS)
(GRUNTING)
The cats are trying to get in through the hatch!
No!
Rosie, no, that was Crusoe.
- Oops!
- Help me get this open.
Oh, I hope you didn't hurt him.
Oh!
Everybody OK?
Everybody except Crusoe.
TUESDAY:
Come on guys, all together.
It's heavy.
CARMELLO:
Spread out, Rosie.
We need all the muscle we can muster!
ROSIE:
Really?
OK, OK.
One, two, three!
Well, that's a bit of a bummer, mates.
We need Crusoe!
How's he doing, Kiki?
He's alive but he won't be of any use to us.
We're going to need a miracle to hold all these cats back.
- (CATS MEOWING)
- I got it.
The musket!
Watch out, guys, it's going to be noisy!
Are you sure that's a good idea?
It's worth a try.
What else can we do?
(CATS POUNDING AND MEOWING)
Uh-huh.
This could be a bit more complicated than I thought.
MAY:
Hmm, the human's out.
Time to make our move.
Hurry!
We can't hold them off much longer.
He always pulls that thingamajig back first!
OK, get ready.
Huh?
That's weird.
Hmm.
What's happening in there?
- (CATS SNARLING) - (GRUNTING)
Hey, Tuesday, maybe this thingy has something to do with it.
What thingy?
(ALL MEOWING)
(GRUNTING)
(SQUAWKS)
- (GUNSHOT)
- Ah!
(CATS SCREECHING)
(TUESDAY GROANING)
(COUGHING)
Now what?
You know they're going to come back!
Maybe Crusoe will come to and save us.
I hate to break it to you guys.
We're on our own.
We have to get out of here, hide someplace.
What about Crusoe?
Pango's right!
We can't leave him here.
Guys, guys, it may not be perfect, but I think I've got a plan.
Well, you'd better lay it out, cos we're out of time.
All right, children, calm down.
They just got lucky this time.
We're going to sneak up on them and make them pay.
Now let's show them what we're made of!
(GROANING)
Oh. yeah!
(STRAINING)
(SQUAWKS)
Aw, you've got a broken wing, have you?
Don't worry.
We'll put you out of my misery.
Stay back or I'll shoot!
Not so brave now, are you?
Uh-oh!
(CHUCKLING)
Appears your luck has just run out.
Oh!
(SQUAWKS)
Whoa!
You'll have to be quicker than that, ratter!
Get him!
He can't fly!
That should take care of you quite nicely.
Sweet dreams from your favourite ratter.
- (SQUAWKING)
- Get ready!
- We got him cornered, May.
- Then, let's finish him off once and for all.
Catch me if you can, ratter!
(CATS MEOWING)
Whoa!
Hold on!
Rosie, stop!
We have to wait for the signal.
(SQUAWKS)
This is it, give it all you have, Rosie!
(STRAINING)
- Huh?
What's going on?
- They tricked us.
Hold on to that tail, I'll take care of him.
We're not so cocky any more, are we?
(SQUAWKING)
- (SQUAWKING)
- Tuesday's in trouble!
Ah!
(SCREAMING)
Oh, ho!
That was a bonzer plan you had there, mate.
Couldn't have done it without you guys.
Huh?
The fire!
Crusoe!
Crusoe!
(GRUNTING)
Over here.
(GRUNTS)
(SQUAWKING)
(SCREAMING)
Ouch, that must have really hurt!
We pulled Crusoe out to safety, unconscious but alive.
And then, out of the blue, we get cannon-blasted from your ship.
Aye.
The Captain can be one tough bloke.
What do you expect?
They're pirates, after all.
Pirates?
(CHUCKLING) You know, like them nasty ratters, only worse.
I had a pack of crazed cats on my right.
I was sure I was a goner!
I took my musket in one hand, my sword in the other and carved a swath to the savage hordes.
Whoa!
(CHUCKLING)
It was horrible, Captain!
That is the most fantastical yarn I've heard in all me life!
'Tis no yarn, Captain.
Mmm.
So you say.
Well, then, 'tis time to set sail.
You and your bird can take a bunk below.
Oh, Captain.
I cannot tell you how I long to see England again.
- England?
- (PIRATES LAUGHING)
We'll not be sailing for them ports.
Lest we want to be hanging from the gallows.
- (PIRATES CONTINUE LAUGHING)
- Right, me mates?
But you see...
We...
I must...
Can you at least drop me off a bit closer to home?
You're with us now.
Once a pirate, always a pirate.
Have you got a problem with that?
- But Captain, if I might...
- Enough talk!
Off with ya!
And I'll be expectin' ya to carry your weight, lad.
Or you'll be walkin' the plank, ye will,
OI' worse.
(MEOWING)
Look!
ls it a mirage, May?
MAY:
It's not a mirage, you idiot!
It's a ship!
Children, start paddling!
♪ I ply my trade for the Union Jack
♪ Upon the seven seas
♪ And unless I eat some rancid... ♪
(YELLS)
(LAUGHING)
Hey, give it here!
That be my rum ye be drinkin'!
Oh, you want some rum, do ya?
How's me fists instead?
These are some nasty pirates.
It won't end well, I'm afraid, if we stay another moment.
Hey!
What you be fixin' to do there?
Oh, nothing.
Nothing at all.
Is that right?
That ingrate we done rescued from the island is trying to steal one of our rowboats!
If anybody gonna be stealing anything, it be us!
No, I was just...
Hey!
What's going on out here?
Bosun, he's trying to jump ship.
Get him and throw him in the brig.
Right!
Let's teach him a lesson.
Take that!
(PIRATES CLAMOURING)
(GRUNTS)
(GASPS)
Go get him!
Hey, he's gettin' away!
Grab him!
Ha, give me a piece of him!
(PIRATES LAUGHING)
There's no way off this ship, you fool!
Ah!
Whoa!
Whoa!
- Get him!
- Tuesday!
- He's mine!
- I'll grab him.
Whoa!
A raft!
(LAUGHING)
You fools couldn't hit the broadside of a barn!
Come on, lads, show me what ye be made of.
(TUESDAY MIMICKING LONG JOHN SILVER) Bosun!
Get your scurvy excuse for a pirate down to my cabin!
Now!
Aye, aye, Cap'n.
Right away!
TUESDAY:
And the rest of you fools, back to work before I give you each ten lashes of me whip!
- Blasted bird.
- (SQUAWKING)
Cap'n, he's getting away!
- Shall we send some men after him?
- Nay.
Let him go.
Oh, Captain!
Can't we fire a cannon shot, blow him to smithereens'?
Why waste a good cannonball?
Let him spend the rest of his life on that long-forgotten island.
(LAUGHING) That is, if the wild beasts don't devour him first.
(LAUGHING)
Aye, aye, Captain!
(SNIFFING)
It's been nice knowing ya, Ruf.
We did have ourselves a good run there, didn't we, Cec?
(SQUAWKING)
Jump!
(MEOWING)
(LAUGHING) I wasn't going to let those ratters get you.
We friends gotta stick together.
Nice of you to think so.

Task it a buiscuit, hold Dr. Ceci.
Stop your plan it.
Almost.
There.
We'll be shadow puppets.
Why haven't got me breakfast yet, either?
Catou!
Shadow puppets?
Seriously mate.
You are one kidney short of a meat pie.
I was..
Give me.
Go!
Get off of me, you good for nothing feline, cat!
Say you can't even get a nice sleep without some fleery, limey?
Signal fire off the starboard bow!
Signal fire!
Starboard bow!
Captain, captain!
Wake up!
You waky, waky!
Attack!
Board the ship!
Here, swashbucklirus, and what is it!
Bosun, is you?
Sorry to wake you, captain.
But there's a signal fire on the small Island off the starboard side.
What course of action shall we be taking.
Let me have a look.
Some sort of house on fire.
What's this?
Fire abroad side!
Drive those bloody beasts off.
Aye, aye Captain!
Then go and bring back whoever he is.
And Bosun, make sure they leave nothing behind of any value.
Will do, captain.
Humans?
What you go by fellow?
Crusoe, Robinson Crusoe.
Looks like them wild beasts nearly had you for dinner.
Lucky we found you when we did.
Oh, they are my.
Hold on a second mate.
Let's have a look in there.
Not a single gold tooth in his head.
Pity.
Pirates!
Hey, ye've been one lucky bloke.
Crusoe, isn't?
I'm in your debt, Captain.
Ney!
Plus me eagle eye night watch then saved yer hide.
Well, let me tell ye, blasterd bird!
No captain, he's with me.
No captain.
He's with me.
A talking parrot.
What skull duggery is this?
Trying to talk yerself, did ya?
Yes captain.
Drink up, that'll start yer stump smith.
Now, tell me more about this island of yarn.
Is there anything of...
shall we say. value on it?
All I can say is that.
I was shipwrecked, marooned.
Fending for myself with nothing but time and very few skills to survive.
Sorry about that.
I see the bird has taught ye how to drink as well.
That's not very polite Tuesday, you'll have to wait outside, I'm afraid.
Fending for myself?
Really?
Listen.
You two wanna hear the true tale of Robinson Crusoe?
Of sure, we're all ears, or at least Cecil here is.
Hey, come on, Ruf.
It all begin like every other day before Crusoe came to my island.
Just another day in paradise, every day was the same.
Beautiful turquoise water, blue skies and lots of delicious fruit.
Sounds perfect right?
Boring if you ask me.
How much paradise can a bird take.
I really wanted to get off this island.
Let's see what's been washed up today?
Of course, more of these.
What's this?
This can be promising.
Hey guys, it is lool out time
Hey... be right there.
Hi Rosie, check out these delicious traits.
Gorgeous, just gorgeous.
Just look at all those bugs.
The beetles are the best.
Crunchy on the outside, with a soft gooey center.
Hey, where did it go?
My kind of vermin.
You thief.
Carmello, that wasn't very nice.
Aren't you joining us for a lool out today Mac?
We're all here.
Yeah, I'll be right there, do we really need to lool out every day?
So, what did you bring today?
I'm not sure what it is.
I meant food for the lool out.
Of course he didn't bring anything for the lool out.
This is beautiful.
Hey, guys, guys,
I think I really found something important this time.
Check this out!
Where?
What?
Scrubby, you're really going blind.
Over here!
Smells delicious.
No, no, is not food.
It's proof that there's more to the world than just our island.
Here we go again.
It's true.
Can't we just eat in peace for once.
Sure, no problem, just as long as you can tell me where this came from.
From the water.
I vote for Carmello.
I too vote for Carmello.
I too vote for Carmello.
Oh, come on, this isn't election.
The thing in the bobble is... is...
Is what?
You know what I think, Mac?
That thingy is whatever you want to believe it is.
Exactly.
You are one hopeless dreamer.
Did you forget you almost died of exhaustion.
Flying across the ocean, looking for this other world of yours.
My dear macaw, you must wake up, and smell the papaya.
For this is the world.
I don't care what you guys say, there's a bigger world out there and I intend to find it.

I wanna be mat makers of that green around the gills.
We ain't anchoring to be sharing your lunch with you, lad.
Sorry, I'm not much of a sailor.
You're there right.
If you're fixing the up jock find your way down we.
My hat, don't...
Your poor stomach, you see wait till you get to them strange islands, and you meet your first cannibals.
Cannibals?
We made our choice to go to sea, right, easy old pal?
And I swear, I'll not regret it.
Alright, go and bring me something to eat.
Right May, I wont fail you.
Good day, you lucky clucks will you join me for a little snack?
Come on now.
No need to be shy.
I'll chop you.
What business might you be having above decks?
I was just making sure my chicken food.
Friends.
Were fresh.
No, warm.
Warm and confy.
Get your fur over there.
not!
So, then, where were we?
Knock it off
You cats belong down below, and stay away from our chickens.
That goes for you as well!
Who does that green gill land lover thinks he is?
The huminus, threw us into the haul?
This is our ship wretched as it is, it's home.
Mark my word now, someday, somehow, that canine and his human will pay.
I'm with you there mate, they'll pay alright.
How much exactly we're charging them?
That should teach them to mess with our egg supply, old boy!
Eggs.
Oh, no, not again.
Buck up, boy yo?
Looks like we got one Tuesday of a storm brewing.
So much for a peaceful meal.
Oh, nobody saw that one coming, hang on Carmello!
Perhaps it would be wise to move this far east to the cave.
Let's get moving, this is gonna be a nasty one.
I'm with you on that call.
Hey, Mac, grab the pineapple.
Like we really needed this pineapple.
All hands on deck, and get those sails down.
Hey you self homemade, mister ride up the storm there.
Aynsley!
I got you.
Hey, hey!
Help!
Help!
Look out, flying away pineapple!
Sorry Pango.
Careful Rosie.
I got it!
Scrubby!
Help!
Quick Rosie, the tree!
Easy Scrubby, don't panic.
Ok, I got you now.
Well, come on you old goat, get your hooves moving.
We ain't got all day.
That's it!
Easy.
Don't be afraid.
One step at a time.
Scrubby!
Help!
He's not going to make it, do something!
Carmello, grab him.
I got him.
Help!
Help!
we're in here!
Someone help!
Help!
Away!
Payback time!
I can't hold on Carmello, this is the end little buddy?
There's not much time, they're gonna fall.
Keep steady, I'm coming mates.
Pango, what are you doing?
How's it going mate?
Nice try Pango, but is hopeless, I'm a goner.
Mac!
Hold on!
Hold on!
Come on, come on, come on!
I'll get you guys out of there!
We have to do something!
Mac!
This just went from bad to worse.
Hey, don't worry guys, that branch looks pretty solid to me.
Right, but how do we get down?
You got me there.
Oh, I can't believe it.
They're alive!
It's a miracle.
Hey, anybody wants some pineapple?
Do you hear that sound?
What's out there, Mac?
I have no idea.
Never heard a sound like that before.
Can you see anything?
Not a thing, unfortunately, we're gonna have to wait until morning.
Same old stuff.
Shells and more shells.
Swollen.
Begones.
That's a new taste.
Earthy, with a slight touch of salt.
Come on, come tu papa!
Hey Scrubs, what'd you find?
What is it you're eating?
I don't know, but it's delicious.
Oh, Scrubs.
You don't collect stuff like this.
My nose tells me there's more goodies at that rocky point.
Look at that?
Wooden Ca... terpillars.
See, I was right.
This is the most incredible proof that there's another world out there.
No, look behind you?
What are you talking about, behind me?
I can't believe it.
Is the thing we heard dying last night.
What do you think it is?
The other world.
I have to get a closer look.
Mac don't, we have no idea what it is.
If it's dangerous, Mac?
This is amazing, I was right!
I knew it, I knew it, I knew it!
This is from the other world!
I've never seen anything like this.
Incredible!
Mac should be more careful.
Pango is right!
we should keep our distance.
What's going on?
Easy now, whatever you are.
I just want to talk.
See monsters?
Look at this.
This heart makes me shoot leftings.
Hello!
Is anyone out there?
Hey, can anybody hear me?
Look at it!
Captain?
Bosen?
Anyone?
It's hideous!
Where did they all go.
I can't believe everyone is really gone.
Looks like there's just the two of us.
Let's go to shore.
Hang on Aynsley.
The current is really strong.
Land, sweet land!
Is so good to be alive Aynsley.
Pot your uncle, sea monsters walking on land?
We're in big trouble.
Only one thing has two legs.
A bird!
That ain't no bird I've ever seen.
Yeah, he can't even fly.
That monster is going to eat Carmello.
What's going on Aynsley?
We gotta do something, now!
Hurry, make as much noise as you can.
We have to scare those sea monsters off.
Come back here Aynsley.
Stay close together, we don't know what's out there.
What was that?
Aynsley?
Aynsley what's that noise?
Cannibals!
Aynsley cannibals!
We have to get off this island.
Sailor warned us.
They'll skin us alive and eat us.
Hurry old boy, they're coming for us!
Get inside Aynsley, go boy, go, there.
Guys, guys, guys, what are you doing?
Scaring off the sea monsters, thank you very much.
And what if they aren't sea mosnters.
Did you see the furry one's teeth?
He'll reap us to shreds.
Everybody calm down, we're safe here.
Are we?
We really don't know what those creatures are capable of.
I know one thing they are capable of.
Leaving the island.
What?
Oh, no, come on, this can't be happening to me.
He's actualy leaving.
We did it.
We got rid of him.
Yeah, we scared them big time.
Will somebody tell me what's happening?
I'll tell you what's going on.
You guys have ruined my chance to get off this island and see the world.
You really don't get it, do you?
You think this is paradise, well, it is not.
It meant so much to me.
He's back.
Oh no, here we go again.
Back?
Are you serious?
Let me see.
Here's what we're gonna do, we stay out of sight.
And, we keep an eye on them.
To see what they end up doing, ok?
Ok, then, nobody goes on the beach, that goes for you too Scrubby.
He, yeah, I heard you.
Didn't even get to finish my breakfast.
All of those new smells are driving me crazy.
I gotta go check it out.
Where are you going Scrubby?
Come back!
It's not safe out there.
Can't let all those tasty mussels get washed away.
If I recall correctly didn't Mac say we should all stay out of sight.
He did.
Speaking of which, where is Mac?
Sorry about today old friend, that was a pretty inactive attempt.
What was I thinking?
I haven't the foggiest idea where we are.
All for that matter, the slightest inkling in which direction to set sail.
Someone is bound to come and save us old boy.
I'm sure of it.
If those cannibals come back, we'll be ready for them.
Who's out there?
Show yourselves!
I don't want to tear you to shreds.
And I have a musket.
A goat?
It´s just a goat.
A bird?
Maybe there aren't hunters and cannibals after all.
Mac, what were you doing out there all by yourself?
I thought you said we should stay hidden.
I was just... checking things out, that's all.
What's all the commotion about anyway.
Well, Epi just made a good point.
I just suggested, hypothetically, that possibly the sea monster lost that thing that Mac jiffy found.
And maybe he's come to get it back.
Along with us.
Is one of two things for sure.
A coincidence, or a bad omen.
In a way you need to get rid of it.
Why not just give it back to the sea monsters.
A "G" idea.
No way!
You're kidding!
You're so selfish.
Selfish?
Ok.
Maybe.
Just give me time to think about it.
But if I do give it back, you're all coming with me.
Well.
We're right there Aynsley.
We got some work to do.
Let's save all we can before is all lost to the sea.
How is he looking mate?
They're taking over our beach.
He's pulling strange stuff out from the sea.
I suppose this means they're not leaving anytime soon, then.
Looks that way.
Do you see how the furry one sleeps all day while the big one does the work.
No, but I'll take your word for it.
I bet the sleeping one is the boss.
Look, he stripped off his skin.
I'm going to be sick.
None of us knew it at the time, but we were being watched by the real monsters on the island
Some luck May.
Their green gill human and his manking mock mating safety here.
How are we gonna deal with him, he might be a problem for us.
Don't you worry,
I'll figure out a way to get rid of them quick enough.
For the time being we sit, watch and wait.
Come on May,
I'm starving here.
And cut to what I just say!
Sit, watch and wait.
That's right, now stay focused.
We got the upper claw.
No one knows we're here, which means we take our time.
And we pick them off one by one.
Look Aynsley, this can come in very handy.
I gotta to practice before we venture out there to get our dinner, right boy!

Steady!
What's he doing?
Back your hammer, and.
I don't know about you Scrubby, but I'm planning on stayting as far away from that monster as possible.
What was that all about?
I have absolutely no idea.
What we need to find out, is what these newcomers intentions are,
From the sound of it, they're up to no good
Obviously they're trying to kill us.
Maybe, but maybe not.
The truth of the matter is that these new comers, have brought nothing but trouble to our paradise, that is a fact.
Fine, then do like I ask, and stay out of sight.
They're proof that there's another world out there and I'm going to find out whether they're friend or foe.
You really don't get it, do you?
That was close!
Ok, let's give this a go, one last time.
Did you see that Aynsley!
I did it, I hit the mark!
Let's go fix something to eat, old boy.
That was a miracle, I'd never thought I'd hit it.
Well.
I can hit something after all.
I was starting to wonder if everyone wasn't right, the new world was finally here, and I had no idea if I was ready for it or not.
Tapir's ready as I've ever seen.
Go for the throat, let's make this quick.
Wait, the human!
I can't do it boy.
Go on!
Go!
What now?
Sorry pal.
I've never shot anything before, why don't we try fishing.
What's burning?
That would be me.
You smell like bump biscuits.
Something is coming.
Looks like Rosie was here, that's strange,
Rosie never leaves any food behind.
Would you prefer light or dark meat for lunch, darling?
I prefer...
Dog!
Ready to get even, ratter!
Hold Aynsley, I'm coming, those blasted ratters, they did survive after all.
I'm hit!
Run for it!
Good dog!
You're alright old boy?
Did you I hear that?
Over there!
It's a bird, a beautiful parrot.
Strangely, that's what all the fuss was about.
The ratters went after the bird.
You did good old boy, and you, we're gonna fix you up straight away.
Look Aynsley, a ring!
That can only mean one thing, sailors have sail for this island before.
I believe there's hope for us after all.
You can come out guys, there's no one around.
It's too dark, I can't see a thing.
This is the very spot where that sea monster attack me.
Well, sort of.
I've almost.
We shouldn't have let him go alone.
Maybe he's molting.
That's a bit of a stretch Pango.
Just wait 'till I get my hooves on them!
Anyway you look at it, this is not good.
Mac can't be gone.
What's that?
And who are you two?
Just two homeless castaways, we were held captive by that human for months with nothing to eat but the crumbs from his table.
What about our friend?
Did you see him by any chance?
It's a true tragedy, alright.
An unfortunate turn of events.
You see we caught.
We saw the hosting.
Well, come on, let's hear it.
What are you waiting for?
We'll tell you what happened to your friend.
For I'm warning you, it ain't pretty.
You see, the human loves to eat birds, and I'm afraid your friend got... trapped.
This should only take a minute, It's just dislocated.
But. it's going to hurt, a bit.
Don't worry.
You´ll feel better in a day or two, though you won't be able to fly right away.
Well then, I suppose you'll need name if you're gonna stay here for a while.
Let's see, by my reckoning today is Tuesday, that's a good a name as any, mate.
Can you say, Tuesday.
T u e s d a y
Well, not quite, but that's a start.
Take care of our new friend, boy.
I'd better offload as much stuff as I can.
There's no telling how much the ship will stay in one piece.
They're nothing but cannibals!
Murderers.
I say we run him off our island, drive them monsters back into the sea!
Perhaps a plan might be to force them to live on curse island.
Oh, yes, yes, yes.
Curse Island.
What exactly is Curse Island?
The end of the earth mate, no one's ever made it back from there.
Yeah, there's nothing there but bugs.
Lots and lots of nasty bugs!
Sounds purrrfect, drive them to Curse island.
That's not gonna work.
You have a better idea?
No.
Right, so then, where were we?
Stop your flapping about bird.
You need to be resting that wing of yours.
What do you want from me?
I just want to talk.
Me name is Aynsley, and for what I understand, yours is Tuesday.
Call me whatever you want, except dinner.
Dinner?
We're not going to eat you, we saved your life.
Either way, you don't make much of a meal.
Not like a fat, juicy turkey sweetheart back at home.
What?
Relax.
My master likes you.
You said, your master?
You did not think that I.
I like you, you're funny.
I've never seen a bird like you in England.
England.
Tell me more Aynsley.
Well buddy, England, my island.
Just one fantastic place in a sea of many lands.
I knew it!
Crusoe wants to explore them all.
If we ever get off this one.
You know, you're the first to come from the outside world.
Oh dear, that's not good news.
Hey, hold on a second, we're all dress up like this because?
Because you look fierce, now get your heads in the game everyone.
We have the perfect opportunity, the dog and that bird are still on the ship.
Right.
Listen up!
Here's the plan, we'll deal with the hairy beast on the ship.
The rest of you.
Go for the human on the beach.
What is sheep?
That wooden thing on the beach.
As soon we're on the ship, "the wooden thing".
You attack!
Alright then, fierce, fierce, fierce!
So, I'm a fierce coconut?
But I should go tell my friends that I'm ok.
You better stay put, you're in no condition to fly.
Well, look at this.
We can kill two birds with one stone.
There's two birds now?
Oh, shut it, just follow my lead.
Look, look!
That's him brothers.
He's wearing Mac like a trophy.
That is so wrong!
Attack!
Let's get them.
Aynsley, we gotta go.
What's going on out there.
They've all got mad.
It appears as your friends have come to avenge your death.
I'm not dead!
Oh, we're gonna take care of that right now.
Aynsley!
Help!
Aynsley!
Help!
Come on down there and fight!
Aynsley!
Twist it!
Hold on, that sounded like.
Mac!
Aynsley!
Mac, get out!
Kiki!
Mac!
I'm coming boy!
Rotten cats!
You are to blame for all this!
Gotta leave the ship, mate!
Aynsley!
Go!
What's happening here?
I thought Mac was dead.
We all did, but I don't think he made it this time.
That would be horrible.
Come on guys, we better move back now.
Oh no, Aynsley, what have I done.
Land.
Land!
We're safe mate, I thought we were goners.
Oh, will you just shut up!
What's that noise?
That would be bugs.
Bugs!
Curse Island!
Rest in peace old boy.
Tuesday.
Mac!
Kiki!
Mac, you're hurt!
I'll be ok.
I'm sure glad to see you.
I was worried.
Me too.
Come on, now is your chance to get away
I can't.
Well, let me help you.
No, no, no, I, I just...
I don't, want to get away.
What?
You don't understand, is all those cats fault.
What do you mean.
They attacked me, he fixed my wing.
And his dog gave his life to save me.
I can't leave him now.
Oh, I see.
So, he's going to take care of you?
Look, he's gonna need my help to survive.
I owe him that.
Exactly, how do you plan on doing that?
I mean, look at him.
Tuesday!
Help!
I don't believe it, those cats used us and Mac as well, and what do we do?
We attacked the human.
Hold on, then.
So, what you're saying is Kiki's debrained fault on this.
Oh, fatal.
That's not fair, we all thought Mac was dead.
Didn't we?
Oh, this is not good, mate.
Yeah, we've made a real mess of things.
Looks that way Epi gal.
Where are you going Rosie?
I'm going to clean up our mess.
I'm in!
Let's get cracking then, mate.
Wait a second.
You're going to make an even bigger mess of things.
Wild beasts, they're going to get us!
Stay right where you are.
I've got a special treat for all of you.
I just wanted to give you some biscuits, that's all.
They're quite good.
I finished off your dog human, and I promise one day, you and the rest of your lot will join him.
Now that, is the taste of desperation.
Try to get one, they taste just like chicken.
What, do you want to show me something?
Alright, alright, let's go!
Tuesday.
This, this is fantastic.
Fresh water.
Good job Tuesday.
What?
You want me to follow you?
Okay, I'm coming!
Hey guys, look who's here.
Relax. there's nothing to be afraid of.
Stay right where you are, I'll be right back.
What got into him, why is he running away?
Beats me.
Maybe it's your smell.
Try one of these, it's really good.
And some for you, and try.
So choosy, where's pretty bird.
I haven't see her yet.
Pretty bird.
You don't need to yell Mac, I mean Tuesday.
I'm right here.
Here you have pretty bird.
Here, do you see, I don't hurt you.
Come on, don't be afraid.
Come on pretty bird.
Well, friendships aren't made in a day.
Taking one step at a time, right choosy.
One step.
I can't May, the current is too strong.
So, you failed again, did you?
Would you stop feeling sorry for yourself?
Oh, time will come.
Soon there will be more of us.
Revenge will be sweet.
That hurt.
Ah, you can't see a bloody thing, can you old goat?
We're gonna have to fix that.
There you are.
That should help.
Why Rosie, you're no pig.
Hey, what has gotten into you?
You're gorgeous?
Easy big boy.
No, no.
Oh no.
Tuesday help.
Hey guys!
Nevermind.
This is hopeless.
How am I ever going to survive in this island?
Yes, of course, that's it!
I have to build a tree house!
It's raining tree limbs.
Is good enough to eat.
Is there anything you wouldn't eat?
Hey snail, what's he doing?
Come on mate, he's just bunkers on us.
He's destroying the tree.
I can't saw more.
Need to finish shelter, we must build.
Yes Sir, a whole porridge please.
We had no clue what Crusoe was up to.
Sawing.
Porridge.
Yep, as Pango would say, he was bonkers to the max.
Are you coming along May.
Can I have just a little peak?
Can you just wait, I'm cleaning them up.
Well could you at least tell me how big a litter we have?
More than we'll ever be able to feed, I'm afraid.
You look kittie.
That's smart.
I'm trying to work here, go eat somewhere else.
At this rate, I'll never get this built.
I told you, go!
Ah, nevermind.
What I wouldn't give for an extra set of hands.
For all his pounding and sawing we couldn't figure what he was actually doing.
What is going on?
Really?
I couldn't blame Rosie.
When you got an itch, you gotta scatch it.
The poor Crusoe he didn't see it that way.
He has had enough.
And that's when it hit me, a nest.
Hey, guys.
I've figured out what he was doing.
Making an ass?
No.
His building a shelter.
We don't follow you mate.
He's building a nest.
A nest?
So he is a bird.
Scrubs.
He's building a human nest in the tree.
Pretty clever.
I've never slept in a tree.
If he stocks it with food, you'll sleep in a tree.
Good point, so guys, I got an idea, what do you say we help him out.
Get this nest of his built.
I must've been crazy, thinking I can build all this by my... self.
We didn't really have any idea what we were getting into.
We just figure let's help, use whatever abilities we had and hoped it all worked.
I'll be gobsmacked.
Slowly, slowly.
Slowly, slowly.
That's it, just a little more.
Hi Epi, where are you headed with all that food?
I need a little help here guys.
Not that kind of help.
It tickles.
Epi hold up, I'm starving.
Help.
Things didn't always go smoothly and we had our ups and downs.
That's for sure.
But everyone was in fine spirits and Crusoe seemed.
Well, happy.
He made a funny little door for Epi and Pango to get into the nest.
It was a pretty good idea.
After a few modifications that is.
We became a real team, playing all these funny games Crusoe came up with.
He had all sorts of crazy ideas oh, and hide and seek in the ground.
Crusoe had a funny way of eating, he peeled the fruit.
And boy did he eat slow.
It took quite a while but despite his ackwardness and all of his flaws
Crusoe surprised even the most skeptical among us.
That's it, that's it, watch your step.
I've just put the finishing touches on our new home.
New home, hold it right there, first thing we must do is christen the place.
It's good luck you know.
I christen thee.
Oh, nevermind.
The preach is for us.
Now look at that.
It's so beautiful.
Hip, hip, hooray!
What in the world is that noise he's making?
Sounds like Scrubby when he needs food.
It's painful mate, let's get out of here.
Personally, I think it sounds beautiful.
A party and we weren't invited.
Now, could you come here.
I'm starving here.
Coming.
You know how difficult it is in my condition to hunt right now.
Have you tried to make it to the other island lately.
Oh May, you know the last time I'd tried I almost drowned.
I'm afraid we're just stuck with just the bugs and spiders.
They sound delicious.
Now go and hunt some up for me!
Right, darling.
I'll wrap them in seeweed just the way you like them.
With the nest completed, Crusoe moved on to a new project.
We didn't have to forage for food, we had this great nest and we even had indoor plumbing.
Paradise, just got better.
That human sure has made life peachy for us.
Rosie is sponsor to the max,
I tell ye old girl, if this new world talks about this cuchie, it might not be that bad after all.
Getting a little plump aren't we, sitting around all day?
Ain't nothing wrong with a few curves, Kiki honey.
With Crusoe doing the fishing, it would put the superb in you too in no time, Kiki.
What do we have here?
Looks like Crusoe is going to put your fish and scales to shame, Kiki.
As time passed, life became more and more confortable for us all.
Yet, Crusoe seemed very sad at times, he missed his old world.
He build a strange tower on the highest point of the island.
With bright lights burning every night.
Another day and no ship in sight little fellow.
What I wouldn't give to see the sun set over the Thames.
Thames?
Come on partner.
I don't get it, why does he light this thing every night?
In the hope that some other humans pass by.
If they see the signal, they'll come and rescue him.
I knew the chances of leaving this island, would become slimmer as time went by.
I just didn't know how slim.
More humans on the island, that's not gonna happen.
And now my friends, like all good Englishman, a moment of silence.
To give thanks for this bountiful harvest.
Mind your manners.
Our host is...
Taking a snooze at the peers.
Ye he, he, or worse.
Hey, stop fooling around.
At least we're not out in that weather.
It's miserable out there.
Listen you guys, we're meant to live in the weather, have you'all gone soft.
Kiki, why get so worked up?
You haven's seen worked up, answer me this.
What happens to us when Crusoe leaves this island?
Have you thought of that.
Kiki, now, now, listen!
I'm listening!
I'm listening loud and clear, Mac!
Shall we eat!
If I could just find me some mussels!
One miscel little mussel.
It's mine, It's all mine, mine, mine, mine.
What´s yours!
Nothing.
You wouldn't be depriving your family!
Now, would you sweetheart?
Yes.
I mean no.
Come here!
Oh May, that hurts.
Shame on you.
Look, the ship is falling apart.
Our luck is turning, we'll be able to make it back to the main island after all.
Hey, let's say we go outside and have some fun on the water slide.
Great idea, I love all the smells after a good rain.
I'll catch with you guys later,
I better find Kiki first, make sure she's alright.
Why didn't that ship just vanish into the sea.
Our lives are never going to be the same again.
Show me that snack before we move on to the main island.
No!
Scream all you want little bird.
No one is coming to save you now.
I'll be the son of a seacook!
Watch out children, is the human!
Get your filthy paws off my bird.
To the left!
We have to get out of here quick!
Come on everyone!
We've got them surrounded!
Attack!
kaboom!
Oh no!
He got me!
If this is heaven?
Why are you here?
They're heading for the big island.
They're everywhere!
It's all my fault.
We have to warn the others!
Get to the nest, now!
Hurry!
Predators!
What?
Did he say predators?
No.
Hang on everyone, I'll get my musket.
Batten down the hatches!
Batten down the hatches!
Weapons!
Gun powder!
Buckshot.
That's it juicy!
Close the
They're everwhere!
Get off of me!
You bloody blasterds!
Help!
Get me down from here!
I may not know humans, but they tend to be very angry.
Carmello!
Crusoe needs our help.
Look out!
Hurry Epi!
Pango, over here!
Jump!
Stand back Epi!
Hurry!
He's right behind you!
Go!
go!
I need my musket!
Look what you've done.
You guys stay put!
Oh not again!
Stay away you mange cats!
Hang on Crusoe!
Good job buddy.
Wasn't so bad!
Keep puching!
I'll take care of these.
Pango!
Is awful high!
Come on, you can make it.
Jump!
Oh my here, here it goes!
Good work!
Now, let's get out of here!
Ok!
So long, furrball!
Hungry hour, well then take that!
Hakawa, Matata, banana!
So long!
Scrubby, the door!
Come on!
Hello there!
Very glad Scrubs!
Over here, Epi!
Hide in the bucket!
Going up!
Get off!
Get off!
Get off, you mengie cat!
Good Work, Epi!
They'll never get me!
We got rid of them, didn't we?
Epi!
Pango!
Help me!
Look up behind you, Epi!
Let go of me!
The cats are trying to get in through the hatch!
No.
Rosie no, that was Crusoe!
Let me get this open.
I hope you didn't hurt him.
Everybody ok?
Everybody except Crusoe.
Come on guys, all together, is heavy.
Spread out Rosie, we need all the muscle we can mass bulk.
Really?
Ok, ok.
One, two, three!
That's a bit of a bummer mate.
We need Crusoe, how's he doing Kiki?
He's alive, but he wont be of any use to us.
We're gonna need a miracle to hold on these cats back!
Got it, the musket.
Watch out guys, it's gonna be noisy.
Are you sure that's a good idea?
Is worth the try, what else can we do?
This is going to be easier than I thought.
The human's house, time to make our move.
Hurry, we can't hold them off much longer.
He always pulls that thing to the back first.
Ok, get ready.
That's weird.
What's happening in there?
Hey Tuesday, maybe this thing has something to do with it.
What thing?
Now what?
You know they're gonna come back.
Maybe Crusoe may come to and save us.
I hate to break it to you guys, we're on our own.
We have to get out of here.
Hide in some place.
What about Crusoe?
Pango's right, we can't leave him here.
Guys, guys, it may not be perfect.
But I think I got a plan.
Well you better lay it out cause we're out of time.
Alright children, calm down.
They just got lucky this time, we're gonna sneak up on them and make them pay.
Now let's show them what we're made of.
Oh, yeah.
You got a broken wing, have you?
Don't worry, we'll put you out of your misery.
Stay back, or I'll shoot!
Not so brave now, are you?
Appears your luck has just run out.
You'll have to be quicker than that, ratter.
Get him, he can't fly!
That should take care of you quite nicely.
Sweet dreams from your favorite ratter.
Get ready!
We gotthem cornered May.
Then let's finish him off once and for all.
Catch me if you can, ratter!
Hold on.
Rosie stop, we have to wait for the signal.
This is it, give it all you have Rosie.
What's going on?
They tricked us.
Hold on to your fangs.
We're not so cocky anymore.
Are we?
Tuesday is in trouble.
That was a bossus plan you had there mate!
Couldn't have done it without you guys!
The fire!
Crusoe!
Crusoe!
Over here!
That must've really hurt.
We boat Crusoe out to safety unconscious, but alive.
And then out of the blue, we get cannon blasted from your ship.
The captain can be one tough bloke.
Expect!
They're pirates after all.
Pirates?
You know, like them nasty ratchets only worse.
A pack of crazed cats in my right,
I was sure I was a goner.
I took my musket in one hand, my sword in the other, and carved a swat to the savage hordes.
It was horrible captain.
That is the most fantastical yarn I've heard in all me life.
This is no yarn, captain?
So ye say, well then, just trying to set sail, you and your bird can take a bunk below.
Oh, Captain, I cannot tell you how I love to see England again.
England!
We'll not be sailing from them ports, unless you want me to be hanging from the gallows.
Right dreamer.
But you see, me...
I must...
Can you at least drop me from a bit closer to home.
You're with us now.
Once a pirate, always a pirate.
Have you got a problem with that?
But Captain, if I might.
Enough talk!
Off with ya!
Then I'll be expecting you in the carrier you lad, or you will be walking the plank you will or worse.
Look!
Is it a mirage May?
It's not another mirage you idiot.
It's a ship, children start paddling.
♪ I ply my trade from the Union Jack!
♪
♪ Upon the seven seas ♪
♪ Unless I eat some rancid. ♪
Hey, give me here, is my rum you're be drinking!
Oh!
you want some rum!
do ya?
How's me fisting ye instead.
These are some nasty pirates, but it wont end well if I stay another moment.
Hey, what you be fixing to do that?
Oh, nothing, nothing at all.
Is that right?
The ingrate we dawn rescue from the island is trying to steal one of our rowboats.
If pretty boy is going to be stealing anything, I'd be us!
No, I was just...
Hey, what's going on out here?
Bosun, he's trying to jump ship!
Get him in throne little prick.
Alright, let's teach him a lesson, take that.
He's getting away!
Grab him!
Give me a piece of him!
There's no way out of this ship you fool!
Get him!
He's mine!
I'm ready!
A raft!
Ye fools, shooting the wrong side of the man, come on men.
Show me what are ye be made of.
Bosun!
Get your scurby excuse for a pirate down to my cabin, now!
Aye, aye, Captain, right away!
And the rest of ye fools!
Back to work, before I give each ten lashes of me whip.
Disgusting bird!
He's getting away!
Shall we send some men after him?
Neh, let him go.
Oh, Captain, can't we fire a cannon short blowthem his misery!
Why waste a good cannonball, let'm spend the rest of his life on that long forgotten island.
That is if a wild beast doesn´t get him first.
Aye, aye, Captain!
It's been noice nawing ya Ruf.
We did ourselves a good run man, didn't we Cec.
Jump!
I wasn't going to let those ratters get ya, we friends gotta stick together.
Nice for you to think so.
Where are we heading off to then?
We're going home!
THE WILD LIFE
Oh, disc it.
Task it a biscuit, Hold Dr. Ceci.
Stop your plan it.
Almost.
There.
We'll be shadow puppets.
Why haven't got me breakfast yet, either?
Catou!
Shadow puppets?
Seriously mate.
You are one kidney short of a meat pie.
I was..
Give me.
Go!
Get off of me, you good for nothing feline, Catou!
Say you can't even get a nice sleep without some fleery, limey?
Signal fire off the starboard bow!
Signal fire!
Starboard bow!
Captain, captain!
Wake up!
You waky, waky!
Attack!
Board the ship!
Here, swashbucklirus, and what is it!
Bosun, is you?
Sorry to wake you, captain.
But there's a signal fire on the small Island off the starboard side.
What course of action shall we be taking.
Let me have a look.
Some sort of house on fire.
What's this?
Fire abroad side!
Drive those bloody beasts off.
Aye, aye, Captain!
Then go and bring back whoever he is.
And Bosun, make sure they leave nothing behind of any value.
Will do, captain.
Humans?
What you go by fellow?
Crusoe, Robinson Crusoe.
Looks like them wild beasts nearly had you for dinner.
Lucky we found you when we did.
- Oh, they are my--
- Hold on a second mate.
Let's have a look in there.
Not a single gold tooth in his head.
- Pity.
- Pirates!
Hey, ye've been one lucky bloke.
Crusoe, isn't?
I'm in your debt, Captain.
Ney!
Plus me eagle eye night watch then saved yer hide.
Well, let me tell ye, blasterd bird!
- No Captain, he's with me.
- No Captain.
He's with me.
A talking parrot.
What skull duggery is this?
Trying to talk yerself, did ya?
Yes captain.
Drink up, that'll start yer stump smith.
Now, tell me more about this island of yarn.
Is there anything of... shall we say...
value on it?
All I can say is that--
I was shipwrecked, marooned.
Fending for myself with nothing but time and very few skills to survive.
Sorry about that.
I see the bird has taught ye how to drink as well.
That's not very polite, Tuesday you'll have to wait outside, I'm afraid.
"Fending for myself?"
Really?
Listen.
You two wanna hear the true tale of Robinson Crusoe?
Of sure, we're all ears or at least Cecil here is.
Hey, come on, Ruf.
It all begin like every other day before Crusoe came to my island.
Just another day in paradise every day was the same.
Beautiful turquoise water blue skies and lots of delicious fruit.
Sounds perfect, right?
Boring if you ask me.
How much paradise can a bird take?
I really wanted to get off this island.
Let's see what's been washed up today?
Of course, more of these.
What's this?
This can be promising.
Hey guys, it is lool out time.
Hey... be right there.
Hi Rosie, check out these delicious traits.
Gorgeous, just gorgeous.
Just look at all those bugs.
The beetles are the best.
Crunchy on the outside, with a soft gooey center.
Hey, where did it go?
- My kind of vermin.
- You thief.
Carmello, that wasn't very nice.
Aren't you joining us for a lool out today, Mac?
We're all here.
Yeah, I'll be right there...
Do we really need to lool out every day?
So, what did you bring today?
I'm not sure what it is.
I meant food for the lool out.
Of course he didn't bring anything for the lool out.
This is beautiful.
Hey, guys, guys...
I think I really found something important this time.
Check this out!
Where?
What?
Scrubby, you're really going blind.
Over here!
Smells delicious.
No, no, is not food.
It's proof that there's more to the world than just our island.
Here we go again.
It's true.
Can't we just eat in peace for once.
Sure, no problem just as long as you can tell me where this came from.
From the water.
I vote for Carmello.
I too vote for Carmello.
I too vote for Carmello.
Oh, come on, this isn't election.
The thing in the bobble is... is...
Is what?
You know what I think, Mac?
That thingy is whatever you want to believe it is.
- Exactly.
- You are one hopeless dreamer.
Did you forget you almost died of exhaustion.
Flying across the ocean, looking for this other world of yours.
My dear macaw, you must wake up and smell the papaya.
For this is the world.
I don't care what you guys say... there's a bigger world out there and I intend to find it.
♪ I ply my trade from the Union Jack!
♪
♪ Upon the seven seas ♪
♪ And unless I eat some rancid meat ♪
♪ Bury me soul where the mermaid please ♪
Look that we have.
I wanna be mat makers of that green around the gills.
We ain't anchoring to be sharing your lunch with you, lad.
Sorry, I'm not much of a sailor.
You're there right.
If you're fixing the up jock find your way down we.
My hat, don't--
Your poor stomach you see wait till you get to them strange islands and you meet your first cannibals.
Cannibals?
We made our choice to go to sea, right, easy old pal?
And I swear, I'll not regret it.
Alright, go and bring me something to eat.
Right May, I wont fail you.
Good day, you lucky clucks will you join me for a little snack?
Come on now.
No need to be shy.
I'll chop you.
What business might you be having above decks?
I was just making sure my chicken food.
Friends.
Were fresh.
No, warm.
Warm and confy.
Get your fur over there.
Not!
So, then, where were we?
Knock it off.
You cats belong down below, and stay away from our chickens.
That goes for you as well!
Who does that green gill land lover thinks he is?
The huminus, threw us into the haul?
This is our ship wretched as it is, it's home.
Mark my word now, someday, somehow that canine and his human will pay.
I'm with you there mate, they'll pay alright.
How much exactly we're charging them?
That should teach them to mess with our egg supply, old boy!
Eggs.
Oh, no, not again.
Buck up, boy yo?
Looks like we got one Tuesday of a storm brewing.
So much for a peaceful meal.
Oh, nobody saw that one coming, hang on Carmello!
Perhaps it would be wise to move this far east to the cave.
Let's get moving, this is gonna be a nasty one.
I'm with you on that call.
Hey, Mac, grab the pineapple.
Like we really needed this pineapple.
All hands on deck, and get those sails down.
Hey you self homemade, mister ride up the storm there.
Aynsley!
I got you.
Hey, hey!
Help!
Help!
Look out, flying away pineapple!
Sorry Pango.
Careful Rosie.
I got it!
Scrubby!
Help!
Quick Rosie, the tree!
Easy Scrubby, don't panic.
Ok, I got you now.
Well, come on you old goat, get your hooves moving.
We ain't got all day.
That's it!
Easy.
Don't be afraid.
One step at a time.
- Scrubby!
- Help!
He's not going to make it, do something!
Carmello, grab him.
I got him...
Help!
Help!
we're in here!
Someone help!
Help!
No, no!
Away!
Payback time!
I can't hold on Carmello, this is the end little buddy?
There's not much time, they're gonna fall.
Keep steady, I'm coming mates.
Pango, what are you doing?
How's it going mate?
Nice try Pango, but is hopeless, I'm a goner.
Mac!
Hold on!
Hold on!
Come on, come on, come on!
I'll get you guys out of there!
We have to do something!
Oh, no!
Mac!
This just went from bad to worse.
Hey, don't worry guys, that branch looks pretty solid to me.
Right, but how do we get down?
You got me there.
Oh, I can't believe it.
They're alive!
It's a miracle.
Hey, anybody wants some pineapple?
Do you hear that sound?
- What's out there, Mac?
- I have no idea.
Never heard a sound like that before.
Can you see anything?
Not a thing unfortunately, we're gonna have to wait until morning.
Same old stuff.
Shells and more shells.
Swollen.
Begones.
That's a new taste.
Earthy, with a slight touch of salt.
Come on, come tu papa!
Hey Scrubs, what'd you find?
What is it you're eating?
I don't know, but it's delicious.
Oh, Scrubs.
You don't collect stuff like this.
My nose tells me there's more goodies at that rocky point.
Look at that?
Wooden Ca... terpillars.
See, I was right.
This is the most incredible proof that there's another world out there.
No, look behind you?
What are you talking about, behind me?
I can't believe it.
Is the thing we heard dying last night.
What do you think it is?
The other world.
- I have to get a closer look.
- Mac don't, we have no idea what it is.
If it's dangerous, Mac?
This is amazing, I was right!
I knew it, I knew it, I knew it!
This is from the other world!
I've never seen anything like this.
Incredible!
Mac should be more careful.
Pango is right!
We should keep our distance.
What...
What's going on?
Easy now, whatever you are.
I just want to talk.
See monsters?
Wow.
Look at this.
This heart makes me shoot leftings.
Hello!
Is anyone out there?
Hey, can anybody hear me?
Look at it!
Captain?
Bosun?
Anyone?
It's... hideous!
Where did they all go.
I can't believe everyone is really gone.
Looks like there's just the two of us.
Let's go to shore.
Hang on Aynsley.
The current is really strong.
Land, sweet land!
Is so good to be alive, Aynsley.
Pot your uncle, sea monsters walking on land?
We're in big trouble.
Only one thing has two legs.
A bird!
That ain't no bird I've ever seen.
Yeah, he can't even fly.
That monster is going to eat Carmello.
What's going on, Aynsley?
We gotta do something, now!
Hurry, make as much noise as you can.
We have to scare those sea monsters off.
Come back here, Aynsley.
Stay close together, we don't know what's out there.
What was that?
Aynsley?
Aynsley what's that noise?
Cannibals!
Aynsley cannibals!
We have to get off this island.
Sailor warned us.
They'll skin us alive and eat us.
Hurry old boy, they're coming for us!
Get inside Aynsley, go boy, go, there.
Guys, guys, guys, what are you doing?
Scaring off the sea monsters, thank you very much.
And what if they aren't sea mosnters.
Did you see the furry one's teeth?
He'll reap us to shreds.
- Everybody calm down, we're safe here.
- Are we?
We really don't know what those creatures are capable of.
I know one thing they are capable of.
Leaving the island.
What?
Oh, no, come on, this can't be happening to me.
He's actualy leaving.
We did it.
We got rid of him.
Yeah, we scared them big time.
Will somebody tell me what's happening?
I'll tell you what's going on.
You guys have ruined my chance to get off this island and see the world.
You really don't get it, do you?
You think this is paradise, well, it is not.
It meant so much to me.
He's back.
Oh no, here we go again.
Back?
Are you serious?
Let me see.
Here's what we're gonna do, we stay out of sight.
And, we keep an eye on them.
To see what they end up doing, ok?
Ok, then, nobody goes on the beach... that goes for you too Scrubby.
Yeah, yeah, I heard you.
Didn't even get to finish my breakfast.
All of those new smells are driving me crazy.
I gotta go check it out.
Where are you going, Scrubby?
Come back!
It's not safe out there.
Can't let all those tasty mussels get washed away.
If I recall correctly didn't Mac say we should all stay out of sight.
He did.
Speaking of which, where is Mac?
Sorry about today, old friend, that was a pretty inactive attempt.
What was I thinking?
I haven't the foggiest idea where we are.
All for that matter the slightest inkling in which direction to set sail.
Someone is bound to come and save us, old boy.
I'm sure of it.
If those cannibals come back, we'll be ready for them.
Who's out there?
Show yourselves!
I don't want to tear you to shreds.
And I have a musket.
A goat?
It´s just a goat.
A bird?
Maybe there aren't hunters and cannibals after all.
Mac, what were you doing out there all by yourself?
I thought you said we should stay hidden.
I was just checking things out, that's all.
What's all the commotion about anyway.
Well, Epi just made a good point.
I just suggested, hypothetically that possibly the sea monster lost that thing that Mac jiffy found.
- And maybe he's come to get it back.
- Along with us.
Is one of two things for sure.
A coincidence, or a bad omen.
In a way, you need to get rid of it.
Why not just give it back to the sea monsters.
- A "G" idea.
- No way!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa...
- You're kidding!
- You're so selfish.
- Selfish?
Ok.
Maybe.
Just give me time to think about it.
But if I do give it back you're all coming with me.
Well.
We're right there, Aynsley.
We got some work to do.
Let's save all we can before is all lost to the sea.
How is he looking, mate?
They're taking over our beach.
He's pulling strange stuff out from the sea.
I suppose this means they're not leaving anytime soon, then.
Looks that way.
Do you see how the furry one sleeps all day while the big one does the work?
No, but I'll take your word for it.
I bet the sleeping one is the boss.
Look, he stripped off his skin.
I'm going to be sick.
None of us knew it at the time, but we were being watched by the real monsters on the island.
Some luck, May.
Their green gill human and his manking mock mating safety here.
How are we gonna deal with him he might be a problem for us.
Don't you worry...
I'll figure out a way to get rid of them quick enough.
For the time being we sit watch and wait.
Come on, May...
I'm starving here.
And cut to what I just say!
Sit... watch... and wait.
That's right, now stay focused.
We got the upper claw.
No one knows we're here... which means we take our time.
And we pick them off one by one.
Look, Aynsley...
this can come in very handy.
I gotta to practice before we venture out there to get our dinner, right boy?
♪ I ply my trade from the Union Jack!
♪
♪ Upon the seven seas ♪
♪ Unless I eat some rancid meat ♪
♪ Bury me soul where the mermaid please ♪
Steady!
What's he doing?
Back your hammer, and...
I don't know about you, Scrubby but I'm planning on stayting as far away from that monster as possible.
What was that all about?
I have absolutely no idea.
What we need to find out, is what these newcomers intentions are.
From the sound of it, they're up to no good.
- Obviously they're trying to kill us.
- Maybe, but maybe not.
The truth of the matter is that these new comers have brought nothing but trouble to our paradise that is a fact.
Fine, then do like I ask, and stay out of sight.
They're proof that there's another world out there and I'm going to find out whether they're friend or foe.
You really don't get it, do you?
That was close!
Ok, let's give this a go, one last time.
Did you see that, Aynsley?
!
I did it, I hit the mark!
Let's go fix something to eat, old boy.
That was a miracle, I'd never thought I'd hit it.
Well.
I can hit something after all.
I was starting to wonder if everyone wasn't right the new world was finally here... and I had no idea if I was ready for it or not.
Tapir's ready as I've ever seen.
Go for the throat, let's make this quick.
Wait, the human!
I can't do it, boy.
Go on!
Go!
What now?
Sorry, pal.
I've never shot anything before, why don't we try fishing.
What's burning?
That would be me.
You smell like bump biscuits.
Something is coming.
Looks like Rosie was here, that's strange...
Rosie never leaves any food behind.
Would you prefer light or dark meat for lunch, darling?
I prefer...
Dog!
Ready to get even, ratter!
Hold, Aynsley, I'm coming those blasted ratters, they did survive after all.
I'm hit!
Run for it!
Good dog!
You're alright, old boy?
Did you I hear that?
Over there!
It's a bird, a beautiful parrot.
Strangely, that's what all the fuss was about.
The ratters went after the bird.
You did good, old boy, and you, we're gonna fix you up straight away.
Look, Aynsley, a ring!
That can only mean one thing...
Sailors have sail for this island before.
I believe there's hope for us after all.
You can come out guys, there's no one around.
It's too dark, I can't see a thing.
This is the very spot where that sea monster attack me.
Well, sort of.
I've almost.
We shouldn't have let him go alone.
Maybe he's molting.
That's a bit of a stretch, Pango.
Just wait 'till I get my hooves on them!
Anyway you look at it, this is not good.
Mac can't be gone.
What's that?
And who are you two?
Just two homeless castaways we were held captive by that human for months with nothing to eat but the crumbs from his table.
What about our friend?
Did you see him by any chance?
It's a true tragedy, alright.
An unfortunate turn of events.
You see, we caught--
We saw the hosting.
Well, come on, let's hear it.
What are you waiting for?
We'll tell you what happened to your friend.
For I'm warning you, it ain't pretty.
You see, the human loves to eat birds and I'm afraid your friend got trapped.
This should only take a minute, It's just dislocated.
But, it's going to hurt, a bit.
Don't worry.
You´ll feel better in a day or two, though you won't be able to fly right away.
Well then, I suppose you'll need name if you're gonna stay here for a while.
Let's see, by my reckoning today is Tuesday that's a good a name as any, mate.
Can you say, Tuesday.
Tuesday.
Well, not quite, but that's a start.
Take care of our new friend, boy.
I'd better offload as much stuff as I can.
There's no telling how much the ship will stay in one piece.
- They're nothing but cannibals!
- Murderers.
I say we run him off our island drive them monsters back into the sea!
Perhaps a plan might be to force them to live on curse island.
Yes!
Oh, yes, yes, yes.
Curse Island.
What exactly is Curse Island?
The end of the earth, mate no one's ever made it back from there.
Yeah, there's nothing there but bugs.
Lots and lots of nasty bugs!
Sounds perfect... drive them to Curse island.
That's not gonna work.
You have a better idea?
No.
Right.
So then, where were we?
Stop your flapping about, bird.
You need to be resting that wing of yours.
What do you want from me?
I just want to talk.
Me name is Aynsley and for what I understand, yours is Tuesday.
Call me whatever you want, except dinner.
Dinner?
We're not going to eat you, we saved your life.
Either way, you don't make much of a meal.
Not like a fat, juicy turkey sweetheart back at home.
What?
Relax.
My master likes you.
You said, your master?
You did not think that I...
I like you, you're funny.
I've never seen a bird like you in England.
England.
Tell me more, Aynsley.
Well, buddy.
England, my island.
Just one fantastic place in a sea of many lands.
I knew it!
Crusoe wants to explore them all.
If we ever get off this one.
You know, you're the first to come from the outside world.
Oh, dear that's not good news.
Hey, hold on a second, we're all dress up like this because...?
Because you look fierce now get your heads in the game everyone.
We have the perfect opportunity, the dog and that bird are still on the ship.
Right.
Listen up!
Here's the plan we'll deal with the hairy beast on the ship.
The rest of you.
Go for the human on the beach.
What is ship?
That wooden thing on the beach.
As soon we're on the ship, "the wooden thing"...
- You attack!
- Alright then, fierce, fierce, fierce!
So, I'm a fierce coconut?
But I should go tell my friends that I'm ok.
You better stay put, you're in no condition to fly.
Well, look at this.
We can kill two birds with one stone.
There's two birds now?
No, shut it!
Just follow my lead.
Look, look!
That's him, brothers.
He's wearing Mac like a trophy.
That is so wrong!
Attack!
Let's get them.
Aynsley, we gotta go.
What's going on out there.
They've all got mad.
It appears as your friends have come to avenge your death.
I'm not dead!
Oh, we're gonna take care of that right now.
Aynsley!
Help!
I relieve you!
Aynsley!
Help!
Come on, down there and fight!
Aynsley!
Tuesday...!
- Hold on, that sounded like...
- Mac!
Aynsley!
- Mac, get out!
- Kiki!
Mac!
I'm coming, boy!
Rotten cats!
You are to blame for all this!
Gotta leave the ship, mate!
Go!
- Aynsley!
- Go!
What's happening here?
I thought Mac was dead.
We all did, but I don't think he made it this time.
That would be horrible.
Come on, guys, we better move back now.
Oh, no!
Aynsley, what have I done.
Land.
Land!
We're safe, mate, I thought we were goners.
Oh, will you just shut up!
- What's that noise?
- That would be bugs.
- Bugs!
- Curse Island!
Rest in peace, old boy.
Tuesday.
Mac!
Kiki!
Mac, you're hurt!
I'll be ok.
I'm sure glad to see you.
- I was worried.
- Me too.
Come on, now is your chance to get away.
- I can't.
- Well, let me help you.
No, no, I...
I just...
I don't... want to get away.
What?
You don't understand, is all those cats fault.
- What do you mean.
- They attacked me, he fixed my wing.
And his dog gave his life to save me.
I can't leave him now.
Oh, I see.
So, he's going to take care of you?
Look, he's gonna need my help to survive.
I owe him that.
Exactly, how do you plan on doing that?
I mean, look at him.
Tuesday!
Help!
I don't believe it those cats used us and Mac as well and what do we do?
We attacked the human.
Hold on, then.
So, what you're saying is Kiki's debrained fault on this?
Oh, fatal.
That's not fair, we all thought Mac was dead.
Didn't we?
Oh, this is not good, mate.
Yeah, we've made a real mess of things.
Looks that way, Epi gal.
Where are you going, Rosie?
I'm going to clean up our mess.
- I'm in!
- Let's get cracking then, mate.
Wait a second.
You're going to make an even bigger mess of things.
Wild beasts, they're going to get us!
Stay right where you are.
I've got a special treat for all of you.
I just wanted to give you some biscuits, that's all.
They're quite good.
I finished off your dog, human and I promise one day you and the rest of your lot will join him.
Now that, is the taste of desperation.
Try to get one, they taste just like chicken.
What, do you want to show me something?
Alright.
Alright, let's go!
Tuesday.
This... is fantastic.
Fresh water.
Good job, Tuesday.
What?
You want me to follow you?
Okay, I'm coming!
Hey guys, look who's here.
Relax, there's nothing to be afraid of.
Stay right where you are, I'll be right back.
What got into him, why is he running away?
- Beats me.
- Maybe it's your smell.
Try one of these, it's really good.
And some for you, enjoy.
So Tuesday, where's pretty bird.
- I haven't see her yet.
- Pretty bird.
You don't need to yell, Mac, I mean, Tuesday.
- I'm right here.
- Here you have pretty bird.
Here, do you see, I don't hurt you.
Come on, don't be afraid.
Come on, pretty bird.
Well, friendships aren't made in a day.
Taking one step at a time, right, Tuesday?
One step.
I can't, May, the current is too strong.
So, you failed again, did you?
Would you stop feeling sorry for yourself?
Oh, time will come.
Soon there will be more of us.
Revenge will be sweet.
That hurt.
Ah, you can't see a bloody thing, can you, old goat?
We're gonna have to fix that.
There you are.
That should help.
Why, Rosie, you're no pig.
Hey, what has gotten into you?
You're gorgeous?
Easy, big boy.
No, no, no, no, no.
Oh, no.
No!
Oh no.
Tuesday, help.
Hey, guys!
Nevermind.
This is hopeless.
How am I ever going to survive in this island?
Yes, of course, that's it!
I have to build a tree house!
It's raining tree limbs.
Is good enough to eat.
Is there anything you wouldn't eat?
Hey snail, what's he doing?
Come on, mate, he's just bunkers on us.
He's destroying the tree.
I can't saw more.
Need to finish shelter, we must build.
Yes Sir, a whole porridge please.
We had no clue what Crusoe was up to.
Sawing.
Porridge.
Yep, as Pango would say, he was bonkers to the max.
Are you coming along, May.
Can I have just a little peak?
Can you just wait, I'm cleaning them up!
Well, could you at least tell me how big a litter we have?
More than we'll ever be able to feed, I'm afraid.
You look kittie.
That's smart.
I'm trying to work here, go eat somewhere else.
At this rate, I'll never get this built.
I told you, go!
Ah, nevermind.
What I wouldn't give for an extra set of hands.
For all his pounding and sawing we couldn't figure what he was actually doing.
What is going on?
- Really?
- I couldn't blame Rosie.
When you got an itch, you gotta scatch it.
The poor Crusoe he didn't see it that way.
He has had enough.
And that's when it hit me, a nest!
Hey, guys.
I've figured out what he was doing.
Making an ass?
No.
His building a shelter.
- We don't follow you, mate.
- He's building a nest.
- A nest?
- So he is a bird.
Scrubs.
He's building a human nest in the tree.
Pretty clever.
I've never slept in a tree.
If he stocks it with food, you'll sleep in a tree.
Good point, so guys, I got an idea...
What do you say we help him out.
Get this nest of his built.
I must've been crazy, thinking I can build all this by my self.
We didn't really have any idea what we were getting into.
We just figure let's help use whatever abilities we had and hoped it all worked.
I'll be gobsmacked.
Slowly, slowly.
Slowly, slowly.
That's it, just a little more.
Hi Epi, where are you headed with all that food?
I need a little help here, guys.
It tickles.
Not that kind of help.
No, no.
It tickles.
Epi, hold up, I'm starving!
Help!
Things didn't always go smoothly and we had our ups and downs.
That's for sure.
But everyone was in fine spirits and Crusoe seemed.
Well, happy.
He made a funny little door for Epi and Pango to get into the nest.
It was a pretty good idea.
After a few modifications that is.
We became a real team playing all these funny games Crusoe came up with.
He had all sorts of crazy ideas, oh, and hide and seek in the ground.
Crusoe had a funny way of eating, he peeled the fruit.
And boy did he eat slow.
It took quite a while but despite his ackwardness and all of his flaws Crusoe surprised even the most skeptical among us.
That's it, that's it, watch your step.
I've just put the finishing touches on our new home.
- New home.
- Hold it right there.
First thing we must do is christen the place.
It's good luck, you know.
I christen thee.
Oh, nevermind.
The preach is for us.
Wow!
Now look at that.
It's so beautiful.
Hip, hip, hooray!
What in the world is that noise he's making?
Sounds like Scrubby when he needs food.
It's painful, mate, let's get out of here.
Personally, I think it sounds beautiful.
A party and we weren't invited.
Now, could you come here?
I'm starving here!
Coming.
You know how difficult it is in my condition to hunt right now.
Have you tried to make it to the other island lately?
Oh May, you know the last time I'd tried I almost drowned!
I'm afraid we're just stuck with just the bugs and spiders.
They sound delicious.
Now go and hunt some up for me!
Right, darling.
I'll wrap them in seaweed just the way you like them.
With the nest completed, Crusoe moved on to a new project.
We didn't have to forage for food, we had this great nest and we even had indoor plumbing.
Paradise, just got better.
That human sure has made life peachy for us.
Rosie is sponsor to the max, I tell ye, old girl if this new world talks about this cookie it might not be that bad after all.
Getting a little plump, aren't we, sitting around all day?
Ain't nothing wrong with a few curves, Kiki honey.
With Crusoe doing the fishing... it would put the superb in you too in no time, Kiki.
What do we have here?
Looks like Crusoe is going to put your fish and scales to shame, Kiki.
As time passed, life became more and more confortable for us all.
Yet, Crusoe seemed very sad at times, he missed his old world.
He build a strange tower on the highest point of the island.
With bright lights burning every night.
Another day and no ship in sight, little fellow.
What I wouldn't give to see the sun set over the Thames.
Thames?
Come on, partner.
I don't get it...
Why does he light this thing every night?
In the hope that some other humans pass by.
If they see the signal, they'll come and rescue him.
I knew the chances of leaving this island would become slimmer as time went by.
I just didn't know how slim.
More humans on the island, that's not gonna happen.
And now my friends, like all good Englishman, a moment of silence.
To give thanks for this bountiful harvest.
Mind your manners.
Our host is...
Taking a snooze at the peers.
Ye he, he, or worse.
Hey, stop fooling around.
At least we're not out in that weather.
It's miserable out there.
Listen you guys... we're meant to live in the weather, have you'all gone soft.
Kiki, why get so worked up?
You haven's seen worked up, answer me this.
What happens to us when Crusoe leaves this island?
Have you thought of that.
Kiki, now, now, listen!
I'm listening!
I'm listening loud and clear, Mac!
Shall we eat!
If I could just find me some mussels!
One miscel little mussel.
It's mine, It's all mine!
Mine, mine, mine.
What´s yours!
Nothing.
You wouldn't be depriving your family!
Now, would you, sweetheart?
Yes.
I mean no.
Come here!
- Oh May, that hurts.
- Shame on you.
Look, the ship is falling apart.
Our luck is turning we'll be able to make it back to the main island after all.
Hey, let's say we go outside and have some fun on the water slide.
Great idea, I love all the smells after a good rain.
I'll catch with you guys later I better find Kiki first, make sure she's alright.
Why didn't that ship just vanish into the sea?
Our lives are never going to be the same again.
Show me that snack before we move on to the main island.
Help!
Scream all you want little bird.
No one is coming to save you now.
I'll be, the son of a seacook!
Watch out, children, is the human!
Get your filthy paws off my bird.
Epi, Pango.
To the left!
We have to get out of here quick!
Come on everyone!
We've got them surrounded!
Attack!
Kaboom!
Oh no!
He got me!
If this is heaven?
Why are you here?
They're heading for the big island.
They're everywhere!
It's all my fault.
We have to warn the others!
Get to the nest, now!
Hurry!
Predators!
- What?
- Did he say predators?
No.
Hang on everyone, I'll get my musket.
Batten down the hatches!
Batten down the hatches!
Weapons!
Gun powder!
Buckshot.
That's it, Tuesday!
Closes all.
They're everwhere!
Get off of me!
You bloody blasterds!
Ratters!
Tuesday!
- Help!
- Help!
Get me down from here!
I may not know humans, but they tend to be very angry.
Carmello!
Crusoe needs our help.
Look out!
Hurry, Epi!
Pango, over here!
Jump!
Stand back, Epi!
Hurry!
He's right behind you!
Go!
Go!
I need my musket!
Look what you've done.
You guys stay put!
Oh not, again!
Stay away you mange cats!
Hang on, Crusoe!
Good job, buddy.
Wasn't so bad!
Keep pushing!
I'll take care of these.
Pango!
Is awful high!
Come on, you can make it.
Jump!
Oh my... here, here it goes!
Good work!
Now, let's get out of here!
Ok!
So long, fur ball!
Hungry hour, well then take that!
Hakawa, Matata, Banana!
So long!
Scrubby, the door!
Come on!
Hello there!
Very glad, Scrubs!
Over here, Epi!
Hide in the bucket!
Going up!
Get off!
Get off!
Get off, you mengie cat!
Good Work, Epi!
They'll never get me!
We got rid of them, didn't we?
Epi!
Pango!
- Help me!
- Look up behind you, Epi!
Let go of me!
The cats are trying to get in through the hatch!
No!
No.
Rosie no, that was Crusoe!
Let me get this open.
I hope you didn't hurt him.
- Everybody ok?
- Everybody except Crusoe.
Come on guys, all together, is heavy.
Spread out Rosie, we need all the muscle we can mass bulk.
- Really?
- Ok, ok.
One, two, three!
That's a bit of a bummer, mate.
We need Crusoe, how's he doing, Kiki?
He's alive, but he wont be of any use to us.
We're gonna need a miracle to hold on these cats back!
Got it, the musket.
Watch out guys, it's gonna be noisy.
Are you sure that's a good idea?
Is worth the try, what else can we do?
This is going to be easier than I thought.
The human's house, time to make our move.
Hurry, we can't hold them off much longer.
He always pulls that thing to the back first.
Ok, get ready.
That's weird.
What's happening in there?
Hey Tuesday, maybe this thing has something to do with it.
What thing?
Now what?
You know they're gonna come back.
Maybe Crusoe may come to and save us.
I hate to break it to you guys, we're on our own.
We have to get out of here.
Hide in some place.
What about Crusoe?
Pango's right, we can't leave him here.
Guys, guys, it may not be perfect.
But I think I got a plan.
Well you better lay it out cause we're out of time.
Alright children, calm down.
They just got lucky this time we're gonna sneak up on them and make them pay.
Now let's show them what we're made of.
Oh, yeah.
You got a broken wing, have you?
Don't worry, we'll put you out of your misery.
Stay back, or I'll shoot!
Not so brave now, are you?
Appears your luck has just run out.
You'll have to be quicker than that, ratter.
Get him, he can't fly!
That should take care of you quite nicely.
Sweet dreams from your favorite ratter.
Get ready!
We got them cornered, May.
Then let's finish him off once and for all.
Catch me if you can, ratter!
Hold on.
Rosie stop, we have to wait for the signal.
This is it, give it all you have, Rosie.
What's going on?
They tricked us.
Hold on to your fangs.
I'll trap this bird.
We're not so cocky anymore, are we?
Tuesday is in trouble.
That was a bossus plan you had there, mate!
Couldn't have done it without you guys!
The fire!
Crusoe!
Crusoe!
Over here!
That must've really hurt.
We boat Crusoe out to safety unconscious, but alive.
And then out of the blue we get cannon blasted from your ship.
The captain can be one tough bloke.
Expect!
They're pirates after all.
Pirates?
You know, like them nasty ratchets only worse.
A pack of crazed cats in my right I was sure I was a goner.
I took my musket in one hand my sword in the other and carved a swat to the savage hordes.
It was horrible, captain.
That is the most fantastical yarn I've heard in all me life.
This is no yarn, captain?
So ye say, well then, just trying to set sail you and your bird can take a bunk below.
Oh, Captain, I cannot tell you how I love to see England again.
England!
We'll not be sailing from them ports unless you want me to be hanging from the gallows.
Right dreamer.
But you see, me...
I must...
Can you at least drop me from a bit closer to home.
You're with us now.
Once a pirate, always a pirate.
Have you got a problem with that?
But Captain, if I might--
Enough talk!
Off with ya!
Then I'll be expecting you in the carrier you lad or you will be walking the plank you will, or worse.
Look!
Is it a mirage, May?
It's not another mirage, you idiot.
It's a ship.
Children, start paddling.
♪ I ply my trade from the Union Jack!
♪
♪ Upon the seven seas ♪
♪ And unless I eat some rancid meat-- ♪
Hey, give me here, is my rum you're be drinking!
Oh!
You want some rum, do ya?
How's me fisting ye instead!
These are some nasty pirates but it won't end well if I stay another moment.
Hey, what you be fixing to do that?
Oh, nothing, nothing at all.
Is that right?
The ingrate, we dawn rescue... from the island is trying to steal one of our rowboats.
If pretty boy is going to be stealing anything, I'd be us!
No, I was just--
Hey, what's going on out here?
Bosun, he's trying to jump ship!
Get him in throne little prick.
Alright, let's teach him a lesson, take that!
It escapes, go for him!
He's getting away!
Grab him!
Give me a piece of him!
There's no way out of this ship, you fool!
Get him!
He's mine!
I'm ready!
A raft!
Ye fools, shooting the wrong side of the man, come on men.
Show me what are ye be made of.
Bosun!
Get your scurby excuse for a pirate down to my cabin, now!
Aye, aye, Captain, right away!
And the rest of ye fools!
Back to work, before I give each ten lashes of me whip.
Disgusting bird!
Damn!
He's getting away!
Shall we send some men after him?
Neh, let him go.
Oh, Captain, can't we fire a cannon short blow them his misery!
Why waste a good cannonball let'm spend the rest of his life on that long forgotten island.
That is if a wild beast doesn't get him first.
Aye, aye, Captain!
It's been nice knowing ya, Ruf.
We did ourselves a good run man, didn't we, Cec?
Jump!
I wasn't going to let those ratters get ya, we friends gotta stick together.
Nice for you to think so.
Where are we heading off to then?
We're going home!

Wake up!
You waky, waky!
Attack!

, here, swashbucklirus, and what is it!
, oh!
Oh, Bosun, is you?
Sorry to wake you, captain.
But there's a signal fire on the small Island off the starboard side.
What course of action shall we be taking.
Letmehavealook .
Some sort of house on fire.
What's this?
Fire abroad side!
Drive those bloody beasts off.
Aye, aye Captain!
Then go and bring back whoever he is.
And Bosun..
Make sure they leave nothing behind of any value.
Will do, captain.
Humans?
What you go by fellow?
Crusoe, Robinson Crusoe.
Looks like them wild beasts nearly had you for dinner.
Lucky we found you when we did.
- Oh, they are my..
- Hold on a second mate..
Let's have a look in there.
Not a single gold tooth in his head.
- Pity..
- Pirates!
Hey, ye've been one lucky bloke.
Crusoe, isn't?
I'm in your debt, Captain.
Ney!
, plus me eagle eye nightwatch then saved yer hide.
Well, let me tell ye, blasterd bird!
- No captain, he's with me.
- No captain..
he's with me.
A talking parrot.
What skullduggery is this?
Trying to talk yerself did ya?
Yes captain.
Drink up, that'll start yer stump smith.
Now, tell me more about this island of yarn..
Is there anything of..
shall we say.. value on it?
All I can say is that..
I was shipwrecked, marooned..
fending for myself with nothing but time and very few skills to survive.
Sorry about that.
I see the bird has taught ye how to drink as well.
That's not very polite Tuesday, you'll have to wait outside, I'm afraid.
Fendingformyself?
Really?
Listen.. you two wanna hear the true tale of Robinson Crusoe?
Oh, of.. sure, we're all ears, or at least Cecil here is.
- Hey, come on, Ruf..
It all begin like every other day before Crusoe came to my island.
Just another day in paradise, every day was the same.
Beautiful turquoise water, blue skies and lots of delicious fruit.
Sounds perfect right?
Boring if you ask me.
How much paradise can a bird take.
I really wanted to get off this island.
Let's see what's been washed up today?
Of course, more of these.
What's this?
This can be promising.
Heyguys,it is loolout time
Hey, ah.. be right there.
Hi Rosie, check out these delicious traits.
Gorgeous, just gorgeous.
Just look at all those bugs.
The beetles are the best.
Crunchy on the outside, with a soft gooey center.
Hey, where did it go?
- My kind of vermin.
- You thief.
Carmello, that wasn't very nice.
Aren't you joining us for a lool out today Mac?
, we're all here.
Yeah, I'll be right there, do we really need to lool out every day?
So, what did you bring today?
I'm not sure what it is.
I meant food for the lool out.
Of course he didn't bring anything for the lool out.
This is beautiful.
Hey, guy, guys, I think I really found something important this time
Check this out!
Where?
What?
- Scrubby, you're really going blind.
- Over here!
Oooh!
, smells delicious.
No, no, is not food.
It's proof that there's more to the world than just our island.
Oh, here we go again.
It's true.
Can't we just eat in peace for once.
Sure, no problem, just as long as you can tell me where this came from.
Fromthewater.
I vote for Carmello.
I too vote for Carmello.
Itoovotefor Carmello.
Oh, come on, this isn't election.
- The thing in the bobble is.. is..
- Is what?
You know what I think, Mac?
That thingy is whatever you want to believe it is.
Exactly
You are one hopeless dreamer.
Did you forget you almost died of exhaustion..
flying across the ocean..
looking for this other world of yours.
My dear macaw, you must wake up and smell the papaya.
For this is the world.
I don't care what you guys say, there's a bigger world out there and I intend to find it.
#I plymy trade from the Union Jack!
#uponthesevenseas #andunlessIeatsome rancid meat #buryme soulwhere the mermaid please
I wanna be mat makers of that green around the gills.
We ain't anchoring to be sharing your lunch with you, lad.
Sorry, I'm not much of a sailor.
You're there right.
If you're fixing the up jock find your way down we..
My hat.
Your poor stomach, you see..
wait 'till you get to them strange islands..
and you meet your first cannibals.
Cannibals?
We made our choice to go to sea, right, easy ol' pal?
And I swear, I'll not regret it.
Alright, go and bring me something to eat.
Right May, I wont fail you.
Good day, you lucky clucks will you join me for a little snack?
Come on now.
No need to be shy.
I'll chop you..
What business might you be having above decks?
I was just making sure my chicken food.
He, he, he.. friends..
were fresh.
No, warm..
warm and confy..
Get your fur over there..
not!
So, then, where were we?
Knockitoff
You cats belong down below, and stay away from our chickens.
That goes for you as well!
Who does that green gill land lover thinks he is?
The huminus, threw us into the haul?
This is our ship wretched as it is, it's home.
Mark my word now, someday, somehow, that canine and his human will pay.
I'm with you there mate, they'll pay alright.
How much exactly we're charging them?
That should teach them to mess with our egg supply.. hey ol' boy!
Oh, no, not again.
Buck up, boy' yo?
Ah, looks like we got one tuesday of a storm brewing.
So much for a peaceful meal.
Oh, nobody saw that one coming, hang on Carmello!
Perhaps it would be wise to move this far east to the cave.
Let's get moving, this is gonna be a nasty one.
I'm with you on that call.
Hey, Mac, grab the pineapple.
Like we really needed this pineapple.
Oh, hands on deck, and get those sails down.
Hey you self homemade, mister ride up the storm there.
Aynsley!
I got you.
Hey, hey!
Help!
Help!
Look out, flying away pineapple!
Sorry Pango.
- Careful Rosie.
- I got it!
Scrubby!
Heeeeelp!
Quick Rosie, the tree!
Easy Scrubby, don't panic.
Ok, I got you now.
Well, come on you old goat, get your hooves moving.
We ain't got all day.
That's it!
Eeeaasy..
don't be afraid.
One step at a time.
- Ooohh!
- Scrubby!
- Help!
He's not going to make it, do something!
Carmello, grab him.
I got hiiiiim...!
He..
He..
Heeeelp!
Help!
, we're in here!
Someone help!
Help!
Away!
Payback time!
I can't hold on 'mello, this is the end little buddy?
There's not much time, they're gonna fall.
Keep steady, I'm coming mates.
Pango, what are you doing?
Oohh!
How's it going mate?
Nice try Pango, but is hopeless, I'm a goner.
Mac!
Hold on!
Hold on!
Come on, come on, come on!
I'll get you guys out of there!
Ooohh!
, we have to do something!
Mac!
This just went from bad to worse.
Hey, don't worry guys, that branch looks pretty solid to me
Right, but how do we get down?
You got me there.
Oh, I can't believe it.
- They're alive!
- It's a miracle.
Hey, anybody wants some pineapple?
Do you hear that sound?
What's out there, Mac?
I have no idea.
Never heard a sound like that before.
Can you see anything?
Not a thing, unfortunately, we're gonna have to wait until morning.
Same old stuff.
Shells and more shells.
Swollen..
begones.
That's a new taste.. earthy, with a slight touch of salt.
Come on, come tu papa!
Hey, Scrubs..
what'd you find?
What is it you're eating?
I don't know, but it's delicious.
Oh, Scrubs..
you don't collect stuff like this.
My nose tells me there's more goodies at that rocky point.
- Oh, look at that?
- Wooden Ca..terpillars.
See, I was right.
This is the most incredible proof that there's another world out there.
No, look behind you?
What are you talking about, behind me?
I can't believe it.
Is the thing we heard dying last night.
What do you think it is?
The other world.
- I have to get a closer look.
- Mac don't, we have no idea what it is.
If it's dangerous, Mac?
This is amazing, I was right!
I knew it, I knew it, I knew it!
This is from the other world!
I've never seen anything like this.
Incredible!
Mac should be more careful.
Pango is right!
, we should keep our distance.
whaaa...wha.. wha..
what's going on?
Easy now, whatever you are.
I just want to talk.
See monsters?
Wow!
, look at this.
This heart makes me shoot leftings.
Hello, is anyone out there?
Hey, can anybody hear me?
Oh, look at it!
Captain?
, Bosen?
, anyone?
It's hideous!
Where did they all go.
I can't believe everyone is really gone.
Looks like there's just the two of us.
Let's go to shore.
Hang on Aynsley.
The current is really strong.
Land, sweet land!
Is so good to be alive Aynsley.
Pot your uncle, sea monsters walking on land?
Oh, oh!
We're in big trouble.
Only one thing has two legs.
A bird!
That ain't no bird I've ever seen.
Yeah, he can't even fly.
That monster is going to eat Carmello.
What's going on Aynsley?
We gotta do something, now!
Hurry, make as much noise as you can.
We have to scare those sea monsters off.
Come back here Aynsley.
Stay close together, we don't know what's out there.
What was that?
Aynsley?
, Aynsley what's that noise?
Cannibals!
Aynsley cannibals!
We have to get off this island.
Sailor warned us.
They'll skin us alive and eat us.
Hurry ol' boy, they're coming for us!
Get inside Aynsley, go boy, go, there.
Guys, guys, guys, what are you doing?
Scaring off the sea monsters, thank you very much.
And what if they aren't sea mosnters.
Did you see the furry one's teeth?
He'll reap us to shreds.
- Everybody calm down, we're safe here.
- Are we?
We really don't know what those creatures are capable of.
I know one thing they are capable of..
leaving the island.
What?
Oh, no, come on, this can't be happening to me.
He's actualy leaving.
We did it, we got rid of him.
Yeah, we scared them big time.
Will somebody tell me what's happening?
I'll tell you what's going on..
you guys have ruined my chance to get off this island and see the world.
You really don't get it, do you?
You think this is paradise, well, it is not.
It meant so much to me.
- He's back.
- Oh no, here we go again.
Back?
, are you serious?
, let me see.
Here's what we're gonna do, we stay out of sight.
And.. we keep an eye on them.
To see what they end up doing, ok?
Ok, then, nobody goes on the beach, that goes for you too Scrubby.
He, yeah, I heard you.
Didn't even get to finish my breakfast.
All of those new smells are driving me crazy.
I gotta go check it out.
Where are you going Scrubby?
Sssh, come back!
It's not safe out there.
Hmm.. can't let all those tasty mussels get washed away.
If I recall correctly didn't Mac say we should all stay out of sight.
He did.
Speaking of which, where is Mac?
Sorry about today ol' friend, that was a pretty inactive attempt.
What was I thinking?
, I haven't the foggiest idea where we are.
All for that matter, the slightest inkling in which direction to set sail.
Someone is bound to come and save us 'ol boy.
I'm sure of it.
If those cannibals come back, we'll be ready for them.
Who's out there?
Show yourselves!
I don't want to tear you to shreds.
And I have a musket.
[Beeeeee]
A goat?
oh, It´s just a goat..
A bird?
, maybe there aren't hunters and cannibals after all.
Mac, what were you doing out there all by yourself?
I thought you said we should stay hidden.
I was just..checking things out, that's all.
What's all the commotion about anyway.
Well, Epi just made a good point.
I just suggested, hypothetically, that possibly the sea monster..
lost that thing that Mac jiffy found.
- And maybe he's come to get it back.
- Along with us.
Is one of two things for sure..
a coincidence, or a baaad omen.
In a way you need to get rid of it.
Why not just give it back to the sea monsters.
- A "G" idea.
- No way!
- Wha..wha..wha..
- You're kidding!
- You're so selfish.
- Selfish?
Ok, maybe.
Just give me time to think about it.
But if I do give it back, you're all coming with me.
Well..
We're right there Aynsley.
We got some work to do.
Let's save all we can before is all lost to the sea.
How is he looking mate?
They're taking over our beach.
He's pulling strange stuff out from the sea.
I suppose this means they're not leaving anytime soon, then.
Looks that way.
Do you see how the furry one sleeps all day while the big one does the work.
No, but I'll take your word for it.
I bet the sleeping one is the boss.
Look, he stripped off his skin.
Ugh..
I'm going to be sick.
Noneofus knewitatthetime, but we were being watched by the real monsters on the island
Some luck May..
their green gill human and his manking mock mating safety here.
How are we gonna deal with him, he might be a problem for us.
Don't you worry, I'll figure out a way to get rid of them quick enough
For the time being we sit, watch and wait.
Oohh, come on May, I'm starving here.
And cut to what I just say!
Sit, watch and wait.
That's right, now stay focused.
We got the upper claw.
No one knows we're here, which means we take our time..
and we pick them off one by one.
Ha, look Aynsley, this can come in very handy
I gotta to practice before we venture out there to get our dinner, right boy!
#I plymy trade from the Union Jack!
#uponthesevenseas #unlessIeat some rancid meat #buryme soulwhere the mermaid please
Steady!
-What'she doing?
- Shh.
Back your hammer, and..
I don't know about you Scrubby, but I'm planning on stayting as far away from that monster as possible.
- What was that all about?
- I have absolutely no idea.
What we need to find out, is what these newcomers intentions are,
Fromthesoundofit, they're up to no good
- Obviously they're trying to kill us.
- Maybe, but maybe not.
The truth of the matter is that these newcomers have brought nothing but trouble to our paradise, that is a fact.
Fine, then do like I ask, and stay out of sight.
they're proof that there's another world out there and I'm going to find out whether they're friend or foe.
You really don't get it, do you!
That was close!
Ok, let's give this a go, one last time.
Oh!
Did you see that Aynsley!
I did it, I hit the mark!
Let's go fix something to eat, ol' boy.
That was a miracle, I'd never thought I'd hit it.
Well..
I canhit something after all..
I was starting to wonder if everyone wasn't right, the new world was finally here and I had no idea if I was ready for it or not.
Tapir'sreadyas i've ever seen.
Goforthethroat, let's make this quick
Wait,thehuman!
Oh, I can't do it boy, go on, shuu, go!
What now?
Sorry pal,
I've never shot anything before, why don't we try fishing.
What's burning?
Thatwouldbe me .
You smell like bump biscuits.
Shh,something'scoming.
Looks like Rosie was here, that's strange,
Rosie never leaves any food behind.
Would you prefer light or dark meat for lunch, darling?
I prefer...
Dog!
Ready to get even, ratter!
Hold Aynsley, I'm coming, those blasted ratters, they did survive after all.
I'm hit!
Run for it!
Good dog!
You're alright ol' boy?
Did you I hear that?
Over there!
It's a bird, a beautiful parrot.
Strangely, that's what all the fuss was about
The ratters went after the bird.
You did good ol' boy, and you, we're gonna fix you up straight away.
Look Aynsley!
a ring!
that can only mean one thing
Sailors have sail for this island before
I believe there's hope for us after all.
You can come out guys, there's no one around.
It's too dark, I can't see a thing.
This is the very spot where that sea monster attack me.
Well, sort of..
Oh!
I've almost..
We shouldn't have let him go alone.
Maybe he's molting.
That's a bit of a stretch Pango.
Just wait 'till I get my hooves on them!
Anyway you look at it, this is not good.
Mac can't be gone.
What's that?
And who are you two?
Just two homeless castaways, we were held captive by that human for months with nothing to eat but the crumbs from his table.
What about our friend?
Did you see him by any chance?
Oh, It's a true tragedy, alright.
Oh, an unfortunate turn of events.
You see we caught..!
We saw the hosting.
Well, come on, let's hear it.
What are you waiting for?
We'll tell you what happened to your friend.
For I'm warning you, it ain't pretty.
You see, the human loves to eat birds, and I'm afraid your friend got..
trapped.
This should only take a minute, It's just dislocated.
But.. it's going to hurt, a bit.
Don't worry.
You´ll feel better in a day or two, though you won't be able to fly right away.
Well then, I suppose you'll need name if you're gonna stay here for a while.
Let's see, by my reckoning today is.. tuesday, that's a good a name as any, mate.
Can you say..
Tuesday.
T u e s d a y
Well, not quite, but that's a start.
Take care of our new friend, boy.
I'd better offload as much stuff as I can.
There's no telling how much the ship will stay in one piece.
- They're nothing but cannibals!
- Murderers.
I say we run him off our island drive them monsters back into the sea!
Perhaps a plan might be to force them to live on curse island.
Oh, yes, yes, yes.
Curse Island.
What exactly is Curse Island?
Hu, hu, hu, the end of the earth, mate, no one's ever made it back from there.
Yeah, there's nothing there but bugs.
Lots and lots of nasty bugs!
Sounds purrrfect, drive them to curse island.
That's not gonna work.
You have a better idea?
No.
Right, so then, where were we?
Stop your flapping about bird.
You need to be resting that wing of yours.
What do you want from me?
I just want to talk.
Me name is Aynsley, and for what I understand yours is Tuesday.
Call me whatever you want, except dinner.
Dinner?
, we're not going to eat you, we saved your life.
Either way, you don't make much of a meal.
Not like a fat, juicy turkey sweetheart back at home.
- What?
- Relax.
My master likes you.
- You said, your master?
- You did not think that I...
I like you, you're funny.
I've never seen a bird like you in England.
England
Tell me more Aynsley.
Well buddy, England, my island.
Just one fantastic place in a sea of many lands.
I knew it!
Crusoe wants to explore them all.
If we ever get off this one.
You know, you're the first to come from the outside world.
Oh dear, ha,ha,ha, that's not good news.
Hey, hold on a second, we're all dress up like this.. because...?
Because you look fierce, now get your heads in the game everyone.
We have the perfect opportunity, the dog and that bird are still on the ship.
Right.
Listen up!
here's the plan, we'll deal with the hairy beast on the ship.
The rest of you.
Go for the human on the beach.
What is sheep?
That wooden thing on the beach.
As soon we're on the ship, "the wooden thing".
- You attack!
- Alright then, fierce, fierce, fierce!
So, I'm a fierce coconut?
But I should go tell my friends that I'm ok.
You better stay put, you're in no condition to fly.
Well, look at this..
we can kill two birds with one stone.
There's two birds now?
Oh, shut it, just follow my lead.
Look, look!
that's him.
- He's wearing Mac like a trophy.
- That is so wrong!
Attack!
Let's get'em.
Aynsley, we gotta go.
What's going on out there.
They've all got mad.
Itappearsas yourfriendshave come to avenge your death.
I'm not dead!
Oh, we're gonna take care of that.. right now.
Aynsley!
Help!
Aynsley!
Help!
Come on down there and fight!
Aynsley!
Twist it!
- Hold on, that sounded like..
- Mac!
Aynsley!
- Mac, get out!
- Kiki!
Mac!
I'm coming boy!
Rotten cats!
You are to blame for all this!
Gotta leave the ship, mate!
- Aynsley!
- Go!
What's happening here?
I thought Mac was dead.
We all did, but I don't think he made it this time.
That would be horrible..
Come on guys, we better move back now.
Oh no, Aynsley, what have I done.
Land...
Land!
We're safe, mate, I thought we were goners.
Oh, will you just shut up!
- What's that noise?
- That would be bugs.
- Bugs!
- Curse Island!
Rest in peace ol' boy.
Tuesday.
- Pss, Mac!
- Kiki!
Mac, you're hurt!
I'll be ok.
I'm sure glad to see you.
- I was worried.
- Me too.
Come on, now is your chance to get away
- I can't.
- Well, let me help you.
No, no, no, I just, I don't, want to get away.
- What?
- You don't understand, is all those cats fault.
- What do you mean...
- They attacked me, he fixed my wing.
And his dog gave his life to save me.
I can't leave him now
Oh, I see.
So, he's going to take care of you?
Look, he's gonna need my help to survive.
I owe him that.
Exactly, how do you plan on doing that?
I mean, look at him.
Ah!
, Tuesday!
Help!
I don't believe it, those cats used us and Mac as well, and what do we do?
We attacked the human.
Hold on, then.
So, what you're saying is Kiki's debrained fault on this.
Oh, fatal.
That'snotfair,weall thought Mac was dead.
-Didn'twe ?
- Oh, this is not good, mate.
Yeah, we've made a real mess of things.
Looks that way Epi gal.
- Where are you going Rosie?
- I'm going to clean up our mess.
- I'm in!
- Let's get cracking then, mate.
Wait a second.
You're going to make an even bigger mess of things.
Wild beasts, they're going to get us!
Stay right where you are.
I've got a special treat for all of you.
I just wanted to give you some biscuits, that's all.
They're quite good.
I finished off your dog human and I promise one day you and the rest of your lot will join him.
Now that, is the taste of desperation.
Try to get one, they taste just like chicken.
What, do you want to show me something?
Alright, let's go!
Tuesday.
This is fantastic.
Fresh water.
Good job..
Tuesday.
What?
You want me to follow you?
Okay, I'm coming!
Hey guys, look who's here.
Relax.. there's nothing to be afraid of.
Stay right where you are, I'll be right back.
What got into him, why is he running away?
- Beats me.
- Maybe it's your smell.
Try one of these, it's really good.
And some for you, and try.
So choosy, where's pretty bird.
i haven't see her yet.
Prettybird.
You don't need to yell Mac, I mean Tuesday.
- I'm right here.
- Here you have pretty bird.
Here, do you see, I don't hurt you.
Come on, don't be afraid.
Comeonprettybird.
Well, friendships aren't made in a day.
Taking one step at a time, right choosy.
Onestep.
I can't May, the current is too strong.
So, you failed again, did you?
Would you stop feeling sorry for yourself?
Oh, time will come.
Soon there will be more of us.
Revenge will be sweet.
That hurt.
Ah, you can't see a bloody thing, can you old goat?
We're gonna have to fix that.
There you are.
That should help.
Why Rosie, you're no pig.
Hey, what has gotten into you?
You're gorgeous?
Easy big boy.
No, no.
Oh no.
Tuesday help.
Hey guys!
Nevermind.
This is hopeless.
How am I ever going to survive in this island?
Yes, of course, that's it!
I have to build a tree house!
It's raining tree limbs.
Is good enough to eat.
Is there anything you wouldn't eat?
Hey snail, what's he doing?
Come on mate, he's just bunkers on us.
He's destroying the tree.
I can't saw more...
Need to finish shelter..
we must build..
Yes Sir. a whole porridge.. please.
We had no clue what Crusoe was up to.
Sawing..
porridge..
Yep, as Pango would say, he was bonkers to the max.
Are you coming along May.
Can I have just a little peak?
Can you just wait, I'm cleaning them up.
Well could you at least tell me how big a litter we have?
More than we'll ever be able to feed, I'm afraid.
You look kittie..
That's smart.
I'm trying to work here, go eat somewhere else.
At this rate, I'll never get this built.
I told you, go!
Ah, nevermind.
What I wouldn't give for an extra set of hands.
For all his pounding and sawing we couldn't figure what he was actually doing.
What is going on?
- Really?
- I couldn't blame Rosie.
When you got an itch, you gotta scatch it.
The poor Crusoe he didn't see it that way.
He has had enough.
and that's when it hit me..
a nest..
Hey, guys.
I've figured out what he was doing..
Making an ass?
His building a shelter.
- We don't follow you mate.
- He's building a nest.
- A nest?
- So he is a bird.
Scrubs.
He's building a human nest in the tree.
Pretty clever.
I've never slept in a tree.
If he stocks it with food, you'll sleep in a tree.
Good point, so guys, I got an idea, what do you say we help'm out.
Get this nest of his built.
I must've been crazy, thinking I can build all this by my..
self..
We didn't really have any idea what we were getting into.
We just figure let's help, use whatever abilities we had and hoped it all worked.
I 'll be gobsmacked.
Slowly, slowly.
Slowly, slowly.
That's it, just a little more.
Hi Epi, where are you headed with all that food?
I need a little help here guys.
Not that kind of help.
It tickles.
Epi hold up, I'm starving.
Help.
Things didn't always go smoothly and we had our ups and downs.
That's for sure.
But everyone was in fine spirits and Crusoe seemed..
well.. happy.
He made a funny little door for Epi and Pango to get into the nest.
It was a pretty good idea.
After a few modifications that is.
We became a real team, playing all these funny games Crusoe came up with.
He had all sorts of crazy ideas oh, and hide and seek in the ground.
Crusoe had a funny way of eating, he peeled the fruit.
And boy did he eat slow.
It took quite a while but despite his ackwardness and all of his flaws
Crusoe surprised even the most skeptical among us.
That's it, that's it, watch your step.
I've just put the finishing touches on our new home.
New home, hold it right there, first thing we must do is christen the place.
It's good luck you know.
I christen thee.
Oh, nevermind.
The preach is for us.
Wow, now look at that.
It's so beautiful.
Hip, hip, hooray!
What in the world is that noise he's making?
Sounds like Scrubby when he needs food.
It's painful mate, let's get out of here.
Personally, I think it sounds beautiful.
A party and we weren't invited.
Now, could you come here.
- I'm starving here.
- Coming.
You know how difficult it is in my condition to hunt right now.
Have you tried to make it to the other island lately.
Oh May, you know the last time I'd tried I almost drowned.
I'm afraid we're just stuck with just the bugs and spiders.
They sound delicious.
Now go and hunt some up for me!
Right.. darling.
I'll wrap'em in seeweed just the way you like'em.
With the nest completed, Crusoe moved on to a new project.
We didn't have to forage for food, we had this great nest and we even had indoor plumbing.
Paradise.. just got better.
That human sure has made life peachy for us.
Rosie is sponsor to the max,
I tell ye ol' girl, if this new world talks about this cuchie it might not be that bad after all.
Getting a little plump aren't we, sitting around all day?
Ain't nothing wrong with a few curves, Kiki honey.
With Crusoe doing the fishing, it would put the superb in you too in no time, Kiki.
Oh, what do we have here?
Looks like Crusoe is going to put your fish and scales to shame, Kiki.
As time passed, life became more and more confortable for us all.
Yet, Crusoe seemed very sad at times, he missed his old world.
He build a strange tower on the highest point of the island.
with bright lights burning every night.
Another day and no ship in sight little fellow.
what I wouldn't give to see the sun set over the Thames.
Thames?
I'm going partner.
I don't get it, why does he light this thing every night?
In the hope that some other humans pass by.
If they see the signal, they'll come and rescue him.
I knew the chances of leaving this island, would become slimmer as time went by
I just didn't know how slim.
More humans on the island, that's not gonna happen.
And now my friends, like all good Englishman, a moment of silence.
To give thanks for this bountiful harvest.
Mind your manners.
Our host is.
- Taking a snooze at the peers.
- Ye he, he, or worse.
Hey, stop fooling around.
At least we're not out in that weather.
It's miserable out there.
listen you guys, we're meant to live in the weather, have you'all gone soft.
Wow, wow, Kiki, why get so worked up?
Oh, you haven's seen worked up, answer me this,
What happens to us when Crusoe leaves this island?
- have you thought of that.
- Kiki, now, now, listen!
I'm listening!
, I'm listening loud and clear, Mac!
Shall we eat!
If I could just find me some mussels!
One miscel little mussel.
Oh, It's mine, It's all mine, mine, mine, mine.
- What´s yours!
- Nothing.
You wouldn't be depriving your family!
Now, would you sweetheart?
- Yes..
..I mean no.
Come here!
- Oh May, that hurts.
- Shame on you.
Look, the ship is falling apart.
Our luck is turning, we'll be able to make it back to the mainland after all.
Hey, let's say we go outside and have some fun on the water slide.
Great idea, I love all the smells after a good rain.
I'll catch with you guys later, I better find Kiki first, make sure she's alright.
Why didn't that ship just vanish into the sea.
Our lives are never going to be the same again.
Show me that snack before we move on to the main island.
- No!
- Scream all you want little bird.
No one is coming to save you now.
- I'll be the son of a seacook!
- Watch out children, is the human!
Get your filthy paws off my bird.
- To the left!
- We have to get out of here quick!
Come on everyone!
we've got them surrounded!
- Attack!
- kaboom!
Oh no!
He got me!
If this is heaven?
Why are you here?
Shut!
They're heading for the big island.
They're everywhere!
It's all my fault.
We have to warn the others!
Get to the nest, now!
Hurry!
- Predators!
- What?
- Did he say predators?
Hang on if you want, I'll get my musket.
Fang down the hatches!
- Down the hatches!
- Weapons!
Gun powder!
I need some shirt.
That's it juicy!
They're everwhere!
Get off of me!
You bloody blasterds!
Help!
get me down from here!
I may not know humans, but they tend to be very angry.
Crusoe needs our help.
Look out!
Hurry Epi!
Pango, over here!
-Jump!
- Stand back Epi!
Hurry!
He's right behind you!
Go!
, go!
I need my musket!
look what you've done, You guys stay put!
Oh not again!
Stay away you mange cats!
Hang on Crusoe!
Good job buddy.
Wasn't so bad!
Keep puching!
I'll take care of these.
Pango!
Wow, is awful high!
Come on, you can make it.
Jump!
Oh my, here it goes!
Good work!
Now, let's get out of here!
Ok!
So long, furrball!
Hungry hour, well then take that!
Hakawa, Matata, banana!
So long!
Scrubby, the door!
Come on!
Hello there!
Very glad Scrubs!
Over here, Epi!
Hide in the bucket!
Going up!
Get off!
Get off, you mengie cat!
Good Work, Epi!
They'll never get me!
We got rid of them, didn't we?
Epi!
Pango!
- Help me!
- Look up behind you, Epi!
Let go of me!
The cats are trying to get in through the hatch!
Rosie no, that was Crusoe!
Let me get this open.
I hope you didn't hurt him.
- Everybody ok?
- Everybody except Crusoe.
Come on guys, all together, is heavy.
- Spread out Rosie, we need all the muscle we can mass bulk.
- Really?
Ok, ok.
One, two, three!
That's a bit of a bummer mate.
We need Crusoe, how's he doing Kiki?
He's alive, but he wont be of any use to us.
We're gonna need a miracle to hold on these cats back!
Got it, the musket.
Watch out guys, it's gonna be noisy.
Are you sure that's a good idea?
Is worth the try, what else can we do?
This is going to be easier than I thought.
The human's house, time to make our move.
Hurry, we can't hold 'em off much longer.
He always pulls that thing to the back first.
Ok, get ready.
Huh, that's weird.
What's happening in there?
Hey Tuesday, maybe this thing has something to do with it.
What thing?
Now what?
You know they're gonna come back.
Maybe Crusoe may come to and save us.
I hate to break it to you guys, we're on our own.
We have to get out of here.
Hide in some place.
What about Crusoe?
Pango's right, we can't leave him here.
Guys, guys, it may not be perfect.
But I think I got a plan.
Well you better lay it out cause we're out of time.
Alright children, calm down.
They just got lucky this time, we're gonna sneak up on them and make them pay.
Now let's show them what we're made of.
Oh, yeah.
You got a broken wing, have you?
Don't worry, we'll put you out of your misery.
Stay back, or I'll shoot!
Not so brave now, are you?
Appears your luck has just run out.
You'll have to be quicker than that, ratter.
Get him, he can't fly!
That should take care of you quite nicely.
Sweet dreams from your favorite ratter.
Get ready!
We got'em cornered May.
Then let's finish him off once and for all.
Catch me if you can, ratter!
Rosie stop, we have to wait for the signal.
This is it, give it all you have Rosie.
- Which way?
They tricked us.
- Hold on to your fangs.
We're not so cocky anymore.
Are we?
Tuesday is in trouble.
That was a bossus plan you had there mate!
Couldn't have done it without you guys!
The fire!
Crusoe!
Crusoe!
Over here!
Ouch!
, that must've really hurt.
We boat Crusoe out to safety unconscious, but alive.
And then out of the blue, we get cannon blasted from your ship.
Ahoy!
, the captain can be one tough bloke.
Expect!
They're pirates after all.
Pirates?
He, he, you know, like them nasty ratchets only worse.
A pack of crazed cats in my right I was sure I was a goner.
And I took my musket in one hand my sword in the other, carved a swat to the savage hordes.
It was horrible captain.
That is the most fantastical yarn I've heard in all me life.
This is no yarn, captain?
So ye say, well then, just trying to set sail, you and your bird can take a bunk below.
Oh, Captain, I cannot tell you how I love to see England again.
England!
We'll not be sailing from them ports unless you want me to be hanging from the gallows.
Right dreamer.
But you see, me..
I.. must..
Can you at least drop me from a bit closer to home.
You're with us now.
Once a pirate, always a pirate.
Have you got a problem with that?
But Captain, if I might...
Enough talk!
Off with ya!
Then I'll be expecting you in the carrier you lad, or you will be walking the plank you will or worse.
Look!
is it a mirage May?
It's not another mirage you idiot.
It's a ship, children start paddling.
#I plymy trade from the Union Jack!
#uponthesevenseas #unlessIeat some rancid...
Hey, give me here, is my rum you're be drinking!
Oh!
you want some rum!
do ya?
How's me fisting ye instead.
These are some nasty pirates, but it wont end well if I stay another moment.
Hey, what you be fixing to do that?
Oh, nothing, nothing at all.
Is that right?
The ingrate we dawn rescue from the island is trying to steal one of our rowboats.
If prettyboy is going to be stealing anything, I'd be us!
No, I was just..
Hey, what's going on out here?
Bosun, he's trying to jump ship!
Get him in throne little prick.
Alright, let's teach him a lesson, take that.
He's getting away!
grab him!
Give me a piece of him!
There's no way out of this ship you fool!
Get him!
He's mine!
I'm ready!
A raft!
Ye fools, shooting the wrong side of the man, come on men..
show me what are ye be made of.
Bosun!
Get your scurby excuse for a pirate down to my cabin, now!
Aye, aye, Captain, right away!
And the rest of ye fools!
Back to work, before I give each ten lashes of me whip.
Disgusting bird!
He's getting away!
Shall we send some men after him?
Neh, let him go.
Oh, Captain, can't we fire a cannon short blow'em his misery!
Why waste a good cannonball, let'm spend the rest of his life on that long forgotten island.
That is if a wild beast doesn´t get him first.
Aye, aye, Captain!
It's been noice nawing ya Ruf..
we did ourselves a good run man, didn't we Cec..
Jump!
I wasn't going to let those ratters get ya, we friends gotta stick together.
Nice for you to think so.
Where are we heading off to then?
We're going home!
THE WILD LIFE
Oh, disc it.
Task it a biscuit, Hold Dr. Ceci.
Stop your plan it.
Almost.
There.
We'll be shadow puppets.
Why haven't got me breakfast yet, either?
Catou!
Shadow puppets?
Seriously mate.
You are one kidney short of a meat pie.
I was..
Give me.
Go!
Get off of me, you good for nothing feline, Catou!
Say you can't even get a nice sleep without some fleery, limey?
Signal fire off the starboard bow!
Signal fire!
Starboard bow!
Captain, captain!
Wake up!
You waky, waky!
Attack!
Board the ship!
Here, swashbucklirus, and what is it!
Bosun, is you?
Sorry to wake you, captain.
But there's a signal fire on the small Island off the starboard side.
What course of action shall we be taking.
Let me have a look.
Some sort of house on fire.
What's this?
Fire abroad side!
Drive those bloody beasts off.
Aye, aye, Captain!
Then go and bring back whoever he is.
And Bosun, make sure they leave nothing behind of any value.
Will do, captain.
Humans?
What you go by fellow?
Crusoe, Robinson Crusoe.
Looks like them wild beasts nearly had you for dinner.
Lucky we found you when we did.
- Oh, they are my--
- Hold on a second mate.
Let's have a look in there.
Not a single gold tooth in his head.
- Pity.
- Pirates!
Hey, ye've been one lucky bloke.
Crusoe, isn't?
I'm in your debt, Captain.
Ney!
Plus me eagle eye night watch then saved yer hide.
Well, let me tell ye, blasterd bird!
- No Captain, he's with me.
- No Captain.
He's with me.
A talking parrot.
What skull duggery is this?
Trying to talk yerself, did ya?
Yes captain.
Drink up, that'll start yer stump smith.
Now, tell me more about this island of yarn.
Is there anything of... shall we say...
value on it?
All I can say is that--
I was shipwrecked, marooned.
Fending for myself with nothing but time and very few skills to survive.
Sorry about that.
I see the bird has taught ye how to drink as well.
That's not very polite, Tuesday you'll have to wait outside, I'm afraid.
"Fending for myself?"
Really?
Listen.
You two wanna hear the true tale of Robinson Crusoe?
Of sure, we're all ears or at least Cecil here is.
Hey, come on, Ruf.
It all begin like every other day before Crusoe came to my island.
Just another day in paradise every day was the same.
Beautiful turquoise water blue skies and lots of delicious fruit.
Sounds perfect, right?
Boring if you ask me.
How much paradise can a bird take?
I really wanted to get off this island.
Let's see what's been washed up today?
Of course, more of these.
What's this?
This can be promising.
Hey guys, it is lool out time.
Hey... be right there.
Hi Rosie, check out these delicious traits.
Gorgeous, just gorgeous.
Just look at all those bugs.
The beetles are the best.
Crunchy on the outside, with a soft gooey center.
Hey, where did it go?
- My kind of vermin.
- You thief.
Carmello, that wasn't very nice.
Aren't you joining us for a lool out today, Mac?
We're all here.
Yeah, I'll be right there...
Do we really need to lool out every day?
So, what did you bring today?
I'm not sure what it is.
I meant food for the lool out.
Of course he didn't bring anything for the lool out.
This is beautiful.
Hey, guys, guys...
I think I really found something important this time.
Check this out!
Where?
What?
Scrubby, you're really going blind.
Over here!
Smells delicious.
No, no, is not food.
It's proof that there's more to the world than just our island.
Here we go again.
It's true.
Can't we just eat in peace for once.
Sure, no problem just as long as you can tell me where this came from.
From the water.
I vote for Carmello.
I too vote for Carmello.
I too vote for Carmello.
Oh, come on, this isn't election.
The thing in the bobble is... is...
Is what?
You know what I think, Mac?
That thingy is whatever you want to believe it is.
- Exactly.
- You are one hopeless dreamer.
Did you forget you almost died of exhaustion.
Flying across the ocean, looking for this other world of yours.
My dear macaw, you must wake up and smell the papaya.
For this is the world.
I don't care what you guys say... there's a bigger world out there and I intend to find it.
♪ I ply my trade from the Union Jack!
♪
♪ Upon the seven seas ♪
♪ And unless I eat some rancid meat ♪
♪ Bury me soul where the mermaid please ♪
Look that we have.
I wanna be mat makers of that green around the gills.
We ain't anchoring to be sharing your lunch with you, lad.
Sorry, I'm not much of a sailor.
You're there right.
If you're fixing the up jock find your way down we.
My hat, don't--
Your poor stomach you see wait till you get to them strange islands and you meet your first cannibals.
Cannibals?
We made our choice to go to sea, right, easy old pal?
And I swear, I'll not regret it.
Alright, go and bring me something to eat.
Right May, I wont fail you.
Good day, you lucky clucks will you join me for a little snack?
Come on now.
No need to be shy.
I'll chop you.
What business might you be having above decks?
I was just making sure my chicken food.
If you wish we be...
Friends.
Were fresh.
No, warm.
Warm and confy.
Get your fur over there.
Not!
So, then, where were we?
Knock it off.
You cats belong down below, and stay away from our chickens.
That goes for you as well!
Who does that green gill land lover thinks he is?
The huminus, threw us into the haul?
This is our ship wretched as it is, it's home.
Mark my word now, someday, somehow that canine and his human will pay.
I'm with you there mate, they'll pay alright.
How much exactly we're charging them?
That should teach them to mess with our egg supply, old boy!
Eggs.
Oh, no, not again.
Buck up, boy yo?
Looks like we got one Tuesday of a storm brewing.
So much for a peaceful meal.
Oh, nobody saw that one coming, hang on Carmello!
Perhaps it would be wise to move this far east to the cave.
Let's get moving, this is gonna be a nasty one.
I'm with you on that call.
Hey, Mac, grab the pineapple.
Like we really needed this pineapple.
All hands on deck, and get those sails down.
Hey you self homemade, mister ride up the storm there.
Aynsley!
I got you.
Hey, hey!
Help!
Help!
Look out, flying away pineapple!
Sorry Pango.
Careful Rosie.
I got it!
Scrubby!
Help!
Quick Rosie, the tree!
Easy Scrubby, don't panic.
Ok, I got you now.
Well, come on you old goat, get your hooves moving.
We ain't got all day.
That's it!
Easy.
Don't be afraid.
One step at a time.
- Scrubby!
- Help!
He's not going to make it, do something!
Carmello, grab him.
I got him...
Help!
Help!
we're in here!
Someone help!
Help!
No, no!
Away!
Payback time!
I can't hold on Carmello, this is the end little buddy?
There's not much time, they're gonna fall.
Keep steady, I'm coming mates.
Pango, what are you doing?
How's it going mate?
Nice try Pango, but is hopeless, I'm a goner.
Mac!
Hold on!
Hold on!
Come on, come on, come on!
I'll get you guys out of there!
We have to do something!
Oh, no!
Mac!
This just went from bad to worse.
Hey, don't worry guys, that branch looks pretty solid to me.
Right, but how do we get down?
You got me there.
Oh, I can't believe it.
They're alive!
It's a miracle.
Hey, anybody wants some pineapple?
Do you hear that sound?
- What's out there, Mac?
- I have no idea.
Never heard a sound like that before.
Can you see anything?
Not a thing unfortunately, we're gonna have to wait until morning.
Same old stuff.
Shells and more shells.
Swollen.
Begones.
That's a new taste.
Earthy, with a slight touch of salt.
Come on, come tu papa!
Hey Scrubs, what'd you find?
What is it you're eating?
I don't know, but it's delicious.
Oh, Scrubs.
You don't collect stuff like this.
My nose tells me there's more goodies at that rocky point.
Look at that?
Wooden Ca... terpillars.
See, I was right.
This is the most incredible proof that there's another world out there.
No, look behind you?
What are you talking about, behind me?
I can't believe it.
Is the thing we heard dying last night.
What do you think it is?
The other world.
- I have to get a closer look.
- Mac don't, we have no idea what it is.
If it's dangerous, Mac?
This is amazing, I was right!
I knew it, I knew it, I knew it!
This is from the other world!
I've never seen anything like this.
Incredible!
Mac should be more careful.
Pango is right!
We should keep our distance.
What...
What's going on?
Easy now, whatever you are.
I just want to talk.
See monsters?
Wow.
Look at this.
This heart makes me shoot leftings.
Hello!
Is anyone out there?
Hey, can anybody hear me?
Look at it!
Captain?
Bosun?
Anyone?
It's... hideous!
Where did they all go.
I can't believe everyone is really gone.
Looks like there's just the two of us.
Let's go to shore.
Hang on Aynsley.
The current is really strong.
Land, sweet land!
Is so good to be alive, Aynsley.
Pot your uncle, sea monsters walking on land?
We're in big trouble.
Only one thing has two legs.
A bird!
That ain't no bird I've ever seen.
Yeah, he can't even fly.
That monster is going to eat Carmello.
What's going on, Aynsley?
We gotta do something, now!
Hurry, make as much noise as you can.
We have to scare those sea monsters off.
Come back here, Aynsley.
Stay close together, we don't know what's out there.
What was that?
Aynsley?
Aynsley what's that noise?
Cannibals!
Aynsley cannibals!
We have to get off this island.
Sailor warned us.
They'll skin us alive and eat us.
Hurry old boy, they're coming for us!
Get inside Aynsley, go boy, go, there.
Guys, guys, guys, what are you doing?
Scaring off the sea monsters, thank you very much.
And what if they aren't sea mosnters.
Did you see the furry one's teeth?
He'll reap us to shreds.
- Everybody calm down, we're safe here.
- Are we?
We really don't know what those creatures are capable of.
I know one thing they are capable of.
Leaving the island.
What?
Oh, no, come on, this can't be happening to me.
He's actualy leaving.
We did it.
We got rid of him.
Yeah, we scared them big time.
Will somebody tell me what's happening?
I'll tell you what's going on.
You guys have ruined my chance to get off this island and see the world.
You really don't get it, do you?
You think this is paradise, well, it is not.
It meant so much to me.
He's back.
Oh no, here we go again.
Back?
Are you serious?
Let me see.
Here's what we're gonna do, we stay out of sight.
And, we keep an eye on them.
To see what they end up doing, ok?
Ok, then, nobody goes on the beach... that goes for you too Scrubby.
Yeah, yeah, I heard you.
Didn't even get to finish my breakfast.
All of those new smells are driving me crazy.
I gotta go check it out.
Where are you going, Scrubby?
Come back!
It's not safe out there.
Can't let all those tasty mussels get washed away.
If I recall correctly didn't Mac say we should all stay out of sight.
He did.
Speaking of which, where is Mac?
Sorry about today, old friend, that was a pretty inactive attempt.
What was I thinking?
I haven't the foggiest idea where we are.
All for that matter the slightest inkling in which direction to set sail.
Someone is bound to come and save us, old boy.
I'm sure of it.
If those cannibals come back, we'll be ready for them.
Who's out there?
Show yourselves!
I don't want to tear you to shreds.
And I have a musket.
A goat?
It´s just a goat.
A bird?
Maybe there aren't hunters and cannibals after all.
Mac, what were you doing out there all by yourself?
I thought you said we should stay hidden.
I was just checking things out, that's all.
What's all the commotion about anyway.
Well, Epi just made a good point.
I just suggested, hypothetically that possibly the sea monster lost that thing that Mac jiffy found.
- And maybe he's come to get it back.
- Along with us.
Is one of two things for sure.
A coincidence, or a bad omen.
In a way, you need to get rid of it.
Why not just give it back to the sea monsters.
- A "G" idea.
- No way!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa...
- You're kidding!
- You're so selfish.
- Selfish?
Ok.
Maybe.
Just give me time to think about it.
But if I do give it back you're all coming with me.
Well.
We're right there, Aynsley.
We got some work to do.
Let's save all we can before is all lost to the sea.
How is he looking, mate?
They're taking over our beach.
He's pulling strange stuff out from the sea.
I suppose this means they're not leaving anytime soon, then.
Looks that way.
Do you see how the furry one sleeps all day while the big one does the work?
No, but I'll take your word for it.
I bet the sleeping one is the boss.
Look, he stripped off his skin.
I'm going to be sick.
None of us knew it at the time, but we were being watched by the real monsters on the island.
Some luck, May.
Their green gill human and his manking mock mating safety here.
How are we gonna deal with him he might be a problem for us.
Don't you worry...
I'll figure out a way to get rid of them quick enough.
For the time being we sit watch and wait.
Come on, May...
I'm starving here.
And cut to what I just say!
Sit... watch... and wait.
That's right, now stay focused.
We got the upper claw.
No one knows we're here... which means we take our time.
And we pick them off one by one.
Look, Aynsley...
this can come in very handy.
I gotta to practice before we venture out there to get our dinner, right boy?
♪ I ply my trade from the Union Jack!
♪
♪ Upon the seven seas ♪
♪ Unless I eat some rancid meat ♪
♪ Bury me soul where the mermaid please ♪
Steady!
What's he doing?
Back your hammer, and...
I don't know about you, Scrubby but I'm planning on stayting as far away from that monster as possible.
What was that all about?
I have absolutely no idea.
What we need to find out, is what these newcomers intentions are.
From the sound of it, they're up to no good.
- Obviously they're trying to kill us.
- Maybe, but maybe not.
The truth of the matter is that these new comers have brought nothing but trouble to our paradise that is a fact.
Fine, then do like I ask, and stay out of sight.
They're proof that there's another world out there and I'm going to find out whether they're friend or foe.
You really don't get it, do you?
That was close!
Ok, let's give this a go, one last time.
Did you see that, Aynsley?
!
I did it, I hit the mark!
Let's go fix something to eat, old boy.
That was a miracle, I'd never thought I'd hit it.
Well.
I can hit something after all.
I was starting to wonder if everyone wasn't right the new world was finally here... and I had no idea if I was ready for it or not.
Tapir's ready as I've ever seen.
Go for the throat, let's make this quick.
Wait, the human!
I can't do it, boy.
Go on!
Go!
What now?
Sorry, pal.
I've never shot anything before, why don't we try fishing.
What's burning?
That would be me.
You smell like bump biscuits.
Something is coming.
Looks like Rosie was here, that's strange...
Rosie never leaves any food behind.
Would you prefer light or dark meat for lunch, darling?
I prefer...
Dog!
Ready to get even, ratter!
Hold, Aynsley, I'm coming those blasted ratters, they did survive after all.
I'm hit!
Run for it!
Good dog!
You're alright, old boy?
Did you I hear that?
Over there!
It's a bird, a beautiful parrot.
Strangely, that's what all the fuss was about.
The ratters went after the bird.
You did good, old boy, and you, we're gonna fix you up straight away.
Look, Aynsley, a ring!
That can only mean one thing...
Sailors have sail for this island before.
I believe there's hope for us after all.
You can come out guys, there's no one around.
It's too dark, I can't see a thing.
This is the very spot where that sea monster attack me.
Well, sort of.
I've almost.
We shouldn't have let him go alone.
Maybe he's molting.
That's a bit of a stretch, Pango.
Just wait 'till I get my hooves on them!
Anyway you look at it, this is not good.
Mac can't be gone.
What's that?
And who are you two?
Just two homeless castaways we were held captive by that human for months with nothing to eat but the crumbs from his table.
What about our friend?
Did you see him by any chance?
It's a true tragedy, alright.
An unfortunate turn of events.
You see, we caught--
We saw the hosting.
Well, come on, let's hear it.
What are you waiting for?
We'll tell you what happened to your friend.
For I'm warning you, it ain't pretty.
You see, the human loves to eat birds and I'm afraid your friend got trapped.
This should only take a minute, It's just dislocated.
But, it's going to hurt, a bit.
Don't worry.
You´ll feel better in a day or two, though you won't be able to fly right away.
Well then, I suppose you'll need name if you're gonna stay here for a while.
Let's see, by my reckoning today is Tuesday that's a good a name as any, mate.
Can you say, Tuesday.
Tuesday.
Well, not quite, but that's a start.
Take care of our new friend, boy.
I'd better offload as much stuff as I can.
There's no telling how much the ship will stay in one piece.
- They're nothing but cannibals!
- Murderers.
I say we run him off our island drive them monsters back into the sea!
Perhaps a plan might be to force them to live on curse island.
Yes!
Oh, yes, yes, yes.
Curse Island.
What exactly is Curse Island?
The end of the earth, mate no one's ever made it back from there.
Yeah, there's nothing there but bugs.
Lots and lots of nasty bugs!
Sounds perfect... drive them to Curse island.
That's not gonna work.
You have a better idea?
No.
Right.
So then, where were we?
Stop your flapping about, bird.
You need to be resting that wing of yours.
What do you want from me?
I just want to talk.
Me name is Aynsley and for what I understand, yours is Tuesday.
Call me whatever you want, except dinner.
Dinner?
We're not going to eat you, we saved your life.
Either way, you don't make much of a meal.
Not like a fat, juicy turkey sweetheart back at home.
What?
Relax.
My master likes you.
You said, your master?
You did not think that I...
I like you, you're funny.
I've never seen a bird like you in England.
England.
Tell me more, Aynsley.
Well, buddy.
England, my island.
Just one fantastic place in a sea of many lands.
I knew it!
Crusoe wants to explore them all.
If we ever get off this one.
You know, you're the first to come from the outside world.
Oh, dear that's not good news.
Hey, hold on a second, we're all dress up like this because...?
Because you look fierce now get your heads in the game everyone.
We have the perfect opportunity, the dog and that bird are still on the ship.
Right.
Listen up!
Here's the plan we'll deal with the hairy beast on the ship.
The rest of you.
Go for the human on the beach.
What is ship?
That wooden thing on the beach.
As soon we're on the ship, "the wooden thing"...
- You attack!
- Alright then, fierce, fierce, fierce!
So, I'm a fierce coconut?
But I should go tell my friends that I'm ok.
You better stay put, you're in no condition to fly.
Well, look at this.
We can kill two birds with one stone.
There's two birds now?
No, shut it!
Just follow my lead.
Look, look!
That's him, brothers.
He's wearing Mac like a trophy.
That is so wrong!
Attack!
Let's get them.
Aynsley, we gotta go.
What's going on out there.
They've all got mad.
It appears as your friends have come to avenge your death.
I'm not dead!
Oh, we're gonna take care of that right now.
Aynsley!
Help!
I relieve you!
Aynsley!
Help!
Come on, down there and fight!
Aynsley!
Tuesday...!
- Hold on, that sounded like...
- Mac!
Aynsley!
- Mac, get out!
- Kiki!
Mac!
I'm coming, boy!
Rotten cats!
You are to blame for all this!
Gotta leave the ship, mate!
Go!
- Aynsley!
- Go!
What's happening here?
I thought Mac was dead.
We all did, but I don't think he made it this time.
That would be horrible.
Come on, guys, we better move back now.
Oh, no!
Aynsley, what have I done.
Land.
Land!
We're safe, mate, I thought we were goners.
Oh, will you just shut up!
- What's that noise?
- That would be bugs.
- Bugs!
- Curse Island!
Rest in peace, old boy.
Tuesday.
Mac!
Kiki!
Mac, you're hurt!
I'll be ok.
I'm sure glad to see you.
- I was worried.
- Me too.
Come on, now is your chance to get away.
- I can't.
- Well, let me help you.
No, no, I...
I just...
I don't... want to get away.
What?
You don't understand, is all those cats fault.
- What do you mean.
- They attacked me, he fixed my wing.
And his dog gave his life to save me.
I can't leave him now.
Oh, I see.
So, he's going to take care of you?
Look, he's gonna need my help to survive.
I owe him that.
Exactly, how do you plan on doing that?
I mean, look at him.
Tuesday!
Help!
I don't believe it those cats used us and Mac as well and what do we do?
We attacked the human.
Hold on, then.
So, what you're saying is Kiki's debrained fault on this?
Oh, fatal.
That's not fair, we all thought Mac was dead.
Didn't we?
Oh, this is not good, mate.
Yeah, we've made a real mess of things.
Looks that way, Epi gal.
Where are you going, Rosie?
I'm going to clean up our mess.
- I'm in!
- Let's get cracking then, mate.
Wait a second.
You're going to make an even bigger mess of things.
Wild beasts, they're going to get us!
Stay right where you are.
I've got a special treat for all of you.
I just wanted to give you some biscuits, that's all.
They're quite good.
I finished off your dog, human and I promise one day you and the rest of your lot will join him.
Now that, is the taste of desperation.
Try to get one, they taste just like chicken.
What, do you want to show me something?
Alright.
Alright, let's go!
Tuesday.
This... is fantastic.
Fresh water.
Good job, Tuesday.
What?
You want me to follow you?
Okay, I'm coming!
Hey guys, look who's here.
Relax, there's nothing to be afraid of.
Stay right where you are, I'll be right back.
What got into him, why is he running away?
- Beats me.
- Maybe it's your smell.
Try one of these, it's really good.
And some for you, enjoy.
So Tuesday, where's pretty bird.
- I haven't see her yet.
- Pretty bird.
You don't need to yell, Mac, I mean, Tuesday.
- I'm right here.
- Here you have pretty bird.
Here, do you see, I don't hurt you.
Come on, don't be afraid.
Come on, pretty bird.
Well, friendships aren't made in a day.
Taking one step at a time, right, Tuesday?
One step.
I can't, May, the current is too strong.
So, you failed again, did you?
Would you stop feeling sorry for yourself?
Oh, time will come.
Soon there will be more of us.
Revenge will be sweet.
That hurt.
Ah, you can't see a bloody thing, can you, old goat?
We're gonna have to fix that.
There you are.
That should help.
Why, Rosie, you're no pig.
Hey, what has gotten into you?
You're gorgeous?
Easy, big boy.
No, no, no, no, no.
Oh, no.
No!
Oh no.
Tuesday, help.
Hey, guys!
Nevermind.
This is hopeless.
How am I ever going to survive in this island?
Yes, of course, that's it!
I have to build a tree house!
It's raining tree limbs.
Is good enough to eat.
Is there anything you wouldn't eat?
Hey Pango, what's he doing?
Come on, mate, he's just bunkers on us.
He's destroying the tree.
I can't saw more.
Need to finish shelter, we must build.
Yes Sir, a whole porridge please.
We had no clue what Crusoe was up to.
Sawing.
Porridge.
Yep, as Pango would say, he was bonkers to the max.
Are you coming along, May.
Can I have just a little peak?
Can you just wait, I'm cleaning them up!
Well, could you at least tell me how big a litter we have?
More than we'll ever be able to feed, I'm afraid.
You look kittie.
That's smart.
I'm trying to work here, go eat somewhere else.
At this rate, I'll never get this built.
I told you, go!
Ah, nevermind.
What I wouldn't give for an extra set of hands.
For all his pounding and sawing we couldn't figure what he was actually doing.
What is going on?
- Really?
- I couldn't blame Rosie.
When you got an itch, you gotta scatch it.
The poor Crusoe he didn't see it that way.
He has had enough.
And that's when it hit me, a nest!
Hey, guys.
I've figured out what he was doing.
Making an ass?
No.
His building a shelter.
- We don't follow you, mate.
- He's building a nest.
- A nest?
- So he is a bird.
Scrubs.
He's building a human nest in the tree.
Pretty clever.
I've never slept in a tree.
If he stocks it with food, you'll sleep in a tree.
Good point, so guys, I got an idea...
What do you say we help him out.
Get this nest of his built.
I must've been crazy, thinking I can build all this by my self.
We didn't really have any idea what we were getting into.
We just figure let's help use whatever abilities we had and hoped it all worked.
I'll be gobsmacked.
Slowly, slowly.
Slowly, slowly.
That's it, just a little more.
Hi Epi, where are you headed with all that food?
I need a little help here, guys.
It tickles.
Not that kind of help.
No, no.
It tickles.
Epi, hold up, I'm starving!
Help!
Things didn't always go smoothly and we had our ups and downs.
That's for sure.
But everyone was in fine spirits and Crusoe seemed.
Well, happy.
He made a funny little door for Epi and Pango to get into the nest.
It was a pretty good idea.
After a few modifications that is.
We became a real team playing all these funny games Crusoe came up with.
He had all sorts of crazy ideas, oh, and hide and seek in the ground.
Crusoe had a funny way of eating, he peeled the fruit.
And boy did he eat slow.
It took quite a while but despite his ackwardness and all of his flaws Crusoe surprised even the most skeptical among us.
That's it, that's it, watch your step.
I've just put the finishing touches on our new home.
- New home.
- Hold it right there.
First thing we must do is christen the place.
It's good luck, you know.
I christen thee.
Oh, nevermind.
The preach is for us.
Wow!
Now look at that.
It's so beautiful.
Hip, hip, hooray!
What in the world is that noise he's making?
Sounds like Scrubby when he needs food.
It's painful, mate, let's get out of here.
Personally, I think it sounds beautiful.
A party and we weren't invited.
Now, could you come here?
I'm starving here!
Coming.
You know how difficult it is in my condition to hunt right now.
Have you tried to make it to the other island lately?
Oh May, you know the last time I'd tried I almost drowned!
I'm afraid we're just stuck with just the bugs and spiders.
They sound delicious.
Now go and hunt some up for me!
Right, darling.
I'll wrap them in seaweed just the way you like them.
With the nest completed, Crusoe moved on to a new project.
We didn't have to forage for food, we had this great nest and we even had indoor plumbing.
Paradise, just got better.
That human sure has made life peachy for us.
Rosie is sponsor to the max, I tell ye, old girl if this new world talks about this cookie it might not be that bad after all.
Getting a little plump, aren't we, sitting around all day?
Ain't nothing wrong with a few curves, Kiki honey.
With Crusoe doing the fishing... it would put the superb in you too in no time, Kiki.
What do we have here?
Looks like Crusoe is going to put your fish and scales to shame, Kiki.
As time passed, life became more and more confortable for us all.
Yet, Crusoe seemed very sad at times, he missed his old world.
He build a strange tower on the highest point of the island.
With bright lights burning every night.
Another day and no ship in sight, little fellow.
What I wouldn't give to see the sun set over the Thames.
Thames?
Come on, partner.
I don't get it...
Why does he light this thing every night?
In the hope that some other humans pass by.
If they see the signal, they'll come and rescue him.
I knew the chances of leaving this island would become slimmer as time went by.
I just didn't know how slim.
More humans on the island, that's not gonna happen.
And now my friends, like all good Englishman, a moment of silence.
To give thanks for this bountiful harvest.
Mind your manners.
Our host is...
Taking a snooze at the peers.
Ye he, he, or worse.
Hey, stop fooling around.
At least we're not out in that weather.
It's miserable out there.
Listen you guys... we're meant to live in the weather, have you'all gone soft.
Kiki, why get so worked up?
You haven's seen worked up, answer me this.
What happens to us when Crusoe leaves this island?
Have you thought of that.
Kiki, now, now, listen!
I'm listening!
I'm listening loud and clear, Mac!
Shall we eat!
If I could just find me some mussels!
One miscel little mussel.
It's mine, It's all mine!
Mine, mine, mine.
What´s yours!
Nothing.
You wouldn't be depriving your family!
Now, would you, sweetheart?
Yes.
I mean no.
Come here!
- Oh May, that hurts.
- Shame on you.
Look, the ship is falling apart.
Our luck is turning we'll be able to make it back to the main island after all.
Hey, let's say we go outside and have some fun on the water slide.
Great idea, I love all the smells after a good rain.
I'll catch with you guys later I better find Kiki first, make sure she's alright.
Why didn't that ship just vanish into the sea?
Our lives are never going to be the same again.
Show me that snack before we move on to the main island.
Help!
Scream all you want little bird.
No one is coming to save you now.
I'll be, the son of a seacook!
Watch out, children, is the human!
Get your filthy paws off my bird.
Epi, Pango.
To the left!
We have to get out of here quick!
Come on everyone!
We've got them surrounded!
Attack!
Kaboom!
Oh no!
He got me!
If this is heaven?
Why are you here?
They're heading for the big island.
They're everywhere!
It's all my fault.
We have to warn the others!
Get to the nest, now!
Hurry!
Predators!
- What?
- Did he say predators?
No.
Hang on everyone, I'll get my musket.
Batten down the hatches!
Batten down the hatches!
Weapons!
Gun powder!
Buckshot.
That's it, Tuesday!
Closes all.
They're everwhere!
Get off of me!
You bloody blasterds!
Ratters!
Tuesday!
- Help!
- Help!
Get me down from here!
I may not know humans, but they tend to be very angry.
Carmello!
Crusoe needs our help.
Look out!
Hurry, Epi!
Pango, over here!
Jump!
Stand back, Epi!
Hurry!
He's right behind you!
Go!
Go!
I need my musket!
Look what you've done.
You guys stay put!
Oh not, again!
Stay away you mange cats!
Hang on, Crusoe!
Good job, buddy.
Wasn't so bad!
Keep pushing!
I'll take care of these.
Pango!
Is awful high!
Come on, you can make it.
Jump!
Oh my... here, here it goes!
Good work!
Now, let's get out of here!
Ok!
So long, fur ball!
Hungry hour, well then take that!
Hakawa, Matata, Banana!
So long!
Scrubby, the door!
Come on!
Hello there!
Very glad, Scrubs!
Over here, Epi!
Hide in the bucket!
Going up!
Get off!
Get off!
Get off, you mengie cat!
Good Work, Epi!
They'll never get me!
We got rid of them, didn't we?
Epi!
Pango!
- Help me!
- Look up behind you, Epi!
Epi!
Let go of me!
The cats are trying to get in through the hatch!
No!
No.
Rosie no, that was Crusoe!
Let me get this open.
I hope you didn't hurt him.
- Everybody ok?
- Everybody except Crusoe.
Come on guys, all together, is heavy.
Spread out Rosie, we need all the muscle we can mass bulk.
- Really?
- Ok, ok.
One, two, three!
That's a bit of a bummer, mate.
We need Crusoe, how's he doing, Kiki?
He's alive, but he wont be of any use to us.
We're gonna need a miracle to hold on these cats back!
Got it, the musket.
Watch out guys, it's gonna be noisy.
Are you sure that's a good idea?
Is worth the try, what else can we do?
This is going to be easier than I thought.
The human's house, time to make our move.
Hurry, we can't hold them off much longer.
He always pulls that thing to the back first.
Ok, get ready.
That's weird.
What's happening in there?
Hey Tuesday, maybe this thing has something to do with it.
What thing?
Now what?
You know they're gonna come back.
Maybe Crusoe may come to and save us.
I hate to break it to you guys, we're on our own.
We have to get out of here.
Hide in some place.
What about Crusoe?
Pango's right, we can't leave him here.
Guys, guys, it may not be perfect.
But I think I got a plan.
Well you better lay it out cause we're out of time.
Alright children, calm down.
They just got lucky this time we're gonna sneak up on them and make them pay.
Now let's show them what we're made of.
Oh, yeah.
You got a broken wing, have you?
Don't worry, we'll put you out of your misery.
Stay back, or I'll shoot!
Not so brave now, are you?
Appears your luck has just run out.
You'll have to be quicker than that, ratter.
Get him, he can't fly!
That should take care of you quite nicely.
Sweet dreams from your favorite ratter.
Get ready!
We got them cornered, May.
Then let's finish him off once and for all.
Catch me if you can, ratter!
Hold on.
Rosie stop, we have to wait for the signal.
This is it, give it all you have, Rosie.
What's going on?
They tricked us.
Hold on to your fangs.
I'll trap this bird.
We're not so cocky anymore, are we?
Tuesday is in trouble.
That was a bossus plan you had there, mate!
Couldn't have done it without you guys!
The fire!
Crusoe!
Crusoe!
Over here!
That must've really hurt.
We boat Crusoe out to safety unconscious, but alive.
And then out of the blue we get cannon blasted from your ship.
The captain can be one tough bloke.
Expect!
They're pirates after all.
Pirates?
You know, like them nasty ratchets only worse.
A pack of crazed cats in my right I was sure I was a goner.
I took my musket in one hand my sword in the other and carved a swat to the savage hordes.
It was horrible, captain.
That is the most fantastical yarn I've heard in all me life.
This is no yarn, captain?
So ye say, well then, just trying to set sail you and your bird can take a bunk below.
Oh, Captain, I cannot tell you how I love to see England again.
England!
We'll not be sailing from them ports unless you want me to be hanging from the gallows.
Right dreamer.
But you see, me...
I must...
Can you at least drop me from a bit closer to home.
You're with us now.
Once a pirate, always a pirate.
Have you got a problem with that?
But Captain, if I might--
Enough talk!
Off with ya!
Then I'll be expecting you in the carrier you lad or you will be walking the plank you will, or worse.
Look!
Is it a mirage, May?
It's not another mirage, you idiot.
It's a ship.
Children, start paddling.
♪ I ply my trade from the Union Jack!
♪
♪ Upon the seven seas ♪
♪ And unless I eat some rancid meat-- ♪
Hey, give me here, is my rum you're be drinking!
Oh!
You want some rum, do ya?
How's me fisting ye instead!
These are some nasty pirates but it won't end well if I stay another moment.
Hey, what you be fixing to do that?
Oh, nothing, nothing at all.
Is that right?
The ingrate, we dawn rescue... from the island is trying to steal one of our rowboats.
If pretty boy is going to be stealing anything, I'd be us!
No, I was just--
Hey, what's going on out here?
Bosun, he's trying to jump ship!
Get him in throne little prick.
Alright, let's teach him a lesson, take that!
It escapes, go for him!
He's getting away!
Grab him!
Give me a piece of him!
There's no way out of this ship, you fool!
Get him!
He's mine!
I'm ready!
A raft!
Ye fools, shooting the wrong side of the man, come on men.
Show me what are ye be made of.
Bosun!
Get your scurby excuse for a pirate down to my cabin, now!
Aye, aye, Captain, right away!
And the rest of ye fools!
Back to work, before I give each ten lashes of me whip.
Disgusting bird!
Damn!
He's getting away!
Shall we send some men after him?
Neh, let him go.
Oh, Captain, can't we fire a cannon short blow them his misery!
Why waste a good cannonball let'm spend the rest of his life on that long forgotten island.
That is if a wild beast doesn't get him first.
Aye, aye, Captain!
It's been nice knowing ya, Ruf.
We did ourselves a good run man, didn't we, Cec?
Jump!
I wasn't going to let those ratters get ya, we friends gotta stick together.
Nice for you to think so.
Where are we heading off to then?
We're going home!

May Song dynasty endure 10,000 years.
Out of the way.
There were separate explosions.
Five rebels killed over 300 Mongols.
The injured number in the thousands.
- How long ago?
- Three days.
And we have no idea if there have been any more attacks?
I've augmented the number of scouts riding between the south and Cambulac, in the hopes of receiving word in a timelier fashion.
I will redirect our armies south.
Command them to attack hard and fast.
I'm not certain starting a war will ease tensions.
I said nothing of war.
I speak of complete annihilation.
Make a statement.
And I believe the last statement you made led us here.
The plan was for your army to accompany you to Xanadu as protection... and a show of force.
Realities change.
Plans change.
I stay.
To stamp out this insurrection.
As Vice Regent, you have entrusted me with your army.
Do so now.
I will not disappoint you.
Travel to Xanadu, Great Khan.
Make Kaidu regret his challenge to your throne.
Make them regret ever raising a hand in defiance to their Khan and Emperor.
You've overstepped your bounds.
If you seek power, find it elsewhere.
You have none here.
I do the bidding of the Khan, Ahmad.
My name is not Ahmad.
Not to you.
It is Vice Regent.
Attempt to undermine me or go behind my back...
Well...
You honor me, Great Khan.
And you dishonor me.
You want to be a tax collector.
This is your aspiration in life... when I offer you the Ministry of Finance?
In order to one day be of true service to the Empire,
I must first learn the fundamentals of finance.
Nonsense.
Since you were small, your aptitude with numbers has outshone men 20 years your senior.
Mmm.
And consorting with commoners will not further you in that regard.
Nor will living below your expectations.
And throwing our rewards back in our face.
To rule well, one must know the people he rules.
This is my goal... given me by my wise and powerful parents.
You are stubborn.
Which is good.
And clearly care nothing of the comforts I have provided you.
Which is good as well.
I respect your determination.
Do as you wish... but return to us a better man.
Yes, Father.
And do not think only of work and duty.
Explore the riches of my Silk Road.
Savor the local flavors
- when so inclined.
I'll miss you, son.
And I, you, Mother.
Hmm.
Kublai was on our land, surrounded by our army, your blade to his throat, and you let him ride away.
What was I to do?
Start an all-out war?
Slaughter him.
Slaughter his children.
Burn his city to the ground.
Rip the Khanate from him.
There would not have been a war.
It's because of your advice and my dim-witted son the chieftains will pledge their support to Kublai.
Take their support back.
Stop concerning yourself with an honorable victory.
Stop scrambling to name heirs.
I don't want it.
Give it to Orus.
I agree.
It will never happen, ever!
This is over.
Everyone but my daughter, out.
Get out.
I don't care what you want.
You will be the first female Khan of Mongolia.
I gave up everything for you.
My life... your mother.
That's not my burden.
Is this punishment?
For Byamba?
I think you wanted him to react the way he did.
You wanted him gone.
What purpose would that serve?
His support serviced my needs.
Don't remind me!
When I told you to get close to the Khan, you chose the path.
You chose Byamba, not me.
And you used it to your advantage.
Of course I did!
That's one of many reasons I will not be your heir.
I don't want to do things like that to the people I love.
And I won't allow you to do them to me.
You were supposed to get their votes, not uproot me!
Be careful with that!
-Promising me to others like a whore!
-Father--
Thanks to Genghis and his damned Kurultai, we travel hither and thither begging for approval.
- But, Sire--
- Judge me by my actions, and Kaidu by his.
- What he did to my sons.
- Father, if you just--
What's done is done.
We throw a banquet, have a hunt.
Smack the chieftains into line, return home, victory in hand.
Very wise, Father.
Don't.
Don't do that.
I want to be bitter.
I'm going to go.
Did you know about this?
You're going to make me read it?
It's Byamba's military assignment... as foot soldier.
You removed that from my desk.
-I did.
-You had no right.
- "Greetings, Great Khan."
- Apologies.
Greetings, Great Khan.
You requested I find a suitable station for him.
The men in his tumen do not trust him.
I thought working his way through the ranks might earn their respect once again.
Shouldn't Byamba travel with us?
Let the chieftains see he has abandoned Kaidu and stands with his father.
Having him by your side right now is not a good idea.
He's his son, Ahmad.
And they'll wonder whose side he'll cozy up to tomorrow.
Enough!
Both of you.
I asked him to find a position for Byamba.
He did.
Give him back his paper!
You'll be missed while we're in Xanadu.
Someone must watch over Cambulac.
- The quiet will allow me to convalesce.
- Hmm.
Find Nayan.
Send him to me.
You're concerned about his support?
No.
Never.
He was in Karakorum with Kaidu.
He's honorable.
Believes all men deserve a chance to be heard.
But he hates Kaidu.
Fortunate for us.
Yeah, but the other chieftains must hear him say it.
Nayan arrives here in three weeks.
Hmm.
It is auspicious timing, with Kublai headed to Xanadu.
You and I both know Nayan won't swear his allegiance to Kaidu.
Not willingly.
But given enough incentive... every man's will becomes flexible.
Gimping around the palace must... be a prerequisite for the duties of this office.
Be grateful you're alive.
I was dying in that shit-infested cave... and I thought of you.
I know that look.
All too well.
It's of a man trying to win my affections after he's already bought me.
I haven't paid you a thing.
You've paid me in the one thing no man has been able to.
Hope... for a future with my daughter.
Did you enjoy seeing her?
And... as your Empress.
I haven't chosen an Empress yet.
I will...
- ...be your Empress.
I thought we might hunt together in Xanadu.
I'm on a different kind of hunt.
Then may heaven help the south.
Form up!
You should be leading this tumen.
My father knows best.
Ahmad demoted you.
He serves my father.
Same difference.
I attempted to change the Khan's mind, but--
It's fine, Marco.
I imagine it's comforting to follow for a little while.
March, sleep, fight, kill.
Simple.
Move out!
This is where I can serve... what I do best, what I enjoy the most.
Oh, Bastard-Prince!
Or something like this.
If I take an arrow in the back, interrogate him before the Song, will you?
Take care of yourself, Byamba.
Take care of my father.
He has a report for you, my lord.
Get on with it.
My station is at the Princess' door.
We have many princesses.
Prince Jingim's recently seeded fourth wife.
And?
I escorted a stable hand into her bedroom... at an inappropriate hour, and... at Empress Chabi's command.
May I offer you a drink?
-Mother.
-Shh.
Auli Burkhan.
Apologies, Empress.
Auli Burkhan won't say the sex of the child.
Won't say?
Make her say.
--Auli Burkhan,
Auli Burkhan.
I'm sorry, Empress.
She sees nothing.
She sees nothing?
What does it mean, Mother?
It can take time to determine sex.
What if this baby isn't a boy?
What will happen then?
Nothing will happen.
It's a boy until proven otherwise.
Do you think she knows?
Who?
Knows what?
The bariyachi.
About the baby...
It isn't Jingim's.
Kokachin.
Sorry, Mother.
We'll speak of this baby only as a holy blessing and harbinger of joy.
Do you understand?
Yes, Mother.
There you are.
Here I am.
There's been an attack in the south.
Many were killed.
I have to send my army.
They won't be accompanying us to Xanadu as I'd hoped.
I'm not going to Xanadu.
You're not?
Kokachin shouldn't travel.
The pregnancy must not be risked.
My place is here with her.
And what of your husband?
What of him?
Have you no place by him?
My husband has no further need of my advice.
He has no further need of me.
Hello, Nergüi.
It's been a long time.
Lady Kokachin.
I was certain it was a mortal wound.
I would imagine so.
How else could you have managed this?
From peasant to princess overnight.
How did you survive?
A group of villagers found me.
They brought me to a shaman, and he somehow stemmed the bleeding.
I looked and looked for you.
But you were gone.
Not a trace.
Not a whisper.
Then I heard the news.
Prince Jingim is to wed the Blue Princess, last survivor of the Bayaut tribe.
That's how I found you.
And look at you.
You have everything a princess could ever want.
I want my life back.
Jingim's married to me.
This is my baby.
You found a way to take it.
Now find a way... to give it back.
If it flowed still... airag, or boal, or wine, or mead... no warrior could stop me.
I'd chase the Khanate as rabidly as my daughter runs from it.
Some are either too simple or too weak-willed to take what is theirs.
It isn't worth it.
I set out to have it on my own terms, and if I cannot, the Khanate is not worth it.
I can concede it.
I cannot concede my family.
And if I can give you both?
Just one more, son.
You bear the burden of a long line of weak and worthless men.
These demons must be drawn to the surface and expelled.
I'm not my father... nor his father...
I'm not my father.
Nor his father, or his father before him.
I'm not my father... nor his father... or his father before him.
Yet still so far from greatness.
May the impotent forefathers of the House of Ögödei
- be expelled from this broken vessel.
May the deer of the past become the wolves of the present.
Through your suffering... may you rise to wear the black sable of Genghis Khan.
Chaos.
A most wonderful weapon.
Only takes a little push to upend the cart.
Hundreds of Kublai's men are dead.
I wouldn't call that... a little push.
With his troops waging war in the south, the Khan is vulnerable.
Our forces will strike Kublai dead at a time of our choosing.
I have another problem.
What's that?
Marco.
He's in my affairs.
He's become a nuisance, and nuisances are the first to be swatted dead.
He seems beneath you, no?
Are you protecting him?
I'm lauding you.
Now... on your knees.
I can't.
Get up.
Look at me.
Perhaps you'll get rid of the Latin for me.
Perhaps I will.
But for now... let me take care of you.
You've got a funny face already!
So... hands up.
And then like this.
Master Ahmad.
You honor us.
I honored you with time.
I trust it's allowed you to fill your coffers.
Bad news, Master A.
We find ourselves here again?
Girls get sick.
Hazard of the occupation.
Patrons don't declare, and the girls are left to pay.
I'm all sympathy, Madame, but the debt won't hide itself in my ledgers.
Perhaps it could... if you were properly motivated.
You wish to spread disease as far as Cambulac?
These three are 100% guaranteed well.
Very well.
Fresh... and nimble.
Very highly skilled.
Well, that leaves us with number three.
Look... you're a match.
Very lucky.
Oksana it is, then.
Six tumen descend on the south, and are on pace to arrive and support their brothers in a week's time.
Sixty thousand men?
How many are left to escort me to Xanadu?
Seven mingghans, Sire.
Seven thousand are traveling with me?
That's not a show of force.
That's a party.
It is not a concern, Sire.
You will travel in safety.
Hmm.
When we have finished putting down the rebellion,
I will send everyone I can to Karakorum in time for the Kurultai.
-That's when you'll need them.
-Hmm.
Your mother has chosen to stay behind.
Pack up your whore.
She's coming to Xanadu with me.
My whore?
Mei Lin?
For all her faults as assassin and procreator of my enemies... she has an uncommon way of keeping my mind clear of late.
Sire.
Who's on your mind, Polo?
- Sanga.
Why would a long-dead taxman be vexing you now?
He worked for Ahmad.
And we never discovered who arranged for the assassination of Kublai.
Yusuf confessed in his own hand.
You don't believe that.
Continue with your speculation.
Ahmad ordered the entire army south, while the Khan rides north with little protection.
He advised execution of the Boy Emperor.
He demoted Byamba for no apparent reason.
He threatened my life.
He threatened your life?
Not in so many words, but... the implication was clear.
So you condemn Ahmad's innuendo, but pardon Yusuf's writing?
He is the Khan's son, raised from boyhood.
You are a foreigner, raised by nobody.
It's a feeling, Sifu.
And you've trained me to trust in them.
Should I simply ignore it?
Do nothing?
The sage acts by doing nothing.
You... are not a sage.
You shouldn't be here.
Before we returned to Cambulac, you thought the Emperor might die.
I presented it as a possibility.
You knew Ahmad would advise the Khan to execute that boy.
I knew no such thing.
It was an educated guess.
He wanted the boy dead.
Was it to incite war?
The Vice Regent doesn't share his political or military ruminations with the woman who tried to kill his mother.
You're lying.
You're too smart.
You've lived here too long not to have any insight.
When we returned from the south and stood before the Khan in the throne room... you spoke of my honor.
You defended me.
Now I wish to repay you.
Take your questions... take your suspicions... turn... and leave this place.
Dark days will soon be behind us.
The words of a fool.
Or of a man who has been filled with life by facing death.
Death faces us.
No matter how we try to look away.
Your optimism smooths the road ahead.
It's what makes us human... thinking we are administrators of the fates.
What's wrong?
Perhaps, talk to your husband.
He's never been interested in talking to me about anything that hasn't concerned him.
And now, not even that.
So that's why he's taking the whore with him to Xanadu... in your stead.
She's a second-rate replacement.
The Khan needs you more than anyone else... especially in this moment.
Hmm?
Remember that, Mother.
- How long have I slept?
- An hour.
I must get back to work.
Just relax.
I'm glad you rested.
You needed it.
I like taking care of you.
- You're from the kingdom of Bukhara, yes?
I am.
What village?
There's nothing left of them now.
Your family?
Gone.
You mean dead?
What's the difference in the end?
My husband, my little boy... they're dead... at the hands of your master.
He put me here.
I wasn't good enough for his harem, so he sold me off to this place.
At the time I was scared... angry, alone.
And then I realized, I wasn't alone.
They're here with me.
Inside.
Always.
Surely, you have good memories, huh?
That song... how do you know it?
I wrote it... for my baby boy.
--Did you fuck the Khan?
-Get your hands off me.
-Did you fuck him?
Remove them or I will.
What would you have had me do?
Deny him?
-Why didn't you tell me?
-Is that what maddens you... lack of information?
Not the fact that he stained my body with his sweat and seed?
All of it maddens me!
If we're taking this opportunity... to unburden ourselves of our lies of omission... well, I have one to share.
Your daughter will no longer reside in the House of Kublai.
For in the days ahead...
I will use her as a bargaining chip.
Bargaining chip for whom?
- Who?
For a man... with a predilection for unsoiled flesh.
For a man who can tip the scales of this Kurultai... in any direction I please.
Nayan.
My daughter is Nayan's incentive.
You attempt to wound me?
Ahmad... this is everything we've ever wanted.
There is no worse man... for my daughter to be enslaved to than the Khan.
And if this is what it takes to ensure he falls... so be it.
I believed you.
I actually believed, for a second, that you would sell your most valuable possession.
You're talented, Mei Lin... but not that talented.
Hey, boy, give me some water.
You're headed west?
That's right.
Coming from Quinsai?
Yeah.
Enough!
No time for bathing, Bastard-Prince.
We have a war to fight.
Move out!
Yes, sir.
I want to water my horse.
That water belongs to the Khan, Kublai...
Princess.
Are you ready to listen to your mother?
Yes.
- I've fulfilled my part of the bargain.
Time for you to do the same.
I need to adjust our agreement.
-Is that so?
-My daughter resides within these walls... in the palace of the Empress.
Find her, spirit her away, and I will deliver the monk.
Give me the monk... or I kill you.
I will find your daughter... and I will kill her too.
Follow me.
It was here.
You shouldn't be here.
You must leave now.
What was here?
Why did you bring me here?
What do I need to know?
Only that you shouldn't be here.
The bariyachi has declared Kokachin safe for travel.
We are all going to Xanadu... together.
Oh!
That's wonderful news.
Never again.
Long live the Khan!
-Long live the Khan!
-Long live the Khan!
Life harder on the road than you expected?
On the contrary, Sire.
It proved eye-opening in ways I'd never dreamt.
Does this mean we'll lose you forever to the allure of my Silk Road?
Actually, Sire, if you would still consider it...
I would like to accept the position you offered previously in the Finance Ministry.
Ah!
Your nose has been opened, huh?
I learned much about the lives of your subjects.
I realize just how much more effective I can be... by your side.
You know what this means, son?
You finally feel worthy of the power I offer you.
I believe I do.
May Song dynasty endure 10,000 years.
Out of the way.

You've paid me in the one thing no man has been able to.
Hope... for a future with my daughter.
Did you enjoy seeing her?
And... as your Empress.
I haven't chosen an Empress yet.
I will...
- ...be your Empress.
I thought we might hunt together in Xanadu.
I'm on a different kind of hunt.
Then may heaven help the south.
Form up!
You should be leading this tumen.
My father knows best.
Ahmad demoted you.
He serves my father.
Same difference.
I attempted to change the Khan's mind, but...
It's fine, Marco.
I imagine it's comforting to follow for a little while.
March, sleep, fight, kill.
Simple.
Move out!
This is where I can serve... what I do best, what I enjoy the most.
Oh, Bastard-Prince!
Or something like this.
If I take an arrow in the back, interrogate him before the Song, will you?
Take care of yourself, Byamba.
Take care of my father.
He has a report for you, my lord.
Get on with it.
My station is at the Princess' door.
We have many princesses.
Prince Jingim's recently seeded fourth wife.
And?
I escorted a stable hand into her bedroom... at an inappropriate hour, and... at Empress Chabi's command.
May I offer you a drink?
-Mother.
-Shh.
Auli Burkhan.
Apologies, Empress.
Auli Burkhan won't say the sex of the child.
Won't say?
Make her say.
...Auli Burkhan,
Auli Burkhan.
I'm sorry, Empress.
She sees nothing.
She sees nothing?
What does it mean, Mother?
It can take time to determine sex.
What if this baby isn't a boy?
What will happen then?
Nothing will happen.
It's a boy until proven otherwise.
Do you think she knows?
Who?
Knows what?
The bariyachi.
About the baby...
It isn't Jingim's.
Kokachin.
Sorry, Mother.
We'll speak of this baby only as a holy blessing and harbinger of joy.
Do you understand?
Yes, Mother.
There you are.
Here I am.
There's been an attack in the south.
Many were killed.
I have to send my army.
They won't be accompanying us to Xanadu as I'd hoped.
I'm not going to Xanadu.
You're not?
Kokachin shouldn't travel.
The pregnancy must not be risked.
My place is here with her.
And what of your husband?
What of him?
Have you no place by him?
My husband has no further need of my advice.
He has no further need of me.
Hello, Nergüi.
It's been a long time.
Lady Kokachin.
I was certain it was a mortal wound.
I would imagine so.
How else could you have managed this?
From peasant to princess overnight.
How did you survive?
A group of villagers found me.
They brought me to a shaman, and he somehow stemmed the bleeding.
I looked and looked for you.
But you were gone.
Not a trace.
Not a whisper.
Then I heard the news.
Prince Jingim is to wed the Blue Princess, last survivor of the Bayaut tribe.
That's how I found you.
And look at you.
You have everything a princess could ever want.
I want my life back.
Jingim's married to me.
This is my baby.
You found a way to take it.
Now find a way... to give it back.
If it flowed still... airag, or boal, or wine, or mead... no warrior could stop me.
I'd chase the Khanate as rabidly as my daughter runs from it.
Some are either too simple or too weak-willed to take what is theirs.
It isn't worth it.
I set out to have it on my own terms, and if I cannot, the Khanate is not worth it.
I can concede it.
I cannot concede my family.
And if I can give you both?
Just one more, son.
You bear the burden of a long line of weak and worthless men.
These demons must be drawn to the surface and expelled.
I'm not my father... nor his father...
I'm not my father.
Nor his father, or his father before him.
I'm not my father... nor his father... or his father before him.
Yet still so far from greatness.
May the impotent forefathers of the House of Ögödei
- be expelled from this broken vessel.
May the deer of the past become the wolves of the present.
Through your suffering... may you rise to wear the black sable of Genghis Khan.
Chaos.
A most wonderful weapon.
Only takes a little push to upend the cart.
Hundreds of Kublai's men are dead.
I wouldn't call that... a little push.
With his troops waging war in the south, the Khan is vulnerable.
Our forces will strike Kublai dead at a time of our choosing.
I have another problem.
What's that?
Marco.
He's in my affairs.
He's become a nuisance, and nuisances are the first to be swatted dead.
He seems beneath you, no?
Are you protecting him?
I'm lauding you.
Now... on your knees.
I can't.
Get up.
Look at me.
Perhaps you'll get rid of the Latin for me.
Perhaps I will.
But for now... let me take care of you.
You've got a funny face already!
So... hands up.
And then like this.
Master Ahmad.
You honor us.
I honored you with time.
I trust it's allowed you to fill your coffers.
Bad news, Master A.
We find ourselves here again?
Girls get sick.
Hazard of the occupation.
Patrons don't declare, and the girls are left to pay.
I'm all sympathy, Madame, but the debt won't hide itself in my ledgers.
Perhaps it could... if you were properly motivated.
You wish to spread disease as far as Cambulac?
These three are 100% guaranteed well.
Very well.
Fresh... and nimble.
Very highly skilled.
Well, that leaves us with number three.
Look... you're a match.
Very lucky.
Oksana it is, then.
Six tumen descend on the south, and are on pace to arrive and support their brothers in a week's time.
Sixty thousand men?
How many are left to escort me to Xanadu?
Seven mingghans, Sire.
Seven thousand are traveling with me?
That's not a show of force.
That's a party.
It is not a concern, Sire.
You will travel in safety.
Hmm.
When we have finished putting down the rebellion,
I will send everyone I can to Karakorum in time for the Kurultai.
-That's when you'll need them.
-Hmm.
Your mother has chosen to stay behind.
Pack up your whore.
She's coming to Xanadu with me.
My whore?
Mei Lin?
For all her faults as assassin and procreator of my enemies... she has an uncommon way of keeping my mind clear of late.
Sire.
Who's on your mind, Polo?
- Sanga.
Why would a long-dead taxman be vexing you now?
He worked for Ahmad.
And we never discovered who arranged for the assassination of Kublai.
Yusuf confessed in his own hand.
You don't believe that.
Continue with your speculation.
Ahmad ordered the entire army south, while the Khan rides north with little protection.
He advised execution of the Boy Emperor.
He demoted Byamba for no apparent reason.
He threatened my life.
He threatened your life?
Not in so many words, but... the implication was clear.
So you condemn Ahmad's innuendo, but pardon Yusuf's writing?
He is the Khan's son, raised from boyhood.
You are a foreigner, raised by nobody.
It's a feeling, Sifu.
And you've trained me to trust in them.
Should I simply ignore it?
Do nothing?
The sage acts by doing nothing.
You... are not a sage.
You shouldn't be here.
Before we returned to Cambulac, you thought the Emperor might die.
I presented it as a possibility.
You knew Ahmad would advise the Khan to execute that boy.
I knew no such thing.
It was an educated guess.
He wanted the boy dead.
Was it to incite war?
The Vice Regent doesn't share his political or military ruminations with the woman who tried to kill his mother.
You're lying.
You're too smart.
You've lived here too long not to have any insight.
When we returned from the south and stood before the Khan in the throne room... you spoke of my honor.
You defended me.
Now I wish to repay you.
Take your questions... take your suspicions... turn... and leave this place.
Dark days will soon be behind us.
The words of a fool.
Or of a man who has been filled with life by facing death.
Death faces us.
No matter how we try to look away.
Your optimism smooths the road ahead.
It's what makes us human... thinking we are administrators of the fates.
What's wrong?
Perhaps, talk to your husband.
He's never been interested in talking to me about anything that hasn't concerned him.
And now, not even that.
So that's why he's taking the whore with him to Xanadu... in your stead.
She's a second-rate replacement.
The Khan needs you more than anyone else... especially in this moment.
Hmm?
Remember that, Mother.
- How long have I slept?
- An hour.
I must get back to work.
Just relax.
I'm glad you rested.
You needed it.
I like taking care of you.
- You're from the kingdom of Bukhara, yes?
I am.
What village?
There's nothing left of them now.
Your family?
Gone.
You mean dead?
What's the difference in the end?
My husband, my little boy... they're dead... at the hands of your master.
He put me here.
I wasn't good enough for his harem, so he sold me off to this place.
At the time I was scared... angry, alone.
And then I realized, I wasn't alone.
They're here with me.
Inside.
Always.
Surely, you have good memories, huh?
That song... how do you know it?
I wrote it... for my baby boy.
...Did you fuck the Khan?
-Get your hands off me.
-Did you fuck him?
Remove them or I will.
What would you have had me do?
Deny him?
-Why didn't you tell me?
-Is that what maddens you... lack of information?
Not the fact that he stained my body with his sweat and seed?
All of it maddens me!
If we're taking this opportunity... to unburden ourselves of our lies of omission... well, I have one to share.
Your daughter will no longer reside in the House of Kublai.
For in the days ahead...
I will use her as a bargaining chip.
Bargaining chip for whom?
- Who?
For a man... with a predilection for unsoiled flesh.
For a man who can tip the scales of this Kurultai... in any direction I please.
Nayan.
My daughter is Nayan's incentive.
You attempt to wound me?
Ahmad... this is everything we've ever wanted.
There is no worse man... for my daughter to be enslaved to than the Khan.
And if this is what it takes to ensure he falls... so be it.
I believed you.
I actually believed, for a second, that you would sell your most valuable possession.
You're talented, Mei Lin... but not that talented.
Hey, boy, give me some water.
You're headed west?
That's right.
Coming from Quinsai?
Yeah.
Enough!
No time for bathing, Bastard-Prince.
We have a war to fight.
Move out!
Yes, sir.
I want to water my horse.
That water belongs to the Khan, Kublai...
Princess.
Are you ready to listen to your mother?
Yes.
- I've fulfilled my part of the bargain.
Time for you to do the same.
I need to adjust our agreement.
-Is that so?
-My daughter resides within these walls... in the palace of the Empress.
Find her, spirit her away, and I will deliver the monk.
Give me the monk... or I kill you.
I will find your daughter... and I will kill her too.
Follow me.
It was here.
You shouldn't be here.
You must leave now.
What was here?
Why did you bring me here?
What do I need to know?
Only that you shouldn't be here.
The bariyachi has declared Kokachin safe for travel.
We are all going to Xanadu... together.
Oh!
That's wonderful news.
Never again.
Long live the Khan!
-Long live the Khan!
-Long live the Khan!
Life harder on the road than you expected?
On the contrary, Sire.
It proved eye-opening in ways I'd never dreamt.
Does this mean we'll lose you forever to the allure of my Silk Road?
Actually, Sire, if you would still consider it...
I would like to accept the position you offered previously in the Finance Ministry.
Ah!
Your nose has been opened, huh?
I learned much about the lives of your subjects.
I realize just how much more effective I can be... by your side.
You know what this means, son?
You finally feel worthy of the power I offer you.
I believe I do.
Resync by CyberPunk
[faint indistinct chatter]
May Song dynasty endure 10,000 years.
[indistinct chatter]
[soldier] Out of the way.
[soldier speaking Mongolian]
[laughter]
[overlapping chatter]
[people screaming]
[theme music playing]
There were separate explosions.
Five rebels killed over 300 Mongols.
The injured number in the thousands.
-How long ago?
-[Ahmad] Three days.
And we have no idea if there have been any more attacks?
I've augmented the number of scouts riding between the south and Cambulac, in the hopes of receiving word in a timelier fashion.
I will redirect our armies south.
Command them to attack hard and fast.
I'm not certain starting a war will ease tensions.
I said nothing of war.
I speak of complete annihilation.
Make a statement.
And I believe the last statement you made led us here.
The plan was for your army to accompany you to Xanadu as protection... and a show of force.
[Kublai] Realities change.
Plans change.
I stay.
To stamp out this insurrection.
As Vice Regent, you have entrusted me with your army.
Do so now.
I will not disappoint you.
Travel to Xanadu, Great Khan.
Make Kaidu regret his challenge to your throne.
Make them regret ever raising a hand in defiance to their Khan and Emperor.
[grunts]
You've overstepped your bounds.
If you seek power, find it elsewhere.
You have none here.
I do the bidding of the Khan, Ahmad.
My name is not Ahmad.
Not to you.
It is Vice Regent.
Attempt to undermine me or go behind my back...
Well...
[Ahmad] You honor me, Great Khan.
And you dishonor me.
You want to be a tax collector.
This is your aspiration in life... when I offer you the Ministry of Finance?
In order to one day be of true service to the Empire,
I must first learn the fundamentals of finance.
[Chabi] Nonsense.
Since you were small, your aptitude with numbers has outshone men 20 years your senior.
[Kublai] Mmm.
And consorting with commoners will not further you in that regard.
Nor will living below your expectations.
And throwing our rewards back in our face.
[Ahmad] To rule well, one must know the people he rules.
This is my goal... given me by my wise and powerful parents.
[Chabi chuckles] [grunts] You are stubborn.
Which is good.
And clearly care nothing of the comforts I have provided you.
Which is good as well.
I respect your determination.
Do as you wish... but return to us a better man.
Yes, Father.
And do not think only of work and duty.
Explore the riches of my Silk Road.
Savor the local flavors
-when so inclined.
-[chuckles] [sighs]
I'll miss you, son.
And I, you, Mother.
[Kublai chuckling]
Hmm.
[sheep bleating]
[Shabkana] Kublai was on our land, surrounded by our army, your blade to his throat, and you let him ride away.
What was I to do?
Start an all-out war?
Slaughter him.
Slaughter his children.
Burn his city to the ground.
Rip the Khanate from him.
There would not have been a war.
It's because of your advice and my dim-witted son the chieftains will pledge their support to Kublai.
Take their support back.
Stop concerning yourself with an honorable victory.
Stop scrambling to name heirs.
I don't want it.
Give it to Orus.
I agree.
It will never happen, ever!
This is over.
Everyone but my daughter, out.
Get out.
I don't care what you want.
You will be the first female Khan of Mongolia.
I gave up everything for you.
My life... your mother.
That's not my burden.
Is this punishment?
For Byamba?
I think you wanted him to react the way he did.
You wanted him gone.
What purpose would that serve?
His support serviced my needs.
Don't remind me!
When I told you to get close to the Khan, you chose the path.
You chose Byamba, not me.
And you used it to your advantage.
Of course I did!
That's one of many reasons I will not be your heir.
I don't want to do things like that to the people I love.
And I won't allow you to do them to me.
You were supposed to get their votes, not uproot me!
Be careful with that!
-Promising me to others like a whore!
-Father--
Thanks to Genghis and his damned Kurultai, we travel hither and thither begging for approval.
-[Marco] But, Sire--
-Judge me by my actions, and Kaidu by his.
-What he did to my sons.
-[Jingim] Father, if you just--
What's done is done.
We throw a banquet, have a hunt.
Smack the chieftains into line, return home, victory in hand.
[sighs] Very wise, Father.
Don't.
Don't do that.
I want to be bitter.
[sighs]
I'm going to go.
[sighs]
Did you know about this?
You're going to make me read it?
It's Byamba's military assignment... as foot soldier.
You removed that from my desk.
-I did.
-You had no right.
-"Greetings, Great Khan." -[Ahmad] Apologies.
Greetings, Great Khan.
[grunts]
[Ahmad] You requested I find a suitable station for him.
The men in his tumen do not trust him.
I thought working his way through the ranks might earn their respect once again.
Shouldn't Byamba travel with us?
Let the chieftains see he has abandoned Kaidu and stands with his father.
Having him by your side right now is not a good idea.
He's his son, Ahmad.
And they'll wonder whose side he'll cozy up to tomorrow.
Enough!
Both of you.
I asked him to find a position for Byamba.
He did.
Give him back his paper!
[grunts]
[Kublai] You'll be missed while we're in Xanadu.
Someone must watch over Cambulac.
-The quiet will allow me to convalesce.
-[Kublai] Hmm.
Find Nayan.
Send him to me.
You're concerned about his support?
No.
Never.
He was in Karakorum with Kaidu.
He's honorable.
Believes all men deserve a chance to be heard.
[chuckles]
But he hates Kaidu.
Fortunate for us.
Yeah, but the other chieftains must hear him say it.
Nayan arrives here in three weeks.
[Mei Lin] Hmm.
It is auspicious timing, with Kublai headed to Xanadu.
You and I both know Nayan won't swear his allegiance to Kaidu.
Not willingly.
But given enough incentive... every man's will becomes flexible.
[wincing] [grunts]
[sighs]
Gimping around the palace must... be a prerequisite for the duties of this office.
Be grateful you're alive.
I was dying in that shit-infested cave... and I thought of you.
I know that look.
All too well.
It's of a man trying to win my affections after he's already bought me.
I haven't paid you a thing.
You've paid me in the one thing no man has been able to.
Hope... for a future with my daughter.
Did you enjoy seeing her?
And... as your Empress.
I haven't chosen an Empress yet.
I will... [grunts]
-...be your Empress.
-[sighs] [indistinct chatter]
I thought we might hunt together in Xanadu.
I'm on a different kind of hunt.
Then may heaven help the south.
Form up!
[sighs] You should be leading this tumen.
My father knows best.
Ahmad demoted you.
He serves my father.
Same difference.
I attempted to change the Khan's mind, but--
It's fine, Marco.
I imagine it's comforting to follow for a little while.

This is where I can serve... what I do best, what I enjoy the most.
[Kasar] Oh, Bastard-Prince!
[Byamba] Or something like this.
If I take an arrow in the back, interrogate him before the Song, will you?
[chuckles] Take care of yourself, Byamba.
Take care of my father.
[door opening]
He has a report for you, my lord.
Get on with it.
My station is at the Princess' door.
We have many princesses.
Prince Jingim's recently seeded fourth wife.
And?
[guard] I escorted a stable hand into her bedroom... at an inappropriate hour, and... at Empress Chabi's command.
May I offer you a drink?
[bariyachi humming]
-Mother.
-Shh.
[humming continues]
[thunder rumbles]
Auli Burkhan.
[sighs]
Apologies, Empress.
Auli Burkhan won't say the sex of the child.
[Chabi] Won't say?
Make her say.
-[thunder rumbles] -[chanting] Auli Burkhan,
Auli Burkhan.
I'm sorry, Empress.
She sees nothing.
She sees nothing?
What does it mean, Mother?
It can take time to determine sex.
What if this baby isn't a boy?
What will happen then?
Nothing will happen.
It's a boy until proven otherwise.
Do you think she knows?
Who?
Knows what?
The bariyachi.
About the baby...
It isn't Jingim's.
[gasps]
Kokachin.
Sorry, Mother.
We'll speak of this baby only as a holy blessing and harbinger of joy.
Do you understand?
Yes, Mother.
There you are.
[breathes deeply]
Here I am.
There's been an attack in the south.
Many were killed.
I have to send my army.
They won't be accompanying us to Xanadu as I'd hoped.
I'm not going to Xanadu.
You're not?
Kokachin shouldn't travel.
The pregnancy must not be risked.
My place is here with her.
And what of your husband?
[Chabi] What of him?
Have you no place by him?
[Chabi sighs]
My husband has no further need of my advice.
He has no further need of me.

[birds chirping]
-[bird cawing] -[gasping]
Hello, Nergüi.

I can concede it.
I cannot concede my family.
And if I can give you both?
[rhythmic drumming]
Just one more, son.
You bear the burden of a long line of weak and worthless men.
These demons must be drawn to the surface and expelled.
[grunts]
[bird cawing]
I'm not my father... nor his father...
I'm not my father.
[softly] Nor his father, or his father before him.
I'm not my father... nor his father... or his father before him.
Yet still so far from greatness.
May the impotent forefathers of the House of Ögödei
-be expelled from this broken vessel.
-[eagle screeching]
May the deer of the past become the wolves of the present.
Through your suffering... may you rise to wear the black sable of Genghis Khan.
Chaos.
A most wonderful weapon.
Only takes a little push to upend the cart.
[Mei Lin] Hundreds of Kublai's men are dead.
I wouldn't call that... a little push.
[Ahmad] With his troops waging war in the south, the Khan is vulnerable.
Our forces will strike Kublai dead at a time of our choosing.
I have another problem.
What's that?

[exclaims] You've got a funny face already!
So... hands up.
And then like this.
[children laughing]
[Orqina] Master Ahmad.
You honor us.
I honored you with time.
I trust it's allowed you to fill your coffers.
[clicks tongue] [sighs] Bad news, Master A.
We find ourselves here again?
[Orqina] Girls get sick.
Hazard of the occupation.
Patrons don't declare, and the girls are left to pay.
I'm all sympathy, Madame, but the debt won't hide itself in my ledgers.
Perhaps it could... if you were properly motivated.
[claps]

When we returned from the south and stood before the Khan in the throne room... you spoke of my honor.
You defended me.
Now I wish to repay you.
Take your questions... take your suspicions... turn... and leave this place.
[sighing]
Dark days will soon be behind us.
[chuckles] The words of a fool.
Or of a man who has been filled with life by facing death.
Death faces us. [sighing]
No matter how we try to look away.
Your optimism smooths the road ahead.
[sighs heavily]
It's what makes us human... thinking we are administrators of the fates. [sighs]
What's wrong?
Perhaps, talk to your husband.
[inhales] He's never been interested in talking to me about anything that hasn't concerned him.
[sighing] And now, not even that.
So that's why he's taking the whore with him to Xanadu... in your stead.
She's a second-rate replacement.
[inhales sharply]
The Khan needs you more than anyone else... especially in this moment.
Hmm?
Remember that, Mother.
[sighs]
[Ahmad and Oksana panting]
[Ahmad grunts]
[faint indistinct chatter]
[breathes deeply]
-[sighing] How long have I slept?
-An hour.
[inhales] I must get back to work.
Just relax.
[sighs]
I'm glad you rested.
You needed it.
I like taking care of you.
-You're from the kingdom of Bukhara, yes?
-[breathes deeply]
I am.
What village?
There's nothing left of them now.
Your family?
Gone.
You mean dead?
[scoffs]
What's the difference in the end?
My husband, my little boy... they're dead... at the hands of your master.
He put me here.
I wasn't good enough for his harem, so he sold me off to this place.
At the time I was scared... angry, alone.
And then I realized, I wasn't alone.
They're here with me.
Inside.
Always.
Surely, you have good memories, huh?
[Oksana humming]
[humming continues]
That song... how do you know it?
I wrote it... for my baby boy.
[Oksana continues humming]
-[grunts]
-Did you fuck the Khan?
-Get your hands off me.
-Did you fuck him?
Remove them or I will.
[breathing heavily] [groans]
What would you have had me do?
Deny him?
-Why didn't you tell me?
-Is that what maddens you... lack of information?
Not the fact that he stained my body with his sweat and seed?
All of it maddens me!
If we're taking this opportunity... to unburden ourselves of our lies of omission... well, I have one to share.
Your daughter will no longer reside in the House of Kublai.
For in the days ahead...
I will use her as a bargaining chip.
Bargaining chip for whom?
-Who?
-[groans] [groans] [panting] For a man... with a predilection for unsoiled flesh.
For a man who can tip the scales of this Kurultai... in any direction I please.
Nayan.
My daughter is Nayan's incentive.
[Ahmad breathing heavily]
[Ahmad grunts]
You attempt to wound me?
Ahmad... this is everything we've ever wanted.
There is no worse man... for my daughter to be enslaved to than the Khan.
And if this is what it takes to ensure he falls... so be it.
[inhales] I believed you.
I actually believed, for a second, that you would sell your most valuable possession.
You're talented, Mei Lin... but not that talented.
[indistinct clamoring]
[soldier] Hey, boy, give me some water.
[horse neighing]
You're headed west?
[man] That's right.
[Byamba] Coming from Quinsai?
[man] Yeah.
[straining]
-[gasping] -[soldiers laughing]
[Kasar] Enough!
No time for bathing, Bastard-Prince.
[soldiers laughing]
[Kasar] We have a war to fight.
Move out!
[indistinct chatter]
Yes, sir.
[indistinct chatter] [both laughing]
[laughing continues]
I want to water my horse.
That water belongs to the Khan, Kublai...
Princess.
[grunts]
[grunting] [groans]
[groans]
[groans]

Are you ready to listen to your mother?
Yes.
-I've fulfilled my part of the bargain.
-[gasps]
Time for you to do the same.
I need to adjust our agreement.
-Is that so?
-My daughter resides within these walls... in the palace of the Empress.
Find her, spirit her away, and I will deliver the monk.
Give me the monk... or I kill you.
I will find your daughter... and I will kill her too.
[Hundred Eyes grunts]
Follow me.
[gasps]
It was here.
You shouldn't be here.
You must leave now.
What was here?
Why did you bring me here?
What do I need to know?
Only that you shouldn't be here.
The bariyachi has declared Kokachin safe for travel.
We are all going to Xanadu... together.
Oh!
That's wonderful news.
Never again.
[crowd shouting] Long live the Khan!
-Long live the Khan!
-Long live the Khan!
[inaudible]
[gasps]
[coughs]
Life harder on the road than you expected?
On the contrary, Sire.
It proved eye-opening in ways I'd never dreamt.
[chuckling]
Does this mean we'll lose you forever to the allure of my Silk Road?
Actually, Sire, if you would still consider it...
I would like to accept the position you offered previously in the Finance Ministry.
Ah!
Your nose has been opened, huh?
I learned much about the lives of your subjects.
I realize just how much more effective I can be... by your side.
[grunts]
You know what this means, son?
You finally feel worthy of the power I offer you.
I believe I do.
[somber music playing]

Resync by CyberPunk
There were separate explosions.
Five rebels killed over 300 Mongols.
The injured number in the thousands.
-How long ago?
-[Ahmad] Three days.
And we have no idea if there have been any more attacks?
I've augmented the number of scouts riding between the south and Cambulac, in the hopes of receiving word in a timelier fashion.
I will redirect our armies south.
Command them to attack hard and fast.
I'm not certain starting a war will ease tensions.
I said nothing of war.
I speak of complete annihilation.
Make a statement.
And I believe the last statement you made led us here.
The plan was for your army to accompany you to Xanadu as protection... and a show of force.
[Kublai] Realities change.
Plans change.
I stay.
To stamp out this insurrection.
As Vice Regent, you have entrusted me with your army.
Do so now.
I will not disappoint you.
Travel to Xanadu, Great Khan.
Make Kaidu regret his challenge to your throne.
Make them regret ever raising a hand in defiance to their Khan and Emperor.
[grunts]
You've overstepped your bounds.
If you seek power, find it elsewhere.
You have none here.
I do the bidding of the Khan, Ahmad.
My name is not Ahmad.
Not to you.
It is Vice Regent.
Attempt to undermine me or go behind my back...
Well...
[Ahmad] You honor me, Great Khan.
And you dishonor me.
You want to be a tax collector.
This is your aspiration in life... when I offer you the Ministry of Finance?
In order to one day be of true service to the Empire,
I must first learn the fundamentals of finance.
[Chabi] Nonsense.
Since you were small, your aptitude with numbers has outshone men 20 years your senior.
[Kublai] Mmm.
And consorting with commoners will not further you in that regard.
Nor will living below your expectations.
And throwing our rewards back in our face.
[Ahmad] To rule well, one must know the people he rules.
This is my goal... given me by my wise and powerful parents.
[Chabi chuckles] [grunts] You are stubborn.
Which is good.
And clearly care nothing of the comforts I have provided you.
Which is good as well.
I respect your determination.
Do as you wish... but return to us a better man.
Yes, Father.
And do not think only of work and duty.
Explore the riches of my Silk Road.
Savor the local flavors
-when so inclined.
-[chuckles] [sighs]
I'll miss you, son.
And I, you, Mother.
[Kublai chuckling]
Hmm.
[sheep bleating]
[Shabkana] Kublai was on our land, surrounded by our army, your blade to his throat, and you let him ride away.
What was I to do?
Start an all-out war?
Slaughter him.
Slaughter his children.
Burn his city to the ground.
Rip the Khanate from him.
There would not have been a war.
It's because of your advice and my dim-witted son the chieftains will pledge their support to Kublai.
Take their support back.
Stop concerning yourself with an honorable victory.
Stop scrambling to name heirs.
I don't want it.
Give it to Orus.
I agree.
It will never happen, ever!
This is over.
Everyone but my daughter, out.
Get out.
I don't care what you want.
You will be the first female Khan of Mongolia.
I gave up everything for you.
My life... your mother.
That's not my burden.
Is this punishment?
For Byamba?
I think you wanted him to react the way he did.
You wanted him gone.
What purpose would that serve?
His support serviced my needs.
Don't remind me!
When I told you to get close to the Khan, you chose the path.
You chose Byamba, not me.
And you used it to your advantage.
Of course I did!
That's one of many reasons I will not be your heir.
I don't want to do things like that to the people I love.
And I won't allow you to do them to me.
You were supposed to get their votes, not uproot me!
Be careful with that!
-Promising me to others like a whore!
-Father...
Thanks to Genghis and his damned Kurultai, we travel hither and thither begging for approval.
-[Marco] But, Sire...
-Judge me by my actions, and Kaidu by his.
-What he did to my sons.
-[Jingim] Father, if you just...
What's done is done.
We throw a banquet, have a hunt.
Smack the chieftains into line, return home, victory in hand.
[sighs] Very wise, Father.
Don't.
Don't do that.
I want to be bitter.
[sighs]
I'm going to go.
[sighs]
Did you know about this?
You're going to make me read it?
It's Byamba's military assignment... as foot soldier.
You removed that from my desk.
-I did.
-You had no right.
-"Greetings, Great Khan." -[Ahmad] Apologies.
Greetings, Great Khan.
[grunts]
[Ahmad] You requested I find a suitable station for him.
The men in his tumen do not trust him.
I thought working his way through the ranks might earn their respect once again.
Shouldn't Byamba travel with us?
Let the chieftains see he has abandoned Kaidu and stands with his father.
Having him by your side right now is not a good idea.
He's his son, Ahmad.
And they'll wonder whose side he'll cozy up to tomorrow.
Enough!
Both of you.
I asked him to find a position for Byamba.
He did.
Give him back his paper!
[grunts]
[Kublai] You'll be missed while we're in Xanadu.
Someone must watch over Cambulac.
-The quiet will allow me to convalesce.
-[Kublai] Hmm.
Find Nayan.
Send him to me.
You're concerned about his support?
No.
Never.
He was in Karakorum with Kaidu.
He's honorable.
Believes all men deserve a chance to be heard.
[chuckles]
But he hates Kaidu.
Fortunate for us.
Yeah, but the other chieftains must hear him say it.
Nayan arrives here in three weeks.
[Mei Lin] Hmm.
It is auspicious timing, with Kublai headed to Xanadu.
You and I both know Nayan won't swear his allegiance to Kaidu.
Not willingly.
But given enough incentive... every man's will becomes flexible.
[wincing] [grunts]
[sighs]
Gimping around the palace must... be a prerequisite for the duties of this office.
Be grateful you're alive.
I was dying in that shit-infested cave... and I thought of you.
I know that look.
All too well.
It's of a man trying to win my affections after he's already bought me.
I haven't paid you a thing.
You've paid me in the one thing no man has been able to.
Hope... for a future with my daughter.
Did you enjoy seeing her?
And... as your Empress.
I haven't chosen an Empress yet.
I will... [grunts]
-...be your Empress.
-[sighs] [indistinct chatter]
I thought we might hunt together in Xanadu.
I'm on a different kind of hunt.
Then may heaven help the south.
Form up!
[sighs] You should be leading this tumen.
My father knows best.
Ahmad demoted you.
He serves my father.
Same difference.
I attempted to change the Khan's mind, but...
It's fine, Marco.
I imagine it's comforting to follow for a little while.
March, sleep, fight, kill.
Simple.
Move out!
This is where I can serve... what I do best, what I enjoy the most.
[Kasar] Oh, Bastard-Prince!
[Byamba] Or something like this.
If I take an arrow in the back, interrogate him before the Song, will you?
[chuckles] Take care of yourself, Byamba.
Take care of my father.
[door opening]
He has a report for you, my lord.
Get on with it.
My station is at the Princess' door.
We have many princesses.
Prince Jingim's recently seeded fourth wife.
And?
[guard] I escorted a stable hand into her bedroom... at an inappropriate hour, and... at Empress Chabi's command.
May I offer you a drink?
[bariyachi humming]
-Mother.
-Shh.
[humming continues]
[thunder rumbles]
Auli Burkhan.
[sighs]
Apologies, Empress.
Auli Burkhan won't say the sex of the child.
[Chabi] Won't say?
Make her say.
-[thunder rumbles] -[chanting] Auli Burkhan,
Auli Burkhan.
I'm sorry, Empress.
She sees nothing.
She sees nothing?
What does it mean, Mother?
It can take time to determine sex.
What if this baby isn't a boy?
What will happen then?
Nothing will happen.
It's a boy until proven otherwise.
Do you think she knows?
Who?
Knows what?
The bariyachi.
About the baby...
It isn't Jingim's.
[gasps]
Kokachin.
Sorry, Mother.
We'll speak of this baby only as a holy blessing and harbinger of joy.
Do you understand?
Yes, Mother.
There you are.
[breathes deeply]
Here I am.
There's been an attack in the south.
Many were killed.
I have to send my army.
They won't be accompanying us to Xanadu as I'd hoped.
I'm not going to Xanadu.
You're not?
Kokachin shouldn't travel.
The pregnancy must not be risked.
My place is here with her.
And what of your husband?
[Chabi] What of him?
Have you no place by him?
[Chabi sighs]
My husband has no further need of my advice.
He has no further need of me.
[gasps]
[birds chirping]
-[bird cawing] -[gasping]
Hello, Nergüi.
It's been a long time.
[sighs]
Lady Kokachin.
I was certain it was a mortal wound.
I would imagine so.
How else could you have managed this?
From peasant to princess overnight.
How did you survive?
A group of villagers found me.
They brought me to a shaman, and he somehow stemmed the bleeding.
I looked and looked for you.
But you were gone.
Not a trace.
Not a whisper.
Then I heard the news.
Prince Jingim is to wed the Blue Princess, last survivor of the Bayaut tribe.
That's how I found you.
And look at you.
You have everything a princess could ever want.
I want my life back.
Jingim's married to me.
This is my baby.
You found a way to take it.
Now find a way... to give it back.
If it flowed still... airag, or boal, or wine, or mead... no warrior could stop me.
I'd chase the Khanate as rabidly as my daughter runs from it.
Some are either too simple or too weak-willed to take what is theirs.
It isn't worth it.
I set out to have it on my own terms, and if I cannot, the Khanate is not worth it.
I can concede it.
I cannot concede my family.
And if I can give you both?
[rhythmic drumming]
Just one more, son.
You bear the burden of a long line of weak and worthless men.
These demons must be drawn to the surface and expelled.
[grunts]
[bird cawing]
I'm not my father... nor his father...
I'm not my father.
[softly] Nor his father, or his father before him.
I'm not my father... nor his father... or his father before him.
Yet still so far from greatness.
May the impotent forefathers of the House of Ögödei
-be expelled from this broken vessel.
-[eagle screeching]
May the deer of the past become the wolves of the present.
Through your suffering... may you rise to wear the black sable of Genghis Khan.
Chaos.
A most wonderful weapon.
Only takes a little push to upend the cart.
[Mei Lin] Hundreds of Kublai's men are dead.
I wouldn't call that... a little push.
[Ahmad] With his troops waging war in the south, the Khan is vulnerable.
Our forces will strike Kublai dead at a time of our choosing.
I have another problem.
What's that?
Marco.
He's in my affairs.
He's become a nuisance, and nuisances are the first to be swatted dead.
He seems beneath you, no?
Are you protecting him?
I'm lauding you.
Now... on your knees.
[grunts]
I can't.
Get up.
[grunts] [groans] [sighs]
[Mei Lin] Look at me.
Perhaps you'll get rid of the Latin for me.
Perhaps I will.
But for now... let me take care of you.
[Mei Lin humming pleasant melody]
[grunting]
[breathing heavily] [grunting]
[sighs] [indistinct chatter]
[exclaims] You've got a funny face already!
So... hands up.
And then like this.
[children laughing]
[Orqina] Master Ahmad.
You honor us.
I honored you with time.
I trust it's allowed you to fill your coffers.
[clicks tongue] [sighs] Bad news, Master A.
We find ourselves here again?
[Orqina] Girls get sick.
Hazard of the occupation.
Patrons don't declare, and the girls are left to pay.
I'm all sympathy, Madame, but the debt won't hide itself in my ledgers.
Perhaps it could... if you were properly motivated.
[claps]
[Ahmad] You wish to spread disease as far as Cambulac?
[clicks tongue] These three are 100% guaranteed well.
Very well.
Fresh... and nimble.
Very highly skilled.
Well, that leaves us with number three.
Look... you're a match.
Very lucky.
Oksana it is, then.
Six tumen descend on the south, and are on pace to arrive and support their brothers in a week's time.
Sixty thousand men?
How many are left to escort me to Xanadu?
Seven mingghans, Sire.
Seven thousand are traveling with me?
That's not a show of force.
That's a party.
It is not a concern, Sire.
You will travel in safety.
[Kublai] Hmm.
When we have finished putting down the rebellion,
I will send everyone I can to Karakorum in time for the Kurultai.
-That's when you'll need them.
-Hmm.
Your mother has chosen to stay behind.
Pack up your whore.
She's coming to Xanadu with me.
My whore?
Mei Lin?
For all her faults as assassin and procreator of my enemies... she has an uncommon way of keeping my mind clear of late.
[chuckles]
Sire.
[Marco grunting]
Who's on your mind, Polo?
-Sanga.
-[grunts]
Why would a long-dead taxman be vexing you now?
He worked for Ahmad.
And we never discovered who arranged for the assassination of Kublai.
[grunting]
-[joint cracks] -[Marco grunts]
Yusuf confessed in his own hand.
You don't believe that.
[grunts]
Continue with your speculation.
[panting] Ahmad ordered the entire army south, while the Khan rides north with little protection.
He advised execution of the Boy Emperor.
He demoted Byamba for no apparent reason.
He threatened my life.
He threatened your life?
[sighing] Not in so many words, but... the implication was clear.
So you condemn Ahmad's innuendo, but pardon Yusuf's writing?
He is the Khan's son, raised from boyhood.
You are a foreigner, raised by nobody.
It's a feeling, Sifu.
And you've trained me to trust in them.
Should I simply ignore it?
Do nothing?
The sage acts by doing nothing.
You... are not a sage.
[chuckles]
You shouldn't be here.
Before we returned to Cambulac, you thought the Emperor might die.
I presented it as a possibility.
You knew Ahmad would advise the Khan to execute that boy.
I knew no such thing.
It was an educated guess.
He wanted the boy dead.
Was it to incite war?
The Vice Regent doesn't share his political or military ruminations with the woman who tried to kill his mother.
You're lying.
You're too smart.
You've lived here too long not to have any insight.
When we returned from the south and stood before the Khan in the throne room... you spoke of my honor.
You defended me.
Now I wish to repay you.
Take your questions... take your suspicions... turn... and leave this place.
[sighing]
Dark days will soon be behind us.
[chuckles] The words of a fool.
Or of a man who has been filled with life by facing death.
Death faces us. [sighing]
No matter how we try to look away.
Your optimism smooths the road ahead.
[sighs heavily]
It's what makes us human... thinking we are administrators of the fates. [sighs]
What's wrong?
Perhaps, talk to your husband.
[inhales] He's never been interested in talking to me about anything that hasn't concerned him.
[sighing] And now, not even that.

Yeah, well, she's caused a lot of other people pain, too.
We had to reschedule that meeting.
Still, the canapes were good.
What do you want to do about our Arab chum?
Bring him out to the villa?
I don't much like that, it's too risky if someone's got a watch on him.
Invite him to the children's party.
There'll be lots of people there, you can do your magic tricks.
Try and get them right.
- Fix it up, will you?
- OK.
Sorry, darling, I don't know what I was thinking, it was a crass thing to say.
_
OK... let's go, dream boy.
Huh!
Come on.
Go left.
Up the stairs.
So the silly sod is insisting on 10% and he is digging his heels in.
All right, we'll let him enjoy that for a week, and then we'll take it away from him.
Yeah, that's fine.
I'm happy to go with that.
Ah, there he is.
Dans, you're on.
Thank you very much, sir, for rescuing me.
I hope you're feeling better.
You're very welcome.
All right, now scram.
See if you can catch us some mackerel for supper.
And take the dogs, will you?
Go on, Shirley.
Go on, you foul-smelling creature.
You'll call him, will you?
Yep.
Leave it with me, I'll deal with it.
Don't waste any energy trying to sweet-talk him,
- just lay it out, let him sweat.
- All right.
All right, Frisky, no more interruptions, no-one on the terrace.
- What the hell is that noise?
- Oh, Javier is blowing leaves.
Well, tell him to knock it off, will you?
Cease and desist.
How's the face?
- It's fine.
- We'll be all right.
- So, what do you want?
- I'd like to... to go back to the restaurant, if that's all right.
That's not what I meant.
What do you want... from the world?
I don't know.
I haven't got a plan.
I'm taking some time out.
Don't believe you.
You've never relaxed in your life.
If you say so.
Just sit down.
Everyone assumes that I was born with a silver spoon in my mouth.
It's balls.
My father was an Oxfordshire auctioneer, taught me the price of everything, but the drive to create all of this, that comes from me and me alone.
Where does it come from in you?
I'm not sure I have what you describe.
OK, you patched me up, I'm very grateful for that, and now I'd like to go.
Corky can't make you out, you see.
Suspicious chap, Corks.
He's got bad vibes about you.
Why did you kill that fellow in Devon?
It's all over the wire.
We had to call the police, no choice.
They'll be here any minute.
You are a cool cucumber, aren't you?
He cheated me.
And you didn't like that?
- No, I didn't.
- Quite right.
The MacArthurs have confirmed for dinner, so... that makes 12 tonight.
Or 13.
Come and tell us why you think this one's a bad apple, Corky?
Well, his references aren't too clever.
Luckily for you, old Jorge was so desperate for a sous chef, he didn't bother to check them.
You faked them, Pine?
I needed the job.
I needed it fast, I didn't have time for formalities.
Where'd you get the passport?
I met a girl... in Devon.
Didn't we all.
Pretty little thing.
Who's Quince?
Her ex.
He'd never been abroad, he'd never had a passport, so I took his name.
You've taken a lot of names, haven't you?
It makes a man wonder who you really are.
So, father killed in Belfast, no close relationship with mother, married once for six months, we can assume not a triumph.
Two tours in Iraq, distinguished service.
And on return, what?
Despair, depression, and then five years as a night owl in the hotel business.
What was that?
Hibernation?
Burying yourself alive?
And then a sudden moment of madness.
Thieving, narcotics... murder.
This is bloody chaos, Jonathan.
Do you even know who you are?
Those two chaps you smashed up in the restaurant, did you know them?
No.
They hadn't eaten there before?
Did they look like they'd eaten there before?
- Ever sailed a boat for them?
- Is this some kind of interrogation?
Let's pretend it is.
Did you cook for them?
No.
The mussels were marvellous, by the way.
So you weren't the lookout guy?
- You didn't switch roles halfway through?
- No.
That's another one of Corky's little theories.
Listen, I haven't asked for anything, all right?
I don't expect a reward,
I certainly don't appreciate this investigation into my personal life.
And, frankly, I'm bored of your hospitality.
Maybe I'm not squeaky-clean, but nor, I suspect, are you and your little friend here, so maybe we just leave it at that.
- Little friend!
- I know!
Charmant!
- Where are you going?
- I'm leaving.
What are you going to do for a passport?
I have a passport in the name of Thomas Quince.
Where is it?
Corky, sock him the bad news.
The passport's gone, old love.
Thomas Quince had to be shredded.
- What are you talking about?
- It's no good getting in a panic, my dear.
Your cover's blown sky-high.
Tom Quince is on every wanted list on God's earth.
Murder, theft, sadly not buggery, but we'll work on that.
That was my passport.
That was mine!
Well, you're going to have to learn to be someone else, aren't you?
I said no-one in here!
Sorry, baby, I didn't know.
Jesus!
Sorry, my darling, I didn't know it was you.
It's actually good news.
Thomas is going to be staying for a while,
- till he's fighting fit again.
- Oh.
That's great.
You want to come for a swim?
Go on.
Corky can lend you some Speedos.
I'd like to.
Corky, why don't you put him in the fisherman's cottage at the end of the estate...
- while we work out what to do with you.
- All right, boss.
And what am I supposed to do until then?
Well, you can keep Dans company.
We were supposed to have a school friend here for the holiday, but the bugger stood him up.
His mother doesn't approve of me.
One more thing...
I run a tight ship here.
You're right, we do a little swashbuckling every now and then, but we play straight with each other.
Now, you saved my boy and I'm grateful, but if you step out of line... we'll make you howl for your mother.
What size feet have you got?
- 12.
- Hmm.
Now, house rules.
No phones, no postcards to Devon dumplings.
No messages in a bottle.
The chief values privacy... as do we all.
All the way down to the beach, as far as you can go, and it's on the right.
Alternatively, fill your pockets with stones, walk into the sea... and keep going.
Anything?
No.
Bloody hell!
I hate this bit.
_
Off every tree you may freely eat... maids, serving wenches, cooks, typists, masseuses, even the lady who comes to clip the canary's claws.
But if you lay one hand on that precious fruit, then like the Belgians in the Congo, we'll chop it off.
And I don't mean the hand.
Senor Roper.
Morning.
I was wondering if I might take Danny into town?
What for?
A change.
- He likes you, doesn't he?
- I hope so.
I like him.
Frisky and Tabby will go with you.
Pine thank you.
It's me.
They're on the move.
Do you always have this much company, Danny?
Since the restaurant.
- It's a bit boring, isn't it?
- Yeah.
Oi!
It's OK.
It's all right.
- Danny?
- Yeah.
What do you say... to an ice cream?
- Yeah?
Great.
- Yeah.
Actually why don't you ask Frisky and Tabby if they want an ice cream as well, huh?
OK.
- Would you like an ice cream?
- No.
- Really?
Would you?
- No.
They didn't want one.
- They don't want one?
- No.
They are very strange, aren't they, those two?
Yeah, especially on a day like this, who wouldn't want an ice cream?
!
What's your favourite flavour, Danny?
- Pistachio.
- Dos pistachios, por favor.
Para mi.
- Danny?
- Yeah?
Do you know who's... coming to the party on Sunday?
It's a select group, around 25.
Senior, por favor...
Sorry, I need to hear the complete list, all the names of all your ice creams.
Oh, gracias.
Sorry.
That's all right.
I think Sandy and Caroline will probably be there, won't they?
I don't know who's coming.
You see, I've got this problem, it's Major Corcoran.
I don't think he likes me very much.
- Why not?
- I don't know.
But he's trying to find out everything he can about me.
All the way back to the time of the ancient Egyptians.
Mmm.
Muchos gracias.
Right, waiting's over.
- We've got a spot of work to do,
- All right, come on.
thank God.
- So, how often do you come here?
- Only in the summer.
It must be nice to see Dad, though?
Do you play tennis with him?
I have lessons with Lewis.
- Roper's not here much.
- Well, I expect he works hard, eh?
- That's why he has such a big house.
- I bet you've counted the rooms.
23.
There's three kitchens and a big office by the pool.
And there's Roper's secret study in his bedroom, but no-one's allowed in there.
- Except you?
Special guest?
- I'm not.
He calls it The Citadel.
And there's one key... and he hides it.
Do you know what's inside?
He says it's full of peppermints.
Well, I'd lock it up too if I were him.
Plus, there's an alarm.
They test it every day at 11.
You have to be really careful.
Why?
This is where I cut my foot last year.
Roper made me stand in the sea for about half an hour, because of the salt.
_
Ever since his daughter killed herself, he comes here every day.
And that's not all.
Yesterday afternoon, he calls the hotline of the Madrid Public Prosecutor's Office, says he has information regarding a world-class illegal arms deal.
Operator asks his name, he hangs up.
Assumption, a priest's advice only goes so far.
- Gracias, padre.
- Gracias.
Mr Apostol?
Who are you?
I'm your guardian angel, Mr Apostol.
I can't sleep.
Every night...
I ask myself the same question.
What I could have done?
Now you're having a child you can understand how I feel.
I can, Juan.
When you called the Madrid office, you had blood on your hands.
And I'm here to wash it off.
How?
- You know Richard Roper?
- Yes.
- He's a friend.
- Juan, he's not a friend.
He dragged you down and he dragged your daughter down too.
If Roper wasn't in your life, I think she'd still be alive today.
Sorry.
Now, God knows how you bear it, I...
I don't think I could.
Listen, I'm on the side of the angels.
We're good people, we play it straight and we keep our promises.
OK?
But I need your help.
Do you know Lance Corcoran?
Yes.
He's Dicky Roper's right-hand man.
Right, well, that's what needs to change.
Are you pink?
Socialist, left-wing, march of history, that sort of thing?
It wouldn't bother me if you were, it's another one of Corky's bugbears.
He seems to have a few.
Yeah.
Been in a lot of foxholes, me and Corky.
Once spent a week together in a police cell in Delhi.
I don't think I've ever laughed so much in my whole life.
Was he drinking then?
Well, now, that is a deeply odd thing to say.
What business is it of yours how much he drinks?
When my father was serving in Belfast a sergeant in his platoon got drunk one night, told a local girl what the next day's operation was.
The man I loved most in the world was dead for five pints of lager and the promise of a quickie.
Right, so you don't drink and you're not pink, what are you?
Me, I'm a free man.
Free to think, free to work, free to climb a mountain or lie in bed all day eating peppermint creams without any bugger telling me how.
Then I'm a free man.
Oh, that's the free part, the man part's a little different.
See, children grow up thinking the adult world is ordered, rational, fit for purpose.
It's crap.
Becoming a man is realising... that it's all rotten.
Realising how to celebrate that rottenness, that's freedom.
Here we are.
Out we go.
Come on.
Chop chop.
Let's go.
Mademoiselle.
- Merci, monsieur.
- OK.
Senor?
The bags, please.
Thank you so much.
Thank you so much for coming.
Have a wonderful day.
Caro, divine as ever.
- Sandy, sort of acceptable.
- There you go.
Apo, my dear old friend.
- I'm so terribly sorry for your loss.
- Thanks.
How are you?
I can't even imagine.
Mr Barghati, thank you so much for coming.
Please come inside.
Let's see if we can feed and sustain you before we get down to business.
And did you get the sweater?
Great.
Does it fit?
Mmm.
Uh-huh.
OK.
Love you.
Bye, honey.
I'm so sorry to interrupt.
The guests are arriving and the party's going to start soon.
The story begins in Egypt 4,500 years ago.
The ancient Egyptians invented this game.
It is literally the oldest trick in the book.
Now, you start with a ball.
We have one, two, three cups.
You lay one cup like that, one cup like that, one cup like that...
All right?
Now, I'm going to take the ball and I'm going to place the ball in the cup.
Shake the cup.
Turn it over.
All right, now, you have to watch very closely.
You have to watch the cups.
I'm going to move these two round like that.
This one round like that.
Everybody clear on where the ball is now?
Danny, where's the ball?
You think the ball's here?
No, Danny, the ball's in the middle!
You're not watching the cups, Danny.
Thomas is watching the cups, aren't you, Thomas?
You're a gym bunny, aren't you?
Aren't you?
A little cold gym bunny...
He can't stop his mouth... in every way.
Corky can get a little overexcited when he's drunk.
Yes, that is what Mr Barghati is worried about.
That little smile...
According to our friend, he has been shooting his mouth off... talking about things he should not.
Barghati doesn't want him involved... condition of the deal.
- Thanks for that, Apo.
- Spit.
Yeah!
Come...
Come with me...
And it's a funny thing, isn't it?
If you want to piss...
I am so sorry to interrupt, but can I just borrow the old man for a second?
- Oh, of course.
- Thank you.
- Excuse me.
- Bye.
Bye.
I have just spoken to Apo, and he has a...
There you go, Danny.
Thomas.
For God's sake...
Roper,
Thomas and I are going to go for a little stroll.
All right, darling.
Frisky, Major Corkoran is here with some friends of Dorothy that I would like to have escorted from the premises.
You and Tabby can make as much noise as you like.
All right?
- A pleasure.
- Tabbs.
If you need to relieve yourself, it's good to do it into a suitable perspective.
It's better than a urinal, isn't it?
- God's urinal, I call this.
- You've got to break it up.
You're giving the boss indigestion with your buddies here.
- Come on, lads.
The party's over.
- Frisky, go pee-pee.
Leave your drinks here.
Frisky, don't be too rough.
Who are all these people?
How should I know?
You're not curious?
Why should I be?
- It's business.
- Which is what?
Buying and selling agricultural equipment.
Caro says Sandy tells her everything.
That would drive me insane.
You shouldn't have seen me like that today, in my bedroom.
I'm sorry.
The door was open.
I thought you were dressed.
That's not what I meant.
I don't care who sees me naked.
I do care who sees me crying.
You tell no-one you saw that, is that clear?
Of course.
I'm going swimming.
- Want to come?
- Ah...
I don't think that would be wise.
There's no current.
That's not quite what I meant.
I know it wasn't.
There she goes, beyond the ha-ha!
One day, Thomas, you'll live a little.
_
Erm, come...
Rex, do you have a minute?
The Permanent Secretary would love to see you.
Erm, yes.
- Is that a yes or a no?
- Mm-hmm.
Rex, come in.
- You know Geoffrey Dromgoole, of course,
- Geoffrey.
- and his team from the River.
- Rex.
Barbara Vandon from the American Embassy.
Rex Mayhew, my undersecretary.
- Good to see you, Rex.
- Barbara, how are you?
Rex, it's this Limpet thing.
Limpet?
The Joel Steadman enforcement operation with Angela Burr on side-saddle.
Yes, I know what Limpet is...
it's an enforcement case.
It's nothing to do with Langley... or River House.
Well, it's what Barbara feels we ought to be discussing.
Rex, Langley has been completely railroaded on this.
Currently, we have a joint operation on foreign soil between two extremely fringe outfits.
They're chasing international arms in an area of the world that is... way beyond their comprehension.
It's crazy.
I have to say, I agree.
You know, Limpet is operating in a highly incendiary region, and I would hate to see that run out of control.
In my view, it should be placed under a purely intelligence jurisdiction, acting on a political brief, but, it's not my decision.
No, it's not.
I'm sure I don't need to remind you or your team that my recommendation, accepted by the Permanent Secretary, was that River House was overextended, and that enforcement agencies were urgently needed to prosecute any areas of international criminal activity that were,
for whatever reason, slipping through the intelligence net.
In that context, I find the actions of River House somewhat inimical to the new era of parliamentary accountability and transparency.
Does that answer your question?
- Why don't we leave it there for today?
- Thank you.
Have you got a moment?
Not much more than that...
Celia's cooking rabbit.
That's all it will take.
Good job in there.
You pressed all the right buttons...
accountability, transparency...
I don't like being bullied, never have.
You see, the thing is, I'm not sure that Limpet's quite the abject failure that Angela Burr would have us believe.
Really?
So, the day that the Limpet case is ours, you get an uncle in Switzerland who has suffered an untimely death... a rich uncle.
I'm going to pretend I didn't hear that.
You're in over your head, Rex.
- It's...
- Don't answer now... but think about it.
Enjoy the rabbit.
- Morning.
- Hi.
- Are you not swimming?
- I'm not in the mood.
I like you, Thomas...
You see everything and say nothing.
My husband is screwing our nanny.
What a cliché.
Jed said I should have hired an uglier girl but the agency only had stunners.
Could you do my back?
Don't worry, I don't want to sleep with you.
- Why is he keeping you here?
- I don't know.
Grooming you, is he?
For what?
You just be careful.
Roper's planning a big arms deal to Apo's Lebanese friend.
Weapons from seven British and American companies... weapons no-one should be trading in.
Roper's using a company called TradePass to fence the deal.
He pretends it trades in agricultural equipment and his investors pretend to believe him.
You can stop rubbing now.
Why are you telling me this?
I just want to be honest with someone in this world.
Does Jed know?
No, of course not!
Sandy screws everyone and tells me everything.
Roper is steadfastly faithful and tells Jed nothing.
Do you think I should tell her?
Maybe.
If it's worry for your boy, forget it.
He knew what he was getting into.
Did he?
So, you and Mr Burr, are you making a go of it?
Well, you know, like my mum says, "You make your bed... you die in it."
No, Gordon's a decent man.
It's not his fault I'm not in love with him.
Listen...
Oh, Joel, let's not have that conversation, please?
Well, you can't deny the past.
- Past is all it is.
- It doesn't have to be.
Joel...
You silly sod.
Hi, Corky.
Frisky.
Hey, Danny.
Thomas, have you seen my phone?
I haven't.
Sorry.
Dad'll be cross.
Everyone's cross and Jed's not talking to Dad.
What's going on?
I don't know.
I'll tell you what, why don't I come downstairs and read you a bedtime story, and we can look for your phone in the morning?
OK.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
What should we read?
I don't know.
Which one's your favourite?
Three Little Pigs.
OK, the pigs?
I can give you the Thomas version...
Two Little Pigs.
No.
What's that?
That right there.
Punch that up.
Punch that up.
What is it?
It's your boy.
"Seven tractor firms"...
seven armament manufacturers?
"Home sale with best friend", that's the UK and the US.
"Buyer in Beirut via Worst Man".
Well, Worst Man is Roper.
Roper's the middleman?
- What's TradePass?
- I'm not sure, must be a front organisation.
What I do know, though, is Roper's pressed the green light.
All right.
OK.
Hey, guys...
OK, so, just put the cases by the taxi and then you can jump in.
Good girl.
Pop in.
Jump in.
OK, put your seatbelts on, guys.
OK...
OK.
Here we go.
Get in the taxi, you bloody whore!
- Caroline, for...
- You bitch!
Caroline, for Christ's sake, she's going.
She's going.
She's go...
- Caro...
- Bitch!
- Whore!
- Caroline.
- Just shut up!
- All right.
Just shut up, Sandy, you shit!
What, you like the show?
You like the show, Dicky?
Dicky Roper?
See you later, guys.
Jed, darling...
Don't even.
Where is everybody?
- Monaco.
- Huh.
Two days of meetings.
Things are ramping up.
And you're not...
- You're not going too?
- Not me, no.
The girl was supposed to go but she's blown him out.
I'm staying with her.
We're going riding instead.
Didn't she invite you?
Oh, dear.
Very good.
Well, have a nice time.
I'll just be a minute.
What are you doing in here?
I brought you some flowers.
Why didn't you give them to the maids?
- I have to change.
- Close the door.
You can't be in here.
This is our bedroom.
What is that?
I found it on the desktop.
You broke into his office and you spied on his papers.
You have to be more careful.
Darling, Angel, Sweetie, everyone's starving...
- He can't see you.
- Get rid of him.
Are you decent?
- What's going on?
- Nothing.
I'm coming.
_
How was your trip?
Noisy.
I hitched a ride on a C-130.
- Oh, fun.
- How was yours?
Fine, thank you.
I'm not sure why we had to make it.
Is there a reason we're doing this in person?
Well, Halo is not too keen on intermediaries just now.
And yet he's sent you?
There's an enforcement operation called Limpet.
We have to keep our eyes on it.
Halo says you need to be careful.
I am always careful.
How far have they got?
They've drawn a line between Langbourne and Apostol.
- Jesus.
- How did they manage that?
A photograph of a meeting.
Are they after buyers or sellers?
We don't know.
We assume both.
You can assure Halo that we have taken every precaution.
We have received intelligence of our own.
We are changing the guard.
Good.
How was your meeting?
It was fine.
It was fine?
Don't be so bloody childish!
Look, Caro was upset.
She wanted to get back at Sandy so she started spreading manure.
That's it.
End of story.
That's what it is... it's just a story?
Jesus, Jed, what the hell is the matter with you?
Tell me why I should believe you.
Why shouldn't you believe me?
- When have I ever lied to you?
- Oh, you... you don't lie to me.
You're much too clever for that.
You just hide.
- What?
What do I hide?
- The truth, Roper!
Well, what about your truth?
What about the things you hide from me?
I don't hide anything from you.
You have a child, Jed!
You have a son.
Let's start with him.
Or don't you think he counts?
How do you know that?
We're not talking how, we're talking why.
Why would you hide that from me?
That was not included in the brochure.
Screw your brochure, Roper.
You don't own me.
No-one is entitled to know things about me that I don't want them to know.
Oh, but you're entitled to spy on my life?
I can read a bloody bank statement.
I'm paying money to raise another man's kid.
I know that and now anyone listening to this phone call knows it too.
Apart from that, how was your day?
_
On your feet, soldier.
Where the hell did he get that?
- "Halo".
- Yeah.
They're back?
Apparently so.
The chief wants to see you.
Not you, him.
Present for you on the table.
Thank you.
I told them to put some visas in it and make it look scruffy.
Never trust a new passport, in my view.
Always go with the old 'uns... like Third World taxi drivers, there's a reason they have survived.
"Andrew Birch"?
We like the tree thing, we thought we'd stick with that.
It's all official.
You are reborn.
The visas are real.
If you want to renew, go to the consulate abroad...
less risky.
- What's up?
- Erm, I thought that was my present.
Well, it can be, if you do something for me.
Right.
Sandy, papers.
Mm-hmm.
We're going to need a witness... preferably Spanish so they can't actually read the bloody thing.
I'll get Carlos.
- Is he 18?
- Yeah.
Wait, what is this?
What am I signing?
Jesus, Pine, for a murderer on the run, you're pretty bloody picky.
I am giving you your own company.
Erm...
Look, I...
Look, I really...
I don't know anything about running a company.
You don't have to.
All you have to do is sign as Andrew Birch.
Why don't you practise a few signatures?
Get the feel of it.
Andrew Birch.
B-I-R,
C for Charlie,
H for Hotel.
Go on.
Manly one.
Go for a manly one.
Andrew Birch in a hurry.
Andrew Birch.
One more.
That's more like it.
Carlos, ven aqui.
- Necesito que firmes esto.
- _
_
_
There and there and one more there.
Carlos, here, right at the bottom.
Good lad.
Welcome to the family, Andrew.
- ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ - _

My darling daughter!
The most beautiful girl in the world!

- Ooh!
The most expensive necklace!

Enjoy the party!
Thank you.
What about austerity, Apo?
This is austerity.
You should have seen our country five years ago.
- Tomorrow's business...
- Uh-huh?
By the way, my Arab friend is concerned you can't deliver the merchandise you promised.
I wouldn't worry about that, Apo, it'll be fine.
I hope so.
- Ah, Mr Barghati.
- Sandy.
How good to see you.
Oh, my goodness!
Oh, Lord!
Oh, Lord!
What's happening here?
Qué pasa?
Qué pasa?
Qué pasa?
- Jesus!
- Help her!
Help me, please!
Elena!
Elena!
Elena!
Elena!
Elena!
She must've been in so much pain.
Yeah, well, she's caused a lot of other people pain, too.
We had to reschedule that meeting.
Still, the canapes were good.
What do you want to do about our Arab chum?
Bring him out to the villa?
I don't much like that, it's too risky if someone's got a watch on him.
Invite him to the children's party.
There'll be lots of people there, you can do your magic tricks.
Try and get them right.
- Fix it up, will you?
- OK.
Sorry, darling, I don't know what I was thinking, it was a crass thing to say.
_
OK... let's go, dream boy.
Huh!
Come on.
Go left.
Up the stairs.
So the silly sod is insisting on 10% and he is digging his heels in.
All right, we'll let him enjoy that for a week, and then we'll take it away from him.
Yeah, that's fine.
I'm happy to go with that.
Ah, there he is.
Dans, you're on.
Thank you very much, sir, for rescuing me.
I hope you're feeling better.
You're very welcome.
All right, now scram.
See if you can catch us some mackerel for supper.
And take the dogs, will you?
Go on, Shirley.
Go on, you foul-smelling creature.
You'll call him, will you?
Yep.
Leave it with me, I'll deal with it.
Don't waste any energy trying to sweet-talk him,
- just lay it out, let him sweat.
- All right.
All right, Frisky, no more interruptions, no-one on the terrace.
- What the hell is that noise?
- Oh, Javier is blowing leaves.
Well, tell him to knock it off, will you?
Cease and desist.
How's the face?
- It's fine.
- We'll be all right.
- So, what do you want?
- I'd like to... to go back to the restaurant, if that's all right.
That's not what I meant.
What do you want... from the world?
I don't know.
I haven't got a plan.
I'm taking some time out.
Don't believe you.
You've never relaxed in your life.
If you say so.
Just sit down.
Everyone assumes that I was born with a silver spoon in my mouth.
It's balls.
My father was an Oxfordshire auctioneer, taught me the price of everything, but the drive to create all of this, that comes from me and me alone.
Where does it come from in you?
I'm not sure I have what you describe.
OK, you patched me up, I'm very grateful for that, and now I'd like to go.
Corky can't make you out, you see.
Suspicious chap, Corks.
He's got bad vibes about you.
Why did you kill that fellow in Devon?
It's all over the wire.
We had to call the police, no choice.
They'll be here any minute.
You are a cool cucumber, aren't you?
He cheated me.
And you didn't like that?
- No, I didn't.
- Quite right.
The MacArthurs have confirmed for dinner, so... that makes 12 tonight.
Or 13.
Come and tell us why you think this one's a bad apple, Corky?
Well, his references aren't too clever.
Luckily for you, old Jorge was so desperate for a sous chef, he didn't bother to check them.
You faked them, Pine?
I needed the job.
I needed it fast, I didn't have time for formalities.
Where'd you get the passport?
I met a girl... in Devon.
Didn't we all.
Pretty little thing.
Who's Quince?
Her ex.
He'd never been abroad, he'd never had a passport, so I took his name.
You've taken a lot of names, haven't you?
It makes a man wonder who you really are.
So, father killed in Belfast, no close relationship with mother, married once for six months, we can assume not a triumph.
Two tours in Iraq, distinguished service.
And on return, what?
Despair, depression, and then five years as a night owl in the hotel business.
What was that?
Hibernation?
Burying yourself alive?
And then a sudden moment of madness.
Thieving, narcotics... murder.
This is bloody chaos, Jonathan.
Do you even know who you are?
Those two chaps you smashed up in the restaurant, did you know them?
No.
They hadn't eaten there before?
Did they look like they'd eaten there before?
- Ever sailed a boat for them?
- Is this some kind of interrogation?
Let's pretend it is.
Did you cook for them?
No.
The mussels were marvellous, by the way.
So you weren't the lookout guy?
- You didn't switch roles halfway through?
- No.
That's another one of Corky's little theories.
Listen, I haven't asked for anything, all right?
I don't expect a reward,
I certainly don't appreciate this investigation into my personal life.
And, frankly, I'm bored of your hospitality.
Maybe I'm not squeaky-clean, but nor, I suspect, are you and your little friend here, so maybe we just leave it at that.
- Little friend!
- I know!
Charmant!
- Where are you going?
- I'm leaving.
What are you going to do for a passport?
I have a passport in the name of Thomas Quince.
Where is it?
Corky, sock him the bad news.
The passport's gone, old love.
Thomas Quince had to be shredded.
- What are you talking about?
- It's no good getting in a panic, my dear.
Your cover's blown sky-high.
Tom Quince is on every wanted list on God's earth.
Murder, theft, sadly not buggery, but we'll work on that.
That was my passport.
That was mine!
Well, you're going to have to learn to be someone else, aren't you?
I said no-one in here!
Sorry, baby, I didn't know.
Jesus!
Sorry, my darling, I didn't know it was you.
It's actually good news.
Thomas is going to be staying for a while,
- till he's fighting fit again.
- Oh.
That's great.
You want to come for a swim?
Go on.
Corky can lend you some Speedos.
I'd like to.
Corky, why don't you put him in the fisherman's cottage at the end of the estate...
- while we work out what to do with you.
- All right, boss.
And what am I supposed to do until then?
Well, you can keep Dans company.
We were supposed to have a school friend here for the holiday, but the bugger stood him up.
His mother doesn't approve of me.
One more thing...
I run a tight ship here.
You're right, we do a little swashbuckling every now and then, but we play straight with each other.
Now, you saved my boy and I'm grateful, but if you step out of line... we'll make you howl for your mother.
What size feet have you got?
- 12.
- Hmm.
Now, house rules.
No phones, no postcards to Devon dumplings.
No messages in a bottle.
The chief values privacy... as do we all.
All the way down to the beach, as far as you can go, and it's on the right.
Alternatively, fill your pockets with stones, walk into the sea... and keep going.
Anything?
No.
Bloody hell!
I hate this bit.
_
Off every tree you may freely eat... maids, serving wenches, cooks, typists, masseuses, even the lady who comes to clip the canary's claws.
But if you lay one hand on that precious fruit, then like the Belgians in the Congo, we'll chop it off.
And I don't mean the hand.
Senor Roper.
Morning.
I was wondering if I might take Danny into town?
What for?
A change.
- He likes you, doesn't he?
- I hope so.
I like him.
Frisky and Tabby will go with you.
Pine thank you.
It's me.
They're on the move.
Do you always have this much company, Danny?
Since the restaurant.
- It's a bit boring, isn't it?
- Yeah.
Oi!
It's OK.
It's all right.
- Danny?
- Yeah.
What do you say... to an ice cream?
- Yeah?
Great.
- Yeah.
Actually why don't you ask Frisky and Tabby if they want an ice cream as well, huh?
OK.
- Would you like an ice cream?
- No.
- Really?
Would you?
- No.
They didn't want one.
- They don't want one?
- No.
They are very strange, aren't they, those two?
Yeah, especially on a day like this, who wouldn't want an ice cream?
!
What's your favourite flavour, Danny?
- Pistachio.
- Dos pistachios, por favor.
Para mi.
- Danny?
- Yeah?
Do you know who's... coming to the party on Sunday?
It's a select group, around 25.
Senior, por favor...
Sorry, I need to hear the complete list, all the names of all your ice creams.
Oh, gracias.
Sorry.
That's all right.
I think Sandy and Caroline will probably be there, won't they?
I don't know who's coming.
You see, I've got this problem, it's Major Corcoran.
I don't think he likes me very much.
- Why not?
- I don't know.
But he's trying to find out everything he can about me.
All the way back to the time of the ancient Egyptians.
Mmm.
Muchos gracias.
Right, waiting's over.
- We've got a spot of work to do,
- All right, come on.
thank God.
- So, how often do you come here?
- Only in the summer.
It must be nice to see Dad, though?
Do you play tennis with him?
I have lessons with Lewis.
- Roper's not here much.
- Well, I expect he works hard, eh?
- That's why he has such a big house.
- I bet you've counted the rooms.
23.
There's three kitchens and a big office by the pool.
And there's Roper's secret study in his bedroom, but no-one's allowed in there.
- Except you?
Special guest?
- I'm not.
He calls it The Citadel.
And there's one key... and he hides it.
Do you know what's inside?
He says it's full of peppermints.
Well, I'd lock it up too if I were him.
Plus, there's an alarm.
They test it every day at 11.
You have to be really careful.
Why?
This is where I cut my foot last year.
Roper made me stand in the sea for about half an hour, because of the salt.
_
Ever since his daughter killed herself, he comes here every day.
And that's not all.
Yesterday afternoon, he calls the hotline of the Madrid Public Prosecutor's Office, says he has information regarding a world-class illegal arms deal.
Operator asks his name, he hangs up.
Assumption, a priest's advice only goes so far.
- Gracias, padre.
- Gracias.
Mr Apostol?
Who are you?
I'm your guardian angel, Mr Apostol.
I can't sleep.
Every night...
I ask myself the same question.
What I could have done?
Now you're having a child you can understand how I feel.
I can, Juan.
When you called the Madrid office, you had blood on your hands.
And I'm here to wash it off.
How?
- You know Richard Roper?
- Yes.
- He's a friend.
- Juan, he's not a friend.
He dragged you down and he dragged your daughter down too.
If Roper wasn't in your life, I think she'd still be alive today.
Sorry.
Now, God knows how you bear it, I...
I don't think I could.
Listen, I'm on the side of the angels.
We're good people, we play it straight and we keep our promises.
OK?
But I need your help.
Do you know Lance Corcoran?
Yes.
He's Dicky Roper's right-hand man.
Right, well, that's what needs to change.
Are you pink?
Socialist, left-wing, march of history, that sort of thing?
It wouldn't bother me if you were, it's another one of Corky's bugbears.
He seems to have a few.
Yeah.
Been in a lot of foxholes, me and Corky.
Once spent a week together in a police cell in Delhi.
I don't think I've ever laughed so much in my whole life.
Was he drinking then?
Well, now, that is a deeply odd thing to say.
What business is it of yours how much he drinks?
When my father was serving in Belfast a sergeant in his platoon got drunk one night, told a local girl what the next day's operation was.
The man I loved most in the world was dead for five pints of lager and the promise of a quickie.
Right, so you don't drink and you're not pink, what are you?
Me, I'm a free man.
Free to think, free to work, free to climb a mountain or lie in bed all day eating peppermint creams without any bugger telling me how.
Then I'm a free man.
Oh, that's the free part, the man part's a little different.
See, children grow up thinking the adult world is ordered, rational, fit for purpose.
It's crap.
Becoming a man is realising... that it's all rotten.
Realising how to celebrate that rottenness, that's freedom.
Here we are.
Out we go.
Come on.
Chop chop.
Let's go.
Mademoiselle.
- Merci, monsieur.
- OK.
Senor?
The bags, please.
Thank you so much.
Thank you so much for coming.
Have a wonderful day.
Caro, divine as ever.
- Sandy, sort of acceptable.
- There you go.
Apo, my dear old friend.
- I'm so terribly sorry for your loss.
- Thanks.
How are you?
I can't even imagine.
Mr Barghati, thank you so much for coming.
Please come inside.
Let's see if we can feed and sustain you before we get down to business.
And did you get the sweater?
Great.
Does it fit?
Mmm.
Uh-huh.
OK.
Love you.
Bye, honey.
I'm so sorry to interrupt.
The guests are arriving and the party's going to start soon.
The story begins in Egypt 4,500 years ago.
The ancient Egyptians invented this game.
It is literally the oldest trick in the book.
Now, you start with a ball.
We have one, two, three cups.
You lay one cup like that, one cup like that, one cup like that...
All right?
Now, I'm going to take the ball and I'm going to place the ball in the cup.
Shake the cup.
Turn it over.
All right, now, you have to watch very closely.
You have to watch the cups.
I'm going to move these two round like that.
This one round like that.
Everybody clear on where the ball is now?
Danny, where's the ball?
You think the ball's here?
No, Danny, the ball's in the middle!
You're not watching the cups, Danny.
Thomas is watching the cups, aren't you, Thomas?
You're a gym bunny, aren't you?
Aren't you?
A little cold gym bunny...
He can't stop his mouth... in every way.
Corky can get a little overexcited when he's drunk.
Yes, that is what Mr Barghati is worried about.
That little smile...
According to our friend, he has been shooting his mouth off... talking about things he should not.
Barghati doesn't want him involved... condition of the deal.
- Thanks for that, Apo.
- Spit.
Yeah!
Come...
Come with me...
And it's a funny thing, isn't it?
If you want to piss...
I am so sorry to interrupt, but can I just borrow the old man for a second?
- Oh, of course.
- Thank you.
- Excuse me.
- Bye.
Bye.
I have just spoken to Apo, and he has a...
There you go, Danny.
Thomas.
For God's sake...
Roper,
Thomas and I are going to go for a little stroll.
All right, darling.
Frisky, Major Corkoran is here with some friends of Dorothy that I would like to have escorted from the premises.
You and Tabby can make as much noise as you like.
All right?
- A pleasure.
- Tabbs.
If you need to relieve yourself, it's good to do it into a suitable perspective.
It's better than a urinal, isn't it?
- God's urinal, I call this.
- You've got to break it up.
You're giving the boss indigestion with your buddies here.
- Come on, lads.
The party's over.
- Frisky, go pee-pee.
Leave your drinks here.
Frisky, don't be too rough.
Who are all these people?
How should I know?
You're not curious?
Why should I be?
- It's business.
- Which is what?
Buying and selling agricultural equipment.
Caro says Sandy tells her everything.
That would drive me insane.
You shouldn't have seen me like that today, in my bedroom.
I'm sorry.
The door was open.
I thought you were dressed.
That's not what I meant.
I don't care who sees me naked.
I do care who sees me crying.
You tell no-one you saw that, is that clear?
Of course.
I'm going swimming.
- Want to come?
- Ah...
I don't think that would be wise.
There's no current.
That's not quite what I meant.
I know it wasn't.
There she goes, beyond the ha-ha!
One day, Thomas, you'll live a little.
_
Erm, come...
Rex, do you have a minute?
The Permanent Secretary would love to see you.
Erm, yes.
- Is that a yes or a no?
- Mm-hmm.
Rex, come in.
- You know Geoffrey Dromgoole, of course,
- Geoffrey.
- and his team from the River.
- Rex.
Barbara Vandon from the American Embassy.
Rex Mayhew, my undersecretary.
- Good to see you, Rex.
- Barbara, how are you?
Rex, it's this Limpet thing.
Limpet?
The Joel Steadman enforcement operation with Angela Burr on side-saddle.
Yes, I know what Limpet is...
it's an enforcement case.
It's nothing to do with Langley... or River House.
Well, it's what Barbara feels we ought to be discussing.
Rex, Langley has been completely railroaded on this.
Currently, we have a joint operation on foreign soil between two extremely fringe outfits.
They're chasing international arms in an area of the world that is... way beyond their comprehension.
It's crazy.
I have to say, I agree.
You know, Limpet is operating in a highly incendiary region, and I would hate to see that run out of control.
In my view, it should be placed under a purely intelligence jurisdiction, acting on a political brief, but, it's not my decision.
No, it's not.
I'm sure I don't need to remind you or your team that my recommendation, accepted by the Permanent Secretary, was that River House was overextended, and that enforcement agencies were urgently needed to prosecute any areas of international criminal activity that were,
for whatever reason, slipping through the intelligence net.
In that context, I find the actions of River House somewhat inimical to the new era of parliamentary accountability and transparency.
Does that answer your question?
- Why don't we leave it there for today?
- Thank you.
Have you got a moment?
Not much more than that...
Celia's cooking rabbit.
That's all it will take.
Good job in there.
You pressed all the right buttons...
accountability, transparency...
I don't like being bullied, never have.
You see, the thing is, I'm not sure that Limpet's quite the abject failure that Angela Burr would have us believe.
Really?
So, the day that the Limpet case is ours, you get an uncle in Switzerland who has suffered an untimely death... a rich uncle.
I'm going to pretend I didn't hear that.
You're in over your head, Rex.
- It's...
- Don't answer now... but think about it.
Enjoy the rabbit.
- Morning.
- Hi.
- Are you not swimming?
- I'm not in the mood.
I like you, Thomas...
You see everything and say nothing.
My husband is screwing our nanny.
What a cliché.
Jed said I should have hired an uglier girl but the agency only had stunners.
Could you do my back?
Don't worry, I don't want to sleep with you.
- Why is he keeping you here?
- I don't know.
Grooming you, is he?
For what?
You just be careful.
Roper's planning a big arms deal to Apo's Lebanese friend.
Weapons from seven British and American companies... weapons no-one should be trading in.
Roper's using a company called TradePass to fence the deal.
He pretends it trades in agricultural equipment and his investors pretend to believe him.
You can stop rubbing now.
Why are you telling me this?
I just want to be honest with someone in this world.
Does Jed know?
No, of course not!
Sandy screws everyone and tells me everything.
Roper is steadfastly faithful and tells Jed nothing.
Do you think I should tell her?
Maybe.
If it's worry for your boy, forget it.
He knew what he was getting into.
Did he?
So, you and Mr Burr, are you making a go of it?
Well, you know, like my mum says, "You make your bed... you die in it."
No, Gordon's a decent man.
It's not his fault I'm not in love with him.
Listen...
Oh, Joel, let's not have that conversation, please?
Well, you can't deny the past.
- Past is all it is.
- It doesn't have to be.
Joel...
You silly sod.
Hi, Corky.
Frisky.
Hey, Danny.
Thomas, have you seen my phone?
I haven't.
Sorry.
Dad'll be cross.
Everyone's cross and Jed's not talking to Dad.
What's going on?
I don't know.
I'll tell you what, why don't I come downstairs and read you a bedtime story, and we can look for your phone in the morning?
OK.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
What should we read?
I don't know.
Which one's your favourite?
Three Little Pigs.
OK, the pigs?
I can give you the Thomas version...
Two Little Pigs.
No.
What's that?
That right there.
Punch that up.
Punch that up.
What is it?
It's your boy.
"Seven tractor firms"...
seven armament manufacturers?
"Home sale with best friend", that's the UK and the US.
"Buyer in Beirut via Worst Man".
Well, Worst Man is Roper.
Roper's the middleman?
- What's TradePass?
- I'm not sure, must be a front organisation.
What I do know, though, is Roper's pressed the green light.
All right.
OK.
Hey, guys...
OK, so, just put the cases by the taxi and then you can jump in.
Good girl.
Pop in.
Jump in.
OK, put your seatbelts on, guys.
OK...
OK.
Here we go.
Get in the taxi, you bloody whore!
- Caroline, for...
- You bitch!
Caroline, for Christ's sake, she's going.
She's going.
She's go...
- Caro...
- Bitch!
- Whore!
- Caroline.
- Just shut up!
- All right.
Just shut up, Sandy, you shit!
What, you like the show?
You like the show, Dicky?
Dicky Roper?
See you later, guys.
Jed, darling...
Don't even.
Where is everybody?
- Monaco.
- Huh.
Two days of meetings.
Things are ramping up.
And you're not...
- You're not going too?
- Not me, no.
The girl was supposed to go but she's blown him out.
I'm staying with her.
We're going riding instead.
Didn't she invite you?
Oh, dear.
Very good.
Well, have a nice time.
I'll just be a minute.
What are you doing in here?
I brought you some flowers.
Why didn't you give them to the maids?
- I have to change.
- Close the door.
You can't be in here.
This is our bedroom.
What is that?
I found it on the desktop.
You broke into his office and you spied on his papers.
You have to be more careful.
Darling, Angel, Sweetie, everyone's starving...
- He can't see you.
- Get rid of him.
Are you decent?
- What's going on?
- Nothing.
I'm coming.
_
How was your trip?
Noisy.
I hitched a ride on a C-130.
- Oh, fun.
- How was yours?
Fine, thank you.
I'm not sure why we had to make it.
Is there a reason we're doing this in person?
Well, Halo is not too keen on intermediaries just now.
And yet he's sent you?
There's an enforcement operation called Limpet.
We have to keep our eyes on it.
Halo says you need to be careful.
I am always careful.
How far have they got?
They've drawn a line between Langbourne and Apostol.
- Jesus.
- How did they manage that?
A photograph of a meeting.
Are they after buyers or sellers?
We don't know.
We assume both.
You can assure Halo that we have taken every precaution.
We have received intelligence of our own.
We are changing the guard.
Good.
How was your meeting?
It was fine.
It was fine?
Don't be so bloody childish!
Look, Caro was upset.
She wanted to get back at Sandy so she started spreading manure.
That's it.
End of story.
That's what it is... it's just a story?
Jesus, Jed, what the hell is the matter with you?
Tell me why I should believe you.
Why shouldn't you believe me?
- When have I ever lied to you?
- Oh, you... you don't lie to me.
You're much too clever for that.
You just hide.
- What?
What do I hide?
- The truth, Roper!
Well, what about your truth?
What about the things you hide from me?
I don't hide anything from you.
You have a child, Jed!
You have a son.
Let's start with him.
Or don't you think he counts?
How do you know that?
We're not talking how, we're talking why.
Why would you hide that from me?
That was not included in the brochure.
Screw your brochure, Roper.
You don't own me.
No-one is entitled to know things about me that I don't want them to know.
Oh, but you're entitled to spy on my life?
I can read a bloody bank statement.
I'm paying money to raise another man's kid.
I know that and now anyone listening to this phone call knows it too.
Apart from that, how was your day?
_
On your feet, soldier.
Where the hell did he get that?
- "Halo".
- Yeah.
They're back?
Apparently so.
The chief wants to see you.
Not you, him.
Present for you on the table.
Thank you.
I told them to put some visas in it and make it look scruffy.
Never trust a new passport, in my view.
Always go with the old 'uns... like Third World taxi drivers, there's a reason they have survived.
"Andrew Birch"?
We like the tree thing, we thought we'd stick with that.
It's all official.
You are reborn.
The visas are real.
If you want to renew, go to the consulate abroad...
less risky.
- What's up?
- Erm, I thought that was my present.
Well, it can be, if you do something for me.
Right.
Sandy, papers.
Mm-hmm.
We're going to need a witness... preferably Spanish so they can't actually read the bloody thing.
I'll get Carlos.
- Is he 18?
- Yeah.
Wait, what is this?
What am I signing?
Jesus, Pine, for a murderer on the run, you're pretty bloody picky.
I am giving you your own company.
Erm...
Look, I...
Look, I really...
I don't know anything about running a company.
You don't have to.
All you have to do is sign as Andrew Birch.
Why don't you practise a few signatures?
Get the feel of it.
Andrew Birch.
B-I-R,
C for Charlie,
H for Hotel.
Go on.
Manly one.
Go for a manly one.
Andrew Birch in a hurry.
Andrew Birch.
One more.
That's more like it.
Carlos, ven aqui.
- Necesito que firmes esto.

There and there and one more there.
Carlos, here, right at the bottom.
Good lad.
Welcome to the family, Andrew.
♪ Happy birthday to you, ♪
♪ Happy birthday to you, ♪
♪ Happy birthday, dear Elena. ♪
♪ Happy birthday to you. ♪
My darling daughter!
The most beautiful girl in the world!
- A marvellous necklace from Paris!
- Ooh!
The most expensive necklace!
Enjoy the party!
Thank you.
What about austerity, Apo?
This is austerity.
You should have seen our country five years ago.
- Tomorrow's business...
- Uh-huh?
By the way, my Arab friend is concerned you can't deliver the merchandise you promised.
- I wouldn't worry about that, Apo, it'll be fine.
- I hope so.
- Ah, Mr Barghati.
- Sandy.
- How good to see you.
Oh, my goodness!
Oh, Lord!
Oh, Lord!
What's happening here?
Que pasa?
- Jesus!
- Help her!
Help me, please!
Elena!
Elena!
Elena!
Elena!
ELENA!
She must've been in so much pain.
Yeah, well, she's caused a lot of other people pain, too.
We had to reschedule that meeting.
Still, the canapes were good.
What do you want to do about our Arab chum?
Bring him out to the villa?
I don't much like that, it's too risky if someone's got a watch on him.
Invite him to the children's party.
There'll be lots of people there, you can do your magic tricks.
Try and get them right.
- Fix it up, will you?
- OK.
Sorry, darling, I don't know what I was thinking, it was a crass thing to say.
OK... let's go, dream boy.
Huh!
Come on.
Go left.
Up the stairs.
So the silly sod is insisting on 10% and he is digging his heels in.
All right, we'll let him enjoy that for a week, and then we'll take it away from him.
I'm happy to go with that.
Ah, there he is.
Dans, you're on.
Thank you very much, sir, for rescuing me.
I hope you're feeling better.
You're very welcome.
All right, now scram.
See if you can catch us some mackerel for supper.
And take the dogs, will you?
Go on, Shirley.
Go on, you foul-smelling creature.
- You'll call him, will you?
- Yep.
Leave it with me, I'll deal with it.
Don't waste any energy trying to sweet-talk him,
- just lay it out, let him sweat.
- All right.
All right, Frisky, no more interruptions, no-one on the terrace.
- What the hell is that noise?
- Oh, Javier is blowing leaves.
Well, tell him to knock it off, will you?
Cease and desist.
How's the face?
- It's fine.
- We'll be all right.
- So, what do you want?
- I'd like to... to go back to the restaurant, if that's all right.
That's not what I meant.
What do you want... from the world?
I don't know.
- I haven't got a plan.
I'm taking some time out.
- Don't believe you.
You've never relaxed in your life.
If you say so.
Just sit down.
Everyone assumes that I was born with a silver spoon in my mouth.
It's balls.
My father was an Oxfordshire auctioneer, taught me the price of everything, but the drive to create all of this, that comes from me and me alone.
Where does it come from in you?
I'm not sure I have what you describe.
OK, you patched me up, I'm very grateful for that,
- and now I'd like to go.
- Corky can't make you out, you see.
Suspicious chap, Corks.
He's got bad vibes about you.
Why did you kill that fellow in Devon?
It's all over the wire.
We had to call the police, no choice.
They'll be here any minute.
You are a cool cucumber, aren't you?
He cheated me.
And you didn't like that?
- No, I didn't.
- Quite right.
The MacArthurs have confirmed for dinner, so... that makes 12 tonight.
Or 13.
Come and tell us why you think this one's a bad apple, Corky?
Well, his references aren't too clever.
Luckily for you, old Jorge was so desperate for a sous chef, he didn't bother to check them.
You faked them, Pine?
I needed the job.
I needed it fast, I didn't have time for formalities.
Where'd you get the passport?
I met a girl... in Devon.
Didn't we all.
Pretty little thing.
Who's Quince?
Her ex.
He'd never been abroad, he'd never had a passport, so I took his name.
You've taken a lot of names, haven't you?
It makes a man wonder who you really are.
So, father killed in Belfast, no close relationship with mother, married once for six months, we can assume not a triumph.
Two tours in Iraq, distinguished service.
And on return, what?
Despair, depression, and then five years as a night owl in the hotel business.
What was that?
Hibernation?
Burying yourself alive?
And then a sudden moment of madness.
Thieving, narcotics... murder.
This is bloody chaos, Jonathan.
Do you even know who you are?
Those two chaps you smashed up in the restaurant, did you know them?
- No.
- They hadn't eaten there before?
Did they look like they'd eaten there before?
- Ever sailed a boat for them?
- Is this some kind of interrogation?
- Let's pretend it is.
Did you cook for them?
- No.
- The mussels were marvellous, by the way.
- You weren't the lookout guy?
- You didn't switch roles halfway through?
- No.
That's another of Corky's theories.
Listen, I haven't asked for anything, all right?
I don't expect a reward,
I certainly don't appreciate this investigation into my personal life.
And, frankly, I'm bored of your hospitality.
Maybe I'm not squeaky-clean, but nor, I suspect, are you and your little friend here, so maybe we just leave it at that.
- Little friend!
- I know!
Charmant!
- Where are you going?
- I'm leaving.
What are you going to do for a passport?
I have a passport in the name of Thomas Quince.
Where is it?
Corky, sock him the bad news.
The passport's gone, old love.
Thomas Quince had to be shredded.
- What are you talking about?
- It's no good getting in a panic, my dear.
Your cover's blown sky-high.
Tom Quince is on every wanted list on God's earth.
Murder, theft, sadly not buggery, but we'll work on that.
That was my passport.
That was mine!
Well, you're going to have to learn to be someone else, aren't you?
I said no-one in here!
Sorry, baby, I didn't know.
Jesus!
Sorry, my darling, I didn't know it was you.
It's actually good news.
Thomas is going to be staying for a while,
- till he's fighting fit again.
- Oh.
That's great.
You want to come for a swim?
Go on.
Corky can lend you some Speedos.
I'd like to.
Corky, why don't you put him in the fisherman's cottage at the end of the estate,
- while we work out what to do with you.
- All right, boss.
And what am I supposed to do until then?
Well, you can keep Dans company.
We were supposed to have a school friend here for the holiday, but the bugger stood him up.
His mother doesn't approve of me.
One more thing I run a tight ship here.
You're right, we do a little swashbuckling every now and then, but we play straight with each other.
Now, you saved my boy and I'm grateful, but if you step out of line... we'll make you howl for your mother.
What size feet have you got?
- 12.
- Hmm.
Now, house rules.
No phones, no postcards to Devon dumplings.
No messages in a bottle.
The chief values privacy... as do we all.
All the way down to the beach, as far as you can go, and it's on the right.
Alternatively, fill your pockets with stones, walk into the sea... and keep going.
Anything?
No.
Bloody hell!
I hate this bit.
Off every tree you may freely eat - maids, serving wenches, cooks, typists, masseuses, even the lady who comes to clip the canary's claws.
But if you lay one hand on that precious fruit, then like the Belgians in the Congo, we'll chop it off.
And I don't mean the hand.
Senor Roper.
Morning.
I was wondering if I might take Danny into town?
What for?
A change.
- He likes you, doesn't he?
- I hope so.
I like him.
Frisky and Tabby will go with you.
Pine thank you.
It's me.
They're on the move.
Do you always have this much company, Danny?
Since the restaurant.
- It's a bit boring, isn't it?
- Yeah.
Oi!
It's OK.
It's all right.
- Danny?
- Yeah.
What do you say to an ice cream?
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
- Great.
Actually why don't you ask Frisky and Tabby
- if they want an ice cream as well, huh?
- OK.
Would you like an ice cream?
- No.
- Really?
Would you?
- No.
- They didn't want one.
- They don't want one?
- No.
They are very strange, aren't they, those two?
Yeah, especially on a day like this, who wouldn't want an ice cream?
!
What's your favourite flavour, Danny?
Pistachio.
- Danny?
- Yeah?
Do you know who's...
coming to the party on Sunday?
It's a select group, around 25.
Sorry, I need to hear the complete list, all the names of all your ice creams.
Oh, gracias.
Sorry.
That's all right.
I think Sandy and Caroline will probably be there, won't they?
I don't know who's coming.
You see, I've got this problem, it's Major Corcoran.
- I don't think he likes me very much.
- Why not?
- I don't know.
But he's trying to find out everything he can about me.
All the way back to the time of the ancient Egyptians.
Mmm.
Muchos gracias.
Right, waiting's over.
We've got a spot of work to do, thank God.
- So, how often do you come here?
- Only in the summer.
It must be nice to see Dad, though?
Do you play tennis with him?
I have lessons with Lewis.
- Roper's not here much.
- Well, I expect he works hard, eh?
- That's why he has such a big house.
- I bet you've counted the rooms. - 23.
There's three kitchens and a big office by the pool.
And there's Roper's secret study in his bedroom, but no-one's allowed in there.
- Except you?
Special guest?
- I'm not.
He calls it The Citadel.
And there's one key... and he hides it.
- Do you know what's inside?
- He says it's full of peppermints.
Well, I'd lock it up too if I were him.
Plus, there's an alarm.
They test it every day at 11.
You have to be really careful.
- Why?
- This is where I cut my foot last year.
Roper made me stand in the sea for about half an hour, because of the salt.
Ever since his daughter killed herself, he comes here every day.
And that's not all.
Yesterday afternoon, he calls the hotline of the Madrid Public Prosecutor's Office, says he has information regarding a world-class illegal arms deal.
Operator asks his name, he hangs up.
Assumption, a priest's advice only goes so far.
- Gracias, padre.
- Gracias.
Mr Apostol?
Who are you?
I'm your guardian angel, Mr Apostol.
I can't sleep.
Every night...
I ask myself the same question.
What I could have done?
Now you're having a child you can understand how I feel.
I can, Juan.
When you called the Madrid office, you had blood on your hands.
And I'm here to wash it off.
How?
- You know Richard Roper?
- Yes.
- He's a friend.
- Juan, he's not a friend.
He dragged you down and he dragged your daughter down too.
If Roper wasn't in your life, I think she'd still be alive today.
Sorry.
Now, God knows how you bear it, I...
I don't think I could.
Listen, I'm on the side of the angels.
We're good people, we play it straight and we keep our promises.
OK?
But I need your help.
Do you know Lance Corcoran?
Yes.
He's Roper's right-hand man.
Right, well, that's what needs to change.
Are you pink?
Socialist, left-wing, march of history, that sort of thing?
It wouldn't bother me if you were, it's another one of Corky's bugbears.
He seems to have a few.
Yeah.
Been in a lot of foxholes, me and Corky.
Once spent a week together in a police cell in Delhi.
I don't think I've ever laughed so much in my whole life.
Was he drinking then?
Well, now, that is a deeply odd thing to say.
What business is it of yours how much he drinks?
When my father was serving in Belfast a sergeant in his platoon got drunk one night, told a local girl what the next day's operation was.
The man I loved most in the world was dead for five pints of lager and the promise of a quickie.
Right, so you don't drink and you're not pink, what are you?
Me, I'm a free man.
Free to think, free to work, free to climb a mountain or lie in bed all day eating peppermint creams without any bugger telling me how.
Then I'm a free man.
Oh, that's the free part, the man part's a little different.
See, children grow up thinking the adult world is ordered, rational, fit for purpose.
It's crap.
Becoming a man is realising...
that it's all rotten.
Realising how to celebrate that rottenness, that's freedom.
Here we are.
Out we go.
Come on.
Chop chop.
Let's go.
Mademoiselle.
- Merci, monsieur.
- OK.
Senor?
The bags, please.
Thank you so much.
Thank you so much for coming.
Have a wonderful day.
Caro, divine as ever.
Sandy, sort of acceptable.
There you go.
Apo, my dear old friend.
- I'm so terribly sorry for your loss.
- Thanks.
How are you?
I can't even imagine.
Mr Barghati, thank you so much for coming.
Please come inside.
Let's see if we can feed and sustain you before we get down to business.
And did you get the sweater?
Great.
Does it fit?
Mmm.
Uh-huh.
OK.
Love you.
Bye, honey.
I'm so sorry to interrupt.
The guests are arriving and the party's going to start soon.
The story begins in Egypt 4,500 years ago.
The ancient Egyptians invented this game.
It is literally the oldest trick in the book.
Now, you start with a ball.
We have one, two, three cups.
You lay one cup like that, one cup like that, one cup like that...
All right?
Now, I'm going to take the ball and I'm going to place the ball in the cup.
Shake the cup.
Turn it over.
All right, now, you have to watch very closely.
You have to watch the cups.
I'm going to move these two round like that.
This one round like that.
Everybody clear on where the ball is now?
Danny, where's the ball?
You think the ball's here?
No, Danny, the ball's in the middle!
You're not watching the cups, Danny.
Thomas is watching the cups, aren't you, Thomas?
You're a gym bunny, aren't you?
Aren't you?
A little cold gym bunny...
He can't stop his mouth, in every way.
Corky can get a little overexcited when he's drunk.
- Yes, that is what Mr Barghati is worried about.
- That little smile...
According to our friend, he has been shooting his mouth off, talking about things he should not.
Barghati doesn't want him involved:
condition of the deal.
- Thanks for that, Apo.
- Spit.
Yeah!
Come...
Come with me...
And it's a funny thing, isn't it?
If you want to piss...
I am so sorry to interrupt,
- but can I just borrow the old man for a second?
- Oh, of course.
- Thank you.
- Excuse me.
- Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
I have just spoken to Apo, and he has a...
There you go, Danny.
Thomas.
ROPER:
For God's sake...
Roper, Thomas and I are going to go for a little stroll.
All right, darling.
Frisky, Major Corkoran is here with some friends of Dorothy that I would like to have escorted from the premises.
You and Tabby can make as much noise as you like.
All right?
A pleasure.
Tabbs.
CORKY:
If you need to relieve yourself, it's good to do it into a suitable perspective.
It's better than a urinal, isn't it?
- God's urinal, I call this.
- You've got to break it up.
You're giving the boss indigestion with your buddies here.
- Come on, lads.
The party's over.
- Frisky, go pee-pee.
Leave your drinks here.
Frisky, don't be too rough.
Who are all these people?
How should I know?
You're not curious?
Why should I be?
It's business.
Which is what?
Buying and selling agricultural equipment.
Caro says Sandy tells her everything.
That would drive me insane.
You shouldn't have seen me like that today, in my bedroom.
I'm sorry.
The door was open.
I thought you were dressed.
That's not what I meant.
I don't care who sees me naked.
I do care who sees me crying.
You tell no-one you saw that, is that clear?
Of course.
I'm going swimming.
- Want to come?
- Ah...
I don't think that would be wise.
There's no current.
That's not quite what I meant.
I know it wasn't.
There she goes, beyond the ha-ha!
One day, Thomas, you'll live a little.
Erm, come...
Rex, do you have a minute?
The Permanent Secretary would love to see you.
Erm, yes.
- Is that a yes or a no?
- Mm-hmm.
Rex, come in.
You know Geoffrey Dromgoole, of course,
- and his team from the River.
- Rex.
Barbara Vandon from the American Embassy.
Rex Mayhew, my undersecretary.
- Good to see you, Rex.
- Barbara, how are you?
Rex, it's this Limpet thing.
Limpet?
The Joel Steadman enforcement operation with Angela Burr on side-saddle.
Yes, I know what Limpet is, it's an enforcement case.
It's nothing to do with Langley...
or River House.
Well, it's what Barbara feels we ought to be discussing.
Rex, Langley has been completely railroaded on this.
Currently, we have a joint operation on foreign soil between two extremely fringe outfits.
They're chasing international arms in an area of the world that is... way beyond their comprehension.
It's crazy.
I have to say, I agree.
You know, Limpet is operating in a highly incendiary region, and I would hate to see that run out of control.
In my view, it should be placed under a purely intelligence jurisdiction, acting on a political brief, but it's not my decision.
No, it's not.
I'm sure I don't need to remind you or your team that my recommendation, accepted by the Permanent Secretary, was that River House was overextended, and that enforcement agencies were urgently needed to prosecute any areas of international criminal activity that were,
for whatever reason, slipping through the intelligence net.
In that context, I find the actions of River House somewhat inimical to the new era of parliamentary accountability and transparency.
Does that answer your question?
- Why don't we leave it there for today?
- Thank you.
Have you got a moment?
Not much more than that:
Celia's cooking rabbit.
That's all it will take.
Good job in there.
You pressed all the right buttons:
accountability, transparency...
I don't like being bullied, never have.
You see, the thing is, I'm not sure that Limpet's quite the abject failure that Angela Burr would have us believe.
Really?
So, the day that the Limpet case is ours, you get an uncle in Switzerland who has suffered an untimely death... a rich uncle.
I'm going to pretend I didn't hear that.
- You're in over your head, Rex.
- It's...
Don't answer now... but think about it.
Enjoy the rabbit.
- Morning.
- Hi.
- Are you not swimming?
- I'm not in the mood.
I like you, Thomas.
You see everything and say nothing.
My husband is screwing our nanny.
What a cliche.
Jed said I should have hired an uglier girl, but the agency only had stunners.
Could you do my back?
Don't worry, I don't want to sleep with you.
- Why is he keeping you here?
- I don't know.
Grooming you, is he?
For what?
You just be careful.
Roper's planning a big arms deal to Apo's Lebanese friend.
Weapons from seven British and American companies, weapons no-one should be trading in.
Roper's using a company called TradePass to fence the deal.
He pretends it trades in agricultural equipment and his investors pretend to believe him.
You can stop rubbing now.
Why are you telling me this?
I just want to be honest with someone in this world.
Does Jed know?
No, of course not!
Sandy screws everyone and tells me everything.
Roper is steadfastly faithful and tells Jed nothing.
Do you think I should tell her?
Maybe.
If it's worry for your boy, forget it.
He knew what he was getting into.
Did he?
So, you and Mr Burr, are you making a go of it?
Well, you know, like my mum says, "You make your bed, you die in it."
No, Gordon's a decent man.
It's not his fault I'm not in love with him.
Listen...
Oh, Joel, let's not have that conversation, please?
Well, you can't deny the past.
- Past is all it is.
- It doesn't have to be.
Joel...
You silly sod.
Hi, Corky.
Frisky.
Hey, Danny.
Thomas, have you seen my phone?
I haven't.
Sorry.
Dad'll be cross.
Everyone's cross and Jed's not talking to Dad.
What's going on?
I don't know.
I'll tell you what, why don't I come downstairs and read you a bedtime story,
- and we can look for your phone in the morning?
- OK.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
What should we read?
I don't know.
Which one's your favourite?
Three Little Pigs.
OK, the pigs?
I can give you the Thomas version:
Two Little Pigs.
What's that?
- That right there.
Punch that up.
Punch that up.
- What is it?
It's your boy.
"Seven tractor firms", seven armament manufacturers?
"Home sale with best friend", that's the UK and the US.
"Buyer in Beirut via Worst Man".
Well, Worst Man is Roper, Roper's the middleman?
- What's TradePass?
- I'm not sure, must be a front organisation.
What I do know, though, is Roper's pressed the green light.
All right.
OK.
Hey, guys...
OK, so, just put the cases by the taxi and then you can jump in.
Good girl.
Pop in.
Jump in.
OK, put your seatbelts on, guys.
OK...
OK.
Here we go.
Get in the taxi, you bloody whore!
- Caroline, for...
- You bitch!
Caroline, for Christ's sake, she's going.
She's going.
She's go...
Caro...
Bitch!
Whore!
- Caroline.
- Just shut up!
- All right.
Just shut up, Sandy, you shit!
What, you like the show?
You like the show, Dicky?
Dicky Roper?
See you later, guys.
Jed, darling...
Don't even.
Where is everybody?
- Monaco.
- Huh.
- Two days of meetings.
Things are ramping up.
And you're not...
- You're not going too?
- Not me, no.
The girl was supposed to go but she's blown him out.
I'm staying with her.
We're going riding instead.
Didn't she invite you?
Oh, dear.
Very good.
Well, have a nice time.
JED:
I'll just be a minute.
What are you doing in here?
I brought you some flowers.
Why didn't you give them to the maids?
- I have to change.
- Close the door.
You can't be in here.
This is our bedroom.
What is that?
I found it on the desktop.
You broke into his office and you spied on his papers.
You have to be more careful.
Darling, Angel, Sweetie, everyone's starving...
- He can't see you.
- Get rid of him.
Are you decent?
- What's going on?
- Nothing.
I'm coming.
How was your trip?
Noisy.
I hitched a ride on a C-130.
Oh, fun.
How was yours?
Fine, thank you.
I'm not sure why we had to make it.
Is there a reason we're doing this in person?
Well, Halo is not too keen on intermediaries just now.
And yet he's sent you?
There's an enforcement operation called Limpet.
We have to keep our eyes on it.
Halo says you need to be careful.
I am always careful.
How far have they got?
They've drawn a line between Langbourne and Apostol.
- Jesus.
- How did they manage that?
A photograph of a meeting.
Are they after buyers or sellers?
We don't know.
We assume both.
You can assure Halo that we have taken every precaution.
We have received intelligence of our own.
We are changing the guard.
Good.
JED:
'How was your meeting?
'
It was fine.
It was fine?
Don't be so bloody childish!
Look, Caro was upset.
She wanted to get back at Sandy so she started spreading manure.
That's it.
End of story.
That's what it is, it's just a story?
Jesus, Jed, what the hell is the matter with you?
Tell me why I should believe you.
Why shouldn't you believe me?
When have I ever lied to you?
Oh, you... you don't lie to me.
You're much too clever for that.
You just hide.
What?
What do I hide?
The truth, Roper!
Well, what about your truth?
What about the things you hide from me?
I don't hide anything from you.
You have a child, Jed!
You have a son.
Let's start with him.
Or don't you think he counts?
- How do you know?
- We're not talking how, we're talking why.
Why would you hide that from me?
That was not included in the brochure.
Screw your brochure, Roper.
You don't own me.
No-one is entitled to know things about me that I don't want them to know.
Oh, but you're entitled to spy on my life?
I can read a bloody bank statement.
I'm paying money to raise another man's kid.
I know that and now anyone listening to this phone call knows it too.
Apart from that, how was your day?
On your feet, soldier.
Where the hell did he get that?
- "Halo".
- Yeah.
They're back?
Apparently so.
The chief wants to see you.
Not you, him.
Present for you on the table.
Thank you.
I told them to put some visas in it and make it look scruffy.
Never trust a new passport, in my view.
Always go with the old 'uns - like Third World taxi drivers, there's a reason they have survived.
"Andrew Birch"?
We like the tree thing.
We thought we'd stick with that.
It's all official.
You are reborn.
The visas are real.
If you want to renew, go to the consulate abroad, less risky.
- What's up?
- Erm, I thought that was my present.
Well, it can be, if you do something for me.
Right.
Sandy, papers.
Mm-hmm.
We're going to need a witness... preferably Spanish so they can't actually read the bloody thing.
I'll get Carlos.
- Is he 18?
- Yeah.
Wait, what is this?
What am I signing?
Jesus, Pine, for a murderer on the run, you're pretty bloody picky.
I am giving you your own company.
Erm...
Look, I...
Look, I really...
I don't know anything about running a company.
You don't have to.
All you have to do is sign as Andrew Birch.
Why don't you practise a few signatures?
Get the feel of it.
Andrew Birch.
B-I-R,
C for Charlie,
H for Hotel.
Go on.
Manly one.
Go for a manly one.
Andrew Birch in a hurry.
Andrew Birch.
One more.
That's more like it.
Carlos, ven aqui.
Necesito que firmes esto.
There and there and one more there.
Carlos, here, right at the bottom.
Good lad.
Welcome to the family, Andrew.
Ripped By mstoll
My darling daughter.
The most beautiful girl in the world!
A marvellous necklace from Paris!
The most expensive necklace.
Enjoy the party!
What about austerity, Apo?
This is austerity.
You should have seen our country five years ago.
- Tomorrow is business?
- Mmm-hmm.
By the way, my Arab friend is concerned you can't deliver the material you promised.
- I wouldn't worry about that, Apo.
It'll be fine.
- I hope so.
- Ah, Mr Barghati.
- Sandy.
How good to see you.
Oh, my goodness!
Oh, Lord!
Oh, Lord, what's happening here?
Que pasa?
Que pasa?
Dime que demonios pasa.
¿Qué pasa?
Jesus!
Roper, help me please.
Careful.
Elena.
Elena.
Elena!
Elena!
Elena!
She must have been in so much pain.
Yeah, well, she's caused a lot of other people pain too.
I'll have to reschedule that meeting.
Still, the canapes were good.
What do you want to do about our Arab chum?
Bring him out to the villa?
I don't much like that.
It's too risky if someone's got a watch on him.
Invite him to the children's party.
There'll be lots of people there.
You can do your magic tricks, try and get them right.
- Fix it up, will you?
- OK.
Sorry, darling.
That was a...
I don't know what I was thinking.
That was a crass thing to say.
OK.
Let's go, dream boy.
Boo.
Come on.
To the left.
Up the stairs.
So the silly sod is insisting on 10%, and he's digging his heels in.
- All right, we'll let him enjoy that for a week.
Mmm-hmm.
And then we'll take it away from him.
OK, that's fine.
Happy to go with that.
Ah, there he is.
Dans, you're on.
Thank you very much, sir, for rescuing me.
I hope you're feeling better.
You're very welcome.
All right, now scram.
See if you can catch us some mackerel for supper.
And take the dogs, will you?
Go on, Charlie, go on.
You foul-smelling creature.
- You'll call him, will you?
- Yeah, leave it with me.
I'll deal with it.
Don't waste any energy trying to sweet-talk him, just let him sweat.
All right.
All right, Frisky, no more interruptions, no one on the terrace.
What the hell is that noise?
Uh, Javier's blowing leaves.
Tell him to knock it off, will you?
Cease and desist.
How's the face?
It's fine.
You'll be all right.
So, what do you want?
I'd like to go back to the restaurant, if that's all right.
That's not what I meant.
What do you want from the world?
I don't know.
I haven't got a plan.
I'm taking some time out.
Don't believe you.
You've never relaxed in your life.
If you say so.
Just sit down.
Everyone assumes that I was born with a silver spoon in my mouth.
It's balls.
My father was an Oxfordshire auctioneer, taught me the price of everything.
But the drive to create all of this, that comes from me and me alone.
Where does it come from in you?
I'm not sure I have what you describe.
OK, you patched me up.
I'm very grateful for that.
And now I'd like to go.
Corky can't make you out, you see.
Suspicious chap, Corks.
He's got bad vibes about you.
Why'd you kill that fellow in Devon?
It's all over the wire.
We had to call the police.
No choice.
Be here any minute.
You are a cool cucumber, aren't you?
He cheated me.
You didn't like that?
- No, I didn't.
- Quite right.
The MacArthurs have confirmed for dinner.
So, that makes 12 tonight.
Or 13.
Come and tell us why you think this one's a bad apple, Corky.
Well, his references aren't too clever.
Luckily for you, although Jorge was so desperate for a sous-chef, he didn't bother to check them.
Did you fake them, Pine?
I needed the job.
I needed it fast.
I didn't have time for formalities.
Where did you get the passport?
I met a girl in Devon.
Didn't we all?
Pretty little thing.
And who's Quince?
Her ex.
He'd never been abroad.
He'd never had a passport.
So I took his name.
Taken a lot of names, haven't you?
Makes a man wonder who you really are.
So, father killed in Belfast.
No close relationship with mother.
Married once, for six months, we can assume, not a triumph.
Two tours in Iraq.
Distinguished service.
And on return, what?
Despair?
Depression?
And five years as a night owl in the hotel business.
What was that?
Hibernation?
Burying yourself alive?
And then a sudden moment of madness.
Thieving, narcotics...
Murder.
This is bloody chaos, Jonathan.
Do you even know who you are?
Those two chaps you smashed up in the restaurant.
Did you know them?
No.
Had they eaten there before?
Do they look like they'd eaten there before?
Ever sailed a boat for them?
Is this some kind of interrogation?
Let's pretend it is.
Did you cook for them?
No.
The mussels were marvellous, by the way.
So you weren't the lookout guy, you didn't switch roles halfway through?
- No.
- It's another one of Corky's little theories.
Listen, I haven't asked for anything, all right?
I don't expect a reward,
I certainly don't appreciate this investigation into my personal life, and frankly I'm bored of your hospitality.
Maybe I'm not squeaky clean.
But nor, I suspect, are you and your little friend here, so maybe just leave it at that.
- Little friend?
- I know.
Cha'mone!
- Where you going?
- I'm leaving.
What are you gonna do for a passport?
I have a passport, in the name of Thomas Quince.
Where is it?
Corky, sock him the bad news.
The passport's gone, old love.
- Thomas Quince had to be shredded.
- What are you talking about?
It's no good getting in a paddy, my dear.
Your cover's blown sky-high.
Tom Quince is on every wanted list on God's earth.
Murder, theft, sadly, not buggery, but we'll work on that.
That was my passport.
That was mine!
You're going to have to learn to be someone else, aren't you?
I said no one in here!
Sorry, baby, I didn't know.
Jesus!
Sorry, my darling, I didn't know it was you.
It's actually good news.
Thomas is going to be staying for a while, till he's fighting fit again.
Oh.
That's great.
Do you want to come for a swim?
Go on.
Corky can lend you some Speedos.
I'd like to.
Corky, we should put him in the fisherman's cottage at the end of the estate.
While we work out what to do with you.
- All right, boss.
- And what am I supposed to do until then?
You could keep Dans company.
He was supposed to have a schoolfriend here for the holiday, but the bugger stood him up.
Mother doesn't approve of me.
One more thing.
I run a tight ship here.
You're right.
We do a little swashbuckling every now and then, but we play straight with each other.
Now you saved my boy, and I'm grateful.
But if you step out of line, I will make you howl for your mother.
What size feet have you got?
Twelve.
Hmm.
Now, house rules.
No phones, no postcards to Devon dumplings.
No messages in a bottle.
The chief values privacy, as do we all.
All the way down to the beach, as far as you can go, then it's on the right.
Alternatively, fill your pockets with stones, walk into the sea, and keep going.
Anything?
No.
Bloody hell, I hate this bit.
Off every tree you may freely eat.
Maids, serving wenches, cooks, typists, masseuses, even the lady that comes to clip the canary's claws.
But if you lay one hand on that precious fruit, then like the Belgians in the Congo, we'll chop it off.
And I don't mean the hand.
Señor Roper?
Morning.
I was wondering if I might take Danny into town?
What for?
A change.
He likes you, doesn't he?
I hope so.
I like him.
Frisky and Tabby will go with you.
Pine.
Thank you.
It's me.
They're on the move.
Do you always have this much company, Danny?
Since the restaurant.
- That's a bit boring, isn't it?
- Yeah.
Whee!
It's OK.
It's all right.
Danny.
Yeah?
What do you say to an ice cream?
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Great.
Actually...
Why don't you ask Frisky and Tabby if they want an ice cream as well, eh?
OK.
Would you like an ice cream?
Really?
- Would you?
- No.
They don't want one.
- They don't want one?
- No.
They are very strange, aren't they, those two?
Yeah, especially on a day like this.
Who wouldn't want an ice cream?
- What's your favourite flavour, Danny?
- Pistachio.
Uh, dos pistachos por favor.
Danny?
- Yeah?
- Do you know who's, erm, coming to the party on Sunday?
It's a select group, around 25.
Erm, señor, por favor.
Sorry.
I need to hear the complete list.
All the names of all your ice creams.
Oh, gracias.
Sorry.
That's all right.
I think Sandy and Caroline will probably be there, won't they?
I don't know who's coming.
You see, I've got this problem.
It's Major Corkoran.
I don't think he likes me very much.
- Why not?
- I don't know.
But he's trying to find out everything he can about me.
All the way back to the time of the ancient Egyptians.
Mmm.
Muchas gracias.
Right.
Waiting's over.
We've got a spot of work to do, thank God.
So how often do you come here?
Only in the summer.
Must be nice to see your dad, though?
Do you play tennis with him?
I have lessons with Luis.
Roper's not here much.
Well, I expect he works hard, eh?
That's why he has such a big house.
Oh, I bet you've counted the rooms.
Twenty three.
There's three kitchens and the big office by the pool.
And there's Roper's secret study in his bedroom, but no one's allowed in there.
Except you, special guest?
I'm not.
He calls it the citadel.
And there's one key.
And he hides it.
Do you know what's inside?
He says it's full of peppermints.
Well, I'd lock it up too, if I were him.
Plus, there's an alarm.
They test it every day at 11.
You have to be really careful.
Why?
This is where I cut my foot last year.
Roper made me stand in the sea for about half an hour, because of the salt.
Ever since his daughter killed herself, he comes here every day.
And that's not all.
Yesterday afternoon, he calls the hotline at the Madrid public prosecutor's office, says he has information regarding a world-class illegal arms deal.
Operator asks his name, he hangs up.
Assumption, a priest's advice only goes so far.
- Gracias, padre.
- Nada.
Mr Apostol.
Who are you?
I'm your guardian angel, Mr Apostol.
I can't sleep.
Every night, I ask myself the same question...
What I could have done?
Now you're having a child...
You can understand how I feel.
Yeah, I can, Juan.
But when you called the Madrid office, you had blood on your hands.
And I'm here to wash it off.
How?
You know Richard Roper?
Yes.
He's a friend.
Juan, he's not a friend.
He dragged you down and he dragged your daughter down, too.
If Roper wasn't in your life, I think she'd still be alive today.
I'm sorry.
Now God knows how you bear it.
I, I don't think I could.
Listen, I'm on the side of the angels.
We're good people.
We play it straight and we keep our promises, OK?
But I need your help.
Do you know Lance Corkoran?
Yes.
He's Dicky Roper's right-hand man.
Right.
Well, that's what needs to change.
Are you pink?
Socialist, left wing, march of history, that sort of thing?
Wouldn't bother me if you were.
It's another one of Corky's bugbears.
He seems to have a few.
Yeah.
Been in a lot of foxholes, me and Corky.
Once spent a week together in a police cell in Delhi.
Don't think I've ever laughed so much in my whole life.
Was he drinking then?
Well, now, that is a deeply odd thing to say.
What business is it of yours how much he drinks?
When my father was serving in Belfast... a sergeant in his platoon got drunk one night, told a local girl what the next day's operation was.
The man I loved most in the world was dead for five pints of lager and the promise of a quickie.
Right.
So you don't drink and you're not pink.
What are you?
Me, I'm a free man.
Free to think, free to work.
Free to climb a mountain, or lie in bed all day eating peppermint creams, without any bugger telling me how.
Then I'm a free man.
Oh, that's the free part.
The man part's a little different.
You see, children grow up thinking the adult world is ordered, rational, fit for purpose.
It's crap.
Becoming a man is realising that it's all rotten.
Realising how to celebrate that rottenness, that's freedom.
Here we are.
Out we get.
Come on.
Chop, chop.
Let's go.
Mademoiselle.
Merci, monsieur.
Uh, Señor.
The bags, please.
Thank you so much.
Thank you so much for coming.
Have a wonderful day.
Carol, you look divine, as ever.
Sandy, sort of acceptable.
Apo, my dear old friend.
I'm so terribly sorry for your loss.
Thanks.
How are you?
I can't even imagine.
Mr Barghati, thank you so much for coming.
Please come inside.
Let's see if we can feed and sustain you before we get down to business.
And did you get the sweater?
Great.
Does it fit?
Mmm.
OK.
Bye.
I'm so sorry to interrupt.
The guests are arriving and the party's gonna start soon.
The story begins in Egypt, four-and-a-half thousand years ago.
The ancient Egyptians invented this game.
This is literally the oldest trick in the book.
Now, we start with a ball.
We have one, two, three cups.
We turn one cup like that, one cup like that, one cup like that.
All right, now, I'm gonna take the ball, and I'm gonna place the ball in the cup.
Shake the cup, turn it over.
Right, now.
You've to watch very closely.
You have to watch the cups.
I'm going to move these two round like that, and this one round like that.
Everybody clear where the ball is now?
Danny, where's the ball?
You think the ball's here?
No, Danny, the ball is in the middle.
You're not watching the cups, Danny.
Thomas is watching the cups, aren't you, Thomas?
You're a gym bunny.
I am.
You're a cold gym bunny.
He can't stop his mouth, in every way.
Corky can get a little over-excited when he's drunk.
Yes, that is what Mr Barghati is worried about.
According to my friends, he has been shooting his mouth off, talking about things he should not.
Barghati doesn't want him involved.
Condition of the deal.
Thanks for that, Apo.
Come.
Come with me.
It's a funny thing to do.
If you want to piss...
I am so sorry to interrupt.
But can I just borrow the old man for a second?
- Oh, of course.
- Thank you.
- Excuse me.
- Bye.Bye.
I've just spoken to Apo.
He has...
There you go, Danny.
Thomas.
For God's sake.
Roper, Thomas and I are gonna go for a little stroll.
All right, darling.
Frisky, Major Corkoran is here with some friends of Dorothy, that I would like to have escorted from the premises.
You and Tabby can make as much noise as you like, right?
...If you need to relieve yourself, it's good to do it into a suitable perspective.
It's better than a urinal, isn't it?
God's urinal, I call it.
Break it up, you're giving the boss indigestion with your buddies here.
Come on, lads, party's over.
Leave your drinks here.
Frisky, don't be too rough.
Who are all these people?
How should I know?
You're not curious?
Why should I be?
It's business.
Which is what?
Buying and selling...
Agricultural equipment.
Caro says Sandy tells her everything.
That'd drive me insane.
You shouldn't have seen me like that today, in my bedroom.
I'm sorry.
The door was open,
- I thought you were dressed.
- That's not what I meant.
I don't care who sees me naked.
I do care who sees me crying.
You tell no one you saw that, is that clear?
Of course.
I'm going swimming.
Wanna come?
Er, I don't think that would be wise.
There's no current.
That's not quite what I meant.
I know it wasn't.
There she goes.
Beyond the ha-ha!
One day, Thomas, you'll live a little.
Er...
Come.
Rex, do you have a minute?
The Permanent Secretary would love to see you.
Erm, yes.
- Was that a yes or a no?
- Mmm-hmm.
Rex, come in.
- You know Geoffrey Dromgoole, of course,
- Geoffrey.
- And his team from the River.
- Rex.
Barbara Vandon, from the American Embassy.
Rex Mayhew, my under secretary.
- Good to see you, Rex.
- Barbara, how are you?
- Rex, it's this Limpet thing.
- Limpet?
The Joel Steadman enforcement operation, with Angela Burr on side-saddle.
Yes, I know what Limpet is.
It's an enforcement case, nothing to do with Langley, or River House.
Well, it's what Barbara feels we ought to be discussing.
Rex, Langley has been completely railroaded on this.
Currently, we have a joint operation on foreign soil between two extremely fringe outfits.
They're chasing international arms in an area of the world that is...
Way beyond their comprehension.
It's crazy.
I have to say I agree.
Limpet is operating in a highly incendiary region.
And I would hate to see that run out of control.
I mean, in my view, it should be placed under a purely Intelligence jurisdiction...
Acting on a political brief.
But it's not my decision.
No, it's not.
I'm sure I don't need to remind you or your team that my recommendation, uh, accepted by the Permanent Secretary, was that River House was over-extended, and that enforcement agencies were urgently needed to prosecute any areas of international criminal activity
that were, for whatever reason, slipping through the Intelligence net.
In that context, I find the actions of River House somewhat inimical to the new era of parliamentary accountability and transparency.
Does that answer your question?
- Why don't we leave it there for today?
- Thank you.
Have you got a moment?
Ah, not much more than that.
Celia's cooking rabbit.
That's all it will take.
Good job in there.
Pressed all the right buttons, accountability, transparency.
I don't like being bullied.
Never have.
See, the thing is, I'm not sure that Limpet is quite the abject failure that Angela Burr would have us believe.
Really?
So, the day that the Limpet case is ours, you get an uncle in Switzerland who has suffered an untimely death.
A rich uncle.
I'm going to pretend I didn't hear that.
You're in over your head, Rex.
- Don't tell me...
- Don't answer now.
Think about it.
Enjoy the rabbit.
- Morning.
- Hi.
- You're not swimming?
- Not in the mood.
I like you, Thomas.
You see everything and say nothing.
My husband is screwing our nanny.
What a cliché.
Jed said I should have hired an uglier girl.
But the agency only had stunners.
Could you do my back?
Don't worry.
I don't want to sleep with you.
Why's he keeping you here?
- I don't know.
- Grooming you, is he?
For what?
You just be careful.
Roper's planning a big arms deal to Apo's Lebanese friend.
Weapons from seven British and American companies.
Weapons no one should be trading in.
Roper's using a company called Tradepass to fence the deal.
He pretends it trades in agricultural equipment.
His investors pretend to believe him.
You can stop rubbing now.
Why are you telling me this?
I just want to be honest with someone in this world.
Does Jed know?
No.
Of course not.
Sandy screws everyone and tells me everything.
Roper is steadfastly faithful and tells Jed nothing.
Do you think I should tell her?
Maybe.
If it's worry for your boy, forget it.
He knew what he was getting into.
Did he?
So, you and Mr Burr...
Making a go of it?
Well, you know, like my mum says, "You make your bed, you die in it."
No, Gordon's a decent man.
It's not his fault I'm not in love with him.
Listen.
Oh, Joel, let's not have that conversation.
Please.
Well, you can't deny the past.
- The past is all it is.
- It doesn't have to be.
Joel...
You silly sod.
Hi, Corky.
Frisky.
Hey, Danny.
Thomas, have you seen my phone?
I haven't.
Sorry.
Dad'll be cross.
Everyone's cross.
And Jed's not talking to Dad.
What's going on?
I don't know.
I tell you what, why don't I come downstairs and read you a bedtime story, and we can look for your phone in the morning?
- Okay.
- Yeah?
Yeah.
What shall we read?
Don't know.
Which one's your favourite?
The Three Little Pigs.
Little Pigs?
I can give you the Thomas version of Two Little Pigs.
What's that?
That right there.
Punch that out.
Punch that out.
What is it?
It's your boy.
Seven tractor firms.
Seven armament manufacturers.
Home sale with best friend, that's UK and US.
Buyer in Beirut via Worst Man.
Worst Man's Roper.
Roper's the middle man.
- What's Tradepass?
- Not sure.
Must be a front organisation.
What I do know, though, is Roper's pressed the green light.
Right.
Hey, guys?
Okay, so just put the cases by the taxi and then you can jump in.
Good girl.
Pop in. jump in.
Okay, put your seatbelts on, guys.
Okay.
Okay.
Here we go.
Get in the taxi, you bloody whore!
- Caroline...
Caroline!
- You bitch!
For Christ's sake, she's going, she's going.
She's go...
- Caro...
- Bitch!
- Whore!
- Caroline!
- Just shut up!
- All right.
Just shut up, Sandy, you shit!
Do you like the show?
Do you like the show, Dicky?
Dicky Roper!
See you later, guys.
- Jed, darling...
- Don't even...
Where is everybody?
- Monaco.
- Oh.
Two days of meetings.
Things are ramping up.
And you're not, uh...
You're not going too?
Not me, no.
The girl was supposed to go, but she's blown him out.
I'm staying with her.
We're going riding instead.
Didn't she invite you?
Oh, dear.
Very good.
Well, have a nice time.
I'll just be a minute.
What are you doing in here?
I brought you some flowers.
Why didn't you give them to the maids?
- I have to change.
- Close the door.
You can't be in here.
This is our bedroom.
What is that?
I found it on the desktop.
You broke into his office and you spied on his papers.
You have to be more careful.
Darling, angel, sweet cheeks, everyone's starving.
- He can't see you.
- Get rid of him.
Are you decent?
- What's going on?
- Nothing.
I'm coming.
How was your trip?
Noisy.
I hitched a ride on a C130.
- Oh, fun.
- How was yours?
Fine, thank you.
Not sure why we had to make it.
Is there a reason we're doing this in person?
Well, Halo is not too keen on intermediaries just now.
And yet he sent you?
There's an enforcement operation called Limpet.
We have to keep our eyes on it.
Halo says you need to be careful.
I am always careful.
How far have they got?
They've drawn a line between Langbourne and Apostol.
- Jesus.
- How did they manage that?
Photograph of a meeting.
They after buyers or sellers?
We don't know.
We assume both.
You can assure Halo that we have taken every precaution.
We have received intelligence of our own.
We are changing the guard.
Good.
How was your meeting?
It was fine.
- It was fine.
- Don't be so bloody childish.
Look, Caro was upset.
She wanted to get back at Sandy, so she started spreading manure.
That's it.
End of story.
That's what it is?
It's just a story?
Jesus Jed, what the hell is the matter with you?
Tell me why I should believe you.
Why shouldn't you believe me?
When have I ever lied to you?
Oh, you don't lie to me.
You're much too clever for that.
You just hide.
What?
What do I hide?
The truth, Roper.
What about your truth?
What about the things you hide from me?
I don't hide anything from you.
You have a child, Jed!
You have a son.
Let's start with him.
Or don't you think he counts?
How do you know that?
We're not talking how, we're talking why.
Why would you hide that from me?
That was not included in the brochure.
Screw your brochure, Roper.
You don't own me.
No one is entitled to know things about me that I don't want them to know.
Oh, but you're entitled to spy on my life?
I can read a bloody bank statement.
I'm paying money to raise another man's kid.
I know that.
Now anyone listening to this phone call knows it too.
Apart from that, how was your day?
On your feet, soldier.
Where the hell did he get that?
- Halo?
- Yeah.
They're back?
Apparently so.
Chief wants to see you.
Not you.
Him.
Present for you.
On the table.
- Thank you.
- Told them to put visas in it, make it look scruffy.
Never trust a new passport, in my view.
Always go with the old 'uns.
Like third-world taxi drivers.
There's a reason they've survived.
Andrew Birch.
We liked the tree thing, thought we'd stick with that.
It's all official.
You are reborn.
Visas are real.
If you want to renew, do it at a consulate abroad, less risky.
What's up?
I thought that was my, uh, present.
Well, it can be, if you do something for me.
Right.
Sandy, papers.
Mmm-hmm.
I'm going to need a witness.
Preferably Spanish, so they can't actually read the bloody thing.
I'll get Carlos.
- Is he 18?
- Yeah.
Wait, what... what is this?
What am I signing?
Jesus, Pine, for a murderer on the run, you're pretty bloody picky.
I am giving you your own company.
Uh, look, I don't know anything about running a company.
Don't have to.
All you have to do is sign as Andrew Birch.
Why don't you practise a few signatures, get the feel of it?
Andrew Birch.
B-I-R...
C for Charlie.
H for Hotel.
Go on.
A manly one.
Go for a manly one.
Andrew Birch in a hurry.
Andrew Birch.
One more.
That's more like it.
There and there, and another one there.
Carlos, you write at the bottom.
Good lad.
Welcome to the family, Andrew.

[LATIN DANCE MUSIC]
[CORKY LAUGHS]
Thank you.
What about austerity, Apo?
- This is austerity.
- [LAUGHS]
You should have seen our country five years ago.
- Tomorrow's business...
- Uh-huh?
By the way, my Arab friend is concerned you can't deliver the merchandise you promised.
I wouldn't worry about that, Apo, it'll be fine.
I hope so.
- Ah, Mr Barghati.
- Sandy.
How good to see you.
[LATIN DANCE MUSIC]
[SHE WHIMPERS]
Oh, my goodness!
Oh, Lord!
Oh, Lord!
What's happening here?
[MAID SOBS]
- [SHE WHIMPERS]
- Qué pasa?
Qué pasa?
- Qué pasa?
- [SHE SOBS]
[MAID SOBS]
[LATIN DANCE MUSIC]
- Jesus!
- Help her!
Help me, please!
[GASPING] Elena!
Elena!
Elena!
Elena!
Elena!
She must've been in so much pain.
Yeah, well, she's caused a lot of other people pain, too.
We had to reschedule that meeting.
Still, the canapes were good.
What do you want to do about our Arab chum?
Bring him out to the villa?
I don't much like that, it's too risky if someone's got a watch on him.
Invite him to the children's party.
There'll be lots of people there, you can do your magic tricks.
Try and get them right.
- Fix it up, will you?
- OK.
Sorry, darling, I don't know what I was thinking, it was a crass thing to say.
_
- [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] - [SCOFFS]
OK... let's go, dream boy.
Huh!
Come on.
Go left.
Up the stairs.
So the silly sod is insisting on 10% and he is digging his heels in.
All right, we'll let him enjoy that for a week, and then we'll take it away from him.
Yeah, that's fine.
I'm happy to go with that.
Ah, there he is.
Dans, you're on.
Thank you very much, sir, for rescuing me.
I hope you're feeling better.
[CHUCKLES]
You're very welcome.
All right, now scram.
See if you can catch us some mackerel for supper.
And take the dogs, will you?
Go on, Shirley.
Go on, you foul-smelling creature.
You'll call him, will you?
Yep.
Leave it with me, I'll deal with it.
Don't waste any energy trying to sweet-talk him,
- just lay it out, let him sweat.
- All right.
All right, Frisky, no more interruptions,
- no-one on the terrace.
- [BUZZING]
- What the hell is that noise?
- Oh, Javier is blowing leaves.
Well, tell him to knock it off, will you?
Cease and desist.
How's the face?
- It's fine.
- We'll be all right.
- So, what do you want?
- I'd like to... to go back to the restaurant, if that's all right.
That's not what I meant.
What do you want... from the world?
[LEAF BLOWER STOPS]
I don't know.
I haven't got a plan.
I'm taking some time out.
Don't believe you.
You've never relaxed in your life.
If you say so.
Just sit down.
[ROPER SIGHS]
Everyone assumes that I was born with a silver spoon in my mouth.
It's balls.
My father was an Oxfordshire auctioneer, taught me the price of everything, but the drive to create all of this, that comes from me and me alone.
Where does it come from in you?
I'm not sure I have what you describe.
OK, you patched me up, I'm very grateful for that, and now I'd like to go.
Corky can't make you out, you see.
Suspicious chap, Corks.
He's got bad vibes about you.
Why did you kill that fellow in Devon?
It's all over the wire.
We had to call the police, no choice.
They'll be here any minute.
You are a cool cucumber, aren't you?
He cheated me.
And you didn't like that?
- No, I didn't.
- Quite right.
The MacArthurs have confirmed for dinner, so... that makes 12 tonight.
Or 13.
Come and tell us why you think this one's a bad apple, Corky?
Well, his references aren't too clever.
Luckily for you, old Jorge was so desperate for a sous chef, he didn't bother to check them.
You faked them, Pine?
I needed the job.
I needed it fast, I didn't have time for formalities.
Where'd you get the passport?
I met a girl... in Devon.
Didn't we all.
Pretty little thing.
Who's Quince?
Her ex.
He'd never been abroad, he'd never had a passport, so I took his name.
You've taken a lot of names, haven't you?
It makes a man wonder who you really are.
So, father killed in Belfast, no close relationship with mother, married once for six months, we can assume not a triumph.
Two tours in Iraq, distinguished service.
And on return, what?
Despair, depression, and then five years as a night owl in the hotel business.
What was that?
Hibernation?
Burying yourself alive?
And then a sudden moment of madness.
Thieving, narcotics... murder.
[ROPER CHUCKLES SOFTLY]
This is bloody chaos, Jonathan.
Do you even know who you are?
Those two chaps you smashed up in the restaurant, did you know them?
No.
They hadn't eaten there before?
Did they look like they'd eaten there before?
- Ever sailed a boat for them?
- Is this some kind of interrogation?
Let's pretend it is.
Did you cook for them?
No.
The mussels were marvellous, by the way.
So you weren't the lookout guy?
- You didn't switch roles halfway through?
- No.
That's another one of Corky's little theories.
Listen, I haven't asked for anything, all right?
I don't expect a reward,
I certainly don't appreciate this investigation into my personal life.
And, frankly, I'm bored of your hospitality.
Maybe I'm not squeaky-clean, but nor, I suspect, are you and your little friend here, so maybe we just leave it at that.
- Little friend!
- I know!
Charmant!
- Where are you going?
- I'm leaving.
What are you going to do for a passport?
I have a passport in the name of Thomas Quince.
Where is it?
Corky, sock him the bad news.
The passport's gone, old love.
Thomas Quince had to be shredded.
- What are you talking about?
- It's no good getting in a panic, my dear.
Your cover's blown sky-high.
Tom Quince is on every wanted list on God's earth.
Murder, theft, sadly not buggery, but we'll work on that.
That was my passport.
That was mine!
Well, you're going to have to learn to be someone else, aren't you?
[DOOR OPENS]
I said no-one in here!
Sorry, baby, I didn't know.
Jesus!
Sorry, my darling, I didn't know it was you.
It's actually good news.
Thomas is going to be staying for a while,
- till he's fighting fit again.
- Oh.
That's great.
You want to come for a swim?
Go on.
Corky can lend you some Speedos.
- I'd like to.
- [SHE LAUGHS]
Corky, why don't you put him in the fisherman's cottage at the end of the estate...
- while we work out what to do with you.
- All right, boss.
And what am I supposed to do until then?
Well, you can keep Dans company.
We were supposed to have a school friend here for the holiday, but the bugger stood him up.
His mother doesn't approve of me.
One more thing...
I run a tight ship here.
You're right, we do a little swashbuckling every now and then, but we play straight with each other.
Now, you saved my boy and I'm grateful, but if you step out of line... we'll make you howl for your mother.
What size feet have you got?
- 12.
- Hmm.
Now, house rules.
No phones, no postcards to Devon dumplings.
No messages in a bottle.
The chief values privacy... as do we all.
All the way down to the beach, as far as you can go, and it's on the right.
Alternatively, fill your pockets with stones, walk into the sea... and keep going.
Anything?
- No.
- [SHE SIGHS]
Bloody hell!
I hate this bit.
_
Off every tree you may freely eat... maids, serving wenches, cooks, typists, masseuses, even the lady who comes to clip the canary's claws.
But if you lay one hand on that precious fruit, then like the Belgians in the Congo, we'll chop it off.
And I don't mean the hand.
Senor Roper.
Morning.
I was wondering if I might take Danny into town?
What for?
A change.
- He likes you, doesn't he?
- I hope so.
I like him.
Frisky and Tabby will go with you.
Pine thank you.
It's me.
They're on the move.
[BIRDSONG]
Do you always have this much company, Danny?
Since the restaurant.
- It's a bit boring, isn't it?
- Yeah.
Oi!
[DANNY GASPS]
It's OK.
It's all right.
[DANNY LAUGHS]
- Danny?
- Yeah.
What do you say... to an ice cream?
- Yeah?
Great.
- Yeah.
Actually...
[JONATHAN GRUNTS] ...why don't you ask Frisky and Tabby if they want an ice cream as well, huh?
OK.
- Would you like an ice cream?
- No.
- Really?
Would you?
- No.
They didn't want one.
- They don't want one?
- No.
They are very strange, aren't they, those two?
Yeah, especially on a day like this,
- who wouldn't want an ice cream?
!
- [LAUGHS]
What's your favourite flavour, Danny?
- Pistachio.
- Dos pistachios, por favor.
Aahora mismo.
- Danny?
- Yeah?
Do you know who's... coming to the party on Sunday?
It's a select group, around 25.
Senior, por favor...
Sorry, I need to hear the complete list, all the names of all your ice creams.
Oh, gracias.
Sorry.
That's all right.
I think Sandy and Caroline will probably be there, won't they?
I don't know who's coming.
You see, I've got this problem, it's Major Corcoran.
I don't think he likes me very much.
- Why not?
- I don't know.
But he's trying to find out everything he can about me.
All the way back to the time of the ancient Egyptians.
[THEY LAUGH]
Mmm.
Muchos gracias.
Right, waiting's over.
- We've got a spot of work to do,
- All right, come on.
thank God.
- So, how often do you come here?
- Only in the summer.
It must be nice to see Dad, though?
Do you play tennis with him?
I have lessons with Lewis.
- Roper's not here much.
- Well, I expect he works hard, eh?
- That's why he has such a big house.
- I bet you've counted the rooms.
23.
There's three kitchens and a big office by the pool.
And there's Roper's secret study in his bedroom, but no-one's allowed in there.
- Except you?
Special guest?
- I'm not.
He calls it The Citadel.
And there's one key... and he hides it.
Do you know what's inside?
He says it's full of peppermints.
Well, I'd lock it up too if I were him.
[THEY LAUGH]
Plus, there's an alarm.
They test it every day at 11.
You have to be really careful.
Why?
This is where I cut my foot last year.
Roper made me stand in the sea for about half an hour, because of the salt.
[CHURCH BELL CHIMES]
_
Ever since his daughter killed herself, he comes here every day.
And that's not all.
Yesterday afternoon, he calls the hotline of the Madrid Public Prosecutor's Office, says he has information regarding a world-class illegal arms deal.
Operator asks his name, he hangs up.
Assumption, a priest's advice only goes so far.
[PRIEST SPEAKS SPANISH]
- Gracias, padre.
- Gracias.
Mr Apostol?
Who are you?
I'm your guardian angel, Mr Apostol.
I can't sleep.
Every night...
I ask myself the same question.
What I could have done?
[HE SOBS]
[SNIFFLES]
Now you're having a child you can understand how I feel.
I can, Juan.
When you called the Madrid office, you had blood on your hands.
And I'm here to wash it off.
How?
- You know Richard Roper?
- Yes.
- He's a friend.
- Juan, he's not a friend.
He dragged you down and he dragged your daughter down too.
If Roper wasn't in your life, I think she'd still be alive today.
Sorry.
Now, God knows how you bear it, I...
I don't think I could.
Listen, I'm on the side of the angels.
We're good people, we play it straight and we keep our promises.
OK?
But I need your help.
Do you know Lance Corcoran?
Yes.
He's Dicky Roper's right-hand man.
Right, well, that's what needs to change.
Are you pink?
Socialist, left-wing, march of history, that sort of thing?
It wouldn't bother me if you were, it's another one of Corky's bugbears.
He seems to have a few.
Yeah.
Been in a lot of foxholes, me and Corky.
Once spent a week together in a police cell in Delhi.
I don't think I've ever laughed so much in my whole life.
Was he drinking then?
Well, now, that is a deeply odd thing to say.
What business is it of yours how much he drinks?
When my father was serving in Belfast a sergeant in his platoon got drunk one night, told a local girl what the next day's operation was.
The man I loved most in the world was dead for five pints of lager and the promise of a quickie.
Right, so you don't drink and you're not pink, what are you?
Me, I'm a free man.
Free to think, free to work, free to climb a mountain or lie in bed all day eating peppermint creams without any bugger telling me how.
Then I'm a free man.
Oh, that's the free part, the man part's a little different.
See, children grow up thinking the adult world is ordered, rational, fit for purpose.
It's crap.
Becoming a man is realising... that it's all rotten.
Realising how to celebrate that rottenness, that's freedom.
SANDY:
Here we are.
WOMAN:
Out we go.
[SANDY GROANS]
Come on.
Chop chop.
Let's go.
Mademoiselle.
[SHE GIGGLES]
- Merci, monsieur.
- OK.
Senor?
The bags, please.
Thank you so much.
[DOOR CLOSES]
Thank you so much for coming.
Have a wonderful day.
Caro, divine as ever.
- Sandy, sort of acceptable.
- There you go.
Apo, my dear old friend.
- I'm so terribly sorry for your loss.
- Thanks.
How are you?
I can't even imagine.
Mr Barghati, thank you so much for coming.
Please come inside.
Let's see if we can feed and sustain you before we get down to business.
And did you get the sweater?
Great.
Does it fit?
Mmm.
Uh-huh.
OK.
Love you.
Bye, honey.
[SHE SOBS]
- [KNOCK AT DOOR] - [SHE GASPS]
I'm so sorry to interrupt.
The guests are arriving and the party's going to start soon.
The story begins in Egypt 4,500 years ago.
The ancient Egyptians invented this game.
It is literally the oldest trick in the book.
Now, you start with a ball.
We have one, two, three cups.
You lay one cup like that, one cup like that, one cup like that...
All right?
Now, I'm going to take the ball and I'm going to place the ball in the cup.
Shake the cup.
Turn it over.
All right, now, you have to watch very closely.
You have to watch the cups.
I'm going to move these two round like that.
This one round like that.
Everybody clear on where the ball is now?
Danny, where's the ball?
You think the ball's here?
- No, Danny, the ball's in the middle!
- [LAUGHTER]
You're not watching the cups, Danny.
Thomas is watching the cups, aren't you, Thomas?
You're a gym bunny, aren't you?
Aren't you?
A little cold gym bunny...
He can't stop his mouth... in every way.
Corky can get a little overexcited when he's drunk.
Yes, that is what Mr Barghati is worried about.
That little smile...
According to our friend, he has been shooting his mouth off... talking about things he should not.
Barghati doesn't want him involved... condition of the deal.
- Thanks for that, Apo.
- CORKY:
Spit.
Yeah!
[LAUGHS]
Come...
Come with me...
And it's a funny thing, isn't it?
If you want to piss...
I am so sorry to interrupt, but can I just borrow the old man for a second?
- Oh, of course.
- Thank you.
- Excuse me.
- Bye.
Bye.
I have just spoken to Apo, and he has a...
There you go, Danny.
Thomas.
ROPER:
For God's sake...
Roper,
Thomas and I are going to go for a little stroll.
All right, darling.
Frisky, Major Corkoran is here with some friends of Dorothy that I would like to have escorted from the premises.
You and Tabby can make as much noise as you like.
All right?
- A pleasure.
- Tabbs.
CORKY:
If you need to relieve yourself, it's good to do it into a suitable perspective.
It's better than a urinal, isn't it?
- God's urinal, I call this.
- You've got to break it up.
You're giving the boss indigestion with your buddies here.
- Come on, lads.
The party's over.
- Frisky, go pee-pee.
Leave your drinks here.
Frisky, don't be too rough.
[WATER SPLASHES]
Who are all these people?
How should I know?
You're not curious?
Why should I be?
- It's business.
- Which is what?
Buying and selling agricultural equipment.
Caro says Sandy tells her everything.
That would drive me insane.
You shouldn't have seen me like that today, in my bedroom.
I'm sorry.
The door was open.
I thought you were dressed.
That's not what I meant.
I don't care who sees me naked.
I do care who sees me crying.
You tell no-one you saw that, is that clear?
Of course.
I'm going swimming.
- Want to come?
- Ah...
I don't think that would be wise.
There's no current.
[DRESS UNZIPS]
That's not quite what I meant.
I know it wasn't.
[HE SIGHS]
There she goes, beyond the ha-ha!
One day, Thomas, you'll live a little.

- [TRAFFIC RUMBLES] - [SIRENS WAIL]
_
- [KNOCK AT DOOR]
- Erm, come...
Rex, do you have a minute?
The Permanent Secretary would love to see you.
Erm, yes.
- Is that a yes or a no?
- Mm-hmm.
- [DOOR OPENS]
- Rex, come in.
- You know Geoffrey Dromgoole, of course,
- Geoffrey.
- and his team from the River.
- Rex.
Barbara Vandon from the American Embassy.
Rex Mayhew, my undersecretary.
- Good to see you, Rex.
- Barbara, how are you?
Rex, it's this Limpet thing.
Limpet?
The Joel Steadman enforcement operation with Angela Burr on side-saddle.
Yes, I know what Limpet is...
it's an enforcement case.
It's nothing to do with Langley... or River House.
Well, it's what Barbara feels we ought to be discussing.
Rex, Langley has been completely railroaded on this.
Currently, we have a joint operation on foreign soil between two extremely fringe outfits.
They're chasing international arms in an area of the world that is... way beyond their comprehension.
It's crazy.
I have to say, I agree.
You know, Limpet is operating in a highly incendiary region, and I would hate to see that run out of control.
In my view, it should be placed under a purely intelligence jurisdiction, acting on a political brief,
- but, it's not my decision.
- [SIRENS WAIL]
No, it's not.
I'm sure I don't need to remind you or your team that my recommendation, accepted by the Permanent Secretary, was that River House was overextended, and that enforcement agencies were urgently needed to prosecute any areas of international criminal activity that were,
for whatever reason, slipping through the intelligence net.
In that context, I find the actions of River House somewhat inimical to the new era of parliamentary accountability and transparency.
Does that answer your question?
- Why don't we leave it there for today?
- Thank you.
[DOOR OPENS AND SLAMS]
Have you got a moment?
Not much more than that...
Celia's cooking rabbit.
- That's all it will take.
- [HE SNIFFS]
Good job in there.
You pressed all the right buttons...
accountability, transparency...
I don't like being bullied, never have.
You see, the thing is, I'm not sure that Limpet's quite the abject failure that Angela Burr would have us believe.
Really?
So, the day that the Limpet case is ours, you get an uncle in Switzerland who has suffered an untimely death... a rich uncle.
I'm going to pretend I didn't hear that.
You're in over your head, Rex.
- It's...
- Don't answer now... but think about it.
Enjoy the rabbit.
- Morning.
- Hi.
- Are you not swimming?
- I'm not in the mood.
I like you, Thomas...
You see everything and say nothing.
[SHE SOBS]
My husband is screwing our nanny.
[SNIFFLES]
What a cliché.
Jed said I should have hired an uglier girl but the agency only had stunners. [SHE SNIFFLES]
Could you do my back?
Don't worry, I don't want to sleep with you.
- Why is he keeping you here?
- I don't know.
Grooming you, is he?
For what?
You just be careful.
Roper's planning a big arms deal to Apo's Lebanese friend.
Weapons from seven British and American companies... weapons no-one should be trading in.
Roper's using a company called TradePass to fence the deal.
He pretends it trades in agricultural equipment and his investors pretend to believe him.
You can stop rubbing now.
Why are you telling me this?
I just want to be honest with someone in this world.
Does Jed know?
No, of course not!
Sandy screws everyone and tells me everything.
Roper is steadfastly faithful and tells Jed nothing.
Do you think I should tell her?
Maybe.
[HE GRUNTS]
If it's worry for your boy, forget it.
He knew what he was getting into.
Did he?
So, you and Mr Burr, are you making a go of it?
Well, you know, like my mum says, "You make your bed... you die in it."
[HE CHUCKLES]
No, Gordon's a decent man.
It's not his fault I'm not in love with him.
Listen...
Oh, Joel, let's not have that conversation, please?
Well, you can't deny the past.
- Past is all it is.
- It doesn't have to be.
[SHE SIGHS]
Joel...
You silly sod.

[BIRDS TWITTER]
Hi, Corky.
Frisky.
Hey, Danny.
Thomas, have you seen my phone?
I haven't.
Sorry.
Dad'll be cross.
Everyone's cross and Jed's not talking to Dad.
What's going on?
I don't know.
I'll tell you what, why don't I come downstairs and read you a bedtime story, and we can look for your phone in the morning?
OK.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
What should we read?
I don't know.
Which one's your favourite?
Three Little Pigs.
OK, the pigs?
I can give you the Thomas version...
Two Little Pigs.
No.
[HE EXHALES]
- [COMPUTER BEEPS]
- What's that?
That right there.
Punch that up.
Punch that up.
What is it?
[COMPUTER BEEPS]
It's your boy.
"Seven tractor firms"...
seven armament manufacturers?
"Home sale with best friend", that's the UK and the US.
"Buyer in Beirut via Worst Man".
Well, Worst Man is Roper.
Roper's the middleman?
- What's TradePass?
- I'm not sure, must be a front organisation.
What I do know, though, is Roper's pressed the green light.
All right.
OK.
Hey, guys...
OK, so, just put the cases by the taxi and then you can jump in.
Good girl.
Pop in.
Jump in.
OK, put your seatbelts on, guys.
[CARO CRIES SOFTLY]
OK...
- OK.
Here we go.

Caroline, for Christ's sake, she's going.
She's going.
She's go...

- Bitch!
- Whore!
- Caroline.
- Just shut up!
- All right.
Just shut up, Sandy, you shit!
What, you like the show?
You like the show, Dicky?
Dicky Roper?
[CAR ENGINE REVS]
See you later, guys.
Jed, darling...
Don't even.
Where is everybody?
- Monaco.
- Huh.
Two days of meetings.
Things are ramping up.
And you're not...
- You're not going too?
- Not me, no.
The girl was supposed to go but she's blown him out.
I'm staying with her.
We're going riding instead.
Didn't she invite you?

Why didn't you give them to the maids?

- Close the door.
You can't be in here.
This is our bedroom.
What is that?
I found it on the desktop.
You broke into his office and you spied on his papers.
You have to be more careful.
CORKY:
Darling, Angel, Sweetie, everyone's starving...
- He can't see you.
- Get rid of him.
Are you decent?
- What's going on?
- Nothing.
I'm coming.

How was your trip?
Noisy.
I hitched a ride on a C-130.
- Oh, fun.
- How was yours?
Fine, thank you.
I'm not sure why we had to make it.
Is there a reason we're doing this in person?
Well, Halo is not too keen on intermediaries just now.
And yet he's sent you?
There's an enforcement operation called Limpet.
We have to keep our eyes on it.
Halo says you need to be careful.
I am always careful.
How far have they got?
They've drawn a line between Langbourne and Apostol.
- Jesus.
- How did they manage that?
A photograph of a meeting.
Are they after buyers or sellers?
We don't know.
We assume both.
You can assure Halo that we have taken every precaution.
We have received intelligence of our own.
We are changing the guard.
Good.
JED:
How was your meeting?
It was fine.
It was fine?
Don't be so bloody childish!
Look, Caro was upset.
She wanted to get back at Sandy so she started spreading manure.
That's it.
End of story.
That's what it is... it's just a story?
Jesus, Jed, what the hell is the matter with you?
Tell me why I should believe you.
Why shouldn't you believe me?
- When have I ever lied to you?
- Oh, you... you don't lie to me.
You're much too clever for that.
You just hide.
- What?
What do I hide?
- The truth, Roper!
Well, what about your truth?
What about the things you hide from me?
I don't hide anything from you.
You have a child, Jed!
You have a son.
Let's start with him.
Or don't you think he counts?
How do you know that?
We're not talking how, we're talking why.
Why would you hide that from me?
That was not included in the brochure.
Screw your brochure, Roper.
You don't own me.
No-one is entitled to know things about me that I don't want them to know.
Oh, but you're entitled to spy on my life?
I can read a bloody bank statement.
I'm paying money to raise another man's kid.
I know that and now anyone listening to this phone call knows it too.
Apart from that, how was your day?
[PHONE BEEPS]
_
[COMPUTER BEEPS]
[PEN CLATTERS TO FLOOR]
On your feet, soldier.
[HE GRUNTS]
Where the hell did he get that?
- "Halo".
- Yeah.
[BIRDS TWITTER]
They're back?
Apparently so.
The chief wants to see you.
Not you, him.
Present for you on the table.
Thank you.
I told them to put some visas in it and make it look scruffy.
Never trust a new passport, in my view.
Always go with the old 'uns... like Third World taxi drivers, there's a reason they have survived.
"Andrew Birch"?
We like the tree thing, we thought we'd stick with that.
It's all official.
You are reborn.
The visas are real.
If you want to renew, go to the consulate abroad...
less risky.
[PASSPORT CLATTERS TO GROUND]
- What's up?
- Erm, I thought that was my present.
Well, it can be, if you do something for me.
[CHUCKLES] Right.
Sandy, papers.
Mm-hmm.
We're going to need a witness... preferably Spanish so they can't actually read the bloody thing.
I'll get Carlos.
- Is he 18?
- Yeah.
Wait, what is this?
What am I signing?
Jesus, Pine, for a murderer on the run, you're pretty bloody picky.
I am giving you your own company.
[CHUCKLES]
Erm...
Look, I...
Look, I really...
I don't know anything about running a company.
You don't have to.
All you have to do is sign as Andrew Birch.
Why don't you practise a few signatures?
Get the feel of it.
[HE CLEARS HIS THROAT]
Andrew Birch.
B-I-R,
C for Charlie,
H for Hotel.
Go on.
Manly one.
Go for a manly one.
- Andrew Birch in a hurry.
- [CHUCKLES]
[ROPER GROWLS] Andrew Birch.
One more.
That's more like it.
[DOOR OPENS]
Carlos, ven aqui.
- Necesito que firmes esto.

There and there and one more there.
Carlos, here, right at the bottom.
Good lad.

Welcome to the family, Andrew.

[LATIN DANCE MUSIC]
[CORKY LAUGHS]
Thank you.
What about austerity, Apo?
- This is austerity.
- [LAUGHS]
You should have seen our country five years ago.
- Tomorrow's business...
- Uh-huh?
By the way, my Arab friend is concerned you can't deliver the merchandise you promised.
I wouldn't worry about that, Apo, it'll be fine.
I hope so.
- Ah, Mr Barghati.
- Sandy.
How good to see you.
[LATIN DANCE MUSIC]
[SHE WHIMPERS]
Oh, my goodness!
Oh, Lord!
Oh, Lord!
What's happening here?
[MAID SOBS]
- [SHE WHIMPERS]
- Qué pasa?
Qué pasa?
- Qué pasa?
- [SHE SOBS]
[MAID SOBS]
[LATIN DANCE MUSIC]
- Jesus!
- Help her!
Help me, please!
[GASPING] Elena!
Elena!
Elena!
Elena!
Elena!
She must've been in so much pain.
Yeah, well, she's caused a lot of other people pain, too.
We had to reschedule that meeting.
Still, the canapes were good.
What do you want to do about our Arab chum?
Bring him out to the villa?
I don't much like that, it's too risky if someone's got a watch on him.
Invite him to the children's party.
There'll be lots of people there, you can do your magic tricks.
Try and get them right.
- Fix it up, will you?
- OK.
Sorry, darling, I don't know what I was thinking, it was a crass thing to say.
_
- [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] - [SCOFFS]
OK... let's go, dream boy.
Huh!
Come on.
Go left.
Up the stairs.
So the silly sod is insisting on 10% and he is digging his heels in.
All right, we'll let him enjoy that for a week, and then we'll take it away from him.
Yeah, that's fine.
I'm happy to go with that.
Ah, there he is.
Dans, you're on.
Thank you very much, sir, for rescuing me.
I hope you're feeling better.
[CHUCKLES]
You're very welcome.
All right, now scram.
See if you can catch us some mackerel for supper.
And take the dogs, will you?
Go on, Shirley.
Go on, you foul-smelling creature.
You'll call him, will you?
Yep.
Leave it with me, I'll deal with it.
Don't waste any energy trying to sweet-talk him,
- just lay it out, let him sweat.
- All right.
All right, Frisky, no more interruptions,
- no-one on the terrace.
- [BUZZING]
- What the hell is that noise?
- Oh, Javier is blowing leaves.
Well, tell him to knock it off, will you?
Cease and desist.
How's the face?
- It's fine.
- We'll be all right.
- So, what do you want?
- I'd like to... to go back to the restaurant, if that's all right.
That's not what I meant.
What do you want... from the world?
[LEAF BLOWER STOPS]
I don't know.
I haven't got a plan.
I'm taking some time out.
Don't believe you.
You've never relaxed in your life.
If you say so.
Just sit down.
[ROPER SIGHS]
Everyone assumes that I was born with a silver spoon in my mouth.
It's balls.
My father was an Oxfordshire auctioneer, taught me the price of everything, but the drive to create all of this, that comes from me and me alone.
Where does it come from in you?
I'm not sure I have what you describe.
OK, you patched me up, I'm very grateful for that, and now I'd like to go.
Corky can't make you out, you see.
Suspicious chap, Corks.
He's got bad vibes about you.
Why did you kill that fellow in Devon?
It's all over the wire.
We had to call the police, no choice.
They'll be here any minute.
You are a cool cucumber, aren't you?
He cheated me.
And you didn't like that?
- No, I didn't.
- Quite right.
The MacArthurs have confirmed for dinner, so... that makes 12 tonight.
Or 13.
Come and tell us why you think this one's a bad apple, Corky?
Well, his references aren't too clever.
Luckily for you, old Jorge was so desperate for a sous chef, he didn't bother to check them.
You faked them, Pine?
I needed the job.
I needed it fast, I didn't have time for formalities.
Where'd you get the passport?
I met a girl... in Devon.
Didn't we all.
Pretty little thing.
Who's Quince?
Her ex.
He'd never been abroad, he'd never had a passport, so I took his name.
You've taken a lot of names, haven't you?
It makes a man wonder who you really are.
So, father killed in Belfast, no close relationship with mother, married once for six months, we can assume not a triumph.
Two tours in Iraq, distinguished service.
And on return, what?
Despair, depression, and then five years as a night owl in the hotel business.
What was that?
Hibernation?
Burying yourself alive?
And then a sudden moment of madness.
Thieving, narcotics... murder.
[ROPER CHUCKLES SOFTLY]
This is bloody chaos, Jonathan.
Do you even know who you are?
Those two chaps you smashed up in the restaurant, did you know them?
No.
They hadn't eaten there before?
Did they look like they'd eaten there before?
- Ever sailed a boat for them?
- Is this some kind of interrogation?
Let's pretend it is.
Did you cook for them?
No.
The mussels were marvellous, by the way.
So you weren't the lookout guy?
- You didn't switch roles halfway through?
- No.
That's another one of Corky's little theories.
Listen, I haven't asked for anything, all right?
I don't expect a reward,
I certainly don't appreciate this investigation into my personal life.
And, frankly, I'm bored of your hospitality.
Maybe I'm not squeaky-clean, but nor, I suspect, are you and your little friend here, so maybe we just leave it at that.
- Little friend!
- I know!
Charmant!
- Where are you going?
- I'm leaving.
What are you going to do for a passport?
I have a passport in the name of Thomas Quince.
Where is it?
Corky, sock him the bad news.
The passport's gone, old love.
Thomas Quince had to be shredded.
- What are you talking about?
- It's no good getting in a panic, my dear.
Your cover's blown sky-high.
Tom Quince is on every wanted list on God's earth.
Murder, theft, sadly not buggery, but we'll work on that.
That was my passport.
That was mine!
Well, you're going to have to learn to be someone else, aren't you?
[DOOR OPENS]
I said no-one in here!
Sorry, baby, I didn't know.
Jesus!
Sorry, my darling, I didn't know it was you.
It's actually good news.
Thomas is going to be staying for a while,
- till he's fighting fit again.
- Oh.
That's great.
You want to come for a swim?
Go on.
Corky can lend you some Speedos.
- I'd like to.
- [SHE LAUGHS]
Corky, why don't you put him in the fisherman's cottage at the end of the estate...
- while we work out what to do with you.
- All right, boss.
And what am I supposed to do until then?
Well, you can keep Dans company.
We were supposed to have a school friend here for the holiday, but the bugger stood him up.
His mother doesn't approve of me.
One more thing...
I run a tight ship here.
You're right, we do a little swashbuckling every now and then, but we play straight with each other.
Now, you saved my boy and I'm grateful, but if you step out of line... we'll make you howl for your mother.
What size feet have you got?
- 12.
- Hmm.
Now, house rules.
No phones, no postcards to Devon dumplings.
No messages in a bottle.
The chief values privacy... as do we all.
All the way down to the beach, as far as you can go, and it's on the right.
Alternatively, fill your pockets with stones, walk into the sea... and keep going.
Anything?
- No.
- [SHE SIGHS]
Bloody hell!
I hate this bit.
_
Off every tree you may freely eat... maids, serving wenches, cooks, typists, masseuses, even the lady who comes to clip the canary's claws.
But if you lay one hand on that precious fruit, then like the Belgians in the Congo, we'll chop it off.
And I don't mean the hand.
Senor Roper.
Morning.
I was wondering if I might take Danny into town?
What for?
A change.
- He likes you, doesn't he?
- I hope so.
I like him.
Frisky and Tabby will go with you.
Pine thank you.
It's me.
They're on the move.
[BIRDSONG]
Do you always have this much company, Danny?
Since the restaurant.
- It's a bit boring, isn't it?
- Yeah.
Oi!
[DANNY GASPS]
It's OK.
It's all right.
[DANNY LAUGHS]
- Danny?
- Yeah.
What do you say... to an ice cream?
- Yeah?
Great.
- Yeah.
Actually...
[JONATHAN GRUNTS] ...why don't you ask Frisky and Tabby if they want an ice cream as well, huh?
OK.
- Would you like an ice cream?
- No.
- Really?
Would you?
- No.
They didn't want one.
- They don't want one?
- No.
They are very strange, aren't they, those two?
Yeah, especially on a day like this,
- who wouldn't want an ice cream?
!
- [LAUGHS]
What's your favourite flavour, Danny?
- Pistachio.
- Dos pistachios, por favor.
Para mi.
- Danny?
- Yeah?
Do you know who's... coming to the party on Sunday?
It's a select group, around 25.
Senior, por favor...
Sorry, I need to hear the complete list, all the names of all your ice creams.
Oh, gracias.
Sorry.
That's all right.
I think Sandy and Caroline will probably be there, won't they?
I don't know who's coming.
You see, I've got this problem, it's Major Corcoran.
I don't think he likes me very much.
- Why not?
- I don't know.
But he's trying to find out everything he can about me.
All the way back to the time of the ancient Egyptians.
[THEY LAUGH]
Mmm.
Muchos gracias.
Right, waiting's over.
- We've got a spot of work to do,
- All right, come on.
thank God.
- So, how often do you come here?
- Only in the summer.
It must be nice to see Dad, though?
Do you play tennis with him?
I have lessons with Lewis.
- Roper's not here much.
- Well, I expect he works hard, eh?
- That's why he has such a big house.
- I bet you've counted the rooms.
23.
There's three kitchens and a big office by the pool.
And there's Roper's secret study in his bedroom, but no-one's allowed in there.
- Except you?
Special guest?
- I'm not.
He calls it The Citadel.
And there's one key... and he hides it.
Do you know what's inside?
He says it's full of peppermints.
Well, I'd lock it up too if I were him.
[THEY LAUGH]
Plus, there's an alarm.
They test it every day at 11.
You have to be really careful.
Why?
This is where I cut my foot last year.
Roper made me stand in the sea for about half an hour, because of the salt.
[CHURCH BELL CHIMES]
_
Ever since his daughter killed herself, he comes here every day.
And that's not all.
Yesterday afternoon, he calls the hotline of the Madrid Public Prosecutor's Office, says he has information regarding a world-class illegal arms deal.
Operator asks his name, he hangs up.
Assumption, a priest's advice only goes so far.
[PRIEST SPEAKS SPANISH]
- Gracias, padre.
- Gracias.
Mr Apostol?
Who are you?
I'm your guardian angel, Mr Apostol.
I can't sleep.
Every night...
I ask myself the same question.
What I could have done?
[HE SOBS]
[SNIFFLES]
Now you're having a child you can understand how I feel.
I can, Juan.
When you called the Madrid office, you had blood on your hands.
And I'm here to wash it off.
How?
- You know Richard Roper?
- Yes.
- He's a friend.
- Juan, he's not a friend.
He dragged you down and he dragged your daughter down too.
If Roper wasn't in your life, I think she'd still be alive today.
Sorry.
Now, God knows how you bear it, I...
I don't think I could.
Listen, I'm on the side of the angels.
We're good people, we play it straight and we keep our promises.
OK?
But I need your help.
Do you know Lance Corcoran?
Yes.
He's Dicky Roper's right-hand man.
Right, well, that's what needs to change.
Are you pink?
Socialist, left-wing, march of history, that sort of thing?
It wouldn't bother me if you were, it's another one of Corky's bugbears.
He seems to have a few.
Yeah.
Been in a lot of foxholes, me and Corky.
Once spent a week together in a police cell in Delhi.
I don't think I've ever laughed so much in my whole life.
Was he drinking then?
Well, now, that is a deeply odd thing to say.
What business is it of yours how much he drinks?
When my father was serving in Belfast a sergeant in his platoon got drunk one night, told a local girl what the next day's operation was.
The man I loved most in the world was dead for five pints of lager and the promise of a quickie.
Right, so you don't drink and you're not pink, what are you?
Me, I'm a free man.
Free to think, free to work, free to climb a mountain or lie in bed all day eating peppermint creams without any bugger telling me how.
Then I'm a free man.
Oh, that's the free part, the man part's a little different.
See, children grow up thinking the adult world is ordered, rational, fit for purpose.
It's crap.
Becoming a man is realising... that it's all rotten.
Realising how to celebrate that rottenness, that's freedom.
SANDY:
Here we are.
WOMAN:
Out we go.
[SANDY GROANS]
Come on.
Chop chop.
Let's go.
Mademoiselle.
[SHE GIGGLES]
- Merci, monsieur.
- OK.
Senor?
The bags, please.
Thank you so much.
[DOOR CLOSES]
Thank you so much for coming.
Have a wonderful day.
Caro, divine as ever.
- Sandy, sort of acceptable.
- There you go.
Apo, my dear old friend.
- I'm so terribly sorry for your loss.
- Thanks.
How are you?
I can't even imagine.
Mr Barghati, thank you so much for coming.
Please come inside.
Let's see if we can feed and sustain you before we get down to business.
And did you get the sweater?
Great.
Does it fit?
Mmm.
Uh-huh.
OK.
Love you.
Bye, honey.
[SHE SOBS]
- [KNOCK AT DOOR] - [SHE GASPS]
I'm so sorry to interrupt.
The guests are arriving and the party's going to start soon.
The story begins in Egypt 4,500 years ago.
The ancient Egyptians invented this game.
It is literally the oldest trick in the book.
Now, you start with a ball.
We have one, two, three cups.
You lay one cup like that, one cup like that, one cup like that...
All right?
Now, I'm going to take the ball and I'm going to place the ball in the cup.
Shake the cup.
Turn it over.
All right, now, you have to watch very closely.
You have to watch the cups.
I'm going to move these two round like that.
This one round like that.
Everybody clear on where the ball is now?
Danny, where's the ball?
You think the ball's here?
- No, Danny, the ball's in the middle!
- [LAUGHTER]
You're not watching the cups, Danny.
Thomas is watching the cups, aren't you, Thomas?
You're a gym bunny, aren't you?
Aren't you?
A little cold gym bunny...
He can't stop his mouth... in every way.
Corky can get a little overexcited when he's drunk.
Yes, that is what Mr Barghati is worried about.
That little smile...
According to our friend, he has been shooting his mouth off... talking about things he should not.
Barghati doesn't want him involved... condition of the deal.
- Thanks for that, Apo.
- CORKY:
Spit.
Yeah!
[LAUGHS]
Come...
Come with me...
And it's a funny thing, isn't it?
If you want to piss...
I am so sorry to interrupt, but can I just borrow the old man for a second?
- Oh, of course.
- Thank you.
- Excuse me.
- Bye.
Bye.
I have just spoken to Apo, and he has a...
There you go, Danny.
Thomas.
ROPER:
For God's sake...
Roper,
Thomas and I are going to go for a little stroll.
All right, darling.
Frisky, Major Corkoran is here with some friends of Dorothy that I would like to have escorted from the premises.
You and Tabby can make as much noise as you like.
All right?
- A pleasure.
- Tabbs.
CORKY:
If you need to relieve yourself, it's good to do it into a suitable perspective.
It's better than a urinal, isn't it?
- God's urinal, I call this.
- You've got to break it up.
You're giving the boss indigestion with your buddies here.
- Come on, lads.
The party's over.
- Frisky, go pee-pee.
Leave your drinks here.
Frisky, don't be too rough.
[WATER SPLASHES]
Who are all these people?
How should I know?
You're not curious?
Why should I be?
- It's business.
- Which is what?
Buying and selling agricultural equipment.
Caro says Sandy tells her everything.
That would drive me insane.
You shouldn't have seen me like that today, in my bedroom.
I'm sorry.
The door was open.
I thought you were dressed.
That's not what I meant.
I don't care who sees me naked.
I do care who sees me crying.
You tell no-one you saw that, is that clear?
Of course.
I'm going swimming.
- Want to come?
- Ah...
I don't think that would be wise.
There's no current.
[DRESS UNZIPS]
That's not quite what I meant.
I know it wasn't.
[HE SIGHS]
There she goes, beyond the ha-ha!
One day, Thomas, you'll live a little.

- [TRAFFIC RUMBLES] - [SIRENS WAIL]
_
- [KNOCK AT DOOR]
- Erm, come...
Rex, do you have a minute?
The Permanent Secretary would love to see you.
Erm, yes.
- Is that a yes or a no?
- Mm-hmm.
- [DOOR OPENS]
- Rex, come in.
- You know Geoffrey Dromgoole, of course,
- Geoffrey.
- and his team from the River.
- Rex.
Barbara Vandon from the American Embassy.
Rex Mayhew, my undersecretary.
- Good to see you, Rex.
- Barbara, how are you?
Rex, it's this Limpet thing.
Limpet?
The Joel Steadman enforcement operation with Angela Burr on side-saddle.
Yes, I know what Limpet is...
it's an enforcement case.
It's nothing to do with Langley... or River House.
Well, it's what Barbara feels we ought to be discussing.
Rex, Langley has been completely railroaded on this.
Currently, we have a joint operation on foreign soil between two extremely fringe outfits.
They're chasing international arms in an area of the world that is... way beyond their comprehension.
It's crazy.
I have to say, I agree.
You know, Limpet is operating in a highly incendiary region, and I would hate to see that run out of control.
In my view, it should be placed under a purely intelligence jurisdiction, acting on a political brief,
- but, it's not my decision.
- [SIRENS WAIL]
No, it's not.
I'm sure I don't need to remind you or your team that my recommendation, accepted by the Permanent Secretary, was that River House was overextended, and that enforcement agencies were urgently needed to prosecute any areas of international criminal activity that were,
for whatever reason, slipping through the intelligence net.
In that context, I find the actions of River House somewhat inimical to the new era of parliamentary accountability and transparency.
Does that answer your question?
- Why don't we leave it there for today?
- Thank you.
[DOOR OPENS AND SLAMS]
Have you got a moment?
Not much more than that...
Celia's cooking rabbit.
- That's all it will take.
- [HE SNIFFS]
Good job in there.
You pressed all the right buttons...
accountability, transparency...
I don't like being bullied, never have.
You see, the thing is, I'm not sure that Limpet's quite the abject failure that Angela Burr would have us believe.
Really?
So, the day that the Limpet case is ours, you get an uncle in Switzerland who has suffered an untimely death... a rich uncle.
I'm going to pretend I didn't hear that.
You're in over your head, Rex.
- It's...
- Don't answer now... but think about it.
Enjoy the rabbit.
- Morning.
- Hi.
- Are you not swimming?
- I'm not in the mood.
I like you, Thomas...
You see everything and say nothing.
[SHE SOBS]
My husband is screwing our nanny.
[SNIFFLES]
What a cliché.
Jed said I should have hired an uglier girl but the agency only had stunners. [SHE SNIFFLES]
Could you do my back?
Don't worry, I don't want to sleep with you.
- Why is he keeping you here?
- I don't know.
Grooming you, is he?
For what?
You just be careful.
Roper's planning a big arms deal to Apo's Lebanese friend.
Weapons from seven British and American companies... weapons no-one should be trading in.
Roper's using a company called TradePass to fence the deal.
He pretends it trades in agricultural equipment and his investors pretend to believe him.
You can stop rubbing now.
Why are you telling me this?
I just want to be honest with someone in this world.
Does Jed know?
No, of course not!
Sandy screws everyone and tells me everything.
Roper is steadfastly faithful and tells Jed nothing.
Do you think I should tell her?
Maybe.
[HE GRUNTS]
If it's worry for your boy, forget it.
He knew what he was getting into.
Did he?
So, you and Mr Burr, are you making a go of it?
Well, you know, like my mum says, "You make your bed... you die in it."
[HE CHUCKLES]
No, Gordon's a decent man.
It's not his fault I'm not in love with him.
Listen...
Oh, Joel, let's not have that conversation, please?
Well, you can't deny the past.
- Past is all it is.
- It doesn't have to be.
[SHE SIGHS]
Joel...
You silly sod.

[BIRDS TWITTER]
Hi, Corky.
Frisky.
Hey, Danny.
Thomas, have you seen my phone?
I haven't.
Sorry.
Dad'll be cross.
Everyone's cross and Jed's not talking to Dad.
What's going on?
I don't know.
I'll tell you what, why don't I come downstairs and read you a bedtime story, and we can look for your phone in the morning?
OK.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
What should we read?
I don't know.
Which one's your favourite?
Three Little Pigs.
OK, the pigs?
I can give you the Thomas version...
Two Little Pigs.
No.
[HE EXHALES]
- [COMPUTER BEEPS]
- What's that?
That right there.
Punch that up.
Punch that up.
What is it?
[COMPUTER BEEPS]
It's your boy.
"Seven tractor firms"...
seven armament manufacturers?
"Home sale with best friend", that's the UK and the US.
"Buyer in Beirut via Worst Man".
Well, Worst Man is Roper.
Roper's the middleman?
- What's TradePass?
- I'm not sure, must be a front organisation.
What I do know, though, is Roper's pressed the green light.
All right.
OK.
Hey, guys...
OK, so, just put the cases by the taxi and then you can jump in.
Good girl.
Pop in.
Jump in.
OK, put your seatbelts on, guys.
[CARO CRIES SOFTLY]
OK...
- OK.
Here we go.
- [ENGINE RUMBLES]
[WOMAN SOBS]
Get in the taxi, you bloody whore!
- Caroline, for...
- You bitch!
Caroline, for Christ's sake, she's going.
She's going.
She's go...
- Caro...
- Bitch!
- Whore!
- Caroline.
- Just shut up!
- All right.
Just shut up, Sandy, you shit!
What, you like the show?
You like the show, Dicky?
Dicky Roper?
[CAR ENGINE REVS]
See you later, guys.
Jed, darling...
Don't even.
Where is everybody?
- Monaco.
- Huh.
Two days of meetings.
Things are ramping up.
And you're not...
- You're not going too?
- Not me, no.
The girl was supposed to go but she's blown him out.
I'm staying with her.
We're going riding instead.
Didn't she invite you?
- Oh, dear.
- [PINE CHUCKLES]
Very good.
Well, have a nice time.
- [CLOCK TICKS] - [INSECT BUZZES]
[HE BREATHES HEAVILY]
[ALARM BLARES]
[ALARM CONTINUES]
- [ALARM STOPS] - [HE EXHALES]
JED:
I'll just be a minute.
What are you doing in here?
I brought you some flowers.
Why didn't you give them to the maids?
- I have to change.
- Close the door.
You can't be in here.
This is our bedroom.
What is that?
I found it on the desktop.
You broke into his office and you spied on his papers.
You have to be more careful.
CORKY:
Darling, Angel, Sweetie, everyone's starving...
- He can't see you.
- Get rid of him.
Are you decent?
- What's going on?
- Nothing.
I'm coming.
_
How was your trip?
Noisy.
I hitched a ride on a C-130.
- Oh, fun.
- How was yours?
Fine, thank you.
I'm not sure why we had to make it.
Is there a reason we're doing this in person?
Well, Halo is not too keen on intermediaries just now.
And yet he's sent you?
There's an enforcement operation called Limpet.
We have to keep our eyes on it.
Halo says you need to be careful.
I am always careful.
How far have they got?
They've drawn a line between Langbourne and Apostol.
- Jesus.
- How did they manage that?
A photograph of a meeting.
Are they after buyers or sellers?
We don't know.
We assume both.
You can assure Halo that we have taken every precaution.
We have received intelligence of our own.
We are changing the guard.
Good.
JED:
How was your meeting?
It was fine.
It was fine?
Don't be so bloody childish!
Look, Caro was upset.
She wanted to get back at Sandy so she started spreading manure.
That's it.
End of story.
That's what it is... it's just a story?
Jesus, Jed, what the hell is the matter with you?
Tell me why I should believe you.
Why shouldn't you believe me?
- When have I ever lied to you?
- Oh, you... you don't lie to me.
You're much too clever for that.
You just hide.
- What?
What do I hide?
- The truth, Roper!
Well, what about your truth?
What about the things you hide from me?
I don't hide anything from you.
You have a child, Jed!
You have a son.
Let's start with him.
Or don't you think he counts?
How do you know that?
We're not talking how, we're talking why.
Why would you hide that from me?
That was not included in the brochure.
Screw your brochure, Roper.
You don't own me.
No-one is entitled to know things about me that I don't want them to know.
Oh, but you're entitled to spy on my life?
I can read a bloody bank statement.
I'm paying money to raise another man's kid.
I know that and now anyone listening to this phone call knows it too.
Apart from that, how was your day?
[PHONE BEEPS]
_
[COMPUTER BEEPS]
[PEN CLATTERS TO FLOOR]
On your feet, soldier.
[HE GRUNTS]
Where the hell did he get that?
- "Halo".
- Yeah.
[BIRDS TWITTER]
They're back?
Apparently so.
The chief wants to see you.
Not you, him.
Present for you on the table.
Thank you.
I told them to put some visas in it and make it look scruffy.
Never trust a new passport, in my view.
Always go with the old 'uns... like Third World taxi drivers, there's a reason they have survived.
"Andrew Birch"?
We like the tree thing, we thought we'd stick with that.
It's all official.
You are reborn.
The visas are real.
If you want to renew, go to the consulate abroad...
less risky.
[PASSPORT CLATTERS TO GROUND]
- What's up?
- Erm, I thought that was my present.
Well, it can be, if you do something for me.
[CHUCKLES] Right.
Sandy, papers.
Mm-hmm.
We're going to need a witness... preferably Spanish so they can't actually read the bloody thing.
I'll get Carlos.
- Is he 18?
- Yeah.
Wait, what is this?
What am I signing?
Jesus, Pine, for a murderer on the run, you're pretty bloody picky.
I am giving you your own company.
[CHUCKLES]
Erm...
Look, I...
Look, I really...
I don't know anything about running a company.
You don't have to.
All you have to do is sign as Andrew Birch.
Why don't you practise a few signatures?
Get the feel of it.
[HE CLEARS HIS THROAT]
Andrew Birch.
B-I-R,
C for Charlie,
H for Hotel.
Go on.
Manly one.
Go for a manly one.
- Andrew Birch in a hurry.
- [CHUCKLES]
[ROPER GROWLS] Andrew Birch.
One more.
That's more like it.
[DOOR OPENS]
Carlos, ven aqui.
- Necesito que firmes esto.
- _

There and there and one more there.
Carlos, here, right at the bottom.
Good lad.
[DOOR OPENS]
[DOOR CLOSES]
Welcome to the family, Andrew.
- ALL: ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ - _
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

My darling daughter!
The most beautiful girl in the world!

Ooh!
The most expensive necklace!

Enjoy the party!
[CHEERING]
[LATIN DANCE MUSIC]
[CORKY LAUGHS]
Thank you.
What about austerity, Apo?
- This is austerity.
- [LAUGHS]
You should have seen our country five years ago.
- Tomorrow's business...
- Uh-huh?
By the way, my Arab friend is concerned you can't deliver the merchandise you promised.
I wouldn't worry about that, Apo, it'll be fine.
I hope so.
- Ah, Mr Barghati.
- Sandy.
How good to see you.
[LATIN DANCE MUSIC]
[SHE WHIMPERS]
Oh, my goodness!
Oh, Lord!
Oh, Lord!
What's happening here?
[MAID SOBS]
- [SHE WHIMPERS]
- Qué pasa?
Qué pasa?
- Qué pasa?
- [SHE SOBS]
[MAID SOBS]
[LATIN DANCE MUSIC]
- Jesus!
- Help her!
Help me, please!
[GASPING] Elena!
Elena!
Elena!
Elena!
Elena!
She must've been in so much pain.
Yeah, well, she's caused a lot of other people pain, too.
We had to reschedule that meeting.
Still, the canapes were good.
What do you want to do about our Arab chum?
Bring him out to the villa?
I don't much like that, it's too risky if someone's got a watch on him.
Invite him to the children's party.
There'll be lots of people there, you can do your magic tricks.
Try and get them right.
- Fix it up, will you?
- OK.
Sorry, darling, I don't know what I was thinking, it was a crass thing to say.
_
- [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] - [SCOFFS]
OK... let's go, dream boy.
Huh!
Come on.
Go left.
Up the stairs.
So the silly sod is insisting on 10% and he is digging his heels in.
All right, we'll let him enjoy that for a week, and then we'll take it away from him.
Yeah, that's fine.
I'm happy to go with that.
Ah, there he is.
Dans, you're on.
Thank you very much, sir, for rescuing me.
I hope you're feeling better.
[CHUCKLES]
You're very welcome.
All right, now scram.
See if you can catch us some mackerel for supper.
And take the dogs, will you?
Go on, Shirley.
Go on, you foul-smelling creature.
You'll call him, will you?
Yep.
Leave it with me, I'll deal with it.
Don't waste any energy trying to sweet-talk him,
- just lay it out, let him sweat.
- All right.
All right, Frisky, no more interruptions,
- no-one on the terrace.
- [BUZZING]
- What the hell is that noise?
- Oh, Javier is blowing leaves.
Well, tell him to knock it off, will you?
Cease and desist.
How's the face?
- It's fine.
- We'll be all right.
- So, what do you want?
- I'd like to... to go back to the restaurant, if that's all right.
That's not what I meant.
What do you want... from the world?
[LEAF BLOWER STOPS]
I don't know.
I haven't got a plan.
I'm taking some time out.
Don't believe you.
You've never relaxed in your life.
If you say so.
Just sit down.
[ROPER SIGHS]
Everyone assumes that I was born with a silver spoon in my mouth.
It's balls.
My father was an Oxfordshire auctioneer, taught me the price of everything, but the drive to create all of this, that comes from me and me alone.
Where does it come from in you?
I'm not sure I have what you describe.
OK, you patched me up, I'm very grateful for that, and now I'd like to go.
Corky can't make you out, you see.
Suspicious chap, Corks.
He's got bad vibes about you.
Why did you kill that fellow in Devon?
It's all over the wire.
We had to call the police, no choice.
They'll be here any minute.
You are a cool cucumber, aren't you?
He cheated me.
And you didn't like that?
- No, I didn't.
- Quite right.
The MacArthurs have confirmed for dinner, so... that makes 12 tonight.
Or 13.
Come and tell us why you think this one's a bad apple, Corky?
Well, his references aren't too clever.
Luckily for you, old Jorge was so desperate for a sous chef, he didn't bother to check them.
You faked them, Pine?
I needed the job.
I needed it fast, I didn't have time for formalities.
Where'd you get the passport?
I met a girl... in Devon.
Didn't we all.
Pretty little thing.
Who's Quince?
Her ex.
He'd never been abroad, he'd never had a passport, so I took his name.
You've taken a lot of names, haven't you?
It makes a man wonder who you really are.
So, father killed in Belfast, no close relationship with mother, married once for six months, we can assume not a triumph.
Two tours in Iraq, distinguished service.
And on return, what?
Despair, depression, and then five years as a night owl in the hotel business.
What was that?
Hibernation?
Burying yourself alive?
And then a sudden moment of madness.
Thieving, narcotics... murder.
[ROPER CHUCKLES SOFTLY]
This is bloody chaos, Jonathan.
Do you even know who you are?
Those two chaps you smashed up in the restaurant, did you know them?
No.
They hadn't eaten there before?
Did they look like they'd eaten there before?
- Ever sailed a boat for them?
- Is this some kind of interrogation?
Let's pretend it is.
Did you cook for them?
No.
The mussels were marvellous, by the way.
So you weren't the lookout guy?
- You didn't switch roles halfway through?
- No.
That's another one of Corky's little theories.
Listen, I haven't asked for anything, all right?
I don't expect a reward,
I certainly don't appreciate this investigation into my personal life.
And, frankly, I'm bored of your hospitality.
Maybe I'm not squeaky-clean, but nor, I suspect, are you and your little friend here, so maybe we just leave it at that.
- Little friend!
- I know!
Charmant!
- Where are you going?
- I'm leaving.
What are you going to do for a passport?
I have a passport in the name of Thomas Quince.
Where is it?
Corky, sock him the bad news.
The passport's gone, old love.
Thomas Quince had to be shredded.
- What are you talking about?
- It's no good getting in a panic, my dear.
Your cover's blown sky-high.
Tom Quince is on every wanted list on God's earth.
Murder, theft, sadly not buggery, but we'll work on that.
That was my passport.
That was mine!
Well, you're going to have to learn to be someone else, aren't you?
[DOOR OPENS]
I said no-one in here!
Sorry, baby, I didn't know.
Jesus!
Sorry, my darling, I didn't know it was you.
It's actually good news.
Thomas is going to be staying for a while,
- till he's fighting fit again.
- Oh.
That's great.
You want to come for a swim?
Go on.
Corky can lend you some Speedos.
- I'd like to.
- [SHE LAUGHS]
Corky, why don't you put him in the fisherman's cottage at the end of the estate...
- while we work out what to do with you.
- All right, boss.
And what am I supposed to do until then?
Well, you can keep Dans company.
We were supposed to have a school friend here for the holiday, but the bugger stood him up.
His mother doesn't approve of me.
One more thing...
I run a tight ship here.
You're right, we do a little swashbuckling every now and then, but we play straight with each other.
Now, you saved my boy and I'm grateful, but if you step out of line... we'll make you howl for your mother.
What size feet have you got?
- 12.
- Hmm.
Now, house rules.
No phones, no postcards to Devon dumplings.
No messages in a bottle.
The chief values privacy... as do we all.
All the way down to the beach, as far as you can go, and it's on the right.
Alternatively, fill your pockets with stones, walk into the sea... and keep going.
Anything?
- No.
- [SHE SIGHS]
Bloody hell!
I hate this bit.
_
Off every tree you may freely eat... maids, serving wenches, cooks, typists, masseuses, even the lady who comes to clip the canary's claws.
But if you lay one hand on that precious fruit, then like the Belgians in the Congo, we'll chop it off.
And I don't mean the hand.
Senor Roper.
Morning.
I was wondering if I might take Danny into town?
What for?
A change.
- He likes you, doesn't he?
- I hope so.
I like him.
Frisky and Tabby will go with you.
Pine thank you.
It's me.
They're on the move.
[BIRDSONG]
Do you always have this much company, Danny?
Since the restaurant.
- It's a bit boring, isn't it?
- Yeah.
Oi!
[DANNY GASPS]
It's OK.
It's all right.
[DANNY LAUGHS]
- Danny?
- Yeah.
What do you say... to an ice cream?
- Yeah?
Great.
- Yeah.
Actually...
[JONATHAN GRUNTS] ...why don't you ask Frisky and Tabby if they want an ice cream as well, huh?
OK.
- Would you like an ice cream?
- No.
- Really?
Would you?
- No.
They didn't want one.
- They don't want one?
- No.
They are very strange, aren't they, those two?
Yeah, especially on a day like this,
- who wouldn't want an ice cream?
!
- [LAUGHS]
What's your favourite flavour, Danny?
- Pistachio.
- Dos pistachios, por favor.
Para mi.
- Danny?
- Yeah?
Do you know who's... coming to the party on Sunday?
It's a select group, around 25.
Senior, por favor...
Sorry, I need to hear the complete list, all the names of all your ice creams.
Oh, gracias.
Sorry.
That's all right.
I think Sandy and Caroline will probably be there, won't they?
I don't know who's coming.
You see, I've got this problem, it's Major Corcoran.
I don't think he likes me very much.
- Why not?
- I don't know.
But he's trying to find out everything he can about me.
All the way back to the time of the ancient Egyptians.
[THEY LAUGH]
Mmm.
Muchos gracias.
Right, waiting's over.
- We've got a spot of work to do,
- All right, come on.
thank God.
- So, how often do you come here?
- Only in the summer.
It must be nice to see Dad, though?
Do you play tennis with him?
I have lessons with Lewis.
- Roper's not here much.
- Well, I expect he works hard, eh?
- That's why he has such a big house.
- I bet you've counted the rooms.
23.
There's three kitchens and a big office by the pool.
And there's Roper's secret study in his bedroom, but no-one's allowed in there.
- Except you?
Special guest?
- I'm not.
He calls it The Citadel.
And there's one key... and he hides it.
Do you know what's inside?
He says it's full of peppermints.
Well, I'd lock it up too if I were him.
[THEY LAUGH]
Plus, there's an alarm.
They test it every day at 11.
You have to be really careful.
Why?
This is where I cut my foot last year.
Roper made me stand in the sea for about half an hour, because of the salt.
[CHURCH BELL CHIMES]
_
Ever since his daughter killed herself, he comes here every day.
And that's not all.
Yesterday afternoon, he calls the hotline of the Madrid Public Prosecutor's Office, says he has information regarding a world-class illegal arms deal.
Operator asks his name, he hangs up.
Assumption, a priest's advice only goes so far.
[PRIEST SPEAKS SPANISH]
- Gracias, padre.
- Gracias.
Mr Apostol?
Who are you?
I'm your guardian angel, Mr Apostol.
I can't sleep.
Every night...
I ask myself the same question.
What I could have done?
[HE SOBS]
[SNIFFLES]
Now you're having a child you can understand how I feel.
I can, Juan.
When you called the Madrid office, you had blood on your hands.
And I'm here to wash it off.
How?
- You know Richard Roper?
- Yes.
- He's a friend.
- Juan, he's not a friend.
He dragged you down and he dragged your daughter down too.
If Roper wasn't in your life, I think she'd still be alive today.
Sorry.
Now, God knows how you bear it, I...
I don't think I could.
Listen, I'm on the side of the angels.
We're good people, we play it straight and we keep our promises.
OK?
But I need your help.
Do you know Lance Corcoran?
Yes.
He's Dicky Roper's right-hand man.
Right, well, that's what needs to change.
Are you pink?
Socialist, left-wing, march of history, that sort of thing?
It wouldn't bother me if you were, it's another one of Corky's bugbears.
He seems to have a few.
Yeah.
Been in a lot of foxholes, me and Corky.
Once spent a week together in a police cell in Delhi.
I don't think I've ever laughed so much in my whole life.
Was he drinking then?
Well, now, that is a deeply odd thing to say.
What business is it of yours how much he drinks?
When my father was serving in Belfast a sergeant in his platoon got drunk one night, told a local girl what the next day's operation was.
The man I loved most in the world was dead for five pints of lager and the promise of a quickie.
Right, so you don't drink and you're not pink, what are you?
Me, I'm a free man.
Free to think, free to work, free to climb a mountain or lie in bed all day eating peppermint creams without any bugger telling me how.
Then I'm a free man.
Oh, that's the free part, the man part's a little different.
See, children grow up thinking the adult world is ordered, rational, fit for purpose.
It's crap.
Becoming a man is realising... that it's all rotten.
Realising how to celebrate that rottenness, that's freedom.
SANDY:
Here we are.
WOMAN:
Out we go.
[SANDY GROANS]
Come on.
Chop chop.
Let's go.
Mademoiselle.
[SHE GIGGLES]
- Merci, monsieur.
- OK.
Senor?
The bags, please.
Thank you so much.
[DOOR CLOSES]
Thank you so much for coming.
Have a wonderful day.
Caro, divine as ever.
- Sandy, sort of acceptable.
- There you go.
Apo, my dear old friend.
- I'm so terribly sorry for your loss.
- Thanks.
How are you?
I can't even imagine.
Mr Barghati, thank you so much for coming.
Please come inside.
Let's see if we can feed and sustain you before we get down to business.
And did you get the sweater?
Great.
Does it fit?
Mmm.
Uh-huh.
OK.
Love you.
Bye, honey.
[SHE SOBS]
- [KNOCK AT DOOR] - [SHE GASPS]
I'm so sorry to interrupt.
The guests are arriving and the party's going to start soon.
The story begins in Egypt 4,500 years ago.
The ancient Egyptians invented this game.
It is literally the oldest trick in the book.
Now, you start with a ball.
We have one, two, three cups.
You lay one cup like that, one cup like that, one cup like that...
All right?
Now, I'm going to take the ball and I'm going to place the ball in the cup.
Shake the cup.
Turn it over.
All right, now, you have to watch very closely.
You have to watch the cups.
I'm going to move these two round like that.
This one round like that.
Everybody clear on where the ball is now?
Danny, where's the ball?
You think the ball's here?
- No, Danny, the ball's in the middle!
- [LAUGHTER]
You're not watching the cups, Danny.
Thomas is watching the cups, aren't you, Thomas?
You're a gym bunny, aren't you?
Aren't you?
A little cold gym bunny...
He can't stop his mouth... in every way.
Corky can get a little overexcited when he's drunk.
Yes, that is what Mr Barghati is worried about.
That little smile...
According to our friend, he has been shooting his mouth off... talking about things he should not.
Barghati doesn't want him involved... condition of the deal.
- Thanks for that, Apo.
- CORKY:
Spit.
Yeah!
[LAUGHS]
Come...
Come with me...
And it's a funny thing, isn't it?
If you want to piss...
I am so sorry to interrupt, but can I just borrow the old man for a second?
- Oh, of course.
- Thank you.
- Excuse me.
- Bye.
Bye.
I have just spoken to Apo, and he has a...
There you go, Danny.
Thomas.
ROPER:
For God's sake...
Roper,
Thomas and I are going to go for a little stroll.
All right, darling.
Frisky, Major Corkoran is here with some friends of Dorothy that I would like to have escorted from the premises.
You and Tabby can make as much noise as you like.
All right?
- A pleasure.
- Tabbs.
CORKY:
If you need to relieve yourself, it's good to do it into a suitable perspective.
It's better than a urinal, isn't it?
- God's urinal, I call this.
- You've got to break it up.
You're giving the boss indigestion with your buddies here.
- Come on, lads.
The party's over.
- Frisky, go pee-pee.
Leave your drinks here.
Frisky, don't be too rough.
[WATER SPLASHES]
Who are all these people?
How should I know?
You're not curious?
Why should I be?
- It's business.
- Which is what?
Buying and selling agricultural equipment.
Caro says Sandy tells her everything.
That would drive me insane.
You shouldn't have seen me like that today, in my bedroom.
I'm sorry.
The door was open.
I thought you were dressed.
That's not what I meant.
I don't care who sees me naked.
I do care who sees me crying.
You tell no-one you saw that, is that clear?
Of course.
I'm going swimming.
- Want to come?
- Ah...
I don't think that would be wise.
There's no current.
[DRESS UNZIPS]
That's not quite what I meant.
I know it wasn't.
[HE SIGHS]
There she goes, beyond the ha-ha!
One day, Thomas, you'll live a little.

- Erm, come...
Rex, do you have a minute?
The Permanent Secretary would love to see you.
Erm, yes.
- Is that a yes or a no?
- Mm-hmm.
- [DOOR OPENS]
- Rex, come in.
- You know Geoffrey Dromgoole, of course,
- Geoffrey.
- and his team from the River.
- Rex.
Barbara Vandon from the American Embassy.
Rex Mayhew, my undersecretary.
- Good to see you, Rex.
- Barbara, how are you?
Rex, it's this Limpet thing.
Limpet?
The Joel Steadman enforcement operation with Angela Burr on side-saddle.
Yes, I know what Limpet is...
it's an enforcement case.
It's nothing to do with Langley... or River House.
Well, it's what Barbara feels we ought to be discussing.
Rex, Langley has been completely railroaded on this.
Currently, we have a joint operation on foreign soil between two extremely fringe outfits.
They're chasing international arms in an area of the world that is... way beyond their comprehension.
It's crazy.
I have to say, I agree.
You know, Limpet is operating in a highly incendiary region, and I would hate to see that run out of control.
In my view, it should be placed under a purely intelligence jurisdiction, acting on a political brief,
- but, it's not my decision.
- [SIRENS WAIL]
No, it's not.
I'm sure I don't need to remind you or your team that my recommendation, accepted by the Permanent Secretary, was that River House was overextended, and that enforcement agencies were urgently needed to prosecute any areas of international criminal activity that were,
for whatever reason, slipping through the intelligence net.
In that context, I find the actions of River House somewhat inimical to the new era of parliamentary accountability and transparency.
Does that answer your question?
- Why don't we leave it there for today?
- Thank you.
[DOOR OPENS AND SLAMS]
Have you got a moment?
Not much more than that...
Celia's cooking rabbit.
- That's all it will take.
- [HE SNIFFS]
Good job in there.
You pressed all the right buttons...
accountability, transparency...
I don't like being bullied, never have.
You see, the thing is, I'm not sure that Limpet's quite the abject failure that Angela Burr would have us believe.
Really?
So, the day that the Limpet case is ours, you get an uncle in Switzerland who has suffered an untimely death... a rich uncle.
I'm going to pretend I didn't hear that.
You're in over your head, Rex.
- It's...
- Don't answer now... but think about it.
Enjoy the rabbit.
- Morning.
- Hi.
- Are you not swimming?
- I'm not in the mood.
I like you, Thomas...
You see everything and say nothing.
[SHE SOBS]
My husband is screwing our nanny.
[SNIFFLES]
What a cliché.
Jed said I should have hired an uglier girl but the agency only had stunners. [SHE SNIFFLES]
Could you do my back?
Don't worry, I don't want to sleep with you.
- Why is he keeping you here?
- I don't know.
Grooming you, is he?
For what?
You just be careful.
Roper's planning a big arms deal to Apo's Lebanese friend.
Weapons from seven British and American companies... weapons no-one should be trading in.
Roper's using a company called TradePass to fence the deal.
He pretends it trades in agricultural equipment and his investors pretend to believe him.
You can stop rubbing now.
Why are you telling me this?
I just want to be honest with someone in this world.
Does Jed know?
No, of course not!
Sandy screws everyone and tells me everything.
Roper is steadfastly faithful and tells Jed nothing.
Do you think I should tell her?
Maybe.
[HE GRUNTS]
If it's worry for your boy, forget it.
He knew what he was getting into.
Did he?
So, you and Mr Burr, are you making a go of it?
Well, you know, like my mum says, "You make your bed... you die in it."
[HE CHUCKLES]
No, Gordon's a decent man.
It's not his fault I'm not in love with him.
Listen...
Oh, Joel, let's not have that conversation, please?
Well, you can't deny the past.
- Past is all it is.
- It doesn't have to be.
[SHE SIGHS]
Joel...
You silly sod.
[JOEL CHUCKLES]
[BIRDS TWITTER]
Hi, Corky.
Frisky.
Hey, Danny.
Thomas, have you seen my phone?
I haven't.
Sorry.
Dad'll be cross.
Everyone's cross and Jed's not talking to Dad.
What's going on?
I don't know.
I'll tell you what, why don't I come downstairs and read you a bedtime story, and we can look for your phone in the morning?
OK.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
What should we read?
I don't know.
Which one's your favourite?
Three Little Pigs.
OK, the pigs?
I can give you the Thomas version...
Two Little Pigs.
No.
[HE EXHALES]
- [COMPUTER BEEPS]
- What's that?
That right there.
Punch that up.
Punch that up.
What is it?
[COMPUTER BEEPS]
It's your boy.
"Seven tractor firms"...
seven armament manufacturers?
"Home sale with best friend", that's the UK and the US.
"Buyer in Beirut via Worst Man".
Well, Worst Man is Roper.
Roper's the middleman?
- What's TradePass?
- I'm not sure, must be a front organisation.
What I do know, though, is Roper's pressed the green light.
All right.
OK.
Hey, guys...
OK, so, just put the cases by the taxi and then you can jump in.
Good girl.
Pop in.
Jump in.
OK, put your seatbelts on, guys.
[CARO CRIES SOFTLY]
OK...
- OK.
Here we go.
- [ENGINE RUMBLES]
[WOMAN SOBS]
Get in the taxi, you bloody whore!
- Caroline, for...
- You bitch!
Caroline, for Christ's sake, she's going.
She's going.
She's go...
- Caro...
- Bitch!
- Whore!
- Caroline.
- Just shut up!
- All right.
Just shut up, Sandy, you shit!
What, you like the show?
You like the show, Dicky?
Dicky Roper?
[CAR ENGINE REVS]
See you later, guys.
Jed, darling...
Don't even.
Where is everybody?
- Monaco.
- Huh.
Two days of meetings.
Things are ramping up.
And you're not...
- You're not going too?
- Not me, no.
The girl was supposed to go but she's blown him out.
I'm staying with her.
We're going riding instead.
Didn't she invite you?
- Oh, dear.
- [PINE CHUCKLES]
Very good.
Well, have a nice time.
- [CLOCK TICKS] - [INSECT BUZZES]
[HE BREATHES HEAVILY]
[ALARM BLARES]
[ALARM CONTINUES]
- [ALARM STOPS] - [HE EXHALES]
JED:
I'll just be a minute.
What are you doing in here?
I brought you some flowers.
Why didn't you give them to the maids?
- I have to change.
- Close the door.
You can't be in here.
This is our bedroom.
What is that?
I found it on the desktop.
You broke into his office and you spied on his papers.
You have to be more careful.
CORKY:
Darling, Angel, Sweetie, everyone's starving...
- He can't see you.
- Get rid of him.
Are you decent?
- What's going on?
- Nothing.
I'm coming.
_
How was your trip?
Noisy.
I hitched a ride on a C-130.
- Oh, fun.
- How was yours?
Fine, thank you.
I'm not sure why we had to make it.
Is there a reason we're doing this in person?
Well, Halo is not too keen on intermediaries just now.
And yet he's sent you?
There's an enforcement operation called Limpet.
We have to keep our eyes on it.
Halo says you need to be careful.
I am always careful.
How far have they got?
They've drawn a line between Langbourne and Apostol.
- Jesus.
- How did they manage that?
A photograph of a meeting.
Are they after buyers or sellers?
We don't know.
We assume both.
You can assure Halo that we have taken every precaution.
We have received intelligence of our own.
We are changing the guard.
Good.
JED:
How was your meeting?
It was fine.
It was fine?
Don't be so bloody childish!
Look, Caro was upset.
She wanted to get back at Sandy so she started spreading manure.
That's it.
End of story.
That's what it is... it's just a story?
Jesus, Jed, what the hell is the matter with you?
Tell me why I should believe you.
Why shouldn't you believe me?
- When have I ever lied to you?
- Oh, you... you don't lie to me.
You're much too clever for that.
You just hide.
- What?
What do I hide?
- The truth, Roper!
Well, what about your truth?
What about the things you hide from me?
I don't hide anything from you.
You have a child, Jed!
You have a son.
Let's start with him.
Or don't you think he counts?
How do you know that?
We're not talking how, we're talking why.
Why would you hide that from me?
That was not included in the brochure.
Screw your brochure, Roper.
You don't own me.
No-one is entitled to know things about me that I don't want them to know.
Oh, but you're entitled to spy on my life?
I can read a bloody bank statement.
I'm paying money to raise another man's kid.
I know that and now anyone listening to this phone call knows it too.
Apart from that, how was your day?
[PHONE BEEPS]
_
[COMPUTER BEEPS]
[PEN CLATTERS TO FLOOR]
On your feet, soldier.
[HE GRUNTS]
Where the hell did he get that?
- "Halo".
- Yeah.
[BIRDS TWITTER]
They're back?
Apparently so.
The chief wants to see you.
Not you, him.
Present for you on the table.
Thank you.
I told them to put some visas in it and make it look scruffy.
Never trust a new passport, in my view.
Always go with the old 'uns... like Third World taxi drivers, there's a reason they have survived.
"Andrew Birch"?
We like the tree thing, we thought we'd stick with that.
It's all official.
You are reborn.
The visas are real.
If you want to renew, go to the consulate abroad...
less risky.
[PASSPORT CLATTERS TO GROUND]
- What's up?
- Erm, I thought that was my present.
Well, it can be, if you do something for me.
[CHUCKLES] Right.
Sandy, papers.
Mm-hmm.
We're going to need a witness... preferably Spanish so they can't actually read the bloody thing.
I'll get Carlos.
- Is he 18?
- Yeah.
Wait, what is this?
What am I signing?
Jesus, Pine, for a murderer on the run, you're pretty bloody picky.
I am giving you your own company.
[CHUCKLES]
Erm...
Look, I...
Look, I really...
I don't know anything about running a company.
You don't have to.
All you have to do is sign as Andrew Birch.
Why don't you practise a few signatures?
Get the feel of it.
[HE CLEARS HIS THROAT]
Andrew Birch.
B-I-R,
C for Charlie,
H for Hotel.
Go on.
Manly one.
Go for a manly one.
- Andrew Birch in a hurry.
- [CHUCKLES]
[ROPER GROWLS] Andrew Birch.
One more.
That's more like it.
[DOOR OPENS]
Carlos, ven aqui.
- Necesito que firmes esto.
- _
_
_
There and there and one more there.
Carlos, here, right at the bottom.
Good lad.
[DOOR OPENS]
[DOOR CLOSES]
Welcome to the family, Andrew.
*Happy birthday to you*
*Happy birthday to you*
*Happy birthday, dear Elena*
*Happy birthday to you.*
My darling daughter!
The most beautiful girl in the world!
A marvellous necklace from Paris!
The most expensive necklace!
Enjoy the party!
Thank you.
What about austerity, Apo?
This is austerity.
You should have seen our country five years ago.
Tomorrow's business...
By the way, my Arab friend is concerned you can't deliver the merchandise you promised.
I wouldn't worry about that, Apo, it'll be fine.
I hope so.
- Ah, Mr Barghati.
- Sandy.
How good to see you.
Oh, my goodness!
Oh, Lord!
Oh, Lord!
What's happening here?
Que pasa?
Jesus!
Help her!
Help me, please!
Elena!
Elena!
Elena!
Elena!
Elena!
She must've been in so much pain.
Yeah, well, she's caused a lot of other people pain, too.
We had to reschedule that meeting.
Still, the canapes were good.
What do you want to do about our Arab chum?
Bring him out to the villa?
I don't much like that, it's too risky if someone's got a watch on him.
Invite him to the children's party.
There'll be lots of people there, you can do your magic tricks.
Try and get them right.
- Fix it up, will you?
- OK.
Sorry, darling, I don't know what I was thinking, it was a crass thing to say.
Ok... let's go, dream boy.
Come on.
Go left.
Up the stairs.
So the silly sod is insisting on 10% and he is digging his heels in.
All right, we'll let him enjoy that for a week, and then we'll take it away from him.
I'm happy to go with that.
Ah, there he is.
Dans, you're on.
Thank you very much, sir, for rescuing me.
I hope you're feeling better.
You're very welcome.
All right, now scram.
See if you can catch us some mackerel for supper.
And take the dogs, will you?
Go on, Shirley.
Go on, you foul-smelling creature.
You'll call him, will you?
Yep.
Leave it with me, I'll deal with it.
Don't waste any energy trying to sweet-talk him,
- just lay it out, let him sweat.
- All right.
All right, Frisky, no more interruptions, no-one on the terrace.
What the hell is that noise?
Oh, Javier is blowing leaves.
Well, tell him to knock it off, will you?
Cease and desist.
How's the face?
- It's fine.
- We'll be all right.
So, what do you want?
I'd like to... to go back to the restaurant, if that's all right.
That's not what I meant.
What do you want... from the world?
I don't know.
I haven't got a plan.
I'm taking some time out.
Don't believe you.
You've never relaxed in your life.
If you say so.
Just sit down.
Everyone assumes that I was born with a silver spoon in my mouth.
It's balls.
My father was an Oxfordshire auctioneer, taught me the price of everything, but the drive to create all of this, that comes from me and me alone.
Where does it come from in you?
I'm not sure I have what you describe.
OK, you patched me up, I'm very grateful for that, and now I'd like to go.
Corky can't make you out, you see.
Suspicious chap, Corks.
He's got bad vibes about you.
Why did you kill that fellow in Devon?
It's all over the wire.
We had to call the police, no choice.
They'll be here any minute.
You are a cool cucumber, aren't you?
He cheated me.
And you didn't like that?
- No, I didn't.
- Quite right.
The MacArthurs have confirmed for dinner, so... that makes 12 tonight.
Or 13.
Come and tell us why you think this one's a bad apple, Corky?
Well, his references aren't too clever.
Luckily for you, old Jorge was so desperate for a sous chef, he didn't bother to check them.
You faked them, Pine?
I needed the job.
I needed it fast, I didn't have time for formalities.
Where'd you get the passport?
I met a girl... in Devon.
Didn't we all.
Pretty little thing.
Who's Quince?
Her ex.
He'd never been abroad, he'd never had a passport, so I took his name.
You've taken a lot of names, haven't you?
It makes a man wonder who you really are.
So, father killed in Belfast, no close relationship with mother, married once for six months, we can assume not a triumph.
Two tours in Iraq, distinguished service.
And on return, what?
Despair, depression, and then five years as a night owl in the hotel business.
What was that?
Hibernation?
Burying yourself alive?
And then a sudden moment of madness.
Thieving, narcotics... murder.
This is bloody chaos, Jonathan.
Do you even know who you are?
Those two chaps you smashed up in the restaurant, did you know them?
No.
They hadn't eaten there before?
Did they look like they'd eaten there before?
Ever sailed a boat for them?
Is this some kind of interrogation?
Let's pretend it is.
Did you cook for them?
No.
The mussels were marvellous, by the way.
You weren't the lookout guy?
- You didn't switch roles halfway through?
- No.
That's another of Corky's theories.
Listen, I haven't asked for anything, all right?
I don't expect a reward,
I certainly don't appreciate this investigation into my personal life.
And, frankly, I'm bored of your hospitality.
Maybe I'm not squeaky-clean, but nor, I suspect, are you and your little friend here, so maybe we just leave it at that.
Little friend!
I know!
Charmant!
- Where are you going?
- I'm leaving.
What are you going to do for a passport?
I have a passport in the name of Thomas Quince.
Where is it?
Corky, sock him the bad news.
The passport's gone, old love.
Thomas Quince had to be shredded.
What are you talking about?
It's no good getting in a panic, my dear.
Your cover's blown sky-high.
Tom Quince is on every wanted list on God's earth.
Murder, theft, sadly not buggery, but we'll work on that.
That was my passport.
That was mine!
Well, you're going to have to learn to be someone else, aren't you?
I said no-one in here!
Sorry, baby, I didn't know.
Jesus!
Sorry, my darling, I didn't know it was you.
It's actually good news -
Thomas is going to be staying for a while, till he's fighting fit again.
That's great.
You want to come for a swim?
Go on.
Corky can lend you some Speedos.
I'd like to.
Corky, why don't you put him in the fisherman's cottage at the end of the estate,
- while we work out what to do with you.
- All right, boss.
And what am I supposed to do until then?
Well, you can keep Dans company.
We were supposed to have a school friend here for the holiday, but the bugger stood him up.
His mother doesn't approve of me.
One more thing...
I run a tight ship here.
You're right, we do a little swashbuckling every now and then, but we play straight with each other.
Now, you saved my boy and I'm grateful, but if you step out of line... we'll make you howl for your mother.
What size feet have you got?
12.
Now, house rules.
No phones, no postcards to Devon dumplings.
No messages in a bottle.
The chief values privacy... as do we all.
All the way down to the beach, as far as you can go, and it's on the right.
Alternatively, fill your pockets with stones, walk into the sea... and keep going.
Anything?
No.
Bloody hell!
I hate this bit.
Off every tree you may freely eat maids, serving wenches, cooks, typists, masseuses, even the lady who comes to clip the canary's claws.
But if you lay one hand on that precious fruit, then like the Belgians in the Congo, we'll chop it off.
And I don't mean the hand.
Senor Roper.
Morning.
I was wondering if I might take Danny into town?
What for?
A change.
- He likes you, doesn't he?
- I hope so.
I like him.
Frisky and Tabby will go with you.
Pine...
Thank you.
It's me.
They're on the move.
Do you always have this much company, Danny?
Since the restaurant.
- It's a bit boring, isn't it?
- Yeah.
It's OK.
It's all right.
- Danny?
- Yeah.
What do you say... to an ice cream?
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Great.
Actually...
Why don't you ask Frisky and Tabby
- if they want an ice cream as well, huh?
- OK.
- Would you like an ice cream?
- No.
- Really?
Would you?
- No.
They didn't want one.
- They don't want one?
- No.
They are very strange, aren't they, those two?
Yeah, especially on a day like this, who wouldn't want an ice cream?
!
What's your favourite flavour, Danny?
Pistachio.
Danny?
Yeah?
Do you know who's... coming to the party on Sunday?
It's a select group, around 25.
Sorry, I need to hear the complete list, all the names of all your ice creams.
Oh, gracias.
Sorry.
That's all right.
I think Sandy and Caroline will probably be there, won't they?
I don't know who's coming.
You see, I've got this problem, it's Major Corcoran.
I don't think he likes me very much.
- Why not?
- I don't know.
But he's trying to find out everything he can about me.
All the way back to the time of the ancient Egyptians.
Muchos gracias.
Right, waiting's over.
We've got a spot of work to do, thank God.
So, how often do you come here?
Only in the summer.
It must be nice to see Dad, though?
Do you play tennis with him?
I have lessons with Lewis.
Roper's not here much.
Well, I expect he works hard, eh?
That's why he has such a big house.
I bet you've counted the rooms.
23.
There's three kitchens and a big office by the pool.
And there's Roper's secret study in his bedroom, but no-one's allowed in there.
Except you?
Special guest?
I'm not.
He calls it The Citadel.
And there's one key... and he hides it.
Do you know what's inside?
He says it's full of peppermints.
Well, I'd lock it up too if I were him.
Plus, there's an alarm.
They test it every day at 11.
You have to be really careful.
- Why?
- This is where I cut my foot last year.
Roper made me stand in the sea for about half an hour, because of the salt.
Ever since his daughter killed herself, he comes here every day.
And that's not all.
Yesterday afternoon, he calls the hotline of the Madrid Public Prosecutor's Office, says he has information regarding a world-class illegal arms deal.
Operator asks his name, he hangs up.
Assumption, a priest's advice only goes so far.
- Gracias, padre.
- Gracias.
Mr Apostol?
Who are you?
I'm your guardian angel, Mr Apostol.
I can't sleep.
Every night...
I ask myself the same question.
What I could have done?
Now you're having a child...
You can understand how I feel.
I can, Juan.
When you called the Madrid office, you had blood on your hands.
And I'm here to wash it off.
How?
- You know Richard Roper?
- Yes.
- He's a friend.
- Juan, he's not a friend.
He dragged you down and he dragged your daughter down too.
If Roper wasn't in your life, I think she'd still be alive today.
Sorry.
Now, God knows how you bear it, I...
I don't think I could.
Listen, I'm on the side of the angels.
We're good people, we play it straight and we keep our promises.
Ok?
But I need your help.
Do you know Lance Corcoran?
Yes.
He's Roper's right-hand man.
Right, well, that's what needs to change.
Are you pink?
Socialist, left-wing, march of history, that sort of thing?
It wouldn't bother me if you were, it's another one of Corky's bugbears.
He seems to have a few.
Yeah.
Been in a lot of foxholes, me and Corky.
Once spent a week together in a police cell in Delhi.
I don't think I've ever laughed so much in my whole life.
Was he drinking then?
Well, now, that is a deeply odd thing to say.
What business is it of yours how much he drinks?
When my father was serving in Belfast...
A sergeant in his platoon got drunk one night, told a local girl what the next day's operation was.
The man I loved most in the world was dead for five pints of lager and the promise of a quickie.
Right, so you don't drink and you're not pink, what are you?
Me, I'm a free man.
Free to think, free to work, free to climb a mountain or lie in bed all day eating peppermint creams without any bugger telling me how.
Then I'm a free man.
Oh, that's the free part, the man part's a little different.
See, children grow up thinking the adult world is ordered, rational, fit for purpose.
It's crap.
Becoming a man is realising... that it's all rotten.
Realising how to celebrate that rottenness, that's freedom.
Here we are.
Out we go.
Come on.
Chop chop.
Let's go.
Mademoiselle.
- Merci, monsieur.
- OK.
Senor?
The bags, please.
Thank you so much.
Thank you so much for coming.
Have a wonderful day.
Caro, divine as ever.
Sandy, sort of acceptable.
There you go.
Apo, my dear old friend.
- I'm so terribly sorry for your loss.
- Thanks.
How are you?
I can't even imagine.
Mr Barghati, thank you so much for coming.
Please come inside.
Let's see if we can feed and sustain you before we get down to business.
And did you get the sweater?
Great.
Does it fit?
Ok.
Love you.
Bye, honey.
I'm so sorry to interrupt.
The guests are arriving and the party's going to start soon.
The story begins in Egypt 4,500 years ago.
The ancient Egyptians invented this game.
It is literally the oldest trick in the book.
Now, you start with a ball.
We have one, two, three cups.
You lay one cup like that, one cup like that, one cup like that...
All right?
Now, I'm going to take the ball and I'm going to place the ball in the cup.
Shake the cup.
Turn it over.
All right, now, you have to watch very closely.
You have to watch the cups.
I'm going to move these two round like that.
This one round like that.
Everybody clear on where the ball is now?
Danny, where's the ball?
You think the ball's here?
No, Danny, the ball's in the middle!
You're not watching the cups, Danny.
Thomas is watching the cups, aren't you, Thomas?
You're a gym bunny, aren't you?
Aren't you?
A little cold gym bunny...
He can't stop his mouth... in every way.
Corky can get a little overexcited when he's drunk.
Yes, that is what Mr Barghati is worried about.
That little smile...
According to our friend, he has been shooting his mouth off talking about things he should not.
Barghati doesn't want him involved - condition of the deal.
- Thanks for that, Apo.
- Spit.
Yeah!
Come... come with me...
And it's a funny thing, isn't it?
If you want to piss...
I am so sorry to interrupt, but can I just borrow the old man for a second?
Oh, of course.
- Thank you.
- Excuse me.
- Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
I have just spoken to Apo, and he has a...
There you go, Danny.
Thomas.
For God's sake...
Roper, Thomas and I are going to go for a little stroll.
All right, darling.
Frisky, Major Corkoran is here with some friends of Dorothy that I would like to have escorted from the premises.
You and Tabby can make as much noise as you like.
All right?
A pleasure.
Tabbs.
If you need to relieve yourself, it's good to do it into a suitable perspective.
It's better than a urinal, isn't it?
- God's urinal, I call this.
- You've got to break it up.
You're giving the boss indigestion with your buddies here.
Come on, lads.
- The party's over.
- Frisky, go pee-pee.
Leave your drinks here.
Frisky, don't be too rough.
Who are all these people?
How should I know?
You're not curious?
Why should I be?
It's business.
Which is what?
Buying and selling agricultural equipment.
Caro says Sandy tells her everything.
That would drive me insane.
You shouldn't have seen me like that today, in my bedroom.
I'm sorry.
The door was open.
I thought you were dressed.
That's not what I meant.
I don't care who sees me naked.
I do care who sees me crying.
You tell no-one you saw that, is that clear?
Of course.
I'm going swimming.
Want to come?
I don't think that would be wise.
There's no current.
That's not quite what I meant.
I know it wasn't.
There she goes, beyond the ha-ha!
One day, Thomas, you'll live a little.
Erm, come...
Rex, do you have a minute?
The Permanent Secretary would love to see you.
Erm, yes.
Is that a yes or a no?
Rex, come in.
You know Geoffrey Dromgoole, of course,
- and his team from the River.
- Rex.
Barbara Vandon from the American Embassy.
Rex Mayhew, my undersecretary.
- Good to see you, Rex.
- Barbara, how are you?
Rex, it's this Limpet thing.
Limpet?
The Joel Steadman enforcement operation with Angela Burr on side-saddle.
Yes, I know what Limpet is - it's an enforcement case.
It's nothing to do with Langley...
or River House.
Well, it's what Barbara feels we ought to be discussing.
Rex, Langley has been completely railroaded on this.
Currently, we have a joint operation on foreign soil between two extremely fringe outfits.
They're chasing international arms in an area of the world that is... way beyond their comprehension.
It's crazy.
I have to say, I agree.
You know, Limpet is operating in a highly incendiary region, and I would hate to see that run out of control.
In my view, it should be placed under a purely intelligence jurisdiction, acting on a political brief, but it's not my decision.
No, it's not.
I'm sure I don't need to remind you or your team that my recommendation, accepted by the Permanent Secretary, was that River House was overextended, and that enforcement agencies were urgently needed to prosecute any areas of international criminal activity that were,
for whatever reason, slipping through the intelligence net.
In that context, I find the actions of River House somewhat inimical to the new era of parliamentary accountability and transparency.
Does that answer your question?
- Why don't we leave it there for today?
- Thank you.
Have you got a moment?
Not much more than that
- Celia's cooking rabbit.
That's all it will take.
Good job in there.
You pressed all the right buttons - accountability, transparency...
I don't like being bullied, never have.
You see, the thing is, I'm not sure that Limpet's quite the abject failure that Angela Burr would have us believe.
Really?
So, the day that the Limpet case is ours, you get an uncle in Switzerland who has suffered an untimely death... a rich uncle.
I'm going to pretend I didn't hear that.
You're in over your head, Rex.
- It's...
- Don't answer now... but think about it.
Enjoy the rabbit.
Morning.
- Are you not swimming?
- I'm not in the mood.
I like you, Thomas - you see everything and say nothing.
My husband is screwing our nanny.
What a cliche.
Jed said I should have hired an uglier girl but the agency only had stunners.
Could you do my back?
Don't worry, I don't want to sleep with you.
- Why is he keeping you here?
- I don't know.
Grooming you, is he?
For what?
You just be careful.
Roper's planning a big arms deal to Apo's Lebanese friend.
Weapons from seven British and American companies - weapons no-one should be trading in.
Roper's using a company called TradePass to fence the deal.
He pretends it trades in agricultural equipment and his investors pretend to believe him.
You can stop rubbing now.
Why are you telling me this?
I just want to be honest with someone in this world.
Does Jed know?
No, of course not!
Sandy screws everyone and tells me everything.
Roper is steadfastly faithful and tells Jed nothing.
Do you think I should tell her?
Maybe.
If it's worry for your boy, forget it.
He knew what he was getting into.
Did he?
So, you and Mr Burr, are you making a go of it?
Well, you know, like my mum says,
"You make your bed - you die in it."
No, Gordon's a decent man.
It's not his fault I'm not in love with him.
Listen...
Oh, Joel, let's not have that conversation, please?
Well, you can't deny the past.
- Past is all it is.
- It doesn't have to be.
Joel...
You silly sod.
Hi, Corky.
Frisky.
Hey, Danny.
Thomas, have you seen my phone?
I haven't.
Sorry.
Dad'll be cross.
Everyone's cross and Jed's not talking to Dad.
What's going on?
I don't know.
I'll tell you what, why don't I come downstairs and read you a bedtime story, and we can look for your phone in the morning?
OK.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
What should we read?
I don't know.
Which one's your favourite?
Three Little Pigs.
OK, the pigs?
I can give you the Thomas version
- Two Little Pigs.
What's that?
That right there.
Punch that up.
Punch that up.
What is it?
It's your boy.
"Seven tractor firms" - seven armament manufacturers?
"Home sale with best friend" - that's the UK and the US.
"Buyer in Beirut via Worst Man".
Well, Worst Man is Roper
- Roper's the middleman?
- What's TradePass?
- I'm not sure, must be a front organisation.
What I do know, though, is Roper's pressed the green light.
All right.
OK.
Hey, guys...
OK, so, just put the cases by the taxi and then you can jump in.
Good girl.
Pop in.
Jump in.
OK, put your seatbelts on, guys.
Ok...
OK.
Here we go.
Get in the taxi, you bloody whore!
- Caroline, for...
- You bitch!
Caroline, for Christ's sake, she's going.
She's going.
She's go...
Caro...
Bitch!
Whore!
- Caroline.
- Just shut up!
- All right.
- Just shut up, Sandy, you shit!
What, you like the show?
You like the show, Dicky?
Dicky Roper?
See you later, guys.
Jed, darling...
Don't even.
Where is everybody?
Monaco.
Two days of meetings.
Things are ramping up.
And you're not...
- You're not going too?
- Not me, no.
The girl was supposed to go but she's blown him out.
I'm staying with her.
We're going riding instead.
Didn't she invite you?
Oh, dear.
Very good.
Well, have a nice time.
I'll just be a minute.
What are you doing in here?
I brought you some flowers.
Why didn't you give them to the maids?
- I have to change.
- Close the door.
You can't be in here.
This is our bedroom.
What is that?
I found it on the desktop.
You broke into his office and you spied on his papers.
You have to be more careful.
Darling, Angel, Sweetie, everyone's starving...
- He can't see you.
- Get rid of him.
Are you decent?
- What's going on?
- Nothing.
I'm coming.
How was your trip?
Noisy.
I hitched a ride on a C-130.
Oh, fun.
How was yours?
Fine, thank you.
I'm not sure why we had to make it.
Is there a reason we're doing this in person?
Well, Halo is not too keen on intermediaries just now.
And yet he's sent you?
There's an enforcement operation called Limpet.
We have to keep our eyes on it.
Halo says you need to be careful.
I am always careful.
How far have they got?
They've drawn a line between Langbourne and Apostol.
- Jesus.
- How did they manage that?
A photograph of a meeting.
Are they after buyers or sellers?
We don't know.
We assume both.
You can assure Halo that we have taken every precaution.
We have received intelligence of our own.
We are changing the guard.
Good.
'How was your meeting?
'
It was fine.
It was fine?
Don't be so bloody childish!
Look, Caro was upset.
She wanted to get back at Sandy so she started spreading manure.
That's it.
End of story.
That's what it is - it's just a story?
Jesus, Jed, what the hell is the matter with you?
Tell me why I should believe you.
Why shouldn't you believe me?
When have I ever lied to you?
Oh, you... you don't lie to me.
You're much too clever for that.
You just hide.
What?
What do I hide?
The truth, Roper!
Well, what about your truth?
What about the things you hide from me?
I don't hide anything from you.
You have a child, Jed!
You have a son.
Let's start with him.
Or don't you think he counts?
- How do you know?
- We're not talking how, we're talking why.
Why would you hide that from me?
That was not included in the brochure.
Screw your brochure, Roper.
You don't own me.
No-one is entitled to know things about me that I don't want them to know.
Oh, but you're entitled to spy on my life?
I can read a bloody bank statement.
I'm paying money to raise another man's kid.
I know that...
And now anyone listening to this phone call knows it too.
Apart from that, how was your day?
On your feet, soldier.
Where the hell did he get that?
"Halo".
Yeah.
They're back?
Apparently so.
The chief wants to see you.
Not you, him.
Present for you on the table.
Thank you.
I told them to put some visas in it and make it look scruffy.
Never trust a new passport, in my view.
Always go with the old 'uns - like Third World taxi drivers, there's a reason they have survived.
"Andrew Birch"?
We like the tree thing - we thought we'd stick with that.
It's all official.
You are reborn.
The visas are real.
If you want to renew, go to the consulate abroad - less risky.
- What's up?
- Erm, I thought that was my present.
Well, it can be, if you do something for me.
Right.
Sandy, papers.
We're going to need a witness - preferably Spanish so they can't actually read the bloody thing.
I'll get Carlos.
- Is he 18?
- Yeah.
Wait, what is this?
What am I signing?
Jesus, Pine, for a murderer on the run, you're pretty bloody picky.
I am giving you your own company.
Erm...
Look, I...
Look, I really...
I don't know anything about running a company.
You don't have to.
All you have to do is sign as Andrew Birch.
Why don't you practise a few signatures?
Get the feel of it.
Andrew Birch.
BIR B-I-r,
C for Charlie,
H for Hotel.
Go on.
Manly one.
Go for a manly one.
Andrew Birch in a hurry.
Andrew Birch.
One more.
That's more like it.
Carlos, ven aqui.
Necesito que firmes esto.
There and there and one more there.
Carlos, here, right at the bottom.
Good lad.
Welcome to the family, Andrew.
- ALL: ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ - _
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪
♪ Happy birthday, dear Elena ♪
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
My darling daughter!
The most beautiful girl in the world!
[CHEERING]
- A marvellous necklace from Paris!
- ALL:
Ooh!
The most expensive necklace!
[ALL CHANT IN SPANISH]
_
[ALL CHANT IN SPANISH]
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Enjoy the party!
[CHEERING]
[LATIN DANCE MUSIC]
[CORKY LAUGHS]
Thank you.
What about austerity, Apo?
- This is austerity.
- [LAUGHS]
You should have seen our country five years ago.
- Tomorrow's business...
- Uh-huh?
By the way, my Arab friend is concerned you can't deliver the merchandise you promised.
I wouldn't worry about that, Apo, it'll be fine.
I hope so.
- Ah, Mr Barghati.
- Sandy.
How good to see you.
[LATIN DANCE MUSIC]
[SHE WHIMPERS]
Oh, my goodness!
Oh, Lord!
Oh, Lord!
What's happening here?
[MAID SOBS]
- [SHE WHIMPERS]
- Qué pasa?
Qué pasa?
- Qué pasa?
- [SHE SOBS]
[MAID SOBS]
[LATIN DANCE MUSIC]
- Jesus!
- Help her!
Help me, please!
[GASPING] Elena!
Elena!
Elena!
Elena!
Elena!
She must've been in so much pain.
Yeah, well, she's caused a lot of other people pain, too.
We had to reschedule that meeting.
Still, the canapes were good.
What do you want to do about our Arab chum?
Bring him out to the villa?
I don't much like that, it's too risky if someone's got a watch on him.
Invite him to the children's party.
There'll be lots of people there, you can do your magic tricks.
Try and get them right.
- Fix it up, will you?
- OK.
Sorry, darling, I don't know what I was thinking, it was a crass thing to say.
_
- [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] - [SCOFFS]
OK... let's go, dream boy.
Huh!
Come on.
Go left.
Up the stairs.
So the silly sod is insisting on 10% and he is digging his heels in.
All right, we'll let him enjoy that for a week, and then we'll take it away from him.
Yeah, that's fine.
I'm happy to go with that.
Ah, there he is.
Dans, you're on.
Thank you very much, sir, for rescuing me.
I hope you're feeling better.
[CHUCKLES]
You're very welcome.
All right, now scram.
See if you can catch us some mackerel for supper.
And take the dogs, will you?
Go on, Shirley.
Go on, you foul-smelling creature.
You'll call him, will you?
Yep.
Leave it with me, I'll deal with it.
Don't waste any energy trying to sweet-talk him,
- just lay it out, let him sweat.
- All right.
All right, Frisky, no more interruptions,
- no-one on the terrace.
- [BUZZING]
- What the hell is that noise?
- Oh, Javier is blowing leaves.
Well, tell him to knock it off, will you?
Cease and desist.
How's the face?
- It's fine.
- We'll be all right.
- So, what do you want?
- I'd like to... to go back to the restaurant, if that's all right.
That's not what I meant.
What do you want... from the world?
[LEAF BLOWER STOPS]
I don't know.
I haven't got a plan.
I'm taking some time out.
Don't believe you.
You've never relaxed in your life.
If you say so.
Just sit down.
[ROPER SIGHS]
Everyone assumes that I was born with a silver spoon in my mouth.
It's balls.
My father was an Oxfordshire auctioneer, taught me the price of everything, but the drive to create all of this, that comes from me and me alone.
Where does it come from in you?
I'm not sure I have what you describe.
OK, you patched me up, I'm very grateful for that, and now I'd like to go.
Corky can't make you out, you see.
Suspicious chap, Corks.
He's got bad vibes about you.
Why did you kill that fellow in Devon?
It's all over the wire.
We had to call the police, no choice.
They'll be here any minute.
You are a cool cucumber, aren't you?
He cheated me.
And you didn't like that?
- No, I didn't.
- Quite right.
The MacArthurs have confirmed for dinner, so... that makes 12 tonight.
Or 13.
Come and tell us why you think this one's a bad apple, Corky?
Well, his references aren't too clever.
Luckily for you, old Jorge was so desperate for a sous chef, he didn't bother to check them.
You faked them, Pine?
I needed the job.
I needed it fast, I didn't have time for formalities.
Where'd you get the passport?
I met a girl... in Devon.
Didn't we all.
Pretty little thing.
Who's Quince?
Her ex.
He'd never been abroad, he'd never had a passport, so I took his name.
You've taken a lot of names, haven't you?
It makes a man wonder who you really are.
So, father killed in Belfast, no close relationship with mother, married once for six months, we can assume not a triumph.
Two tours in Iraq, distinguished service.
And on return, what?
Despair, depression, and then five years as a night owl in the hotel business.
What was that?
Hibernation?
Burying yourself alive?
And then a sudden moment of madness.
Thieving, narcotics... murder.
[ROPER CHUCKLES SOFTLY]
This is bloody chaos, Jonathan.
Do you even know who you are?
Those two chaps you smashed up in the restaurant, did you know them?
No.
They hadn't eaten there before?
Did they look like they'd eaten there before?
- Ever sailed a boat for them?
- Is this some kind of interrogation?
Let's pretend it is.
Did you cook for them?
No.
The mussels were marvellous, by the way.
So you weren't the lookout guy?
- You didn't switch roles halfway through?
- No.
That's another one of Corky's little theories.
Listen, I haven't asked for anything, all right?
I don't expect a reward,
I certainly don't appreciate this investigation into my personal life.
And, frankly, I'm bored of your hospitality.
Maybe I'm not squeaky-clean, but nor, I suspect, are you and your little friend here, so maybe we just leave it at that.
- Little friend!
- I know!
Charmant!
- Where are you going?
- I'm leaving.
What are you going to do for a passport?
I have a passport in the name of Thomas Quince.
Where is it?
Corky, sock him the bad news.
The passport's gone, old love.
Thomas Quince had to be shredded.
- What are you talking about?
- It's no good getting in a panic, my dear.
Your cover's blown sky-high.
Tom Quince is on every wanted list on God's earth.
Murder, theft, sadly not buggery, but we'll work on that.
That was my passport.
That was mine!
Well, you're going to have to learn to be someone else, aren't you?
[DOOR OPENS]
I said no-one in here!
Sorry, baby, I didn't know.
Jesus!
Sorry, my darling, I didn't know it was you.
It's actually good news.
Thomas is going to be staying for a while,
- till he's fighting fit again.
- Oh.
That's great.
You want to come for a swim?
Go on.
Corky can lend you some Speedos.
- I'd like to.
- [SHE LAUGHS]
Corky, why don't you put him in the fisherman's cottage at the end of the estate...
- while we work out what to do with you.
- All right, boss.
And what am I supposed to do until then?
Well, you can keep Dans company.
We were supposed to have a school friend here for the holiday, but the bugger stood him up.
His mother doesn't approve of me.
One more thing...
I run a tight ship here.
You're right, we do a little swashbuckling every now and then, but we play straight with each other.
Now, you saved my boy and I'm grateful, but if you step out of line... we'll make you howl for your mother.
What size feet have you got?
- 12.
- Hmm.
Now, house rules.
No phones, no postcards to Devon dumplings.
No messages in a bottle.
The chief values privacy... as do we all.
All the way down to the beach, as far as you can go, and it's on the right.
Alternatively, fill your pockets with stones, walk into the sea... and keep going.
Anything?
- No.
- [SHE SIGHS]
Bloody hell!
I hate this bit.
_
Off every tree you may freely eat... maids, serving wenches, cooks, typists, masseuses, even the lady who comes to clip the canary's claws.
But if you lay one hand on that precious fruit, then like the Belgians in the Congo, we'll chop it off.
And I don't mean the hand.
Senor Roper.
Morning.
I was wondering if I might take Danny into town?
What for?
A change.
- He likes you, doesn't he?
- I hope so.
I like him.
Frisky and Tabby will go with you.
Pine thank you.
It's me.
They're on the move.
[BIRDSONG]
Do you always have this much company, Danny?
Since the restaurant.
- It's a bit boring, isn't it?
- Yeah.
Oi!
[DANNY GASPS]
It's OK.
It's all right.
[DANNY LAUGHS]
- Danny?
- Yeah.
What do you say... to an ice cream?
- Yeah?
Great.
- Yeah.
Actually...
[JONATHAN GRUNTS] ...why don't you ask Frisky and Tabby if they want an ice cream as well, huh?
OK.
- Would you like an ice cream?
- No.
- Really?
Would you?
- No.
They didn't want one.
- They don't want one?
- No.
They are very strange, aren't they, those two?
Yeah, especially on a day like this,
- who wouldn't want an ice cream?
!
- [LAUGHS]
What's your favourite flavour, Danny?
- Pistachio.
- Dos pistachios, por favor.
Para mi.
- Danny?
- Yeah?
Do you know who's... coming to the party on Sunday?
It's a select group, around 25.
Senior, por favor...
Sorry, I need to hear the complete list, all the names of all your ice creams.
Oh, gracias.
Sorry.
That's all right.
I think Sandy and Caroline will probably be there, won't they?
I don't know who's coming.
You see, I've got this problem, it's Major Corcoran.
I don't think he likes me very much.
- Why not?
- I don't know.
But he's trying to find out everything he can about me.
All the way back to the time of the ancient Egyptians.
[THEY LAUGH]
Mmm.
Muchos gracias.
Right, waiting's over.
- We've got a spot of work to do,
- All right, come on.
thank God.
- So, how often do you come here?
- Only in the summer.
It must be nice to see Dad, though?
Do you play tennis with him?
I have lessons with Lewis.
- Roper's not here much.
- Well, I expect he works hard, eh?
- That's why he has such a big house.
- I bet you've counted the rooms.
23.
There's three kitchens and a big office by the pool.
And there's Roper's secret study in his bedroom, but no-one's allowed in there.
- Except you?
Special guest?
- I'm not.
He calls it The Citadel.
And there's one key... and he hides it.
Do you know what's inside?
He says it's full of peppermints.
Well, I'd lock it up too if I were him.
[THEY LAUGH]
Plus, there's an alarm.
They test it every day at 11.
You have to be really careful.
Why?
This is where I cut my foot last year.
Roper made me stand in the sea for about half an hour, because of the salt.
[CHURCH BELL CHIMES]
_
Ever since his daughter killed herself, he comes here every day.
And that's not all.
Yesterday afternoon, he calls the hotline of the Madrid Public Prosecutor's Office, says he has information regarding a world-class illegal arms deal.
Operator asks his name, he hangs up.
Assumption, a priest's advice only goes so far.
[PRIEST SPEAKS SPANISH]
- Gracias, padre.
- Gracias.
Mr Apostol?
Who are you?
I'm your guardian angel, Mr Apostol.
I can't sleep.
Every night...
I ask myself the same question.
What I could have done?
[HE SOBS]
[SNIFFLES]
Now you're having a child you can understand how I feel.
I can, Juan.
When you called the Madrid office, you had blood on your hands.
And I'm here to wash it off.
How?
- You know Richard Roper?
- Yes.
- He's a friend.
- Juan, he's not a friend.
He dragged you down and he dragged your daughter down too.
If Roper wasn't in your life, I think she'd still be alive today.
Sorry.
Now, God knows how you bear it, I...
I don't think I could.
Listen, I'm on the side of the angels.
We're good people, we play it straight and we keep our promises.
OK?
But I need your help.
Do you know Lance Corcoran?
Yes.
He's Dicky Roper's right-hand man.
Right, well, that's what needs to change.
Are you pink?
Socialist, left-wing, march of history, that sort of thing?
It wouldn't bother me if you were, it's another one of Corky's bugbears.
He seems to have a few.
Yeah.
Been in a lot of foxholes, me and Corky.
Once spent a week together in a police cell in Delhi.
I don't think I've ever laughed so much in my whole life.
Was he drinking then?
Well, now, that is a deeply odd thing to say.
What business is it of yours how much he drinks?
When my father was serving in Belfast a sergeant in his platoon got drunk one night, told a local girl what the next day's operation was.
The man I loved most in the world was dead for five pints of lager and the promise of a quickie.
Right, so you don't drink and you're not pink, what are you?
Me, I'm a free man.
Free to think, free to work, free to climb a mountain or lie in bed all day eating peppermint creams without any bugger telling me how.
Then I'm a free man.
Oh, that's the free part, the man part's a little different.
See, children grow up thinking the adult world is ordered, rational, fit for purpose.
It's crap.
Becoming a man is realising... that it's all rotten.
Realising how to celebrate that rottenness, that's freedom.
SANDY:
Here we are.
WOMAN:
Out we go.
[SANDY GROANS]
Come on.
Chop chop.
Let's go.
Mademoiselle.
[SHE GIGGLES]
- Merci, monsieur.
- OK.
Senor?
The bags, please.
Thank you so much.
[DOOR CLOSES]
Thank you so much for coming.
Have a wonderful day.
Caro, divine as ever.
- Sandy, sort of acceptable.
- There you go.
Apo, my dear old friend.
- I'm so terribly sorry for your loss.
- Thanks.
How are you?
I can't even imagine.
Mr Barghati, thank you so much for coming.
Please come inside.
Let's see if we can feed and sustain you before we get down to business.
And did you get the sweater?
Great.
Does it fit?
Mmm.
Uh-huh.
OK.
Love you.
Bye, honey.
[SHE SOBS]
- [KNOCK AT DOOR] - [SHE GASPS]
I'm so sorry to interrupt.
The guests are arriving and the party's going to start soon.
The story begins in Egypt 4,500 years ago.
The ancient Egyptians invented this game.
It is literally the oldest trick in the book.
Now, you start with a ball.
We have one, two, three cups.
You lay one cup like that, one cup like that, one cup like that...
All right?
Now, I'm going to take the ball and I'm going to place the ball in the cup.
Shake the cup.
Turn it over.
All right, now, you have to watch very closely.
You have to watch the cups.
I'm going to move these two round like that.
This one round like that.
Everybody clear on where the ball is now?
Danny, where's the ball?
You think the ball's here?
- No, Danny, the ball's in the middle!
- [LAUGHTER]
You're not watching the cups, Danny.
Thomas is watching the cups, aren't you, Thomas?
You're a gym bunny, aren't you?
Aren't you?
A little cold gym bunny...
He can't stop his mouth... in every way.
Corky can get a little overexcited when he's drunk.
Yes, that is what Mr Barghati is worried about.
That little smile...
According to our friend, he has been shooting his mouth off... talking about things he should not.
Barghati doesn't want him involved... condition of the deal.
- Thanks for that, Apo.
- CORKY:
Spit.
Yeah!
[LAUGHS]
Come...
Come with me...
And it's a funny thing, isn't it?
If you want to piss...
I am so sorry to interrupt, but can I just borrow the old man for a second?
- Oh, of course.
- Thank you.
- Excuse me.
- Bye.
Bye.
I have just spoken to Apo, and he has a...
There you go, Danny.
Thomas.
ROPER:
For God's sake...
Roper,
Thomas and I are going to go for a little stroll.
All right, darling.
Frisky, Major Corkoran is here with some friends of Dorothy that I would like to have escorted from the premises.
You and Tabby can make as much noise as you like.
All right?
- A pleasure.
- Tabbs.
CORKY:
If you need to relieve yourself, it's good to do it into a suitable perspective.
It's better than a urinal, isn't it?
- God's urinal, I call this.
- You've got to break it up.
You're giving the boss indigestion with your buddies here.
- Come on, lads.
The party's over.
- Frisky, go pee-pee.
Leave your drinks here.
Frisky, don't be too rough.
[WATER SPLASHES]
Who are all these people?
How should I know?
You're not curious?
Why should I be?
- It's business.
- Which is what?
Buying and selling agricultural equipment.
Caro says Sandy tells her everything.
That would drive me insane.
You shouldn't have seen me like that today, in my bedroom.
I'm sorry.
The door was open.
I thought you were dressed.
That's not what I meant.
I don't care who sees me naked.
I do care who sees me crying.
You tell no-one you saw that, is that clear?
Of course.
I'm going swimming.
- Want to come?
- Ah...
I don't think that would be wise.
There's no current.
[DRESS UNZIPS]
That's not quite what I meant.
I know it wasn't.
[HE SIGHS]
There she goes, beyond the ha-ha!
One day, Thomas, you'll live a little.

- [KNOCK AT DOOR]
- Erm, come...
Rex, do you have a minute?
The Permanent Secretary would love to see you.
Erm, yes.
- Is that a yes or a no?
- Mm-hmm.
- [DOOR OPENS]
- Rex, come in.
- You know Geoffrey Dromgoole, of course,
- Geoffrey.
- and his team from the River.
- Rex.
Barbara Vandon from the American Embassy.
Rex Mayhew, my undersecretary.
- Good to see you, Rex.
- Barbara, how are you?
Rex, it's this Limpet thing.
Limpet?
The Joel Steadman enforcement operation with Angela Burr on side-saddle.
Yes, I know what Limpet is...
it's an enforcement case.
It's nothing to do with Langley... or River House.
Well, it's what Barbara feels we ought to be discussing.
Rex, Langley has been completely railroaded on this.
Currently, we have a joint operation on foreign soil between two extremely fringe outfits.
They're chasing international arms in an area of the world that is... way beyond their comprehension.
It's crazy.
I have to say, I agree.
You know, Limpet is operating in a highly incendiary region, and I would hate to see that run out of control.
In my view, it should be placed under a purely intelligence jurisdiction, acting on a political brief,
- but, it's not my decision.
- [SIRENS WAIL]
No, it's not.
I'm sure I don't need to remind you or your team that my recommendation, accepted by the Permanent Secretary, was that River House was overextended, and that enforcement agencies were urgently needed to prosecute any areas of international criminal activity that were,
for whatever reason, slipping through the intelligence net.
In that context, I find the actions of River House somewhat inimical to the new era of parliamentary accountability and transparency.
Does that answer your question?
- Why don't we leave it there for today?
- Thank you.
[DOOR OPENS AND SLAMS]
Have you got a moment?
Not much more than that...
Celia's cooking rabbit.
- That's all it will take.
- [HE SNIFFS]
Good job in there.
You pressed all the right buttons...
accountability, transparency...
I don't like being bullied, never have.
You see, the thing is, I'm not sure that Limpet's quite the abject failure that Angela Burr would have us believe.
Really?
So, the day that the Limpet case is ours, you get an uncle in Switzerland who has suffered an untimely death... a rich uncle.
I'm going to pretend I didn't hear that.
You're in over your head, Rex.
- It's...
- Don't answer now... but think about it.
Enjoy the rabbit.
- Morning.
- Hi.
- Are you not swimming?
- I'm not in the mood.
I like you, Thomas...
You see everything and say nothing.
[SHE SOBS]
My husband is screwing our nanny.
[SNIFFLES]
What a cliché.
Jed said I should have hired an uglier girl but the agency only had stunners. [SHE SNIFFLES]
Could you do my back?
Don't worry, I don't want to sleep with you.
- Why is he keeping you here?
- I don't know.
Grooming you, is he?
For what?
You just be careful.
Roper's planning a big arms deal to Apo's Lebanese friend.
Weapons from seven British and American companies... weapons no-one should be trading in.
Roper's using a company called TradePass to fence the deal.
He pretends it trades in agricultural equipment and his investors pretend to believe him.
You can stop rubbing now.
Why are you telling me this?
I just want to be honest with someone in this world.
Does Jed know?
No, of course not!
Sandy screws everyone and tells me everything.
Roper is steadfastly faithful and tells Jed nothing.
Do you think I should tell her?
Maybe.
[HE GRUNTS]
If it's worry for your boy, forget it.
He knew what he was getting into.
Did he?
So, you and Mr Burr, are you making a go of it?
Well, you know, like my mum says, "You make your bed... you die in it."
[HE CHUCKLES]
No, Gordon's a decent man.
It's not his fault I'm not in love with him.
Listen...
Oh, Joel, let's not have that conversation, please?
Well, you can't deny the past.
- Past is all it is.
- It doesn't have to be.
[SHE SIGHS]
Joel...
You silly sod.
[JOEL CHUCKLES]
[BIRDS TWITTER]
Hi, Corky.
Frisky.
Hey, Danny.
Thomas, have you seen my phone?
I haven't.
Sorry.
Dad'll be cross.
Everyone's cross and Jed's not talking to Dad.
What's going on?
I don't know.
I'll tell you what, why don't I come downstairs and read you a bedtime story, and we can look for your phone in the morning?
OK.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
What should we read?
I don't know.
Which one's your favourite?
Three Little Pigs.
OK, the pigs?
I can give you the Thomas version...
Two Little Pigs.
No.
[HE EXHALES]
- [COMPUTER BEEPS]
- What's that?
That right there.
Punch that up.
Punch that up.
What is it?
[COMPUTER BEEPS]
It's your boy.
"Seven tractor firms"...
seven armament manufacturers?
"Home sale with best friend", that's the UK and the US.
"Buyer in Beirut via Worst Man".
Well, Worst Man is Roper.
Roper's the middleman?
- What's TradePass?
- I'm not sure, must be a front organisation.
What I do know, though, is Roper's pressed the green light.
All right.
OK.
Hey, guys...
OK, so, just put the cases by the taxi and then you can jump in.
Good girl.
Pop in.
Jump in.
OK, put your seatbelts on, guys.
[CARO CRIES SOFTLY]
OK...
- OK.
Here we go.
- [ENGINE RUMBLES]
[WOMAN SOBS]
Get in the taxi, you bloody whore!
- Caroline, for...
- You bitch!
Caroline, for Christ's sake, she's going.
She's going.
She's go...
- Caro...
- Bitch!
- Whore!
- Caroline.
- Just shut up!
- All right.
Just shut up, Sandy, you shit!
What, you like the show?
You like the show, Dicky?
Dicky Roper?
[CAR ENGINE REVS]
See you later, guys.
Jed, darling...
Don't even.
Where is everybody?
- Monaco.
- Huh.
Two days of meetings.
Things are ramping up.
And you're not...
- You're not going too?
- Not me, no.
The girl was supposed to go but she's blown him out.
I'm staying with her.
We're going riding instead.
Didn't she invite you?
- Oh, dear.
- [PINE CHUCKLES]
Very good.
Well, have a nice time.

JED:
I'll just be a minute.
What are you doing in here?
I brought you some flowers.
Why didn't you give them to the maids?
- I have to change.
- Close the door.
You can't be in here.
This is our bedroom.
What is that?
I found it on the desktop.
You broke into his office and you spied on his papers.
You have to be more careful.
CORKY:
Darling, Angel, Sweetie, everyone's starving...
- He can't see you.
- Get rid of him.
Are you decent?
- What's going on?
- Nothing.
I'm coming.
_
How was your trip?
Noisy.
I hitched a ride on a C-130.
- Oh, fun.
- How was yours?
Fine, thank you.
I'm not sure why we had to make it.
Is there a reason we're doing this in person?
Well, Halo is not too keen on intermediaries just now.
And yet he's sent you?
There's an enforcement operation called Limpet.
We have to keep our eyes on it.
Halo says you need to be careful.
I am always careful.
How far have they got?
They've drawn a line between Langbourne and Apostol.
- Jesus.
- How did they manage that?
A photograph of a meeting.
Are they after buyers or sellers?
We don't know.
We assume both.
You can assure Halo that we have taken every precaution.
We have received intelligence of our own.
We are changing the guard.
Good.
JED:
How was your meeting?
It was fine.
It was fine?
Don't be so bloody childish!
Look, Caro was upset.
She wanted to get back at Sandy so she started spreading manure.
That's it.
End of story.
That's what it is... it's just a story?
Jesus, Jed, what the hell is the matter with you?
Tell me why I should believe you.
Why shouldn't you believe me?
- When have I ever lied to you?
- Oh, you... you don't lie to me.
You're much too clever for that.
You just hide.
- What?
What do I hide?
- The truth, Roper!
Well, what about your truth?
What about the things you hide from me?
I don't hide anything from you.
You have a child, Jed!
You have a son.
Let's start with him.
Or don't you think he counts?
How do you know that?
We're not talking how, we're talking why.
Why would you hide that from me?
That was not included in the brochure.
Screw your brochure, Roper.
You don't own me.
No-one is entitled to know things about me that I don't want them to know.
Oh, but you're entitled to spy on my life?
I can read a bloody bank statement.
I'm paying money to raise another man's kid.
I know that and now anyone listening to this phone call knows it too.
Apart from that, how was your day?
[PHONE BEEPS]
_
[COMPUTER BEEPS]
[PEN CLATTERS TO FLOOR]
On your feet, soldier.
[HE GRUNTS]
Where the hell did he get that?
- "Halo".
- Yeah.
[BIRDS TWITTER]
They're back?
Apparently so.
The chief wants to see you.
Not you, him.
Present for you on the table.
Thank you.
I told them to put some visas in it and make it look scruffy.
Never trust a new passport, in my view.
Always go with the old 'uns... like Third World taxi drivers, there's a reason they have survived.
"Andrew Birch"?
We like the tree thing, we thought we'd stick with that.
It's all official.
You are reborn.
The visas are real.
If you want to renew, go to the consulate abroad...
less risky.
[PASSPORT CLATTERS TO GROUND]
- What's up?
- Erm, I thought that was my present.
Well, it can be, if you do something for me.
[CHUCKLES] Right.
Sandy, papers.
Mm-hmm.
We're going to need a witness... preferably Spanish so they can't actually read the bloody thing.
I'll get Carlos.
- Is he 18?
- Yeah.
Wait, what is this?
What am I signing?
Jesus, Pine, for a murderer on the run, you're pretty bloody picky.
I am giving you your own company.
[CHUCKLES]
Erm...
Look, I...
Look, I really...
I don't know anything about running a company.
You don't have to.
All you have to do is sign as Andrew Birch.
Why don't you practise a few signatures?
Get the feel of it.
[HE CLEARS HIS THROAT]
Andrew Birch.
B-I-R,
C for Charlie,
H for Hotel.
Go on.
Manly one.
Go for a manly one.
- Andrew Birch in a hurry.
- [CHUCKLES]
[ROPER GROWLS] Andrew Birch.
One more.
That's more like it.
[DOOR OPENS]
Carlos, ven aqui.
- Necesito que firmes esto.

There and there and one more there.

[LATIN DANCE MUSIC]
[CORKY LAUGHS]
Thank you.
What about austerity, Apo?
This is austerity.
You should have seen our country five years ago.
- Tomorrow's business...
- Uh-huh?
By the way, my Arab friend is concerned you can't deliver the merchandise you promised.
- I wouldn't worry about that, Apo, it'll be fine.
- I hope so.
- Ah, Mr Barghati.
- Sandy.
- How good to see you.
[LATIN DANCE MUSIC]
[SHE WHIMPERS]
Oh, my goodness!
Oh, Lord!
Oh, Lord!
What's happening here?
[MAID SOBS]
[SHE WHIMPERS] [JUAN SPEAKS SPANISH]
- Que pasa?
- [SHE SOBS]
[MAID SOBS]
[LATIN DANCE MUSIC]
- Jesus!
- Help her!
Help me, please!
Elena!
Elena!
Elena!
Elena!
ELENA!
She must've been in so much pain.
Yeah, well, she's caused a lot of other people pain, too.
We had to reschedule that meeting.
Still, the canapes were good.
What do you want to do about our Arab chum?
Bring him out to the villa?
I don't much like that, it's too risky if someone's got a watch on him.
Invite him to the children's party.
There'll be lots of people there, you can do your magic tricks.
Try and get them right.
- Fix it up, will you?
- OK.
Sorry, darling, I don't know what I was thinking, it was a crass thing to say.
OK... let's go, dream boy.
Huh!
Come on.
Go left.
Up the stairs.
So the silly sod is insisting on 10% and he is digging his heels in.
All right, we'll let him enjoy that for a week, and then we'll take it away from him.
I'm happy to go with that.
Ah, there he is.
Dans, you're on.
Thank you very much, sir, for rescuing me.
I hope you're feeling better.
You're very welcome.
All right, now scram.
See if you can catch us some mackerel for supper.
And take the dogs, will you?
Go on, Shirley.
Go on, you foul-smelling creature.
- You'll call him, will you?
- Yep.
Leave it with me, I'll deal with it.
Don't waste any energy trying to sweet-talk him,
- just lay it out, let him sweat.
- All right.
All right, Frisky, no more interruptions,
- no-one on the terrace.
- [BUZZING]
- What the hell is that noise?
- Oh, Javier is blowing leaves.
Well, tell him to knock it off, will you?
Cease and desist.
How's the face?
- It's fine.
- We'll be all right.
- So, what do you want?
- I'd like to... to go back to the restaurant, if that's all right.
That's not what I meant.
What do you want... from the world?
[LEAF BLOWER STOPS] I don't know.
- I haven't got a plan.
I'm taking some time out.
- Don't believe you.
You've never relaxed in your life.
If you say so.
Just sit down.
[ROPER SIGHS]
Everyone assumes that I was born with a silver spoon in my mouth.
It's balls.
My father was an Oxfordshire auctioneer, taught me the price of everything, but the drive to create all of this, that comes from me and me alone.
Where does it come from in you?
I'm not sure I have what you describe.
OK, you patched me up, I'm very grateful for that,
- and now I'd like to go.
- Corky can't make you out, you see.
Suspicious chap, Corks.
He's got bad vibes about you.
Why did you kill that fellow in Devon?
It's all over the wire.
We had to call the police, no choice.
They'll be here any minute.
You are a cool cucumber, aren't you?
He cheated me.
And you didn't like that?
- No, I didn't.
- Quite right.
The MacArthurs have confirmed for dinner, so... that makes 12 tonight.
Or 13.
Come and tell us why you think this one's a bad apple, Corky?
Well, his references aren't too clever.
Luckily for you, old Jorge was so desperate for a sous chef, he didn't bother to check them.
You faked them, Pine?
I needed the job.
I needed it fast, I didn't have time for formalities.
Where'd you get the passport?
I met a girl... in Devon.
Didn't we all.
Pretty little thing.
Who's Quince?
Her ex.
He'd never been abroad, he'd never had a passport, so I took his name.
You've taken a lot of names, haven't you?
It makes a man wonder who you really are.
So, father killed in Belfast, no close relationship with mother, married once for six months, we can assume not a triumph.
Two tours in Iraq, distinguished service.
And on return, what?
Despair, depression, and then five years as a night owl in the hotel business.
What was that?
Hibernation?
Burying yourself alive?
And then a sudden moment of madness.
Thieving, narcotics... murder.
[ROPER CHUCKLES SOFTLY]
This is bloody chaos, Jonathan.
Do you even know who you are?
Those two chaps you smashed up in the restaurant, did you know them?
- No.
- They hadn't eaten there before?
Did they look like they'd eaten there before?
- Ever sailed a boat for them?
- Is this some kind of interrogation?
- Let's pretend it is.
Did you cook for them?
- No.
- The mussels were marvellous, by the way.
- You weren't the lookout guy?
- You didn't switch roles halfway through?
- No.
That's another of Corky's theories.
Listen, I haven't asked for anything, all right?
I don't expect a reward,
I certainly don't appreciate this investigation into my personal life.
And, frankly, I'm bored of your hospitality.
Maybe I'm not squeaky-clean, but nor, I suspect, are you and your little friend here, so maybe we just leave it at that.
- Little friend!
- I know!
Charmant!
- Where are you going?
- I'm leaving.
What are you going to do for a passport?
I have a passport in the name of Thomas Quince.
Where is it?
Corky, sock him the bad news.
The passport's gone, old love.
Thomas Quince had to be shredded.
- What are you talking about?
- It's no good getting in a panic, my dear.
Your cover's blown sky-high.
Tom Quince is on every wanted list on God's earth.
Murder, theft, sadly not buggery, but we'll work on that.
That was my passport.
That was mine!
Well, you're going to have to learn to be someone else, aren't you?
[DOOR OPENS]
I said no-one in here!
Sorry, baby, I didn't know.
Jesus!
Sorry, my darling, I didn't know it was you.
It's actually good news.
Thomas is going to be staying for a while,
- till he's fighting fit again.
- Oh.
That's great.
You want to come for a swim?
Go on.
Corky can lend you some Speedos.
- I'd like to.
- [SHE LAUGHS]
Corky, why don't you put him in the fisherman's cottage at the end of the estate,
- while we work out what to do with you.
- All right, boss.
And what am I supposed to do until then?
Well, you can keep Dans company.
We were supposed to have a school friend here for the holiday, but the bugger stood him up.
His mother doesn't approve of me.
One more thing I run a tight ship here.
You're right, we do a little swashbuckling every now and then, but we play straight with each other.
Now, you saved my boy and I'm grateful, but if you step out of line... we'll make you howl for your mother.
What size feet have you got?
- 12.
- Hmm.
Now, house rules.
No phones, no postcards to Devon dumplings.
No messages in a bottle.
The chief values privacy... as do we all.
All the way down to the beach, as far as you can go, and it's on the right.
Alternatively, fill your pockets with stones, walk into the sea... and keep going.
Anything?
- No.
- [SHE SIGHS]
Bloody hell!
I hate this bit.
Off every tree you may freely eat - maids, serving wenches, cooks, typists, masseuses, even the lady who comes to clip the canary's claws.
But if you lay one hand on that precious fruit, then like the Belgians in the Congo, we'll chop it off.
And I don't mean the hand.
Senor Roper.
Morning.
I was wondering if I might take Danny into town?
What for?
A change.
- He likes you, doesn't he?
- I hope so.
I like him.
Frisky and Tabby will go with you.
Pine thank you.
It's me.
They're on the move.
[BIRDSONG]
Do you always have this much company, Danny?
Since the restaurant.
- It's a bit boring, isn't it?
- Yeah.
Oi!
[DANNY GASPS]
It's OK.
It's all right.
[DANNY LAUGHS]
- Danny?
- Yeah.
What do you say to an ice cream?
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
- Great.
Actually...
[JONATHAN GRUNTS] ...why don't you ask Frisky and Tabby
- if they want an ice cream as well, huh?
- OK.
Would you like an ice cream?
- No.
- Really?
Would you?
- No.
- They didn't want one.
- They don't want one?
- No.
They are very strange, aren't they, those two?
Yeah, especially on a day like this, who wouldn't want an ice cream?
!
What's your favourite flavour, Danny?
- Pistachio.
- [JONATHAN ORDERS IN SPANISH]
[MAN REPLIES IN SPANISH]
- Danny?
- Yeah?
Do you know who's...
coming to the party on Sunday?
It's a select group, around 25.
[ANGELA SPEAKS SPANISH]
Sorry, I need to hear the complete list, all the names of all your ice creams.
Oh, gracias.
Sorry.
That's all right.
I think Sandy and Caroline will probably be there, won't they?
I don't know who's coming.
You see, I've got this problem, it's Major Corcoran.
- I don't think he likes me very much.
- Why not?
- I don't know.
But he's trying to find out everything he can about me.
All the way back to the time of the ancient Egyptians.
[THEY LAUGH]
Mmm.
Muchos gracias.
Right, waiting's over.
We've got a spot of work to do, thank God.
- So, how often do you come here?
- Only in the summer.
It must be nice to see Dad, though?
Do you play tennis with him?
I have lessons with Lewis.
- Roper's not here much.
- Well, I expect he works hard, eh?
- That's why he has such a big house.
- I bet you've counted the rooms. - 23.
There's three kitchens and a big office by the pool.
And there's Roper's secret study in his bedroom, but no-one's allowed in there.
- Except you?
Special guest?
- I'm not.
He calls it The Citadel.
And there's one key... and he hides it.
- Do you know what's inside?
- He says it's full of peppermints.
Well, I'd lock it up too if I were him.
[THEY LAUGH]
Plus, there's an alarm.
They test it every day at 11.
You have to be really careful.
- Why?
- This is where I cut my foot last year.
Roper made me stand in the sea for about half an hour, because of the salt.
[CHURCH BELL CHIMES]
Ever since his daughter killed herself, he comes here every day.
And that's not all.
Yesterday afternoon, he calls the hotline of the Madrid Public Prosecutor's Office, says he has information regarding a world-class illegal arms deal.
Operator asks his name, he hangs up.
Assumption, a priest's advice only goes so far.
[PRIEST SPEAKS SPANISH]
- Gracias, padre.
- Gracias.
Mr Apostol?
Who are you?
I'm your guardian angel, Mr Apostol.
I can't sleep.
Every night...
I ask myself the same question.
What I could have done?
[HE SOBS]
Now you're having a child you can understand how I feel.
I can, Juan.
When you called the Madrid office, you had blood on your hands.
And I'm here to wash it off.
How?
- You know Richard Roper?
- Yes.
- He's a friend.
- Juan, he's not a friend.
He dragged you down and he dragged your daughter down too.
If Roper wasn't in your life, I think she'd still be alive today.
Sorry.
Now, God knows how you bear it, I...
I don't think I could.
Listen, I'm on the side of the angels.
We're good people, we play it straight and we keep our promises.
OK?
But I need your help.
Do you know Lance Corcoran?
Yes.
He's Roper's right-hand man.
Right, well, that's what needs to change.
Are you pink?
Socialist, left-wing, march of history, that sort of thing?
It wouldn't bother me if you were, it's another one of Corky's bugbears.
He seems to have a few.
Yeah.
Been in a lot of foxholes, me and Corky.
Once spent a week together in a police cell in Delhi.
I don't think I've ever laughed so much in my whole life.
Was he drinking then?
Well, now, that is a deeply odd thing to say.
What business is it of yours how much he drinks?
When my father was serving in Belfast a sergeant in his platoon got drunk one night, told a local girl what the next day's operation was.
The man I loved most in the world was dead for five pints of lager and the promise of a quickie.
Right, so you don't drink and you're not pink, what are you?
Me, I'm a free man.
Free to think, free to work, free to climb a mountain or lie in bed all day eating peppermint creams without any bugger telling me how.
Then I'm a free man.
Oh, that's the free part, the man part's a little different.
See, children grow up thinking the adult world is ordered, rational, fit for purpose.
It's crap.
Becoming a man is realising...
that it's all rotten.
Realising how to celebrate that rottenness, that's freedom.
SANDY:
Here we are.
WOMAN:
Out we go.
[SANDY GROANS]
Come on.
Chop chop.
Let's go.
- Mademoiselle.
- [SHE GIGGLES]
- Merci, monsieur.
- OK.
Senor?
The bags, please.
Thank you so much.
Thank you so much for coming.
Have a wonderful day.
Caro, divine as ever.
Sandy, sort of acceptable.
There you go.
Apo, my dear old friend.
- I'm so terribly sorry for your loss.
- Thanks.
How are you?
I can't even imagine.
Mr Barghati, thank you so much for coming.
Please come inside.
Let's see if we can feed and sustain you before we get down to business.
And did you get the sweater?
Great.
Does it fit?
Mmm.
Uh-huh.
OK.
Love you.
Bye, honey.
[SHE SOBS]
[KNOCK AT DOOR] [SHE GASPS]
I'm so sorry to interrupt.
The guests are arriving and the party's going to start soon.
The story begins in Egypt 4,500 years ago.
The ancient Egyptians invented this game.
It is literally the oldest trick in the book.
Now, you start with a ball.
We have one, two, three cups.
You lay one cup like that, one cup like that, one cup like that...
All right?
Now, I'm going to take the ball and I'm going to place the ball in the cup.
Shake the cup.
Turn it over.
All right, now, you have to watch very closely.
You have to watch the cups.
I'm going to move these two round like that.
This one round like that.
Everybody clear on where the ball is now?
Danny, where's the ball?
You think the ball's here?
- No, Danny, the ball's in the middle!
- [LAUGHTER]
You're not watching the cups, Danny.
Thomas is watching the cups, aren't you, Thomas?
You're a gym bunny, aren't you?
Aren't you?
A little cold gym bunny...
He can't stop his mouth, in every way.
Corky can get a little overexcited when he's drunk.
- Yes, that is what Mr Barghati is worried about.
- That little smile...
- Oh, hello!
- According to our friend, he has been shooting his mouth off - talking about things he should not.
Barghati doesn't want him involved:
condition of the deal.
- Thanks for that, Apo.
- Spit.
Yeah!
CORKY LAUGHS
Come...
Come with me...
And it's a funny thing, isn't it?
If you want to piss...
I am so sorry to interrupt,
- but can I just borrow the old man for a second?
- Oh, of course.
- Thank you.
- Excuse me.
- Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
I have just spoken to Apo, and he has a...
There you go, Danny.
Thomas.
ROPER:
For God's sake...
Roper, Thomas and I are going to go for a little stroll.
All right, darling.
Frisky, Major Corkoran is here with some friends of Dorothy that I would like to have escorted from the premises.
You and Tabby can make as much noise as you like.
All right?
A pleasure.
Tabbs.
CORKY:
If you need to relieve yourself, it's good to do it into a suitable perspective.
It's better than a urinal, isn't it?
- God's urinal, I call this.
- You've got to break it up.
You're giving the boss indigestion with your buddies here.
- Come on, lads.
The party's over.
- Frisky, go pee-pee.
Leave your drinks here.
Frisky, don't be too rough.
[WATER SPLASHES]
Who are all these people?
How should I know?
You're not curious?
Why should I be?
It's business.
Which is what?
Buying and selling agricultural equipment.
Caro says Sandy tells her everything.
That would drive me insane.
You shouldn't have seen me like that today, in my bedroom.
I'm sorry.
The door was open.
I thought you were dressed.
That's not what I meant.
I don't care who sees me naked.
I do care who sees me crying.
You tell no-one you saw that, is that clear?
Of course.
I'm going swimming.
- Want to come?
- Ah...
I don't think that would be wise.
There's no current.
[DRESS UNZIPS]
That's not quite what I meant.
I know it wasn't.
[HE SIGHS]
There she goes, beyond the ha-ha!
One day, Thomas, you'll live a little.

[INSECTS CHIRP]
[TRAFFIC RUMBLES]
[SIRENS WAIL]
- [KNOCK AT DOOR]
- Erm, come...
Rex, do you have a minute?
The Permanent Secretary would love to see you.
Erm, yes.
- Is that a yes or a no?
- Mm-hmm. - [WOMAN LAUGHS]
- [DOOR OPENS]
- Rex, come in.
You know Geoffrey Dromgoole, of course,
- and his team from the River.
- Rex.
Barbara Vandon from the American Embassy.
Rex Mayhew, my undersecretary.
- Good to see you, Rex.
- Barbara, how are you?
Rex, it's this Limpet thing.
Limpet?
The Joel Steadman enforcement operation with Angela Burr on side-saddle.
Yes, I know what Limpet is, it's an enforcement case.
It's nothing to do with Langley...
or River House.
Well, it's what Barbara feels we ought to be discussing.
Rex, Langley has been completely railroaded on this.
Currently, we have a joint operation on foreign soil between two extremely fringe outfits.
They're chasing international arms in an area of the world that is... way beyond their comprehension.
It's crazy.
I have to say, I agree.
You know, Limpet is operating in a highly incendiary region, and I would hate to see that run out of control.
In my view, it should be placed under a purely intelligence jurisdiction, acting on a political brief,
- but it's not my decision.
- [SIRENS WAIL]
No, it's not.
I'm sure I don't need to remind you or your team that my recommendation, accepted by the Permanent Secretary, was that River House was overextended, and that enforcement agencies were urgently needed to prosecute any areas of international criminal activity that were,
for whatever reason, slipping through the intelligence net.
In that context, I find the actions of River House somewhat inimical to the new era of parliamentary accountability and transparency.
Does that answer your question?
- Why don't we leave it there for today?
- Thank you.
[DOOR OPENS AND SLAMS]
Have you got a moment?
Not much more than that:
Celia's cooking rabbit.
- That's all it will take.
- [HE SNIFFS]
Good job in there.
You pressed all the right buttons:
accountability, transparency...
I don't like being bullied, never have.
You see, the thing is, I'm not sure that Limpet's quite the abject failure that Angela Burr would have us believe.
Really?
So, the day that the Limpet case is ours, you get an uncle in Switzerland who has suffered an untimely death... a rich uncle.
I'm going to pretend I didn't hear that.
- You're in over your head, Rex.
- It's...
Don't answer now... but think about it.
Enjoy the rabbit.
- Morning.
- Hi.
- Are you not swimming?
- I'm not in the mood.
I like you, Thomas.
You see everything and say nothing.
- SHE SOBS
- My husband is screwing our nanny.
What a cliche.
Jed said I should have hired an uglier girl,
- but the agency only had stunners.
- [SHE SNIFFLES]
Could you do my back?
Don't worry, I don't want to sleep with you.
- Why is he keeping you here?
- I don't know.
Grooming you, is he?
For what?
You just be careful.
Roper's planning a big arms deal to Apo's Lebanese friend.
Weapons from seven British and American companies, weapons no-one should be trading in.
Roper's using a company called TradePass to fence the deal.
He pretends it trades in agricultural equipment and his investors pretend to believe him.
You can stop rubbing now.
Why are you telling me this?
I just want to be honest with someone in this world.
Does Jed know?
No, of course not!
Sandy screws everyone and tells me everything.
Roper is steadfastly faithful and tells Jed nothing.
Do you think I should tell her?
Maybe.
[HE GRUNTS]
If it's worry for your boy, forget it.
He knew what he was getting into.
Did he?
So, you and Mr Burr, are you making a go of it?
Well, you know, like my mum says, "You make your bed, you die in it."
No, Gordon's a decent man.
It's not his fault I'm not in love with him.
Listen...
Oh, Joel, let's not have that conversation, please?
Well, you can't deny the past.
- Past is all it is.
- It doesn't have to be.
[SHE SIGHS]
Joel...
You silly sod.
[JOEL CHUCKLES]
[BIRDS TWITTER]
Hi, Corky.
Frisky.
Hey, Danny.
Thomas, have you seen my phone?
I haven't.
Sorry.
Dad'll be cross.
Everyone's cross and Jed's not talking to Dad.
What's going on?
I don't know.
I'll tell you what, why don't I come downstairs and read you a bedtime story,
- and we can look for your phone in the morning?
- OK.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
What should we read?
I don't know.
Which one's your favourite?
Three Little Pigs.
OK, the pigs?
I can give you the Thomas version:
Two Little Pigs.
[HE EXHALES]
- [COMPUTER BEEPS]
- What's that?
- That right there.
Punch that up.
Punch that up.
- What is it?
It's your boy.
"Seven tractor firms", seven armament manufacturers?
"Home sale with best friend", that's the UK and the US.
"Buyer in Beirut via Worst Man".
Well, Worst Man is Roper, Roper's the middleman?
- What's TradePass?
- I'm not sure, must be a front organisation.
What I do know, though, is Roper's pressed the green light.
All right.
OK.
Hey, guys...
OK, so, just put the cases by the taxi and then you can jump in.
Good girl.
Pop in.
Jump in.
OK, put your seatbelts on, guys.
[CARO CRIES SOFTLY]
OK...
- OK.
Here we go.
- [ENGINE RUMBLES]
[WOMAN SOBS]
Get in the taxi, you bloody whore!
- Caroline, for...
- You bitch!
Caroline, for Christ's sake, she's going.
She's going.
She's go...
Caro...
Bitch!
Whore!
- Caroline.
- Just shut up!
- All right.
Just shut up, Sandy, you shit!
What, you like the show?
You like the show, Dicky?
Dicky Roper?
[CAR ENGINE REVS]
See you later, guys.
Jed, darling...
Don't even.
Where is everybody?
- Monaco.
- Huh.
- Two days of meetings.
Things are ramping up.
And you're not...
- You're not going too?
- Not me, no.
The girl was supposed to go but she's blown him out.
I'm staying with her.
We're going riding instead.
Didn't she invite you?
- Oh, dear.
- [PINE CHUCKLES]
Very good.
Well, have a nice time.

[ALARM STOPS] [HE EXHALES]
JED:
I'll just be a minute.
What are you doing in here?
I brought you some flowers.
Why didn't you give them to the maids?
- I have to change.
- Close the door.
You can't be in here.
This is our bedroom.
What is that?
I found it on the desktop.
You broke into his office and you spied on his papers.
You have to be more careful.
CORKY:
Darling, Angel, Sweetie, everyone's starving...
- He can't see you.
- Get rid of him.
Are you decent?
- What's going on?
- Nothing.
I'm coming.
How was your trip?
Noisy.
I hitched a ride on a C-130.
Oh, fun.
How was yours?
Fine, thank you.
I'm not sure why we had to make it.
Is there a reason we're doing this in person?
Well, Halo is not too keen on intermediaries just now.
And yet he's sent you?
There's an enforcement operation called Limpet.
We have to keep our eyes on it.
Halo says you need to be careful.
I am always careful.
How far have they got?
They've drawn a line between Langbourne and Apostol.
- Jesus.
- How did they manage that?
A photograph of a meeting.
Are they after buyers or sellers?
We don't know.
We assume both.
You can assure Halo that we have taken every precaution.
We have received intelligence of our own.
We are changing the guard.
Good.
JED:
'How was your meeting?
'
It was fine.
It was fine?
Don't be so bloody childish!
Look, Caro was upset.
She wanted to get back at Sandy so she started spreading manure.
That's it.
End of story.
That's what it is, it's just a story?
Jesus, Jed, what the hell is the matter with you?
Tell me why I should believe you.
Why shouldn't you believe me?
When have I ever lied to you?
Oh, you... you don't lie to me.
You're much too clever for that.
You just hide.
What?
What do I hide?
The truth, Roper!
Well, what about your truth?
What about the things you hide from me?
I don't hide anything from you.
You have a child, Jed!
You have a son.
Let's start with him.
Or don't you think he counts?
- How do you know?
- We're not talking how, we're talking why.
Why would you hide that from me?
That was not included in the brochure.
Screw your brochure, Roper.
You don't own me.
No-one is entitled to know things about me that I don't want them to know.
Oh, but you're entitled to spy on my life?
I can read a bloody bank statement.
I'm paying money to raise another man's kid.
I know that and now anyone listening to this phone call knows it too.
Apart from that, how was your day?
[PHONE BEEPS]
[COMPUTER BEEPS]
- [PEN CLATTERS TO FLOOR]
- On your feet, soldier.
[HE GRUNTS]
Where the hell did he get that?
- "Halo".
- Yeah.
[BIRDS TWITTER]
They're back?
Apparently so.
The chief wants to see you.
Not you, him.
Present for you on the table.
Thank you.
I told them to put some visas in it and make it look scruffy.
Never trust a new passport, in my view.
Always go with the old 'uns - like Third World taxi drivers, there's a reason they have survived.
"Andrew Birch"?
We like the tree thing.
We thought we'd stick with that.
It's all official.
You are reborn.
The visas are real.
If you want to renew, go to the consulate abroad, less risky.
[PASSPORT CLATTERS TO GROUND]
- What's up?
- Erm, I thought that was my present.
Well, it can be, if you do something for me.
Right.
Sandy, papers.
Mm-hmm.
We're going to need a witness... preferably Spanish so they can't actually read the bloody thing.
I'll get Carlos.
- Is he 18?
- Yeah.
Wait, what is this?
What am I signing?
Jesus, Pine, for a murderer on the run, you're pretty bloody picky.
I am giving you your own company.
Erm...
Look, I...
Look, I really...
I don't know anything about running a company.
You don't have to.
All you have to do is sign as Andrew Birch.
Why don't you practise a few signatures?
Get the feel of it.
[HE CLEARS HIS THROAT]
Andrew Birch.
B-I-R,
C for Charlie,
H for Hotel.
Go on.
Manly one.
Go for a manly one.
Andrew Birch in a hurry.
- [ROPER GROWLS]
- Andrew Birch.
One more.
That's more like it.
[DOOR OPENS]
Carlos, ven aqui.
Necesito que firmes esto.
There and there and one more there.
Carlos, here, right at the bottom.
Good lad.
[DOOR OPENS]
[DOOR CLOSES]
Welcome to the family, Andrew.
- ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ - _
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪
♪ Happy birthday, dear Elena ♪
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪
My darling daughter!
The most beautiful girl in the world!
- A marvellous necklace from Paris!
- Ooh!
The most expensive necklace!
_
Enjoy the party!
Thank you.
What about austerity, Apo?
This is austerity.
You should have seen our country five years ago.
- Tomorrow's business...
- Uh-huh?
By the way, my Arab friend is concerned you can't deliver the merchandise you promised.
I wouldn't worry about that, Apo, it'll be fine.
I hope so.
- Ah, Mr Barghati.
- Sandy.
How good to see you.
Oh, my goodness!
Oh, Lord!
Oh, Lord!
What's happening here?
Qué pasa?
Qué pasa?
Qué pasa?
- Jesus!
- Help her!
Help me, please!
Elena!
Elena!
Elena!
Elena!
Elena!
She must've been in so much pain.
Yeah, well, she's caused a lot of other people pain, too.
We had to reschedule that meeting.
Still, the canapes were good.
What do you want to do about our Arab chum?
Bring him out to the villa?
I don't much like that, it's too risky if someone's got a watch on him.
Invite him to the children's party.
There'll be lots of people there, you can do your magic tricks.
Try and get them right.
- Fix it up, will you?
- OK.
Sorry, darling, I don't know what I was thinking, it was a crass thing to say.
_
OK... let's go, dream boy.
Huh!
Come on.
Go left.
Up the stairs.
So the silly sod is insisting on 10% and he is digging his heels in.
All right, we'll let him enjoy that for a week, and then we'll take it away from him.
Yeah, that's fine.
I'm happy to go with that.
Ah, there he is.
Dans, you're on.
Thank you very much, sir, for rescuing me.
I hope you're feeling better.
You're very welcome.
All right, now scram.
See if you can catch us some mackerel for supper.
And take the dogs, will you?
Go on, Shirley.
Go on, you foul-smelling creature.
You'll call him, will you?
Yep.
Leave it with me, I'll deal with it.
Don't waste any energy trying to sweet-talk him,
- just lay it out, let him sweat.
- All right.
All right, Frisky, no more interruptions, no-one on the terrace.
- What the hell is that noise?
- Oh, Javier is blowing leaves.
Well, tell him to knock it off, will you?
Cease and desist.
How's the face?
- It's fine.
- We'll be all right.
- So, what do you want?
- I'd like to... to go back to the restaurant, if that's all right.
That's not what I meant.
What do you want... from the world?
I don't know.
I haven't got a plan.
I'm taking some time out.
Don't believe you.
You've never relaxed in your life.
If you say so.
Just sit down.
Everyone assumes that I was born with a silver spoon in my mouth.
It's balls.
My father was an Oxfordshire auctioneer, taught me the price of everything, but the drive to create all of this, that comes from me and me alone.
Where does it come from in you?
I'm not sure I have what you describe.
OK, you patched me up, I'm very grateful for that, and now I'd like to go.
Corky can't make you out, you see.
Suspicious chap, Corks.
He's got bad vibes about you.
Why did you kill that fellow in Devon?
It's all over the wire.
We had to call the police, no choice.
They'll be here any minute.
You are a cool cucumber, aren't you?
He cheated me.
And you didn't like that?
- No, I didn't.
- Quite right.
The MacArthurs have confirmed for dinner, so... that makes 12 tonight.
Or 13.
Come and tell us why you think this one's a bad apple, Corky?
Well, his references aren't too clever.
Luckily for you, old Jorge was so desperate for a sous chef, he didn't bother to check them.
You faked them, Pine?
I needed the job.
I needed it fast, I didn't have time for formalities.
Where'd you get the passport?
I met a girl... in Devon.
Didn't we all.
Pretty little thing.
Who's Quince?
Her ex.
He'd never been abroad, he'd never had a passport, so I took his name.
You've taken a lot of names, haven't you?
It makes a man wonder who you really are.
So, father killed in Belfast, no close relationship with mother, married once for six months, we can assume not a triumph.
Two tours in Iraq, distinguished service.
And on return, what?
Despair, depression, and then five years as a night owl in the hotel business.
What was that?
Hibernation?
Burying yourself alive?
And then a sudden moment of madness.
Thieving, narcotics... murder.
This is bloody chaos, Jonathan.
Do you even know who you are?
Those two chaps you smashed up in the restaurant, did you know them?
No.
They hadn't eaten there before?
Did they look like they'd eaten there before?
- Ever sailed a boat for them?
- Is this some kind of interrogation?
Let's pretend it is.
Did you cook for them?
No.
The mussels were marvellous, by the way.
So you weren't the lookout guy?
- You didn't switch roles halfway through?
- No.
That's another one of Corky's little theories.
Listen, I haven't asked for anything, all right?
I don't expect a reward,
I certainly don't appreciate this investigation into my personal life.
And, frankly, I'm bored of your hospitality.
Maybe I'm not squeaky-clean, but nor, I suspect, are you and your little friend here, so maybe we just leave it at that.
- Little friend!
- I know!
Charmant!
- Where are you going?
- I'm leaving.
What are you going to do for a passport?
I have a passport in the name of Thomas Quince.
Where is it?
Corky, sock him the bad news.
The passport's gone, old love.
Thomas Quince had to be shredded.
- What are you talking about?
- It's no good getting in a panic, my dear.
Your cover's blown sky-high.
Tom Quince is on every wanted list on God's earth.
Murder, theft, sadly not buggery, but we'll work on that.
That was my passport.
That was mine!
Well, you're going to have to learn to be someone else, aren't you?
I said no-one in here!
Sorry, baby, I didn't know.
Jesus!
Sorry, my darling, I didn't know it was you.
It's actually good news.
Thomas is going to be staying for a while,
- till he's fighting fit again.
- Oh.
That's great.
You want to come for a swim?
Go on.
Corky can lend you some Speedos.
I'd like to.
Corky, why don't you put him in the fisherman's cottage at the end of the estate...
- while we work out what to do with you.
- All right, boss.
And what am I supposed to do until then?
Well, you can keep Dans company.
We were supposed to have a school friend here for the holiday, but the bugger stood him up.
His mother doesn't approve of me.
One more thing...
I run a tight ship here.
You're right, we do a little swashbuckling every now and then, but we play straight with each other.
Now, you saved my boy and I'm grateful, but if you step out of line... we'll make you howl for your mother.
What size feet have you got?
- 12.
- Hmm.
Now, house rules.
No phones, no postcards to Devon dumplings.
No messages in a bottle.
The chief values privacy... as do we all.
All the way down to the beach, as far as you can go, and it's on the right.
Alternatively, fill your pockets with stones, walk into the sea... and keep going.
Anything?
No.
Bloody hell!
I hate this bit.
_
Off every tree you may freely eat... maids, serving wenches, cooks, typists, masseuses, even the lady who comes to clip the canary's claws.
But if you lay one hand on that precious fruit, then like the Belgians in the Congo, we'll chop it off.
And I don't mean the hand.
Senor Roper.
Morning.
I was wondering if I might take Danny into town?
What for?
A change.
- He likes you, doesn't he?
- I hope so.
I like him.
Frisky and Tabby will go with you.
Pine thank you.
It's me.
They're on the move.
Do you always have this much company, Danny?
Since the restaurant.
- It's a bit boring, isn't it?
- Yeah.
Oi!
It's OK.
It's all right.
- Danny?
- Yeah.
What do you say... to an ice cream?
- Yeah?
Great.
- Yeah.
Actually why don't you ask Frisky and Tabby if they want an ice cream as well, huh?
OK.
- Would you like an ice cream?
- No.
- Really?
Would you?
- No.
They didn't want one.
- They don't want one?
- No.
They are very strange, aren't they, those two?
Yeah, especially on a day like this, who wouldn't want an ice cream?
!
What's your favourite flavour, Danny?
- Pistachio.
- Dos pistachios, por favor.
Para mi.
- Danny?
- Yeah?
Do you know who's... coming to the party on Sunday?
It's a select group, around 25.
Senior, por favor...
Sorry, I need to hear the complete list, all the names of all your ice creams.
Oh, gracias.
Sorry.
That's all right.
I think Sandy and Caroline will probably be there, won't they?
I don't know who's coming.
You see, I've got this problem, it's Major Corcoran.
I don't think he likes me very much.
- Why not?
- I don't know.
But he's trying to find out everything he can about me.
All the way back to the time of the ancient Egyptians.
Mmm.
Muchos gracias.
Right, waiting's over.
- We've got a spot of work to do,
- All right, come on.
thank God.
- So, how often do you come here?
- Only in the summer.
It must be nice to see Dad, though?
Do you play tennis with him?
I have lessons with Lewis.
- Roper's not here much.
- Well, I expect he works hard, eh?
- That's why he has such a big house.
- I bet you've counted the rooms.
23.
There's three kitchens and a big office by the pool.
And there's Roper's secret study in his bedroom, but no-one's allowed in there.
- Except you?
Special guest?
- I'm not.
He calls it The Citadel.
And there's one key... and he hides it.
Do you know what's inside?
He says it's full of peppermints.
Well, I'd lock it up too if I were him.
Plus, there's an alarm.
They test it every day at 11.
You have to be really careful.
Why?
This is where I cut my foot last year.
Roper made me stand in the sea for about half an hour, because of the salt.
_
Ever since his daughter killed herself, he comes here every day.
And that's not all.
Yesterday afternoon, he calls the hotline of the Madrid Public Prosecutor's Office, says he has information regarding a world-class illegal arms deal.
Operator asks his name, he hangs up.
Assumption, a priest's advice only goes so far.
- Gracias, padre.
- Gracias.
Mr Apostol?
Who are you?
I'm your guardian angel, Mr Apostol.
I can't sleep.
Every night...
I ask myself the same question.
What I could have done?
Now you're having a child you can understand how I feel.
I can, Juan.
When you called the Madrid office, you had blood on your hands.
And I'm here to wash it off.
How?
- You know Richard Roper?
- Yes.
- He's a friend.
- Juan, he's not a friend.
He dragged you down and he dragged your daughter down too.
If Roper wasn't in your life, I think she'd still be alive today.
Sorry.
Now, God knows how you bear it, I...
I don't think I could.
Listen, I'm on the side of the angels.
We're good people, we play it straight and we keep our promises.
OK?
But I need your help.
Do you know Lance Corcoran?
Yes.
He's Dicky Roper's right-hand man.
Right, well, that's what needs to change.
Are you pink?
Socialist, left-wing, march of history, that sort of thing?
It wouldn't bother me if you were, it's another one of Corky's bugbears.
He seems to have a few.
Yeah.
Been in a lot of foxholes, me and Corky.
Once spent a week together in a police cell in Delhi.
I don't think I've ever laughed so much in my whole life.
Was he drinking then?
Well, now, that is a deeply odd thing to say.
What business is it of yours how much he drinks?
When my father was serving in Belfast a sergeant in his platoon got drunk one night, told a local girl what the next day's operation was.
The man I loved most in the world was dead for five pints of lager and the promise of a quickie.
Right, so you don't drink and you're not pink, what are you?
Me, I'm a free man.
Free to think, free to work, free to climb a mountain or lie in bed all day eating peppermint creams without any bugger telling me how.
Then I'm a free man.
Oh, that's the free part, the man part's a little different.
See, children grow up thinking the adult world is ordered, rational, fit for purpose.
It's crap.
Becoming a man is realising... that it's all rotten.
Realising how to celebrate that rottenness, that's freedom.
Here we are.
Out we go.
Come on.
Chop chop.
Let's go.
Mademoiselle.
- Merci, monsieur.
- OK.
Senor?
The bags, please.
Thank you so much.
Thank you so much for coming.
Have a wonderful day.
Caro, divine as ever.
- Sandy, sort of acceptable.
- There you go.
Apo, my dear old friend.
- I'm so terribly sorry for your loss.
- Thanks.
How are you?
I can't even imagine.
Mr Barghati, thank you so much for coming.
Please come inside.
Let's see if we can feed and sustain you before we get down to business.
And did you get the sweater?
Great.
Does it fit?
Mmm.
Uh-huh.
OK.
Love you.
Bye, honey.
I'm so sorry to interrupt.
The guests are arriving and the party's going to start soon.
The story begins in Egypt 4,500 years ago.
The ancient Egyptians invented this game.
It is literally the oldest trick in the book.
Now, you start with a ball.
We have one, two, three cups.
You lay one cup like that, one cup like that, one cup like that...
All right?
Now, I'm going to take the ball and I'm going to place the ball in the cup.
Shake the cup.
Turn it over.
All right, now, you have to watch very closely.
You have to watch the cups.
I'm going to move these two round like that.
This one round like that.
Everybody clear on where the ball is now?
Danny, where's the ball?
You think the ball's here?
No, Danny, the ball's in the middle!
You're not watching the cups, Danny.
Thomas is watching the cups, aren't you, Thomas?
You're a gym bunny, aren't you?
Aren't you?
A little cold gym bunny...
He can't stop his mouth... in every way.
Corky can get a little overexcited when he's drunk.
Yes, that is what Mr Barghati is worried about.
That little smile...
According to our friend, he has been shooting his mouth off... talking about things he should not.
Barghati doesn't want him involved... condition of the deal.
- Thanks for that, Apo.
- Spit.
Yeah!
Come...
Come with me...
And it's a funny thing, isn't it?
If you want to piss...
I am so sorry to interrupt, but can I just borrow the old man for a second?
- Oh, of course.
- Thank you.
- Excuse me.
- Bye.
Bye.
I have just spoken to Apo, and he has a...
There you go, Danny.
Thomas.
For God's sake...
Roper,
Thomas and I are going to go for a little stroll.
All right, darling.
Frisky, Major Corkoran is here with some friends of Dorothy that I would like to have escorted from the premises.
You and Tabby can make as much noise as you like.
All right?
- A pleasure.
- Tabbs.
If you need to relieve yourself, it's good to do it into a suitable perspective.
It's better than a urinal, isn't it?
- God's urinal, I call this.
- You've got to break it up.
You're giving the boss indigestion with your buddies here.
- Come on, lads.
The party's over.
- Frisky, go pee-pee.
Leave your drinks here.
Frisky, don't be too rough.
Who are all these people?
How should I know?
You're not curious?
Why should I be?
- It's business.
- Which is what?
Buying and selling agricultural equipment.
Caro says Sandy tells her everything.
That would drive me insane.
You shouldn't have seen me like that today, in my bedroom.
I'm sorry.
The door was open.
I thought you were dressed.
That's not what I meant.
I don't care who sees me naked.
I do care who sees me crying.
You tell no-one you saw that, is that clear?
Of course.
I'm going swimming.
- Want to come?
- Ah...
I don't think that would be wise.
There's no current.
That's not quite what I meant.
I know it wasn't.
There she goes, beyond the ha-ha!
One day, Thomas, you'll live a little.
_
Erm, come...
Rex, do you have a minute?
The Permanent Secretary would love to see you.
Erm, yes.
- Is that a yes or a no?
- Mm-hmm.
Rex, come in.
- You know Geoffrey Dromgoole, of course,
- Geoffrey.
- and his team from the River.
- Rex.
Barbara Vandon from the American Embassy.
Rex Mayhew, my undersecretary.
- Good to see you, Rex.
- Barbara, how are you?
Rex, it's this Limpet thing.
Limpet?
The Joel Steadman enforcement operation with Angela Burr on side-saddle.
Yes, I know what Limpet is...
it's an enforcement case.
It's nothing to do with Langley... or River House.
Well, it's what Barbara feels we ought to be discussing.
Rex, Langley has been completely railroaded on this.
Currently, we have a joint operation on foreign soil between two extremely fringe outfits.
They're chasing international arms in an area of the world that is... way beyond their comprehension.
It's crazy.
I have to say, I agree.
You know, Limpet is operating in a highly incendiary region, and I would hate to see that run out of control.
In my view, it should be placed under a purely intelligence jurisdiction, acting on a political brief, but, it's not my decision.
No, it's not.
I'm sure I don't need to remind you or your team that my recommendation, accepted by the Permanent Secretary, was that River House was overextended, and that enforcement agencies were urgently needed to prosecute any areas of international criminal activity that were,
for whatever reason, slipping through the intelligence net.
In that context, I find the actions of River House somewhat inimical to the new era of parliamentary accountability and transparency.
Does that answer your question?
- Why don't we leave it there for today?
- Thank you.
Have you got a moment?
Not much more than that...
Celia's cooking rabbit.
That's all it will take.
Good job in there.
You pressed all the right buttons...
accountability, transparency...
I don't like being bullied, never have.
You see, the thing is, I'm not sure that Limpet's quite the abject failure that Angela Burr would have us believe.
Really?
So, the day that the Limpet case is ours, you get an uncle in Switzerland who has suffered an untimely death... a rich uncle.
I'm going to pretend I didn't hear that.
You're in over your head, Rex.
- It's...
- Don't answer now... but think about it.
Enjoy the rabbit.
- Morning.
- Hi.
- Are you not swimming?
- I'm not in the mood.
I like you, Thomas...
You see everything and say nothing.
My husband is screwing our nanny.
What a cliché.
Jed said I should have hired an uglier girl but the agency only had stunners.
Could you do my back?
Don't worry, I don't want to sleep with you.
- Why is he keeping you here?
- I don't know.
Grooming you, is he?
For what?
You just be careful.
Roper's planning a big arms deal to Apo's Lebanese friend.
Weapons from seven British and American companies... weapons no-one should be trading in.
Roper's using a company called TradePass to fence the deal.
He pretends it trades in agricultural equipment and his investors pretend to believe him.
You can stop rubbing now.
Why are you telling me this?
I just want to be honest with someone in this world.
Does Jed know?
No, of course not!
Sandy screws everyone and tells me everything.
Roper is steadfastly faithful and tells Jed nothing.
Do you think I should tell her?
Maybe.
If it's worry for your boy, forget it.
He knew what he was getting into.
Did he?
So, you and Mr Burr, are you making a go of it?
Well, you know, like my mum says, "You make your bed... you die in it."
No, Gordon's a decent man.
It's not his fault I'm not in love with him.
Listen...
Oh, Joel, let's not have that conversation, please?
Well, you can't deny the past.
- Past is all it is.
- It doesn't have to be.
Joel...
You silly sod.
Hi, Corky.
Frisky.
Hey, Danny.
Thomas, have you seen my phone?
I haven't.
Sorry.
Dad'll be cross.
Everyone's cross and Jed's not talking to Dad.
What's going on?
I don't know.
I'll tell you what, why don't I come downstairs and read you a bedtime story, and we can look for your phone in the morning?
OK.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
What should we read?
I don't know.
Which one's your favourite?
Three Little Pigs.
OK, the pigs?
I can give you the Thomas version...
Two Little Pigs.
No.
What's that?
That right there.
Punch that up.
Punch that up.
What is it?
It's your boy.
"Seven tractor firms"...
seven armament manufacturers?
"Home sale with best friend", that's the UK and the US.
"Buyer in Beirut via Worst Man".
Well, Worst Man is Roper.
Roper's the middleman?
- What's TradePass?
- I'm not sure, must be a front organisation.
What I do know, though, is Roper's pressed the green light.
All right.
OK.
Hey, guys...
OK, so, just put the cases by the taxi and then you can jump in.
Good girl.
Pop in.
Jump in.
OK, put your seatbelts on, guys.
OK...
OK.
Here we go.
Get in the taxi, you bloody whore!
- Caroline, for...
- You bitch!
Caroline, for Christ's sake, she's going.
She's going.
She's go...
- Caro...
- Bitch!
- Whore!
- Caroline.
- Just shut up!
- All right.
Just shut up, Sandy, you shit!
What, you like the show?
You like the show, Dicky?
Dicky Roper?
See you later, guys.
Jed, darling...
Don't even.
Where is everybody?
- Monaco.
- Huh.
Two days of meetings.
Things are ramping up.
And you're not...
- You're not going too?
- Not me, no.
The girl was supposed to go but she's blown him out.
I'm staying with her.
We're going riding instead.
Didn't she invite you?
Oh, dear.
Very good.
Well, have a nice time.
I'll just be a minute.
What are you doing in here?
I brought you some flowers.
Why didn't you give them to the maids?
- I have to change.
- Close the door.
You can't be in here.
This is our bedroom.
What is that?
I found it on the desktop.
You broke into his office and you spied on his papers.
You have to be more careful.
Darling, Angel, Sweetie, everyone's starving...
- He can't see you.
- Get rid of him.
Are you decent?
- What's going on?
- Nothing.
I'm coming.
_
How was your trip?
Noisy.
I hitched a ride on a C-130.
- Oh, fun.
- How was yours?
Fine, thank you.
I'm not sure why we had to make it.
Is there a reason we're doing this in person?
Well, Halo is not too keen on intermediaries just now.
And yet he's sent you?
There's an enforcement operation called Limpet.
We have to keep our eyes on it.
Halo says you need to be careful.
I am always careful.
How far have they got?
They've drawn a line between Langbourne and Apostol.
- Jesus.
- How did they manage that?
A photograph of a meeting.
Are they after buyers or sellers?
We don't know.
We assume both.
You can assure Halo that we have taken every precaution.
We have received intelligence of our own.
We are changing the guard.
Good.
How was your meeting?
It was fine.
It was fine?
Don't be so bloody childish!
Look, Caro was upset.
She wanted to get back at Sandy so she started spreading manure.
That's it.
End of story.
That's what it is... it's just a story?
Jesus, Jed, what the hell is the matter with you?
Tell me why I should believe you.
Why shouldn't you believe me?
- When have I ever lied to you?
- Oh, you... you don't lie to me.
You're much too clever for that.
You just hide.
- What?
What do I hide?
- The truth, Roper!
Well, what about your truth?
What about the things you hide from me?
I don't hide anything from you.
You have a child, Jed!
You have a son.
Let's start with him.
Or don't you think he counts?
How do you know that?
We're not talking how, we're talking why.
Why would you hide that from me?
That was not included in the brochure.
Screw your brochure, Roper.
You don't own me.
No-one is entitled to know things about me that I don't want them to know.
Oh, but you're entitled to spy on my life?
I can read a bloody bank statement.
I'm paying money to raise another man's kid.
I know that and now anyone listening to this phone call knows it too.
Apart from that, how was your day?
_
On your feet, soldier.
Where the hell did he get that?
- "Halo".
- Yeah.
They're back?
Apparently so.
The chief wants to see you.
Not you, him.
Present for you on the table.
Thank you.
I told them to put some visas in it and make it look scruffy.
Never trust a new passport, in my view.
Always go with the old 'uns... like Third World taxi drivers, there's a reason they have survived.
"Andrew Birch"?
We like the tree thing, we thought we'd stick with that.
It's all official.
You are reborn.
The visas are real.
If you want to renew, go to the consulate abroad...
less risky.
- What's up?
- Erm, I thought that was my present.
Well, it can be, if you do something for me.
Right.
Sandy, papers.
Mm-hmm.
We're going to need a witness... preferably Spanish so they can't actually read the bloody thing.
I'll get Carlos.
- Is he 18?
- Yeah.
Wait, what is this?
What am I signing?
Jesus, Pine, for a murderer on the run, you're pretty bloody picky.
I am giving you your own company.
Erm...
Look, I...
Look, I really...
I don't know anything about running a company.
You don't have to.
All you have to do is sign as Andrew Birch.
Why don't you practise a few signatures?
Get the feel of it.
Andrew Birch.
B-I-R,
C for Charlie,
H for Hotel.
Go on.
Manly one.
Go for a manly one.
Andrew Birch in a hurry.
Andrew Birch.
One more.
That's more like it.
Carlos, ven aqui.
- Necesito que firmes esto.
- _
_
_
There and there and one more there.
Carlos, here, right at the bottom.
Good lad.
Welcome to the family, Andrew.
My darling daughter!
The most beautiful girl in the world!
- A marvellous necklace from Paris!
- Ooh!
The most expensive necklace!
_
Enjoy the party!
Thank you.
What about austerity, Apo?
This is austerity.
You should have seen our country five years ago.
- Tomorrow's business...
- Uh-huh?
By the way, my Arab friend is concerned you can't deliver the merchandise you promised.
I wouldn't worry about that, Apo, it'll be fine.
I hope so.
- Ah, Mr Barghati.
- Sandy.
How good to see you.
Oh, my goodness!
Oh, Lord!
Oh, Lord!
What's happening here?
Qué pasa?
Qué pasa?
Qué pasa?
- Jesus!
- Help her!
Help me, please!
Elena!
Elena!
Elena!
Elena!
Elena!
She must've been in so much pain.
Yeah, well, she's caused a lot of other people pain, too.
We had to reschedule that meeting.
Still, the canapes were good.
What do you want to do about our Arab chum?
Bring him out to the villa?
I don't much like that, it's too risky if someone's got a watch on him.
Invite him to the children's party.
There'll be lots of people there, you can do your magic tricks.
Try and get them right.
- Fix it up, will you?
- OK.
Sorry, darling, I don't know what I was thinking, it was a crass thing to say.
_
OK... let's go, dream boy.
Huh!
Come on.
Go left.
Up the stairs.
So the silly sod is insisting on 10% and he is digging his heels in.
All right, we'll let him enjoy that for a week, and then we'll take it away from him.
Yeah, that's fine.
I'm happy to go with that.
Ah, there he is.
Dans, you're on.
Thank you very much, sir, for rescuing me.
I hope you're feeling better.
You're very welcome.
All right, now scram.
See if you can catch us some mackerel for supper.
And take the dogs, will you?
Go on, Shirley.
Go on, you foul-smelling creature.
You'll call him, will you?
Yep.
Leave it with me, I'll deal with it.
Don't waste any energy trying to sweet-talk him,
- just lay it out, let him sweat.
- All right.
All right, Frisky, no more interruptions, no-one on the terrace.
- What the hell is that noise?
- Oh, Javier is blowing leaves.
Well, tell him to knock it off, will you?
Cease and desist.
How's the face?
- It's fine.
- We'll be all right.
- So, what do you want?
- I'd like to... to go back to the restaurant, if that's all right.
That's not what I meant.
What do you want... from the world?
I don't know.
I haven't got a plan.
I'm taking some time out.
Don't believe you.
You've never relaxed in your life.
If you say so.
Just sit down.
Everyone assumes that I was born with a silver spoon in my mouth.
It's balls.
My father was an Oxfordshire auctioneer, taught me the price of everything, but the drive to create all of this, that comes from me and me alone.
Where does it come from in you?
I'm not sure I have what you describe.
OK, you patched me up, I'm very grateful for that, and now I'd like to go.
Corky can't make you out, you see.
Suspicious chap, Corks.
He's got bad vibes about you.
Why did you kill that fellow in Devon?
It's all over the wire.
We had to call the police, no choice.
They'll be here any minute.
You are a cool cucumber, aren't you?
He cheated me.
And you didn't like that?
- No, I didn't.
- Quite right.
The MacArthurs have confirmed for dinner, so... that makes 12 tonight.
Or 13.
Come and tell us why you think this one's a bad apple, Corky?
Well, his references aren't too clever.
Luckily for you, old Jorge was so desperate for a sous chef, he didn't bother to check them.
You faked them, Pine?
I needed the job.
I needed it fast, I didn't have time for formalities.
Where'd you get the passport?
I met a girl... in Devon.
Didn't we all.
Pretty little thing.
Who's Quince?
Her ex.
He'd never been abroad, he'd never had a passport, so I took his name.
You've taken a lot of names, haven't you?
It makes a man wonder who you really are.
So, father killed in Belfast, no close relationship with mother, married once for six months, we can assume not a triumph.
Two tours in Iraq, distinguished service.
And on return, what?
Despair, depression, and then five years as a night owl in the hotel business.
What was that?
Hibernation?
Burying yourself alive?
And then a sudden moment of madness.
Thieving, narcotics... murder.
This is bloody chaos, Jonathan.
Do you even know who you are?
Those two chaps you smashed up in the restaurant, did you know them?
No.
They hadn't eaten there before?
Did they look like they'd eaten there before?
- Ever sailed a boat for them?
- Is this some kind of interrogation?
Let's pretend it is.
Did you cook for them?
No.
The mussels were marvellous, by the way.
So you weren't the lookout guy?
- You didn't switch roles halfway through?
- No.
That's another one of Corky's little theories.
Listen, I haven't asked for anything, all right?
I don't expect a reward,
I certainly don't appreciate this investigation into my personal life.
And, frankly, I'm bored of your hospitality.
Maybe I'm not squeaky-clean, but nor, I suspect, are you and your little friend here, so maybe we just leave it at that.
- Little friend!
- I know!
Charmant!
- Where are you going?
- I'm leaving.
What are you going to do for a passport?
I have a passport in the name of Thomas Quince.
Where is it?
Corky, sock him the bad news.
The passport's gone, old love.
Thomas Quince had to be shredded.
- What are you talking about?
- It's no good getting in a panic, my dear.
Your cover's blown sky-high.
Tom Quince is on every wanted list on God's earth.
Murder, theft, sadly not buggery, but we'll work on that.
That was my passport.
That was mine!
Well, you're going to have to learn to be someone else, aren't you?
I said no-one in here!
Sorry, baby, I didn't know.
Jesus!
Sorry, my darling, I didn't know it was you.
It's actually good news.
Thomas is going to be staying for a while,
- till he's fighting fit again.
- Oh.
That's great.
You want to come for a swim?
Go on.
Corky can lend you some Speedos.
I'd like to.
Corky, why don't you put him in the fisherman's cottage at the end of the estate...
- while we work out what to do with you.
- All right, boss.
And what am I supposed to do until then?
Well, you can keep Dans company.
We were supposed to have a school friend here for the holiday, but the bugger stood him up.
His mother doesn't approve of me.
One more thing...
I run a tight ship here.
You're right, we do a little swashbuckling every now and then, but we play straight with each other.
Now, you saved my boy and I'm grateful, but if you step out of line... we'll make you howl for your mother.
What size feet have you got?
- 12.
- Hmm.
Now, house rules.
No phones, no postcards to Devon dumplings.
No messages in a bottle.
The chief values privacy... as do we all.
All the way down to the beach, as far as you can go, and it's on the right.
Alternatively, fill your pockets with stones, walk into the sea... and keep going.
Anything?
No.
Bloody hell!
I hate this bit.
_
Off every tree you may freely eat... maids, serving wenches, cooks, typists, masseuses, even the lady who comes to clip the canary's claws.
But if you lay one hand on that precious fruit, then like the Belgians in the Congo, we'll chop it off.
And I don't mean the hand.
Senor Roper.
Morning.
I was wondering if I might take Danny into town?
What for?
A change.
- He likes you, doesn't he?
- I hope so.
I like him.
Frisky and Tabby will go with you.
Pine thank you.
It's me.
They're on the move.
Do you always have this much company, Danny?
Since the restaurant.
- It's a bit boring, isn't it?
- Yeah.
Oi!
It's OK.
It's all right.
- Danny?
- Yeah.
What do you say... to an ice cream?
- Yeah?
Great.
- Yeah.
Actually why don't you ask Frisky and Tabby if they want an ice cream as well, huh?
OK.
- Would you like an ice cream?
- No.
- Really?
Would you?
- No.
They didn't want one.
- They don't want one?
- No.
They are very strange, aren't they, those two?
Yeah, especially on a day like this, who wouldn't want an ice cream?
!
What's your favourite flavour, Danny?
- Pistachio.
- Dos pistachios, por favor.
Aahora mismo.
- Danny?
- Yeah?
Do you know who's... coming to the party on Sunday?
It's a select group, around 25.
Senior, por favor...
Sorry, I need to hear the complete list, all the names of all your ice creams.
Oh, gracias.
Sorry.
That's all right.
I think Sandy and Caroline will probably be there, won't they?
I don't know who's coming.
You see, I've got this problem, it's Major Corcoran.
I don't think he likes me very much.
- Why not?
- I don't know.
But he's trying to find out everything he can about me.
All the way back to the time of the ancient Egyptians.
Mmm.
Muchos gracias.
Right, waiting's over.
- We've got a spot of work to do,
- All right, come on.
thank God.
- So, how often do you come here?
- Only in the summer.
It must be nice to see Dad, though?
Do you play tennis with him?
I have lessons with Lewis.
- Roper's not here much.
- Well, I expect he works hard, eh?
- That's why he has such a big house.
- I bet you've counted the rooms.
23.
There's three kitchens and a big office by the pool.
And there's Roper's secret study in his bedroom, but no-one's allowed in there.
- Except you?
Special guest?
- I'm not.
He calls it The Citadel.
And there's one key... and he hides it.
Do you know what's inside?
He says it's full of peppermints.
Well, I'd lock it up too if I were him.
Plus, there's an alarm.
They test it every day at 11.
You have to be really careful.
Why?
This is where I cut my foot last year.
Roper made me stand in the sea for about half an hour, because of the salt.
_
Ever since his daughter killed herself, he comes here every day.
And that's not all.
Yesterday afternoon, he calls the hotline of the Madrid Public Prosecutor's Office, says he has information regarding a world-class illegal arms deal.
Operator asks his name, he hangs up.
Assumption, a priest's advice only goes so far.
- Gracias, padre.
- Gracias.
Mr Apostol?
Who are you?
I'm your guardian angel, Mr Apostol.
I can't sleep.
Every night...
I ask myself the same question.
What I could have done?
Now you're having a child you can understand how I feel.
I can, Juan.
When you called the Madrid office, you had blood on your hands.
And I'm here to wash it off.
How?
- You know Richard Roper?
- Yes.
- He's a friend.
- Juan, he's not a friend.
He dragged you down and he dragged your daughter down too.
If Roper wasn't in your life, I think she'd still be alive today.
Sorry.
Now, God knows how you bear it, I...
I don't think I could.
Listen, I'm on the side of the angels.
We're good people, we play it straight and we keep our promises.
OK?
But I need your help.
Do you know Lance Corcoran?
Yes.
He's Dicky Roper's right-hand man.
Right, well, that's what needs to change.
Are you pink?
Socialist, left-wing, march of history, that sort of thing?
It wouldn't bother me if you were, it's another one of Corky's bugbears.
He seems to have a few.
Yeah.
Been in a lot of foxholes, me and Corky.
Once spent a week together in a police cell in Delhi.
I don't think I've ever laughed so much in my whole life.
Was he drinking then?
Well, now, that is a deeply odd thing to say.
What business is it of yours how much he drinks?
When my father was serving in Belfast a sergeant in his platoon got drunk one night, told a local girl what the next day's operation was.
The man I loved most in the world was dead for five pints of lager and the promise of a quickie.
Right, so you don't drink and you're not pink, what are you?
Me, I'm a free man.
Free to think, free to work, free to climb a mountain or lie in bed all day eating peppermint creams without any bugger telling me how.
Then I'm a free man.
Oh, that's the free part, the man part's a little different.
See, children grow up thinking the adult world is ordered, rational, fit for purpose.
It's crap.
Becoming a man is realising... that it's all rotten.
Realising how to celebrate that rottenness, that's freedom.
Here we are.
Out we go.
Come on.
Chop chop.
Let's go.
Mademoiselle.
- Merci, monsieur.
- OK.
Senor?
The bags, please.
Thank you so much.
Thank you so much for coming.
Have a wonderful day.
Caro, divine as ever.
- Sandy, sort of acceptable.
- There you go.
Apo, my dear old friend.
- I'm so terribly sorry for your loss.
- Thanks.
How are you?
I can't even imagine.
Mr Barghati, thank you so much for coming.
Please come inside.
Let's see if we can feed and sustain you before we get down to business.
And did you get the sweater?
Great.
Does it fit?
Mmm.
Uh-huh.
OK.
Love you.
Bye, honey.
I'm so sorry to interrupt.
The guests are arriving and the party's going to start soon.
The story begins in Egypt 4,500 years ago.
The ancient Egyptians invented this game.
It is literally the oldest trick in the book.
Now, you start with a ball.
We have one, two, three cups.
You lay one cup like that, one cup like that, one cup like that...
All right?
Now, I'm going to take the ball and I'm going to place the ball in the cup.
Shake the cup.
Turn it over.
All right, now, you have to watch very closely.
You have to watch the cups.
I'm going to move these two round like that.
This one round like that.
Everybody clear on where the ball is now?
Danny, where's the ball?
You think the ball's here?
No, Danny, the ball's in the middle!
You're not watching the cups, Danny.
Thomas is watching the cups, aren't you, Thomas?
You're a gym bunny, aren't you?
Aren't you?
A little cold gym bunny...
He can't stop his mouth... in every way.
Corky can get a little overexcited when he's drunk.
Yes, that is what Mr Barghati is worried about.
That little smile...
According to our friend, he has been shooting his mouth off... talking about things he should not.
Barghati doesn't want him involved... condition of the deal.
- Thanks for that, Apo.
- Spit.
Yeah!
Come...
Come with me...
And it's a funny thing, isn't it?
If you want to piss...
I am so sorry to interrupt, but can I just borrow the old man for a second?
- Oh, of course.
- Thank you.
- Excuse me.
- Bye.
Bye.
I have just spoken to Apo, and he has a...
There you go, Danny.
Thomas.
For God's sake...
Roper,
Thomas and I are going to go for a little stroll.
All right, darling.
Frisky, Major Corkoran is here with some friends of Dorothy that I would like to have escorted from the premises.
You and Tabby can make as much noise as you like.
All right?
- A pleasure.
- Tabbs.
If you need to relieve yourself, it's good to do it into a suitable perspective.
It's better than a urinal, isn't it?
- God's urinal, I call this.
- You've got to break it up.
You're giving the boss indigestion with your buddies here.
- Come on, lads.
The party's over.
- Frisky, go pee-pee.
Leave your drinks here.
Frisky, don't be too rough.
Who are all these people?
How should I know?
You're not curious?
Why should I be?
- It's business.
- Which is what?
Buying and selling agricultural equipment.
Caro says Sandy tells her everything.
That would drive me insane.
You shouldn't have seen me like that today, in my bedroom.
I'm sorry.
The door was open.
I thought you were dressed.
That's not what I meant.
I don't care who sees me naked.
I do care who sees me crying.
You tell no-one you saw that, is that clear?
Of course.
I'm going swimming.
- Want to come?
- Ah...
I don't think that would be wise.
There's no current.
That's not quite what I meant.
I know it wasn't.
There she goes, beyond the ha-ha!
One day, Thomas, you'll live a little.
_
Erm, come...
Rex, do you have a minute?
The Permanent Secretary would love to see you.
Erm, yes.
- Is that a yes or a no?
- Mm-hmm.
Rex, come in.
- You know Geoffrey Dromgoole, of course,
- Geoffrey.
- and his team from the River.
- Rex.
Barbara Vandon from the American Embassy.
Rex Mayhew, my undersecretary.
- Good to see you, Rex.
- Barbara, how are you?
Rex, it's this Limpet thing.
Limpet?
The Joel Steadman enforcement operation with Angela Burr on side-saddle.
Yes, I know what Limpet is...
it's an enforcement case.
It's nothing to do with Langley... or River House.
Well, it's what Barbara feels we ought to be discussing.
Rex, Langley has been completely railroaded on this.
Currently, we have a joint operation on foreign soil between two extremely fringe outfits.
They're chasing international arms in an area of the world that is... way beyond their comprehension.
It's crazy.
I have to say, I agree.
You know, Limpet is operating in a highly incendiary region, and I would hate to see that run out of control.
In my view, it should be placed under a purely intelligence jurisdiction, acting on a political brief, but, it's not my decision.
No, it's not.
I'm sure I don't need to remind you or your team that my recommendation, accepted by the Permanent Secretary, was that River House was overextended, and that enforcement agencies were urgently needed to prosecute any areas of international criminal activity that were,
for whatever reason, slipping through the intelligence net.
In that context, I find the actions of River House somewhat inimical to the new era of parliamentary accountability and transparency.
Does that answer your question?
- Why don't we leave it there for today?
- Thank you.
Have you got a moment?
Not much more than that...
Celia's cooking rabbit.
That's all it will take.
Good job in there.
You pressed all the right buttons...
accountability, transparency...
I don't like being bullied, never have.
You see, the thing is, I'm not sure that Limpet's quite the abject failure that Angela Burr would have us believe.
Really?
So, the day that the Limpet case is ours, you get an uncle in Switzerland who has suffered an untimely death... a rich uncle.
I'm going to pretend I didn't hear that.
You're in over your head, Rex.
- It's...
- Don't answer now... but think about it.
Enjoy the rabbit.
- Morning.
- Hi.
- Are you not swimming?
- I'm not in the mood.
I like you, Thomas...
You see everything and say nothing.
My husband is screwing our nanny.
What a cliché.
Jed said I should have hired an uglier girl but the agency only had stunners.
Could you do my back?
Don't worry, I don't want to sleep with you.
- Why is he keeping you here?
- I don't know.
Grooming you, is he?
For what?
You just be careful.
Roper's planning a big arms deal to Apo's Lebanese friend.
Weapons from seven British and American companies... weapons no-one should be trading in.
Roper's using a company called TradePass to fence the deal.
He pretends it trades in agricultural equipment and his investors pretend to believe him.
You can stop rubbing now.
Why are you telling me this?
I just want to be honest with someone in this world.
Does Jed know?
No, of course not!
Sandy screws everyone and tells me everything.
Roper is steadfastly faithful and tells Jed nothing.
Do you think I should tell her?
Maybe.
If it's worry for your boy, forget it.
He knew what he was getting into.
Did he?
So, you and Mr Burr, are you making a go of it?
Well, you know, like my mum says, "You make your bed... you die in it."
No, Gordon's a decent man.
It's not his fault I'm not in love with him.
Listen...
Oh, Joel, let's not have that conversation, please?
Well, you can't deny the past.
- Past is all it is.
- It doesn't have to be.
Joel...
You silly sod.
Hi, Corky.
Frisky.
Hey, Danny.
Thomas, have you seen my phone?
I haven't.
Sorry.
Dad'll be cross.
Everyone's cross and Jed's not talking to Dad.
What's going on?
I don't know.
I'll tell you what, why don't I come downstairs and read you a bedtime story, and we can look for your phone in the morning?
OK.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
What should we read?
I don't know.
Which one's your favourite?
Three Little Pigs.
OK, the pigs?
I can give you the Thomas version...
Two Little Pigs.
No.
What's that?
That right there.
Punch that up.
Punch that up.
What is it?
It's your boy.
"Seven tractor firms"...
seven armament manufacturers?
"Home sale with best friend", that's the UK and the US.
"Buyer in Beirut via Worst Man".
Well, Worst Man is Roper.
Roper's the middleman?
- What's TradePass?
- I'm not sure, must be a front organisation.
What I do know, though, is Roper's pressed the green light.
All right.
OK.
Hey, guys...
OK, so, just put the cases by the taxi and then you can jump in.
Good girl.
Pop in.
Jump in.
OK, put your seatbelts on, guys.
OK...
OK.
Here we go.
Get in the taxi, you bloody whore!
- Caroline, for...
- You bitch!
Caroline, for Christ's sake, she's going.
She's going.
She's go...
- Caro...
- Bitch!
- Whore!
- Caroline.
- Just shut up!
- All right.
Just shut up, Sandy, you shit!
What, you like the show?
You like the show, Dicky?
Dicky Roper?
See you later, guys.
Jed, darling...
Don't even.
Where is everybody?
- Monaco.
- Huh.
Two days of meetings.
Things are ramping up.
And you're not...
- You're not going too?
- Not me, no.
The girl was supposed to go but she's blown him out.
I'm staying with her.
We're going riding instead.
Didn't she invite you?
Oh, dear.
Very good.
Well, have a nice time.
I'll just be a minute.
What are you doing in here?
I brought you some flowers.
Why didn't you give them to the maids?
- I have to change.
- Close the door.
You can't be in here.
This is our bedroom.
What is that?
I found it on the desktop.
You broke into his office and you spied on his papers.
You have to be more careful.
Darling, Angel, Sweetie, everyone's starving...
- He can't see you.
- Get rid of him.
Are you decent?
- What's going on?
- Nothing.
I'm coming.
_
How was your trip?
Noisy.
I hitched a ride on a C-130.
- Oh, fun.
- How was yours?
Fine, thank you.
I'm not sure why we had to make it.
Is there a reason we're doing this in person?
Well, Halo is not too keen on intermediaries just now.
And yet he's sent you?
There's an enforcement operation called Limpet.
We have to keep our eyes on it.
Halo says you need to be careful.
I am always careful.
How far have they got?
They've drawn a line between Langbourne and Apostol.
- Jesus.
- How did they manage that?
A photograph of a meeting.
Are they after buyers or sellers?
We don't know.
We assume both.
You can assure Halo that we have taken every precaution.
We have received intelligence of our own.
We are changing the guard.
Good.
How was your meeting?
It was fine.
It was fine?
Don't be so bloody childish!
Look, Caro was upset.
She wanted to get back at Sandy so she started spreading manure.
That's it.
End of story.
That's what it is... it's just a story?
Jesus, Jed, what the hell is the matter with you?
Tell me why I should believe you.
Why shouldn't you believe me?
- When have I ever lied to you?
- Oh, you... you don't lie to me.
You're much too clever for that.
You just hide.
- What?
What do I hide?
- The truth, Roper!
Well, what about your truth?
What about the things you hide from me?
I don't hide anything from you.
You have a child, Jed!
You have a son.
Let's start with him.
Or don't you think he counts?
How do you know that?
We're not talking how, we're talking why.
Why would you hide that from me?
That was not included in the brochure.
Screw your brochure, Roper.
You don't own me.
No-one is entitled to know things about me that I don't want them to know.
Oh, but you're entitled to spy on my life?
I can read a bloody bank statement.
I'm paying money to raise another man's kid.
I know that and now anyone listening to this phone call knows it too.
Apart from that, how was your day?
_
On your feet, soldier.
Where the hell did he get that?
- "Halo".
- Yeah.
They're back?
Apparently so.
The chief wants to see you.
Not you, him.
Present for you on the table.
Thank you.
I told them to put some visas in it and make it look scruffy.
Never trust a new passport, in my view.
Always go with the old 'uns... like Third World taxi drivers, there's a reason they have survived.
"Andrew Birch"?
We like the tree thing, we thought we'd stick with that.
It's all official.
You are reborn.
The visas are real.
If you want to renew, go to the consulate abroad...
less risky.
- What's up?
- Erm, I thought that was my present.
Well, it can be, if you do something for me.
Right.
Sandy, papers.
Mm-hmm.
We're going to need a witness... preferably Spanish so they can't actually read the bloody thing.
I'll get Carlos.
- Is he 18?
- Yeah.
Wait, what is this?
What am I signing?
Jesus, Pine, for a murderer on the run, you're pretty bloody picky.
I am giving you your own company.
Erm...
Look, I...
Look, I really...
I don't know anything about running a company.
You don't have to.
All you have to do is sign as Andrew Birch.
Why don't you practise a few signatures?
Get the feel of it.
Andrew Birch.
B-I-R,
C for Charlie,
H for Hotel.
Go on.
Manly one.
Go for a manly one.
Andrew Birch in a hurry.
Andrew Birch.
One more.
That's more like it.
Carlos, ven aqui.
- Necesito que firmes esto.
- _
_
_
There and there and one more there.
Carlos, here, right at the bottom.
Good lad.
Welcome to the family, Andrew.
Previously on The Originals...
If this prophecy is fulfilled, you will all fall.
One by friend, one by foe, and one by family.
The Ancestors are doing this to you.
You have to get out of this city, somewhere where they can't reach you.
Did Nik ever mention to you what happens when a vampire goes into a room without being invited?
Let her go!
Aurora's still out cold.
What are the chances of keeping her that way?
Well, my spell will keep her down.
Covens will never know peace with the Mikaelsons living here.
Now, my guess is, the Ancestors see Lucien as a weapon.
This transformed me into something new.
My bite is lethal.
Ah.
All the makings of a lovely day.
Ah, Camille!
Finally awake.
Perfect.
You've got a big day ahead of you.
You bit me.
And sampled quite a bit of your blood, actually.
It was very tasty.
Although more bitter than I expected.
Oh, my God.
I'm gonna die.
Yeah.
Apologies.
But, to be honest, your days were numbered the moment you caught Nik's eye.
'Tis ever thus for those who get close to the bastard.
Myself excluded.
Ah.
Care for tea?
Oh, please, Cami.
Have you not learned?
If you try to fight me, you will always lose.
Enough.
If you insist on making things difficult...
Klaus?
- Klaus?
- What is it?
Something happened and you're gonna be angry, but Lucien wants you to be angry.
He's trying to lure you into a trap.
What did he do?
Promise me you won't fly off the handle and do something crazy.
Promise me.
Before you lose it...
Klaus... look at me.
I love you.
And I won't let you get yourself killed.
Camille...
I just needed you to know.
I can tell you I love you tomorrow.
You're not dying today.
Cami?
Cami.
Hey.
Are you all right?
Yeah.
Considering.
Hold still.
This is going to burn.
Ow.
Ow, what is that?
It's a healing salve.
Motherwort.
White willow bark.
The recipe's over 1,000 years old.
So, the good stuff, huh?
Well, it will ease the pain, dull the symptoms, but... it won't stop the infection.
So I'm screwed.
We're gonna do everything that we can, Cami.
To that end, a little assistance.
Cami, I'm so sorry.
You should be.
This is your fault.
It was you who turned Lucien into a beast.
Klaus.
Stop.
It's not his fault.
Cami's right.
We all need to work together to fix this.
Yeah.
Yeah, I think I know how to fix it.
Lucien has always been obsessed with me.
He made himself like me.
My bite is cured by my blood.
Do you think his blood can save her?
It makes sense.
Lucien would want that power.
Allowing him to lord himself over his victims.
Okay, so we got a working theory.
Now we gotta test it.
Lucien's blood is all over my apartment.
I sliced him all to hell before I ran.
Okay, I got this one.
Lucien's got no reason to be on the lookout for me.
Maybe... maybe we hedge our bets.
Hope is a Mikaelson witch who carries the wolf gene.
We already know that she has healing power.
It's worth a try.
I'll tell Mary that I'm coming.
You just leave?
No good-bye, nothing.
What are you doing here?
I tried to use magic to track you.
Then I realized you were hiding somewhere magic couldn't reach.
Davina, you should go.
Why would you leave without telling me?
Why would you come back if you weren't going to tell me?
- Why are you walking away?
- I didn't want to go.
Nor was it my intention to come back.
The Ancestors won't let me leave.
The second I got to the city limits,
I started to desiccate.
I'm cursed, luv.
Those witch spirits have their hooks deep inside of me.
They allow me no peace, just a hunger that I can't control.
Look, there's got to be a fix.
Just promise you'll never leave me again.
I'm in the middle of something.
Davina, we have a situation.
Lucien went after Cami.
Now, she managed to get away, but he bit her.
What?
Is she...?
No, no, no, no.
She's still alive.
Klaus is with her at the compound.
I'm headed there now.
Let me come get you.
No.
I'll meet you there.
Be careful.
All right?
Lucien could be anywhere.
Klaus?
You should be laying down.
You should be getting me soup.
It's the one advantage to being sick.
Or we could just stand here and stare at your comatose ex.
I was wrong to deny you the satisfaction of revenge.
I know I'm supposed to be this big, bad vampire, but all of the sudden, I'm not so hung up on "revenge."
Am I angry at what Aurora did to me?
Yeah.
And I've been living in fear of what else she might do.
But... all of that anger and fear, that's not me.
I'm the kind of person that helps people like Aurora.
I'm not gonna let her take that away from me.
I'm not arguing with you.
If I'm gonna help Cami,
I need to go right to the source of the problem.
Lucien is an unstoppable monster made by the Ancestors.
I have stood up to Klaus.
I'm not afraid of some second-string copycat.
But I can't leave here.
And I am not letting you walk into a fight by yourself.
Let go.
You can barely control yourself.
Now, if Lucien's working with the Ancestors, maybe he can tell me what they've done to you.
This is madness.
You can't fight him!
I don't need to fight him.
I need him to tell me the truth.
And I know a way to do that.
So just stay here, wish me luck.
Davina!
Davina!
This will help slow the spread of the infection.
In the meantime, you need to keep her relaxed.
My talents do not lend themselves to playing nursemaid.
Do you care about her?
Figure it out.
It really is a beautiful day.
Well, perhaps once we've got all this sorted, we can go for a stroll.
My sister gave me this concoction.
She assures me it will put you on the mend.
Unfortunately, she's not quite the mixologist you are.
If I am really am dying, there's no way that's gonna be my last drink.
What can I get you?
Bourbon.
- Neat.
- Neat?
Either you're extremely sophisticated or you've had one hell of a day.
Need the two be mutually exclusive?
I loved being a bartender.
That endless parade of faces...
Each night, someone new would come in with a good story.
One guy's shy, the other won't shut up.
Cheers.
I used to think if you just give someone a little booze, they'll tell you anything.
Then I realized it wasn't the alcohol.
People just want someone to listen.
Yes, well, you're quite adept at listening.
In fact, I would so far as to call you a connoisseur of stories.
Particularly mine.
I should've published your memoir.
I would've made a fortune.
Hey, will you do something for me?
You'd think with current events, I would've written a will.
But no time like the present.
Will you write a few things down?
- Camille.
- Look,
I've made my peace with dying.
I just... don't want to leave any loose ends, so...
Besides...
I was your stenographer.
You owe me.
What the hell, man?
Elijah called.
Said you'd be here.
I came to watch your back.
How is she?
How you think she is?
She got pulled into a vampire vendetta, and now if we can't make this work, she's gonna die, so she's scared, she's angry, and right about now, she's probably wishing that she never set foot in the Quarter.
You care about her.
So do I.
And I know you want to help her, so focus.
Do what you got to do.
Yeah.
Vincent?
What's wrong?
Ooh...
The Ancestors are fickle.
They don't want me using magic, because they know
I sided with vampires.
Come on.
Ah!
Ladies and gentlemen, make some noise!
Come on, let the Mikaelsons hear you!
Even now they hide in their dreadful outdated fortress, while we celebrate the liberation of New Orleans!
Klaus' tenure is at an end.
I expect he will arrive soon enough, seeking his retribution.
And when he does, our real party can begin!
You know, it's not polite to stare.
Well!
What have we here?
Davina Claire.
Tossing about sleeping spells.
Rather clever, if somewhat of a buzzkill.
Oh, speaking of killing...
Oh, did you honestly bring your favorite doll to a bar fight?
The Figure Veritas will make sure the next words you speak are the truth.
Oh...
To Davina,
I leave everything in my closet.
Just nothing too revealing.
To Josh, my records.
To Vincent... my books and all of Kieran's files.
To Elijah,
I have an old game of Trivial Pursuit under my bed.
To Hayley, my dark objects.
Will you make sure that she gives them to Hope when she's old enough?
Hope's a New Orleans witch.
She should have them.
And to you...
Enough!
This is-is pointless.
We're going to find a way to fix it.
I suppose I should just fess up.
Tell you all my deepest, darkest secrets.
I'm a Scorpio.
I prefer wine to whisky.
Got a bit of a sweet tooth.
Um... oh, my greatest joy is listening to the screams of my victims just before I end them.
Tell me how to cure Cami!
So persistent.
No wonder The Ancestors find you so annoying.
How splendid that they have a plan to shut you up for good.
Oh, no need to point that hideous thing at me, luv.
I'm happy to tell you whatever you want to know.
How are you doing this?
Oh, not me, luv.
I've got The Ancestors on my side.
Ready with a wealth of witchy woes for those who oppose me.
Come in.
How is she?
Let's just hopes this works.
Why would The Ancestors help you?
I made them a promise.
See, if they help me, we'd exterminate a certain family of vermin vampires.
Innocents may get caught in the crossfire.
Here, drink this.
You silly fools with your unbridled optimism!
Always hoping there's some way out.
Some loophole to save you from your doom.
Well, the thing is
I don't believe in loopholes.
My bite has no cure.
Your sweet Camille is going to die.
Mary doesn't want vampires near her cabin.
It's probably better if you just stay here.
She's aware that you and Hope are under my protection.
Unfortunately for Mary, that didn't do much for her grandson, did it?
You know I couldn't prevent that.
Yes, I do.
But here we are again with someone else's life on the life.
Only this time I'm taking my two-year-old daughter into a warzone on the off chance that it might save my friend from dying.
I mean, do see how insane our lives have become?
What do you want me to do?
I don't know.
I just can't keep losing people.
First Jack.
Now we might lose Cami.
Who's next?
Klaus?
Me?
You?
I'm not afraid to die.
Neither are you.
We fight for those we love.
Perfect day at a corner cafe.
You really outdid yourself.
If only it were real.
It will do to pass the time while we wait for the cure to take effect.
And then tomorrow when you're recovered, we can travel anywhere you like.
Perhaps we'll go to Santorini for some vinsanto or to Rome for the perfect espresso.
I've always wanted to go to Venice.
Ride in a gondola down the Grand Canal.
Well, then we must start there.
I wish I had known you were such a romantic.
I wouldn't have played so hard to get.
Let us not speak of regrets.
We are in the perfect moment of the perfect day.
Let's try to enjoy it.
She's getting worse.
Okay, then we, uh, we got to try something else!
Marcel?
The Strix?
You mean to tell me they can't help with this?
The Strix don't have a solution for something that's never existed before.
Lucien engineered a pure strain of wolf venom.
Designed to kill even an Original.
It may be there is no cure.
Well, I'm not giving up.
Neither am I, but...
Okay, um... blood magic's not working.
So what else is there?
How about a magical miracle baby?
You are going to wake them, aren't you?
I've got a party to finish.
Go to hell.
Ah.
Still smarting over the whole Cami thing?
Well, if you wanted a happier tale, perhaps you should've inquired about my recent vacation to the Maldives.
Why are you doing this?
Because I can.
If you have some sick rivalry with Klaus, then you guys can compete to see who's most miserable, but you don't have to hurt Cami.
Of course I do!
Nik stole the love of my life!
A shattering defeat for most men.
But I have since realized that love simply makes one weak.
And I can prove it.
When Cami dies,
Nik will be struck by such overpowering grief, he will lash out at me.
But I, being unencumbered by something so mawkish as a romantic attachment, will end him.
Now, since I have been so kind as to answer all your questions and you are by no means capable of stopping me, could you be so kind as to please go on your way?
Why are you letting me go?
Ah, my darling... you are not mine to kill.
The Ancestors have something else in store for you.
You should ask your boyfriend Kol about it.
This is my favorite time of day.
You can feel the city coming alive.
The lights turn on, the music cranks up...
It's lovely, save for the incessant parade of inebriated buffoons.
I should have omitted them when I conjured this.
You don't get to delete the details that annoy you.
If you love something, you have to accept the good with the bad.
I prefer to shape reality to my will.
That's a far better practice than simply accepting what's been offered.
Even you don't get to micromanage the world.
Besides, it's an unhealthy impulse.
It is for those who'd defy me.
Healthy, happy people get by just fine when they don't get their way.
The whole revenge thing, the obsession with power... it's all rooted in fear.
I've been around 1,000 years.
I've endured as many horrors as I've committed.
What could I possibly have to fear?
For one, you're afraid of what will happen when I'm gone.
I don't want to talk about this.
I'm just trying to enjoy my perfect day.
And I will be able to, if you allow me make my point.
Do you remember when we first met?
You were so damaged.
Manipulative.
People were just things that you used to get what you wanted.
That's a harsh appraisal.
Though, I admit accurate.
But you wanted to show me you were more than that.
So you showed me your whole life.
You wanted to be understood, Klaus.
That's a human impulse, and if you're capable of that after everything you've been through, then you're capable of everything else that comes with being human: joy, hope, love.
Do you know that, Klaus?
You are loved.
By Elijah.
Rebekah.
Freya.
Why are you telling me this?
Because love will make you strong.
It will make you the man that I know you want to be.
And you're gonna have to remember that... because I won't to be here to remind you.
Hey, hey.
Look at me.
It's gonna be okay.
You lied to me.
I warned you there would be consequences.
The Ancestors tampered with the spell I used to bring you back.
We knew that.
But you didn't tell me how.
It was a dark spell to begin with.
They want you to kill me, right?
They want revenge.
Why didn't you say something?
What would you have me say?
"Thank you for saving me from unending torment,
"I adore you with all my heart.
"Oh, and by the way, all I want to do is rip out your throat."
And the longer I hold out, the worse it gets.
- I can protect myself.
- No.
Eventually, I'll give in.
But there is another way.
Where did you find that?
The first thing I did when you brought me back was to hunt it down, to make sure that Nik wouldn't stick it in me the second I annoyed him.
I have always hated these bloody things.
But we've run out of options.
- No.
I can fix you.
- I know you can.
But this is to make certain that you're safe until you do.
All right, think of it as a short sleep.
Easy to endure, knowing that you'll be waiting when I wake.
Safe and sound.
This isn't fair.
I've waited so long to have you back.
Wait a little longer, bring me back when my mind is right.
As it is, you can't trust me,
which means you can't love me.
Not as I love you.
Ah...
Anything?
I've tried everything that I know, including the power that resides in the blood of our niece.
The infection has spread everywhere.
There's nothing more we can do.
Klaus can ease her pain, but... she won't last much longer.
Freya, we gotta do something.
All right?
So channel me, cast a healing spell, and that'll buy us enough time...
It won't stop the inevitable.
Okay, then put her soul in that damn pendant.
It worked for Finn,
- it will work...
- Dahlia crafted the pendant.
It will only work for our family.
I could put her soul in another body...
No.
She'd have to agree for the transfer to hold and she wouldn't do that to an innocent person.
Not even to save herself.
Well, maybe we worry about that later.
We cannot deny her the dignity of choice.
Camille lived with grace.
She will have it now.
The painter.
The music, the crowd...
This is the night we met.
You remember every detail.
I must've made an impression.
You know very well you did.
We talked about the artist wanting to control his demons.
Do you think he ever did?
Some demons will not be tamed.
We just do the best we can... and never give up.
I'm getting tired.
Camille...
It's funny...
Even though we're so different...
I feel like I've always known you.
Maybe it's because I've been in your mind, or maybe that's just how you know you love someone.
I do love you, you know.
I thought you were going to tell me that tomorrow.
I really don't have another tomorrow, do I?
The noise... the people.
Will-will you make it go away?
Klaus?
What's-what-what, what's happening?
Your heart is slowing.
But it still beats.
You're fighting.
Because you want to live.
I wanted to be brave.
I wanted to handle this with dignity.
But I...
I-I can't.
I...
I don't want to go.
I'm so scared.
I'm here.
I'm here.
So much for the brave bartender, huh?
When I said I was ready to die,
I was full of it.
And I just wish I had done more than to serve a few drinks and fail completely as your therapist.
Don't you think for a moment that you failed me.
You stayed my hand.
Quelled my rage.
You inspired goodness in me.
And unlike all of the souls I've encountered and forgotten in the long march of time...
I will carry you with me.
I guess that makes me immortal.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Not yet.
Just stay a bit longer?
Do you remember the Bible verse on John's headstone?
"The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it."
I was never naive enough to think that...
I was your light.
But there is light in you.
All that anger, the cycle of abuse that Mikael began, you can end it.
You have to.
So you can be the light for your little girl.
For Hope.
No.
Do not be afraid.
You go now where many have gone before you.
And where even I will go in time.
Just know... there will be no more pain.
No more heartbreak.
You will find peace.
Marcel?
You got me at a loss.
See, all I can think about is how much the Quarter still needs you.
How much I still need you, truth be told.
But I won't forget what we set out to do.
And I won't ever shy away from doing what needs to be done.
If I stand against all that darkness, even if I do get chopped down,
I know you're right there ahead of me.
Keeping the fire warm and the beers cold.
Until then, sweet lady.
Until then.
This isn't over.
Not much in the way of comfort.
Well, there's work to be done.
Lucien goes down.
No rest for the wicked.
No rest.
Niklaus?
Will he be all right?
This isn't over.
You know, I've been thinking how my little girl is never gonna know you.
It's not fair.
Considering everything that you did for her dad.
You know, sometimes I can't stand him?
But I always figured if he liked you, he couldn't be that bad.
This family owes you.
You deserved better.
What happened to her is on me.
I did the spell that turned Lucien into... whatever the hell he is.
And he used my blood.
My family's magic.
Which means we made him.
And now that we have his blood... we're gonna find a way to unmake him.
I really wish I could talk to you right now.
Kol?
No, stop!
Davina?
No, no, no...
Wake up!
Wake up!
Wake up...
Wake up.
CAMI:
Previously on The Originals...
FREYA:
If this prophecy is fulfilled, you will all fall.
One by friend, one by foe, and one by family.
(Grunts)
The Ancestors are doing this to you.
You have to get out of this city, somewhere where they can't reach you.
(Gasping in pain)
(Panting)
Did Nik ever mention to you what happens when a vampire goes into a room without being invited?
(Screaming)
Let her go!
HAYLEY:
Aurora's still out cold.
What are the chances of keeping her that way?
Well, my spell will keep her down.
Covens will never know peace with the Mikaelsons living here.
Now, my guess is, the Ancestors see Lucien as a weapon.
This transformed me into something new.
- My bite is lethal.
- (Screams)
(Indistinct chatter, traffic in distance)
Ah.
All the makings of a lovely day.
(Gasps)
Ah, Camille!
Finally awake.
Perfect.
You've got a big day ahead of you.
You bit me.
And sampled quite a bit of your blood, actually.
It was very tasty.
Although more bitter than I expected.
Oh, my God.
I'm gonna die.
Yeah.
Apologies.
But, to be honest, your days were numbered the moment you caught Nik's eye.
'Tis ever thus for those who get close to the bastard.
Myself excluded.
(Whistling)
Ah.
Care for tea?
Oh, please, Cami.
Have you not learned?
If you try to fight me, you will always lose.
(Groans)
(Sighs)
Enough.
If you insist on making things difficult... (Grunts)
(Sighs)
(Panting)
CAMI:
Klaus?
(Panting)
- Klaus?
‭
- What is it?
Something happened and you're gonna be angry, but Lucien wants you to be angry.
He's trying to lure you into a trap.
What did he do?
Promise me you won't fly off the handle and do something crazy.
Promise me.
Before you lose it...
Klaus... look at me.
I love you.
And I won't let you get yourself killed.
- Camille... ‭ - (Gasping)
I just needed you to know.
I can tell you I love you tomorrow.
You're not dying today.
(Buzzing whine)
(Muffled):
Cami?
Cami.
(Buzzing whine continues)
Cami...
- (Buzzing stops)
- Hey.
Are you all right?
Yeah.
Considering.
Hold still.
This is going to burn.
(Gasps) Ow.
Ow, what is that?
It's a healing salve.
Motherwort.
White willow bark.
The recipe's over 1,000 years old.
So, the good stuff, huh?
Well, it will ease the pain, dull the symptoms, but... it won't stop the infection.
So I'm screwed.
We're gonna do everything that we can, Cami.
ELIJAH:
To that end, a little assistance.
Cami, I'm so sorry.
You should be.
This is your fault.
It was you who turned Lucien into a beast.
CAMI:
Klaus.
Stop.
It's not his fault.
HAYLEY:
Cami's right.
We all need to work together to fix this.
KLAUS:
Yeah.
Yeah, I think I know how to fix it.
Lucien has always been obsessed with me.
He made himself like me.
My bite is cured by my blood.
Do you think his blood can save her?
ELIJAH:
It makes sense.
Lucien would want that power.
Allowing him to lord himself over his victims.
Okay, so we got a working theory.
Now we gotta test it.
Lucien's blood is all over my apartment.
I sliced him all to hell before I ran.
Okay, I got this one.
Lucien's got no reason to be on the lookout for me.
Maybe... maybe we hedge our bets.
Hope is a Mikaelson witch who carries the wolf gene.
We already know that she has healing power.
It's worth a try.
I'll tell Mary that I'm coming.
(Ship's horn blares)
DAVINA:
You just leave?
No good-bye, nothing.
What are you doing here?
I tried to use magic to track you.
Then I realized you were hiding somewhere magic couldn't reach.
Davina, you should go.
Why would you leave without telling me?
Why would you come back if you weren't going to tell me?
- Why are you walking away?
- I didn't want to go.
Nor was it my intention to come back.
The Ancestors won't let me leave.
The second I got to the city limits,
I started to desiccate.
I'm cursed, luv.
Those witch spirits have their hooks deep inside of me.
They allow me no peace, just a hunger that I can't control.
Look, there's got to be a fix.
Just promise you'll never leave me again.
(Phone buzzing)
I'm in the middle of something.
Davina, we have a situation.
Lucien went after Cami.
Now, she managed to get away, but he bit her.
What?
Is she...?
MARCEL:
No, no, no, no.
She's still alive.
Klaus is with her at the compound.
I'm headed there now.
Let me come get you.
No.
I'll meet you there.
Be careful.
All right?
Lucien could be anywhere.
Klaus?
You should be laying down.
You should be getting me soup.
It's the one advantage to being sick.
Or we could just stand here and stare at your comatose ex.
I was wrong to deny you the satisfaction of revenge.
I know I'm supposed to be this big, bad vampire, but all of the sudden, I'm not so hung up on "revenge."
Am I angry at what Aurora did to me?
Yeah.
And I've been living in fear of what else she might do.
But... all of that anger and fear, that's not me.
I'm the kind of person that helps people like Aurora.
I'm not gonna let her take that away from me.
DAVINA:
I'm not arguing with you.
If I'm gonna help Cami,
I need to go right to the source of the problem.
Lucien is an unstoppable monster made by the Ancestors.
I have stood up to Klaus.
I'm not afraid of some second-string copycat.
But I can't leave here.
And I am not letting you walk into a fight by yourself.
Let go.
You can barely control yourself.
Now, if Lucien's working with the Ancestors, maybe he can tell me what they've done to you.
This is madness.
You can't fight him!
I don't need to fight him.
I need him to tell me the truth.
And I know a way to do that.
So just stay here, wish me luck.
Davina!
Davina!
This will help slow the spread of the infection.
In the meantime, you need to keep her relaxed.
My talents do not lend themselves to playing nursemaid.
Do you care about her?
Figure it out.
(Distant conversations)
It really is a beautiful day.
Well, perhaps once we've got all this sorted, we can go for a stroll.
My sister gave me this concoction.
She assures me it will put you on the mend.
(Sniffs)
Unfortunately, she's not quite the mixologist you are.
(Sniffs, groans)
If I am really am dying, there's no way that's gonna be my last drink.
What can I get you?
Bourbon.
- Neat.
- Neat?
Either you're extremely sophisticated or you've had one hell of a day.
Need the two be mutually exclusive?
I loved being a bartender.
That endless parade of faces...
Each night, someone new would come in with a good story.
One guy's shy, the other won't shut up.
Cheers.
(Places glass down)
I used to think if you just give someone a little booze, they'll tell you anything.
Then I realized it wasn't the alcohol.
People just want someone to listen.
Yes, well, you're quite adept at listening.
In fact, I would so far as to call you a connoisseur of stories.
Particularly mine.
I should've published your memoir.
I would've made a fortune.
Hey, will you do something for me?
You'd think with current events, I would've written a will.
But no time like the present.
Will you write a few things down?
- Camille.
- ‭Look,
I've made my peace with dying.
I just... don't want to leave any loose ends, so...
Besides...
I was your stenographer.
You owe me.
(Footsteps)
(Sighs) What the hell, man?
Elijah called.
Said you'd be here.
I came to watch your back.
How is she?
How you think she is?
She got pulled into a vampire vendetta, and now if we can't make this work, she's gonna die, so she's scared, she's angry, and right about now, she's probably wishing that she never set foot in the Quarter.
(Sighs)
You care about her.
So do I.
And I know you want to help her, so focus.
Do what you got to do.
Yeah.
(Chanting in ancient language)
- (Gasps) ‭
- Vincent?
What's wrong?
(Mumbles)
Ooh...
The Ancestors are fickle.
They don't want me using magic, because they know
I sided with vampires.
Come on.
(Dance music playing)
(Indistinct chatter)
Ah!
Ladies and gentlemen, make some noise!
(Crowd cheering)
Come on, let the Mikaelsons hear you!
(Crowd cheering)
Even now they hide in their dreadful outdated fortress, while we celebrate the liberation of New Orleans!
(Cheering)
Klaus' tenure is at an end.
I expect he will arrive soon enough, seeking his retribution.
And when he does, our real party can begin!
(Cheering)

Hope's a New Orleans witch.
She should have them.

We're going to find a way to fix it.
I suppose I should just fess up.
Tell you all my deepest, darkest secrets.
I'm a Scorpio.
I prefer wine to whisky.
Got a bit of a sweet tooth.
Um... oh, my greatest joy is listening to the screams of my victims just before I end them.
Tell me how to cure Cami!
So persistent.
No wonder The Ancestors find you so annoying.
How splendid that they have a plan to shut you up for good.
(Indistinct whispering)
Oh, no need to point that hideous thing at me, luv.
I'm happy to tell you whatever you want to know.
How are you doing this?

Why didn't you say something?
What would you have me say?
"Thank you for saving me from unending torment,
"I adore you with all my heart.
"Oh, and by the way, all I want to do is rip out your throat."
And the longer I hold out, the worse it gets.
- I can protect myself.
- ‭No.
Eventually, I'll give in.
But there is another way.

Where did you find that?
The first thing I did when you brought me back was to hunt it down, to make sure that Nik wouldn't stick it in me the second I annoyed him.
I have always hated these bloody things.
But we've run out of options.
- No.
I can fix you.
- I know you can.
But this is to make certain that you're safe until you do.
All right, think of it as a short sleep.

I've tried everything that I know, including the power that resides in the blood of our niece.

There's nothing more we can do.
Klaus can ease her suffering, but... she won't last much longer.
Freya, we gotta do something.
All right?
So channel me, cast a healing spell, and that'll buy us enough time...
It won't stop the inevitable.
Okay, then put her soul in that damn pendant.
It worked for Finn,
- it will work...
- Dahlia crafted the pendant.
It will only work for our family.
I could put her soul in another body...
No.
She'd have to agree for the transfer to hold and she wouldn't do that to an innocent person.
Not even to save herself.

If this prophecy is fulfilled, you will all fall.
One by friend, one by foe, and one by family.
(Grunts)
The Ancestors are doing this to you.
You have to get out of this city, somewhere where they can't reach you.
(Gasping in pain)
(Panting)
Did Nik ever mention to you what happens when a vampire goes into a room without being invited?
(Screaming)
Let her go!
HAYLEY:
Aurora's still out cold.
What are the chances of keeping her that way?
Well, my spell will keep her down.
Covens will never know peace with the Mikaelsons living here.
Now, my guess is, the Ancestors see Lucien as a weapon.
This transformed me into something new.
- My bite is lethal.

Ah.
All the makings of a lovely day.
(Gasps)
Ah, Camille!
Finally awake.
Perfect.
You've got a big day ahead of you.
You bit me.
And sampled quite a bit of your blood, actually.
It was very tasty.
Although more bitter than I expected.
Oh, my God.
I'm gonna die.
Yeah.
Apologies.
But, to be honest, your days were numbered the moment you caught Nik's eye.
'Tis ever thus for those who get close to the bastard.

What did he do?
Promise me you won't fly off the handle and do something crazy.
Promise me.
Before you lose it...
Klaus... look at me.
I love you.
And I won't let you get yourself killed.

- Hey.
Are you all right?
Yeah.
Considering.
Hold still.
This is going to burn.
(Gasps) Ow.
Ow, what is that?
It's a healing salve.
Motherwort.
White willow bark.
The recipe's over 1,000 years old.
So, the good stuff, huh?
Well, it will ease the pain, dull the symptoms, but... it won't stop the infection.
So I'm screwed.
We're gonna do everything that we can, Cami.
ELIJAH:
To that end, a little assistance.
Cami, I'm so sorry.
You should be.
This is your fault.
It was you who turned Lucien into a beast.
CAMI:
Klaus.
Stop.
It's not his fault.
HAYLEY:
Cami's right.
We all need to work together to fix this.
KLAUS:
Yeah.
Yeah, I think I know how to fix it.
Lucien has always been obsessed with me.
He made himself like me.
My bite is cured by my blood.
Do you think his blood can save her?
ELIJAH:
It makes sense.
Lucien would want that power.
Allowing him to lord himself over his victims.
Okay, so we got a working theory.
Now we gotta test it.
Lucien's blood is all over my apartment.
I sliced him all to hell before I ran.
Okay, I got this one.
Lucien's got no reason to be on the lookout for me.
Maybe... maybe we hedge our bets.
Hope is a Mikaelson witch who carries the wolf gene.
We already know that she has healing power.
It's worth a try.
I'll tell Mary that I'm coming.
(Ship's horn blares)
DAVINA:
You just leave?
No good-bye, nothing.
What are you doing here?
I tried to use magic to track you.
Then I realized you were hiding somewhere magic couldn't reach.
Davina, you should go.
Why would you leave without telling me?
Why would you come back if you weren't going to tell me?
- Why are you walking away?
- I didn't want to go.
Nor was it my intention to come back.
The Ancestors won't let me leave.
The second I got to the city limits,
I started to desiccate.
I'm cursed, luv.
Those witch spirits have their hooks deep inside of me.
They allow me no peace, just a hunger that I can't control.
Look, there's got to be a fix.
Just promise you'll never leave me again.
(Phone buzzing)
I'm in the middle of something.
Davina, we have a situation.
Lucien went after Cami.
Now, she managed to get away, but he bit her.
What?
Is she...?
MARCEL:
No, no, no, no.
She's still alive.
Klaus is with her at the compound.
I'm headed there now.
Let me come get you.
No.
I'll meet you there.
Be careful.
All right?
Lucien could be anywhere.
Klaus?
You should be laying down.
You should be getting me soup.
It's the one advantage to being sick.
Or we could just stand here and stare at your comatose ex.
I was wrong to deny you the satisfaction of revenge.
I know I'm supposed to be this big, bad vampire, but all of the sudden, I'm not so hung up on "revenge."
Am I angry at what Aurora did to me?
Yeah.
And I've been living in fear of what else she might do.
But... all of that anger and fear, that's not me.
I'm the kind of person that helps people like Aurora.
I'm not gonna let her take that away from me.
DAVINA:
I'm not arguing with you.
If I'm gonna help Cami,
I need to go right to the source of the problem.
Lucien is an unstoppable monster made by the Ancestors.
I have stood up to Klaus.
I'm not afraid of some second-string copycat.
But I can't leave here.
And I am not letting you walk into a fight by yourself.
Let go.
You can barely control yourself.
Now, if Lucien's working with the Ancestors, maybe he can tell me what they've done to you.
This is madness.
You can't fight him!
I don't need to fight him.
I need him to tell me the truth.
And I know a way to do that.
So just stay here, wish me luck.
Davina!
Davina!
This will help slow the spread of the infection.
In the meantime, you need to keep her relaxed.
My talents do not lend themselves to playing nursemaid.
Do you care about her?
Figure it out.
(Distant conversations)
It really is a beautiful day.
Well, perhaps once we've got all this sorted, we can go for a stroll.
My sister gave me this concoction.
She assures me it will put you on the mend.
(Sniffs)
Unfortunately, she's not quite the mixologist you are.
(Sniffs, groans)
If I am really am dying, there's no way that's gonna be my last drink.
What can I get you?
Bourbon.
- Neat.
- Neat?
Either you're extremely sophisticated or you've had one hell of a day.
Need the two be mutually exclusive?
I loved being a bartender.
That endless parade of faces...
Each night, someone new would come in with a good story.
One guy's shy, the other won't shut up.
Cheers.
(Places glass down)
I used to think if you just give someone a little booze, they'll tell you anything.
Then I realized it wasn't the alcohol.
People just want someone to listen.
Yes, well, you're quite adept at listening.
In fact, I would so far as to call you a connoisseur of stories.
Particularly mine.
I should've published your memoir.
I would've made a fortune.
Hey, will you do something for me?
You'd think with current events, I would've written a will.
But no time like the present.
Will you write a few things down?
- Camille.
- ‭Look,
I've made my peace with dying.
I just... don't want to leave any loose ends, so...
Besides...
I was your stenographer.
You owe me.
(Footsteps)
(Sighs) What the hell, man?
Elijah called.
Said you'd be here.
I came to watch your back.
How is she?
How you think she is?
She got pulled into a vampire vendetta, and now if we can't make this work, she's gonna die, so she's scared, she's angry, and right about now, she's probably wishing that she never set foot in the Quarter.

You care about her.
So do I.
And I know you want to help her, so focus.
Do what you got to do.
Yeah.

And I just wish I had done more than to serve a few drinks and fail completely as your therapist.
Don't you think for a moment that you failed me.

HAYLEY:
Aurora's still out cold.

Covens will never know peace with the Mikaelsons living here.

Perfect.
You've got a big day ahead of you.
You bit me.
And sampled quite a bit of your blood, actually.
It was very tasty.
Although more bitter than I expected.
Oh, my God.
I'm gonna die.
Yeah.
Apologies.
But, to be honest, your days were numbered the moment you caught Nik's eye.
'Tis ever thus for those who get close to the bastard.

Promise me.
Before you lose it...
Klaus... look at me.
I love you.

- Hey.
Are you all right?
Yeah.

Hold still.
This is going to burn.
(Gasps) Ow.
Ow, what is that?
It's a healing salve.
Motherwort.
White willow bark.
The recipe's over 1,000 years old.
So, the good stuff, huh?
Well, it will ease the pain, dull the symptoms, but... it won't stop the infection.
So I'm screwed.
We're gonna do everything that we can, Cami.
ELIJAH:
To that end, a little assistance.
Cami, I'm so sorry.
You should be.
This is your fault.
It was you who turned Lucien into a beast.
CAMI:
Klaus.
Stop.
It's not his fault.
HAYLEY:
Cami's right.
We all need to work together to fix this.
KLAUS:
Yeah.
Yeah, I think I know how to fix it.
Lucien has always been obsessed with me.
He made himself like me.
My bite is cured by my blood.
Do you think his blood can save her?
ELIJAH:
It makes sense.
Lucien would want that power.
Allowing him to lord himself over his victims.
Okay, so we got a working theory.
Now we gotta test it.
Lucien's blood is all over my apartment.
I sliced him all to hell before I ran.
Okay, I got this one.
Lucien's got no reason to be on the lookout for me.
Maybe... maybe we hedge our bets.
Hope is a Mikaelson witch who carries the wolf gene.
We already know that she has healing power.
It's worth a try.
I'll tell Mary that I'm coming.
(Ship's horn blares)
DAVINA:
You just leave?
No good-bye, nothing.
What are you doing here?
I tried to use magic to track you.
Then I realized you were hiding somewhere magic couldn't reach.
Davina, you should go.
Why would you leave without telling me?
Why would you come back if you weren't going to tell me?
- Why are you walking away?
- I didn't want to go.
Nor was it my intention to come back.
The Ancestors won't let me leave.
The second I got to the city limits,
I started to desiccate.
I'm cursed, luv.
Those witch spirits have their hooks deep inside of me.
They allow me no peace, just a hunger that I can't control.
Look, there's got to be a fix.
Just promise you'll never leave me again.
(Phone buzzing)
I'm in the middle of something.
Davina, we have a situation.
Lucien went after Cami.
Now, she managed to get away, but he bit her.
What?
Is she...?
MARCEL:
No, no, no, no.
She's still alive.
Klaus is with her at the compound.
I'm headed there now.
Let me come get you.
No.
I'll meet you there.
Be careful.
All right?
Lucien could be anywhere.
Klaus?
You should be laying down.
You should be getting me soup.
It's the one advantage to being sick.
Or we could just stand here and stare at your comatose ex.
I was wrong to deny you the satisfaction of revenge.
I know I'm supposed to be this big, bad vampire, but all of the sudden, I'm not so hung up on "revenge."
Am I angry at what Aurora did to me?
Yeah.
And I've been living in fear of what else she might do.
But... all of that anger and fear, that's not me.
I'm the kind of person that helps people like Aurora.
I'm not gonna let her take that away from me.
DAVINA:
I'm not arguing with you.
If I'm gonna help Cami,
I need to go right to the source of the problem.
Lucien is an unstoppable monster made by the Ancestors.
I have stood up to Klaus.
I'm not afraid of some second-string copycat.
But I can't leave here.
And I am not letting you walk into a fight by yourself.
Let go.
You can barely control yourself.
Now, if Lucien's working with the Ancestors, maybe he can tell me what they've done to you.
This is madness.
You can't fight him!
I don't need to fight him.
I need him to tell me the truth.
And I know a way to do that.
So just stay here, wish me luck.
Davina!
Davina!
This will help slow the spread of the infection.
In the meantime, you need to keep her relaxed.
My talents do not lend themselves to playing nursemaid.
Do you care about her?
Figure it out.
(Distant conversations)
It really is a beautiful day.
Well, perhaps once we've got all this sorted, we can go for a stroll.
My sister gave me this concoction.
She assures me it will put you on the mend.
(Sniffs)
Unfortunately, she's not quite the mixologist you are.
(Sniffs, groans)
If I am really am dying, there's no way that's gonna be my last drink.
What can I get you?
Bourbon.
- Neat.
- Neat?
Either you're extremely sophisticated or you've had one hell of a day.
Need the two be mutually exclusive?
I loved being a bartender.
That endless parade of faces...
Each night, someone new would come in with a good story.
One guy's shy, the other won't shut up.
Cheers.
(Places glass down)
I used to think if you just give someone a little booze, they'll tell you anything.
Then I realized it wasn't the alcohol.
People just want someone to listen.
Yes, well, you're quite adept at listening.
In fact, I would so far as to call you a connoisseur of stories.
Particularly mine.
I should've published your memoir.
I would've made a fortune.
Hey, will you do something for me?
You'd think with current events, I would've written a will.
But no time like the present.
Will you write a few things down?
- Camille.
- Look,
I've made my peace with dying.
I just... don't want to leave any loose ends, so...
Besides...
I was your stenographer.
You owe me.
(Footsteps)
(Sighs) What the hell, man?
Elijah called.
Said you'd be here.
I came to watch your back.
How is she?
How you think she is?
She got pulled into a vampire vendetta, and now if we can't make this work, she's gonna die, so she's scared, she's angry, and right about now, she's probably wishing that she never set foot in the Quarter.

You know I couldn't prevent that.
Yes, I do.
But here we are again with someone else's life on the life.
Only this time I'm taking my two-year-old daughter into a warzone on the off chance that it might save my friend from dying.

Nik will be struck by such overpowering grief, he will lash out at me.
But I, being unencumbered by something so mawkish as a romantic attachment, will end him.

Manipulative.
People were just things that you used to get what you wanted.
(Laughs) That's a harsh appraisal.
Though, I admit accurate.
But you wanted to show me you were more than that.
So you showed me your whole life.
You wanted to be understood, Klaus.
That's a human impulse, and if you're capable of that after everything you've been through, then you're capable of everything else that comes with being human: joy, hope, love.
Do you know that, Klaus?
You are loved.

Why are you telling me this?
Because love will make you strong.
It will make you the man that I know you want to be.
And you're gonna have to remember that... because I won't to be here to remind you.
Hey, hey.
Look at me.
It's gonna be okay.
You lied to me.
I warned you there would be consequences.
The Ancestors tampered with the spell I used to bring you back.
We knew that.
But you didn't tell me how.
It was a dark spell to begin with.
They want you to kill me, right?
They want revenge.
Why didn't you say something?
What would you have me say?
"Thank you for saving me from unending torment,
"I adore you with all my heart.
"Oh, and by the way, all I want to do is rip out your throat."

- No.
I can fix you.

Hmm.
Hmm?
Homer, are you ever planning on putting this stuff together?
Sure, right after I watch this DVD.
Just what are you watching that's so important?
Outstanding College Mascot Fights?
S.E.C. edition.
The top-heavy mascots always lose.
Unless they're fighting something with no arms.
See?
The Stanford Tree is no match for the Tulane Green Wave.
There's people inside.
Marge, do you see?
Maggie!
That's it, mister.
You're putting everything together today.
Marjorie, isn't it a little sexist to expect me to do all the carpentry?
Or you can take Bart to the mall to get fitted for...
Sorry, the drill is too loud!
I can't hear the options!
"Vous avez 'termine'"?
"Vous avez 'termine'"?
"Du ar klar"?
"Du bist fertig"?
"You are 'fini-shed'"?
Oh, I am finished!
Whoo-hoo!
D'oh!
I'm trapped.
Here, boy.
Come here.
Who's a good Allen wrench?
You's a good Allen wrench.
Come here.
Come on.
Huh?
That isn't the same Allen wrench I swallowed.
Hey, Barney, how's it going?
Fine.
How are you?
I need help.
Can you come right over?
Homer, you should use the Choremonkey app.
People do all your chores, so you're free to follow your dreams.
My dream right now is beer and toilet paper.
Mr. Gumble, because I'm a decent person, this is the last beer I'm going to bring you.
I'll just use Uburp.
Stop eating me, I'm not dead yet!
Choremonkey to the rescue.
Oh!
Oh, thank you.
I think this is the beginning of an unhealthy dependence.
Aw.

Homie,
I don't like that the house is full of strangers all the time.
And I... wait, wait, why are you taking out your phone?
No.
Don't you Choremonkey me!
Sweetie, you know I'm no good at arguments, so I brought in a professional.
Hello, ma'am, my name's Blake, and I'm a retired FBI hostage negotiator.
I wouldn't say this is a hostage situation.
Mm, no one said it was, ma'am.
I'm just here to listen.
So that was step one:
listening.
Next, empathy.
I'm standing right here, you know.
Mm, it must be frustrating for you to hear me talk like you're invisible.
It is.
It is.
Step three:
I build a rapport.
You know, I love the color scheme in your home.
I feel like you're saying that just to build a rapport with me.
Wow, that's very observant.
Very wise.
Oh, well, thank you.
Nice.
This ain't my first rodeo.
Marge, right now
I bet you wish you were just back home in your kitchen.
I am back home in my kitchen!
Then life is good.
Am I right?
Mm-hmm.
You are.
While I'm here, could I also fix your icemaker?
Yes.
Oh, yes.
Blake, I adore you.
Shh.
It's over now.
Go get some rest.
Hmm.
Homer, can we throw the ball around?
Oh, um...
By "we," I mean me and your chore monkey.
Oh, of course!
Sure, buddy.
For you I'll get one without a criminal record.
Which means I'll have to use Choremonkey Gold.
Good one, Bart.
Wait, are you Heisman Trophy-winner Matt Leinart?
Yep, I am.
And you need this job?
Yeah, I haven't really been smart with my money after football.
But what about your broadcasting work?
Uh, sunk it all into my Thai-Irish fusion restaurant,
Shamrock Spice.
On the plus side, he taught me how to throw a perfect spiral.
Yes!
Frozen rope, kiddo!
Aw, love you, man.
Ah, I love you.
Maybe I should play a little catch with my son now.
Whatever, Hoss, let's see what you got.
My zinnias!
Annuals.
Wait, please, just let me try again.
Dad, you're embarrassing me in front of Matt Leinart.
But...
Wow.
You made that for me?
No, it used to be O.J.'s.
Yeah, Little Juice.
Oh, stupid Choremonkey.
Another thing I overdo bites me in the butt.
Uh-oh.
You're late.
There's no specified time, sir.
And you did receive progress alerts.
Whatever, fine.
Just throw the damn ball.
So, how was your day?
Pretty good.
I've thrown various balls with six different middle-aged men.
All right, stop talking, you're ruining it.
Nice pass, sir.
For someone your age.
Ju...
This isn't fun at all.
- I'm done.
- Fine.
You know the monkeys also rate the customers.
Now everyone will know what kind of man you are.
Good-bye, Tyler.
Jerk.
"Jerk." Bart used to call me that.
Be Careful Dad.
Being careful is not going to get us on America's Funniest Home Videos.
Now, when I nod, you pull the bottom brick out and the wall falls on me.
Then call Vin Di Bona Productions, then an ambulance.
Wait.
Won't they know this video is fake?
Why would I be filming you making a wall?
Why didn't you bring these things up at the production meeting?
Well, it's too late now!
Oh, great!
Dad, can I get you one of my children's Xanax?
What I need is that $10,000 prize.
Not $5,000.
I already spent that on bricks.
Now pull that rope.
If I pull the rope and it kills you,
I'll need a lot of therapy.
I'm not gonna die, son.
Uh, but if I do, can you play "Nobody Does It Better"
at my funeral on the recorder?
I can't be a part of this.
Yeah, yeah, you're right.
Thud!
Luann, help!
I'm in a hurry.
Well, at least I got it on video.
Delete.
Ah, come on.
Haw-haw!
Dad, it's me.
What are you doing here?
It's not pudding day.
My son doesn't want to be with me anymore.
So you realize that's how you've treated me all these years and you've come to apologize.
Look, Dad, I would visit more if I hadn't put you in such a depressing place.
Whatever.
I've got a real problem here.
I'm gonna be a father again!
My girlfriend's pregnant.
That's insane!
I leave you alone for six months and this is what happens?
How did you even meet her?
Oh, this home just got the Internet and everyone's using senior dating sites.
Gray Date, friends with Social Security Benefits.
Everyone's making whoopee and hanky-panky.
A few are even having sex.
You can't leave me.
We started a puzzle together.
My heart's bleeding.
Seriously.
Please call 911.
Abraham Simpson.
Are you skipping town on me?
No, no.
I like you.
It's the baby I'm skipping town on.
You don't want our baby?
Before you judge me, look where my DNA leads.
I'm fine.
Hmm.
I think he's sweet.
Would he like to play with my keys?
I am a normal person, and yes.
All right, I'll man up.
But remember, men of my generation don't change a diaper, attend a birth, or talk to the child before he's drafted.
I couldn't ask for more.
I thought you just rolled.
Those were my knees.
Rent six dollars?
!
You can't even buy a Monopoly set for that.
Great commentary, Bart.
Love you, man.
I love you.
Hi, I'm Matt.
Milhouse.
I'm Bart's best friend.
Aw, sounds like someone wants an autograph.
I do.
Who are you?
I misspelled my name.
But that makes it worth more.
Come on, Leinart, get your head in the game.
Bart, I got a straight up swap.
How 'bout I give you Boardwalk and Park Place, and you give me Ventnor?
That's crazy talk.
Oh, yeah?
What "History of Board Games" class did you take when you were in college?
My friend, you have a deal.
You got Chance.
"Take a walk on the Boardwalk,"
which I now own, and you're bankrupt and I win.
Wow, you beat me at every game, even Heisman Trophy Trivial Pursuit.
Oh!
Can I play Bart next?
I carry my own little top hat with me.
Oh.
Is this guy bothering you, Bart?
I'll make sure he finds the door.
Could you throw me out in a perfect spiral?
I can walk you out in a straight line.
Wow!
No one's gonna believe that at school.
Huh?
"Always let him win"?
"Don't let him see this sheet"?
He called me the greatest receiver he'd ever thrown to.
Was that a lie, too?
Get out there.
Hey, Mr. Simpson.
Hey, Milk Dud.
Uh, listen, I got to go change the oil in my car.
Don't you want to get a Choremonkey?
They cut me off.
I never dreamed when I gave 'em my credit card number that they would charge me.
You could help me out if you want.
I have an old shirt you could wear.
An old shirt!
Wow!
My dad doesn't have any of those.
Wow.
Anyone ever tell you that you're excellent at gluing?
Um, no.
And your rubber cement boogers were very convincing.
Look, I know you're doing this because you have to.
How would you like it if the other team had just let you win all the time?
That would have been really great.
Listen, I have another Choremonkey job.
I'll see you around.
Huh?
Huh.
Hmm.
Wait, I don't think a bouncer throws people into a bar.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You just bounce, all right?
I'll tell you which way.
Get in there.
Ralph.
Yay!
I'm a touchdown.
Boop!
Look who's a greasy guy!
Now you're greasy, too!
Look at you.
Bloop, bloop.
Well, hello, Tony Stark.
We've never had fun like that in my whole life.
Oh, look!
The engine block pizza is almost done.
Engine block pizza?
Car food is our thing.
Careful you don't burn your mouth.
Oh.
He never warns me.
For his approach here at the fifth on St Andrews.
My zombies have got you now.
Mm.
What's the matter?
Aren't you into the game?
Uh, yeah, yeah.
Good luck with that zombie Bing Crosby!
B-B-Brains.
Eh, I won.
Whoo-hoo.
Huh?
Didn't seem like you were too excited when you sliced me in half.
It's just hard when you think you're gonna be slicing the same boy in half all your life.
Uh-huh...
Well, I guess I'd better get to work.
On a Friday?
Why are you wearing a fishing hat?
Are you going fishing without me?

No.
Don't you Choremonkey me!
Sweetie, you know I'm no good at arguments, so I brought in a professional.
Hello, ma'am, my name's Blake, and I'm a retired FBI hostage negotiator.
I wouldn't say this is a hostage situation.
Mm, no one said it was, ma'am.
I'm just here to listen.
So that was step one:
listening.
Next, empathy.
I'm standing right here, you know.
Mm, it must be frustrating for you to hear me talk like you're invisible.
It is.
It is.
Step Three:
I build a rapport.
You know, I love the color scheme in your home.
I feel like you're saying that just to build a rapport with me.
Wow, that's very observant.
Very wise.
Oh, well, thank you.
Nice.
This ain't my first rodeo.
Marge, right now
I bet you wish you were just back home in your kitchen.
I am back home in my kitchen!
Then life is good.
Am I right?
Mm-hmm.
You are.
While I'm here, could I also fix your icemaker?
Yes.
Oh, yes.
Blake, I adore you.
Shh.
It's over now.
Go get some rest.
Hmm.
Homer, can we throw the ball around?
Oh, um...
By "we," I mean me and your chore monkey.
Oh, of course!
Sure, buddy.
For you I'll get one without a criminal record.
Which means I'll have to use Choremonkey Gold.
Good one, Bart.
Wait, are you Heisman Trophy-winner Matt Leinart?
Yep, I am.
And you need this job?
Yeah, I haven't really been smart with my money after football.
But what about your broadcasting work?
Uh, sunk it all into my Thai-Irish fusion restaurant,
Shamrock Spice.
On the plus side, he taught me how to throw a perfect spiral.
Yes!
Frozen rope, kiddo!
Aw, love you, man.
Ah, I love you.
Maybe I should play a little catch with my son now.
Whatever, Hoss, let's see what you got.
My zinnias!
Annuals.
Wait, please, just let me try again.
Dad, you're embarrassing me in front of Matt Leinart.
- But...
- Wow.
You made that for me?
No, it used to be O.J.'s.
Yeah, Little Juice.
Oh, stupid Choremonkey.
Another thing I overdo bites me in the butt.
Uh-oh.
You're late.
There's no specified time, sir.
And you did receive progress alerts.
Whatever, fine.
Just throw the damn ball.
- So, how was your day?
- Pretty good.
I've thrown various balls with six different middle-aged men.
All right, stop talking, you're ruining it.
Nice pass, sir.
For someone your age.
Ju...
This isn't fun at all.
- I'm done.
- Fine.
You know the monkeys also rate the customers.
Now everyone will know what kind of man you are.
Good-bye, Tyler.
Jerk.
"Jerk." Bart used to call me that.
Be careful, Dad.
Being careful is not going to get us on America's Funniest Home Videos.
Now, when I nod, you pull the bottom brick out and the wall falls on me.
Then call Vin Di Bona Productions, then an ambulance.
Wait.
Won't they know this video is fake?
Why would I be filming you making a wall?
Why didn't you bring these things up at the production meeting?
Well, it's too late now!
Oh, great!
Dad, can I get you one of my children's Xanax?
What I need is that $10,000 prize.
Not $5,000.
I already spent that on bricks.
Now pull that rope.
If I pull the rope and it kills you,
I'll need a lot of therapy.
I'm not gonna die, son.
Uh, but if I do, can you play "Nobody Does It Better"
at my funeral on the recorder?
I can't be a part of this.
Yeah, yeah, you're right.
Luann, help!
I'm in a hurry.
Well, at least I got it on video.
Delete.
Ah, come on.
Haw-haw!
Dad, it's me.
What are you doing here?
It's not pudding day.
My son doesn't want to be with me anymore.
So you realize that's how you've treated me all these years and you've come to apologize.
Look, Dad, I would visit more if I hadn't put you in such a depressing place.
Whatever.
I've got a real problem here.
I'm gonna be a father again!
My girlfriend's pregnant.
That's insane!
I leave you alone for six months and this is what happens?
How did you even meet her?
Oh, this home just got the Internet and everyone's using senior dating sites.
Gray Date,
Friends with Social Security Benefits.
Everyone's making whoopee and hanky-panky.
A few are even having sex.
You can't leave me.
We started a puzzle together.
My heart's bleeding.
Seriously.
Please call 911.
Abraham Simpson.
Are you skipping town on me?
No, no.
I like you.
It's the baby I'm skipping town on.
You don't want our baby?
Before you judge me, look where my DNA leads.
I'm fine.
Hmm.
I think he's sweet.
Would he like to play with my keys?
I am a normal person, and yes.
All right, I'll man up.
But remember, men of my generation don't change a diaper, attend a birth, or talk to the child before he's drafted.
I couldn't ask for more.
I thought you just rolled.
Those were my knees.
Rent six dollars?
!
You can't even buy a Monopoly set for that.
Great commentary, Bart.
Love you, man.
I love you.
Hi, I'm Matt.
Milhouse.
I'm Bart's best friend.
Aw, sounds like someone wants an autograph.
I do.
Who are you?
I misspelled my name.
But that makes it worth more.
Come on, Leinart, get your head in the game.
Bart, I got a straight up swap.
How 'bout I give you Boardwalk and Park Place, and you give me Ventnor?
That's crazy talk.
Oh, yeah?
What "History of Board Games" class did you take when you were in college?
My friend, you have a deal.
You got Chance.
"Take a walk on the Boardwalk,"
which I now own, and you're bankrupt and I win.
Wow, you beat me at every game, even Heisman Trophy Trivial Pursuit.
Oh!
Can I play Bart next?
I carry my own little top hat with me.
Oh.
Is this guy bothering you, Bart?
I'll make sure he finds the door.
Could you throw me out in a perfect spiral?
I can walk you out in a straight line.
Wow!
No one's gonna believe that at school.
Huh?
"Always let him win"?
"Don't let him see this sheet"?
He called me the greatest receiver he'd ever thrown to.
Was that a lie, too?
Get out there.
Hey, Mr. Simpson.
Hey, Milk Dud.
Uh, listen, I got to go change the oil in my car.
Don't you want to get a Choremonkey?
They cut me off.
I never dreamed when I gave 'em my credit card number that they would charge me.
You could help me out if you want.
I have an old shirt you could wear.
An old shirt!
Wow!
My dad doesn't have any of those.
Wow.
Anyone ever tell you that you're excellent at gluing?
Um, no.
And your rubber cement boogers were very convincing.
Look, I know you're doing this because you have to.
How would you like it if the other team had just let you win all the time?
That would have been really great.
Listen, I have another Choremonkey job.
I'll see you around.
Huh?
Huh.
Hmm.
Wait, I don't think a bouncer throws people into a bar.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You just bounce, all right?
I'll tell you which way.
Get in there.
Ralph.
Yay!
I'm a touchdown.
Boop!
Look who's a greasy guy!
Now you're greasy, too!
Look at you.
Bloop, bloop.
Well, hello, Tony Stark.
We've never had fun like that in my whole life.
Oh, look!
The engine block pizza is almost done.
Engine block pizza?
Car food is our thing.
Careful you don't burn your mouth.
Oh.
He never warns me.
Vijay Singh has chosen a seven iron for his approach here at the fifth on St Andrews.
My zombies have got you now.
Mm.
What's the matter?
Aren't you into the game?
Uh, yeah, yeah.
Good luck with that zombie Bing Crosby!
B-B-Brains.
Eh, I won.
Whoo-hoo.
Huh?
Didn't seem like you were too excited when you sliced me in half.
It's just hard when you think you're gonna be slicing the same boy in half all your life.
Uh-huh...
Well, I guess I'd better get to work.
On a Friday?
Why are you wearing a fishing hat?
Are you going fishing without me?
What is happening with us?
If you've got something to say, just say it.
Unless it's boring.
Is there someone else?
Oh!
Spare me your melodramata!
Marge, I can't have a baby.
Coordinating our sleep schedules will be a nightmare.
Plus, the only good relationship I ever had was with my hat.
Then the wind blew it away.
You didn't have a good relationship with your father?
Hmm.
Come here, sweet pea, give me a burp.
Youse can do it.
Aah!
Youse got milk on me!
I'll murdalize ya!
Oh... that was before throwing' your baby into the sun was considered child abuse.
So you see, Simpson men just don't...
Wait a minute!
Now yank the hook out and throw him back because we're humane.
I've never seen Homer and Bart so close.
Maybe I can finally be a good dad!
That's not Bart.
Don't ruin my epiphany!
Hey, Mr. Van Houten.
- Oh, hey, Bart. Milhouse isn't here.
- I know.
And I don't care.
Are you making envelope soup?
Envelope soup?
That'd be silly.
No, I'm stamp mining.
You steam off the stamp, color in the postmark, and you just made half a dollar.
Almost.
Want to try?
Careful!
That's a forever stamp!
Could be worth a fortune some day.
Well done.
And look at me.
I'm hangin' out with Bart Simpson.
That's so cool.
I can't wait till Wendell sees us hangin' out.
Oh, hey.
Oh, I built it up too much.

Oh, hi, Marge.
Homer, why were you fishing with Milhouse?
Because for once, I'm with a kid who respects me.
One who doesn't call me "Homer."
I didn't know that bothered you.
It does.
A lot.
Oh, Homer.
Feels good when you say it.
Homer.
Ah...
Honey, maybe you should talk to Bart.
He's just behind that wall.
Yeah, Homer!
Get your fat ass over here!
You see?
You see?
!
It's not bad enough he calls me "Homer."
He calls my buttocks "ass."
Hmm.
He probably learned that at school.
You bet your ass he did.
Maybe you and Lisa can talk to him.
Lisa and I aren't speaking right now.
I can't believe you threw away my Utne Readers!
Oh, is that how you pronounce it?
Aah!
For most of my child's life, I'll be gone.
When you're cremated, you feel it!
Warn everyone!
Aah.
Oh, Abe, hi.
I-I was about to call you.
I had an ultrasound today.
But...
Does this mean...?
Yup, I'm the father.
And I thought she was just using me for a beard.
I'm so sorry, Abe.
Well, I just want to say...
Yes!
I can't raise my left arm, much less a child!
Yippee!
Not having kids keeps you young!
Oh, I knew you'd come back!
- Kirk.

- Dad.

That is not my name!
Mm, mm, mm!
Let's roll.
Can't let 'em catch us.
I can't take the pressure!
Son, I'm so sorry!
I'm getting rid of this stupid stop sign before it hurts somebody else!
I'm sorry, too, Dad.
You called me Dad!
There's a first time for everything.
Also, a last.
Milhouse, I'd be lying if I said riding in a go-cart with Bart Simpson wasn't the highlight of my life, but you're my son and I love you.
I love you, too, Dad.
You're my favorite guy that Mom's brought home.
Aw...
Last one home is a rotten father!
Those aren't yours to keep!
They take them out of our pay!
We'll bring them back when we get tired of them!
Oh, that never happens.
But, Chief, I...
I don't think those vehicles are certified for highway use.
Yeah, well, I don't think you're certified to understand the relationship between a father and son, Lou.
Yeah, well, I have a son...
He lives in Baltimore.
What do you want, a parade, Lou?
Listen, Maggie...
Can I call you Maggie?
...
Is there a way I can get you to put that pacifier down?
Oh, don't worry.
I'll be here as long as it takes.
You know, if you cooperate,
I can talk to your mother about a reduced time out.
Look, you wanted a helicopter,
I got you a helicopter.
Okay, I've got your nose, and if you want to see your nose again, you'll give me that pacifier!

Um, are you sure that we can return this?
I mean, it's, like, three years old and, you know,
I didn't buy it here.
Doesn't matter.
Trust me.
My Grandma Tanita turned saving money into an art form.
She returned a doctor's appointment once.
I literally don't even know how.
- Wow.
- Mhm.
Just, it seems like a lot of work when we could just go to that other store and buy a jacket that has a zipper that works.
No, Matt, that is why you have money problems.
Look, if we are going to build a life together, you're going to have to change how you handle your finances.
It's like every time you get money you just spend it.
Okay, well, that's not fair.
I spend money that I don't have, too.
- Well.
- Next.
- Oh.
- Uh...
Just watch and learn.
Hello.
Oh, sorry, I got so distracted by your beautiful eyes.
Thank you.
One of them's glass.
That explains the sparkle.
Anyway, I'd like to return this jacket.
It's defective.
Okay, do you have the receipt?
No.
- (laughing nervously):
No.
- We don't...
I mean it's just so weird that we're here, because... so...
- Next.
- Matt.
We know for a fact that they carry this brand here and they definitely stand behind all of their merchandise.
That's why we shop here.
Right, Leigh?
It's pronounced Lekh.
Le-ukh?
It's beautiful.
Do you think that you could help us, Le-ukh?
LEIGH:
You know what?
I am charmed by your use of my name.
Let me go talk to my manager.
Thank you.
Okay, I am so uncomfortable.
Why?
Because you have all this sexual energy and you just want to attack me right now?
No, I don't... wait, what?
What?
What?
(groans)
Does saving money turn you on?
Why do you think I get so revved up when we're watching Cinemax?
Because it's gentle lady porn.
Oh, no.
It's because our neighbors are paying for it.

MATT:
Babe,
I found some dirty Ziploc bags at work to bring home and wash out.
Look at that.
Huh?
A galloner.
Big dog.
What's wrong?
Oh, no.
Big Lots discovered our double coupon scam.
No, it's not that, no.
I missed my period.
I'm late.
That's bigger than Big Lots.
Yes.
All right.
Stay calm.
Okay.
You stay here and relax.
I'm going to go to the store, get a pregnancy test, you know.
No need for us to freak out.
Whew, okay.
Unless we know what we're freaking out about.
Might want to do your pants up.
- Yep.
- Okay.
I'm freaking out.
We were always so careful.
Except for sometimes when we weren't.
Maybe it's wrong, tests can be wrong.
Here, take another one...
I bought a ton of them.
There was a special at the dollar store.
They were a dollar.
Matt, you bought pregnancy tests at the dollar store?
Yeah, I'm not going to spend a ton of money on something you're just going to pee on.
Everybody knows there are two things you never buy at the dollar store:
pregnancy tests and crab.
Oh.
I saw that.
So expensive, full-price test results are...?
- Not pregnant.
- Oh, thank God.
And not that I don't want to have many babies with you some day.
Totally, some day.
But babies are expensive.
Which reminds me,
I think you should return those pregnancy tests.
I only peed on one.
Mmm-hmm.
Uh, maybe we should hold onto them, because I bought our condoms at the dollar store, too.
60 for a dollar.
_
Okay, so at 10:30 you have Mrs. Barnett for...
Tim, that's for charity.
It's not a tip jar.
SYLVIE:
Oh, Dr. Hughes,
I got the acne medication for your son.
- Thank you...
- That's for Tim's back.
Heather!
Oh, you have bacne?
Yeah, it flares up when he wears his jammie dress.
It's a nightshirt.
Can you give us a second?
Okay.
Please do not discuss my personal business with the staff.
You keep doing that.
Oh, chill out.
You told everybody how nervous I was for my first day here.
That's not the same as bacne.
Sylvie idolizes me.
I'm like a father figure to her and she has a crush on me, as does everybody else in this place.
Look, just stop embarrassing me.
You want me to stop embarrassing you?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
Because you have food stains on the back of your lab coat.
That's because I turn it around when I eat ribs.
All right.
I know we always said we'd be honest with each other and there's clearly a problem here that we need to discuss.
I'm not wearing lipstick.
It's tinted lip balm.
You should try it before you rail on me.
No.
This is about the problem that you have with Heather.
I am not going to stand in your way if you want to fire her.
No, she's great.
She's the best receptionist we've ever had.
All right, look, I can read between the lines.
You want her gone by the end of the day.
That's fine.
Just make sure she knows it was you.
You want to fire your wife?
Hmm.
Well, I hadn't thought about it, but now that you bring it up, yes, I want it more than anything in life.
Hi.
- About earlier,
- Yeah.
I thought that there's a bigger issue here that we kind of need to talk about.
Oh, I agree.
I-I am not happy with the way things are going.
Yeah, me, neither.
And I've been thinking we really need to make a change.
So...
TIM:
Well, she's no longer our receptionist.
Well done, Tim.
Oh, hey, guys.
Loving my new parking spot.
I'm going to go see if I can fit a water feature into my new office.
You promoted her?
- Yeah.
- You were supposed to fire her.
On her first day as office coordinator?
Oh, that's harsh.
But it needs to be done, and as her husband it might as well come from me.
I'm sorry, Heather, but you're fired...
Is what I want you to say.
But you're HR for the medical group, so feel free to make it your own.
Thank you, I love how creative my job is.
We'll give her a call first thing tomorrow.
Good, that'll give me a chance to take her out tonight to soften the blow.
You won't promote her, right?
Because I hear that sort of thing happens sometimes, which is crazy.
I got to say, this is so nice.
Only the best for my bride.
You mean your office coordinator.
- Mmm.
- I got to tell you, babe,
I did not see that coming.
Yeah, one day you're up, the next you're down.
None of it really matters as long as you have
- a life as rich as ours...
- Yeah.
outside of work.
That's the good stuff.
Oh, that is so sweet.
Listen, we should talk.
I'm so happy to be back, you know, out there in the work force.
I just...
I'm not sure that your office is the right fit for me.
Wait, are you quitting?
Yes, I'm so sorry...
I love you so much, honey, and I think we're such a great couple at home and I don't want to risk losing any of that magic that we have
- in our marriage by spending...
- Spending too much time together!
- Yes!
- I feel the same way.
Oh, my God, you do?
God, Tim, we are so in sync.
We are just...
That is why we are the envy of all of our friends.
Ah.
Wait a minute.
If you felt that way, why didn't you say anything to me?
Well, I just knew how much you loved the job and the last thing I wanted to do was hurt your feelings.
Oh, honey, that is so sweet.
(cell phone ringing) I thought I shut that off.
That touches my heart that you...
Oh, it's HR.
- HR?
- You know what?
I didn't turn in my timecard yesterday.
Give it to me, they're not supposed to call tonight.
Hi, Matilda.
She's quitting.
- Hey, she quit!
- Okay.
- Oh!
- What's wrong with you?
Oh.
Oh, okay, okay.
Can we get a box?
It's... no, thank you for calling and telling me.
- Yeah.
- Checking my phone.
That's nice.
I just got fired.
What?
No!
Why?
Did you fire me, Tim?
What?
No!
Oh, Tim.
Well, I...
Oh!
Okay, I admit this was handled poorly.
You think?
I knew that you just, you know, you wanted to preserve the magic of the marriage.
Okay, well, actually, you didn't know that.
- Okay, I didn't know that.
- No.
But look, I felt the same way, so it's perfect.
I solved our problem.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
You solved that problem.
Now you have a new problem.
Hey... well, ha-ha to you.
You can take my wallet, but I still have the valet ticket.
Oh, no, I don't... wait, Heather!
Heather, wait!
I'm done flying forever.
Except at the indoor skydiving place that couldn't lift Daddy.
That was a hard day for me.
_
Amelia Earhart received many awards and inspired many other women with her bravery, until 1937, when she disappeared while trying to fly around the world.
Her plane was never found, but there is little doubt she crashed, probably in a volcano.
So, in conclusion, never fly in a plane or you will die.
Because Amelia was the best at flying, and now she's a skeleton in a volcano with her face frozen in horror like those poor people in Pompeii.
Thank you.
(applause)
Oh, and I made a picture, too.
JOAN:
Oh, look at that.
I have a patient who draws just like that.
Had a patient.
HEATHER:
Honey, I'm not sure that the end of your report is entirely accurate.
Yeah, lava would totally melt a skeleton.
Come on.
HEATHER:
No, I mean that that crash, that was a long time ago and planes are very, very safe now.
- Yeah?
- Safer than driving a car.
Yeah.
Well, I'm done flying forever, except at the indoor skydiving place that couldn't lift Daddy.
That was a hard day for me.
HEATHER:
Dad, come on.
Help me out.
You've been flying for years.
Tell her that there is nothing to be afraid of.
I'll talk to her.
TIM:
I mean if you rent a jumpsuit
- that's big enough for a customer...
- I know, sweetie.
the thing should be able to lift him.
Hey, you were wronged.
You were wronged that day.
You said you were taking me to Costco to buy a motorcycle.
- What?
Did I say that?
- Mmm-hmm.
The truth is I want you to see the inside of a real airplane, you know, for your report.
After we prime the engine here... we yell, "Clear prop!", and then we just turn this key.
(engine starts)
You said we were just looking at switches.
- Did I say that?
- Yeah.
I just want you to see how fun it is to roll down the runway.
We're staying on the runway, right?
Sure are.
You just said we were staying on the runway.
- Oh, did I say that?
- Yeah!
I just want to take you up and do a quick barrel roll.
(Sophia screaming)
See, you don't have to be scared, sweetheart.
All planes glide nice and easy like those seagulls there.
They do look like they're having fun.
And so are we.
(clunking noise, screaming)
You hit one!
He hit us.
You're not supposed to divert from your flight path like that.
He's a bird.
He's a dodo bird.
(engine falters and stops)
Why did that stop spinning?
Don't we need that?
Uh, I just turned it off for a second so you could hear how nice and quiet it sounds at 6,000, 5,000, 4,000...
I think I'll turn it right back on now.
(engine struggling)
Okay, now you can hear the fancy code that pilots use when they talk to the tower.
Mayday, mayday.
Doesn't mayday mean there's something wrong?
Oh, no, if something was wrong
I would say, uh, "Foam the runway.
"Foam the runway.
Charlie 408, we're experiencing engine failure."
We don't have an engine?
Sure we do.
We got an engine right here.
We don't have an engine.
Are we going to die?
!
No!
Because we have an engine.
(engine struggling)
Damn it.
Mayday, mayday.
November Charlie 408.
We'd like to declare an emergency.
Get those trucks on standby and some ice cream.
The ground is coming up really fast, Pop-Pop.
Which is good.
That's where we want to be, right?
Hey, let's make sure that seatbelt is nice and snug, but not too snug, so you can loosen it in case we catch on fire.
Fire?
(moans)
JOHN:
Okay, now, hold on.
(rubber squealing)
(gasps)
(sighs)
Ground, this is November Charlie 408.
How are we doing with that ice cream?
I know what you were doing up there.
Huh?
You made it seem like we were going to die so that I could see that planes can always land no matter how bad things get.
And it worked.
I'm not afraid to fly anymore.
Thank you, Pop-Pop.
Yeah, you know what?
I think I'm going to check that tire pressure real quick.

I got the camera, I just need you to tell me, which filter do you want,
Polaroid Transfer, Unfinished Basement, or Grainy in Paris.
Yeah, I don't know what you're saying, but no.
No, got it.

Sorry, sorry, sorry...
hold on, I'm sorry.
No, something doesn't feel right.
What is wrong with this picture?
Yeah, I know, I know.
You're absolutely right.
You know, we thought that that short hair would look chic, but she looks like garbage.
No.
No, this just, this feels very sad.
Us alone, nobody else here to celebrate her big moment.
She's going to look back on this picture and just think that, like, her birthday was a bummer.
Okay, all right.
So how can we fix this?
Maybe we should invite...
Uh, family?
Family.
Your family?
Because your family is on a boat in Nova Scotia.
Nova Scotia, yeah.
According to their last ham radio broadcast.
Yeah, I realize that.
So that really only leaves.
(struggling):
Don't make me say it.
Happy birthday, baby!
Oh, I had to cancel my book club, but that's okay, because I'm so tired of those bitches anyway.
At least some of them are starting to die off.
Well, we're so happy you guys could all come last-minute.
Yeah, I didn't get to finish my round, but they'd already asked me to leave the course, so it worked out.
Well, now that we're all here and Lark's in a good mood, why don't we gather around the table and do the cake?
I'll go get the camera.
Actually can you hold off on the cake for just a few minutes?
Clemmie and I planned a little birthday performance for Lark.
CLEMENTINE:
Yeah, and we find that people tend to leave mid-song unless they're waiting around for something good.
Okay.
Okay, got the camera.
Put the camera down, Greg.
Okay.

Just wanted to thank you again for inviting us last-minute.
- And this, this is for Lark.

A beautiful rose...
- for a beautiful one-year-old girl.
- How beautiful.
- Yeah, it's fresh from our garden.
- Mhm.
Ah.
Or from the gas station on the way here.
Yeah.
Should we do the cake?
- Let's do the... and the camera.
- And the camera.
Yes.
Let me get the camera ready.
WOMAN (knocks at door):
Hello!
Where's the birthday girl or groom?
Not sure what this is.
Vicky, come on in.
Hey, guys.
This is my present to Lark, a real, live princess.
Dad?
What is going on?
Well, Vicky is the drink cart girl at the club.
I asked her what she did on the side for extra money, and she said this.
John, why would you ask her that?
I was just making conversation.
Why does anyone ask anybody anything?
Oh, I have a pair of those.
Well, now you have two.
Hey, let's get the picture thing going, right?
While Lark's still in a good mood?
I got the camera... guys, let's all gather round, take a photo with Lark, okay?
(crying)
JEN:
Oh, no, no, no no, no, no, no, no.
- No, she's crying.
- Guys, I think she's teething.
Oh, give her to me.
I've got a great remedy for teething.
- Really?
- Yes, I do.
I'll bring her right back.
Okay, I'm going to get the cake.
Yeah, I got the camera, I just need you to tell me, which filter do you want?
I got Polaroid Transfer, Unfinished Basement, or Grainy in Paris.
I don't know what you're saying, but no.
No, got it.
- You know, I wish we had had...
- Yeah.
these kind of parties with our kids, just the family and Vicky.
HEATHER (slurring):
Vicky's the best.
Hey, can I hire you to follow me around all the time?
It's $100 an hour, 200 if I'm topless,
- 300 if you want me to...
- Okay, yeah, we're going, okay...
Let's hear her rates.
HEATHER:
No, we're good.
I'm going to just take that, thank you.
JEN:
Joan, what did you do?
She's, like, unconscious.
Oh, I just rubbed a little whiskey on her gums.
You did what?
Yeah, it always works like a charm.
(stammering):
But you...
You gave her alcohol?
JOHN:
Oh, sure.
My mom used to rub whiskey on my gums when I was a baby, and it had no effect on me.
Vicky, this was supposed to be a double.
Mom?
I mean she's, like, blackout drunk.
She's a little sleeping angel.
All we wanted was a photo of Lark on her first birthday.
Now she's too wasted to be in it.
No, you know what?
We're still going to get that picture come hell or high water.

But you know what?
It's not just about the picture.
It's about family.
And how that family is ruining this picture.

Um, are you sure that we can return this?
I mean, it's, like, three years old and, you know,
I didn't buy it here.
Doesn't matter.
Trust me.
My Grandma Tanita turned saving money into an art form.
She returned a doctor's appointment once.
I literally don't even know how.
- Wow.
- Mhm.
Just, it seems like a lot of work when we could just go to that other store and buy a jacket that has a zipper that works.
No, Matt, that is why you have money problems.
Look, if we are going to build a life together, you're going to have to change how you handle your finances.
It's like every time you get money you just spend it.
Okay, well, that's not fair.
I spend money that I don't have, too.
- Well.
- Next.
- Oh.
- Uh...
Just watch and learn.
Hello.
Oh, sorry, I got so distracted by your beautiful eyes.
Thank you.
One of them's glass.
That explains the sparkle.
Anyway, I'd like to return this jacket.
It's defective.
Okay, do you have the receipt?
No.
- No.
- We don't...
I mean it's just so weird that we're here, because... so...
- Next.
- Matt.
We know for a fact that they carry this brand here and they definitely stand behind all of their merchandise.
That's why we shop here.
Right, Leigh?
It's pronounced Lekh.
Le-ukh?
It's beautiful.
Do you think that you could help us, Le-ukh?
You know what?
I am charmed by your use of my name.
Let me go talk to my manager.
Thank you.
Okay, I am so uncomfortable.
Why?
Because you have all this sexual energy and you just want to attack me right now?
No, I don't... wait, what?
What?
What?
Does saving money turn you on?
Why do you think I get so revved up when we're watching Cinemax?
Because it's gentle lady porn.
Oh, no.
It's because our neighbors are paying for it.
What else turns you on?
Babe,
I found some dirty Ziploc bags at work to bring home and wash out.
Look at that.
Huh?
A galloner.
Big dog.
What's wrong?
Oh, no.
Big Lots discovered our double coupon scam.
No, it's not that, no.
I missed my period.
I'm late.
That's bigger than Big Lots.
Yes.
All right.
Stay calm.
Okay.
You stay here and relax.
I'm going to go to the store, get a pregnancy test, you know.
No need for us to freak out.
Whew, okay.
Unless we know what we're freaking out about.
Might want to do your pants up.
- Yep.
- Okay.
I'm freaking out.
We were always so careful.
Except for sometimes when we weren't.
Maybe it's wrong, tests can be wrong.
Here, take another one...
I bought a ton of them.
There was a special at the dollar store.
They were a dollar.
Matt, you bought pregnancy tests at the dollar store?
Yeah, I'm not going to spend a ton of money on something you're just going to pee on.
Everybody knows there are two things you never buy at the dollar store:
pregnancy tests and crab.
Oh.
I saw that.
So expensive, full-price test results are...?
- Not pregnant.
- Oh, thank God.
And not that I don't want to have many babies with you some day.
Totally, some day.
But babies are expensive.
Which reminds me,
I think you should return those pregnancy tests.
I only peed on one.
Mmm-hmm.
Uh, maybe we should hold onto them, because I bought our condoms at the dollar store, too.
60 for a dollar.
_
Okay, so at 10:30 you have Mrs. Barnett for...
Tim, that's for charity.
It's not a tip jar.
Oh, Dr. Hughes,
I got the acne medication for your son.
- Thank you...
- That's for Tim's back.
Heather!
Oh, you have bacne?
Yeah, it flares up when he wears his jammie dress.
It's a nightshirt.
Can you give us a second?
Okay.
Please do not discuss my personal business with the staff.
You keep doing that.
Oh, chill out.
You told everybody how nervous I was for my first day here.
That's not the same as bacne.
Sylvie idolizes me.
I'm like a father figure to her and she has a crush on me, as does everybody else in this place.
Look, just stop embarrassing me.
You want me to stop embarrassing you?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
Because you have food stains on the back of your lab coat.
That's because I turn it around when I eat ribs.
All right.
I know we always said we'd be honest with each other and there's clearly a problem here that we need to discuss.
I'm not wearing lipstick.
It's tinted lip balm.
You should try it before you rail on me.
No.
This is about the problem that you have with Heather.
I am not going to stand in your way if you want to fire her.
No, she's great.
She's the best receptionist we've ever had.
All right, look, I can read between the lines.
You want her gone by the end of the day.
That's fine.
Just make sure she knows it was you.
You want to fire your wife?
Hmm.
Well, I hadn't thought about it, but now that you bring it up, yes, I want it more than anything in life.
Hi.
- About earlier,
- Yeah.
I thought that there's a bigger issue here that we kind of need to talk about.
Oh, I agree.
I-I am not happy with the way things are going.
Yeah, me, neither.
And I've been thinking we really need to make a change.
So...
Well, she's no longer our receptionist.
Well done, Tim.
Oh, hey, guys.
Loving my new parking spot.
I'm going to go see if I can fit a water feature into my new office.
You promoted her?
- Yeah.
- You were supposed to fire her.
On her first day as office coordinator?
Oh, that's harsh.
But it needs to be done, and as her husband it might as well come from me.
I'm sorry, Heather, but you're fired...
Is what I want you to say.
But you're HR for the medical group, so feel free to make it your own.
Thank you, I love how creative my job is.
We'll give her a call first thing tomorrow.
Good, that'll give me a chance to take her out tonight to soften the blow.
You won't promote her, right?
Because I hear that sort of thing happens sometimes, which is crazy.
I got to say, this is so nice.
Only the best for my bride.
You mean your office coordinator.
- Mmm.
- I got to tell you, babe,
I did not see that coming.
Yeah, one day you're up, the next you're down.
None of it really matters as long as you have
- a life as rich as ours...
- Yeah.
outside of work.
That's the good stuff.
Oh, that is so sweet.
Listen, we should talk.
I'm so happy to be back, you know, out there in the work force.
I just...
I'm not sure that your office is the right fit for me.
Wait, are you quitting?
Yes, I'm so sorry...
I love you so much, honey, and I think we're such a great couple at home and I don't want to risk losing any of that magic that we have
- in our marriage by spending...
- Spending too much time together!
- Yes!
- I feel the same way.
Oh, my God, you do?
God, Tim, we are so in sync.
We are just...
That is why we are the envy of all of our friends.
Ah.
Wait a minute.
If you felt that way, why didn't you say anything to me?
Well, I just knew how much you loved the job and the last thing I wanted to do was hurt your feelings.
Oh, honey, that is so sweet.
I thought I shut that off.
That touches my heart that you...
Oh, it's HR.
- HR?
- You know what?
I didn't turn in my timecard yesterday.
Give it to me, they're not supposed to call tonight.
Hi, Matilda.
She's quitting.
- Hey, she quit!
- Okay.
- Oh!
- What's wrong with you?
Oh.
Oh, okay, okay.
Can we get a box?
It's... no, thank you for calling and telling me.
- Yeah.
- Checking my phone.
That's nice.
I just got fired.
What?
No!
Why?
Did you fire me, Tim?
What?
No!
Oh, Tim.
Well, I...
Oh!
Okay, I admit this was handled poorly.
You think?
I knew that you just, you know, you wanted to preserve the magic of the marriage.
Okay, well, actually, you didn't know that.
- Okay, I didn't know that.
- No.
But look, I felt the same way, so it's perfect.
I solved our problem.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
You solved that problem.
Now you have a new problem.
Hey... well, ha-ha to you.
You can take my wallet, but I still have the valet ticket.
Oh, no, I don't... wait, Heather!
Heather, wait!
I'm done flying forever.
Except at the indoor skydiving place that couldn't lift Daddy.
That was a hard day for me.
_
Amelia Earhart received many awards and inspired many other women with her bravery, until 1937, when she disappeared while trying to fly around the world.
Her plane was never found, but there is little doubt she crashed, probably in a volcano.
So, in conclusion, never fly in a plane or you will die.
Because Amelia was the best at flying, and now she's a skeleton in a volcano with her face frozen in horror like those poor people in Pompeii.
Thank you.
Oh, and I made a picture, too.
Oh, look at that.
I have a patient who draws just like that.
Had a patient.
Honey, I'm not sure that the end of your report is entirely accurate.
Yeah, lava would totally melt a skeleton.
Come on.
No, I mean that that crash, that was a long time ago and planes are very, very safe now.
- Yeah?
- Safer than driving a car.
Yeah.
Well, I'm done flying forever, except at the indoor skydiving place that couldn't lift Daddy.
That was a hard day for me.
Dad, come on.
Help me out.
You've been flying for years.
Tell her that there is nothing to be afraid of.
I'll talk to her.
I mean if you rent a jumpsuit
- that's big enough for a customer...
- I know, sweetie.
the thing should be able to lift him.
Hey, you were wronged.
You were wronged that day.
You said you were taking me to Costco to buy a motorcycle.
- What?
Did I say that?
- Mmm-hmm.
The truth is I want you to see the inside of a real airplane, you know, for your report.
After we prime the engine here... we yell, "Clear prop!", and then we just turn this key.
You said we were just looking at switches.
- Did I say that?
- Yeah.
I just want you to see how fun it is to roll down the runway.
We're staying on the runway, right?
Sure are.
You just said we were staying on the runway.
- Oh, did I say that?
- Yeah!
I just want to take you up and do a quick barrel roll.
See, you don't have to be scared, sweetheart.
All planes glide nice and easy like those seagulls there.
They do look like they're having fun.
And so are we.
You hit one!
He hit us.
You're not supposed to divert from your flight path like that.
He's a bird.
He's a dodo bird.
Why did that stop spinning?
Don't we need that?
Uh, I just turned it off for a second so you could hear how nice and quiet it sounds at 6,000, 5,000, 4,000...
I think I'll turn it right back on now.
Okay, now you can hear the fancy code that pilots use when they talk to the tower.
Mayday, mayday.
Doesn't mayday mean there's something wrong?
Oh, no, if something was wrong
I would say, uh, "Foam the runway.
"Foam the runway.
Charlie 408, we're experiencing engine failure."
We don't have an engine?
Sure we do.
We got an engine right here.
We don't have an engine.
Are we going to die?
!
No!
Because we have an engine.
Damn it.
Mayday, mayday.
November Charlie 408.
We'd like to declare an emergency.
Get those trucks on standby and some ice cream.
The ground is coming up really fast, Pop-Pop.
Which is good.
That's where we want to be, right?
Hey, let's make sure that seatbelt is nice and snug, but not too snug, so you can loosen it in case we catch on fire.
Fire?
Okay, now, hold on.
Ground, this is November Charlie 408.
How are we doing with that ice cream?
I know what you were doing up there.
Huh?
You made it seem like we were going to die so that I could see that planes can always land no matter how bad things get.
And it worked.
I'm not afraid to fly anymore.
Thank you, Pop-Pop.
Yeah, you know what?
I think I'm going to check that tire pressure real quick.
I got the camera, I just need you to tell me, which filter do you want,
Polaroid Transfer, Unfinished Basement, or grainy in Paris.
Yeah, I don't know what you're saying, but no.
No, got it.

She's not, you know.
She's right there.
It's what she wanted.
They could've at least sprinkled her over Consti or something instead of leaving her here, gathering dust.

I just need to check a few things.
- I didn't know you were working.
- Neither did I.
- What ya doing?
- Digitising.
Digitising what?
- The White Book of Rhydderch.
- Why's it white?
The original cover was white.
Like The Beatles' White Album.
Yes, that's it.
Guess who I just met?
- Who?
- Dr Eben Prydderch.
- Right.
- You know him, don't you?
Not really.
- He's going through her things.
- He's allowed to, now that she's...
It's the library's property.
Is Glyn working tonight?
- Sure is.
- Nan fancies him.
Doesn't everyone?
He's got such a spark, hasn't he?
I'll tell him if you want.
We could swap places.
I'm happy to stay here.
See you later, palindromes.
Who's there?
Eben.
- Good night.
Thank you.
- Ta-ta.
Arrivederci.
- Bye.
- Au revoir.
Sorry, Nan.
Dan likes us, doesn't he?
He's on our side.
- We're not involving him.
- I'm just saying... saving what?
He might be the sort of person I'd consider when this is all over.
You and him?
We don't need to decide now which one of us he should be with.
- You know, I don't think...
- No.
I don't think you're suited either.
You're probably right.
Ready?
Hiya, Glyn.
I brought you a coffee.
Thanks, Nan.
I wasn't...
No need to apologise.
She looks like a nice lady, doesn't she?
Finish your coffee and maybe we can have a closer look together.
I brought you this, to keep you going.
- I don't drink coffee.
- Oh.
Alwyn and Glyn always have one.
Do I look like Alwyn or Glyn?
I'll get you some tea instead.
Tea's for old people.
- Apple juice?
- What am I, seven?
You're reading Mam's book.
Anaesthetic for dealing with Glyn.
You need a glass of wine.
There's gallons of it around, if you know where to look.
Go and get it, then.
I'll be back now, OK?
OK, boss.
Have you got any more?
Erm, yes.
Here you go.
You don't need to get me drunk.
You know that, don't you?
I often chat with Sir John.
They say he was Jack the Ripper.
That's nonsense.
I read a book about it.
He was a doctor in London, in Whitechapel.
He treated some of those women.
And?
He ripped pages out of his diary on the exact dates of the murders.
How do you know it was him?
Maybe someone else ripped them out to make him look guilty.
His knife's here somewhere.
Bet that was the Ripper's knife.
You have an over-active imagination.
You need it to work here, I can tell you.
Drink up.
What's the hurry?
Come here.
I have to go, sorry.
Hello!
Hello!
I had permission to work late tonight.
Anyone there?
Dan didn't drink all of it.
- How much?
Enough?
- Not sure.
Where is he now?
I'm a mother!
I have two little girls.
At last!
I'm not sure what you're playing at...
Why did you stick the library up here, John?
So you could get away from it all?
Trying to forget what you'd done.
Shit!
Glyn?
Glyn?
I'm meant to be checking the gallery now.
Can you let me in, please?
Don't be a twat, Glyn!
- I didn't do anything.
- Mam said it was you.
She was confused.
Why did you kill her, Eben?
She committed suicide.
The letter.
Come on, we haven't got much time.
What letter?
Ana!
All it needs is a signature.
- Come on.
- What exactly does this letter say?
- I, Eben Prydderch...
- Dr Eben Prydderch.
I, Eben Prydderch, confess to killing Elena Wdig one of our greatest writers.
To atone for this crime, I plan to take my own life.
I wouldn't kill myself in the National Library, OK?
That's not how I sign letters.
Doesn't matter.
People act out of character when they're about to die.
- It's time.
- You're right.
How would I have got hold of a gun?
Have you thought of that?
They check things like that.
Who says you're going to shoot yourself?
WHERE ARE YOU, ANA?
Get up.
- Come on, on the chair.
- No.
Do it.
The chair.
Now.
I don't want to see his face.
This won't bring her back.
Please!
I'll tell you everything, OK?
Please don't do this.
It's murder.
OK, I'll tell you everything.
Well, well, Glyndwr.
You dirty...
Come on, Matthews.
Come on.
Don't worry...
It's nothing to do with you this time.
I'll tell you everything.
Please.
You don't want to do this.
Be rational.
I'll tell you everything.
Please.
Nan?
Nan?
Where are you?
I can't find you, Nan.
Nan, just say something.
Nan?
Don't leave me, Nan.
Nan?
Nan?
Nan?
Told you that rope wasn't strong enough.
I felt something coming towards me.
I thought he was...
I shot him, didn't I?
I've messed it all up.
You and me against the world, John.
- Where's the bag?
- Don't know.
I need that bag, Ana.
Here it is.
Come on.
Eben won't get far.
Let's split up.
Check the film archive.
- I'm not sure, Nan.
- Go.
Eben.
What have you done?
We have to kill Eben.
That's why we're here.
Come on, Ana.
Leave him.
What are you doing?
He was never meant to be part of this.
It'll be easier if I do it all.
Nan!
Nan!
Nan!
Nan!
Want to tell me what the hell's going on?
I thought you were dead.
If you want to get out of something alive, better play dead.
The blood.
Slipping on the blood saved me.
Silly cow didn't even hit me.
Look.
Eben.
I shot him.
You've really stuffed things up for me.
None of this is your fault.
I only had six months probation left.
You do realise that?
Six months.
He killed Mam.
He hasn't got it in him.
He won't admit it, but we know it was him.
She told us.
Didn't she kill herself?
You're not meant to do that.
Health and Safety!
Really?
Don't laugh at me.
That's Mam's stuff!
I'm not too keen on being locked up.
Bet you've read them all.
Mam told us not to read them.
I'm sure you want to know.
Not without Nan.
Come on, pick a year.
Suit yourself, then.
I'll read them myself.
It'll pass the time, won't it?
You'd like this.
Really.
- It's about you.
- Which year?
Summer '94.
That holiday in Llansteffan.
Yes.
Read some of it.
"My first real holiday with the girls.
"My darlings running back and forth to the waves like eager mermaids."
Want me to carry on?
"I chose this life.
I chose to be their mother.
"I created them on my own so I could give them all my love."
How do you create a baby on your own?
By going to a clinic.
She didn't want a man as part of her life, she just wanted a baby.
Read something else... please.
2012?
"I see my creativity in Ana.
"It's brimming under the surface.
"Nan was born to be an archivist.
"Ana was born to create."
She thought I was wasting my life here.
We all are.
This place is important.
If no-one did the work we did...
No-one'd notice.
You lose your memory, you lose everything.
That's what Mam always said.
You don't have to save anyone.
You could do something else.
It's up to you.
There's a page missing here.
This made me cry.
What did you think of it?
Young lad comes out of prison, tries to rebuild his life.
I've heard that one before.
Do you think it's about you?
Did you mention me at all?
No skin off my nose.
I liked him.
The character.
He was a better version of me.
He was a good person, deep down.
I wrote that novel.
She told us at the end.
She said your name.
She wanted us to know it was you.
Please just let me go, Nan.
What did she say to make you so angry, Eben?
Why did you kill her?
"I went to the clinic for my treatment.
"Nothing to do now but wait to see if it will take.
"Wait to see whether being a mother will be part of my life story."
Why do you have this?
Because...
Because if I'm going to write her biography I want to tell the truth.
It's a lie.
There was no clinic.
That day she was with me.
People liked this book because Elena wrote it.
She never would have been able to write another book.
The doctor said she had early-onset dementia.
It'd be a while before it would get really bad but you can't write if you forget where your story's going.
You just can't.
There was a novel on my desk.
Something I'd been working on for months.
When she walked towards me, holding it in her hand I half hoped she'd tell me what a talent I had.
But do you know what she said?
She said "When did I write this, Ana?"
"I can publish this," she said.
"My final novel."
I couldn't tell her the truth after that.
How could I do that to my own mother?
Because you loved her.
I fooled her, Dan.
There's no-one quite like you, you know.
Keep going.
Keep going.
He's still breathing.
We need to get him out of here.
You really don't want him to die, OK.
Put him down.
I'm not afraid of you.
- Move.
- Let them go, please, Nan.
It's time to move on, isn't it?
Do what we said we'd do.
We need to leave someone behind, don't we?
We need to leave someone behind, don't we?
Who will tell them why we killed Eben?
He'll tell the world how much we loved Mam.
Won't you?
Tell them yourself.
Eben's going to die.
We did it.
It's over.
It's all over.
You go.
I'll be OK.
Thanks.
I'll take him, but I'll come back.
OK?
You're bleeding.
You shot me.
At least we know you can.
Are you ready?
We said there'd be no turning back if things went wrong.
We said there'd be no turning back if things went wrong.
Look at the state of you.
What's that?
Eben ripped it out of her diary.
Why?
- Give it back.
- Why did he rip it out?
He said that it wasn't true.
...that it wasn't true.
That he was...
Hey.
Hey!
Come on, no sleeping now, doc!
Tell me a story or something to keep you going.
I had to help her, you know.
I had to help her, you know.
I had to.
You have to help me.
I don't recognise my own work.
That last novel?
I don't even remember writing it.
I don't even remember writing it.
What will I forget next?
Don't let me turn back.
Whatever I say.
What are you doing?
This is where it starts.
Where no-one's to blame.
She wanted to control everything, even her own death.
But things aren't that simple.
But things aren't that simple.
Thank you, Eben.
Why didn't you stop her?
Maybe because for once, I felt like I was part of her life.
...for once, I felt like I was part of her life.
What am I doing?
Let me in!
Let me in!
Who are you?
Let me in!
Let me in!
Let me in!
I was one of your students.
You always said I was very promising.
I adored you.
Hung on every word you said.
I'd never met anyone quite like you.
And then, one night, you turned up at my flat.
"Why don't we go to Ynyslas to see the sunset?" That's what you said.
"Why don't we go to Ynyslas to see the sunset?" That's what you said.
Like it was the most natural thing in the world.
It was so hot that night but all the way there, I was shivering.
...but all the way there, I was shivering.
You were desperate for a child.
I didn't realise it at the time.
You didn't want me to have anything to do with them.
It was your story.
It was your story.
Your children.
He's off his head.
She used to tell us that story over and over.
How she'd gone to the clinic that day because she wanted us so badly.
How she'd gone to the clinic that day because she wanted us so badly.
Then she'd hold us tightly and tell us what miracles we were.
How she'd created us on her own.
How she'd created us on her own.
That she was a mother and father to us.
Do you remember how the story varied?
Sometimes she'd recall how she was wearing a red dress because she felt so bold.
...because she felt so bold.
Other times, she'd say it was a black dress like she was going to a funeral.
Stories change over time.
That's what happens.
Why didn't you tell them?
I don't know why she wanted to see me that day.
I hoped she'd decided to tell them about me, but she hadn't.
She never wanted them to know.
I'd remember something like that.
Who are you?
I'd remember something like that.
Who are you?
Why are you telling me this?
You can't do this to me.
I'm a mother.
I have two little girls.
I'm the only thing they...
Why didn't you save her?
Why didn't you save her?
I did save her.
I saved her by letting her die.
Of course.
Of course.
Eben.
It was Eben.
He loved me.
I chose him.
Ana and Nan.
Ana and Nan.
Perfect names for twins.
.
Mam!
.Mam?
Mam?
Mam?
Mam?
Eben.
Eben.
Eben.
It was Eben.
What if we don't know the full story?
What's the truth?
You tell me.
You and Dan?
You're just like her - you always have been.
You and your stories.
Always pretending to be someone else.
And what about me?
I could never be what she wanted me to be.
I just put things away after you.
Put your dressing-up clothes back in the chest put her diaries back on the shelf.
Made sure nothing went missing.
You and her.
You'll be together forever in that novel.
Her name on the cover and your words inside.
But I edited it.
I sent it to the publisher.
I kept the secret.
But nobody sees me.
Nobody ever sees me.
You don't need me any more.
That's the truth.
Nan!
Come on, please, Nan.
- I can't.
- I'm going to find help.
Someone asked me today what my children were called.
I couldn't remember.
What if some day I forget them completely?
Forget I'm their mother?
That would be worse than death.
Who are we, if not a reflection of those we love?
Without them, we're nothing.
A nobody.
Nan needs help!
When they come, I'll say I shot myself.
That's the story.
Nan?
Nan!
Nan!
Nan!
You'd think it was just like any other institution.
But this place houses the stories of our lives.
Not only who we were but who we thought we were.
Who we imagined we were.
No-one wants to be forgotten.
Mam wanted to leave someone behind to recount the story.
To keep her story alive.
Someone to mourn her.
To scatter her ashes.
Someone like me.
I'll recount this story my own way.
Change the narrative.
Remember things differently.
There are two sides to every story.
Sometimes, we are more than one person.
The copy and the original.
The good and the bad.
Ana and Nan.
Nan, my best creation.
My grief at its worst.
After all, every history is a fiction.
Our stories are the truth.

I'll tell Gustav and Rochelle.
Love you.
Yes, I did just say that.
You did.
I'm not sure why.
It's just one of those things you say when you're hanging up.
Yeah.
Red and I say it to each other all the time.
Okay.
I'm hanging up now.
Hey.
Love you.
Rochelle.
It's Laurel.
No blueprint, but we have a security badge.

♪ We shall not be moved ♪
♪ We will stand and fight together ♪
♪ We shall not be moved ♪
♪ Just like a tree ♪
♪ That's standing by the water ♪
It's fantastic!
Isn't it?
And it looks like it worked.
Hey, Red.
How are you doing?
Not very good, Luke.
I'm just watching you on C-SPAN.
‭
- Quite a drama.
‭
- Yes.
That's one thing I've learned from you: the voters like drama.
What do you need?
I think we should talk, you and me.
- We have talked.
‭- ‭ No, no, no, no.
Come to my office.
We'll negotiate.
Yeah?
This is me learning from you.
Compromise.
It's essential.
You want to compromise?
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Then I'll see you tomorrow.
Lunch.
Lunch.
Director.
How are you?
Not good.
Sorry to hear that.
Health issue?
Mind if I turn this on?
And I especially condemn the strong-arm tactics of the Capitol Police.
I mean, come on, now, people...
I think we should talk, Senator.
We have talked, Director.
No.
You leaked, Senator.
You were offered a CIA briefing, and you leaked.
- It's a criminal offense.
- ‭Yes, and the special prosecutor already investigated and found nothing.
I didn't leak to the press, I didn't leak to anyone.
No, the special prosecutor disappeared before he could find anything.
And what is there to find?
A witness.
‭You enjoy being a senator, sir, don't you?
But if this comes out, that you leaked, you might have to resign.
Laurel, this is Director Isenstadt from the CIA.
I don't think you've met.
- No.
- Senator,
I think we should discuss this on our own.
He was just threatening me.
I thought you should hear.
I would treat this more seriously.
He thinks I leaked the CIA briefing.
- He says he has a witness.
- When you're in a more serious frame of mind, Senator... you and I should discuss your options.
My options?
Really?
What might they be?
Good to meet you, Ms. Healy.
He's bluffing.
Says he has a witness.
_
- To you leaking?
‭
- Yeah.
Unlikely.
Unless you turn on me.
Or Dad.
Hello?
♪ Well, you might think I'm crazy ♪
Hey.
Dad?
♪ To hang around with you ♪
♪ Maybe you think I'm lucky ♪
You alright?
♪ To have something to do ♪
What do you mean?
Did you talk to the CIA about Luke?
I'm pronating too much.
I need new shoes.
They're saying they have a witness who says Luke leaked.
You were there.
I was there.
I didn't talk to the CIA, so did you?
I told them the truth.
You should try it sometime.
You're seriously gonna hurt your son?
- No, I'm gonna tell the truth.
- Oh, really?
Like the truth of how many times you screwed him over?
Come on, Laurel, this isn't personal.
His first election, his first loss, what did you tell him?
- I just wanna go running.
- You told him to never embarrass the family like that again.
- And he didn't.
- He was in tears.
You should've held him.
Why are you doing this to me?
It's not personal.
He looked up to you.
Luke wanted to be you, and you said he embarrassed you.
- I was trying to toughen him.
- No.
No, you wanted to hurt him.
You wanted to hurt him for losing.
- No, I didn't.
- That's all that ever mattered to you, just winning.
What?
Thanks for dropping by, Laurel.
Let them out.
Come back to us.
I have to go running.
You know, that was the exact moment that Luke lost his faith in you.
He admired you, everything about you, before that.
Make your son proud, Dad.
You don't have to be who you were.
I have to get cross-trainers.
So what happened?
- I was talking to my dad, and...
- Shh!
I was talking to my dad, and a bug...
- leaked out.
- ‭Why?
Why did it leak out?
I have no idea.
He grabbed his ear before any more could.
- What was he doing?
- Nothing.
We were just talking.
But, he seemed sick.
I think they're weakening.
What was he talking about?
He wasn't.
Actually, I was.
Something about telling Luke he embarrassed him after losing a Senate race.
Shame.
It's the most deep-seated human emotion.
If there's any human part of him you can still reach,
- it's through shame.
- I don't think he was ashamed.
I...
Come on, politicians can't feel ashamed.
They're just like us.
Try it, shame.
It's the thing buried deepest in the mind than anything else.
Here...
He won't go into his jacket again until tonight, so I need that back by 8:00 p.m.
This is great.
Thanks.
Yes, thank you.
No problem.
Laurel, could I talk to you for a second?
Sure.
Look, this "I love you" thing is really just
- something I said automatically.
- I know.
- I just...
- ‭Anyway, I'm the commitment-phobe, so you don't need to say anything.
What do you mean?
What don't I have to say?
Just that we shouldn't get too serious...
Do you think we're getting too serious?
No, I just...
Wait, what were you gonna say?
What?
Just-just give me a minute, okay?
I'm...
I think I love you, too.
- What?
- Forget it.
No, no.
No, seriously,
I didn't hear what you said.
Maybe I love you, too.
That's all.
If the world's gonna end, I thought I should say it.
Wait.
Just wait.
You can't just say that and... walk away.
I think I love you, too.
_
_
Blueprints?
Fine.
Just look straight, act like them,
- don't react.
- ‭Yeah.
Let's do this.
Okay.
We just have to salt the beds.
Just a few boxes in each.
- Oh, no.
Oh, no, oh, no.
‭
- Just relax.
- Just act normal.
- What are you doing?
Working.
Like you.
Just working.
See?
How unchivalrous.
Making the woman do the hard work.
Well, you know, I tried to push it, but... you know women.
I insisted.
- Here, let me.
- No, it's...
Sure.
- ‭ Oh.
‭-
Where you headed?
Uh, inside.
Uh, you know, um...
- Plot nine?
‭
- Right.
So, your name is?
Dr. Bo...
Uh,
Wheatus.
- Red Wheatus.
- ‭Senator.
It's nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you as well.
Figured I'd take a break from Capitol Hill, come on down, and see how y'all are doing.
We're doing just fine.
Almost done.
Just getting the beds in.
- It'll be a week.
I'm Brian.
- Ah.
Good, good, good.
And, um, this is my... assistant,
Roch... sheen.
Rasheen Moleen.
- Nice to meet you.
‭
- And you.
We were just...
You're just...?
Just... just... helping out.
You know, it takes a village, right?
Where are we piping the water next?
- The back nine.
- Good.
Where's that?
Come with us.
We're heading there now.
This is more disorganized than I thought it would be.
Well, we're still working out the kinks.
You might be interested in telling the senator
- your concerns.
- The senator?
Do I know you?
Hello?
Senator, we have that conference call that we need
- to get onto.
Very important.
- Ah, yes.
The call.
The call, yes.
Uh, hello.
Oh.
Oh, right.
Yes...
Yes, yes, yes!
Okay, quick thing.
Uh, yeah.
Keep it up, guys.
After you lost the first Senate race, do you remember what Dad told you?
- Sis, I'm a little busy here.
- There's a chance shame might have an impact on Dad's infection.
Is this what your friends say?
No, this is what I saw.
Well, here's the thing, Dad doesn't shame easily.
- I know.
- ‭Keep it up.
But I reminded him of the night you lost the Senate race, and... he cried.
He cried about me losing?
No, he cried about what he said to you.
- Then he had something in his eye.
‭
- No.
- No, he's still in there.
- Laurel, he was never in there to begin with.
He never was our father.
He was our... manager.
Okay, well, what else will shame him?
What else about him pisses you off?
What else did he say?
It's not about me.
It was never about me.
He always loved you.
- More than me.
- What are you talking about?
You really want to make him ashamed?
Remember that camera you got for your ninth birthday?
If anything makes him ashamed, that would.
Today is my ninth birthday, and it's the best one ever because I finally got what I wanted, a camera.
Zoom in.
Zoom out.
- Zoom in.
Zoom out.
- What's this?
- This is the movie of my life...
- I just found it, Dad.
Remember, you bought me my first camera?
That's my mom.
- She got me these shoes.
- I missed this birthday?
You did.
Don't remember that.
I heard my dad's car.
Wait, here he comes.
Oh, brother.
Where were you?
I-I couldn't get away.
You weren't at the office.
So don't even try.
- Oh, please.
- That's enough.
How do you turn this thing off?
I'll turn it off when it's over.
- Your daughter was crying.
- Well, she'll get over it.
Will she?
You missed your daughter's birthday to be with your girlfriend.
Oh, please.
Just don't start.
- Turn it off.
- It's one thing to do it to me.
- But to her?
- She doesn't even know where I was.
She knows you weren't here!
- Please?
- Please keep your voice down?
Don't tell me what to do.
You should have been here!
You really want me to move out?
I didn't know you were there.
- I know you're lying.
It's time.
- Oh, for God's sake!
I'm done.
I love my dad.
And I did.
Dad?
Dad.
Dad, are you okay?
You've got five minutes, Red, then I'm back to our sit-in.
Whoa, whoa.
Calm down, Senator, just have a seat.
I've have been sitting for way too many hours, thanks to you.
So... what's the deal?
All right, well, if you refuse to sit, fine, but, uh, I'm a bit queasy, so... could you just s-stand still, right-right there, for a minute?
Talk.
Thank you.
Well...
Here's my offer.
Oh, come on.
Hello?
Uh, Laurel, what is it?
W-What?
No, y... yes.
Wait, when?
But how did...
Yes, I'm-I'm on my way.
Uh, we're gonna need to delay this.
Why?
W-W-What's wrong?
Uh, my dad is sick.
Damn Healys.
Do you need anything, Senator?
No.
Has anyone been in here, buddy?
In your office?
- No.
- The intern.
- What's his name?
- ‭Gary.
He hasn't been in here.
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.
Why don't you bring him in here?
No.
I'll go talk to him.
You're a good person, aren't you?
No, just a person.
No, it's not a bad thing, to be good.
You know, sometimes I...
I think you're like the son I never had.
- That's nice, Senator.
- Then sometimes I think you're not.
- Did it work?
- Yes, but no.
We have to find another way.
Okay, where's the badge?
Any day now.
Oh, oh.
Ooh, in his sock?
Yeah, it's in your sock.
Here you go.
Do you need help with that?
No.
No.
I think I can do this.
Where the hell...?
Is-is this what you're looking for...
Senator?
Yes.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well, see you tomorrow.
Just...
It's not easy... seeing him like that.
You all right?
My whole childhood, I wanted to see Dad show some kind of shame for what he did to Mom.
Now I have.
How does it feel?
Awful.
Are you serious?
It's...
Oh, it's 9:00 a.m.
I have a solution.
- Another way into the hothouse?
‭
- No.
We don't have to get into the hothouse.
They're still a week away.
Okay.
Then... what?
We need to sabotage the trees.
They're in the trees now.
We need to make them absciss.
- Absciss means...
- I know what it means.
Make them shed, make their blossoms drop before the bugs can get to the hothouses.
- And how do we do that?
‭
- Mm.
Ammonium nitrate fertilizer.
Shame?
Yes.
It worked on my dad.
The person is still in there.
He can be reached.
Yeah, Red really doesn't do shame.
It's not his brand.
Well, he was crying last week.
So you want to figure out what'll shame him?
Yes.
God, you're sexy.
Lana.
He keeps calling you Lana.
Yes.
I need your laptop.
Do you need a moment, Senator?
I just miss her, and I'm...
I'm so ashamed.
Okay, why don't we take a break, and, uh, we'll be back to discuss
- more on the congressional dysfunction.
- ‭
- Oh.
Lana.
Where are you, Lana?
I think I saw her photo in Red's drawer.
Whose?
Lana's.
So we just sprinkle some ammonium nitrate on the roots?
That's what it says.
How long does it take?
Depends on how much we use.
Hey, let's not draw a lot of attention to ourselves.
We wouldn't want...
Yup.
This is not gonna look good.
No.
Is there a problem, officer?
License and registration.
- A flickering tail light perchance?
- ‭Gustav!
Excuse my friend, officer.
Actually, you were speeding, sir.
What?
I was most definitely not speeding.
- Rochelle, you...
- You know what?
I think we should probably record this.
- Ma'am, please put the phone away.
- ‭Why would I do that?
Because you're not allowed to record an officer in D.C.
Actually, in D.C., all you need is one party's consent, so, smile.
Not when you're obstructing police business.
Ah, here we go.
- This is bad.
‭
- Don't talk.
Shh.
It makes them angry.
You've been through this before?
It's why I don't have a car.
Oh, great.
Now what?
Well, well, well.
What are the odds?
Senator Healy, may we have a word?
So, you're a united front now?
You've been getting people to steal my security badge?
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Call my office, make an appointment.
Right now, I have a floor to sit on.
We think you should stop this.
Check on your witness.
I think you'll find he's not available anymore.
It's not about your father.
"I love you, Lukey Pookie."
This is about something more serious.
There's a sex tape.
Not a good one.
Thank you.
This has been an amazing achievement.
Now I think it's time to bring this sit-in to a close.
- What?
No!
- Yes!
Yes.
We have made our point.
Now I think we should let the majority vote.
It's time.
Don't make any furtive movements.
- Excuse me, I know how to be black.
- Turn around.
What's the fertilizer for?
My friend bought a tree.
Must be a big tree.
- If you would just check my ID...
- I have it.
No, you have my driver's license.
I mean my work ID.
It's in my back pocket.
If you would just...
- Do not reach in your pocket!
‭
- Please.
Just check my back... pocket.
You work for the NSA?
Yes, sir.
I'm a senior intelligence officer.
Damn it.
Sorry to bother you, Agent Triplett.
You folks are free to leave.
Sorry about the misunderstanding.
Thank you.
You're NSA?
!
Of course.
What'd you think?
That's insane.
(classical music playing
All those in favor of allowing the budget to pass as is.
The motion is passed.
The budget will go in front of the full Senate without bifurcation.
There, you see that?
We can get things done after all.
We shall not be moved, my ass.
- Huh?
- Damn it.
Look, the sentence needs to be precise and direct.
Well, your precision won't matter
- unless we get there in time.
- Where are we?
- Almost done.
- So you didn't even bother voting?
You just let it go through?
It wouldn't have mattered.
They had the numbers.
That's why you were doing the sit-in.
- I don't understand.
- Laurel, will you please stop
- telling me how to do my job?
- Wasn't that the point?
- Can you trust me?
‭
- Sorry, I need to focus.
All motorcycle helmets are required to pass
- federal motor vehicle...
- Are you serious?
You had a motorcycle helmet bill?
Yes.
Very important.
We have the votes for it.
- Yes, Republicans, too.
- Good.
Let's go.
Wait... wait.
What are you going to do?
The trick was to make the motorcycle helmet law public health policy,
- and give it a robust advertis...
- Okay, I don't understand.
Once it's about the public health, the asterisk includes language that affects paragraph 1403,
- sub-paragraph six, footnotes 11...
- ‭Meaning?
The motorcycle helmet law overrides the farm bill on issues that cross state lines.
He lost.
He just doesn't know it yet.
What the hell?
!
"Funding for the federal motorcycle helmet law supersedes all funding for paragraph 1403..."
Gareth!
Gareth?
Ah.
Here she is.
Yes.
Here I am.
Looks like it's come down to the two of us.
Sure does.
Come on in.
Sit.
All the children have gone to bed.
It's just the adults now.
Shall we talk?
Sure.
You go first.
What I don't understand is why you didn't say anything.
You didn't say anything about your car, either.
Yes, but there is a big difference between owning a BMW, and being a senior intelligence officer with the NSA.
- Yes.
- ‭Hey, guys.
Sorry to interrupt.
Where's Laurel?
She went upstairs to find you.
To...
Your brother kind of tricked me with this helmet law.
Yes, he can be sneaky that way.
Seems to run in the family...
Lana?
What?
You were about to call me Lana, weren't you?
It doesn't matter.
We have the grassroots.
- We have the gerrymandered districts.
- You mean the crop circles.
We have everything for a permanent majority.
I look like her, don't I?
I looked online.
Except for the hair.
Maybe if I put it back?
How's that?
What are we talking about here?
Your first love.
My first love... was and is our great country.
You turned Lana in.
She was an illegal immigrant working in your dorm.
You were in love with her, but you hated the fact that you were in love with her.
This is disgusting.
You want to make everything about sex.
I didn't say anything about sex.
I said "love."
I couldn't have been in love with her.
She wasn't my type.
Then why do you keep calling me Lana?
Here's the truth.
- You're ashamed of what you did.
- I'm proud of what I did.
Then what did you do?
I turned in a woman who was in this country illegally.
She's dead now.
Did you know that?
You sent her to Guatemala.
She was born here, but her parents weren't.
- You're making this up.
- ‭No.
And you know I'm not.
Go on.
Let it out.
You know you want to.
Get it out.
You need to be...
What?
What?
Come on.
What do I need to be?
I'm Lana.
What do I need to be?
Stop.
No.
Why?
Why are you doing this?
‭I love you, Gareth.
Why are you...?
Why are you...?
My butt.
You shot me in the butt.
There it goes.
‭Hey, it's going under the door.
Get it!
Oops.
Sorry, Senator.
I'll...
I'll get some paper towels, and... clean this up.
Oh, and I got your smoothie.
For years now, we've let Republicans rule this chamber.
Well, I am sick and tired of playing second fiddle to some of these...
Senator.
Do you want to relinquish your time, Senator?
Whoa, whoa.
How long is this supposed to take?
I don't know.
Could be a day, could be a week.
Why don't you ask your NSA friends?
This is really bothering you, isn't it?
I just...
I don't understand why we've been running around with salt and fertilizer, when you could have just waved your NSA magic wand.
My NSA magic wand?
Your government connections.
Your ability to wiretap.
First of all, I do not wiretap.
Okay?
Second of all, I was on leave.
Third of all, this is only bothering you because you have a massive crush on me.
Okay.
I'm going now.
See?
You can't get enough of me.
My... magnetism.
I said, you can't get enough...
Five cherry blossoms?
That's not enough.
There needs to be more than that.
Ah, we did it!
That's kind of gross.
Hey, hey.

Okay.
38 days.
Their countdown clock said 38 days.
I knew it sounded familiar.
War. 38 days to start war.
No, the war was a distraction.
The internment camps were a distraction-- they were never for internment.
They were hothouses.
A distraction from what?
Shh!
(guitar continues playing)
(sighs):
Tsk.
Oh, God.
(knocks)
ROCHELLE:
A distraction... from what?
Cherry blossoms.
Global warming has extended the cherry blossom season, but it's ending.
In 38 days.
Right.
Well, less now.
(exhales) They need the cherry blossoms.
That's where they spawn.
That's why the hothouses.
It's not just about spreading the blossoms to other states, it's about surviving here, now.
So what do we do?
We stop the building of this hothouse.
The one in Manassas.
No, no, no, no.
It's almost done.
We need to sabotage it.
How?
We need full blueprints.
Can you get them from Red?
I'll talk to Gareth.
And what about the vote on the other hothouses?
We still need to stop them.
Right.
My brother's on it.
Nice.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
I feel like we should say something to each other.

Gareth didn't tell us he had a girlfriend.

I think we should talk, Senator.
We have talked, Director.
No.
You leaked, Senator.
You were offered a CIA briefing, and you leaked.
It's a criminal offense.
Yes, and the special prosecutor already investigated and found nothing.
I didn't leak to the press, I didn't leak to anyone.
No, the special prosecutor disappeared before he could find anything.
And what is there to find?
(chuckles)
A witness.

No.
Senator, I think we should discuss this on our own.
He was just threatening me.

I would treat this more seriously.

No, I'm gonna tell the truth.
Oh, really?

(sighs) Come on, Laurel, this isn't personal.
His first election, his first loss, what did you tell him?
I just wanna go running.
You told him to never embarrass the family like that again.
And he didn't.
He was in tears.
You should've held him.
Why are you doing this to me?
It's not personal.
He looked up to you.
Luke wanted to be you, and you said he embarrassed you.
I was trying to toughen him.
No.
No, you wanted to hurt him.
You wanted to hurt him for losing.
No, I didn't.
That's all that ever mattered to you, just winning.

Thanks for dropping by, Laurel.
Let them out.
Come back to us.
I have to go running.
You know, that was the exact moment that Luke lost his faith in you.
He admired you, everything about you, before that.
Make your son proud, Dad.
You don't have to be who you were.
I have to get cross-trainers.
So what happened?
-I was talking to my dad, and--
-Shh!
I was talking to my dad, and a bug... leaked out.
Why?
Why did it leak out?
I have no idea.
He grabbed his ear before any more could.
What was he doing?
Nothing.
We were just talking.
But, he seemed sick.
I think they're weakening.
ROCHELLE:
What was he talking about?
He wasn't.
Actually, I was.
Something about telling Luke he embarrassed him after losing a Senate race.
Shame.
It's the most deep-seated human emotion.
If there's any human part of him you can still reach, it's through shame.
I don't think he was ashamed.
I don't...

This is great.
Thanks.

Yes, thank you.
No problem.
Laurel, could I talk to you for a second?
Sure.
Look, this "I love you" thing is really just something I said automatically.
I know.
I just...
Anyway, I'm the commitment-phobe, so you don't need to say anything.
What do you mean?
What don't I have to say?
Just that we shouldn't get too serious...
Do you think we're getting too serious?
No, I just...

That's where they spawn.
That's why the hothouses.

You leaked, Senator.
You were offered a CIA briefing, and you leaked.
It's a criminal offense.
Yes, and the special prosecutor already investigated and found nothing.
I didn't leak to the press, I didn't leak to anyone.
No, the special prosecutor disappeared before he could find anything.

A witness.

You told him to never embarrass the family like that again.
And he didn't.
He was in tears.

The trick was to make the motorcycle helmet law public health policy, and give it a robust advertis...
Okay, I don't understand.
Once it's about the public health, the asterisk includes language that affects paragraph 1403, sub-paragraph six, footnotes 11 through...
Meaning?
The motorcycle helmet law overrides the farm bill on issues that cross state lines.
He lost.
He just doesn't know it yet.
RED:
What the hell?
!
"Funding for the federal motorcycle helmet law supersedes all funding for paragraph 1403..."
(angry muttering)
(shouting):
Gareth!
Gareth?
Ah.
Here she is.
Yes.
Here I am.
Looks like it's come down to the two of us.
Sure does.
Come on in.
Sit.
All the children have gone to bed.
It's just the adults now.
Shall we talk?
Sure.
You go first.
What I don't understand is why you didn't say anything.
You didn't say anything about your car, either.
Yes, but there is a big difference between owning a BMW, and being a senior intelligence officer with the NSA.
Yes.
Hey, guys.
Sorry to interrupt.
Where's Laurel?
She went upstairs to find you.
To...
Your brother kind of tricked me with this helmet law.
Yes, he can be sneaky that way.
Seems to run in the family...
Lana?
What?
You were about to call me Lana, weren't you?
It doesn't matter.
We have the grassroots.
We have the gerrymandered districts.
You mean the crop circles.
We have everything for a permanent majority.
I look like her, don't I?
I looked online.
Except for the hair.
Maybe if I put it back?
How's that?
What are we talking about here?
Your first love.
My first love... was and is our great country.
You turned Lana in.
She was an illegal immigrant working in your dorm.
(laughing)
You were in love with her, but you hated the fact that you were in love with her.
This is disgusting.
You want to make everything about sex.
I didn't say anything about sex.
I said "love."
I couldn't have been in love with her.
She wasn't my type.
Then why do you keep calling me Lana?
Here's the truth.
You're ashamed of what you did.
I'm proud of what I did.
Then what did you do?
I turned in a woman who was in this country illegally.
She's dead now.
Did you know that?
You sent her to Guatemala.
She was born here, but her parents weren't.
You're making this up.
No.
And you know I'm not.
Go on.
Let it out.
You know you want to.
Get it out.
You need to be...
What?
What?
Come on.
What do I need to be?
I'm Lana.
What do I need to be?
(gasps) (door opens)
(glass breaking)
(grunting)
(straining):
Stop.
No.
(grunts)
Why?
(straining):
Why are you doing this?
(groans) I love you, Gareth.
Why are you...?
Why are you...?
(gunshot)
(Gareth panting)
(screaming)
My butt.
(groaning)
You shot me in the butt.
(Red grunts)
There it goes.
Hey, it's going under the door.
LAUREL:
Get it!
(crunch, squish)
Oops.
Sorry, Senator.
I'll...
I'll get some paper towels, and... clean this up.
Oh, and I got your smoothie.
(high-pitched screeching)
(screeching grows louder)
For years now, we've let Republicans rule this chamber.
Well, I am sick and tired of playing second fiddle to some of these...
(high-pitched screeching)
DIANE:
Senator.
Do you want to relinquish your time, Senator?
(high-pitched screeching)
(panicked screaming)
(high-pitched screeching)
Oh, my God.
Whoa, whoa.
♪ ♪
GUSTAV (sighs):
How long is this supposed to take?
ROCHELLE:
I don't know.
Could be a day, could be a week.
Why don't you ask your NSA friends?
This is really bothering you, isn't it?
(sighs) I just...
I don't understand why we've been running around with salt and fertilizer, when you could have just waved your NSA magic wand.
My NSA magic wand?
Your government connections.
Your ability to wiretap.
First of all, I do not wiretap.
Okay?
Second of all, I was on leave.
Third of all, this is only bothering you because you have a massive crush on me.
Okay.
I'm going now.
See?
You can't get enough of me.
My... magnetism.
I said, you can't get enough...
Five cherry blossoms?
That's not enough.
There needs to be more than that.
(rustling)
(Rochelle laughing)
(both laughing)
Ah, we did it!
(laughing)
(Rochelle squealing happily)
That's kind of gross.

I know what their plan is, and I think I know how to stop it.
Okay.
38 days.
Their countdown clock said 38 days.
- I knew it sounded familiar.
- War. 38 days to start war.
No, the war was a distraction.
The internment camps were a distraction...
They were never for internment.
- They were hothouses.
- A distraction from what?
Shh!
Tsk.
Oh, God.
A distraction... from what?
Cherry blossoms.
Global warming has extended the cherry blossom season,
- but it's ending.
- In 38 days.
Right.
Well, less now.
- They need the cherry blossoms.
- That's where they spawn.
That's why the hothouses.
It's not just about spreading the blossoms to other states, it's about surviving here, now.
- So what do we do?
- We stop the building of this hothouse.
- The one in Manassas.
- No, no, no, no.
It's almost done.
- We need to sabotage it.
- How?
We need full blueprints.
Can you get them
- from Red?
- I'll talk to Gareth.
And what about the vote on the other hothouses?
- We still need to stop them.
- Right.
My brother's on it.
Nice.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
I feel like we should say something to each other.
We're in this together.
It's us against the world.
The world won't know what hit it.
Ow.
Sorry about that.
Well!
- Look who's here.
- This is your son's girlfriend, Lana.
Laurel.
- Mr. and Mrs. Ritter, hi.
- Oh, call us Nora and Sam.
I...
Gareth didn't tell us he had a girlfriend.
- Yeah. they're in town - _ because of this terrible mugging.
It's the Democrats...
Coddling inner-city terrorists.
Uh, sorry.
- Didn't mean to offend you.
- Oh!
- You're a...
Democrat.
- Sam.
- What?
I-I didn't say anything...
- Not just a Democrat.
Her brother's the leader of the rebellion
- in the senate.
- He's your brother?
Would you do me a favor and get Senator...
There he is!
Hey, man of the hour.
We were just talking politics.
Gareth.
Oh!
‭Oh!
Sorry.
- How are you doing?
- Good, Mom.
You guys didn't need to come this far.
You got stabbed!
Of course we'd come.
- Hi.
- Hi.
We were just discussing you two.
You're a sly one, eh?
Not telling your parents you're dating a Democrat?
Especially so soon after she...
- dated Michael Moore.
‭
- What?
- Gareth.
Do you have a minute?
- Sure.
Well, that was weird.
- Yes.
It was.
- ‭Yep.
I need the blueprints for the hothouses.
What?
You have them.
No, the full things.
Can you get them?
I can try.
Are... are you good?
Yeah.
Yeah.
What do you mean?
Just, my parents, and...
I don't know what they were saying, and... they're kind of old-fashioned, and Red's kind of been a...
We could do it right here.
With your parents on the other side of the wall?
I have a lock.
- Well, in that case.
- Mm-hmm.
I have to go.
I know.
Where is everybody?
Back in their offices.
‭
- They got tired.
‭- ‭What can we do?
We need to stop these hothouses from being built.
Well...
I'm open to ideas.
What would bring the senators back?
Drama.
And what drama might that be?
You have a thought?
Eh, not a good one.
I'm open to bad ones.
Want to do me a favor?
That... depends.
Arrest me.
Oh... seriously.
And why would I do that?
This is what happens with free speech!
I'm being dragged from this floor!
This sit-in is being shut down through fascist Republican tactics!
Seriously?
Did you see what the Republicans are doing?
Can you believe it?
Is everything all right?
There's no sign of any blueprints here, but there is a security...
Do you need anything, sir?
Uh, no, Gary.
Thank you.
There is a security badge that might come in handy.
It looks like it's to the Manassas construction site.
- You're kidding.
- No.
‭
- And you won't get in trouble for this?
‭
- I hope not.
Okay.
I'll tell Gustav and Rochelle.
Love you.
Yes, I did just say that.
You did.
I'm not sure why.
It's just one of those things you say when you're hanging up.
Yeah.
Red and I say it to each other all the time.
Okay.
I'm hanging up now.
Hey.
Love you.
Rochelle.
It's Laurel.
No blueprint, but we have a security badge.

Hey, Red.
How are you doing?
Not very good, Luke.
I'm just watching you on C-SPAN.
‭
- Quite a drama.
‭
- Yes.
That's one thing I've learned from you: the voters like drama.
What do you need?
I think we should talk, you and me.
- We have talked.
‭- ‭ No, no, no, no.
Come to my office.
We'll negotiate.
Yeah?
This is me learning from you.
Compromise.
It's essential.
You want to compromise?
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Then I'll see you tomorrow.
Lunch.
Lunch.
Director.
How are you?
Not good.
Sorry to hear that.
Health issue?
Mind if I turn this on?
And I especially condemn the strong-arm tactics of the Capitol Police.
I mean, come on, now, people...
I think we should talk, Senator.
We have talked, Director.
No.
You leaked, Senator.
You were offered a CIA briefing, and you leaked.
- It's a criminal offense.
- ‭Yes, and the special prosecutor already investigated and found nothing.
I didn't leak to the press, I didn't leak to anyone.
No, the special prosecutor disappeared before he could find anything.
And what is there to find?
A witness.
‭You enjoy being a senator, sir, don't you?
But if this comes out, that you leaked, you might have to resign.
Laurel, this is Director Isenstadt from the CIA.
I don't think you've met.
- No.
- Senator,
I think we should discuss this on our own.
He was just threatening me.
I thought you should hear.
I would treat this more seriously.
He thinks I leaked the CIA briefing.
- He says he has a witness.
- When you're in a more serious frame of mind, Senator... you and I should discuss your options.
My options?
Really?
What might they be?
Good to meet you, Ms. Healy.
He's bluffing.
Says he has a witness.
_
- To you leaking?
‭
- Yeah.
Unlikely.
Unless you turn on me.
Or Dad.

Hey.
Dad?

You alright?

What do you mean?
Did you talk to the CIA about Luke?
I'm pronating too much.
I need new shoes.
They're saying they have a witness who says Luke leaked.
You were there.
I was there.
I didn't talk to the CIA, so did you?
I told them the truth.
You should try it sometime.
You're seriously gonna hurt your son?
- No, I'm gonna tell the truth.
- Oh, really?
Like the truth of how many times you screwed him over?
Come on, Laurel, this isn't personal.
His first election, his first loss, what did you tell him?
- I just wanna go running.
- You told him to never embarrass the family like that again.
- And he didn't.
- He was in tears.
You should've held him.
Why are you doing this to me?
It's not personal.
He looked up to you.
Luke wanted to be you, and you said he embarrassed you.
- I was trying to toughen him.
- No.
No, you wanted to hurt him.
You wanted to hurt him for losing.
- No, I didn't.
- That's all that ever mattered to you, just winning.
What?
Thanks for dropping by, Laurel.
Let them out.
Come back to us.
I have to go running.
You know, that was the exact moment that Luke lost his faith in you.
He admired you, everything about you, before that.
Make your son proud, Dad.
You don't have to be who you were.
I have to get cross-trainers.
So what happened?
- I was talking to my dad, and...
- Shh!
I was talking to my dad, and a bug...
- leaked out.
- ‭Why?
Why did it leak out?
I have no idea.
He grabbed his ear before any more could.
- What was he doing?
- Nothing.
We were just talking.
But, he seemed sick.
I think they're weakening.
What was he talking about?
He wasn't.
Actually, I was.
Something about telling Luke he embarrassed him after losing a Senate race.
Shame.
It's the most deep-seated human emotion.
If there's any human part of him you can still reach,
- it's through shame.
- I don't think he was ashamed.
I...
Come on, politicians can't feel ashamed.
They're just like us.
Try it, shame.
It's the thing buried deepest in the mind than anything else.
Here...
He won't go into his jacket again until tonight, so I need that back by 8:00 p.m.
This is great.
Thanks.
Yes, thank you.
No problem.
Laurel, could I talk to you for a second?
Sure.
Look, this "I love you" thing is really just
- something I said automatically.
- I know.
- I just...
- ‭Anyway, I'm the commitment-phobe, so you don't need to say anything.
What do you mean?
What don't I have to say?
Just that we shouldn't get too serious...
Do you think we're getting too serious?
No, I just...
Wait, what were you gonna say?
What?
Just-just give me a minute, okay?
I'm...
I think I love you, too.
- What?
- Forget it.
No, no.
No, seriously,
I didn't hear what you said.
Maybe I love you, too.
That's all.
If the world's gonna end, I thought I should say it.
Wait.
Just wait.
You can't just say that and... walk away.
I think I love you, too.

Blueprints?
Fine.
Just look straight, act like them,
- don't react.
- ‭Yeah.
Let's do this.
Okay.
We just have to salt the beds.
Just a few boxes in each.
- Oh, no.
Oh, no, oh, no.
‭
- Just relax.
- Just act normal.
- What are you doing?
Working.
Like you.
Just working.
See?
How unchivalrous.
Making the woman do the hard work.
Well, you know, I tried to push it, but... you know women.
I insisted.

It's nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you as well.
Figured I'd take a break from Capitol Hill, come on down, and see how y'all are doing.
We're doing just fine.
Almost done.
Just getting the beds in.
- It'll be a week.
I'm Brian.
- Ah.
Good, good, good.
And, um, this is my... assistant,
Roch... sheen.
Rasheen Moleen.
- Nice to meet you.

- And you.
We were just...
You're just...?
Just... just... helping out.
You know, it takes a village, right?
Where are we piping the water next?
- The back nine.
- Good.
Where's that?
Come with us.
We're heading there now.
This is more disorganized than I thought it would be.
Well, we're still working out the kinks.
You might be interested in telling the senator
- your concerns.
- The senator?
Do I know you?
Hello?
Senator, we have that conference call that we need
- to get onto.
Very important.
- Ah, yes.
The call.
The call, yes.
Uh, hello.
Oh.
Oh, right.
Yes...
Yes, yes, yes!
Okay, quick thing.
Uh, yeah.
Keep it up, guys.
After you lost the first Senate race, do you remember what Dad told you?
- Sis, I'm a little busy here.
- There's a chance shame might have an impact on Dad's infection.
Is this what your friends say?
No, this is what I saw.
Well, here's the thing, Dad doesn't shame easily.
- I know.
- ‭Keep it up.
But I reminded him of the night you lost the Senate race, and... he cried.
He cried about me losing?
No, he cried about what he said to you.
- Then he had something in his eye.
‭
- No.
- No, he's still in there.
- Laurel, he was never in there to begin with.
He never was our father.
He was our... manager.
Okay, well, what else will shame him?
What else about him pisses you off?
What else did he say?
It's not about me.
It was never about me.
He always loved you.
- More than me.
- What are you talking about?
You really want to make him ashamed?
Remember that camera you got for your ninth birthday?
If anything makes him ashamed, that would.
Today is my ninth birthday, and it's the best one ever because I finally got what I wanted, a camera.
Zoom in.
Zoom out.
- Zoom in.
Zoom out.
- What's this?
- This is the movie of my life...
- I just found it, Dad.
Remember, you bought me my first camera?
That's my mom.
- She got me these shoes.
- I missed this birthday?
You did.
Don't remember that.
I heard my dad's car.
Wait, here he comes.
Oh, brother.
Where were you?
I-I couldn't get away.
You weren't at the office.
So don't even try.
- Oh, please.
- That's enough.
How do you turn this thing off?
I'll turn it off when it's over.
- Your daughter was crying.
- Well, she'll get over it.
Will she?
You missed your daughter's birthday to be with your girlfriend.
Oh, please.
Just don't start.
- Turn it off.
- It's one thing to do it to me.
- But to her?
- She doesn't even know where I was.
She knows you weren't here!
- Please?
- Please keep your voice down?
Don't tell me what to do.
You should have been here!
You really want me to move out?
I didn't know you were there.
- I know you're lying.
It's time.
- Oh, for God's sake!
I'm done.
I love my dad.
And I did.
Dad?
Dad.
Dad, are you okay?
You've got five minutes, Red, then I'm back to our sit-in.
Whoa, whoa.
Calm down, Senator, just have a seat.
I've have been sitting for way too many hours, thanks to you.
So... what's the deal?
All right, well, if you refuse to sit, fine, but, uh, I'm a bit queasy, so... could you just s-stand still, right-right there, for a minute?
Talk.
Thank you.
Well...
Here's my offer.
Oh, come on.
Hello?
Uh, Laurel, what is it?
W-What?
No, y... yes.
Wait, when?
But how did...
Yes, I'm-I'm on my way.
Uh, we're gonna need to delay this.
Why?
W-W-What's wrong?
Uh, my dad is sick.
Damn Healys.
Do you need anything, Senator?
No.
Has anyone been in here, buddy?
In your office?
- No.
- The intern.
- What's his name?
- ‭Gary.
He hasn't been in here.
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.
Why don't you bring him in here?
No.
I'll go talk to him.
You're a good person, aren't you?
No, just a person.
No, it's not a bad thing, to be good.
You know, sometimes I...
I think you're like the son I never had.
- That's nice, Senator.
- Then sometimes I think you're not.
- Did it work?
- Yes, but no.
We have to find another way.
Okay, where's the badge?
Any day now.
Oh, oh.
Ooh, in his sock?
Yeah, it's in your sock.
Here you go.
Do you need help with that?
No.
No.
I think I can do this.
Where the hell...?
Is-is this what you're looking for...
Senator?
Yes.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well, see you tomorrow.
Just...
It's not easy... seeing him like that.
You all right?
My whole childhood, I wanted to see Dad show some kind of shame for what he did to Mom.
Now I have.
How does it feel?
Awful.
Are you serious?
It's...
Oh, it's 9:00 a.m.
I have a solution.
- Another way into the hothouse?
‭
- No.
We don't have to get into the hothouse.
They're still a week away.
Okay.
Then... what?
We need to sabotage the trees.
They're in the trees now.
We need to make them absciss.
- Absciss means...
- I know what it means.
Make them shed, make their blossoms drop before the bugs can get to the hothouses.
- And how do we do that?
‭
- Mm.
Ammonium nitrate fertilizer.
Shame?
Yes.
It worked on my dad.
The person is still in there.
He can be reached.
Yeah, Red really doesn't do shame.
It's not his brand.
Well, he was crying last week.
So you want to figure out what'll shame him?
Yes.
God, you're sexy.
Lana.
He keeps calling you Lana.
Yes.
I need your laptop.
Do you need a moment, Senator?
I just miss her, and I'm...
I'm so ashamed.
Okay, why don't we take a break, and, uh, we'll be back to discuss
- more on the congressional dysfunction.
- ‭
- Oh.
Lana.
Where are you, Lana?
I think I saw her photo in Red's drawer.
Whose?
Lana's.
So we just sprinkle some ammonium nitrate on the roots?
That's what it says.
How long does it take?
Depends on how much we use.
Hey, let's not draw a lot of attention to ourselves.
We wouldn't want...
Yup.
This is not gonna look good.
No.
Is there a problem, officer?
License and registration.
- A flickering tail light perchance?
- ‭Gustav!
Excuse my friend, officer.
Actually, you were speeding, sir.
What?
I was most definitely not speeding.
- Rochelle, you...
- You know what?
I think we should probably record this.
- Ma'am, please put the phone away.
- ‭Why would I do that?
Because you're not allowed to record an officer in D.C.
Actually, in D.C., all you need is one party's consent, so, smile.
Not when you're obstructing police business.
Ah, here we go.
- This is bad.
‭
- Don't talk.
Shh.
It makes them angry.
You've been through this before?
It's why I don't have a car.
Oh, great.
Now what?
Well, well, well.
What are the odds?
Senator Healy, may we have a word?
So, you're a united front now?
You've been getting people to steal my security badge?
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Call my office, make an appointment.
Right now, I have a floor to sit on.
We think you should stop this.
Check on your witness.
I think you'll find he's not available anymore.
It's not about your father.
"I love you, Lukey Pookie."
This is about something more serious.
There's a sex tape.
Not a good one.
Thank you.
This has been an amazing achievement.
Now I think it's time to bring this sit-in to a close.
- What?
No!
- Yes!
Yes.
We have made our point.
Now I think we should let the majority vote.
It's time.
Don't make any furtive movements.
- Excuse me, I know how to be black.
- Turn around.
What's the fertilizer for?
My friend bought a tree.
Must be a big tree.
- If you would just check my ID...
- I have it.
No, you have my driver's license.
I mean my work ID.
It's in my back pocket.
If you would just...
- Do not reach in your pocket!
‭
- Please.
Just check my back... pocket.
You work for the NSA?
Yes, sir.
I'm a senior intelligence officer.
Damn it.
Sorry to bother you, Agent Triplett.
You folks are free to leave.
Sorry about the misunderstanding.
Thank you.
You're NSA?
!
Of course.
What'd you think?
That's insane.
(classical music playing
All those in favor of allowing the budget to pass as is.
The motion is passed.
The budget will go in front of the full Senate without bifurcation.
There, you see that?
We can get things done after all.
We shall not be moved, my ass.
- Huh?
- Damn it.
Look, the sentence needs to be precise and direct.
Well, your precision won't matter
- unless we get there in time.
- Where are we?
- Almost done.
- So you didn't even bother voting?
You just let it go through?
It wouldn't have mattered.
They had the numbers.
That's why you were doing the sit-in.
- I don't understand.
- Laurel, will you please stop
- telling me how to do my job?
- Wasn't that the point?
- Can you trust me?
‭
- Sorry, I need to focus.
All motorcycle helmets are required to pass
- federal motor vehicle...
- Are you serious?
You had a motorcycle helmet bill?
Yes.
Very important.
We have the votes for it.
- Yes, Republicans, too.
- Good.
Let's go.
Wait... wait.
What are you going to do?
The trick was to make the motorcycle helmet law public health policy,
- and give it a robust advertis...
- Okay, I don't understand.
Once it's about the public health, the asterisk includes language that affects paragraph 1403,
- sub-paragraph six, footnotes 11...
- ‭Meaning?
The motorcycle helmet law overrides the farm bill on issues that cross state lines.
He lost.
He just doesn't know it yet.
What the hell?
!
"Funding for the federal motorcycle helmet law supersedes all funding for paragraph 1403..."
Gareth!
Gareth?
Ah.
Here she is.
Yes.
Here I am.
Looks like it's come down to the two of us.
Sure does.
Come on in.
Sit.
All the children have gone to bed.
It's just the adults now.
Shall we talk?
Sure.
You go first.
What I don't understand is why you didn't say anything.
You didn't say anything about your car, either.
Yes, but there is a big difference between owning a BMW, and being a senior intelligence officer with the NSA.
- Yes.
- ‭Hey, guys.
Sorry to interrupt.
Where's Laurel?
She went upstairs to find you.
To...
Your brother kind of tricked me with this helmet law.
Yes, he can be sneaky that way.
Seems to run in the family...
Lana?
What?
You were about to call me Lana, weren't you?
It doesn't matter.
We have the grassroots.
- We have the gerrymandered districts.
- You mean the crop circles.
We have everything for a permanent majority.
I look like her, don't I?
I looked online.
Except for the hair.
Maybe if I put it back?
How's that?
What are we talking about here?
Your first love.
My first love... was and is our great country.
You turned Lana in.
She was an illegal immigrant working in your dorm.
You were in love with her, but you hated the fact that you were in love with her.
This is disgusting.
You want to make everything about sex.
I didn't say anything about sex.
I said "love."
I couldn't have been in love with her.
She wasn't my type.
Then why do you keep calling me Lana?
Here's the truth.
- You're ashamed of what you did.
- I'm proud of what I did.
Then what did you do?
I turned in a woman who was in this country illegally.
She's dead now.
Did you know that?
You sent her to Guatemala.
She was born here, but her parents weren't.
- You're making this up.
- ‭No.
And you know I'm not.
Go on.
Let it out.
You know you want to.
Get it out.
You need to be...
What?
What?
Come on.
What do I need to be?
I'm Lana.
What do I need to be?
Stop.
No.
Why?
Why are you doing this?
‭I love you, Gareth.
Why are you...?
Why are you...?
My butt.
You shot me in the butt.
There it goes.
‭Hey, it's going under the door.
Get it!
Oops.
Sorry, Senator.
I'll...
I'll get some paper towels, and... clean this up.
Oh, and I got your smoothie.
For years now, we've let Republicans rule this chamber.
Well, I am sick and tired of playing second fiddle to some of these...
Senator.
Do you want to relinquish your time, Senator?
Whoa, whoa.
How long is this supposed to take?
I don't know.
Could be a day, could be a week.
Why don't you ask your NSA friends?
This is really bothering you, isn't it?
I just...
I don't understand why we've been running around with salt and fertilizer, when you could have just waved your NSA magic wand.
My NSA magic wand?
Your government connections.
Your ability to wiretap.
First of all, I do not wiretap.
Okay?
Second of all, I was on leave.
Third of all, this is only bothering you because you have a massive crush on me.
Okay.
I'm going now.
See?
You can't get enough of me.
My... magnetism.
I said, you can't get enough...
Five cherry blossoms?
That's not enough.
There needs to be more than that.
Ah, we did it!
That's kind of gross.
Hey, hey.
What's going on?

Ricky, why would you let the fucking door close behind us?
Now we can't get to the tour bus and it's fucking chilly here, if you didn't notice!
I'm fucking stressed out, okay?
I talked to Lucy on the phone this morning.
She got me all worked up, hot and bothered.
She talked about her warm mouth drinking coffee...
I'm fucking horny!
Rick, you've got to stay focused, man.
We've got to make some money.
This is getting fucking ridiculous, boys!
Welcome to Helsinki, dick-lickers.
Ricky:
Suck me off!
Give me the fucking sheet!
What the fuck bullshit do we have on the go today?
"Taxi ride, sing a song, 25 bucks.
"Do an ice sculpture, 25.
"Do the news, $25.
"Okay, here we go:
meet the real Santa
"and share a glass of traditional 'poronkuse' together.
"Note: all three of you need to drink it in order to get paid.
$1,000."
This is what we're doing.
Hold the fuck on!
Did you say the real Santa?
Are you fucking shitting me?
That's what it says on the sheet.
Ricky:
Boys, having Christmas drinks with the big guy?
That's fucking amazing!
Ricky, just wait now.
Who are you talking about when you say "the big guy"?
Look, what's the fucking catch to that?
That sounds way too easy.
Let's just do the easy ones, the cheap ones, Julian.
Fuck the cheap ones!
We're going for the big one, man!
We're meeting Santa, we're getting paid 1,000 bucks.
Creeps, do whatever you want.
I'm going to go out and get my candy cane licked.
Fuck off!
Let's go meet Santa.
God, he does a lot of sex stuff.
Ricky:
How fucking cool is this?
We get to have drinks with the real Santa!
Yeah, the real one.
So this is the North Pole?
Well, we're pretty far north, Ricky, and there's poles everywhere.
Julian:
Well at least it's not as cold here.
This is so fucking cool.
So like, he is just Santa?
He's not Jesus or God...?
No.
Just Santa.
Just Santa.
Fuck, this is cool.
Just Santa.
(Birds chirping)
My fuck, boys, there he is!
This is so fucking cool!
Santa!
Hey!
Oh, hello, boys!
This is cool.
How are you?
Yes.
These are my reindeer.
(Mixed greetings)
Well, some of them.
I've a really, really big herd.
This is cool.
But now I have...
(indistinct)
Please come in.
Sure.
Open the gate and... and I can... soon I can serve you a really, really special drink.
His name is Niila.
Niila?
Niila?
Niila.
N-I-I-L-A.
Don't remember him from the song.
I've met lots of mall Santas over the years, but I never thought I'd actually meet the real fucking Santa and get to feed his reindeer.
I can't wait to party and get drunk as fuck with that cocksucker.
This is awesome!
Bubbles:
Now, we're supposed to have a drink of... poron...
poronkuse?
Poronkuse.
Poronkuse.
Poronkuse.
That makes you very strong boy.
Here, feed him, Rick.
Here, do you want some?
Feed him some...
Look at that.
This is so fucking cool.
You're feeding one of Santa's reindeers, Ricky.
(Chuckling) Santa:
Okay...
Ricky:
This is awesome.
Here we are.
(Grunting)
Julian:
What's he doing, trying to milk him?
Maybe it's, uh...
(Urinating)
Maybe it's like a reindeer White Russian.
No, no, this is much, much better than milk.
This is poronkuse.
You drink that every day?
Every morning.
When I wake up, then I drink this a little bit.
Just a small cup.
It's very refreshing also.
It's kind of neat to be here at the "real" Santa's village in Finland, but when you... when you break it down, all it really is
(Whispering) is just some crazy bastard in a suit out in the woods drinking piss.
Okay, my boys, here we go.
Now you'll get it.
Ugh...
I promised you to have reindeer piss and, as we say in Finland, poronkuse.
It makes you very strong... and will send you to another new planet!
Oh, it fucks you up?
Okay, I know...
I think you are Ricky.
Yes.
Yeah, I know that you'll love this stuff.
It's very good for you.
Okay.
I didn't give a fuck what kind of piss I was drinking.
If it was going to get me high,
I'll drink fucking "allimigator" piss, fucking zebra piss, moose piss, fucking squirrel piss.
I'd even a fucking honey badger's piss.
Now, okay.
Let's get fucked up.
Bottoms up.
I'm not drinking piss, Ricky.
Are you kidding me?
Yeah, it's not piss...
I don't...
I don't care if it's reindeer piss or fucking any other kind of piss.
Santa:
Okay, that's your choice.
It's piss!
Piss is piss, Santa.
Okay.
I'm close to starving to death right now and I haven't had much booze in me since I got here, but there's no fucking way
I'm drinking reindeer piss to make money.
You're gonna make me fucking puke, Ricky.
Well, you guys should be doing it too.
It's 1,000 fucking dollars!
Ricky...
I'm not wasting a buzz-on, though, boys.
Fuck it.
It can't been worse than the time Willy Goat pissed in my mouth.
(Heavy sigh)
Ricky, this is a bad idea.
Piss buzz-on, here I fucking come!
(Panting)
(Christmas music playing in background)
Okay, Ricky!
You are my man!
You did it!
How do you taste?
The taste, it was very good, yes?
Oh...
A little bit strong, but makes very, very good.
It kind of tastes like gasoline and ocean.
You sure you don't want this, boys?
No.
Because I need to get fucked up!
I'm drinking all of it.
Fuck it!
(Hard exhalation) Bubbles:
Ricky... (Whispering) You're spilling...
Okay!
Well done!
Yeah, fantastic!
And now I also want to have it a little bit.
(Groaning, panting)
(Mouthing silently) He's out of his fucking mind.
Nice.
Cheers, Santa.
I can't fucking believe what's happening right now.
I've seen Ricky do some pretty fucked up things in my life, but to drink three cups of reindeer piss just 'cause some nutcase in a suit says,
"Oh, yeah, it sends you to another planet."
Ricky is fucked.
Ahh!
You did it.
Now you are strong.
You will get very much strength.
Yes.
Or die.
Either or.
How long does it take to kick in?
(Hard exhalation)
The boys think I'm fucked for drinking it... (Stomach gurgling) ...but once this shit kicks in, we'll see with who's happy with drinking piss and who's not happy about fucking drinking piss, won't we?
(Stomach growling)
Ohh, fuck, boys, I feel like I'm going to puke, but I...
I can't puke 'cause it hasn't kicked in yet, even though it's been over an hour, for fuck's sakes!
Ricky, just...
Why don't you just puke?
I mean, you've got to get all of that piss out of you.
Piss is poisonous.
Julian, give me a drink.
Ricky, you're not putting your pissy lips on my glass, I said.
I've got to get this taste out of my mouth.
We've got to do something simple now so I can go fucking eat or something.
Just got to stop thinking about fucking piss.
(Liquid trickling) Ricky.
What?
Have a look here.
Look up, bud.
(Heaving) There you go.
There you go.
All that piss pouring out of there, buddy.
(Retching)
Just think of the gallons of piss coming out of that thing.
(Retching)
Julian:
Let 'er all out, man.
(Groaning)
(Sighing) Okay, let's go do something fucking easy.
I need to eat.
What should we do?
The cab or the ice sculpting?
Bubbles:
I don't know.
Do you want to just... do the cab, maybe?
It should be right up here.
Singstar Taxis.
Look at that wiener dog.
I'm so hungry I could eat the little cocksucker.
What the fuck do we got to do here?
It just says, "Take ride in Singstar Taxi, sing a song, and don't talk about hockey."
Like, that doesn't sound that hard.
Sounds very fucking weird.
Sounds easy.
Too easy to be true.
That sounds weird.
Bubs, I can't even fucking sing, though, man.
Hello.
Ooh, look at this thing.
Oh, right on.
What do you guys want to sing?
This is decent.
I wonder if they've got any Helix.
Yeah, Helix.
I don't want to sing that.
I'll sing Rush or Guns N' Roses.
Julian:
Iron Maiden, maybe.
That'd be fucking cool.
First you say you can't sing and then you pick Iron Maiden?
Bubbles:
Okay, boys, what are we going to do here?
Julian:
Something easy like "Gimme an R"
or fucking Tragically Hip.
Rush, maybe.
"Number of the Beast".
I don't see any Rush.
There's no Tragically Hip.
Why don't we do Guns N' Roses?

Ricky:
We can do the whistling song.
The whistling song?
(Whistling "Patience" by Guns N' Roses)
"Patience", Ricky.
Yeah, yeah, "Patience".
I want to do that one.
You want to do "Patience"?
Okay.
Here...
Can you sit here?
I can't sit backwards.
I get sick.
Let's switch.
Julian:
Switch?
Yeah.
Bubbles:
So is it "Patience"?
You want to that, Bubs, go for it.
You're the fucking big singer here.
All right.
Can we have, uh, "Patience"
by Guns N' Roses, please?
Driver:
No.
You have to sing this one.

We should just go to, like, a supermarket and buy a shit-ton of food and fucking just eat and eat.
Well, we should if we were smart.
We should save a little bit just in case we can find, like, a piece of weed or a piece of hash.
I fucking need to smoke something, boys!

Bubbles:
Somebody's getting on.
Hi, guys.
Esa Tikkanen.
How are you?
Esa Tikkanen!
Oh, those motherfuckers!
I'm Ricky.
How are you?
Hi, Ricky.
Julian.
Hey.
Should I know him?
Uh, yeah, Julian.
That's...
that's Tikkanen.
He played on...
well, I can't tell you what he payed on, but he played on a...
(Frustrated growl) a pretty famous sports team.
Are you kidding me?
Yeah, I'm freaking out right now.
Just keep it together.
I'm freaking out.
This is hard.
This is a tough one.
Hey, are you guys from, Canada?
Yeah.
Yeah, we're from Canada.

I'm sorry, Julian, but he's fucking sitting right here!

How hard is it to sit next to a guy and not talk about hockey?
Come on!
Now none of us get to eat.
He won fucking five Stanley Cups!
Four with the Oilers!
Julian:
I know...
This is pretty awesome.
We actually do love hockey.
We were supposed to not talk about hockey to make $25, but that's out the window.
It's worth more than $25 to me.
Well, we may as well talk about it then.
Who's the best player you ever played with?
Can say only one guy:
Wayne Gretzky.
Ricky, what kind of a question's that?
He played with fucking Wayne.
Well, he's played with a lot of good people.
I know, but he played with Wayne.
There's nobody better than Wayne.
Who's the craziest person?
Ah, greatest, Dave Semenko.
Oh, yeah?
Semenko.
Yeah.
He was top pick.
He's a tough... (Mixed comments) ...tough bastard.
Everybody was scared of him...
Glory time.
I would not want to fight that guy.
No, no.
You don't want to go even close to him.
No.
But that was hockey, old... good, old time hockey.
Oh, yeah.
Well, I'm sorry,
I blew the fucking 25 dollar task, but it was worth it for me just to hear stories about the Oilers.
It was pretty awesome, but we've got to find a way to make some fucking money here, boys.
Oh, here, I've got the fucking list.
We can go do the...
The ice sculpting?
...go do the ice sculpting.
"Go to ArtMarika
"and make an ice sculpture.
Best one wins." So we'll do that.
"Best one wins"?
You better not fuck it up.
So one of us has to win, then?
Yeah.
Well, that's perfect.
Should have did that first.
Ricky:
Well, it's been nice to meet you.
Well, it's nice to meet you guys.
You wouldn't happen to have any weed or hash or anything on you or anything?
Ricky!
Ricky...
Do not ask Esa Tikkanen if he's got weed or hash!
Well, maybe he knows where I can get some or borrow some.
Well, in Finland we don't have that one.
Sorry.
Great.
Sorry about that.
He's just... he smokes a lot and he's not that bright.
You shouldn't be asking people that.
Don't worry about it.
All right, let's go do some fucking ice sculptures, I guess.

Good to meet you.
Hey!
Nice to meet you guys.
Awesome to meet you.
Nice to meet you.

It was great.
Say hi to Gretzky for me when you talk to him next.
Yes, I will.
(Awkward chuckle) Have a good one, guys.
All right, cheers.
(Mixed farewells)
That was pretty fucking cool.
Get the fuck out of my way!
Bubbles:
We should've did this one first 'cause we can't lose.
It's, "go meet ArtMarika, make an ice sculpture".
Whoever's got the best one gets the money.
Are we going to split the money?
Well, I don't know that we should.
I'm a pretty sculptor.
Maybe I'll keep the money part if I win.
Let's get this over with.
Julian:
I can't do this shit.
Hi.
How are you doing?
I guess we're supposed to be doing some ice sculpting or something.
Yes.
There is your tools and here is the ice box.
So make your sculpture.
Go, go, go, go!
Decent.
Did you make that kitty?
That's a kitty?
Yes.
Kitty ice.
Woman:
You can make your own.
Could I make a kitty like that?
I'll just copy off of you.
Yeah.
How do you turn this baby on?
(Chainsaw revving) Oh, Ricky...
I wanted the chainsaw.
There's another one over there, Bubs.
Where?
(Saws buzzing)
( ♪♪ )
Jesus Murphy!
Holy fuck, this is cold!
Bubs, I told you we should have brought fucking jackets!
( ♪♪ )
It's a fuck of a lot harder than it looks.
What do you think, Bubs?
What is it?
Julian:
A naked chick.
Bubbles:
Are those her ice boobs?
How's it going, Bubs?
Oh, I'm fucking soaked, Ricky.
Yeah, it's not fun, is it?
No, this is a bullshit task.
Blew the chainsaw right apart, blew the motor right out of her.
'Cause, uh, you know, I don't fuck around.
When it comes to ice sculpting, I take it quite seriously.
Would you smoke this, Bubs?
What?
Would you smoke this?
Ricky, it looks like a big ice cock.
Ah, fuck, does it?
Well, look, it looks like the shaft and the two balls, right?
Ricky...
Ricky, can you press the fucking button on the back of this fucking piece of shit?
What are you sculpting, a cock?
It's not a cock!
It's supposed to be a joint.
Looks like a cock.
(Sigh) Fuck.
Does it really look like a cock?
Big time.
Bubbles:
It looks more like a cock now, Ricky.
Well, maybe that's what I'm making, I guess.
I am making a cock now.
Fuck it.
That's what I was always making.
Bubbles:
Well, it's working.
Okay.
Perfect.
It's definitely starting to look like a kitty.
I've got to get his...
That's an awful big piss hole.
Fuck.
Boys, I think it's pretty clear who's going to be winning the money here.
Who?
Cat Stevens is starting to take shape.
You think that's going to win?
Did you see this?
All right, I changed it.
This is now Arnold Schwarzenegger.
"Terminator".
I...
Don't you find it odd that you started out making a woman and then it turned into Arnold Schwarzenegger?
That might say...
Why don't you shut the fuck up?
maybe you're attracted to Arnold Schwarzenegger.
I'm not...
Bubs!
Is Arnold Schwarzenegger I fucked up the face.
your perfect idea of a woman?
Yeah?
Hey!
You get...!
Oh, you want to fuck around?
I was just fucking playing around with Julian, you know, giving him a little teasy-weasy about his statue.
He starts getting all fucking serious, taking swipes at Cat Stevens.
Julian!
Fuck off!
Stop acting like a dick.
I'm freezing my ass off trying to make us all some money here, like, trying to do a good fucking job.
Don't understand why Bubbles had to be such a fucking dick to me.
You put a big scratch on Cat Stevens' face!
Thank you, you just helped it out.
Oh, yeah?
Don't, man...
Bubs!
Well...
Don't fuck with his pecs!
Well, you put a big...
Now what am I supposed to do with that now?
Cat Stevens has a big dent in his face.
I've got to work around that now.
Julian:
Bubs, you totally fucked up his left pec, man!
It's fucked now.
Well, you shouldn't have been fucking around with...
Don't...
Julian!
How does that feel, huh?
Oh, that's how you want to fucking play it, is it?
You want to play it like that?
(Saw buzzing) Aww, Bubs...!
Boys!
Julian:
Are you fucking kidding me?
Are you kidding me?
Julian wanted to take it up a notch, acting like a fucking bully.
I showed him how to take it up a notch!
What do you think of that?
Huh?
Oh, that's just..
(Tearfully) fucking just great, Julian!
(Sniffling) Julian:
That's what you get.
(Mixed shouting) What are you guys doing?
Well, he just cut Arnold's fucking head off.
He knocked Cat Stevens right on the ground.
Mine was the best, that's why.
He can't let me win.
Mine was the best!
Mine's the best!
So now what?
You're going to judge them, I suppose, are you?
He sculpted a cock.
It was supposed to be a joint, it turned into a cock, and I think it looks pretty fucking good.
Fucking worthless and weak.
Ricky:
Well, it's better than these ones.
Julian:
This still looks pretty good if...
You know, it's headless, but it looks pretty good.
It looks like a Greek statue or something.
It looks like a torso that's been ripped in half.
Oh... are you fucking kidding me?
Oh, fuck, did that fall over?
Aww, what a shame.
What was this?
That was a cat, a kitty cat, Cat Stevens.
It was the shittiest- looking ice cat
I've ever seen in my life.
It was fucking awesome!
Look at that cat and then now...
That was nothing!
This was pretty much an exact replica of that one.
Julian:
It was shit, Bubs.
Who's the winner?
I guess Ricky.
Who wins then?
Well, this wins.
Look at it, it's a beautiful cat.
What?
Ricky:
What do you mean, this wins?
Julian:
She's not in the contest!
It says the best of the ice sculptures.
This wins.
You're out.
For fuck's sakes!
Julian:
So we froze our asses off for nothing?
That's not fair.
Are you kidding me?
That is not fair.
That's fucking bullshit.
Ricky:
Oh, that's nice.
Well, fuck it.
Way to wreck my cock.
We're fucked!
Again!
This whole trip has been fucked.
I mean, obviously we're not going to beat a professional at fucking ice sculpting, for fuck's sakes.
And this whole reading the weather bullshit?
Pfft!
I guarantee you this is going to be fucked.
Bubbles:
It said read the weather without getting a hard-on.
Why the fuck would we get a hard-on reading the weather?
This is going to be easy.
I don't know.
Just don't.
It's some kind of a fucking trick,
I guarantee you.
Won't be me that fucks up.
Hey, how you doing?
Oh, hey, guys.
Holy fuck!
We're supposed to do the weather or something?
Co-host it?
Yeah, yeah, you can just line up here on the black line.
Okay.
Thank you.
Yeah.
Good.
Bubbles:
I see what they're up to.
(Grunting) Fuck.
Keep it together, keep it together!
I'm okay!
I'll just think about something else.
Just think about "The Flintstones".
Both of yous.
Yes, I do.
Check out this shit, boys.
Like, it's blue back here, but here, when you look at it, it's got, like, all the clouds...
Weather script, man.
Blue screen, green screen, they call it.
Okay, we've got a lot of fucking clouds and fucking bullshit here.
It's going to fuck with some people.
We've got some rain moving in and you're going to fucking piss a lot of people off with that, but it is pretty sunny down here and...
Just move your cock for a sec, Bubs... and the sun here and the sun over in...
Oh, your tits are in the way.
With the sun over in this direction, you guys will be happy.
Sun up here.
Oh, fuck, boys.
fucked 'er.
Look.
Got a hard on.
(Awkward chuckle) Look,
Ricky's got a...
Don't even joke about it.
weather arrow cock!
Don't even be joking...
Weather arrow cock.
Ricky Bubbles:
(Imitating horns honking)
How the fuck did they do that?
They put, like, a naked girl on the screen.
Holy fuck, Ricky, turn around.
(Speaking in Finnish)
Ah...
Ricky.
Hi.
Hi, I'm shaved...
I'm Bubbles.
(Giggling) You're... shaved.
You're not shaved, but you're shave...
I don't know...
Julian:
Keep it together...
I'm trying to.
(Speaking Finnish)
Think of "The Flintstones".
I am thinking of "The Flintstones", but now I'm thinking about Wilma.
(Groaning) Oh, fuck, boys...
Ricky, what are you doing?
Ricky:
Fucking...
I'm trying.
I'm fighting this fucking thing.
Well, fight it!
(Sigh) Julian, uh-oh.
Don't, Bubs...
(Speaking Finnish)
(Whispering) She pointed at my bird.
She pointed right at my bird.
No, she's not.
She's pointing at the fucking weather screen.
Well...
Ricky:
For fuck's sakes!
Bubs, just...
We're done.
Julian:
Are you kidding me?
Boys, I've been away from Lucy too long.
I can't fucking deal with it.
Fucked 'er.
Nice fucking going, bud.
Nice going.
Ricky:
Well, he fucked up and you fucked up, and everyone fucks up once in a while.
When did I fuck up?
Look at this!
Like, what the fuck do you expect?
I find it weird that you didn't get one.
Because I'm...
Maybe I'm the one who gets it more than you.
Ricky:
Maybe you don't like women.
Fuck you.
(Speaking in Finnish)
Nice to meet ya.
(Speaking in Finnish)
Nice to meet you.
(Chuckling) Fuck.
(Speaking Finnish)
Julian:
We've just lost the easiest $100 ever, boys.
What the fuck is wrong with you guys?
Why'd you have to stare at her the whole time?
Bubbles:
Well, Julian, I'm not around fucking bare naked ladies that often, and when I am, things happen.
I'm sorry.
Bubs, peek, okay?
Just have a little peek.
You don't got to fucking stare!
I wasn't fucking staring, was I?
Course you were staring!
No, the one-eyed mountain man was fucking staring!
He's got a mind of his own.
I can't control what he does.
You're fucked.
Tom:
Ricky...
You're fucked!
A question for you boys.
Julian:
What's that?
How does it feel to be complete fucking losers?
What?
You didn't make a goddamn penny for yourselves again today, and we're heading to Amsterdam.
Julian:
What?
Which is really unfortunate for you guys.
You better be fucking joking right now.
Amsterdam?
Yup.
Oh, Jesus fucking Christ, boys.
We can't go to fucking Amsterdam with no money!
The best goddamn weed in the world too, Ricky.
Too bad you're not going to be able to buy any of it.
See you hole tonguers back at the bus.
Wheels up in an hour.
Hole tonguers?
I hope this was worth it, boys.
I hope it was fucking worth it.
Ricky:
Way to go.
Way to go, you fucking asshole.
Fucking Amsterdam with no money!
You fucking idiot!
Fuck, Ricky!
You're punching yourself in the bird!
( ♪♪ )
(Seabirds squawking)
Fish:
Fuck!
Fuck!
Fuck off!
Fuck!
...
Fuck off!
Jesus Christ!
(Whisper) Fuck.
(Light clicks off) Fuck off.
Mmm.
It's delicious.
Olivia, I love it.
I'm so glad.
It's their signature cake... 20 layers of crepes, each one lined with just the perfect amount of pastry cream.
Dad, what do you think?
I think I've never heard you describe a dessert before.
Have you chosen a venue yet?
Jake wants to get married at my parents' place on the Vineyard, even though it is the site of a famous shipwreck.
Ah, she's insanely superstitious.
- Do you see this crack on my screen?
- Yes.
That is there because this klutz crashed into me when I was standing in line at the Shake Shack.
Jake wants me to toss it, but because it's how we met,
I insist on keeping it.
Ah, superstitious and sentimental.
I could not believe it when I saw him a few days later at that café in Georgetown.
I didn't let him get away that time.
I'm sure that you already know this, but Jake, he just thinks the world of you.
How did you describe her again?
Uh, the sister I never had.
_
Everything okay?
Uh, work emergency.
I have to go.
You have it?
Is the feed up?
Yeah.
They've just entered the building.
I see you, Vanessa Moss.
Hide your wallet, update your spam filter, and unplug your phone, for that stampede you hear thundering over the hill is the voracious and unyielding herd of candidates and their fundraisers, all just looking to pick your pockets clean
of every hard-earned dollar you got.
The most offensive of this year's crop of snake-oil salesman...
Governor Francisco Vargas, the two-faced democrat who had the nerve to come before you, lovers of "Liberty", on this very stage and swear to yours truly not to enter the presidential race.
Governor Vargas?
No chance in hell.
I don't know.
It's not impossible.
Damn near.
They said the same thing about Grant when he first ran, and Vargas is polling better with women than Grant was at this stage.
You're thinking about working for Vargas.
You're jumping ship.
No.
I could never leave Cyrus.
It's okay to be looking out for yourself.
You're gonna be out of a job in a year.
I mean, if Cyrus were to run Vargas' campaign, then I'd jump ship.
Cyrus running Vargas?
Who put that idea in your head?
I'm leaving now.
Okay.
I have five minutes.
- I've got four.
- Where's the coffee?
- You were supposed to bring the coffee.
- I don't do that anymore.
- What do you mean, "anymore"?
- I'm running OPA.
I don't have time to bring the coffee anymore.
You think the press secretary has time to bring the coffee?
- What do you need?
- A favor.
I need you to look into Cyrus for me.
I need to know what he's been up to, where he's been going, who's he's been calling.
- I can't.
- Why not?
Because, as I said, I'm running OPA.
Yeah.
Does Olivia know you're saying that?
Of course not.
Olivia's been holed up in her apartment watching a video feed of Jake and his new girlfriend.
She has no idea what anyone's been saying or doing.
She's not stalking.
She's focusing on something she thinks is important.
On something that's not her real, actual job.
Keep pretend-running OPA, Quinn.
I'll find someone else to help me.
Next time don't forget the coffee.
Yeppers.
Yes!
If Javi makes this...
I know.
They go to finals.
Stop putting added pressure on him.
Yes!
Yes!
Who's that?
That your ex?
Yeah.
That's Kim.
Is that Kim's boyfriend?
Maybe.
Maybe?
Did you know about him?
Yeah, of course.
It's just the first time I've seen the guy.
Mellie.
What would you think about changing our environmental platform?
Please tell me you're not taking that meeting.
I'm not.
Mellie, I told you not to meet with him.
I know you think he's the devil and all, but...
I don't think he's the devil.
I know he's the devil, as do you.
Maybe, he's changed.
Well, screw me sideways.
Hollis.
Don't promise him anything.
I have to go.
It is so good to see you again.
Likewise!
Remember this guy we tried to kill?
I think he's back and after my family.
Nope.
Not ringing any bells.
Look again.
I know we worked on him.
Well, it was a short-ass list, the ones that got away.
Let's see.
Well, he's got both his arms, so cross off the Chechen.
You know who it could be?
It could Six-Toes.
Six-Toes.
I forgot about Six-Toes.
Cried like a baby.
"I'm not gonna be able to walk anymore."
Please.
Hens can walk with three toes.
Anyway, that would be my guess.
Hard to tell with those boots he's wearing.
I'll check around, see if he's resurfaced, in which case you should get to him first because if he finds you, he's not gonna get even by just snipping off a few of yours toes.
Divorce suits a woman well.
I can see it in your hips there.
You're leaner and meaner. the men will come running, I promise you that.
That's very kind of you.
So, here's the thing.
I got money... republican money, the kind of money that wins elections.
And just like it is with dating, I want to spend it on the gal who I think's gonna put out for me.
You gonna put out for me, Mellie Grant, or are we just gonna rub jeans together and leave here frustrated?
Well, look, I know you've been lobbying for cutbacks at the EPA.
And while I probably shouldn't be offering you this...
"Cutbacks"?
Sweetheart, I'm looking to raze that building to the ground.
I'm an oil man, darling.
You promise me you'll consider pulling the plug on that there travesty,
I'll write a check right now for half a billion dollars.
You know I can't promise you that.
Well, I guess I'll have to go talk to that other little cupcake, see how far up her skirt she's willing to let me go.
Look...
No.
The man's being courted as we speak.
The man's a disease.
I'm not letting him infect Susan.
Sir, I understand the two of you have a history, but we need him on our side.
So he can pander to his special interests?
This is our chance to cut Mellie off at the knees.
Her campaign's financial picture is just plain sad.
She needs Hollis Doyle's money more than anyone, which is exactly why we need to keep her from getting it.
It can't hurt to cripple the competition.
Unless it backfires.
It's Hollis Doyle.
It comes with strings attached.
Worth the risk, if you ask me.
Set up a meeting.
- You were right.
- What?
Cyrus Beene is cheating on the President.
I don't mean literally.
Well, of course you don't mean literally.
That wouldn't make any sense.
Anyway, Cyrus and Frankie Vargas have been in contact a lot...
Phone calls, dinner.
Well, after the shooting, Vargas came to the White House, so a certain amount of... 27 phone calls mobile to mobile.
And Cyrus was in Harrisburg two weeks ago.
Harrisburg?
It seems like Cyrus is in bed with two different men.
What the hell does that mean?
I'm in bed with two different women...
literally.
And we're done here.
Do you know what it took for me to get that information?
I need your help, Abby.
Who are they?
One is horrible, wicked, cruel, possibly an actual witch.
The other is a wonderful person.
This sounds like a real dilemma.
Okay, yes, but one, you know, satisfies me.
You need help.
Bad news...
Hollis is meeting with Susan.
Liv?
That's fine.
He'll be her problem now.
But it's so much money.
There's always more money.
Where?
Kickstarter?
Well-meaning relatives?
Is this when the money's finally gonna start rolling in, Liv?
No need to panic, Mellie.
It's early days.
A presidential campaign is a marathon.
Maybe if you sat down with Hollis.
No.
Thanks for nothing.
Show's over.
This is pathetic, low.
No, it's just sad.
You have some truly detestable qualities about you, but I never thought jealousy was one of them.
I'm not jealous.
Then explain this to me, all of this, why you're holed up like a conspiracy kook spying on the head of the NSA.
I want to know why you chose her, how she fits into whatever you and my father are planning.
Man, he really messed you up.
The way my father raised me has allowed me...
Not your father...
Fitz.
You walked away from him over and over, time after time, because you knew in your gut, you knew if you said yes, he'd own you, he'd consume you, he'd be no different than your father,
but over time, Fitz manipulated you.
He made you feel like...
Like you owed him.
It's what he does best.
You knew that more than anyone, and you still fell for it.
Man, that has got to turn your world upside down, to go from being the smartest person in the room to the biggest fool... to realize you're just another textbook example of daddy issues, played out on a national stage.
But I am in love, Olivia.
I am marrying a woman I love.
She's smart, she's beautiful, and best of all, she's capable of loving me back.
Your girlfriends aren't girlfriends.
They're marks.
Nothing you do is real.
I must be plotting something because Vanessa likes Hugh Grant movies, she reads Vogue and takes multivitamins.
But, Liv, that is precisely what I want.
Yeah, one more thing before I go...
Did you enjoy it, hmm?
Watching us?
Did you pretend that you were her?
Did you get off when she got off?
Oh, you're here.
Why would I not be here?
This is my office, Red.
I thought you'd be in the meeting on Hollis Doyle.
I thought you'd be in the meeting on Hollis Doyle.
Nope.
I'm on something else...
Frankie Vargas.
Vargas?
Right...
The Harrisburg Hero, The Capitol Tackle.
I thought his 15 minutes were up.
He announced he's running for president today, didn't he?
He did.
Good luck to him on that.
Should we release a statement?
- On Vargas?
- On Vargas.
I don't think that's necessary, Red.
We're out of the election game.
Are you?
What?
Out of the election game.
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about you working with Frankie Vargas.
You've been talking to him on the phone.
He's the governor of a major state.
What other governor have you spoken with 27 times on your mobile phone in the last two weeks?
What other governor became a national hero by tackling a madman?
And how do you know who I've been talking to?
You've been to Harrisburg recently.
My niece lives in Harrisburg.
You're lying.
How dare you?
!
Do you realize how outrageous this is, coming in here and accusing me of lying, of working with Frankie Vargas to run for President?
He's a democrat.
He wants free college.
You've lost your mind, Red, and I will have your job.
You've insulted me.
You've violated me, tracking my calls, my travel.
You messed up!
I talked with him on the phone about coming to the White House.
I tried to align our education platforms.
I met him for dinner once.
That's it.
I've never seen the man other than that.
You're lying.
I'm telling the president.
He wanted some advice, okay?
I gave him some advice.
I tried to offer him some help.
That was it.
It was a few conversations.
- You're lying.
- Damn it!
No.
Yes.
Okay.
He...
He wanted more.
He wanted me to run his campaign.
He asked me to run his campaign.
I didn't go to him.
He asked me.
And it never went any further than that, I promise you.
I never violated my oath to the president.
- You're lying.
- No, no.
Please.
Please.
Abby.
Abby!
I'm sorry!
I've made a terrible mistake here.
You're right.
You're right.
But I will make it right.
I promise you, Abby.
Look at me.
Look at me.
It's over.
It is over, okay?
Please do not tell the president.
Everything we've been through.
Do not give up on me.
I beg you.
This job is everything to me.
I lost it once.
I can't lose it again.
Please.
Okay.
Hey, Robin.
What are you doing here?
Looking for Huck.
He around?
Do you see anyone around, anyone except me?
Liv's not around.
Huck's not around.
It's just me who's around, Charlie.
Geez.
What's with the 'tude?
Uh, Huck was here for a minute, and then he took off.
What do you need?
He wanted me to look into this dude.
He had some theory that he was a fellow we tortured back in the day.
Don't know what his name was on the way in.
It was Six-Toes on the way out.
Intel came back saying he's a car salesman in Frederick, but that could just be his cover.
Who's he?
- Lover.
- No one.
Look, have you talked to Huck?
Where'd you get this?
Why?
Huck saw this guy hanging out with his son and ex-wife.
I could tell he was upset.
Uh, am I missing something here?
What's the problem?
Dead battery?
Not sure exactly.
Some light came on, and then the car just died.
These cars nowadays can drive themselves, but they can't seem to fix themselves.
You know anything about computers?
Yee.
Not really.
I'm old school.
Yeah.
Me too.
Next time, I'm going full diesel.
Yeah, my... my phone's missing, too.
I must have left it someplace.
I can bring you to a gas station if you want.
Thanks, man.
My name's Sean.
Hey.
Harold.
All right.
Mr. President!
Hollis.
Thanks for coming.
Oh, it's not every day
I get invited to the big house, now, is it?
At least, not anymore.
Ohh!
Susan, Hollis was just in your home state last week.
Oversaw a completion of 17 new rigs we got out there.
Isn't Virginia just lovely?
Mm.
It'd be a little lovelier if the EPA wasn't crawling up my tooter every damn minute with their so-called regulations.
You might not know this about me, Hollis, but my father was a coal miner, as was his father and his and, oh, his father, too.
How 'bout that.
Love me a country girl.
Country girl wants something, she goes for it, works hard for it, not like those out-of-touch, rich folks born with silver spoon in their mouth, never worked for nothing in their lives.
Right, Fitz?
Oh, come on, now.
I'm talking 'bout myself, Mr. President.
Anyway, I am all for the environment, but I'm also for the economy, too, you know?
I do know, Suzy.
Offshore oil drilling, natural gas development off the Atlantic...
It comes with nearly 300,000 jobs and up to $24 billion to our nation's economy alone.
Don't forget about $51 billion in government revenue.
Provided there are no accidents.
Mr. President.
Deepwater Horizon, Exxon Valdez.
Tell me what those did for our economy again?
Let's not get be distracted by a few minor...
You don't have to do this, Susan.
You don't have to say the things you think he wants to hear, the things I know you don't honestly believe.
- Now, wait a minute.
- What do you want, Hollis?
Let's just cut the chitchat and get right to the point.
I think we might be getting ahead of ourselves.
Because we don't need you or your money to win an election.
I know I didn't.
You must be talking about your second term, right?
'Cause I'm sure you remember how you won your first.
You know what?
We're done here.
Your ex-husband was downright rude to me.
Hm.
San Antonio rude!
So I'm gonna give you another chance to bend my ear.
How's that sound?
Sounds great.
Now, let's dig into the issue of them freeloading illegals.
I can't even...
Cyrus is working for a democrat?
Cyrus Beene?
He says it's over, that he was just considering the job with Vargas, not working for him.
And you believe him?
Well, I want to believe him, but come on.
It's Cyrus.
If he's breathing, he's lying.
The thing is...
I have him, Liv.
Oh.
So, that's a good thing to you now?
I can see it.
It's right there in front of me, like this shining path.
I know exactly what to do, what steps to take, how to make it happen, like...
like I was built for it.
I have him.
I have Cyrus.
I just know...
How to take that information and use it against him, bury him.
Crush him, destroy him, slit his throat and bathe in his blood.
You want his job.
You want to be the White House chief of staff.
Hell yeah.
I want to run that mother.
And you don't think you should wait your turn?
Cyrus has been a great friend to me.
He's also one of the worst human beings on the planet.
That doesn't answer my question.
It does.
A good person would wait their turn.
But a Cyrus wouldn't.
A true monster would never wait.
A monster cuts in line.
A monster takes.
And you and I both know that this town is run by monsters.
They have the power.
The biggest dogs with the sharpest teeth own the room.
So, how long should I wait?
How long do you think it'll be before a big dog will rip my throat out and take my spot in line?
But how do the big dogs sleep at night?
I mean, what if I do this and I can't sleep at night?
Abby...
You're a good person.
You're just standing too close to the Oval.
You can feel the power, and you want it.
Everyone does.
But don't...
Don't let that place corrupt you.
Once you drive that stake through Cyrus's heart, there will be no turning back.
Once you take the white hat off, it's gone.
You will no longer be you.
And the thing is, being a big dog isn't as great as it seems.
Be a better person.
Okay?
What?
Any idea where he went?
I'm tracking his GPS.
Hopefully we get to him before he gets to Sean Barton.
- Sean Barton?
- Kim's new boyfriend.
He sells cars in Frederick, home-brews as a hobby.
Huck saw him with Kim and Javi.
I knew he was upset.
I didn't think he was that upset.
You should have told me he was spying on his family.
He was watching his kid play a soccer game.
I didn't think it was a big deal.
I also didn't know he was a government-trained assassin.
Well, I really appreciate you helping me out, Harold.
I'm supposed to meet my girlfriend and her son.
Yeah, no problem.
You two, um...
You two been dating long?
Only a few months.
She's great.
And her son's the best.
You got kids?
Not anymore.
Oh.
I...
Wow.
I'm so sorry, Harold.
Sometimes things just happen.
Hey, man, I think you just passed the gas station.
Harold?
The name's not Harold.
And yours isn't Sean.
So, you're saying we should actually embrace those that want to tear this country down?
I'm saying if we keep telling certain people they don't belong here, then how can we expect them to not hate us?
I mean, didn't we learn that in preschool, to treat others like we want to be treated?
That's why early education is so important, by the way.
That's why I want to not only support, but expand pre-K programs.
You think the voters are gonna go for that?
I'm making it the bedrock of my campaign.
"Embrace America's Tomorrow."
I'm even announcing my candidacy in my old elementary school.
So they better.
I'll have my people call yours in the morning.
Let's embrace America's tomorrow together.
What now?
I don't know.
We are definitely too late.
This guy...
Sean. is bleeding out on some tarp right now while Huck eats a turkey sandwich and hums Army tunes.
I cannot believe you didn't tell me what he was up to.
I didn't know he ate people for a living 'cause, per usual,
I'm the last one to know anything, despite the fact I've done nothing but prove myself a valuable member of this team.
He's right.
He's right?
You need to start treating him like part of the family because he is.
You're serious.
You...
You actually said that with a straight face?
Family?
What family, huh?
I see three strangers standing on the side of the road, fingers crossed, hoping their coworker didn't murder someone.
Yeah, we're just a regular Brady Bunch.
You know, we used to be a family, crazy, dysfunctional, worked 23-hour days...
Me, you, Harrison, Abby, Huck.
We had that.
But you can't stand here in this moment, look me in the eye, and say that's what you see.
When was the last time you asked Huck about Kim and Javi?
Do you think it's cool that not too long ago,
Huck begged me to put a gun to his head and blow his brains out?
I think you know the answer to that.
I really don't.
Family doesn't abandon one another.
You abandoned us for him, for the White House.
And since you've been back, your head is nowhere in the game.
You spend more of your time spying on your other ex-boyfriend.
You have a job.
You wanted more responsibility.
You have it.
I take care of you.
I never claimed to be a babysitter.
When I started, after Harrison asked me if I wanted to be a gladiator in a suit,
I got to watch a woman I was in awe of... a woman so fierce, she could breathe fire and would turn whatever was in front of her to dust.
Get the keys, Marcus.
We're leaving.
And still she'd find time to do something thoughtful, like buy an engagement ring for a coworker because she knew he'd never do it on his own.
That's family!
The keys, Marcus!
The keys!
Why do you hate us?
Answer the question, Liv!
What did we do to deserve this treatment?
I'm talking to you, Liv!
Liv!
I was kidnapped!
Do you know what that means?
They took everything from me, everything, my freedom, my dignity!
And I could have just quit.
I could have laid down and died, but I didn't.
I took my life back!
I stood up!
And a year after being sold on the auction block,
I was sitting in the Oval with the president of the United States, and I was running the country!
I'm selfish because I can be.
I'm selfish because, for a week of my life,
I lost that right, and I never, ever, ever want to feel that way again.
Guys.
I don't owe anyone anything!
It's my turn!
- Guys.
- Mine!
Guys!
It wasn't him.
Abby.
I have the new draft of your WTO statement.
Thanks.
I'll give it a read later.
Anything else?
Yes.
Advance BLS numbers for the month and a report from the Corps of Engineers on the Mississippi flood.
Does Cyrus have these?
No.
Let's get him copies.
No.
What?
He's working for Frankie Vargas.
What are you talking about?
Cyrus is working for Frankie Vargas.
He's running Vargas' presidential campaign.
You know this?
I know this, Mr. President.
You can ask me how, and I will lay it out for you, but trust me...
I know this.
Thank you, Abby.
That's it?
Thank you, Abby.
What are you going to do?
I don't know.
Your republican White House chief of staff is working for the democratic governor of Pennsylvania.
No, not working for...
Kingmaking.
He's kingmaking Vargas, creating a president for the other side, from right here inside the White House, right down the hall, outside this oval, your oval.
He's a turncoat.
You don't let that stand.
That is not how it is done.
And how is it done, Abby?
I announce to the nation that I'm dismissing my most trusted political advisor because he's actually working for Frankie Vargas?
How's that gonna look?
And in the middle of all this,
I'm trying to help Susan become president, but that suddenly seems pointless because I'm gonna spend the critical months of the campaign explaining away this mess and looking for a new chief of staff.
Cyrus has me.
Cyrus wins again.
You think this is easy?
This is not easy.
Mr. President, Cyrus doesn't have you.
He needs you.
You've got what he wants...
A graceful exit.
If you expose him as a turncoat, yeah, it'll be messy for you, but it will destroy him.
He loses his job here, but better...
He can't work for Vargas.
A man with Vargas's reputation for integrity can't be associated with that kind of low treachery.
However, if you allow Cyrus to depart amicably, if you accept his resignation, he's safe.
He can decide to work for Vargas after leaving the White House.
You neutralize him, you keep the optics in your favor.
You win.
And you don't have to spend a single second looking for a new chief of staff.
I'm right here, I'm exceedingly qualified,
I will raise my sword, run at the enemy, and fight the good fight every single day.
I will be the best West Wing general you've ever wished for and the scariest monster you never knew you needed.
I'm loyal, I'm tough, and I'm not afraid to tell you when you're wrong, and you are wrong right now.
Because it is easy, Mr. President.
Fire him.
Hire me.
Let me know when it's done.
Yes, Mr. President.
When what is done?
When you fire him.
You want me to fire Cyrus?
You want the job?
That's the job.
I'll let you know when it's done, sir.
He's gonna wake up with his hands on the steering wheel thinking that he fell asleep at the wheel.
He won't remember a thing.
I thought he was Six-Toes.
You what?
I thought he was this guy who wanted revenge for what I did to him a long time ago.
But he's just Sean.
He loves Javi and Kim.
They've been dating for a while.
He has a... a ring in his pocket that he's planning to give to her.
It's...
It's nice.
Sean is good for her.
I needed to come down here and be the hero, save Javi and Kim.
But he's not Six-Toes.
He's just Sean.
It's time for me to let go of them, let go of my family.
Huck.
No.
It is.
I have to let them go.
Sean's a good guy.
It's time to move on.
It's time.
I would like to officially announce that I am throwing my hat in the ring and running for president of the greatest country on God's green Earth, the United States of America!
You know...
You know why I'm announcing at my old elementary school?
Hell no.
Because you want to end racism?
You want to end poverty?
Then this is the place to start, so we all can embrace America's tomorrow!
He stole my platform, my slogan, my tag line, word for freaking word!
These kids are gonna have to work hard.
No shortcuts.
And if you're some pesky little border-crosser... sad, little refugee begging for a handout... you will not be welcome!
No, sir!
This is America's tomorrow, not yours!
You slimy, slithering, hell-raised son of a whore.
Thank y'all for coming!
Thank y'all for coming!
God bless y'all, and God bless the United States of America!
Hollis Doyle running for President!
This ought to be fun!
For you, maybe, but not for me.
I'm the candidate.
I'm the one that's gonna have to go out and debate that man.
Hollis is a joke.
No one will take him seriously.
I assure you he's not gonna be a problem.
Oh, he wouldn't have been if you hadn't felt the need to start...
And excuse my French...
A pissing match with him over EPA regulations, an issue that I actually agree with Hollis Doyle on,
I might add!
Susan.
He could have been kept on a leash.
Instead, he's gonna make a circus of this campaign and upend our entire Mellie-focused strategy, a strategy that we worked on very hard, a winning strategy!
You do not yell at me in this office.
Where do I yell at you?
I want to go there.
Take me to the place where I yell at you because I am not done!
- Why don't we...
- Get out!
I respect you.
I respect your authority in here.
But outside the gates, I'm the candidate.
This is The Susan Ross Show, sir.
It's because of you.
What?
The reason I can be selfish, the reason I can turn my back.
You held things together when I went to the island with Jake.
You ran this place when I left for the White House, and I didn't think twice about leaving you alone because I know, no matter where I am or what I'm doing, you'll jump in.
You'll do whatever you have to.
You'll take care of everyone.
You'll handle the situation.
Island?
After Liv found out her mom was a terrorist and her dad killed the president's son, she went to a secluded island with Jake.
Is there anything else you want to know?
Quinn, have you ever killed anyone?
I think that's enough sharing for today.
Another runaway success at the morning briefing, Red.
You made America care about the WTO.
What?
I need your badge.
You told him?
And I suggest you start collecting all of your personal effects, transfer any relevant contacts to your personal cell because White House security will be here in 15 minutes to sweep your room, wipe your computer, collect your phone and tablet.
I can't believe you told him.
They wanted to come now, but I bought you 15 minutes.
How kind.
I'm sorry, Cyrus.
I'd like to call a truce.
A truce?
I'd like us to stop with all the crazy.
Liv, I never started.
This was you.
It was me, all me.
You're right.
Can you say that again, a little louder this time?
Jake.
I'm just saying, it's not every day that...
I miss you.
That's why I've been acting like this, with the cameras and the stalking and the...
It's because I miss you.
Okay.
I know how selfish it was to have him and to have you, to not choose, to be okay with getting one thing from him and another...
From me.
I'm sorry, Jake.
Sorry I'm late.
Don't think about it.
Mwah!
Mm-hmm.
Absolutely.
Abby.
Want to join us for a drink?
I'd love to, sir.
I'll get us some drinks.
What are you having?
Oh, champagne for me, please.
Liv, how about you?
Uh.
Do you see this crack on my screen?
A guy runs into you in a public place.
That is there because this klutz crashed into me when I was standing in line at the Shake Shack.
It seems random, casual.
He flirts a little and then, what a surprise, you run into him again.
I could not believe it when I saw him a few days later at that café in Georgetown.
I didn't let him get away that time.
Another crack?
You know, this thing's gonna stop working pretty soon.
Liv, drink?
I wish I could, but I can't stay.
You sure?
There's a crisis at work.
I'll let you two enjoy your evening.
It was nice to see you both.
Thanks for stopping by, Liv.
Quinn, let's step up our surveillance on Jake.
[Laughter]
Mmm.
It's delicious.
Olivia, I love it.
I'm so glad.
It's their signature cake... 20 layers of crepes, each one lined with just the perfect amount of pastry cream.
Dad, what do you think?
[Chuckles]
I think I've never heard you describe a dessert before.
[Camera shutter clicking]
Have you chosen a venue yet?
Jake wants to get married at my parents' place on the Vineyard, even though it is the site of a famous shipwreck.
Ah, she's insanely superstitious.
- Do you see this crack on my screen?
- Yes.
That is there because this klutz crashed into me when I was standing in line at the Shake Shack.
[Laughs]
Jake wants me to toss it, but because it's how we met,
I insist on keeping it.
Ah, superstitious and sentimental.
I could not believe it when I saw him a few days later at that café in Georgetown.
I didn't let him get away that time.
[Laughter]
I'm sure that you already know this, but Jake, he just thinks the world of you.
How did you describe her again?
Uh, the sister I never had.
[Chuckles]
[Cellphone chimes]
- _ - [Camera shutter clicking]
Everything okay?
Uh, work emergency.
I have to go.
You have it?
Is the feed up?
Yeah.
They've just entered the building.
I see you, Vanessa Moss.
Hide your wallet, update your spam filter, and unplug your phone, for that stampede you hear thundering over the hill is the voracious and unyielding herd of candidates and their fundraisers, all just looking to pick your pockets clean
of every hard-earned dollar you got.
The most offensive of this year's crop of snake-oil salesman...
Governor Francisco Vargas, the two-faced democrat who had the nerve to come before you, lovers of "Liberty", on this very stage and swear to yours truly not to enter the presidential race.
Governor Vargas?
No chance in hell.
I don't know.
It's not impossible.
Damn near.
They said the same thing about Grant when he first ran, and Vargas is polling better with women than Grant was at this stage.
You're thinking about working for Vargas.
You're jumping ship.
No.
I could never leave Cyrus.
It's okay to be looking out for yourself.
You're gonna be out of a job in a year.
I mean, if Cyrus were to run Vargas' campaign, then I'd jump ship.
Cyrus running Vargas?
Who put that idea in your head?
I'm leaving now.
Okay.
I have five minutes.
- I've got four.
- Where's the coffee?
- You were supposed to bring the coffee.
- I don't do that anymore.
- What do you mean, "anymore"?
- I'm running OPA.
I don't have time to bring the coffee anymore.
You think the press secretary has time to bring the coffee?
- What do you need?
- A favor.
I need you to look into Cyrus for me.
I need to know what he's been up to, where he's been going, who's he's been calling.
- I can't.
- Why not?
Because, as I said, I'm running OPA.
Yeah.
Does Olivia know you're saying that?
Of course not.
Olivia's been holed up in her apartment watching a video feed of Jake and his new girlfriend.
She has no idea what anyone's been saying or doing.
She's not stalking.
She's focusing on something she thinks is important.
On something that's not her real, actual job.
Keep pretend-running OPA, Quinn.
I'll find someone else to help me.
Next time don't forget the coffee.
Yeppers.
Yes!
[Chuckles]
If Javi makes this...
I know.
They go to finals.
Stop putting added pressure on him.
[Keys clacking]
- Yes!
- [Grunts]
- Yes!
- [Grunts]
Who's that?
That your ex?
Yeah.
That's Kim.
Is that Kim's boyfriend?
Maybe.
Maybe?
Did you know about him?
Yeah, of course.
It's just the first time I've seen the guy.
[Cellphone chimes]
Mellie.
What would you think about changing our environmental platform?
Please tell me you're not taking that meeting.
I'm not.
Mellie, I told you not to meet with him.
I know you think he's the devil and all, but...
I don't think he's the devil.
I know he's the devil, as do you.
Maybe, he's changed.
Well, screw me sideways.
[Laughing] Hollis.
Don't promise him anything.
I have to go.
[Chuckles] It is so good to see you again.
Likewise!
[Laughs]
[Keys clacking]
Remember this guy we tried to kill?
I think he's back and after my family.
Nope.
Not ringing any bells.
Look again.
I know we worked on him.
Well, it was a short-ass list, the ones that got away.
Let's see.
Well, he's got both his arms, so cross off the Chechen.
You know who it could be?
It could Six-Toes.
Six-Toes.
I forgot about Six-Toes.
Cried like a baby.
"I'm not gonna be able to walk anymore."
Please.
Hens can walk with three toes.
Anyway, that would be my guess.
Hard to tell with those boots he's wearing.
I'll check around, see if he's resurfaced, in which case you should get to him first because if he finds you, he's not gonna get even by just snipping off a few of yours toes.
Divorce suits a woman well.
I can see it in your hips there.
You're leaner and meaner. the men will come running, I promise you that.
[Both laugh]
That's very kind of you. [Laughs]
[Clears throat] So, here's the thing.
I got money... republican money, the kind of money that wins elections.
And just like it is with dating, I want to spend it on the gal who I think's gonna put out for me.
You gonna put out for me, Mellie Grant, or are we just gonna rub jeans together and leave here frustrated?
[Laughs]
[Sighs]
Well, look, I know you've been lobbying for cutbacks at the EPA.
And while I probably shouldn't be offering you this...
[Laughs] "Cutbacks"?
Sweetheart, I'm looking to raze that building to the ground.
I'm an oil man, darling.
You promise me you'll consider pulling the plug on that there travesty,
I'll write a check right now for half a billion dollars.
You know I can't promise you that.
Well, I guess I'll have to go talk to that other little cupcake, see how far up her skirt she's willing to let me go.
Look...
[Camera shutter clicking]
No.
The man's being courted as we speak.
The man's a disease.
I'm not letting him infect Susan.
Sir, I understand the two of you have a history, but we need him on our side.
So he can pander to his special interests?
This is our chance to cut Mellie off at the knees.
Her campaign's financial picture is just plain sad.
She needs Hollis Doyle's money more than anyone, which is exactly why we need to keep her from getting it.
It can't hurt to cripple the competition.
Abby:
Unless it backfires.
It's Hollis Doyle.
It comes with strings attached.
Worth the risk, if you ask me.
Set up a meeting.
[Sighs]
- You were right.
- What?
Cyrus Beene is cheating on the President.
I don't mean literally.
Well, of course you don't mean literally.
That wouldn't make any sense.
Anyway, Cyrus and Frankie Vargas have been in contact a lot...
Phone calls, dinner.
Well, after the shooting, Vargas came to the White House, so a certain amount of... 27 phone calls mobile to mobile.
And Cyrus was in Harrisburg two weeks ago.
Harrisburg?
It seems like Cyrus is in bed with two different men.
What the hell does that mean?
I'm in bed with two different women...
literally.
And we're done here.
Do you know what it took for me to get that information?
I need your help, Abby.
[Sighs]
Who are they?
One is horrible, wicked, cruel, possibly an actual witch.
The other is a wonderful person.
This sounds like a real dilemma.
Okay, yes, but one, you know, satisfies me.
You need help.
[Camera shutter clicking]
Bad news...
Hollis is meeting with Susan.
Liv?
That's fine.
He'll be her problem now.
But it's so much money.
There's always more money.
Where?
Kickstarter?
Well-meaning relatives?
Is this when the money's finally gonna start rolling in, Liv?
No need to panic, Mellie.
It's early days.
A presidential campaign is a marathon.
Maybe if you sat down with Hollis.
No.
Thanks for nothing.

[Knocking on door]
Show's over.
This is pathetic, low.
No, it's just sad.
You have some truly detestable qualities about you, but I never thought jealousy was one of them.
I'm not jealous.
Then explain this to me, all of this, why you're holed up like a conspiracy kook spying on the head of the NSA.
I want to know why you chose her, how she fits into whatever you and my father are planning.
Man, he really messed you up.
The way my father raised me has allowed me...
Not your father...
Fitz.
You walked away from him over and over, time after time, because you knew in your gut, you knew if you said yes, he'd own you, he'd consume you, he'd be no different than your father,
but over time, Fitz manipulated you.
He made you feel like...
Like you owed him.
It's what he does best.
You knew that more than anyone, and you still fell for it.
Man, that has got to turn your world upside down, to go from being the smartest person in the room to the biggest fool... to realize you're just another textbook example of daddy issues, played out on a national stage.
But I am in love, Olivia.
I am marrying a woman I love.
She's smart, she's beautiful, and best of all, she's capable of loving me back.
Your girlfriends aren't girlfriends.
They're marks.
Nothing you do is real.
I must be plotting something because Vanessa likes Hugh Grant movies, she reads Vogue and takes multivitamins.
But, Liv, that is precisely what I want.
[Sighs]
Yeah, one more thing before I go...
Did you enjoy it, hmm?
Watching us?
Did you pretend that you were her?
Did you get off when she got off?
[Door closes]
Oh, you're here.
Why would I not be here?
This is my office, Red.
I thought you'd be in the meeting on Hollis Doyle.
I thought you'd be in the meeting on Hollis Doyle.
Nope.
I'm on something else...
Frankie Vargas.
Vargas?
Right...
The Harrisburg Hero, The Capitol Tackle.
I thought his 15 minutes were up.
He announced he's running for president today, didn't he?
He did.
[Chuckles] Good luck to him on that.
Should we release a statement?
- On Vargas?
- On Vargas.
I don't think that's necessary, Red.
We're out of the election game.
Are you?
What?
Out of the election game.
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about you working with Frankie Vargas.
You've been talking to him on the phone.
He's the governor of a major state.
What other governor have you spoken with 27 times on your mobile phone in the last two weeks?
What other governor became a national hero by tackling a madman?
And how do you know who I've been talking to?
You've been to Harrisburg recently.
My niece lives in Harrisburg.
You're lying.
How dare you?
!
Do you realize how outrageous this is, coming in here and accusing me of lying, of working with Frankie Vargas to run for President?
He's a democrat.
He wants free college.
You've lost your mind, Red, and I will have your job.
You've insulted me.
You've violated me, tracking my calls, my travel.
You messed up!
I talked with him on the phone about coming to the White House.
I tried to align our education platforms.
I met him for dinner once.
That's it.
I've never seen the man other than that.
You're lying.
I'm telling the president.
[Scoffs]
He wanted some advice, okay?
I gave him some advice.
I tried to offer him some help.
That was it.
It was a few conversations.
- You're lying.
- Damn it!
No.
Yes.
Okay.
He...
He wanted more.
He wanted me to run his campaign.
He asked me to run his campaign.
I didn't go to him.
He asked me.
And it never went any further than that, I promise you.
I never violated my oath to the president.
- You're lying.
- No, no.
Please.
Please.
Abby.
Abby!
I'm sorry!
I've made a terrible mistake here.
You're right.
You're right.
But I will make it right.
I promise you, Abby.
Look at me.
Look at me.
It's over.
It is over, okay?
Please do not tell the president.
Everything we've been through.
Do not give up on me.
I beg you.
This job is everything to me.
I lost it once.
I can't lose it again.
Please.
Okay.
[Camera shutter clicking]
Hey, Robin.
What are you doing here?
Looking for Huck.
He around?
[Sighs] Do you see anyone around, anyone except me?
Liv's not around.
Huck's not around.
It's just me who's around, Charlie.
Geez.
What's with the 'tude?
Uh, Huck was here for a minute, and then he took off.
What do you need?
He wanted me to look into this dude.
He had some theory that he was a fellow we tortured back in the day.
Don't know what his name was on the way in.
It was Six-Toes on the way out.
[Clicks tongue]
Intel came back saying he's a car salesman in Frederick, but that could just be his cover.
Who's he?
- Lover.
- No one.
Look, have you talked to Huck?
Where'd you get this?
Why?
Huck saw this guy hanging out with his son and ex-wife.
I could tell he was upset.
Uh, am I missing something here?
What's the problem?
Dead battery?
Not sure exactly.
Some light came on, and then the car just died.
These cars nowadays can drive themselves, but they can't seem to fix themselves.
[Chuckles]
You know anything about computers?
Yee.
Not really.
I'm old school.
Yeah.
Me too.
Next time, I'm going full diesel.
[Chuckles]
Yeah, my... my phone's missing, too.
I must have left it someplace.
I can bring you to a gas station if you want.
Thanks, man.
My name's Sean.
Hey.
Harold.
All right.
Mr. President!
Hollis.
Thanks for coming.
Oh, it's not every day
I get invited to the big house, now, is it?
At least, not anymore.
Ohh!
[Sighs]
Susan, Hollis was just in your home state last week.
Oversaw a completion of 17 new rigs we got out there.
Isn't Virginia just lovely?
Mm.
It'd be a little lovelier if the EPA wasn't crawling up my tooter every damn minute with their so-called regulations.
You might not know this about me, Hollis, but my father was a coal miner, as was his father and his and, oh, his father, too.
How 'bout that.
Love me a country girl.
Country girl wants something, she goes for it, works hard for it, not like those out-of-touch, rich folks born with silver spoon in their mouth, never worked for nothing in their lives.
Right, Fitz?
Oh, come on, now.
I'm talking 'bout myself, Mr. President.
Anyway, I am all for the environment, but I'm also for the economy, too, you know?
I do know, Suzy.
Offshore oil drilling, natural gas development off the Atlantic...
It comes with nearly 300,000 jobs and up to $24 billion to our nation's economy alone.
Don't forget about $51 billion in government revenue.
Provided there are no accidents.
Mr. President.
Deepwater Horizon, Exxon Valdez.
Tell me what those did for our economy again?
Let's not get be distracted by a few minor...
You don't have to do this, Susan.
You don't have to say the things you think he wants to hear, the things I know you don't honestly believe.
- Now, wait a minute.
- What do you want, Hollis?
Let's just cut the chitchat and get right to the point.
I think we might be getting ahead of ourselves.
Because we don't need you or your money to win an election.
I know I didn't.
You must be talking about your second term, right?
'Cause I'm sure you remember how you won your first.
You know what?
We're done here.
[Camera shutter clicking]
Your ex-husband was downright rude to me.
Hm.
San Antonio rude!
So I'm gonna give you another chance to bend my ear.
How's that sound?
Sounds great.
Now, let's dig into the issue of them freeloading illegals.
I can't even...
Cyrus is working for a democrat?
Cyrus Beene?
He says it's over, that he was just considering the job with Vargas, not working for him.
And you believe him?
Well, I want to believe him, but come on.
It's Cyrus.
If he's breathing, he's lying.
The thing is...
I have him, Liv.
Oh.
So, that's a good thing to you now?
I can see it.
It's right there in front of me, like this shining path.
I know exactly what to do, what steps to take, how to make it happen, like...
like I was built for it.
I have him.
I have Cyrus.
I just know...
How to take that information and use it against him, bury him.
Crush him, destroy him, slit his throat and bathe in his blood.
You want his job.
You want to be the White House chief of staff.
Hell yeah.
I want to run that mother.
And you don't think you should wait your turn?
Cyrus has been a great friend to me.
He's also one of the worst human beings on the planet.
That doesn't answer my question.
It does.
A good person would wait their turn.
But a Cyrus wouldn't.
A true monster would never wait.
A monster cuts in line.
A monster takes.
And you and I both know that this town is run by monsters.
They have the power.
The biggest dogs with the sharpest teeth own the room.
So, how long should I wait?
How long do you think it'll be before a big dog will rip my throat out and take my spot in line?
But how do the big dogs sleep at night?
I mean, what if I do this and I can't sleep at night?
Abby...
[Chuckles]
You're a good person.
You're just standing too close to the Oval.
You can feel the power, and you want it.
Everyone does.
But don't...
Don't let that place corrupt you.
Once you drive that stake through Cyrus's heart, there will be no turning back.
Once you take the white hat off, it's gone.
You will no longer be you.
And the thing is, being a big dog isn't as great as it seems.
Be a better person.
Okay?
[Cellphone chimes]
What?
Any idea where he went?
I'm tracking his GPS.
Hopefully we get to him before he gets to Sean Barton.
- Sean Barton?
- Kim's new boyfriend.
He sells cars in Frederick, home-brews as a hobby.
Huck saw him with Kim and Javi.
I knew he was upset.
I didn't think he was that upset.
You should have told me he was spying on his family.
He was watching his kid play a soccer game.
I didn't think it was a big deal.
I also didn't know he was a government-trained assassin.
[Alarm chirps]
Well, I really appreciate you helping me out, Harold.
I'm supposed to meet my girlfriend and her son.
Yeah, no problem.
You two, um...
You two been dating long?
Only a few months.
She's great.
And her son's the best.
You got kids?
Not anymore.
Oh.
I...
Wow.
I'm so sorry, Harold.
Sometimes things just happen.
Hey, man, I think you just passed the gas station.
Harold?
The name's not Harold.
And yours isn't Sean.
So, you're saying we should actually embrace those that want to tear this country down?
I'm saying if we keep telling certain people they don't belong here, then how can we expect them to not hate us?
I mean, didn't we learn that in preschool, to treat others like we want to be treated?
That's why early education is so important, by the way.
That's why I want to not only support, but expand pre-K programs.
You think the voters are gonna go for that?
I'm making it the bedrock of my campaign.
"Embrace America's Tomorrow."
I'm even announcing my candidacy in my old elementary school.
[Chuckles]
So they better.
[Chuckles]
[Chuckles]
I'll have my people call yours in the morning.
Let's embrace America's tomorrow together.
[Chuckles]
[Laughs]
What now?
I don't know.
We are definitely too late.
This guy...
Sean. is bleeding out on some tarp right now while Huck eats a turkey sandwich and hums Army tunes.
I cannot believe you didn't tell me what he was up to.
I didn't know he ate people for a living 'cause, per usual,
I'm the last one to know anything, despite the fact I've done nothing but prove myself a valuable member of this team.
He's right.
He's right?
You need to start treating him like part of the family because he is.
You're serious.
You...
You actually said that with a straight face?
Family?
What family, huh?
I see three strangers standing on the side of the road, fingers crossed, hoping their coworker didn't murder someone.
Yeah, we're just a regular Brady Bunch.
You know, we used to be a family, crazy, dysfunctional, worked 23-hour days...
Me, you, Harrison, Abby, Huck.
We had that.
But you can't stand here in this moment, look me in the eye, and say that's what you see.
When was the last time you asked Huck about Kim and Javi?
Do you think it's cool that not too long ago,
Huck begged me to put a gun to his head and blow his brains out?
I think you know the answer to that.
I really don't.
Family doesn't abandon one another.
You abandoned us for him, for the White House.
And since you've been back, your head is nowhere in the game.
You spend more of your time spying on your other ex-boyfriend.
You have a job.
You wanted more responsibility.
You have it.
I take care of you.
I never claimed to be a babysitter.
When I started, after Harrison asked me if I wanted to be a gladiator in a suit,
I got to watch a woman I was in awe of...
[Scoffs] a woman so fierce, she could breathe fire and would turn whatever was in front of her to dust.
Get the keys, Marcus.
We're leaving.
And still she'd find time to do something thoughtful, like buy an engagement ring for a coworker because she knew he'd never do it on his own.
That's family!
The keys, Marcus!
The keys!
Why do you hate us?
Answer the question, Liv!
What did we do to deserve this treatment?
I'm talking to you, Liv!
Liv!
I was kidnapped!
Do you know what that means?
They took everything from me, everything, my freedom, my dignity!
And I could have just quit.
I could have laid down and died, but I didn't.
I took my life back!
I stood up!
And a year after being sold on the auction block,
I was sitting in the Oval with the president of the United States, and I was running the country!
I'm selfish because I can be.
I'm selfish because, for a week of my life,
I lost that right, and I never, ever, ever want to feel that way again.
Guys.
I don't owe anyone anything!
It's my turn!
- Guys.
- Mine!
Guys!
It wasn't him.
[Camera shutter clicking]
Abby.
I have the new draft of your WTO statement.
Thanks.
I'll give it a read later.
Anything else?
Yes.
Advance BLS numbers for the month and a report from the Corps of Engineers on the Mississippi flood.
Does Cyrus have these?
No.
Let's get him copies.
No.
What?
He's working for Frankie Vargas.
What are you talking about?
Cyrus is working for Frankie Vargas.
He's running Vargas' presidential campaign.
You know this?
I know this, Mr. President.
You can ask me how, and I will lay it out for you, but trust me...
I know this.
Thank you, Abby.
That's it?
Thank you, Abby.
What are you going to do?
I don't know.
Your republican White House chief of staff is working for the democratic governor of Pennsylvania.
No, not working for...
Kingmaking.
He's kingmaking Vargas, creating a president for the other side, from right here inside the White House, right down the hall, outside this oval, your oval.
He's a turncoat.
You don't let that stand.
That is not how it is done.
And how is it done, Abby?
I announce to the nation that I'm dismissing my most trusted political advisor because he's actually working for Frankie Vargas?
How's that gonna look?
And in the middle of all this,
I'm trying to help Susan become president, but that suddenly seems pointless because I'm gonna spend the critical months of the campaign explaining away this mess and looking for a new chief of staff.
Cyrus has me.
Cyrus wins again.
You think this is easy?
This is not easy.
Mr. President, Cyrus doesn't have you.
He needs you.
You've got what he wants...
A graceful exit.
If you expose him as a turncoat, yeah, it'll be messy for you, but it will destroy him.
He loses his job here, but better...
He can't work for Vargas.
A man with Vargas's reputation for integrity can't be associated with that kind of low treachery.
However, if you allow Cyrus to depart amicably, if you accept his resignation, he's safe.
He can decide to work for Vargas after leaving the White House.
You neutralize him, you keep the optics in your favor.
You win.
And you don't have to spend a single second looking for a new chief of staff.
I'm right here, I'm exceedingly qualified,
I will raise my sword, run at the enemy, and fight the good fight every single day.
I will be the best West Wing general you've ever wished for and the scariest monster you never knew you needed.
I'm loyal, I'm tough, and I'm not afraid to tell you when you're wrong, and you are wrong right now.
Because it is easy, Mr. President.
Fire him.
Hire me.
Let me know when it's done.
Yes, Mr. President.
When what is done?
When you fire him.
You want me to fire Cyrus?
You want the job?
That's the job.
I'll let you know when it's done, sir.
He's gonna wake up with his hands on the steering wheel thinking that he fell asleep at the wheel.
He won't remember a thing.
I thought he was Six-Toes.
You what?
I thought he was this guy who wanted revenge for what I did to him a long time ago.
But he's just Sean.
He loves Javi and Kim.
They've been dating for a while.
He has a... a ring in his pocket that he's planning to give to her.
It's...
It's nice.
Sean is good for her.
I needed to come down here and be the hero, save Javi and Kim.
But he's not Six-Toes.
He's just Sean.
It's time for me to let go of them, let go of my family.
Huck.
No.
It is.
I have to let them go.
Sean's a good guy.
It's time to move on.
It's time.
I would like to officially announce that I am throwing my hat in the ring and running for president of the greatest country on God's green Earth, the United States of America!
[Cheers and applause]
You know...
You know why I'm announcing at my old elementary school?
Hell no.
Because you want to end racism?
You want to end poverty?
Then this is the place to start, so we all can embrace America's tomorrow!
He stole my platform, my slogan, my tag line, word for freaking word!
These kids are gonna have to work hard.
No shortcuts.
And if you're some pesky little border-crosser... sad, little refugee begging for a handout... you will not be welcome!
No, sir!
This is America's tomorrow, not yours!
You slimy, slithering, hell-raised son of a whore.
Thank y'all for coming!
Thank y'all for coming!
God bless y'all, and God bless the United States of America!
Hollis Doyle running for President!
This ought to be fun!
For you, maybe, but not for me.
I'm the candidate.
I'm the one that's gonna have to go out and debate that man.
Hollis is a joke.
No one will take him seriously.
I assure you he's not gonna be a problem.
Oh, he wouldn't have been if you hadn't felt the need to start...
And excuse my French...
A pissing match with him over EPA regulations, an issue that I actually agree with Hollis Doyle on,
I might add!
Susan.
He could have been kept on a leash.
Instead, he's gonna make a circus of this campaign and upend our entire Mellie-focused strategy, a strategy that we worked on very hard, a winning strategy!
You do not yell at me in this office.
Where do I yell at you?
I want to go there.
Take me to the place where I yell at you because I am not done!
- Why don't we...
- Get out!
[Door closes]
I respect you.
I respect your authority in here.
But outside the gates, I'm the candidate.
This is The Susan Ross Show, sir.
[Camera shutter clicking]
[Sighs]
It's because of you.
What?
The reason I can be selfish, the reason I can turn my back.
You held things together when I went to the island with Jake.
You ran this place when I left for the White House, and I didn't think twice about leaving you alone because I know, no matter where I am or what I'm doing, you'll jump in.
You'll do whatever you have to.
You'll take care of everyone.
You'll handle the situation.
[Sighs]
Island?
After Liv found out her mom was a terrorist and her dad killed the president's son, she went to a secluded island with Jake.
Is there anything else you want to know?
Quinn, have you ever killed anyone?
I think that's enough sharing for today.
Another runaway success at the morning briefing, Red.
You made America care about the WTO.
What?
I need your badge.
You told him?
And I suggest you start collecting all of your personal effects, transfer any relevant contacts to your personal cell because White House security will be here in 15 minutes to sweep your room, wipe your computer, collect your phone and tablet.
I can't believe you told him.
They wanted to come now, but I bought you 15 minutes.

Hide your wallet, update your spam filter, and unplug your phone, for that stampede you hear thundering over the hill is the voracious and unyielding herd of candidates and their fundraisers, all just looking to pick your pockets clean
of every hard-earned dollar you got.
The most offensive of this year's crop of snake-oil salesman -- Governor Francisco Vargas, the two-faced democrat who had the nerve to come before you, lovers of liberty, on this very stage and swear to yours truly
not to enter the presidential race.
Governor Vargas?
No chance in hell.
I don't know.
It's not impossible.
Damn near.
They said the same thing about Grant when he first ran, and Vargas is polling better with women than Grant was at this stage.
You're thinking about working for Vargas.
You're jumping ship.
No.
I could never leave Cyrus.
It's okay to be looking out for yourself.
You're gonna be out of a job in a year.
I mean, if Cyrus were to run Vargas' campaign, then I'd jump ship.
Cyrus running Vargas?
Who put that idea in your head?
I'm leaving now.
Okay.
I have five minutes.
-I've got four.
-Where's the coffee?
You were supposed to bring the coffee.
I don't do that anymore.
-What do you mean, "anymore"?
-I'm running OPA.
I don't have time to bring the coffee anymore.
You think the press secretary has time to bring the coffee?
-What do you need?
-A favor.
I need you to look into Cyrus for me.
I need to know what he's been up to, where he's been going, who's he's been calling.
-I can't.
-Why not?
Because, as I said, I'm running OPA.
Yeah.
Does Olivia know you're saying that?
Of course not.
Olivia's been holed up in her apartment watching a video feed of Jake and his new girlfriend.
She has no idea what anyone's been saying or doing.
She's not stalking.
She's focusing on something she thinks is important.

Nope.

I know we worked on him.
Well, it was a short-ass list, the ones that got away.
Let's see.
Well, he's got both his arms, so cross off the Chechen.
You know who it could be?
It could Six-Toes.
Six-Toes.
I forgot about Six-Toes.
Cried like a baby.
"I'm not gonna be able to walk anymore."
Please.
Hens can walk with three toes.
Anyway, that would be my guess.
Hard to tell with those boots he's wearing.
I'll check around, see if he's resurfaced, in which case you should get to him first because if he finds you, he's not gonna get even by just snipping off a few of yours toes.
Divorce suits a woman well.
I can see it in your hips there.

That's very kind of you.

I got money... republican money, the kind of money that wins elections.
And just like it is with dating, I want to spend it on the gal who I think's gonna put out for me.
You gonna put out for me, Mellie Grant, or are we just gonna rub jeans together and leave here frustrated?

Well, look, I know you've been lobbying for cutbacks at the EPA.
And while I probably shouldn't be offering you this --
[ Laughs ] "Cutbacks"?
Sweetheart, I'm looking to raze that building to the ground.
I'm an oil man, darling.
You promise me you'll consider pulling the plug on that there travesty,
I'll write a check right now for half a billion dollars.
You know I can't promise you that.
Well, I guess I'll have to go talk to that other little cupcake, see how far up her skirt she's willing to let me go.
Look --

No.
The man's being courted as we speak.
The man's a disease.
I'm not letting him infect Susan.
Sir, I understand the two of you have a history, but we need him on our side.
So he can pander to his special interests?
This is our chance to cut Mellie off at the knees.
Her campaign's financial picture is just plain sad.
She needs Hollis Doyle's money more than anyone, which is exactly why we need to keep her from getting it.
It can't hurt to cripple the competition.
Abby:
Unless it backfires.
It's Hollis Doyle.
It comes with strings attached.
Worth the risk, if you ask me.
Set up a meeting.
[ Sighs ]
-You were right.
-What?
Cyrus Beene is cheating on the President.
I don't mean literally.
Well, of course you don't mean literally.
That wouldn't make any sense.
Anyway, Cyrus and Frankie Vargas have been in contact a lot -- phone calls, dinner.
Well, after the shooting, Vargas came to the White House, so a certain amount of --
27 phone calls mobile to mobile.
And Cyrus was in Harrisburg two weeks ago.
Harrisburg?
It seems like Cyrus is in bed with two different men.
What the hell does that mean?
I'm in bed with two different women -- literally.
And we're done here.
Do you know what it took for me to get that information?
I need your help, Abby.
[ Sighs ]
Who are they?
One is horrible, wicked, cruel, possibly an actual witch.
The other is a wonderful person.
This sounds like a real dilemma.
Okay, yes, but one, you know, satisfies me.
You need help.
[ Camera shutter clicking ]
Bad news -- Hollis is meeting with Susan.
Liv?
That's fine.
He'll be her problem now.
But it's so much money.
There's always more money.
Where?
Kickstarter?
Well-meaning relatives?
Is this when the money's finally gonna start rolling in, Liv?
No need to panic, Mellie.
It's early days.
A presidential campaign is a marathon.
Maybe if you sat down with Hollis.
No.
Thanks for nothing.

I am marrying a woman I love.
She's smart, she's beautiful, and best of all, she's capable of loving me back.
Your girlfriends aren't girlfriends.
They're marks.
Nothing you do is real.
I must be plotting something because Vanessa likes Hugh Grant movies, she reads Vogue and takes multivitamins.
But, Liv, that is precisely what I want.
[ Sighs ]
Yeah, one more thing before I go --
Did you enjoy it, hmm?
Watching us?
Did you pretend that you were her?
Did you get off when she got off?
[ Door closes ]
Oh, you're here.
Why would I not be here?
This is my office, Red.
I thought you'd be in the meeting on Hollis Doyle.
I thought you'd be in the meeting on Hollis Doyle.
Nope.
I'm on something else -- Frankie Vargas.
Vargas?
Right -
- The Harrisburg Hero, The Capitol Tackle.
I thought his 15 minutes were up.
He announced he's running for president today, didn't he?
He did.
[ Chuckles ] Good luck to him on that.
Should we release a statement?
-On Vargas?
-On Vargas.
I don't think that's necessary, Red.
We're out of the election game.
Are you?
What?
Out of the election game.
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about you working with Frankie Vargas.
You've been talking to him on the phone.
He's the governor of a major state.
What other governor have you spoken with 27 times on your mobile phone in the last two weeks?
What other governor became a national hero by tackling a madman?
And how do you know who I've been talking to?
You've been to Harrisburg recently.
My niece lives in Harrisburg.
You're lying.
How dare you?
!
Do you realize how outrageous this is, coming in here and accusing me of lying, of working with Frankie Vargas to run for President?
He's a democrat.
He wants free college.
You've lost your mind, Red, and I will have your job.
You've insulted me.
You've violated me, tracking my calls, my travel.
You messed up!
I talked with him on the phone about coming to the White House.
I tried to align our education platforms.
I met him for dinner once.
That's it.
I've never seen the man other than that.
You're lying.
I'm telling the president.
[ Scoffs ]
He wanted some advice, okay?
I gave him some advice.
I tried to offer him some help.
That was it.
It was a few conversations.
-You're lying.
-Damn it!
No.
Yes.
Okay.
He -
- He wanted more.
He wanted me to run his campaign.
He asked me to run his campaign.
I didn't go to him.
Heaskedme .
And it never went any further than that, I promise you.
I never violated my oath to the president.
-You're lying.
-No, no.
Please.
Please.
Abby.
Abby!
I'm sorry!
I've made a terrible mistake here.
You're right.
You're right.
But I will make it right.
I promise you, Abby.
Look at me.
Look at me.
It's over.
It is over, okay?
Please do not tell the president.
Everything we've been through.
Do not give up on me.
I beg you.
This job is everything to me.
I lost it once.
I can't lose it again.
Please.
Okay.
[ Camera shutter clicking ]
Hey, Robin.
What are you doing here?
Looking for Huck.
He around?
[ Sighs ] Do you see anyone around, anyone except me?
Liv's not around.
Huck's not around.
It's just me who's around, Charlie.
Geez.
What's with the 'tude?
Uh, Huck was here for a minute, and then he took off.
What do you need?
He wanted me to look into this dude.
He had some theory that he was a fellow we tortured back in the day.
Don't know what his name was on the way in.
It was Six-Toes on the way out.
[ Clicks tongue ]
Intel came back saying he's a car salesman in Frederick, but that could just be his cover.
Who's he?
-Lover.
-No one.
Look, have you talked to Huck?
Where'd you get this?
Why?
Huck saw this guy hanging out with his son and ex-wife.
I could tell he was upset.
Uh, am I missing something here?
What's the problem?
Dead battery?
Not sure exactly.
Some light came on, and then the car just died.
These cars nowadays can drive themselves, but they can't seem to fix themselves.
[ Chuckles ]
You know anything about computers?
Yee.
Not really.
I'm old school.
Yeah.
Me too.
Next time, I'm going full diesel.
[ Chuckles ]
Yeah, my -- my phone's missing, too.
I must have left it someplace.
I can bring you to a gas station if you want.
Thanks, man.
My name's Sean.
Hey.
Harold.
All right.
Mr. President!
Hollis.
Thanks for coming.
Oh, it's not every day
I get invited to the big house, now, is it?
At least, not anymore.
Ohh!
[ Sighs ]
Susan, Hollis was just in your home state last week.
Oversaw a completion of 17 new rigs we got out there.
Isn't Virginia just lovely?
Mm.
It'd be a little lovelier if the EPA wasn't crawling up my tooter every damn minute with their so-called regulations.
You might not know this about me, Hollis, but my father was a coal miner, as was his father and his and, oh, his father, too.
How 'bout that.
Love me a country girl.
Country girl wants something, she goes for it, works hard for it, not like those out-of-touch, rich folks born with silver spoon in their mouth, never worked for nothing in their lives.
Right, Fitz?
Oh, come on, now.
I'm talking 'bout myself, Mr. President.
Anyway, I am all for the environment, but I'm also for the economy, too, you know?
I do know, Suzy.
Offshore oil drilling, natural gas development off the Atlantic -- it comes with nearly 300,000 jobs and up to $24 billion to our nation's economy alone.
Don't forget about $51 billion in government revenue.
Provided there are no accidents.
Mr. President.
Deepwater Horizon, ExxonValdez.
Tell me what those did for our economy again?
Let's not get be distracted by a few minor --
You don't have to do this, Susan.
You don't have to say the things you think he wants to hear, the things I know you don't honestly believe.
-Now, wait a minute.
-What do you want, Hollis?
Let's just cut the chitchat and get right to the point.
I think we might be getting ahead of ourselves.
Because we don't need you or your money to win an election.
I know I didn't.
You must be talking about your second term, right?
'Cause I'm sure you remember how you won your first.
You know what?
We're done here.
[ Camera shutter clicking ]
Your ex-husband was downright rude to me.
Hm.
San Antonio rude!
So I'm gonna give you another chance to bend my ear.
How's that sound?
Sounds great.
Now, let's dig into the issue of them freeloading illegals.
I can't even...
Cyrus is working for a democrat?
Cyrus Beene?
He says it's over, that he was just considering the job with Vargas, not working for him.
And you believe him?
Well, I want to believe him, but come on.
It's Cyrus.
If he's breathing, he's lying.
The thing is...
I have him, Liv.
Oh.
So, that's a good thing to you now?
I can see it.
It's right there in front of me, like this shining path.
I know exactly what to do, what steps to take, how to make it happen, like -- like I was built for it.
I have him.
I have Cyrus.
I just know --
How to take that information and use it against him, bury him.
Crush him, destroy him, slit his throat and bathe in his blood.
You want his job.
You want to be the White House chief of staff.
Hell yeah.
I want to run that mother.
And you don't think you should wait your turn?
Cyrus has been a great friend to me.
He's also one of the worst human beings on the planet.
That doesn't answer my question.
It does.
A good person would wait their turn.
But a Cyrus wouldn't.
A true monster would never wait.
A monster cuts in line.
A monster takes.
And you and I both know that this town is run by monsters.
They have the power.
The biggest dogs with the sharpest teeth own the room.
So, how long should I wait?
How long do you think it'll be before a big dog will rip my throat out and take my spot in line?
But how do the big dogs sleep at night?
I mean, what if I do this and I can't sleep at night?
Abby...
[ Chuckles ]
You're a good person.
You're just standing too close to the Oval.
You can feel the power, and you want it.
Everyone does.
But don't --
Don't let that place corrupt you.
Once you drive that stake through Cyrus's heart, there will be no turning back.
Once you take the white hat off, it's gone.
You will no longer be you.
And the thing is, being a big dog isn't as great as it seems.
Be a better person.
Okay?
[ Cellphone chimes ]
What?
Any idea where he went?
I'm tracking his GPS.
Hopefully we get to him before he gets to Sean Barton.
-Sean Barton?
-Kim's new boyfriend.
He sells cars in Frederick, home-brews as a hobby.
Huck saw him with Kim and Javi.
I knew he was upset.
I didn't think he was that upset.
You should have told me he was spying on his family.
He was watching his kid play a soccer game.
I didn't think it was a big deal.
I also didn't know he was a government-trained assassin.
[ Alarm chirps ]
Well, I really appreciate you helping me out, Harold.
I'm supposed to meet my girlfriend and her son.
Yeah, no problem.
You two, um...
You two been dating long?
Only a few months.
She's great.
And her son's the best.
You got kids?
Not anymore.
Oh.
I...
Wow.
I'm so sorry, Harold.
Sometimes things just happen.
Hey, man, I think you just passed the gas station.
Harold?
The name's not Harold.
And yours isn't Sean.
So, you're saying we should actually embrace those that want to tear this country down?
I'm saying if we keep telling certain people they don't belong here, then how can we expect them to not hate us?
I mean, didn't we learn that in preschool, to treat others like we want to be treated?
That's why early education is so important, by the way.
That's why I want to not only support, but expand pre-K programs.
You think the voters are gonna go for that?
I'm making it the bedrock of my campaign.
"Embrace America's Tomorrow."
I'm even announcing my candidacy in my old elementary school.
[ Chuckles ]
So they better.
[ Chuckles ]
[ Chuckles ]
I'll have my people call yours in the morning.
Let's embrace America's tomorrow together.
[ Chuckles ]
[ Laughs ]
What now?
I don't know.
We are definitely too late.
This guy...
Sean.
...is bleeding out on some tarp right now while Huck eats a turkey sandwich and hums Army tunes.
I cannot believe you didn't tell me what he was up to.
I didn't know he ate people for a living 'cause, per usual,
I'm the last one to know anything, despite the fact I've done nothing but prove myself a valuable member of this team.
He's right.
He's right?
You need to start treating him like part of the family because he is.
You're serious.
You -
- You actually said that with a straight face?
Family?
What family, huh?
I see three strangers standing on the side of the road, fingers crossed, hoping their coworker didn't murder someone.
Yeah, we're just a regular Brady Bunch.
You know, we used to be a family, crazy, dysfunctional, worked 23-hour days -- me, you, Harrison, Abby, Huck.
We had that.
But you can't stand here in this moment, look me in the eye, and say that's what you see.
When was the last time you asked Huck about Kim and Javi?
Do you think it's cool that not too long ago,
Huck begged me to put a gun to his head and blow his brains out?
I think you know the answer to that.
I really don't.
Family doesn't abandon one another.
You abandoned us for him, for the White House.
And since you've been back, your head is nowhere in the game.
You spend more of your time spying on your other ex-boyfriend.
You have a job.
You wanted more responsibility.
You have it.
I take care of you.
I never claimed to be a babysitter.
When I started, after Harrison asked me if I wanted to be a gladiator in a suit,
I got to watch a woman I was in awe of...
[ Scoffs ] ...a woman so fierce, she could breathe fire and would turn whatever was in front of her to dust.
Get the keys, Marcus.
We're leaving.
And still she'd find time to do something thoughtful, like buy an engagement ring for a coworker because she knew he'd never do it on his own.
That's family!
The keys, Marcus!
The keys!
Why do you hate us?
Answer the question, Liv!
What did we do to deserve this treatment?
I'm talking to you, Liv!
Liv!
I was kidnapped!
Do you know what that means?
They took everything from me, everything, my freedom, my dignity!
And I could have just quit.
I could have laid down and died, but I didn't.
I took my life back!
I stood up!
And a year after being sold on the auction block,
I was sitting in the Oval with the president of the United States, and I was running the country!
I'm selfish because I can be.
I'm selfish because, for a week of my life,
I lost that right, and I never, ever, ever want to feel that way again.
Guys.
I don't owe anyone anything!
It's my turn!
-Guys.
-Mine!
Guys!
It wasn't him.
[ Camera shutter clicking ]
Abby.
I have the new draft of your WTO statement.
Thanks.
I'll give it a read later.
Anything else?
Yes.
Advance BLS numbers for the month and a report from the Corps of Engineers on the Mississippi flood.
Does Cyrus have these?
No.
Let's get him copies.
No.
What?
He's working for Frankie Vargas.
What are you talking about?
Cyrus is working for Frankie Vargas.
He's running Vargas' presidential campaign.
You know this?
I know this, Mr. President.
You can ask me how, and I will lay it out for you, but trust me -- I know this.
Thank you, Abby.
That's it?
Thank you, Abby.
What are you going to do?
I don't know.
Your republican White House chief of staff is working for the democratic governor of Pennsylvania.
No, not working for -- kingmaking.
He's kingmaking Vargas, creating a president for the other side, from right here inside the White House, right down the hall, outside this oval, your oval.
He's a turncoat.
You don't let that stand.
That is not how it is done.
And how is it done, Abby?
I announce to the nation that I'm dismissing my most trusted political advisor because he's actually working for Frankie Vargas?
How's that gonna look?
And in the middle of all this,
I'm trying to help Susan become president, but that suddenly seems pointless because I'm gonna spend the critical months of the campaign explaining away this mess and looking for a new chief of staff.
Cyrus has me.
Cyrus wins again.
You think this is easy?
This is not easy.
Mr. President, Cyrus doesn't have you.
He needs you.
You've got what he wants -- a graceful exit.
If you expose him as a turncoat, yeah, it'll be messy for you, but it will destroy him.
He loses his job here, but better -- He can't work for Vargas.
A man with Vargas's reputation for integrity can't be associated with that kind of low treachery.
However, if you allow Cyrus to depart amicably, if you accept his resignation, he's safe.
He can decide to work for Vargas after leaving the White House.
You neutralize him, you keep the optics in your favor.
You win.
And you don't have to spend a single second looking for a new chief of staff.
I'm right here, I'm exceedingly qualified,
I will raise my sword, run at the enemy, and fight the good fight every single day.
I will be the best West Wing general you've ever wished for and the scariest monster you never knew you needed.
I'm loyal, I'm tough, and I'm not afraid to tell you when you're wrong, and you are wrong right now.
because it is easy, Mr. President.
Fire him.
Hire me.
Let me know when it's done.
Yes, Mr. President.
When what is done?
When you fire him.
You want me to fire Cyrus?
You want the job?
That's the job.
I'll let you know when it's done, sir.
He's gonna wake up with his hands on the steering wheel thinking that he fell asleep at the wheel.
He won't remember a thing.
I thought he was Six-Toes.
You what?
I thought he was this guy who wanted revenge for what I did to him a long time ago.
But he's just Sean.
He loves Javi and Kim.
They've been dating for a while.
He has a -- a ring in his pocket that he's planning to give to her.
It's -
- It's nice.
Sean is good for her.
I needed to come down here and be the hero, save Javi and Kim.
But he's not Six-Toes.
He's just Sean.
It's time for me to let go of them, let go of my family.
Huck.
No.
It is.
I have to let them go.
Sean's a good guy.
It's time to move on.
It's time.
I would like to officially announce that I am throwing my hat in the ring and running for president of the greatest country on God's green earth, the United States of America!
[ Cheers and applause ]
You know -- You know why I'm announcing at my old elementary school?
Hell no.
Because you want to end racism?
You want to end poverty?
Then this is the place to start, so we all can embrace America's tomorrow!
He stole my platform, my slogan, my tag line, word for freaking word!
These kids are gonna have to work hard.
No shortcuts.
And if you're some pesky little border-crosser... sad, little refugee begging for a handout... you will not be welcome!
No, sir!
This is America's tomorrow, not yours!
You slimy, slithering, hell-raised son of a whore.
Thank y'all for coming!
Thank y'all for coming!
God bless y'all, and God bless the United States of America!
Hollis Doyle running for President!
This ought to be fun!
For you, maybe, but not for me.
I'm the candidate.
I'm the one that's gonna have to go out and debate that man.
Hollis is a joke.
No one will take him seriously.
I assure you he's not gonna be a problem.
Oh, he wouldn't have been if you hadn't felt the need to start -- and excuse my French -- a pissing match with him over EPA regulations, an issue that I actually agree with Hollis Doyle on,
I might add!
Susan.
He could have been kept on a leash.
Instead, he's gonna make a circus of this campaign and upend our entire Mellie-focused strategy, a strategy that we worked on very hard, a winning strategy!
You do not yell at me in this office.
Where do I yell at you?
I want to go there.
Take me to the place where I yell at you because I am not done!
-Why don't we --
-Get out!
[ Door closes ]
I respect you.
I respect your authority in here.
But outside the gates, I'm the candidate.
This is The Susan Ross Show, sir.
[ Camera shutter clicking ]
[ Sighs ]
It's because of you.
What?
The reason I can be selfish, the reason I can turn my back.
You held things together when I went to the island with Jake.
You ran this place when I left for the White House, and I didn't think twice about leaving you alone because I know, no matter where I am or what I'm doing, you'll jump in.
You'll do whatever you have to.
You'll take care of everyone.
You'll handle the situation.
[ Sighs ]
Island?
After Liv found out her mom was a terrorist and her dad killed the president's son, she went to a secluded island with Jake.
Is there anything else you want to know?
Quinn, have you ever killed anyone?
I think that's enough sharing for today.
Another runaway success at the morning briefing, Red.
You made America care about the WTO.
What?
I need your badge.
You told him?
And I suggest you start collecting all of your personal effects, transfer any relevant contacts to your personal cell because White House security will be here in 15 minutes to sweep your room, wipe your computer, collect your phone and tablet.
I can't believe you told him.
They wanted to come now, but I bought you 15 minutes.
How kind.

Can you say that again, a little louder this time?

I'm just saying, it's not every day that -- I miss you.
That's why I've been acting like this, with the cameras and the stalking and the...

That is there because this klutz crashed into me when I was standing in line at the Shake Shack.
It seems random, casual.
He flirts a little and then, what a surprise, you run into him again.
I could not believe it when I saw him a few days later at that café in Georgetown.
I didn't let him get away that time.

Dad, what do you think?
[ Chuckles ]
I think I've never heard you describe a dessert before.
[ Camera shutter clicking ]
Have you chosen a venue yet?
Jake wants to get married at my parents' place on the Vineyard, even though it is the site of a famous shipwreck.
Ah, she's insanely superstitious.
Do you see this crack on my screen?
Yes.
That is there because this klutz crashed into me when I was standing in line at the Shake Shack.

Jake wants me to toss it, but because it's how we met,

Ah, superstitious and sentimental.

Everything okay?
Uh, work emergency.
I have to go.
You have it?
Is the feed up?
Yeah.
They've just entered the building.
I see you, Vanessa Moss.
Hide your wallet, update your spam filter, and unplug your phone, for that stampede you hear thundering over the hill is the voracious and unyielding herd of candidates and their fundraisers, all just looking to pick your pockets clean
of every hard-earned dollar you got.
The most offensive of this year's crop of snake-oil salesman -- Governor Francisco Vargas, the two-faced democrat who had the nerve to come before you, lovers of liberty, on this very stage and swear to yours truly
not to enter the presidential race.
Governor Vargas?
No chance in hell.
I don't know.
It's not impossible.
Damn near.
They said the same thing about Grant when he first ran, and Vargas is polling better with women than Grant was at this stage.
You're thinking about working for Vargas.
You're jumping ship.
No.
I could never leave Cyrus.
It's okay to be looking out for yourself.
You're gonna be out of a job in a year.
I mean, if Cyrus were to run Vargas' campaign, then I'd jump ship.
Cyrus running Vargas?
Who put that idea in your head?
I'm leaving now.
Okay.
I have five minutes.
-I've got four.
-Where's the coffee?
You were supposed to bring the coffee.
I don't do that anymore.
-What do you mean, "anymore"?
-I'm running OPA.
I don't have time to bring the coffee anymore.
You think the press secretary has time to bring the coffee?
-What do you need?
-A favor.
I need you to look into Cyrus for me.
I need to know what he's been up to, where he's been going, who's he's been calling.
-I can't.
-Why not?
Because, as I said, I'm running OPA.
Yeah.
Does Olivia know you're saying that?
Of course not.
Olivia's been holed up in her apartment watching a video feed of Jake and his new girlfriend.
She has no idea what anyone's been saying or doing.
She's not stalking.
She's focusing on something she thinks is important.
On something that's not her real, actual job.
Keep pretend-running OPA, Quinn.
I'll find someone else to help me.
Next time don't forget the coffee.
Yeppers.
Yes!
[ Chuckles ]
If Javi makes this...
I know.
They go to finals.
Stop putting added pressure on him.
[ Keys clacking ]
-Yes!

-Yes!
-[ Grunts ]
Who's that?
That your ex?
Yeah.
That's Kim.
Is that Kim's boyfriend?
Maybe.
Maybe?
Did you know about him?
Yeah, of course.
It's just the first time I've seen the guy.
[ Cellphone chimes ]
Mellie.
What would you think about changing our environmental platform?
Please tell me you're not taking that meeting.
I'm not.
Mellie, I told you not to meet with him.
I know you think he's the devil and all, but --
I don't think he's the devil.
I know he's the devil, as do you.
Maybe, he's changed.
Well, screw me sideways.
[ Laughing ] Hollis.
Don't promise him anything.
I have to go.
[ Chuckles ] It is so good to see you again.
Likewise!
[ Laughs ]
[ Keys clacking ]
Remember this guy we tried to kill?
I think he's back and after my family.
Nope.
Not ringing any bells.
Look again.
I know we worked on him.
Well, it was a short-ass list, the ones that got away.
Let's see.
Well, he's got both his arms, so cross off the Chechen.
You know who it could be?
It could Six-Toes.
Six-Toes.
I forgot about Six-Toes.
Cried like a baby.
"I'm not gonna be able to walk anymore."
Please.
Hens can walk with three toes.
Anyway, that would be my guess.
Hard to tell with those boots he's wearing.
I'll check around, see if he's resurfaced, in which case you should get to him first because if he finds you, he's not gonna get even by just snipping off a few of yours toes.
Divorce suits a woman well.
I can see it in your hips there.
You're leaner and meaner. the men will come running, I promise you that.
[ Both laugh ]
That's very kind of you.
[ Laughs ]
[ Clears throat ] So, here's the thing.
I got money... republican money, the kind of money that wins elections.
And just like it is with dating, I want to spend it on the gal who I think's gonna put out for me.
You gonna put out for me, Mellie Grant, or are we just gonna rub jeans together and leave here frustrated?
[ Laughs ]
[ Sighs ]
Well, look, I know you've been lobbying for cutbacks at the EPA.
And while I probably shouldn't be offering you this --
[ Laughs ] "Cutbacks"?
Sweetheart, I'm looking to raze that building to the ground.
I'm an oil man, darling.
You promise me you'll consider pulling the plug on that there travesty,
I'll write a check right now for half a billion dollars.
You know I can't promise you that.
Well, I guess I'll have to go talk to that other little cupcake, see how far up her skirt she's willing to let me go.
Look --
[ Camera shutter clicking ]
No.
The man's being courted as we speak.
The man's a disease.
I'm not letting him infect Susan.
Sir, I understand the two of you have a history, but we need him on our side.
So he can pander to his special interests?
This is our chance to cut Mellie off at the knees.
Her campaign's financial picture is just plain sad.
She needs Hollis Doyle's money more than anyone, which is exactly why we need to keep her from getting it.
It can't hurt to cripple the competition.
Abby:
Unless it backfires.
It's Hollis Doyle.
It comes with strings attached.
Worth the risk, if you ask me.
Set up a meeting.
[ Sighs ]
-You were right.
-What?
Cyrus Beene is cheating on the President.
I don't mean literally.
Well, of course you don't mean literally.
That wouldn't make any sense.
Anyway, Cyrus and Frankie Vargas have been in contact a lot -- phone calls, dinner.
Well, after the shooting, Vargas came to the White House, so a certain amount of --
27 phone calls mobile to mobile.
And Cyrus was in Harrisburg two weeks ago.
Harrisburg?
It seems like Cyrus is in bed with two different men.
What the hell does that mean?
I'm in bed with two different women -- literally.
And we're done here.
Do you know what it took for me to get that information?
I need your help, Abby.
[ Sighs ]
Who are they?
One is horrible, wicked, cruel, possibly an actual witch.
The other is a wonderful person.
This sounds like a real dilemma.
Okay, yes, but one, you know, satisfies me.
You need help.
[ Camera shutter clicking ]
Bad news -- Hollis is meeting with Susan.
Liv?
That's fine.
He'll be her problem now.
But it's so much money.
There's always more money.
Where?
Kickstarter?
Well-meaning relatives?
Is this when the money's finally gonna start rolling in, Liv?
No need to panic, Mellie.
It's early days.
A presidential campaign is a marathon.
Maybe if you sat down with Hollis.
No.
Thanks for nothing.

[ Knock on door ]
Show's over.
This is pathetic, low.
No, it's just sad.
You have some truly detestable qualities about you, but I never thought jealousy was one of them.
I'm not jealous.
Then explain this to me, all of this, why you're holed up like a conspiracy kook spying on the head of the NSA.
I want to know why you chose her, how she fits into whatever you and my father are planning.
Man, he really messed you up.
The way my father raised me has allowed me --
Not your father -
- Fitz.
You walked away from him over and over, time after time, because you knew in your gut, you knew if you said yes, he'd own you, he'd consume you, he'd be no different than your father,
but over time, Fitz manipulated you.
He made you feel like -- like you owed him.
It's what he does best.
You knew that more than anyone, and you still fell for it.
Man, that has got to turn your world upside down, to go from being the smartest person in the room to the biggest fool... to realize you're just another textbook example of daddy issues, played out on a national stage.
But I am in love, Olivia.
I am marrying a woman I love.
She's smart, she's beautiful, and best of all, she's capable of loving me back.
Your girlfriends aren't girlfriends.
They're marks.
Nothing you do is real.
I must be plotting something because Vanessa likes Hugh Grant movies, she reads Vogue and takes multivitamins.
But, Liv, that is precisely what I want.
[ Sighs ]
Yeah, one more thing before I go --
Did you enjoy it, hmm?
Watching us?
Did you pretend that you were her?
Did you get off when she got off?
[ Door closes ]
Oh, you're here.
Why would I not be here?
This is my office, Red.
I thought you'd be in the meeting on Hollis Doyle.
I thought you'd be in the meeting on Hollis Doyle.
Nope.
I'm on something else -- Frankie Vargas.
Vargas?
Right -
- The Harrisburg Hero, The Capitol Tackle.
I thought his 15 minutes were up.
He announced he's running for president today, didn't he?
He did.
[ Chuckles ] Good luck to him on that.
Should we release a statement?
-On Vargas?
-On Vargas.
I don't think that's necessary, Red.
We're out of the election game.
Are you?
What?
Out of the election game.
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about you working with Frankie Vargas.
You've been talking to him on the phone.
He's the governor of a major state.
What other governor have you spoken with 27 times on your mobile phone in the last two weeks?
What other governor became a national hero by tackling a madman?
And how do you know who I've been talking to?
You've been to Harrisburg recently.
My niece lives in Harrisburg.
You're lying.
How dare you?
!
Do you realize how outrageous this is, coming in here and accusing me of lying, of working with Frankie Vargas to run for President?
He's a democrat.
He wants free college.
You've lost your mind, Red, and I will have your job.
You've insulted me.
You've violated me, tracking my calls, my travel.
You messed up!
I talked with him on the phone about coming to the White House.
I tried to align our education platforms.
I met him for dinner once.
That's it.
I've never seen the man other than that.
You're lying.
I'm telling the president.
[ Scoffs ]
He wanted some advice, okay?
I gave him some advice.
I tried to offer him some help.
That was it.
It was a few conversations.
-You're lying.
-Damn it!
No.
Yes.
Okay.
He -
- He wanted more.
He wanted me to run his campaign.
He asked me to run his campaign.
I didn't go to him.
Heaskedme .
And it never went any further than that, I promise you.
I never violated my oath to the president.
-You're lying.
-No, no.
Please.
Please.
Abby.
Abby!
I'm sorry!
I've made a terrible mistake here.
You're right.
You're right.
But I will make it right.
I promise you, Abby.
Look at me.
Look at me.
It's over.
It is over, okay?
Please do not tell the president.
Everything we've been through.
Do not give up on me.
I beg you.
This job is everything to me.
I lost it once.
I can't lose it again.
Please.
Okay.
[ Camera shutter clicking ]
Hey, Robin.
What are you doing here?
Looking for Huck.
He around?
[ Sighs ] Do you see anyone around, anyone except me?
Liv's not around.
Huck's not around.
It's just me who's around, Charlie.
Geez.
What's with the 'tude?
Uh, Huck was here for a minute, and then he took off.
What do you need?
He wanted me to look into this dude.
He had some theory that he was a fellow we tortured back in the day.
Don't know what his name was on the way in.
It was Six-Toes on the way out.
[ Clicks tongue ]
Intel came back saying he's a car salesman in Frederick, but that could just be his cover.
Who's he?
-Lover.
-No one.
Look, have you talked to Huck?
Where'd you get this?
Why?
Huck saw this guy hanging out with his son and ex-wife.
I could tell he was upset.
Uh, am I missing something here?
What's the problem?
Dead battery?
Not sure exactly.
Some light came on, and then the car just died.
These cars nowadays can drive themselves, but they can't seem to fix themselves.
[ Chuckles ]
You know anything about computers?
Yee.
Not really.
I'm old school.
Yeah.
Me too.
Next time, I'm going full diesel.
[ Chuckles ]
Yeah, my -- my phone's missing, too.
I must have left it someplace.
I can bring you to a gas station if you want.
Thanks, man.
My name's Sean.
Hey.
Harold.
All right.
Mr. President!
Hollis.
Thanks for coming.
Oh, it's not every day
I get invited to the big house, now, is it?
At least, not anymore.
Ohh!
[ Sighs ]
Susan, Hollis was just in your home state last week.
Oversaw a completion of 17 new rigs we got out there.
Isn't Virginia just lovely?
Mm.
It'd be a little lovelier if the EPA wasn't crawling up my tooter every damn minute with their so-called regulations.
You might not know this about me, Hollis, but my father was a coal miner, as was his father and his and, oh, his father, too.
How 'bout that.
Love me a country girl.
Country girl wants something, she goes for it, works hard for it, not like those out-of-touch, rich folks born with silver spoon in their mouth, never worked for nothing in their lives.
Right, Fitz?
Oh, come on, now.
I'm talking 'bout myself, Mr. President.
Anyway, I am all for the environment, but I'm also for the economy, too, you know?
I do know, Suzy.
Offshore oil drilling, natural gas development off the Atlantic -- it comes with nearly 300,000 jobs and up to $24 billion to our nation's economy alone.
Don't forget about $51 billion in government revenue.
Provided there are no accidents.
Mr. President.
Deepwater Horizon, ExxonValdez.
Tell me what those did for our economy again?
Let's not get be distracted by a few minor --
You don't have to do this, Susan.
You don't have to say the things you think he wants to hear, the things I know you don't honestly believe.
-Now, wait a minute.
-What do you want, Hollis?
Let's just cut the chitchat and get right to the point.
I think we might be getting ahead of ourselves.
Because we don't need you or your money to win an election.
I know I didn't.
You must be talking about your second term, right?
'Cause I'm sure you remember how you won your first.
You know what?
We're done here.
[ Camera shutter clicking ]
Your ex-husband was downright rude to me.
Hm.
San Antonio rude!
So I'm gonna give you another chance to bend my ear.
How's that sound?
Sounds great.
Now, let's dig into the issue of them freeloading illegals.
I can't even...
Cyrus is working for a democrat?
Cyrus Beene?
He says it's over, that he was just considering the job with Vargas, not working for him.
And you believe him?
Well, I want to believe him, but come on.
It's Cyrus.
If he's breathing, he's lying.
The thing is...
I have him, Liv.
Oh.
So, that's a good thing to you now?
I can see it.
It's right there in front of me, like this shining path.
I know exactly what to do, what steps to take, how to make it happen, like -- like I was built for it.
I have him.
I have Cyrus.
I just know --
How to take that information and use it against him, bury him.
Crush him, destroy him, slit his throat and bathe in his blood.
You want his job.
You want to be the White House chief of staff.
Hell yeah.
I want to run that mother.
And you don't think you should wait your turn?
Cyrus has been a great friend to me.
He's also one of the worst human beings on the planet.
That doesn't answer my question.
It does.
A good person would wait their turn.
But a Cyrus wouldn't.
A true monster would never wait.
A monster cuts in line.
A monster takes.
And you and I both know that this town is run by monsters.
They have the power.
The biggest dogs with the sharpest teeth own the room.
So, how long should I wait?
How long do you think it'll be before a big dog will rip my throat out and take my spot in line?
But how do the big dogs sleep at night?
I mean, what if I do this and I can't sleep at night?
Abby...
[ Chuckles ]
You're a good person.
You're just standing too close to the Oval.
You can feel the power, and you want it.
Everyone does.
But don't --
Don't let that place corrupt you.
Once you drive that stake through Cyrus's heart, there will be no turning back.
Once you take the white hat off, it's gone.
You will no longer be you.
And the thing is, being a big dog isn't as great as it seems.
Be a better person.
Okay?
[ Cellphone chimes ]
What?
Any idea where he went?
I'm tracking his GPS.
Hopefully we get to him before he gets to Sean Barton.
-Sean Barton?
-Kim's new boyfriend.
He sells cars in Frederick, home-brews as a hobby.
Huck saw him with Kim and Javi.
I knew he was upset.
I didn't think he was that upset.
You should have told me he was spying on his family.
He was watching his kid play a soccer game.
I didn't think it was a big deal.
I also didn't know he was a government-trained assassin.
[ Alarm chirps ]
Well, I really appreciate you helping me out, Harold.
I'm supposed to meet my girlfriend and her son.
Yeah, no problem.
You two, um...
You two been dating long?
Only a few months.
She's great.
And her son's the best.
You got kids?
Not anymore.
Oh.
I...
Wow.
I'm so sorry, Harold.
Sometimes things just happen.
Hey, man, I think you just passed the gas station.
Harold?
The name's not Harold.
And yours isn't Sean.
So, you're saying we should actually embrace those that want to tear this country down?
I'm saying if we keep telling certain people they don't belong here, then how can we expect them to not hate us?
I mean, didn't we learn that in preschool, to treat others like we want to be treated?
That's why early education is so important, by the way.
That's why I want to not only support, but expand pre-K programs.
You think the voters are gonna go for that?
I'm making it the bedrock of my campaign.
"Embrace America's Tomorrow."
I'm even announcing my candidacy in my old elementary school.
[ Chuckles ]
So they better.
[ Chuckles ]
[ Chuckles ]
I'll have my people call yours in the morning.
Let's embrace America's tomorrow together.
[ Chuckles ]
[ Laughs ]
What now?
I don't know.
We are definitely too late.
This guy...
Sean.
...is bleeding out on some tarp right now while Huck eats a turkey sandwich and hums Army tunes.
I cannot believe you didn't tell me what he was up to.
I didn't know he ate people for a living 'cause, per usual,
I'm the last one to know anything, despite the fact I've done nothing but prove myself a valuable member of this team.
He's right.
He's right?
You need to start treating him like part of the family because he is.
You're serious.
You -
- You actually said that with a straight face?
Family?
What family, huh?
I see three strangers standing on the side of the road, fingers crossed, hoping their coworker didn't murder someone.
Yeah, we're just a regular Brady Bunch.
You know, we used to be a family, crazy, dysfunctional, worked 23-hour days -- me, you, Harrison, Abby, Huck.
We had that.
But you can't stand here in this moment, look me in the eye, and say that's what you see.
When was the last time you asked Huck about Kim and Javi?
Do you think it's cool that not too long ago,
Huck begged me to put a gun to his head and blow his brains out?
I think you know the answer to that.
I really don't.
Family doesn't abandon one another.
You abandoned us for him, for the White House.
And since you've been back, your head is nowhere in the game.
You spend more of your time spying on your other ex-boyfriend.
You have a job.
You wanted more responsibility.
You have it.
I take care of you.
I never claimed to be a babysitter.
When I started, after Harrison asked me if I wanted to be a gladiator in a suit,
I got to watch a woman I was in awe of...
[ Scoffs ] ...a woman so fierce, she could breathe fire and would turn whatever was in front of her to dust.
Get the keys, Marcus.
We're leaving.
And still she'd find time to do something thoughtful, like buy an engagement ring for a coworker because she knew he'd never do it on his own.
That's family!
The keys, Marcus!
The keys!
Why do you hate us?
Answer the question, Liv!
What did we do to deserve this treatment?
I'm talking to you, Liv!
Liv!
I was kidnapped!
Do you know what that means?
They took everything from me, everything, my freedom, my dignity!
And I could have just quit.
I could have laid down and died, but I didn't.
I took my life back!
I stood up!
And a year after being sold on the auction block,
I was sitting in the Oval with the president of the United States, and I was running the country!
I'm selfish because I can be.
I'm selfish because, for a week of my life,
I lost that right, and I never, ever, ever want to feel that way again.
Guys.
I don't owe anyone anything!
It's my turn!
-Guys.
-Mine!
Guys!
It wasn't him.
[ Camera shutter clicking ]
Abby.
I have the new draft of your WTO statement.
Thanks.
I'll give it a read later.
Anything else?
Yes.
Advance BLS numbers for the month and a report from the Corps of Engineers on the Mississippi flood.
Does Cyrus have these?
No.
Let's get him copies.
No.
What?
He's working for Frankie Vargas.
What are you talking about?
Cyrus is working for Frankie Vargas.
He's running Vargas' presidential campaign.
You know this?
I know this, Mr. President.
You can ask me how, and I will lay it out for you, but trust me -- I know this.
Thank you, Abby.
That's it?
Thank you, Abby.
What are you going to do?
I don't know.
Your republican White House chief of staff is working for the democratic governor of Pennsylvania.
No, not working for -- kingmaking.
He's kingmaking Vargas, creating a president for the other side, from right here inside the White House, right down the hall, outside this oval, your oval.
He's a turncoat.
You don't let that stand.
That is not how it is done.
And how is it done, Abby?
I announce to the nation that I'm dismissing my most trusted political advisor because he's actually working for Frankie Vargas?
How's that gonna look?
And in the middle of all this,
I'm trying to help Susan become president, but that suddenly seems pointless because I'm gonna spend the critical months of the campaign explaining away this mess and looking for a new chief of staff.
Cyrus has me.
Cyrus wins again.
You think this is easy?
This is not easy.
Mr. President, Cyrus doesn't have you.
He needs you.
You've got what he wants -- a graceful exit.
If you expose him as a turncoat, yeah, it'll be messy for you, but it will destroy him.
He loses his job here, but better -- He can't work for Vargas.
A man with Vargas's reputation for integrity can't be associated with that kind of low treachery.
However, if you allow Cyrus to depart amicably, if you accept his resignation, he's safe.
He can decide to work for Vargas after leaving the White House.
You neutralize him, you keep the optics in your favor.
You win.
And you don't have to spend a single second looking for a new chief of staff.
I'm right here, I'm exceedingly qualified,
I will raise my sword, run at the enemy, and fight the good fight every single day.
I will be the best West Wing general you've ever wished for and the scariest monster you never knew you needed.
I'm loyal, I'm tough, and I'm not afraid to tell you when you're wrong, and you are wrong right now.
because it is easy, Mr. President.
Fire him.
Hire me.
Let me know when it's done.
Yes, Mr. President.
When what is done?
When you fire him.
You want me to fire Cyrus?
You want the job?
That's the job.
I'll let you know when it's done, sir.
He's gonna wake up with his hands on the steering wheel thinking that he fell asleep at the wheel.
He won't remember a thing.
I thought he was Six-Toes.
You what?
I thought he was this guy who wanted revenge for what I did to him a long time ago.
But he's just Sean.
He loves Javi and Kim.
They've been dating for a while.
He has a -- a ring in his pocket that he's planning to give to her.
It's -
- It's nice.
Sean is good for her.
I needed to come down here and be the hero, save Javi and Kim.
But he's not Six-Toes.
He's just Sean.
It's time for me to let go of them, let go of my family.
Huck.
No.
It is.
I have to let them go.
Sean's a good guy.
It's time to move on.
It's time.
I would like to officially announce that I am throwing my hat in the ring and running for president of the greatest country on God's green earth, the United States of America!
[ Cheers and applause ]
You know -- You know why I'm announcing at my old elementary school?
Hell no.
Because you want to end racism?
You want to end poverty?
Then this is the place to start, so we all can embrace America's tomorrow!
He stole my platform, my slogan, my tag line, word for freaking word!
These kids are gonna have to work hard.
No shortcuts.
And if you're some pesky little border-crosser... sad, little refugee begging for a handout... you will not be welcome!
No, sir!
This is America's tomorrow, not yours!
You slimy, slithering, hell-raised son of a whore.
Thank y'all for coming!
Thank y'all for coming!
God bless y'all, and God bless the United States of America!
Hollis Doyle running for President!
This ought to be fun!
For you, maybe, but not for me.
I'm the candidate.
I'm the one that's gonna have to go out and debate that man.
Hollis is a joke.
No one will take him seriously.
I assure you he's not gonna be a problem.
Oh, he wouldn't have been if you hadn't felt the need to start -- and excuse my French -- a pissing match with him over EPA regulations, an issue that I actually agree with Hollis Doyle on,
I might add!
Susan.
He could have been kept on a leash.
Instead, he's gonna make a circus of this campaign and upend our entire Mellie-focused strategy, a strategy that we worked on very hard, a winning strategy!
You do not yell at me in this office.
Where do I yell at you?
I want to go there.
Take me to the place where I yell at you because I am not done!
-Why don't we --
-Get out!
[ Door closes ]
I respect you.
I respect your authority in here.
But outside the gates, I'm the candidate.
This is The Susan Ross Show, sir.
[ Camera shutter clicking ]
[ Sighs ]
It's because of you.
What?
The reason I can be selfish, the reason I can turn my back.
You held things together when I went to the island with Jake.
You ran this place when I left for the White House, and I didn't think twice about leaving you alone because I know, no matter where I am or what I'm doing, you'll jump in.
You'll do whatever you have to.
You'll take care of everyone.
You'll handle the situation.
_
Ahh!
Aah!
Aah!
_
Huh.
Uh.
She won't care.
Oh.
Are you kidding me?
I wish I was dead.
Oh.
Hello.
Is this the, um, Miller residence?
Ah.
You're just in time.
I'm leaving.
What are you, a Jehovah's Witness?
Well, God's dead, so hit the bricks.
Uh, I'd like to speak to Mrs. Miller.
She's in heaven.
How can you believe in heaven and not in God?
I believe in McDonald's, but I know damn sure Ronald ain't for real.
But if Mrs. Miller passed away... what's fighting the demons of Willard's Mill?
Oh, get in the God damn car.
No, sweetie.
Because you won't have midriff until you're 21.
That's why you can't wear it.
Okay.
Love you, too.
Bye.
Go, uh...
Go ahead.
Tell her what you told me.
My name's Andrew Barton.
I'm from Putney, Vermont.
Huh!
Figures.
I'm researching for a book on the history of Willard's Mill.
I know about the witch burnings and Constable Eccles and the curse on the sheriffs of this town.
See?
Cuckoo bananas.
Nerd.
You know, "Nerd" isn't really the insult it used to be.
Uh, yeah, right.
Look, there's just too little carnage in this town for so much demonic infestation.
Someone's been fighting the demons of Willard's Mill, and I think that person is your wife...
Claire Miller.
Evie, watch this...
You, sir, are a nerd.
The guy's bulletproof.
What he's saying is that you seem like a very nice man, you know, but I think maybe you spent a little too much time on the old Internet.
I search purchases for books on the occult...
Sumerian artifacts, weaponry.
Who in a town like this would want to amass such an armory?
Apparently, someone named Claire Miller.
Well...
Claire Miller is no longer with us.
So...
Then who?
My puzzle!
Hello?
You what?
Your... your puzzle.
No, I-I didn't...
Oh.
- Sweetheart, calm down.
I, uh...
- Stan's daughter.
Oh.
Stan has a daughter?
You know, actually... calm down.
I...
I'm pretty sure I know what happened.
W-When I left the house,
I spotted an owl who was flying around, and he's the one who probably tore your puzzle apart.
You know how owls just...
They can't abide puzzles, sweetheart.
They...
They hate 'em...
it pushes all their buttons.
It's all over the nature channels.
I tell you what you do, if this would be any relief, Google "owl puzzles."
Yeah.
That'll do the trick.
Go get 'em.
Okay.
Bye.
No!
No!
No, no, no!
No!
No!
It's so kind of you to take me in like this.
I really would have been fine in the hospital.
That's what I said.
Thank her.
Oh, no.
I wasn't gonna let you stay in that gross, old hospital.
I found you, which makes you my responsibility.
Hey.
Sorry to just barge in like this.
Are you really?
Meh.
Andrew, I need to ask you a few more questions about that thing you say attacked you.
"Thing"?
I never said a "thing" attacked me.
I said a demon attacked me.
Why are you still acting like this is a secret?
I know what's going on.
Oh, we can make a dump cake.
Okay, Andrew...
I thought Denise took over for Claire when she died... but no way.
That leaves the two of you.
I think it's time we all came clean, yeah?
Mr. Miller... your wife assembled an armory of weapons information.
Show me where it is.
Stan?
Evie, the guy looks like popcorn and he smells like cod, and now he won't clam.
Give me a break.
I swear to God...
There you go.
Oh, my God.
There!
That's it.
That's the thing that attacked me!
But how do we kill it?
How do we read this stuff?
Let me see tha...
Uh, uh, uh...
This is my wife's.
Oh, sorry.

Huh.
It says... you kill it by cutting its head off with... with that thing.
This one?
Gee, who'd have thought cuttin' its head off would kill it?
Well, it looks like you guys got this under control.
I'm out of here.
What?
No.
You have to come.
No, I don't.
It's all good.
Now, Stan, are you sure...
Bye.
Okay.
What are you doing?
Turning this cake into a puzzle that's made of cake...
That's a puzzle that's made of cake.
Sweetheart, come with me, will ya?
I, uh...
I need your help.
Can I bring my cake?
Absolutely.
Come on.
Yes!
Well, I had kind of a bad experience here the last time.
Is this where you were married?
Very funny.
Great.
On this spot in 1919,
Father Charles Milton was killed.
Milton knew about Eccles and his plan... to found a colony of witches and turn Willard's Mill into a portal from the Land of Shadows to the Land of Light.
Milton tried to stop it but didn't get very far.
If you read the reports of his death, it's obvious he was killed by the very demon we're seeking to destroy.
Yeah.
Okay.
And what makes you so sure it's down here?
Trust me.
Oh, shit.
Aah!
"Come into my parlor," said the spider to fly.
"Tis the prettiest little parlor that you ever did spy."
God, really?
!
Evie...
We're going away now.
I mean, it took you long enough to figure it out.
Guess who attacked me, Evie?
I did.
I bit the shit out of myself.
It really hurt.
And just like that, you gave me access to a room that holds more power than your mortal brain could ever comprehend.
Aah!
And what I will do with that knowledge...
That you should live to see.
Get away from me!
Well, then again...
Ugh.
We don't got a lot of time.
Pick it up, sister.
All right, you're all set.
- You understand the plan?
- Yeah, I got the plan.
Okay.
Is there more to the plan, or do I just sit here?
I'm gonna go ahead go and write it down for you.
Okay.
Mr. Miller?
What?
No!
No!
I had a feeling you'd show up.
Where is it, Stan?
I want the weapons!
I want the books!
I want that stone!
I'm gonna go easy on ya...
'Cause you're just a little guy.
Whoa.
Wow.
What just happened?
I...
I was about to kick your ass!
Where are we?
Huh?
This heaven?
Is Claire here?
Oh, shit.
Should've done my laundry.
My shirt smells like low tide at Asshole Beach.
Claire hates Asshole Beach.
Oh.
Evie?
Who are the Greek-chorus assholes?
What, are you, dead, too?
Hey, tough guy.
If this is heaven... where is everybody?
Where's John Wayne?
Where's Frank Sinatra?
Hey, Evie, did you hear that?
We're gonna see Ol' Blue Eyes.
God damn, I hope it's a young Frank.
You're not dead yet.
This is the Land of Shadows, Mr. Miller, where the victims of Constable Eccles are brought until we're sent back to the Land of Light, where our souls and bodies are bound to a demon,
and then we're sent back to the surface to kill, the way I was sent to kill you.
Ha!
How'd that work out for you?
Stan.
Ah, I see your point.
But I've done one better.
I've brought you back alive... the last two sheriffs of Willard's Mill.
And I'm gonna use your lives to buy back my soul.
I should have punched you right in the esophagus when I had a chance.
Hey, he put me in a web... sticky, gross.
Oh, I'd kill a rattlesnake with a rock, but no way José on the spiders.
Leave a message.
Hey, Dad.
I know you said,
"Go to the storage space and then come straight home.
But then I thought, "What if I got a tattoo?"
Great idea, right?
I mean, I'm the only person who doesn't have a tattoo, so then I thought Wh...
Damn it.

Hey, Dad.

So, I know you said...

Who?
Constable Eccles...
And I'll walk in the light once more.
Hey.
Where are you assholes going?
And then what, Andrew?
What about them, the other members of The Colony?
Oh, they'll come after me.
That's why the first order of business will be killing your daughter and reclaiming the armory that your wife assembled.
So then once you've returned, you'll start hunting Eccles' demons like we have?
Precisely.
Think of it...
Me, the one mortal with the knowledge to eradicate the vile coven of Eccles and his minions forever.
What do you suppose the good people of Willard's Mill will think of me them, hmm?
Say, butch...
You might want to go ahead and ask them yourself.
No!
That...
That just happened, right?
Yeah.

I wrote it down for you, for the love of Christ.
What'd you do?
Where you been?

What...
What's the inside scoop?
Maybe I was busy growing!
Go grow in your room.

♪ Elementary 4x07 ♪ Miss Taken Original Air Date on January 7, 2016
== sync, corrected by elderman == @elder_man
GREGSON:
Believe it or not, this used to be an FBI agent.
Or, at least, that's what the badge says.
Lab is running the DNA to make sure.
Special Agent Robert Underhill, retired.
His car was found about 200 yards from the scene.
GREGSON:
I reached out to the Bureau's New York office;
they're standing by to help, but... since Underhill was officially a civilian, it's our case.
No Joan today?
She's going to join us later.
So what else do we know about Special Agent Underhill?
An exemplary 34-year career, well-liked by his colleagues.
He and his wife Sheila moved to Kauai, 2012.
They moved back to New York about seven months ago.
Well, assuming this is Special Agent Underhill, he would've been dead before he went into the wood chipper.
The killer would've had to dismember him in order to get him through the infeed chute.
Right, so CSU examined all the chain saws that were used at the site, and found one with some blood between the teeth.
(sniffing)
They think someone used it and then cleaned it last night.
Oleoresin capsicum.
More commonly known as... (sniffs) pepper spray.
We should alert the M.E. that this bag contains at least part of the face.
I'm sure he'll appreciate that.
So the bootprint found next to his car suggests he drove there himself.
Pepper spray, it's a close-range weapon.
Whoever deployed it would have had to have been close to him.
You think he was invited to the scene, knew his attacker.
The agent was a large man-- at least 220 pounds.
So if I was going to turn him into pulp,
I'd want him as close to that wood chipper as possible.
You said his wife's name was Sheila?
Mm.
We should talk to her, see if she knows her way around a chain saw.
What makes you think she did this?
Well, his personal effects are here.
I see the remains of a wallet, watch... there's no wedding ring.
And this bag, amongst the skin and bones, has flecks of latex and foil.
Looks like he was carrying at least one wrapped condom with him.
So he may not have been ready for a fight, but... he was ready for fun.
Bob wasn't cheating on me.
At least, not with another woman.
The only affair he ever had was with his job.
It was our understanding your husband retired in 2012.
He did.
We sold our house and moved to Kauai.
Then he got restless.
Missed his work, missed the city.
I could tell he wasn't happy, so I agreed to move back.
HOLMES:
Respectfully,
Mrs. Underhill, we found evidence that he may have still been restless:
the remains of two unused prophylactics.
We separated six months ago.
It was amicable.
We stayed in touch.
So you separated but didn't divorce.
I'm guessing that means you're still his primary beneficiary.
You'd have been entitled to his pension, his life insurance...
I had dinner at my daughter's house in New Jersey last night.
Drank half a bottle of rosé, spent the night in the guest room.
Can anyone other than your daughter confirm that?
I took a train back to the city this morning.
There should be a record of my ticket purchase and... security footage from stations.
All right, we'll look into it.
In the meantime, can you think of anyone who would've wanted to hurt your husband?
After we moved back to New York,
Bob started looking into some of his old cases.
Ones that he never solved.
He asked a friend at the Bureau for copies of a bunch of files.
The last time we spoke, he said he thought one of those cases was finally going to crack.
He was closing in on someone.
Who?
I don't know.
Out of respect, he kept shop talk to a minimum after we separated.
But I'm sure if you go to his apartment, you'll find all the files.
They may tell you everything you need to know.
(knocking on door)
Joanie.
My gosh.
It's been months.
You look beautiful.
Thanks, Dad.
Or should I call you Grover Ogden?
What were you thinking?
I was honoring you.
The choices you make, the work you do.
I think it's wonderful.
Really?
So that's why you didn't ask my permission.
That's why you used a pseudonym.
Because you knew how honored I would be.
Did you even read the book?
Of course I read the book.
And?
It's ridiculous.
Sherlock and I do not run around with guns and we don't get into kung fu fights with criminals and we sure as hell do not sleep together.
Well, sex sells, Joanie.
You know that.
So how did you know that that was me?
Grover Ogden?
We lived on Ogden Avenue.
Grover was our dog.
And by the way, that is how you make a porn name, not a pen name!
Okay, look, I owed my publishers a book.
I was blocked.
I've never been blocked like this before.
I was going crazy.
So your mother comes home from seeing you in the city, and she tells me about this case you're working on, so...
Did she know about this?
No.
I'm just telling you how it all happened.
I don't care how it happened.
I just want it to go away.
Well, what does that mean?
The Heart Bled Blue didn't get the e-book treatment, which is good, for both of us, because I spent almost $4,000 last night trying to find all the hard copies I could find online.
You're gonna contact your publisher and you're gonna track down the rest.
(chuckling):
You can't be serious.
Did Sherlock read the book?
What does that have to do with anything?
Well, you gave your opinion.
I'd like to know his.
Okay, first, you are not friends.
You met him once, at Aunt Vivian's funeral.
Second, he is never gonna find out about this.
He is the most private person that I know.
He would freak if he found out.
Call your publisher, Dad.
I mean it.
HOLMES:
Typically, I'm averse to color coordination, but I dare say it brightens the place up.
What is all this?
The case files of the late Bob Underhill.
You got my texts?
Murdered FBI agent fed through a wood chipper.
His wife thought it was over one of his unsolved cases.
Marcus and I went to his apartment and discovered he had been revisiting three of them.
I made copies of his files and assigned each case its own room.
As you can see, the library tells the tale of a hate crime, a church burnt to the ground in 1981.
The arsonist, never identified.
You think that's who killed Underhill?
I do not.
Thanks in no small part to the late agent's meticulous notes,
I identified the guilty party.
He died in 1982.
This case took longer to solve, but not much.
Two-man bank robbery from 1997.
As it turns out, both parties went to jail for unrelated crimes in the early aughts.
Both parties remain incarcerated, so they're not our killers either.
Finally, the case of a serial poisoner who took six lives between 2008 and 2012.
I realized that the culprit was, in fact, the brother of one of Underhill's original suspects.
The only problem, he's in the Navy and he was on an aircraft carrier in the Arabian Sea last night.
So you took the three cases this guy couldn't crack over an entire career and you solved them in a few hours.
Bad news is his wife was wrong.
Underhill's old cases had nothing to do with his murder.
Actually, I think one of them did.
I asked the captain to find out if Underhill had requested any other case files, and it turns out he had.
Mina Davenport.
Oh, you're familiar with the case?
Of course.
She was kidnapped in 2004.
The guy who took her kept her in a basement.
Ten years later, she escaped and came home-- it was a huge story.
Are you saying that Underhill worked her abduction in '04?
He did.
And again in 2015.
He asked for and received copies of her case file just a few months ago.
Curious, then, that they were not amongst his many other materials.
Well, Mina's kidnapper was never found.
You think that's who Underhill was closing in on?
I think the absence of the files the agent requested is very suspicious.
Perhaps the killer removed them from his person last night.
Perhaps, post-mulching, he used his keys to access his apartment.
Either way, it could mean that Mina's abductor committed a murder less than 20 miles from her home last night.
WOMAN:
It's hard to explain, losing your only child when she's ten, and then getting her back at 20.
People tend to think about the ten years you lost, but we could only think about the future;
all the time we were gonna have together after all.
It was a gift.
But we knew there was a catch, that the monster who had taken Mina was still out there.
BELL:
Like I said, we can't be sure he's the one who killed Bob Underhill.
We wanted to know if you've seen anything out of the ordinary lately, any strange faces or vehicles?
No.
Nothing.
What about Mina?
If she had, she would've told us.
Is she here?
She's upstairs with her tutor.
She's working on her GED.
I mean, if it's all the same to you,
I'd rather not bring her into this.
If we're right, Mr. Davenport, she may be at the very center of it.
RICHARD:
Well, if you're right.
If you're not, you could just upset her.
You could set her back months.
We've worked so hard to make her feel safe;
to help her find some peace.
After she first got away, she wouldn't let anyone touch her, not for weeks.
Now she'll let me hold her hand again.
She'll...
let me hug her.
What about Bob Underhill?
Had you heard from him lately?
(sighs)
I wish we had.
Uh...
Look, a... a-after this happened,
I-I, um...
I-I could hardly function.
I was the one who was supposed to pick Mina up from school that day;
I-I was the one who let the meeting run long, I...
I mean, it was my fault that she tried to walk home and, um... (sighs) ...when I could do nothing,
Agent Underhill did everything.
He was, uh... he was our rock.
HOLMES:
We knew that Mina was able to help the FBI generate a sketch of her captor.
She even, uh, provided a first name:
Keith.
In the months since her return, has she remembered any other salient details?
Anything that might help us identify him?
I'm sorry.
No.
MINA:
Mom...
Dad...
Is everything okay?
It's all right, sweetie.
We'll be done in here in just a minute.
BELL:
Davenports may not have seen Keith around, but that doesn't mean we can't circulate his sketch.
WATSON:
Even if he didn't kill Underhill, he's still worth finding.
Assuming a figment of someone's imagination can be found.
What is that supposed to mean?
That man did not kill Agent Underhill, nor did he kidnap that young woman.
The description she gave is entirely fictional.
Hold up-- are you calling Mina Davenport a liar?
No, I'm calling that young girl a liar.
She's not Mina Davenport.
She's an imposter.
HOLMES:
The old proverb says the eyes are the window to the soul.
In this case, it's the ears.
Note, in each image, the depth of the triangular fossa and the degree of attachment of the lobule.
These are the ears of two different people.
They don't look that different to me.
Watson?
He's right.
The architecture of the second ear is all wrong.
Mina Davenport disappeared when she was ten years old.
She grew; she changed.
Her body changed.
But not her ears.
They grow as kids get older, but they don't change shape.
Basically, this girl could not have grown up to become this girl.
We no longer think that Agent Underhill was onto Mina Davenport's abductor.
We believe he was onto her imposter.
Because of ears.
Six months ago, the first pictures of Miracle Mina were released by her family to the press.
Two weeks later, Agent Underhill requested copies of any and all files pertaining to her disappearance in 2004.
Now, perhaps he noticed the same discrepancy I did.
Perhaps it was something else.
Either way, I believe that he suspected this girl had taken the place of the real Mina.
Presumably to avail herself of the Davenports' vast wealth.
The girl you're saying isn't Mina, she passed a DNA test.
Tell me that wasn't in Underhill's files?
It was.
Her DNA was a perfect match for the sample taken from Mina's toothbrush in 2004.
Funny thing about that toothbrush.
It disappeared around the same time as the test.
The private lab which compared the two samples chalked it up to human error.
We think the imposter had an accomplice, someone inside the lab who made sure to test her DNA against itself and then got rid of the toothbrush to prevent future tests.
Frankly, Captain, I'm surprised you don't find our thesis more compelling.
I find it compelling as hell, but I also think I'm the only parent in the room.
You know your kids.
I don't care if they're gone ten years or 50.
You know them.
How many of your children have been kidnapped?
I'm merely pointing out that these parents could hardly be blamed for falling prey to a charlatan.
They dreamt of their daughter's safe return for over a decade.
We want to invite them in, break the news to them as gently as possible.
All they have to do is let us take a DNA sample from them, and then we can compare that to the samples taken from the imposter in 2014.
Those, the lab does still have.
They'll prove that she isn't who she says she is.
At the very least, Captain, the Davenports deserve to know whether they have a killer living under their roof.
Mr. Davenport...
thanks for coming.
Yeah.
Of course.
You said you had news.
We do, but... we thought your wife was joining.
Yeah.
She's just right there.
Oh, you brought Mina.
Yeah, well, after you left last night, she just kept asking questions about you and... she knows something's up, so Nancy and I... well, we told her the truth.
She was... very brave.
She, uh, said she wanted to know everything.
Mina... this is Detective Bell.
This is Ms. Watson and Mr. Holmes.
Actually, Mina, we were hoping to talk to your parents alone.
Oh.
Whatever you have to say,
I can hear it.
I never met Agent Underhill, but I know how much he did for my mom and dad.
I want to help.
MINA:
It was my birthday that week.
Not my real birthday;
the one he'd given me.
Keith.
It was the one time of year he was actually nice to me.
It wasn't until later that I realized it was the anniversary of the day he took me.
We had just gotten back from a trip.
So this Keith-- he was, uh, he was a trucker and, uh, he kept you stashed in the back of his, uh, cab during long hauls.
I wasn't allowed to leave the truck, but...
I could look out the window sometimes.
I could see trees, cars... other people.
When I was in the basement, it was...
it was just me.
So, um, according to this file, uh, you-you never had any inkling, uh, what city or state
Keith's home was in.
Well, I was so young when he took me and I wasn't...
I wasn't allowed to watch any TV or look at a newspaper, ever.
The FBI people said that was because he needed me to be completely dependent on him.
It worked.
So you were saying it was the-the week of your birthday...
Keith said it was time.
We started thinking about having a family.
And I, and I couldn't stop thinking about that.
We were on the road.
Another trip.
I... waited until he fell asleep, and then...
I went into his bag.
And I took out the straight razor he used to shave and I held it right up to his neck.
But you didn't do it.
I don't know why,
I just couldn't.
I got out of the truck and I just ran and I didn't stop running until that morning.
HOLMES:
And you were in, uh,
Lander, Pennsylvania.
I didn't know it at the time, but yes.
So then you, um, you shut yourself into a gas station restroom and you take out Keith's straight razor and you cut off all your hair.
Keith forced me to dye my hair blonde.
He had, ever since I was ten.
My therapist said I was reclaiming my old self, but...
(indistinct talking) to be honest...
I don't even remember doing it.
I couldn't even tell you what I was thinking.
Well, what you were thinking is that you wanted to look as pathetic as possible when-when the police found you.
Yeah.
I...
You are one of the best liars
I have ever met, and that's saying something.
It's small wonder you've managed to fool the Davenports.
RICHARD:
No, look, I'm sorry.
What?
I mean, they're still defending you right now.
GREGSON:
Mr. Davenport...
They still believe you're their daughter,
(Richard speaking angrily) ...but we, of course, we know you are not.
Mina, we're leaving.
Dad-Daddy, what's going on?
Come on.
Right now.
It's okay, sweetie, you haven't done anything wrong.
Everything's gonna be okay.
Stay the hell away from my family!
Smells like something died in here.
I'd hardly expect elephant dung to smell like potpourri.
It is, in fact, a highly sought-after coffee, produced by feeding arabica beans to pachyderms in northern Thailand.
And it has the potential to further reduce my need for sleep.
Would you...?
No, thanks.
I had poop for lunch.
You should've seen the Davenports' faces when we broke the news to them.
I mean, I knew they'd take it hard, but I didn't think they'd refuse to give us their DNA.
We underestimated the hold the imposter has over them.
If they won't help prove she's a fraud, we'll just see if she killed Bob Underhill instead.
Yesterday you said you had to accompany your mother to a doctor's appointment in Scarsdale.
That's right.
Only you didn't.
You didn't even see her.
You saw your stepfather instead.
May I assume your visit had something to do with his book?
You know about the book?
An hour ago, I signed for a box which contained nearly 200 copies... but I've been aware of it for months.
An associate brought it to my attention.
You read it?
I did.
You're not mad?
Should I be?
Of course you should, you're you.
It's hardly the first time
I've inspired a writer, Watson.
I am actually the basis for several fictional characters across various media.
It's one of the by-products of my success as a detective.
I fascinate;
this cannot be helped.
You yourself once wrote about me:
The Casebook of Sherlock Holmes.
When did you...?
I was displeased because you used my real name and you shared my real history.
Your father's magnum opus, on the other hand, is the very opposite of real.
Look no further than chapter 32, where we make love beneath a footbridge in Central Park.
Why didn't you tell me about it?
The book, not chapter 32.
Your stepfather uses pseudonym, and I assumed you were the reason for that.
(sighs)
You seem angrier than I'd expected.
May I ask why?
(doorbell buzzes)
Are you expecting someone?
I got your address off the card you left with my parents.
You mean, your marks.
They think I'm at my tutor's right now.
Can I come in?
I'm not sure you should.
There's no wood chipper in here.
Uh... you can frisk me.
Whatever you want.
I...
I just want to talk.
You're right about a lot of things.
But you're wrong about others.
You admit you're not Mina Davenport.
I do.
But I didn't kill that FBI guy.
And why should we believe you?
Because I can tell you who did.
Richard and Nancy.
The Davenports?
And why, pray tell, would they murder the man who worked so hard to find their daughter?
Because... he was about to figure out their secret.
No one took Mina.
They killed her.
My real name is Cassie, but you can call me Mina, if it's easier.
I'm used to it.
You have a second name?
For the purpose of this conversation, no.
There's a reason I came to talk to you and not the police.
Do tell.
Mina turns 21 in a couple of weeks.
Or, at least she would have.
When that happens, I get access to her trust.
There's almost five million in it.
If you keep my secret until then,
I'll tell you everything.
I'll even be your eyes and ears inside the house.
You... you think I'm lying again.
Why would we not?
A couple of years ago, I came across this magazine article.
It was the anniversary of Mina's disappearance, and they did this computer thing to show what she would look like if she were still alive.
I realized I looked like her.
Not a lot, but enough.
I thought if I studied the case, if I learned everything I could about her,
I could fool people.
Because you'd run cons before?
Nothing like this.
This was big.
I had to trick Mina's own parents.
So you came up with a story that would allow for the occasional trip-up.
You were abused, locked in a basement, you forgot your old life;
that way, no one would be suspicious when you had trouble remembering things the real Mina would have known.
My favorite wrinkle was Keith's truck.
You said you'd escaped from it, as opposed to the house, because, like Keith, the house didn't exist, and you didn't have to worry about leading anyone back to it.
I was never worried about fooling the police or the FBI.
Just Richard and Nancy.
I had this whole script ready, things I would say or do, if I thought they were getting suspicious.
Only...
I never needed it.
They treated me like their daughter from the second I met them.
At first I thought I was just that good.
But a couple months ago, something happened.
I, um...
I woke up in the middle of the night and...
Richard was sitting there.
He touched my arm.
He said this was something he and Mina used to do.
He said, "You are my little girl, aren't you?"
You get it, right?
He knew I wasn't her because he'd killed her.
He was abusing her.
She must have threatened to tell someone and...
You said Nancy was involved, too.
No one worked harder to teach me about Mina's old life.
She needed to make sure no one else knew
I wasn't really her daughter.
Because that would guarantee no one would uncover Richard's crime.
He lied to you the other night.
The FBI guy had come to the house.
I saw them arguing in the driveway that night.
I didn't know who he was, so I didn't think much of it at the time, but then, when you guys came to the house, I...
He figured me out.
He must have.
So Richard killed him.
Two weeks-- that's all I need.
You keep all of this between us... and I'll help you get justice for Mina.
Deal.
These are listening devices.
Bugs.
I need you to plant one on the first floor of the Davenports' home and one on the second.
This one's sort of big.
It's imperative you put both of them near windows.
This will make it easier for us to pick up and record their conversations.
Have I made myself clear?
Yeah.
So why are you still here?
I know I did something terrible.
But Richard and Nancy did something worse.
You won't regret this, I promise.
(sighs)
You're almost as good of a liar as she is.
She actually thinks you believe her.
She's obviously attempting to divert attention until she can claim Mina's trust money and disappear.
Then why did you just give her two bugs?
You know she's not gonna say anything incriminating when she's around them.
Actually, Watson, only one of them is a bug.
The other is a flash bang.
You gave her a bomb?
It's a very small bomb with a very big bang.
Tomorrow morning, I will activate the listening device, and when I'm certain all three family members are on one floor,
I'll detonate the flash bang on the other.
If they don't call the police themselves, one of their neighbors will.
And then we can poke around their house without a warrant and collect all the DNA we want.
The Davenports aren't gonna trust any test results from us, not after today.
As I said earlier, I'm only interested in whether our imposter killed Bob Underhill.
His murder was especially violent.
She would have been covered in his blood.
If she carried any trace of it back to the house, we'll have her, no matter who the Davenports think she is.
(siren whooping, indistinct radio communication)
(indistinct chatter)
I thought you said it was a small bomb.
No, no!
No, you people are not coming into my home!
Mr. Davenport, we are here to help you, believe it or not.
Oh, like hell you are.
GREGSON:
Mr. Davenport, I understand you're not happy to see any of us, but when a bomb goes off on your property, you don't get to pick and choose who investigates.
May we assume the explosive device was not yours, Mr. Davenport?
Of course it wasn't.
Well, then, you have our word we will not rest until the guilty party has been identified.
So, uh... (low, indistinct talking)
Hey, I checked the security system.
It was enabled, but it wasn't tripped.
No signs that anyone broke in to plant the device.
Got to be the girl, right?
What are the chances of this happening one day after we accuse her of running a con?
Yeah, but the upside?
She gets to play the victim card again?
WATSON:
Whatever her reasons were, we should be glad.
We have all morning to look for proof she killed Underhill.
BELL:
That was a bust, too.
Her bedroom and bathroom were spotless.
Nothing in the drains, the carpet or the hamper.
Kitchen and, uh, laundry room were equally clean, but let's not forget the obscenity of the Davenports' wealth.
By my count, we still have ten rooms to go.
All right, let's check out CSU, and see how they're doing.
It's because he cheated on my mother.
My stepfather.
You asked me yesterday why I was so angry about the book.
Yes, I remember, and I recall the affair, but what one has to do with the other...?
He was always a free spirit, adventurous, did what he wanted when he wanted.
I loved that about him.
Until what he wanted was something other than Mary.
It wasn't even serious.
Just some woman he met at a book signing, back when he was still putting his name on his own work.
And then my mother found out.
Well, she's a proud woman.
I'm sure it was difficult.
Well, things weren't the same after that.
She and my father patched things up, but I don't know.
I guess I kept him at arm's length.
And then, when he wrote that book, it was like he was thinking about himself again.
Speaking of people who think they can get away with things, look at the seat.
Note how close it is to the pedals.
This has been adjusted for somebody short, not Richard Davenport, who by my estimation is six foot tall.
Nancy, meanwhile, drives this SUV.
I know 'cause I saw her keys at the station yesterday.
So you think this is the car the imposter drives.
Look at the brake pedal.
WATSON:
Blood.
Agent Underhill's, I presume, transferred from the bottom of his killer's shoe.
(doorbell buzzes)
(door opening)
Dad, what are you doing here?
Well, I have something for you, and I thought I'd drop it off in person.
Come in.
Wow.
Really love what you've done with this place.
I'll tell Sherlock.
I'm sure he can do the same for you and Mom.
Is he around?
No, he's at the precinct.
Uh, we're waiting to hear about some blood that we found.
Oh, that sounds exciting.
So did you talk to your publisher?
(sighing) Hey, the wheels are in motion.
I don't know the ins and the outs, but suffice it to say that The Heart Bled Blue is about to become very difficult to find.
I appreciate that.
Mm-hmm.
What's this?
Uh, that's the sequel.
You wrote another book based on me and Sherlock?
Wait-- before you take my head off, I already told the editor that he can't have it;
it's all yours.
I was just putting the finishing touches on it when you came by the house the other day.
I don't understand.
Is this for me to burn?
That's for you to do with whatever you like.
I missed you, Joanie, and that's the real reason
I wrote about you.
I mean, these last few years, ever since I... strayed...
You know, I know that I screwed up.
I knew it the moment that it happened.
But what I didn't know, what I wasn't ready for, was what it would do to us.
You used to be my friend.
And I ruined that.
The book is just my way of dealing with it.
It let me be close to you again.
(phone ringing)
Hmm.
No rest for the weary.
Dad, just... just hold on, okay?
(ringing continues)
Hello?
HOLMES:
The blood on the brake pedal came from Bob Underhill.
I didn't think we'd hear back from the lab this quickly.
We didn't hear back from the lab.
We heard from Richard Davenport.
He's here, and he claims he killed Underhill, and he wants to confess.
HOLMES:
Oh, she's told him a sob story.
She must have.
Something along the lines of, "The mean FBI man confronted me,
"accused me of all the things the police did.
I was frightened, I snapped."
He's still utterly convinced she's his daughter.
She knew he blamed himself for what happened to the real Mina.
In 2004, he couldn't save her.
In 2015, he can.
Well, however she did it, she's forcing our hand.
We either got to charge him or find some way of proving that he's covering for her.
HOLMES:
I think the choice is clear.
Mina, or whatever her name is, in a rush to escape a murder charge, has made a mistake.
Accept the false confession and book Richard Davenport.
That will make it easier to obtain a sample of his DNA.
WATSON:
We can compare it to the samples that were taken from the imposter when she turned up last year.
We can show him the results.
There you go.
I'm not sure that would have been enough to convince him, but now, staring down the barrel of life in prison, we might be able to get him to see the light.
WATSON:
The DNA was a match?
This can't be right.
All I can tell you is what the lab told me.
The girl's DNA is a familial match to Richard Davenport.
According to the report, she's his daughter.
It's the same results as the original report that matched her to Mina's toothbrush.
Now, I know you thought she had an accomplice, someone on the inside.
This test was done in-house.
We put a rush on it.
There is no way she could have effected the results.
HOLMES:
Then someone made a mistake.
The girl that we're dealing with is not Mina Davenport.
Her genetic material says otherwise.
What about her ears?
It doesn't trump a DNA test.
It says there that Richard Davenport's DNA was compared to a sample of the imposter's hair.
That's right.
Wouldn't it have been standard procedure to take a cheek swab when she was oh-so-miraculously found 14 months ago?
It would, but the FBI said she was in such a feral state, she wouldn't let anyone near her.
So they bagged the hair that she had cut off in the gas station bathroom.
BELL:
Maybe she's not Mina, but she is Davenport's daughter.
Well, say he had an affair.
The girl was born out of wedlock.
She pretended to be Mina to mess with him, get everything she thought she deserved.
Well, that would actually explain a lot.
No.
Respectfully, Detective, I don't like that theory.
That's a bad theory.
GREGSON:
Why is it a bad theory?
'Cause it wouldn't account for Mina, the real Mina, and what happened to her in 2004.
BELL:
It's not supposed to.
It's supposed to explain how a girl we think is a fraud passed a DNA test.
I've got a different theory-- better one.
I mean, I-I prefer it.
Trust me when I say that you will, too.
Mrs. Davenport, thank you so much for coming.
This is my attorney,
Mr. O'Donnell.
HOLMES:
Earlier today, the woman that you know as your daughter...
She is my daughter.
She passed a DNA test, or at least a strand of her hair did.
It was a familial match for a cheek swab taken from your husband.
WATSON:
The thing is, that hair did not come directly from Mina's head.
It was one of the hairs that she claimed she cut off with a straight razor the day she was found.
Claimed?
This was the second test she passed.
We were suspicious of the test she took 14 months ago, because Mina's toothbrush, the source of the comparison sample-- disappeared.
But then, this morning, when the results of the second test arrived, we wondered what if the loss of the toothbrush really was human error?
What if she had passed both tests because the hair that was examined really did come from Mina?
You're not making any sense.
Please.
HOLMES:
It occurred to me that if someone had access to Mina's hair 14 months ago, then they also had access to Mina...
WATSON:
It was hard to imagine a woman allowing someone to take a straight razor to her head willingly.
So we reached out to law enforcement across the country.
We found a report of an assault in Sturbridge, Massachusetts, where a young woman wearing a mask attacked another young woman and shaved her head.
HOLMES:
Not the kind of crime you see every day.
Even more remarkable-- the assault was perpetrated just two days... before the imposter was found in Lander, Pennsylvania.
She'd located Mina, you see.
And instead of reporting it to the authorities, she took her hair.
She then scattered that around in Pennsylvania as if it was her own.
The victim of the Sturbridge attack gave a fake name at the hospital.
She was signed out by a man named Norman Ott.
Mr. Ott, it turns out, lived near Mina's school in 2004.
His apartment was on a route she would've taken home.
It's really her, Nancy.
It's really Mina.
It...
No.
I...
It can't...
HOLMES:
When the police paid a visit to Mr. Ott's home in Sturbridge today;
he wasn't home, but Mina was.
WATSON:
Over the years, he told different stories about her.
Some people thought she was his daughter.
Others thought she was his wife.
The only thing we know for sure is that she was allowed to leave the house sometimes.
That's how the imposter was able to gain access to her.
HOLMES:
You can imagine she's been through quite an ordeal, but she remembers you and Richard, and she's been asking for you.
So as soon as he's recanted his confession, he'll be brought here.
Would you like me to take you to see her?
(quiet sob)
Hi.
Joanie, what are you...?
I'm sorry I got so angry about the book.
Oh, you don't have anything to apologize for.
Come in.
Well, I've changed my mind.
I'm okay with it being out there, so whatever you told your publishers to do, you can tell them to stop.
It's all right.
You're sure?
I read the sequel.
I actually think it's better than the first.
Yeah.
A-And you...
you made some notes.
Just a few.
I thought we could spend some time and talk about them.
Well... it would be an honor.
♪ All we do is hide away
♪ All we do is, all we do is hide away... ♪
HOLMES:
Cassie?
♪ All we do is chase the day... ♪
Mind if I call you Cassie?
I'd call you by your real name, but you're refusing to give it.
Cassie is fine.
Sorry I missed your arrest and booking, but I've been coordinating the effort to identify you.
To my great surprise, your fingerprints weren't in AFIS.
Of course they aren't.
I've never committed any crimes.
You've never been caught.
Is there a difference?
So how old are you?
Really?
Fifteen.
No, wait.
Twenty-five.
Or maybe it's some other number.
My colleagues showed your photograph to Mina Davenport.
She says she's never seen you before.
You're also a stranger to Norman Ott.
He was taken into custody yesterday.
Who?
He wasn't lying when he said he never met you before.
I could tell.
Would you at least concede you spent some time in Sturbridge?
How else would you know about Mina's situation?
I've been to lots of places.
Have you enjoyed them?
'Cause your time of coming and going is now squarely in the past.
You think I killed that FBI agent, but... you don't have a murder weapon, just some blood in a car.
I've already come up with six different ways to explain it.
Tell me one.
(sighs):
Um...
I hope you come to my trial.
Should be fun.
Think you can lie your way out?
I do.
Now tell me... am I lying?

My sister is a big reader.
She's always got a book in her hands.
Most of it's crap-- the kind of books, you know, you buy at the airport and leave on the plane.
Anyway...
For the last couple of months, she has been hounding me to read this.
Theheartbledblue.
You ever heard of it?
No.
Does the author's name ring a bell?
No.
Why?
Because it's about two detectives.
One is a beautiful Chinese-American woman.
The other, her partner, is a guy from London.
You're kidding.
They live together.
They consult for the NYPD.
Their names aren't Holmes and Watson, but still.
You may not know grover ogden, but he seems to know a lot about you.
(Chain saws buzzing)
(Saw revving, buzzing)
I'm not paying your guys to sit around, Vince.
What's the holdup?
Couldn't get the chipper going when we got here.
I think it's jammed.
It was fine yesterday.
Vince:
Repair guy's on his way.
How long are we talking?
Um, hour.
Maybe two?
I got ten more plots to clear before I can stop pouring foundations.
Where's the jam?
Probably somewhere between the drum and the cutter knives.
(Grunts)
I got it!
Start it up.
(Engine starting) Whoa!
Shut it down!
Right now!
What now?
Look.

Gregson:
Believe it or not, this used to be an FBI agent.
Or, at least, that's what the badge says.
Lab is running the DNA to make sure.
Special agent Robert underhill, retired.
His car was found about 200 yards from the scene.
Gregson:
I reached out to the bureau's New York office;
they're standing by to help, but...
Since underhill was officially a civilian, it's our case.
No Joan today?
She's going to join us later.
So what else do we know about special agent underhill?
An exemplary 34-year career, well-liked by his colleagues.
He and his wife Sheila moved to kauai, 2012.
They moved back to New York about seven months ago.
Well, assuming this is special agent underhill, he would've been dead before he went into the wood chipper.
The killer would've had to dismember him in order to get him through the infeed chute.
Right, so csu examined all the chain saws that were used at the site, and found one with some blood between the teeth.
(Sniffing)
They think someone used it and then cleaned it last night.
Oleoresin capsicum.
More commonly known as... (Sniffs) Pepper spray.
We should alert the m.E. That this bag contains at least part of the face.
I'm sure he'll appreciate that.
So the bootprint found next to his car suggests he drove there himself.
Pepper spray, it's a close-range weapon.
Whoever deployed it would have had to have been close to him.
You think he was invited to the scene, knew his attacker.
The agent was a large man-- at least 220 pounds.
So if I was going to turn him into pulp,
I'd want him as close to that wood chipper as possible.
You said his wife's name was Sheila?
Mm.
We should talk to her, see if she knows her way around a chain saw.
What makes you think she did this?
Well, his personal effects are here.
I see the remains of a wallet, watch...
There's no wedding ring.
And this bag, amongst the skin and bones, has flecks of latex and foil.
Looks like he was carrying at least one wrapped condom with him.
So he may not have been ready for a fight, but...
He was ready for fun.
Bob wasn't cheating on me.
At least, not with another woman.
The only affair he ever had was with his job.
It was our understanding your husband retired in 2012.
He did.
We sold our house and moved to kauai.
Then he got restless.
Missed his work, missed the city.
I could tell he wasn't happy, so I agreed to move back.
Holmes:
Respectfully,
Mrs. underhill, we found evidence that he may have still been restless:
The remains of two unused prophylactics.
We separated six months ago.
It was amicable.
We stayed in touch.
So you separated but didn't divorce.
I'm guessing that means you're still his primary beneficiary.
You'd have been entitled to his pension, his life insurance...
I had dinner at my daughter's house in New Jersey last night.
Drank half a bottle of rosé, spent the night in the guest room.
Can anyone other than your daughter confirm that?
I took a train back to the city this morning.
There should be a record of my ticket purchase and...
Security footage from stations.
All right, we'll look into it.
In the meantime, can you think of anyone who would've wanted to hurt your husband?
After we moved back to New York,
Bob started looking into some of his old cases.
Ones that he never solved.
He asked a friend at the bureau for copies of a bunch of files.
The last time we spoke, he said he thought one of those cases was finally going to crack.
He was closing in on someone.
Who?
I don't know.
Out of respect, he kept shop talk to a minimum after we separated.
But I'm sure if you go to his apartment, you'll find all the files.
They may tell you everything you need to know.
(Knocking on door)
Joanie.
My gosh.
It's been months.
You look beautiful.
Thanks, dad.
Or should I call you grover ogden?
What were you thinking?
I was honoring you.
The choices you make, the work you do.
I think it's wonderful.
Really?
So that's why you didn't ask my permission.
That's why you used a pseudonym.
Because you knew how honored I would be.
Did you even read the book?
Of course I read the book.
And?
It's ridiculous.
Sherlock and I do not run around with guns and we don't get into kung fu fights with criminals and we sure as hell do not sleep together.
Well, sex sells, joanie.
You know that.
So how did you know that that was me?
Grover ogden?
We lived on ogden Avenue.
Grover was our dog.
And by the way, that is how you make a porn name, not a pen name!
Okay, look, i owed my publishers a book.
I was blocked.
I've never been blocked like this before.
I was going crazy.
So your mother comes home from seeing you in the city, and she tells me about this case you're working on, so...
Did she know about this?
No.
I'm just telling you how it all happened.
I don't care how it happened.
I just want it to go away.
Well, what does that mean?
Theheartbledblue didn't get the e-book treatment, which is good, for both of us, because I spent almost $4,000 last night trying to find all the hard copies I could find online.
You're gonna contact your publisher and you're gonna track down the rest.
(Chuckling):
You can't be serious.
Did Sherlock read the book?
What does that have to do with anything?
Well, you gave your opinion.
I'd like to know his.
Okay, first, you are not friends.
You met him once, at aunt Vivian's funeral.
Second, he is never gonna find out about this.
He is the most private person that I know.
He would freak if he found out.
Call your publisher, dad.
I mean it.
Holmes:
Typically, I'm averse to color coordination, but I dare say it brightens the place up.
What is all this?
The case files of the late Bob underhill.
You got my texts?
Murdered FBI agent fed through a wood chipper.
His wife thought it was over one of his unsolved cases.
Marcus and I went to his apartment and discovered he had been revisiting three of them.
I made copies of his files and assigned each case its own room.
As you can see, the library tells the tale of a hate crime, a church burnt to the ground in 1981.
The arsonist, never identified.
You think that's who killed underhill?
I do not.
Thanks in no small part to the late agent's meticulous notes,
I identified the guilty party.
He died in 1982.
This case took longer to solve, but not much.
Two-man bank robbery from 1997.
As it turns out, both parties went to jail for unrelated crimes in the early aughts.
Both parties remain incarcerated, so they're not our killers either.
Finally, the case of a serial poisoner who took six lives between 2008 and 2012.
I realized that the culprit was, in fact, the brother of one of underhill's original suspects.
The only problem, he's in the Navy and he was on an aircraft carrier in the Arabian sea last night.
So you took the three cases this guy couldn't crack over an entire career and you solved them in a few hours.
Bad news is his wife was wrong.
Underhill's old cases had nothing to do with his murder.
Actually, i think one of them did.
I asked the captain to find out if underhill had requested any other case files, and it turns out he had.
Mina Davenport.
Oh, you're familiar with the case?
Of course.
She was kidnapped in 2004.
The guy who took her kept her in a basement.
Ten years later, she escaped and came home-- it was a huge story.
Are you saying that underhill worked her abduction in '04?
He did.
And again in 2015.
He asked for and received copies of her case file just a few months ago.
Curious, then, that they were not amongst his many other materials.
Well, Mina's kidnapper was never found.
You think that's who underhill was closing in on?
I think the absence of the files the agent requested is very suspicious.
Perhaps the killer removed them from his person last night.
Perhaps, post-mulching, he used his keys to access his apartment.
Either way, it could mean that Mina's abductor committed a murder less than 20 miles from her home last night.
Woman:
It's hard to explain, losing your only child when she's ten, and then getting her back at 20.
People tend to think about the ten years you lost, but we could only think about the future;
all the time we were gonna have together after all.
It was a gift.
But we knew there was a catch, that the monster who had taken Mina was still out there.
Bell:
Like I said, we can't be sure he's the one who killed Bob underhill.
We wanted to know if you've seen anything out of the ordinary lately, any strange faces or vehicles?
No.
Nothing.
What about Mina?
If she had, she would've told us.
Is she here?
She's upstairs with her tutor.
She's working on her ged.
I mean, if it's all the same to you,
I'd rather not bring her into this.
If we're right, Mr. Davenport, she may be at the very center of it.
Richard:
Well, if you're right.
If you're not, you could just upset her.
You could set her back months.
We've worked so hard to make her feel safe;
to help her find some peace.
After she first got away, she wouldn't let anyone touch her, not for weeks.
Now she'll let me hold her hand again.
She'll...
Let me hug her.
What about Bob underhill?
Had you heard from him lately?
(Sighs)
I wish we had.
Uh...
Look, a... a-after this happened, i-i, um...
I-i could hardly function.
I was the one who was supposed to pick Mina up from school that day;
i-i was the one who let the meeting run long, I...
I mean, it was my fault that she tried to walk home and, um... (Sighs) ...when I could do nothing, agent underhill did everything.
He was, uh...
He was our rock.
Holmes:
We knew that Mina was able to help the FBI generate a sketch of her captor.
She even, uh, provided a first name:
Keith.
In the months since her return, has she remembered any other salient details?
Anything that might help us identify him?
I'm sorry.
No.
Mina:
Mom... dad...
Is everything okay?
It's all right, sweetie.
We'll be done in here in just a minute.
Bell:
Davenportsmaynothave seenKeitharound, but that doesn't mean we can't circulate his sketch.
Watson:
Even if he didn't kill underhill, he's still worth finding.
Assuming a figment of someone's imagination can be found.
What is that supposed to mean?
That man did not kill agent underhill, nor did he kidnap that young woman.
The description she gave is entirely fictional.
Hold up-- are you calling Mina Davenport a liar?
No, I'm calling that young girl a liar.
She's not Mina Davenport.
She's an imposter.
Holmes:
The old proverb says the eyes are the window to the soul.
In this case, it's the ears.
Note, in each image, the depth of the triangular fossa and the degree of attachment of the lobule.
These are the ears of two different people.
They don't look that different to me.
Watson?
He's right.
The architecture of the second ear is all wrong.
Mina Davenport disappeared when she was ten years old.
She grew;
She changed.
Her body changed.
But not her ears.
They grow as kids get older, but they don't change shape.
Basically, this girl could not have grown up to become this girl.
We no longer think that agent underhill was onto Mina Davenport's abductor.
We believe he was onto her imposter.
Because of ears.
Six months ago, the first pictures of miracle Mina were released by her family to the press.
Two weeks later, agent underhill requested copies of any and all files pertaining to her disappearance in 2004.
Now, perhaps he noticed the same discrepancy I did.
Perhaps it was something else.
Either way, I believe that he suspected this girl had taken the place of the real Mina.
Presumably to avail herself of the davenports' vast wealth.
The girl you're saying isn't Mina, she passed a DNA test.
Tell me that wasn't in underhill's files?
It was.
Her DNA was a perfect match for the sample taken from Mina's toothbrush in 2004.
Funny thing about that toothbrush.
It disappeared around the same time as the test.
The private lab which compared the two samples chalked it up to human error.
We think the imposter had an accomplice, someone inside the lab who made sure to test her DNA against itself and then got rid of the toothbrush to prevent future tests.
Frankly, captain, I'm surprised you don't find our thesis more compelling.
I find it compelling as hell, but I also think I'm the only parent in the room.
You know your kids.
I don't care if they're gone ten years or 50.
You know them.
How many of your children have been kidnapped?
I'm merely pointing out that these parents could hardly be blamed for falling prey to a charlatan.
They dreamt of their daughter's safe return for over a decade.
We want to invite them in, break the news to them as gently as possible.
All they have to do is let us take a DNA sample from them, and then we can compare that to the samples taken from the imposter in 2014.
Those, the lab does still have.
They'll prove that she isn't who she says she is.
At the very least, captain, the davenports deserve to know whether they have a killer living under their roof.
Mr. Davenport...
Thanks for coming.
Yeah.
Of course.
You said you had news.
We do, but...
We thought your wife was joining.
Yeah.
She's just right there.
Oh, you brought Mina.
Yeah, well, after you left last night, she just kept asking questions about you and... she knows something's up, so Nancy and I...
Well, we told her the truth.
She was... very brave.
She, uh, said she wanted to know everything.
Mina...
This is detective bell.
This is Ms. Watson and Mr. Holmes.
Actually, Mina, we were hoping to talk to your parents alone.
Oh.
Whatever you have to say,
I can hear it.
I never met agent underhill, but I know how much he did for my mom and dad.
I want to help.
Mina:
It was my birthday that week.
Not my real birthday;
The one he'd given me.
Keith.
It was the one time of year he was actually nice to me.
It wasn't until later that I realized it was the anniversary of the day he took me.
We had just gotten back from a trip.
So this Keith-- he was, uh, he was a trucker and, uh, he kept you stashed in the back of his, uh, cab during long hauls.
I wasn't allowed to leave the truck, but...
I could look out the window sometimes.
I could see trees, cars...
Other people.
When I was in the basement, it was...
It was just me.
So, um, according to this file, uh, you-you never had any inkling, uh, what city or state
Keith's home was in.
Well, I was so young when he took me and I wasn't...
I wasn't allowed to watch any TV or look at a newspaper, ever.
The FBI people said that was because he needed me to be completely dependent on him.
It worked.
So you were saying it was the-the week of your birthday...
Keith said it was time.
We started thinking about having a family.
And I, and I couldn't stop thinking about that.
We were on the road.
Another trip.
I... waited until he fell asleep, and then...
I went into his bag.
And I took out the straight razor he used to shave and I held it right up to his neck.
But you didn't do it.
I don't know why,
I just couldn't.
I got out of the truck and I just ran and I didn't stop running until that morning.
Holmes:
And you were in, uh, lander, Pennsylvania.
I didn't know it at the time, but yes.
So then you, um, you shut yourself into a gas station restroom and you take out Keith's straight razor and you cut off all your hair.
Keith forced me to dye my hair blonde.
He had, ever since I was ten.
My therapist said I was reclaiming my old self, but...
(Indistinct talking)
To be honest...
I don't even remember doing it.
I couldn't even tell you what I was thinking.
Well, what you were thinking is that you wanted to look as pathetic as possible when-when the police found you.
Yeah.
I...
You are one of the best liars
I have ever met, and that's saying something.
It's small wonder you've managed to fool the davenports.
Richard:
No, look, I'm sorry.
What?
I mean, they're still defending you right now.
Gregson:
Mr. Davenport...
They still believe you're their daughter,
(Richard speaking angrily) ...But we, of course, we know you are not.
Mina, we're leaving.
Dad-daddy, what's going on?
Come on.
Right now.
It's okay, sweetie, you haven't done anything wrong.
Everything's gonna be okay.
Stay the hell away from my family!
Smells like something died in here.
I'd hardly expect elephant dung to smell like potpourri.
It is, in fact, a highly sought-after coffee, produced by feeding arabica beans to pachyderms in northern Thailand.
And it has the potential to further reduce my need for sleep.
Would you...?
No, thanks.
I had poop for lunch.
You should've seen the davenports' faces when we broke the news to them.
I mean, I knew they'd take it hard, but I didn't think they'd refuse to give us their DNA.
We underestimated the hold the imposter has over them.
If they won't help prove she's a fraud, we'll just see if she killed Bob underhill instead.
Yesterday you said you had to accompany your mother to a doctor's appointment in scarsdale.
That's right.
Only you didn't.
You didn't even see her.
You saw your stepfather instead.
May I assume your visit had something to do with his book?
You know about the book?
An hour ago, I signed for a box which contained nearly 200 copies... but I've been aware of it for months.
An associate brought it to my attention.
You read it?
I did.
You're not mad?
Should I be?
Of course you should, you're you.
It's hardly the first time
I've inspired a writer, Watson.
I am actually the basis for several fictional characters across various media.
It's one of the by-products of my success as a detective.
I fascinate;
This cannot be helped.
You yourself once wrote about me:
Thecasebook ofSherlockHolmes.
When did you...?
I was displeased because you used my real name and you shared my real history.
Your father's Magnum opus, on the other hand, is the very opposite of real.
Look no further than chapter 32, where we make love beneath a footbridge in central park.
Why didn't you tell me about it?
The book, not chapter 32.
Your stepfather uses pseudonym, and I assumed you were the reason for that.
(Sighs)
You seem angrier than I'd expected.
May I ask why?
(Doorbell buzzes)
Are you expecting someone?
I got your address off the card you left with my parents.
You mean, your marks.
They think I'm at my tutor's right now.
Can I come in?
I'm not sure you should.
There's no wood chipper in here.
Uh... you can frisk me.
Whatever you want.
I...
I just want to talk.
You're right about a lot of things.
But you're wrong about others.
You admit you're not Mina Davenport.
I do.
But I didn't kill that FBI guy.
And why should we believe you?
Because i can tell you who did.
Richard and Nancy.
The davenports?
And why, pray tell, would they murder the man who worked so hard to find their daughter?
Because...
He was about to figure out their secret.
No one took Mina.
Theykilledher.
My real name is Cassie, but you can call me Mina, if it's easier.
I'm used to it.
You have a second name?
For the purpose of this conversation, no.
There's a reason I came to talk to you and not the police.
Do tell.
Mina turns 21 in a couple of weeks.
Or, at least she would have.
When that happens, i get access to her trust.
There's almost five million in it.
If you keep my secret until then,
I'll tell you everything.
I'll even be your eyes and ears inside the house.
You... you think I'm lying again.
Why would we not?
A couple of years ago, I came across this magazine article.
It was the anniversary of Mina's disappearance, and they did this computer thing to show what she would look like if she were still alive.
I realized I looked like her.
Not a lot, but enough.
I thought if i studied the case, if I learned everything i could about her,
I could fool people.
Because you'd run cons before?
Nothing like this.
This was big.
I had to trick Mina's own parents.
So you came up with a story that would allow for the occasional trip-up.
You were abused, locked in a basement, you forgot your old life;
That way, no one would be suspicious when you had trouble remembering things the real Mina would have known.
My favorite wrinkle was Keith's truck.
You said you'd escaped from it, as opposed to the house, because, like Keith, the house didn't exist, and you didn't have to worry about leading anyone back to it.
I was never worried about fooling the police or the FBI.
Just Richard and Nancy.
I had this whole script ready, things I would say or do, if I thought they were getting suspicious.
Only...
I never needed it.
They treated me like their daughter from the second I met them.
At first I thought i was just that good.
But a couple months ago, something happened.
I, um...
I woke up in the middle of the night and...
Richard was sitting there.
He touched my arm.
He said this was something he and Mina used to do.
He said, "you are my little girl, aren't you?"
You get it, right?
He knew I wasn't her because he'd killed her.
He was abusing her.
She must have threatened to tell someone and...
You said Nancy was involved, too.
No one worked harder to teach me about Mina's old life.
She needed to make sure no one else knew
I wasn't really her daughter.
Because that would guarantee no one would uncover Richard's crime.
He lied to you the other night.
The FBI guy had come to the house.
I saw them arguing in the driveway that night.
I didn't know who he was, so I didn't think much of it at the time, but then, when you guys came to the house, I...
He figured me out.
He must have.
So Richard killed him.
Two weeks-- that's all I need.
You keep all of this between us...
And I'll help you get justice for Mina.
Deal.
These are listening devices.
Bugs.
I need you to plant one on the first floor of the davenports' home and one on the second.
This one's sort of big.
It's imperative you put both of them near windows.
This will make it easier for us to pick up and record their conversations.
Have I made myself clear?
Yeah.
So why are you still here?
I know I did something terrible.
But Richard and Nancy did something worse.
You won't regret this, I promise.
(Sighs)
You're almost as good of a liar as she is.
She actually thinks you believe her.
She's obviously attempting to divert attention until she can claim Mina's trust money and disappear.
Then why did you just give her two bugs?
You know she's not gonna say anything incriminating when she's around them.
Actually, Watson, only one of them is a bug.
The other is a flash bang.
You gave her a bomb?
It's a very small bomb with a very big bang.
Tomorrow morning, I will activate the listening device, and when I'm certain all three family members are on one floor,
I'll detonate the flash bang on the other.
If they don't call the police themselves, one of their neighbors will.
And then we can poke around their house without a warrant and collect all the DNA we want.
The davenports aren't gonna trust any test results from us, not after today.
As I said earlier, I'm only interested in whether our imposter killed Bob underhill.
His murder was especially violent.
She would have been covered in his blood.
If she carried any trace of it back to the house, we'll have her, no matter who the davenports think she is.
(Siren whooping, indistinct radio communication)
(Indistinct chatter)
I thought you said it was a small bomb.
No, no!
No, you people are not coming into my home!
Mr. Davenport, we are here to help you, believe it or not.
Oh, like hell you are.
Gregson:
Mr. Davenport, i understand you're not happy to see any of us, but when a bomb goes off on your property, you don't get to pick and choose who investigates.
May we assume the explosive device was not yours, Mr. Davenport?
Of course it wasn't.
Well, then, you have our word we will not rest until the guilty party has been identified.
So, uh... (Low, indistinct talking)
Hey, I checked the security system.
It was enabled, but it wasn't tripped.
No signs that anyone broke in to plant the device.
Got to be the girl, right?
What are the chances of this happening one day after we accuse her of running a con?
Yeah, but the upside?
She gets to play the victim card again?
Watson:
Whatever her reasons were, we should be glad.
We have all morning to look for proof she killed underhill.
Bell:
That was a bust, too.
Her bedroom and bathroom were spotless.
Nothing in the drains, the carpet or the hamper.
Kitchen and, uh, laundry room were equally clean, but let's not forget the obscenity of the davenports' wealth.
By my count, we still have ten rooms to go.
All right, let's check out csu, and see how they're doing.
It's because he cheated on my mother.
My stepfather.
You asked me yesterday why i was so angry about the book.
Yes, I remember, and I recall the affair, but what one has to do with the other...?
He was always a free spirit, adventurous, did what he wanted when he wanted.
I loved that about him.
Until what he wanted was something other than Mary.
It wasn't even serious.
Just some woman he met at a book signing, back when he was still putting his name on his own work.
And then my mother found out.
Well, she's a proud woman.
I'm sure it was difficult.
Well, things weren't the same after that.
She and my father patched things up, but I don't know.
I guess I kept him at arm's length.
And then, when he wrote that book, it was like he was thinking about himself again.
Speaking of people who think they can get away with things, look at the seat.
Note how close it is to the pedals.
This has been adjusted for somebody short, not Richard Davenport, who by my estimation is six foot tall.
Nancy, meanwhile, drives this SUV.
I know 'cause i saw her keys at the station yesterday.
So you think this is the car the imposter drives.
Look at the brake pedal.
Watson:
Blood.
Agent underhill's, i presume, transferred from the bottom of his killer's shoe.
(Doorbell buzzes)
(Door opening)
Dad, what are you doing here?
Well, I have something for you, and I thought I'd drop it off in person.
Come in.
Wow.
Really love what you've done with this place.
I'll tell Sherlock.
I'm sure he can do the same for you and mom.
Is he around?
No, he's at the precinct.
Uh, we're waiting to hear about some blood that we found.
Oh, that sounds exciting.
So did you talk to your publisher?
(Sighing) Hey, the wheels are in motion.
I don't know the ins and the outs, but suffice it to say that the heart bled blue is about to become very difficult to find.
I appreciate that.
Mm-hmm.
What's this?
Uh, that's the sequel.
You wrote another book based on me and Sherlock?
Wait-- before you take my head off, I already told the editor that he can't have it;
It's all yours.
I was just putting the finishing touches on it when you came by the house the other day.
I don't understand.
Is this for me to burn?
That's for you to do with whatever you like.
I missed you, joanie, and that's the real reason
I wrote about you.
I mean, these last few years, ever since I... strayed...
You know, I know that I screwed up.
I knew it the moment that it happened.
But what I didn't know, what I wasn't ready for, was what it would do to us.
You used to be my friend.
And I ruined that.
The book is just my way of dealing with it.
It let me be close to you again.
(Phone ringing)
Hmm.
No rest for the weary.
Dad, just...
Just hold on, okay?
(Ringing continues)
Hello?
Holmes:
The blood on the brake pedal came from Bob underhill.
I didn't think we'd hear back from the lab this quickly.
We didn't hear back from the lab.
We heard from Richard Davenport.
He's here, and he claims he killed underhill, and he wants to confess.
Holmes:
Oh, she's told him a sob story.
She must have.
Something along the lines of, "the mean FBI man confronted me,
"accused me of all the things the police did.
I was frightened, i snapped."
He's still utterly convinced she's his daughter.
She knew he blamed himself for what happened to the real Mina.
In 2004, he couldn't save her.
In 2015, he can.
Well, however she did it, she's forcing our hand.
We either got to charge him or find some way of proving that he's covering for her.
Holmes:
I think the choice is clear.
Mina, or whatever her name is, in a rush to escape a murder charge, has made a mistake.
Accept the false confession and book Richard Davenport.
That will make it easier to obtain a sample of his DNA.
Watson:
We can compare it to the samples that were taken from the imposter when she turned up last year.
We can show him the results.
There you go.
I'm not sure that would have been enough to convince him, but now, staring down the barrel of life in prison, we might be able to get him to see the light.
Watson:
The DNA was a match?
This can't be right.
All I can tell you is what the lab told me.
The girl's DNA is a familial match to Richard Davenport.
According to the report, she's his daughter.
It's the same results as the original report that matched her to Mina's toothbrush.
Now, I know you thought she had an accomplice, someone on the inside.
This test was done in-house.
We put a rush on it.
There is no way she could have effected the results.
Holmes:
Then someone made a mistake.
The girl that we're dealing with is not Mina Davenport.
Her genetic material says otherwise.
What about her ears?
It doesn't trump a DNA test.
It says there that Richard Davenport's DNA was compared to a sample of the imposter's hair.
That's right.
Wouldn't it have been standard procedure to take a cheek swab when she was oh-so-miraculously found 14 months ago?
It would, but the FBI said she was in such a feral state, she wouldn't let anyone near her.
So they bagged the hair that she had cut off in the gas station bathroom.
Bell:
Maybe she's not Mina, but she is Davenport's daughter.
Well, say he had an affair.
The girl was born out of wedlock.
She pretended to be Mina to mess with him, get everything she thought she deserved.
Well, that would actually explain a lot.
No.
Respectfully, detective, i don't like that theory.
That's a bad theory.
Gregson:
Why is it a bad theory?
'Cause it wouldn't account for Mina, the real Mina, and what happened to her in 2004.
Bell:
It's not supposed to.
It's supposed to explain how a girl we think is a fraud passed a DNA test.
I've got a different theory-- better one.
I mean, i-i prefer it.
Trust me when I say that you will, too.
Mrs. Davenport, thank you so much for coming.
This is my attorney,
Mr. O'Donnell.
Holmes:
Earlier today, the woman that you know as your daughter...
She is my daughter.
She passed a DNA test, or at least a strand of her hair did.
It was a familial match for a cheek swab taken from your husband.
Watson:
The thing is, that hair did not come directly from Mina's head.
It was one of the hairs that she claimed she cut off with a straight razor the day she was found.
Claimed?
This was the second test she passed.
We were suspicious of the test she took 14 months ago, because Mina's toothbrush, the source of the comparison sample-- disappeared.
But then, this morning, when the results of the second test arrived, we wondered what if the loss of the toothbrush really was human error?
What if she had passed both tests because the hair that was examined really did come from Mina?
You're not making any sense.
Please.
Holmes:
It occurred to me that if someone had access to Mina's hair 14 months ago, then they also had access to Mina...
Watson:
It was hard to imagine a woman allowing someone to take a straight razor to her head willingly.
So we reached out to law enforcement across the country.
We found a report of an assault in sturbridge, Massachusetts, where a young woman wearing a mask attacked another young woman and shaved her head.
Holmes:
Not the kind of crime you see every day.
Even more remarkable-- the assault was perpetrated just two days...
Before the imposter was found in lander, Pennsylvania.
She'd located Mina, you see.
Andinsteadof reportingit totheauthorities, shetookherhair.
She then scattered that aroundinPennsylvania asifit washer own .
The victim of the sturbridge attack gave a fake name at the hospital.
She was signed out by a man named Norman ott.
Mr. ott, it turns out, lived near Mina's school in 2004.
His apartment was on a route she would've taken home.
It's really her, Nancy.
It's really Mina.
It... no.
I... it can't...
Holmes:
When the police paid a visit to Mr. ott's home in sturbridge today;
he wasn't home, but Mina was.
Watson:
Over the years, he told different stories about her.
Some people thought she was his daughter.
Others thought she was his wife.
The only thing we know for sure is that she was allowed to leave the house sometimes.
That's how the imposter was able to gain access to her.
Holmes:
You can imagine she's been through quite an ordeal, but she remembers you and Richard, and she's been asking for you.
So as soon as he's recanted his confession, he'll be brought here.
Would you like me to take you to see her?
(Quiet sob)
Hi.
Joanie, what are you...?
I'm sorry I got so angry about the book.
Oh, you don't have anything to apologize for.
Come in.
Well, I've changed my mind.
I'm okay with it being out there, so whatever you told your publishers to do, you can tell them to stop.
It's all right.
You're sure?
I read the sequel.
I actually think it's better than the first.
Yeah.
A-and you...
You made some notes.
Just a few.
I thought we could spend some time and talk about them.
Well...
It would be an honor.

I'd call you by your real name, but you're refusing to give it.
Cassie is fine.
Sorry I missed your arrest and booking, but I've been coordinating the effort to identify you.
To my great surprise, your fingerprints weren't in AFIS.
Of course they aren't.
I've never committed any crimes.
You've never been caught.
Is there a difference?
So how old are you?
Really?
Fifteen.
No, wait.
Twenty-five.
Or maybe it's some other number.
My colleagues showed your photograph to Mina Davenport.
She says she's never seen you before.
You're also a stranger to Norman ott.
He was taken into custody yesterday.
Who?
He wasn't lying when he said he never met you before.
I could tell.
Would you at least concede you spent some time in sturbridge?
How else would you know about Mina's situation?
I've been to lots of places.
Have you enjoyed them?
'Cause your time of coming and going is now squarely in the past.
You think I killed that FBI agent, but...
You don't have a murder weapon, just some blood in a car.
I've already come up with six different ways to explain it.
Tell me one.

My sister is a big reader.
She's always got a book in her hands.
Most of it's crap-- the kind of books, you know, you buy at the airport and leave on the plane.
Anyway...
for the last couple of months, she has been hounding me to read this.
The Heart Bled Blue.
You ever heard of it?
- No.
Does the author's name ring a bell?
No.
Why?
Because it's about two detectives.
One is a beautiful Chinese-American woman.
The other, her partner, is a guy from London.
You're kidding.
They live together.
They consult for the NYPD.
Their names aren't Holmes and Watson, but still.
You may not know Grover Ogden, but he seems to know a lot about you.
I'm not paying your guys to sit around, Vince.
What's the holdup?
Couldn't get the chipper going when we got here.
I think it's jammed.
It was fine yesterday.
Repair guy's on his way.
How long are we talking?
Um, hour.
Maybe two?
I got ten more plots to clear before I can stop pouring foundations.
Where's the jam?
Probably somewhere between the drum and the cutter knives.
I got it!
Start it up.
Whoa!
Shut it down!
Right now!
What now?
- Look.

Believe it or not, this used to be an FBI agent.
Or, at least, that's what the badge says.
Lab is running the DNA to make sure.
Special Agent Robert Underhill, retired.
His car was found about 200 yards from the scene.
I reached out to the Bureau's New York office;
they're standing by to help, but... since Underhill was officially a civilian, it's our case.
No Joan today?
She's going to join us later.
So what else do we know about Special Agent Underhill?
An exemplary 34-year career, well-liked by his colleagues.
He and his wife Sheila moved to Kauai, 2012.
They moved back to New York about seven months ago.
Well, assuming this is Special Agent Underhill, he would've been dead before he went into the wood chipper.
The killer would've had to dismember him in order to get him through the infeed chute.
Right, so CSU examined all the chain saws that were used at the site, and found one with some blood between the teeth.
They think someone used it and then cleaned it last night.
Oleoresin capsicum.
More commonly known as... pepper spray.
We should alert the M.E. that this bag contains at least part of the face.
I'm sure he'll appreciate that.
So the bootprint found next to his car suggests he drove there himself.
Pepper spray, it's a close-range weapon.
Whoever deployed it would have had to have been close to him.
You think he was invited to the scene, knew his attacker.
The agent was a large man-- at least 220 pounds.
So if I was going to turn him into pulp,
I'd want him as close to that wood chipper as possible.
You said his wife's name was Sheila?
Mm.
We should talk to her, see if she knows her way around a chain saw.
What makes you think she did this?
Well, his personal effects are here.
I see the remains of a wallet, watch... there's no wedding ring.
And this bag, amongst the skin and bones, has flecks of latex and foil.
Looks like he was carrying at least one wrapped condom with him.
So he may not have been ready for a fight, but... he was ready for fun.
Bob wasn't cheating on me.
At least, not with another woman.
The only affair he ever had was with his job.
It was our understanding your husband retired in 2012.
He did.
We sold our house and moved to Kauai.
Then he got restless.
Missed his work, missed the city.
I could tell he wasn't happy, so I agreed to move back.
Respectfully,
Mrs. Underhill, we found evidence that he may have still been restless:
the remains of two unused prophylactics.
We separated six months ago.
It was amicable.
We stayed in touch.
So you separated but didn't divorce.
I'm guessing that means you're still his primary beneficiary.
You'd have been entitled to his pension, his life insurance...
I had dinner at my daughter's house in New Jersey last night.
Drank half a bottle of rosé, spent the night in the guest room.
Can anyone other than your daughter confirm that?
I took a train back to the city this morning.
There should be a record of my ticket purchase and... security footage from stations.
All right, we'll look into it.
In the meantime, can you think of anyone who would've wanted to hurt your husband?
After we moved back to New York,
Bob started looking into some of his old cases.
Ones that he never solved.
He asked a friend at the Bureau for copies of a bunch of files.
The last time we spoke, he said he thought one of those cases was finally going to crack.
He was closing in on someone.
Who?
I don't know.
Out of respect, he kept shop talk to a minimum after we separated.
But I'm sure if you go to his apartment, you'll find all the files.
They may tell you everything you need to know.
Joanie.
My gosh.
It's been months.
You look beautiful.
Thanks, Dad.
Or should I call you Grover Ogden?
What were you thinking?
I was honoring you.
The choices you make, the work you do.
I think it's wonderful.
Really?
So that's why you didn't ask my permission.
That's why you used a pseudonym.
Because you knew how honored I would be.
Did you even read the book?
Of course I read the book.
And?
It's ridiculous.
Sherlock and I do not run around with guns and we don't get into kung fu fights with criminals and we sure as hell do not sleep together.
Well, sex sells, Joanie.
You know that.
So how did you know that that was me?
Grover Ogden?
We lived on Ogden Avenue.
Grover was our dog.
And by the way, that is how you make a porn name, not a pen name!
Okay, look, I owed my publishers a book.
I was blocked.
I've never been blocked like this before.
I was going crazy.
So your mother comes home from seeing you in the city, and she tells me about this case you're working on, so...
Did she know about this?
No.
I'm just telling you how it all happened.
I don't care how it happened.
I just want it to go away.
Well, what does that mean?
The Heart Bled Blue didn't get the e-book treatment, which is good, for both of us, because I spent almost $4,000 last night trying to find all the hard copies I could find online.
You're gonna contact your publisher and you're gonna track down the rest.
You can't be serious.
Did Sherlock read the book?
What does that have to do with anything?
Well, you gave your opinion.
I'd like to know his.
Okay, first, you are not friends.
You met him once, at Aunt Vivian's funeral.
Second, he is never gonna find out about this.
He is the most private person that I know.
He would freak if he found out.
Call your publisher, Dad.
I mean it.
Typically, I'm averse to color coordination, but I dare say it brightens the place up.
What is all this?
The case files of the late Bob Underhill.
You got my texts?
Murdered FBI agent fed through a wood chipper.
His wife thought it was over one of his unsolved cases.
Marcus and I went to his apartment and discovered he had been revisiting three of them.
I made copies of his files and assigned each case its own room.
As you can see, the library tells the tale of a hate crime, a church burnt to the ground in 1981.
The arsonist, never identified.
You think that's who killed Underhill?
I do not.
Thanks in no small part to the late agent's meticulous notes,
I identified the guilty party.
He died in 1982.
This case took longer to solve, but not much.
Two-man bank robbery from 1997.
As it turns out, both parties went to jail for unrelated crimes in the early aughts.
Both parties remain incarcerated, so they're not our killers either.
Finally, the case of a serial poisoner who took six lives between 2008 and 2012.
I realized that the culprit was, in fact, the brother of one of Underhill's original suspects.
The only problem, he's in the Navy and he was on an aircraft carrier in the Arabian Sea last night.
So you took the three cases this guy couldn't crack over an entire career and you solved them in a few hours.
Bad news is his wife was wrong.
Underhill's old cases had nothing to do with his murder.
Actually, I think one of them did.
I asked the captain to find out if Underhill had requested any other case files, and it turns out he had.
Mina Davenport.
Oh, you're familiar with the case?
Of course.
She was kidnapped in 2004.
The guy who took her kept her in a basement.
Ten years later, she escaped and came home-- it was a huge story.
Are you saying that Underhill worked her abduction in '04?
He did.
And again in 2015.
He asked for and received copies of her case file just a few months ago.
Curious, then, that they were not amongst his many other materials.
Well, Mina's kidnapper was never found.
You think that's who Underhill was closing in on?
I think the absence of the files the agent requested is very suspicious.
Perhaps the killer removed them from his person last night.
Perhaps, post-mulching, he used his keys to access his apartment.
Either way, it could mean that Mina's abductor committed a murder less than 20 miles from her home last night.
It's hard to explain, losing your only child when she's ten, and then getting her back at 20.
People tend to think about the ten years you lost, but we could only think about the future;
all the time we were gonna have together after all.
It was a gift.
But we knew there was a catch, that the monster who had taken Mina was still out there.
Like I said, we can't be sure he's the one who killed Bob Underhill.
We wanted to know if you've seen anything out of the ordinary lately, any strange faces or vehicles?
No.
Nothing.
What about Mina?
If she had, she would've told us.
Is she here?
She's upstairs with her tutor.
She's working on her GED.
I mean, if it's all the same to you,
I'd rather not bring her into this.
If we're right, Mr. Davenport, she may be at the very center of it.
Well, if you're right.
If you're not, you could just upset her.
You could set her back months.
We've worked so hard to make her feel safe;
to help her find some peace.
After she first got away, she wouldn't let anyone touch her, not for weeks.
Now she'll let me hold her hand again.
She'll...
let me hug her.
What about Bob Underhill?
Had you heard from him lately?
I wish we had.
Uh...
Look, a... a-after this happened,
I-I, um...
I-I could hardly function.
I was the one who was supposed to pick Mina up from school that day;
I-I was the one who let the meeting run long, I...
I mean, it was my fault that she tried to walk home and, um when I could do nothing,
Agent Underhill did everything.
He was, uh... he was our rock.
We knew that Mina was able to help the FBI generate a sketch of her captor.
She even, uh, provided a first name:
Keith.
In the months since her return, has she remembered any other salient details?
Anything that might help us identify him?
I'm sorry.
No.
Mom...
Dad...
Is everything okay?
It's all right, sweetie.
We'll be done in here in just a minute.
Davenports may not have seen Keith around, but that doesn't mean we can't circulate his sketch.
Even if he didn't kill Underhill, he's still worth finding.
Assuming a figment of someone's imagination can be found.
What is that supposed to mean?
That man did not kill Agent Underhill, nor did he kidnap that young woman.
The description she gave is entirely fictional.
Hold up-- are you calling Mina Davenport a liar?
No, I'm calling that young girl a liar.
She's not Mina Davenport.
She's an imposter.
The old proverb says the eyes are the window to the soul.
In this case, it's the ears.
Note, in each image, the depth of the triangular fossa and the degree of attachment of the lobule.
These are the ears of two different people.
They don't look that different to me.
Watson?
He's right.
The architecture of the second ear is all wrong.
Mina Davenport disappeared when she was ten years old.
She grew; she changed.
Her body changed.
But not her ears.
They grow as kids get older, but they don't change shape.
Basically, this girl could not have grown up to become this girl.
We no longer think that Agent Underhill was onto Mina Davenport's abductor.
We believe he was onto her imposter.
Because of ears.
Six months ago, the first pictures of Miracle Mina were released by her family to the press.
Two weeks later, Agent Underhill requested copies of any and all files pertaining to her disappearance in 2004.
Now, perhaps he noticed the same discrepancy I did.
Perhaps it was something else.
Either way, I believe that he suspected this girl had taken the place of the real Mina.
Presumably to avail herself of the Davenports' vast wealth.
The girl you're saying isn't Mina, she passed a DNA test.
Tell me that wasn't in Underhill's files?
It was.
Her DNA was a perfect match for the sample taken from Mina's toothbrush in 2004.
Funny thing about that toothbrush.
It disappeared around the same time as the test.
The private lab which compared the two samples chalked it up to human error.
We think the imposter had an accomplice, someone inside the lab who made sure to test her DNA against itself and then got rid of the toothbrush to prevent future tests.
Frankly, Captain, I'm surprised you don't find our thesis more compelling.
I find it compelling as hell, but I also think I'm the only parent in the room.
You know your kids.
I don't care if they're gone ten years or 50.
You know them.
How many of your children have been kidnapped?
I'm merely pointing out that these parents could hardly be blamed for falling prey to a charlatan.
They dreamt of their daughter's safe return for over a decade.
We want to invite them in, break the news to them as gently as possible.
All they have to do is let us take a DNA sample from them, and then we can compare that to the samples taken from the imposter in 2014.
Those, the lab does still have.
They'll prove that she isn't who she says she is.
At the very least, Captain, the Davenports deserve to know whether they have a killer living under their roof.
Mr. Davenport...
thanks for coming.
Yeah.
Of course.
You said you had news.
We do, but... we thought your wife was joining.
Yeah.
She's just right there.
Oh, you brought Mina.
Yeah, well, after you left last night, she just kept asking questions about you and... she knows something's up, so Nancy and I... well, we told her the truth.
She was... very brave.
She, uh, said she wanted to know everything.
Mina... this is Detective Bell.
This is Ms. Watson and Mr. Holmes.
Actually, Mina, we were hoping to talk to your parents alone.
Oh.
Whatever you have to say,
I can hear it.
I never met Agent Underhill, but I know how much he did for my mom and dad.
I want to help.
It was my birthday that week.
Not my real birthday;
the one he'd given me.
Keith.
It was the one time of year he was actually nice to me.
It wasn't until later that I realized it was the anniversary of the day he took me.
We had just gotten back from a trip.
So this Keith-- he was, uh, he was a trucker and, uh, he kept you stashed in the back of his, uh, cab during long hauls.
I wasn't allowed to leave the truck, but...
I could look out the window sometimes.
I could see trees, cars... other people.
When I was in the basement, it was...
it was just me.
So, um, according to this file, uh, you-you never had any inkling, uh, what city or state
Keith's home was in.
Well, I was so young when he took me and I wasn't...
I wasn't allowed to watch any TV or look at a newspaper, ever.
The FBI people said that was because he needed me to be completely dependent on him.
It worked.
So you were saying it was the-the week of your birthday...
Keith said it was time.
We started thinking about having a family.
And I, and I couldn't stop thinking about that.
We were on the road.
Another trip.
I... waited until he fell asleep, and then...
I went into his bag.
And I took out the straight razor he used to shave and I held it right up to his neck.
But you didn't do it.
I don't know why,
I just couldn't.
I got out of the truck and I just ran and I didn't stop running until that morning.
And you were in, uh,
Lander, Pennsylvania.
I didn't know it at the time, but yes.
So then you, um, you shut yourself into a gas station restroom and you take out Keith's straight razor and you cut off all your hair.
Keith forced me to dye my hair blonde.
He had, ever since I was ten.
My therapist said I was reclaiming my old self, but... to be honest...
I don't even remember doing it.
I couldn't even tell you what I was thinking.
Well, what you were thinking is that you wanted to look as pathetic as possible when-when the police found you.
Yeah.
I...
You are one of the best liars
I have ever met, and that's saying something.
It's small wonder you've managed to fool the Davenports.
No, look, I'm sorry.
What?
I mean, they're still defending you right now.
Mr. Davenport...
They still believe you're their daughter, ...but we, of course, we know you are not.
Mina, we're leaving.
Dad-Daddy, what's going on?
Come on.
Right now.
It's okay, sweetie, you haven't done anything wrong.
Everything's gonna be okay.
Stay the hell away from my family!
Smells like something died in here.
I'd hardly expect elephant dung to smell like potpourri.
It is, in fact, a highly sought-after coffee, produced by feeding arabica beans to pachyderms in northern Thailand.
And it has the potential to further reduce my need for sleep.
Would you...?
No, thanks.
I had poop for lunch.
You should've seen the Davenports' faces when we broke the news to them.
I mean, I knew they'd take it hard, but I didn't think they'd refuse to give us their DNA.
We underestimated the hold the imposter has over them.
If they won't help prove she's a fraud, we'll just see if she killed Bob Underhill instead.
Yesterday you said you had to accompany your mother to a doctor's appointment in Scarsdale.
That's right.
Only you didn't.
You didn't even see her.
You saw your stepfather instead.
May I assume your visit had something to do with his book?
You know about the book?
An hour ago, I signed for a box which contained nearly 200 copies... but I've been aware of it for months.
An associate brought it to my attention.
You read it?
I did.
You're not mad?
Should I be?
Of course you should, you're you.
It's hardly the first time
I've inspired a writer, Watson.
I am actually the basis for several fictional characters across various media.
It's one of the by-products of my success as a detective.
I fascinate;
this cannot be helped.
You yourself once wrote about me:
The Casebook of Sherlock Holmes.
When did you...?
I was displeased because you used my real name and you shared my real history.
Your father's magnum opus, on the other hand, is the very opposite of real.
Look no further than chapter 32, where we make love beneath a footbridge in Central Park.
Why didn't you tell me about it?
The book, not chapter 32.
Your stepfather uses pseudonym, and I assumed you were the reason for that.
You seem angrier than I'd expected.
May I ask why?
Are you expecting someone?
I got your address off the card you left with my parents.
You mean, your marks.
They think I'm at my tutor's right now.
Can I come in?
I'm not sure you should.
There's no wood chipper in here.
Uh... you can frisk me.
Whatever you want.
I...
I just want to talk.
You're right about a lot of things.
But you're wrong about others.
You admit you're not Mina Davenport.
I do.
But I didn't kill that FBI guy.
And why should we believe you?
Because I can tell you who did.
Richard and Nancy.
The Davenports?
And why, pray tell, would they murder the man who worked so hard to find their daughter?
Because... he was about to figure out their secret.
No one took Mina.
They killed her.
My real name is Cassie, but you can call me Mina, if it's easier.
I'm used to it.
You have a second name?
For the purpose of this conversation, no.
There's a reason I came to talk to you and not the police.
Do tell.
Mina turns 21 in a couple of weeks.
Or, at least she would have.
When that happens, I get access to her trust.
There's almost five million in it.
If you keep my secret until then,
I'll tell you everything.
I'll even be your eyes and ears inside the house.
You... you think I'm lying again.
Why would we not?
A couple of years ago, I came across this magazine article.
It was the anniversary of Mina's disappearance, and they did this computer thing to show what she would look like if she were still alive.
I realized I looked like her.
Not a lot, but enough.
I thought if I studied the case, if I learned everything I could about her,
I could fool people.
Because you'd run cons before?
Nothing like this.
This was big.
I had to trick Mina's own parents.
So you came up with a story that would allow for the occasional trip-up.
You were abused, locked in a basement, you forgot your old life;
that way, no one would be suspicious when you had trouble remembering things the real Mina would have known.
My favorite wrinkle was Keith's truck.
You said you'd escaped from it, as opposed to the house, because, like Keith, the house didn't exist, and you didn't have to worry about leading anyone back to it.
I was never worried about fooling the police or the FBI.
Just Richard and Nancy.
I had this whole script ready, things I would say or do, if I thought they were getting suspicious.
Only...
I never needed it.
They treated me like their daughter from the second I met them.
At first I thought I was just that good.
But a couple months ago, something happened.
I, um...
I woke up in the middle of the night and...
Richard was sitting there.
He touched my arm.
He said this was something he and Mina used to do.
He said, "You are my little girl, aren't you?"
You get it, right?
He knew I wasn't her because he'd killed her.
He was abusing her.
She must have threatened to tell someone and...
You said Nancy was involved, too.
No one worked harder to teach me about Mina's old life.
She needed to make sure no one else knew
I wasn't really her daughter.
Because that would guarantee no one would uncover Richard's crime.
He lied to you the other night.
The FBI guy had come to the house.
I saw them arguing in the driveway that night.
I didn't know who he was, so I didn't think much of it at the time, but then, when you guys came to the house, I...
He figured me out.
He must have.
So Richard killed him.
Two weeks-- that's all I need.
You keep all of this between us... and I'll help you get justice for Mina.
Deal.
These are listening devices.
Bugs.
I need you to plant one on the first floor of the Davenports' home and one on the second.
This one's sort of big.
It's imperative you put both of them near windows.
This will make it easier for us to pick up and record their conversations.
Have I made myself clear?
Yeah.
So why are you still here?
I know I did something terrible.
But Richard and Nancy did something worse.
You won't regret this, I promise.
You're almost as good of a liar as she is.
She actually thinks you believe her.
She's obviously attempting to divert attention until she can claim Mina's trust money and disappear.
Then why did you just give her two bugs?
You know she's not gonna say anything incriminating when she's around them.
Actually, Watson, only one of them is a bug.
The other is a flash bang.
You gave her a bomb?
It's a very small bomb with a very big bang.
Tomorrow morning, I will activate the listening device, and when I'm certain all three family members are on one floor,
I'll detonate the flash bang on the other.
If they don't call the police themselves, one of their neighbors will.
And then we can poke around their house without a warrant and collect all the DNA we want.
The Davenports aren't gonna trust any test results from us, not after today.
As I said earlier, I'm only interested in whether our imposter killed Bob Underhill.
His murder was especially violent.
She would have been covered in his blood.
If she carried any trace of it back to the house, we'll have her, no matter who the Davenports think she is.
I thought you said it was a small bomb.
No, no!
No, you people are not coming into my home!
Mr. Davenport, we are here to help you, believe it or not.
Oh, like hell you are.
Mr. Davenport, I understand you're not happy to see any of us, but when a bomb goes off on your property, you don't get to pick and choose who investigates.
May we assume the explosive device was not yours, Mr. Davenport?
Of course it wasn't.
Well, then, you have our word we will not rest until the guilty party has been identified.
So, uh...
Hey, I checked the security system.
It was enabled, but it wasn't tripped.
No signs that anyone broke in to plant the device.
Got to be the girl, right?
What are the chances of this happening one day after we accuse her of running a con?
Yeah, but the upside?
She gets to play the victim card again?
Whatever her reasons were, we should be glad.
We have all morning to look for proof she killed Underhill.
That was a bust, too.
Her bedroom and bathroom were spotless.
Nothing in the drains, the carpet or the hamper.
Kitchen and, uh, laundry room were equally clean, but let's not forget the obscenity of the Davenports' wealth.
By my count, we still have ten rooms to go.
All right, let's check out CSU, and see how they're doing.
It's because he cheated on my mother.
My stepfather.
You asked me yesterday why I was so angry about the book.
Yes, I remember, and I recall the affair, but what one has to do with the other...?
He was always a free spirit, adventurous, did what he wanted when he wanted.
I loved that about him.
Until what he wanted was something other than Mary.
It wasn't even serious.
Just some woman he met at a book signing, back when he was still putting his name on his own work.
And then my mother found out.
Well, she's a proud woman.
I'm sure it was difficult.
Well, things weren't the same after that.
She and my father patched things up, but I don't know.
I guess I kept him at arm's length.
And then, when he wrote that book, it was like he was thinking about himself again.
Speaking of people who think they can get away with things, look at the seat.
Note how close it is to the pedals.
This has been adjusted for somebody short, not Richard Davenport, who by my estimation is six foot tall.
Nancy, meanwhile, drives this SUV.
I know 'cause I saw her keys at the station yesterday.
So you think this is the car the imposter drives.
Look at the brake pedal.
Blood.
Agent Underhill's, I presume, transferred from the bottom of his killer's shoe.
Dad, what are you doing here?
Well, I have something for you, and I thought I'd drop it off in person.
Come in.
Wow.
Really love what you've done with this place.
I'll tell Sherlock.
I'm sure he can do the same for you and Mom.
Is he around?
No, he's at the precinct.
Uh, we're waiting to hear about some blood that we found.
Oh, that sounds exciting.
So did you talk to your publisher?
Hey, the wheels are in motion.
I don't know the ins and the outs, but suffice it to say that The Heart Bled Blue is about to become very difficult to find.
I appreciate that.
Mm-hmm.
What's this?
Uh, that's the sequel.
You wrote another book based on me and Sherlock?
Wait-- before you take my head off, I already told the editor that he can't have it;
it's all yours.
I was just putting the finishing touches on it when you came by the house the other day.
I don't understand.
Is this for me to burn?
That's for you to do with whatever you like.
I missed you, Joanie, and that's the real reason
I wrote about you.
I mean, these last few years, ever since I... strayed...
You know, I know that I screwed up.
I knew it the moment that it happened.
But what I didn't know, what I wasn't ready for, was what it would do to us.
You used to be my friend.
And I ruined that.
The book is just my way of dealing with it.
It let me be close to you again.
Hmm.
No rest for the weary.
Dad, just... just hold on, okay?
Hello?
The blood on the brake pedal came from Bob Underhill.
I didn't think we'd hear back from the lab this quickly.
We didn't hear back from the lab.
We heard from Richard Davenport.
He's here, and he claims he killed Underhill, and he wants to confess.
Oh, she's told him a sob story.
She must have.
Something along the lines of, "The mean FBI man confronted me,
"accused me of all the things the police did.
I was frightened, I snapped."
He's still utterly convinced she's his daughter.
She knew he blamed himself for what happened to the real Mina.
In 2004, he couldn't save her.
In 2015, he can.
Well, however she did it, she's forcing our hand.
We either got to charge him or find some way of proving that he's covering for her.
I think the choice is clear.
Mina, or whatever her name is, in a rush to escape a murder charge, has made a mistake.
Accept the false confession and book Richard Davenport.
That will make it easier to obtain a sample of his DNA.
We can compare it to the samples that were taken from the imposter when she turned up last year.
We can show him the results.
There you go.
I'm not sure that would have been enough to convince him, but now, staring down the barrel of life in prison, we might be able to get him to see the light.
The DNA was a match?
This can't be right.
All I can tell you is what the lab told me.
The girl's DNA is a familial match to Richard Davenport.
According to the report, she's his daughter.
It's the same results as the original report that matched her to Mina's toothbrush.
Now, I know you thought she had an accomplice, someone on the inside.
This test was done in-house.
We put a rush on it.
There is no way she could have effected the results.
Then someone made a mistake.
The girl that we're dealing with is not Mina Davenport.
Her genetic material says otherwise.
What about her ears?
It doesn't trump a DNA test.
It says there that Richard Davenport's DNA was compared to a sample of the imposter's hair.
That's right.
Wouldn't it have been standard procedure to take a cheek swab when she was oh-so-miraculously found 14 months ago?
It would, but the FBI said she was in such a feral state, she wouldn't let anyone near her.
So they bagged the hair that she had cut off in the gas station bathroom.
Maybe she's not Mina, but she is Davenport's daughter.
Well, say he had an affair.
The girl was born out of wedlock.
She pretended to be Mina to mess with him, get everything she thought she deserved.
Well, that would actually explain a lot.
No.
Respectfully, Detective, I don't like that theory.
That's a bad theory.
Why is it a bad theory?
'Cause it wouldn't account for Mina, the real Mina, and what happened to her in 2004.
It's not supposed to.
It's supposed to explain how a girl we think is a fraud passed a DNA test.
I've got a different theory-- better one.
I mean, I-I prefer it.
Trust me when I say that you will, too.
Mrs. Davenport, thank you so much for coming.
This is my attorney,
Mr. O'Donnell.
Earlier today, the woman that you know as your daughter...
She is my daughter.
She passed a DNA test, or at least a strand of her hair did.
It was a familial match for a cheek swab taken from your husband.
The thing is, that hair did not come directly from Mina's head.
It was one of the hairs that she claimed she cut off with a straight razor the day she was found.
Claimed?
This was the second test she passed.
We were suspicious of the test she took 14 months ago, because Mina's toothbrush, the source of the comparison sample-- disappeared.
But then, this morning, when the results of the second test arrived, we wondered what if the loss of the toothbrush really was human error?
What if she had passed both tests because the hair that was examined really did come from Mina?
You're not making any sense.
Please.
It occurred to me that if someone had access to Mina's hair 14 months ago, then they also had access to Mina...
It was hard to imagine a woman allowing someone to take a straight razor to her head willingly.
So we reached out to law enforcement across the country.
We found a report of an assault in Sturbridge, Massachusetts, where a young woman wearing a mask attacked another young woman and shaved her head.
Not the kind of crime you see every day.
Even more remarkable-- the assault was perpetrated just two days... before the imposter was found in Lander, Pennsylvania.
She'd located Mina, you see.
And instead of reporting it to the authorities, she took her hair.
She then scattered that around in Pennsylvania as if it was her own.
The victim of the Sturbridge attack gave a fake name at the hospital.
She was signed out by a man named Norman Ott.
Mr. Ott, it turns out, lived near Mina's school in 2004.
His apartment was on a route she would've taken home.
It's really her, Nancy.
It's really Mina.
It...
No.
I...
It can't...
When the police paid a visit to Mr. Ott's home in Sturbridge today;
he wasn't home, but Mina was.
Over the years, he told different stories about her.
Some people thought she was his daughter.
Others thought she was his wife.
The only thing we know for sure is that she was allowed to leave the house sometimes.
That's how the imposter was able to gain access to her.
You can imagine she's been through quite an ordeal, but she remembers you and Richard, and she's been asking for you.
So as soon as he's recanted his confession, he'll be brought here.
Would you like me to take you to see her?
Hi.
Joanie, what are you...?
I'm sorry I got so angry about the book.
Oh, you don't have anything to apologize for.
Come in.
Well, I've changed my mind.
I'm okay with it being out there, so whatever you told your publishers to do, you can tell them to stop.
It's all right.
You're sure?
I read the sequel.
I actually think it's better than the first.
Yeah.
A-And you...
you made some notes.
Just a few.
I thought we could spend some time and talk about them.
Well... it would be an honor.

Mind if I call you Cassie?
I'd call you by your real name, but you're refusing to give it.
Cassie is fine.
Sorry I missed your arrest and booking, but I've been coordinating the effort to identify you.
To my great surprise, your fingerprints weren't in AFIS.
Of course they aren't.
I've never committed any crimes.
You've never been caught.
Is there a difference?
So how old are you?
Really?
Fifteen.
No, wait.
Twenty-five.
Or maybe it's some other number.
My colleagues showed your photograph to Mina Davenport.
She says she's never seen you before.
You're also a stranger to Norman Ott.
He was taken into custody yesterday.
Who?
He wasn't lying when he said he never met you before.
I could tell.
Would you at least concede you spent some time in Sturbridge?
How else would you know about Mina's situation?
I've been to lots of places.
Have you enjoyed them?
'Cause your time of coming and going is now squarely in the past.
You think I killed that FBI agent, but... you don't have a murder weapon, just some blood in a car.
I've already come up with six different ways to explain it.
Tell me one.
Um...
I hope you come to my trial.
Should be fun.
Think you can lie your way out?
I do.
Now tell me... am I lying?

I often think about that day.
Although it's been almost a year now.
But it would be difficult not to think.
Indeed, in fact, that day my whole life turned upside down.
Get up!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Lucas, stop it.
One.
Two.
Three!
Let go.
But Mom.
Well...
No.
Five minutes.
I hardly slept.
I was finishing my work.
Get up!
- Lucas.
- Get up!
Get up.
And what?
You got up, got up!
- Are you awake, huh?
- Yes, yes.
Well, you see, we're going.
Vacation, mother.
Slow down.
Wait.
Hello, Mrs. Cybulski.
We are leaving.
And why so early?
- We can not wait.
- Bye.
- Mrs. Cybulski, will you water the flowers?
- I'll water, I'll water.
Here it is.
Hey guy!
I have something for you.
- Everything that is harmful.
- Thank you.
Holidays, so vacations.
Right?
BEHIND THE BLUE DOOR After 200 meters turn right.
As the distinguished Mrs. wishes.
Lucas, will we play puzzles?
- Puzzles, Mom?
Really?
- Really.
- Well, all right.
I'm starting.
- Wait a minute.
Girls need to go first.
Long, flat, and on it you can swim.
- Kayak?
- No.
- Canoe!
- No.
- Flat.
- Pontoon?
No.
Surfboard?
And I forgot - it has a sail.
Mother, this board?
Yes.
I paid you lessons from tomorrow.
Wow!
It's all right.
It hurts.
You need to be manly...
Your knee is shattered.
You have a very complicated operation.
Where's Mom?
Mom ... we moved to another hospital.
Why?
Well, you see...
Mom fell into a coma.
What does it mean?
It means that she is sound asleep and we can not wake her up now.
I can.
If they let her in.
Now you need to rest.
Does it hurt?
No.
Still bending or not?
Still bending.
We are working.
Lucas.
I know that you want to get out of here.
But everything has its time.
When Mom wakes up,
I will definitely tell you.
We'll go get some clothes from your apartment.
Why is that?
Well, because, you will live with me.
But I have my own house.
But you can not live alone.
Come on, dear.
You'll be fine with me.
Come on.
I can not stay for long, here is the entrance for the ambulance.
Wait a minute!
Mrs. Cybulski,
Yes?
Could we stop by my mom?
I beg you.
Can I go to her?
Mom.
Get up.
I want to go home.
Do you hear me?
Really?
I'm sorry that I've been away so long.
You're not fooling me.
One.
Two.
Three.
Your mother needs rest.
Come on.
Come, let's go.
Mrs. Cybulski.
Lucas, is that you?
I got the mail.
You do not have to walk the stairs alone.
I know, but ...
Couldn't we go to my mom and read it to her?
It's from the bank.
From the bank?
What?
They write that the next payment has not arrived.
If your mother does not come out of the coma...
She will.
Of course, yes.
She will.
But...
What then?
They will take our apartment from us?
It could happen.
Mom will pay this fee.
Surely.
I'll open it.
No, I will.
I need to train my leg.
Are you Lucas Bursky?
Yes.
Good.
Get ready.
Come with me.
...You do not mind that the mother must give her consent.
She never told me that...
I will not explain to you our family problems.
In any case, we are close relatives.
But maybe it would be better to contact his...
Careful, you!
I am not "you".
If you did not eavesdrop, nothing would happen.
You talked about me?
Not only you.
Can you tell me what's going on here?
Mrs. Agatha is your relative.
Aunt.
Aunt.
What?
I'm your mom's sister.
- I do not believe it.
Mom never said that she has a sister.
- Maybe she did not want to tell you.
- Mom told me everything about everything!
- Lucas, not in that tone.
- But, she's a fraud!
- Listen, you shithead.
I, too, do not like this whole situation.
But if you continue to behave this way, it will be even more difficult for us.
Do you understand?
I ask you, why so nervous?
Excuse me.
I have something here...
Maybe it will convince you.
I need to sit down.
Did mom have a braid?
We both did.
Fashion was like that.
Interesting.
I'm sorry I shouted.
I'm also sorry.
I do not know how to talk with children.
I'm not a child.
And this?
What?
This?
My "High Coast".
That is?
My boarding house.
You'll see tomorrow.
But I do not want to go there.
Do you think I'm going to study here in Warsaw?
But I can not leave my mother.
I talked to the doctor.
Tomorrow we leave.
In the morning.
Come on.
It looks like a coffin on wheels.
Jump in.
Maybe you forgot to put in gas?
Aunt?
Do not exaggerate.
It's a very good machine.
Old but vigorous.
I've had it since 1989...
Well, what a champ.
Maybe she is not so fast, but she's enough.
For what?
For everything.
Well, you know, I do everything myself.
Sometimes people need to bring guests.
When will we be back?
I need her.
We drive.
We're here.
It should be open.
Well, let's go.
Come on, I'll make you something to eat.
Omelette.
Suitable?
Well, let's go, let's go.
When the water boils, brew yourself a tea.
I'll be right back.
Are you finished?
I prepared for you your mother's former room.
But, unfortunately, it is on the top floor.
Therefore, you'd better spend the night here at the bottom.
I want my mom's room.
- The stairs are steep.
- It's nothing.
I want my mom's room.
Well, all right.
Come on.
Yes...
And the most important rule of the "High Coast".
Always knock.
I do not understand.
Whenever you want to go somewhere, always knock.
Well, and the "first rule".
Repeat, because this is very important.
Always knock.
Why?
In order to not disturb the guests.
It's here.
And why is it blue?
Your mother painted it so.
She was always slightly abnormal.
It's beautiful.
Well, I do not know about that.
I like it.
Breakfast at eight thirty.
Do not be late.
Good night.
Good night.
"This is the phone of Magdalena Bursky.
Leave a message after the signal."
"This is the phone of Magdalena Bursky.
Leave a message after the signal."
Hello.
Why the fuss?
For you cooked in the kitchen.
Let the guests eat in peace.
Do you need a special invitation?
Hey, look.
Get out of the road!
Fuck, I'm bleeding!
Hey, did not you hear me screaming?
- I heard.
- So why did not you move?
I thought you could drive.
Learn to walk by yourself.
Cripple!
- Fatty!
- Lucas.
- We're riding around, Agatha.
- Let's go!
- I'll get you!
Everything okay?
What did they want?
Nothing.
I'll figure it out myself.
Lucas.
- Lucas.
- I do not want to be here.
- Listen...
- I do not want to listen either.
Do not talk like that.
Leave me alone.
I hate this place.
Is it because of those kids?
Because of everything.
Because of you, too.
Take me home.
I can not.
I have something for you.
It belonged to your father.
I do not want to talk about anything.
Go away.
Do you think I wanted this?
At my age to deal with children?
Was Dad from here?
No.
He came for the summer, to work.
He was in love with your mother, and she with him.
And that's it.
What is it?
Your dad was gone, the night before the wedding.
- How was he gone?
- Just disappeared.
It was generally a nightmare.
The storm raged on the sea.
At the entrance to our bay, a boat crashed against the rocks.
Even here, screams were heard.
- Did everyone die?
- No.
Four of them immediately swam to the shore.
The fifth, the last, was found in the morning.
It seems that when he tried to escape, he became entangled in the rope.
He hit his head and lost consciousness.
Actually, he still can not say how he got on the beach.
You can imagine what kind of hell it was, turmoil.
Well, in the morning it turned out that your father was nowhere to be found.
Your mother...
My God!
Your mother then greatly grieved.
She told me that he was a coward.
He was afraid of responsibility.
She was mortally offended at him.
He packed up and left the "High Coast".
And she never came back here again.
- Hey, be careful!
- Can I have it?
- No way.
- But Aunt!
Please.
I'll be careful.
I promise.
Well, okay.
But, be careful.
Aunt,
I'm sorry for what I did earlier.
It's okay.
I'll go to the kitchen.
Dinner won't cook itself.
- Neurology.
I'm listening.
- Hello?
This is Lucas Bursky.
Has my mother come out of the coma yet?
I got him!
Did you see it?
The first time!
Sorry, I'll call tomorrow.
- On the fourth.
- Shut up.
- What do you want?
- Nothing.
- It's boring to us.
- I do not care.
Let's see what you say when you live here longer.
I do not have to live here at all, I can leave when I want.
Well, of course.
Panove, put everything down.
This is my stuff.
Mine and my mom.
Lucas, I had to do it.
The bank took away your apartment.
Why did not you tell me before?
Lucas!
Lucas!
Lucas, please.
Leave me alone!
Lucas, open up for me.
We will talk.
No!
- Open up, you shithead!
- I do not want to.
Please leave, and then you'll see!
Open it.
What are you doing?
You're a thief!
Mom will never forgive you for this.
I'll bring another key!
Lucas!
To you too!
Do you understand?
You, the "High Coast", and these stupid rules about knocking.
Lucas, stop it!
Aunt?
Are you there?
Aunt.
Come back.
Lucas.
What are you doing?
Me?
I'm knocking.
What for?
Because, you told me.
Yes, but everyone left.
But you're here.
And you thought I was sitting in the broom pantry?
You somehow follow the rules strangely.
You know?
I'm sorry.
In general, I do not know.
Maybe that's normal at your age.
I'll go upstairs.
My leg hurts.
Monster!
Where are you?
Monster.
Where are you?
Wow!
Post Office?
Tools?
Tailor?
It's strange.
Mannequin...
Who is there?
I'm glad you looked.
Lucas.
Lucas.
- Mother.
- I love you.
Lucas!
Do not be afraid.
Who are you?
Where am I?
Where have you been?
I went through the door.
The door?
In the "High Coast" there is a door.
The blue one.
I went through it.
I have to go.
You, fuck off!
From me?
Well, the truth.
I have to go.
Well, no.
Aunt will be worried.
Aunt?
Yes, Aunt.
She is from the majority?
I do not understand.
Is she from your world or from the majority?
Huh?
From the majority?
Of people?
It's full.
More precisely, billions.
People are everywhere.
Now you do not have to ...
... someone told you.
- Someone?
- ANOTHER someone.
- Billions.
- Well, I'm going.
And I'm alone!
Do you have any desire?
If this stupid knee no longer hurt.
What are you doing?
What are you up to?
Let go!
It does not hurt.
Thank you.
Do not thank me.
I have done something for you, and you will do something for me.
What?
A trifle.
A little thing.
I want you to take something with you.
What?
A nodule for memory.
Give me your hand.
So that you do not forget.
About the poor old Pomer.
I certainly will not forget you.
Bye.
If possible, come back.
Come back.
300 meters straight.
120 meters straight.
Turn right.
50 meters straight.
Turn around.
Turn left.
50 meters straight.
After 20 meters turn left.
70 meters straight.
You got to the goal.
You got to the goal.
Thank you for sharing the journey.
Thank you for sharing the journey.
Thank you.
Without you, I would not have done it.
I have something for you.
Chick, chick, chick.
Kitty, kitty?
Monster.
Not that.
Take the cookies.
- Well, you're it!
- Come back.
- What are you doing?
- If you can, come back.
Stupid bird.
Yes, Aunt.
I am now.
I'll be right there.
Where have you been?
- I was walking.
- At this time?
It happened.
- Do you know what I went through?
- I'm sorry.
- Why did you not take your phone?
- Calm down.
- Calm down?
- Do not shout, Aunt.
I'm not shouting!
I was worried about you.
Next time, tell me where you're going.
Understood.
Good.
Let's go and eat something.
Aunt?
Lucas.
Would you like to eat?
You okay?
Leave me alone.
Do you have a date with this wounded man, sis?
- I did not know you were like that.
- We will survive.
Do you not see that something happened to him?
Moron.
Not with me, with my aunt.
I did something terrible to my aunt.
Have you killed your own aunt?
No.
This is Pomtnaya.
He did something to her.
- The tailor?
- Pomtnaya.
He is from another world.
There are no other worlds.
He fools us.
Shut up, you see, he's not faking.
Please, help me!
It looks strange, guys.
I will not go there in my life.
We're getting out of here.
- Well, then, brother, you stay.
- Alone?
Are you crazy?
It's dark here.
I do not like it here.
It's a cesspool.
You are here at least occasionally to clean up?
What is it?
Aunt?
Good thing you brought guests.
I really love guests.
Do you want something to eat?
I do.
There!
What is it?
What kind of disease is that?
This is a kind of mutation.
But because of what?
I told you.
You probably do not have everything at home.
Let's add more.
Quickly!
Lucas, it's your aunt, do something.
Flee through the window.
Oh no!
Not so.
Step away.
Guys, help!
Hurry up!
Quickly.
She's going to smash everything.
Lucas, I'm afraid.
We pull at the count of "three".
One, two, three.
Save yourself!
There!
- Move, I do not fit.
- Where?
She wants to kill us.
That's not her.
Then who's chasing us wise guy?
She's not to blame.
She got infected.
She needs to go to the hospital.
It does not look like a disease that can be treated.
I think it's her head.
Not true.
There is nothing to help.
I told you, it's because of Pomtnaya.
He infected her.
She is not from this world.
What do we do with it?
This is not our business.
We have no idea at all.
And we're lost here for nothing.
It is gone.
Are you sure?
Well, it seems so.
Come on.
Let's go there.
Lucas, take this.
Thank you.
- I do not want to go there.
- Come on, come on.
Thank you.
Where to now?
Quiet!
Lucas, watch out!
Quickly.
To the blue door.
What am I doing here?
What am I doing here?
Phelka, quiet!
Oh no!
This is the end!
- Have you lost your mind?
- We're fucked?
Come on.
Look, it does not hurt again!
Well, super!
Do you know how to make magic?
Cosmos!
- I told you.
- Hey, are we going?
- Where?
- To kill Pomtnaya.
Well, no, I'm going back.
Excellent.
Say hi to Aunt.
What colors!
Yes, well, nonsense.
It's girly-some.
My mom would have liked it.
How long has your mother been in the hospital?
A long time.
She's in a coma.
She never regained consciousness after the accident.
But she will wake up.
And I would eat pizza now.
With what?
With anything.
With pineapple too?
- Ugh, I do not like vegetables.
- Pineapple is a fruit, buddy.
Hey, you, wait!
Yes, slow down.
What is it?
They are watching us.
What is it?
What does she want?
I do not know.
But I do not like it.
Here he lives.
In this museum?
Oh, there's a passage over there.
- They're coming for us!
- Shut up, Phelka!
What are we going to do?
Run!
Phelka!
Phelka, are you all right?
I dont know.
They didn't do anything to me?
Nothing.
Just ate the threads.
Are these threads edible?
We could not pass through the hedge, if they had not eaten it all.
Straight.
If I knew that you had cookies...
Quiet.
You'll spook her.
We need you.
- It's here.
- I do not want to go there.
Then you'll stay and watch the entrance.
You are crazy.
So that I stay here alone...
Enough already!
You got your whining.
Well, all right.
I'll stay with him then.
Come on.
Once you hurry up then we can find Agatha.
I'm back.
Waiting seems so long to me.
But I'm patient.
I have time.
What did you do with my aunt?
During her experience?
And now I'll take care of you, too.
Just try it!
Come on.
Come back, come back ...
Do you really think that I can be defeated?
And I thought that they would succeed.
If there were more of them, it would be possible.
We won't be able to pass through the hedge.
Look, there are tools over there.
Yet here it is.
Your dad's jacket.
Do you know my dad?
Oh yeah.
We met once.
Boat "WKL 39".
It was a beautiful night.
That night a storm broke out.
Four swam to shore.
The fifth was to be mine.
But...
Your dad...
Your father took from me what was to come to me.
Therefore, I had to punish him.
And now, I'll take care of you.
Lucas, help!
Lucas!
Lucas!
That's it?
No, not yet.
- Help!
...
- What is this?
...
Lucas!
I wonder what else she did to us ...?
Aunt?
Look, Lucas.
So beautiful...
Birds.
Mother.
Lucas?
- Are you here?
- I'm here.
Lucas!
Oh, my God ...
I'm always here with you.
You came out of the coma?
No, son.
It's you.
It's you who left the coma.
Miss, doctor.
Is this important?
I can not be distracted right now.
- He came out of the coma.
- I know.
Those three children, I was responsible for them.
No, Lucas came out of the coma.
- It can not be.
- Lucas.
My God!
It's a miracle!
Escape to the residency.
Mother.
There was such a big window and kitchen.
And the door of your room was blue.
When you were sleeping, I told you all about it.
Really?
About Dad, too?
Yes, about him too.
About how we met.
About every day when we were together, before he left.
But Mom, Dad did not leave.
He was on a boat then, saving a man.
Like a real hero.
Well, of course.
And my aunt?
Will we go to her?
My sister's...
She's been dead for a long time.
She died when you were little.
I told you about her, too.
Hello!
- Mrs. Cybulski!
- Hello.
My sweet.
My dear ones.
And I made you a delicious little...
Monya?
Monya.
Is it you?
Well, we are.
Who else?
What are you doing here?
We left the coma.
And you?
Stop fooling around, Zgryz.
How do you know my name?
- Do we know each other?
- Well, of course.
I'm Lucas, you're Monya.
And you are Phelka.
"High Coast"?
Pomtnaya?
Aunt Agatha?
- You do not remember?
- Yes, you have not come to your senses yet.
We are now celebrities.
The television will come to take pictures of us, but you will bear such nonsense, you will disgrace us all.
But this is not nonsense.
We learned about this in another world.
Hey, relax.
Nothing like the silvery world exists.
It is scientifically impossible.
You dreamed everything.
Enough for you, come on.
What's wrong with that?
Such strange birds, with fur and foil wings.
Wow.
Wings of foil.
Fuck off.
You're deranged.
- Well, all right.
- No, it's not.
- All right.
Let's play something?
- What?
The usual.
- Yes, you're already bored with this.
- Hey, new one, are you playing with us?
Beautiful.
We are now on vacation in the "High Coast".
Every day we go for walks, we talk and laugh a lot.
Everyone around me says that all the months that I spent in the hospital,
I was lying in bed and in a coma.
"WKL 39..."
Maybe so.
But I do not believe that this is the whole truth.
Mom seems to believe my story.
But I think that, like other people, she is afraid of something she can not understand.
Dad.
Mom!
So I decided not to say more about the world behind the blue door.
I do not want my mother to be afraid.
Previously on "Still the King"...
If it isn't the old Pool and Spa Depot girl.
And I do mean old.
Are you gonna let our daughter run off... with those rocker-looking dudes?
You see a couple of kids go by here?
They were headed out to Party Cove.
Oh, my god, we won!
- All right.
- Let's keep it moving, okay?
Is it rum, vodka?
Oh, my god, are you drunk?
- Gimme that!
- Vernon!
- Whoa!
- Whoa!
Hey, did we... you know...
Drop that axe!
Ah, wait a minute, hah... uh...
Burnin' Vernon?
I used to roadie for you back in the day!
Crazy Dave.
You know, on account that my name's Dave?
Right.
Yeah, yeah, I remember you.
Well, you see, I work for Trayne now... and that's his guitar that you're stealing.
Oh, oh, no, you don't understand.
See I knew Trayne was playing here... and what I thought I'd do is prank him... with the old "steal-the-guitar" prank.
Remember that, like I used to do back in the day... when he opened for me on tour?
Oh, yeah, the "steal-the-guitar" prank.
Hey, what the hell, you should come to the show tomorrow night.
Oh, man, I'd love to, man... but I gotta check my calendar, man.
I got like, a lot...
lotta busy stuff on my plate, man slamming.
But the fact of the matter is, if by chance... there would be an opening, I'll need me plus two.
Oh, no problem, I'll see you tomorrow night!
All right, man, I'll see you around.
Hey, Vern!
I am gonna need the guitar.
Hah!
Gotcha again, didn't I?
Yes, you did.
You are a joker.
- What?
- Oh, nothing...
Uh, just this guy at school said he beat your record... for chugging a bottle of syrup.
Was it that jackhole Andy Epstein?
Ronnie, no.
If you do, you'll be bouncing off the walls again.
Get my special occasion insulin.
I'm going in... time me.
Morning family!
Go.
Something smells good.
Hey Deb, you ain't by chance been missing something... you left down at the lake last weekend, have you?
The lake, of course, not.
I haven't even thought about the lake.
Well, if you ever want to return to the blue lagoon...
I'd be more than happy to oblige.
Done!
- Aw, shoot, looks like a tie.
- What?
I love that lake.
I'd like to be on it all the time.
Dude, what are you talking about?
Out on the lake?
You don't even own a boat.
Let alone know how to service one.
Well, I'm sure if I found a model I liked enough...
I could service it as often as it needed.
Can we just stop with the boat talk?
Well, come on, honey.
I've got a big surprise for you!
We need to get going.
Hope it's better than your last one.
And you still owe Dallas a new guitar.
I'm sorry, but I had to do what I had to do.
The guy was close-singing and uh...
Anyway I'm gonna make it up to you.
Come on, it's gonna be great.
- See you later, Deb.
- Bye.
- Ronald.
- Sir.
The sugar's settling in.
Ronnie, I'm gonna take you to dinner tonight.
Awesome.
We gonna go to...
No, baby, we're not going to Tepid's.
But... that's my favorite.
Don't you mean your second favorite?
Santa Fe Cattle Company?
Santa Fe Cattle Company.
Uh-oh... sugar's coming back with a vengeance.
Hitting me kind of hard.
Can't see...
Coming back.
Help!
Help!
Who's there?
Oh, all right, all right, see that?
It's like she knew exactly when to come over.
Attentive servers are a sign of the high life, Ronnie.
Yeah, we made it.
And I ordered your favorite dessert.
- Big-ass chocolate cake?
- Uh-huh.
Are you serious?
Wait, why are you being so nice to me?
Would you mind bringing my beautiful man here another beer?
He deserves it.
- Am I dying?
- Of course, not.
Pool and Spa Depot, we have a huge...
Another Pool and Spa Depot commercial.
For all your spa-ing needs.
And here comes stupid Pamela, in her stupid bikini.
Yee-haw!
Wait, she wasn't in the commercial.
- Ronnie, did you see that?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, no Pamela.
Ronnie, you wanna do one of your all-time... favorite activities?
You talking about ninja kicks?
- No.
- Doin' it in the yard?
Mm-mm... better.
Fake hot tub shopping.
Man, this is the best day ever!
Wait, why you doi...
Did you cheat on me?
Ha-ha, your freakin' face, you're killing me.
I'm just bustin' your balls.
Let's go tubbin'!
Oh, you are gonna love this!
Trayne Crostown puts on a helluva show.
Oh, he's been known to sing... into the mouth of a crocodile on stage.
It's the perfect father-daughter activity.
Why is he here?
Man, I remember going on tour with my dad when I was a kid.
We used to come down here.
Pretty big country music fan.
I don't know, it's not really my thing.
You've never been to a country music concert... with the Burnin' Vernon.
I mean, we're VIPs here.
- Suck it!
Suck it!
- These are my people!
Suck it!
Yeah!
Your people are a real class act.
Yeah, well, you ain't gonna be so high and mighty... when we get inside.
Our seats are right in the middle of the action, come on!
These seats aren't so bad.
It kinda makes ya reflect on how small we are in this universe.
See, you may think we have bad seats... but actually we got a great view.
This is BS, we're going for an upgrade.
Listen, those seats were just fine.
I don't want to cause any trouble or anything.
Oh, no, don't be silly...
I'm sure they just gave us the wrong tickets, that's all.
How you doing, sir?
It's nice to see you.
I'm here to see Trayne.
Everybody here to see Trayne.
Ha, that's a good one.
No, I'm actually a special guest.
I gave the boy his break, name's Vernon Brown.
You're not on the list.
Hey, wait a minute, you didn't check the list for those two.
Hot chicks.
All right, just follow my lead.
If anything goes wrong, we scatter, okay?
All right, come on, look important, you ready?
Let's roll.
Clyde, get the investors on the line!
These investors aren't investing!
I don't see it in my... papers.
Someone get me more papers!
I can't talk right now, I'm a very important person.
I can't believe it worked!
See, what'd I tell ya?
Ya just look like you belong... and the next thing you know, you're in, it's the way life is.
Now... save yourselves!
Come on, let's go, let's go, come on.
Guys, easy, man, easy, I got an image to protect here.
- Come on, you're ruffling the...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa...
Burnin' Vernon Brown!
Man, I thought you was dead!
Lil' Trayne!
Man, oh, man, I ain't seen you... since you opened that show for me in Houston.
That's right, I opened for you, now you're trying to sneak in... to my sold-out, massive arena show.
Man, that's rich!
Like me.
Let him go, fellas, he's harmless.
Let's go get our pre-party on!
Hey, all right, man, it looks like you're doing pretty good.
Not too bad, baby.
- I think we could do it!
- I'm in!
Well, this is... pretty sweet.
Yeah.
So, it's just me and you now, huh?
15... you're probably just starting... to make your own electricity.
Hey, Crazy Dave!
It's uh...
I'm Robert Murray's boy.
It's been forever, man.
Wait, you're Lil' Walt Murray?
Yup.
God, you were a weird, little kid.
You used to talk about bigfoot and aliens and all that crap.
So what are you doing now?
This and that.
Got the chum, feeding the shark!
10-4 on the shark.
Did you say shark?
Here?
Yeah, well, Trayne's got this ritual that he does every night.
He's gotta face death in the face with a real shark.
It's the only way he can keep his high going... once he gets off the stage.
Listen, I've gotta go.
Oh, you need to have one of these.
What is this?
Oh, it's Backstage Backwash.
It's Trayne's signature cocktail.
I was sober six years when I started working here.
But when the boss says jump, I'm jumping, let's go!
- I gotta see that shark.
- I gotta see that shark.
I wouldn't be caught dead in one of these things.
Are you gonna buy a hot tub, or what?
Maybe... maybe not.
But if you work on commission, I'd tread lightly, brother.
Okay.
Hey, where you going with that skanky cut-out... of the Pool and Spa Depot Girl?
To the trash, where she belongs!
What are you doing here?
You never leave the flagship store.
I wanted to personally oversee the purging of Pamela's... cheating whore face from my stores.
Shut... up.
She cheated on you?
Yeah.
What kind of horrible, rotten person would do that to you?
You did.
Trace-kins... baby, this isn't about me.
Aw, come here.
You just here tell me every horrible, despicable detail.
Okay, well, let's see, she was all dressed up, you know?
What do you think of that soothing background music?
It's all right... kinda reminds me of elevator music.
Switch!
- Hey, you want some sushi?
- Huh?
T.K. here, he'll make you anything you want.
Everything he prepares is endangered.
We got the golden chopsticks.
I'm not very good with chopsticks... but I would take you up on some of that Backstage Backwash...
- if you got any!
- Backwash!
It's made with top shelf rum and reclaimed Fanta... we get snuck in from Colombia.
Woo!
That even tastes illegal.
I know, I know.
Man, I just...
I don't know what I'd do if I lost all this stuff.
Speaking of, what you got going on?
Oh, I'm doing the Incognito Tour... kinda keeping' it low key.
Man, you seem kind of tense.
Now, you want that Balinese to walk on your back... with those tiny, little, baby feet?
Just say the word, she's real little...
Hey, Yon!
Hey, man!
Hey, Vernon, do you know Yon, Yon Aswad?
He's the head cheese for Rock Records Magazine.
He's doing a little piece on me.
I don't want the attention.
I hate it, but Yon insists.
We've met.
Vernon, you got the number one record in the country right now.
How does it feel?
My bad.
I think I gotta piss.
What's up?
My bad.
Joanna, will you marry me?
My bad.
Oh, I'm sorry, man, my memory is just about gone!
Hey, you know, my daughter, she's been doing... a lot of writing about music and musicians.
Maybe she could take a meeting with you... and you could give her some career advice?
I'd love to meet your daughter.
Hey, man, 100 watts.
I told you guys, 60-watt soft, all right?
Come on, get it.
Damn, man.
That shark has got to be around here somewhere.
How many places can you hide a shark, anyway?
Depends on the size of the shark... and if it's a male or a female.
Oh, this has got to be it.
Wait, this is it?
That's a really tiny shark.
Well, you know, sometimes when things are tiny... they're more fierce in the animal kingdom.
- Walt!
- It was an accident!
Maybe no one will notice.
Oh, that's not good.
Okay, um, let's just sneak out of here... and then nobody has to know.
Everybody knows.
If they find out the tiny shark is dead... they can just go back to the tapes and trace it back to us!
Well, what're we supposed to do?
We need a decoy shark.
I know a guy.
Come on, let's get out of here.
I mean, one minute, we're at the County Fair... and she's right there and we're all lady-and-the-tramp'ing... a fried twinkie, and then the next minute.
- 'Scuse me, amigo.
- Yeah, whatever.
Pam-cakes?
What are y'all doing in there?
Peeing.
Peeing?
You know, Trace, it's times like these... when you gotta look at the big picture... and ask yourself some pretty tough questions.
Like what's gonna happen to the Pool and Spa Depot girl?
I can't think about that right now.
The Pool and Spa Depot girl is...
she's a regional institution.
I don't know, I got no proof she was boosting sales, anyway.
Let me show you what a real Pool and Spa Depot girl... can do to boost your sales.
Got your booty call, Walt.
It wasn't a booty call, Coy.
You're weirdin' me out.
Well, every phone call is a potential booty call... if you play your cards right.
I'm looking for a fish, okay?
Yeah, well, you've come to the right spot.
Your fish is my command.
Look... but it's a very specific kind of fish... and you have to handle this with complete discretion, okay?
I'm in a slippery situation here.
Ah, lucky for you, handling slippery situations... is Coy's forte.
Okay, I'm looking for a baby shark, like a tiny shark... about this big.
Do you have any idea what you're asking me for, my friend?
I mean, no, not really.
I don't know a lot about tiny sharks.
Don't move.
Myanmar hand shark... eh...
As rare as it is tiny... as tiny as it is deadly, as deadly as it is... rare.
Okay, I got it.
How much do I owe you?
This one's on me...
but the next one's on you.
Okay, I'm gonna give you $20... and then this transaction is over forever, okay?
Okay, I've gotta say, this is pretty cool.
Whoa, Yon!
This is my daughter I was telling you about.
She's the one that's a writer.
This is Yon, he works for Rock Records.
He might be able to give you a little career advice.
Awesome.
Nice to meet you.
Oh, the pleasure is all mine.
Thanks, everybody, thank you very much.
Earlier today, when I was riding around on my fancy golf cart...
I saw an old buddy of mine trying to sneak in the show.
- Oh, just kidding.
- Trayne is asking for you.
- Uh, Trayne's onstage.
- Let's bring him out... and see if he's still has the golden pipes.
Put your hands together for my old buddy, Burnin' Vernon!
Go!
- Are you serious?
- Go on!
And the best thing about the "Slow and Low 2"... is it's lounge-style seating... so you can just lay down and relax... without worrying about slipping off that bench...
Babe, you got my spares?
Did I tell y'all about the antibacterial coating?
Now, if you're looking for the ultimate relaxation... spa experience, well, you just can't beat... the cascade waterfall feature in our VIP collection.
So if you just want to follow me.
♪ Then I was in Hollywood wishing I was doin' good ♪
♪ Talking on the telephone line ♪
♪ They don't need me in the movies ♪
♪ Ain't nobody sings my songs ♪
She just couldn't erase the memory of her engagement ring... floating in a puddle of pretzel barf... so I had to buy her a new one.
Now my therapist says I have Emetophobia.
Know what that is?
Uh, fear of vomiting.
Vernon Brown really is the worst person in the music business.
You know what, thank you so much for the great career advice.
I'd really love to hear more... but I'm kind of feeling a little, uh...
No... no.
Queasy.
Hey, hey, check it out.
Replacement shark.
Did you even look at it?
Sorry, it was dark and rapey there.
Whoo!
Okay, the set is complete.
We got the shark room's ETA, one minute, one minute, people.
Great big hand for Burnin' Vernon!
We'll see y'all next year!
Thank you very much!
Man, I can't believe you did that.
Well, I guess I'm a sucker.
I had to throw an old dog a bone!
Standby, please.
We've got Trayne entering the Shark Room.
This is Medic 4, we are on standby at the perimeter.
10-4, Medic 4.
Silence!
Shark me.
Symphony.
Three, two, one.
Argh!
Argh!
Argh!
Whoo-hoo!
Ah, man!
Sometimes... sometimes you gotta look death in the face... just to know you're alive!
I mean, I can't...
I can't help it, I'm an adrenaline junkie.
Wait a minute...
Go, let's go!
Go, go, go!
What the hell just happened?
Thank you.
Congratulations...
best decision you ever made!
You're gonna love it!
All right, maybe the Pool and Spa Depot girl is important.
Damn straight!
And those were my first customers... already made my first sale.
Uh, your second sale.
Ronnie!
What the hell?
You had me sold at VIP waterfall.
Call my assistant next week... we'll set up a time for you to come in.
You did good, Deb-kins.
- Really?
That's great.
- Yep, really.
- Good job.
We'll see ya.
- Yay.
We're gonna need to make a return.
Ooh, I already peed in it a little bit!
That was awesome, thanks for taking me!
Now, hold on.
I got one more surprise for ya.
This is for that boy you hang out with...
Oh, Austin, Houston, Tex, whatever his name is.
I told you I was gonna make it up to you, here you go.
Really?
Sweet!
Thanks.
First hug from your daughter.
Kinda does a number on ya, doesn't it?
Yeah, no kiddin'.
Well, it was a nice thing you did.
Well, if you wanna keep the niceties coming, you know... we could always go for a little pleasure cruise.
Sorry, that ship has sailed and sunk.
You're looking at the new Pool and Spa Depot girl.
Really?
Well, congratulations.
Turns out filthy Pamela was slutting it... around the County Fair.
In a porta potty?
Really?
That's crazy.
Who with?
Don't know, don't care.
Well, congratulations.
You deserve it.
Thank you.
You stole that guitar, didn't you?
Who me?
I'd never take something that wasn't mine.
Previously on "Still the King"...
If it isn't the old Pool and Spa Depot girl.
And I do mean old.
Are you gonna let our daughter run off... with those rocker-looking dudes?
You see a couple of kids go by here?
They were headed out to Party Cove.
Oh, my god, we won!
- All right.
- Let's keep it moving, okay?
Is it rum, vodka?
Oh, my god, are you drunk?
- Gimme that!
- Vernon!
- Whoa!
- Whoa!
[VERNON] Hey, did we... you know...
(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)
Drop that axe!
(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)
Ah, wait a minute, hah... uh...
Burnin' Vernon?
I used to roadie for you back in the day!
Crazy Dave.
You know, on account that my name's Dave?
Right.
Yeah, yeah, I remember you.
Well, you see, I work for Trayne now... and that's his guitar that you're stealing.
Oh, oh, no, you don't understand.
See I knew Trayne was playing here... and what I thought I'd do is prank him... with the old "steal-the-guitar" prank.
Remember that, like I used to do back in the day... when he opened for me on tour?
Oh, yeah, the "steal-the-guitar" prank.
Hey, what the hell, you should come to the show tomorrow night.
Oh, man, I'd love to, man... but I gotta check my calendar, man.
I got like, a lot...
lotta busy stuff on my plate, man slamming.
But the fact of the matter is, if by chance... there would be an opening, I'll need me plus two.
Oh, no problem, I'll see you tomorrow night!
All right, man, I'll see you around.
Hey, Vern!
I am gonna need the guitar.
Hah!
Gotcha again, didn't I?
Yes, you did.
You are a joker.
- What?
- Oh, nothing...
Uh, just this guy at school said he beat your record... for chugging a bottle of syrup.
Was it that jackhole Andy Epstein?
Ronnie, no.
If you do, you'll be bouncing off the walls again.
Get my special occasion insulin.
I'm going in... time me.
Morning family!
Go.
Something smells good.
Hey Deb, you ain't by chance been missing something... you left down at the lake last weekend, have you?
The lake, of course, not.
I haven't even thought about the lake.
Well, if you ever want to return to the blue lagoon...
I'd be more than happy to oblige.
Done!
- Aw, shoot, looks like a tie.
- What?
I love that lake.
I'd like to be on it all the time.
Dude, what are you talking about?
Out on the lake?
You don't even own a boat.
Let alone know how to service one.
Well, I'm sure if I found a model I liked enough...
I could service it as often as it needed.
Can we just stop with the boat talk?
Well, come on, honey.
I've got a big surprise for you!
We need to get going.
Hope it's better than your last one.
And you still owe Dallas a new guitar.
I'm sorry, but I had to do what I had to do.
The guy was close-singing and uh...
Anyway I'm gonna make it up to you.
Come on, it's gonna be great.
- See you later, Deb.
- Bye.
- Ronald.
- Sir.
The sugar's settling in.
Ronnie, I'm gonna take you to dinner tonight.
Awesome.
We gonna go to...
No, baby, we're not going to Tepid's.
But... that's my favorite.
Don't you mean your second favorite?
Santa Fe Cattle Company?
Santa Fe Cattle Company.
Uh-oh... sugar's coming back with a vengeance.
Hitting me kind of hard.
Can't see...
Coming back.
Help!
Help!
Who's there?
Oh, all right, all right, see that?
It's like she knew exactly when to come over.
Attentive servers are a sign of the high life, Ronnie.
Yeah, we made it.
And I ordered your favorite dessert.
- Big-ass chocolate cake?
- Uh-huh.
Are you serious?
Wait, why are you being so nice to me?
Would you mind bringing my beautiful man here another beer?
He deserves it.
- Am I dying?
- Of course, not.
Pool and Spa Depot, we have a huge...
Another Pool and Spa Depot commercial.
For all your spa-ing needs.
And here comes stupid Pamela, in her stupid bikini.
Yee-haw!
Wait, she wasn't in the commercial.
- Ronnie, did you see that?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, no Pamela.
Ronnie, you wanna do one of your all-time... favorite activities?
You talking about ninja kicks?
- No.
- Doin' it in the yard?
Mm-mm... better.
Fake hot tub shopping.
Man, this is the best day ever!
Wait, why you doi...
Did you cheat on me?
Ha-ha, your freakin' face, you're killing me.
I'm just bustin' your balls.
Let's go tubbin'!
Oh, you are gonna love this!
Trayne Crostown puts on a helluva show.
Oh, he's been known to sing... into the mouth of a crocodile on stage.
It's the perfect father-daughter activity.
Why is he here?
Man, I remember going on tour with my dad when I was a kid.
We used to come down here.
Pretty big country music fan.
I don't know, it's not really my thing.
You've never been to a country music concert... with the Burnin' Vernon.
I mean, we're VIPs here.
- [CROWD] Suck it!
Suck it!
- These are my people!
Suck it!
Yeah!
Your people are a real class act.
Yeah, well, you ain't gonna be so high and mighty... when we get inside.
Our seats are right in the middle of the action, come on!
These seats aren't so bad.
It kinda makes ya reflect on how small we are in this universe.
See, you may think we have bad seats... but actually we got a great view.
This is BS, we're going for an upgrade.
Listen, those seats were just fine.
I don't want to cause any trouble or anything.
Oh, no, don't be silly...
I'm sure they just gave us the wrong tickets, that's all.
How you doing, sir?
It's nice to see you.
I'm here to see Trayne.
Everybody here to see Trayne.
Ha, that's a good one.
No, I'm actually a special guest.
I gave the boy his break, name's Vernon Brown.
You're not on the list.
Hey, wait a minute, you didn't check the list for those two.
Hot chicks.
All right, just follow my lead.
If anything goes wrong, we scatter, okay?
All right, come on, look important, you ready?
Let's roll.
Clyde, get the investors on the line!
These investors aren't investing!
I don't see it in my...
papers.
Someone get me more papers!
I can't talk right now, I'm a very important person.
I can't believe it worked!
See, what'd I tell ya?
Ya just look like you belong... and the next thing you know, you're in, it's the way life is.
Now... save yourselves!
Come on, let's go, let's go, come on.
Guys, easy, man, easy, I got an image to protect here.
- Come on, you're ruffling the...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa...
Burnin' Vernon Brown!
Man, I thought you was dead!
Lil' Trayne!
Man, oh, man, I ain't seen you... since you opened that show for me in Houston.
That's right, I opened for you, now you're trying to sneak in... to my sold-out, massive arena show.
Man, that's rich!
Like me.
Let him go, fellas, he's harmless.
Let's go get our pre-party on!
Hey, all right, man, it looks like you're doing pretty good.
Not too bad, baby.
- I think we could do it!
- I'm in!
Well, this is... pretty sweet.
Yeah.
So, it's just me and you now, huh?
15... you're probably just starting... to make your own electricity.
Hey, Crazy Dave!
It's uh...
I'm Robert Murray's boy.
It's been forever, man.
Wait, you're Lil' Walt Murray?
Yup.
God, you were a weird, little kid.
You used to talk about bigfoot and aliens and all that crap.
So what are you doing now?
This and that.
ASSISTANT (OVER RADIO):
Got the chum, feeding the shark!
10-4 on the shark.
Did you say shark?
Here?
Yeah, well, Trayne's got this ritual that he does every night.
He's gotta face death in the face with a real shark.
It's the only way he can keep his high going... once he gets off the stage.
Listen, I've gotta go.
Oh, you need to have one of these.
What is this?
Oh, it's Backstage Backwash.
It's Trayne's signature cocktail.
I was sober six years when I started working here.
But when the boss says jump, I'm jumping, let's go!
- I gotta see that shark.
- I gotta see that shark.
I wouldn't be caught dead in one of these things.
Are you gonna buy a hot tub, or what?
Maybe... maybe not.
But if you work on commission, I'd tread lightly, brother.
Okay.
Hey, where you going with that skanky cut-out... of the Pool and Spa Depot Girl?
To the trash, where she belongs!
What are you doing here?
You never leave the flagship store.
I wanted to personally oversee the purging of Pamela's... cheating whore face from my stores.
Shut... up.
She cheated on you?
Yeah.
What kind of horrible, rotten person would do that to you?
You did.
Trace-kins...
baby, this isn't about me.
Aw, come here.
You just here tell me every horrible, despicable detail.
Okay, well, let's see, she was all dressed up, you know?
What do you think of that soothing background music?
It's all right... kinda reminds me of elevator music.
Switch!
- Hey, you want some sushi?
- Huh?
T.K. here, he'll make you anything you want.
Everything he prepares is endangered.
We got the golden chopsticks.
I'm not very good with chopsticks... but I would take you up on some of that Backstage Backwash...
- if you got any!
- Backwash!
It's made with top shelf rum and reclaimed Fanta... we get snuck in from Colombia.
Woo!
That even tastes illegal.
I know, I know.
Man, I just...
I don't know what I'd do if I lost all this stuff.
Speaking of, what you got going on?
Oh, I'm doing the Incognito Tour... kinda keeping' it low key.
Man, you seem kind of tense.
Now, you want that Balinese to walk on your back... with those tiny, little, baby feet?
Just say the word, she's real little...
Hey, Yon!
Hey, man!
Hey, Vernon, do you know Yon, Yon Aswad?
He's the head cheese for Rock Records Magazine.
He's doing a little piece on me.
I don't want the attention.
I hate it, but Yon insists.
We've met.
Vernon, you got the number one record in the country right now.
How does it feel?
My bad.
I think I gotta piss.
What's up?
My bad.
Joanna, will you marry me?
My bad.
Oh, I'm sorry, man, my memory is just about gone!
Hey, you know, my daughter, she's been doing... a lot of writing about music and musicians.
Maybe she could take a meeting with you... and you could give her some career advice?
I'd love to meet your daughter.
Hey, man, 100 watts.
I told you guys, 60-watt soft, all right?
Come on, get it.
Damn, man.
That shark has got to be around here somewhere.
How many places can you hide a shark, anyway?
Depends on the size of the shark... and if it's a male or a female.
Oh, this has got to be it.
Wait, this is it?
That's a really tiny shark.
Well, you know, sometimes when things are tiny... they're more fierce in the animal kingdom.
- Walt!
- It was an accident!
Maybe no one will notice.
Oh, that's not good.
Okay, um, let's just sneak out of here... and then nobody has to know.
Everybody knows.
If they find out the tiny shark is dead... they can just go back to the tapes and trace it back to us!
Well, what're we supposed to do?
We need a decoy shark.
I know a guy.
Come on, let's get out of here.
I mean, one minute, we're at the County Fair... and she's right there and we're all lady-and-the-tramp'ing... a fried twinkie, and then the next minute.
- 'Scuse me, amigo.
- Yeah, whatever.
Pam-cakes?
What are y'all doing in there?
Peeing.
Peeing?
You know, Trace, it's times like these... when you gotta look at the big picture... and ask yourself some pretty tough questions.
Like what's gonna happen to the Pool and Spa Depot girl?
I can't think about that right now.
The Pool and Spa Depot girl is... she's a regional institution.
I don't know, I got no proof she was boosting sales, anyway.
Let me show you what a real Pool and Spa Depot girl... can do to boost your sales.
Got your booty call, Walt.
It wasn't a booty call, Coy.
You're weirdin' me out.
Well, every phone call is a potential booty call... if you play your cards right.
I'm looking for a fish, okay?
Yeah, well, you've come to the right spot.
Your fish is my command.
Look... but it's a very specific kind of fish... and you have to handle this with complete discretion, okay?
I'm in a slippery situation here.
Ah, lucky for you, handling slippery situations... is Coy's forte.
Okay, I'm looking for a baby shark, like a tiny shark... about this big.
Do you have any idea what you're asking me for, my friend?
I mean, no, not really.
I don't know a lot about tiny sharks.
Don't move.
Myanmar hand shark... eh...
As rare as it is tiny... as tiny as it is deadly, as deadly as it is... rare.
Okay, I got it.
How much do I owe you?
This one's on me... but the next one's on you.
Okay, I'm gonna give you $20... and then this transaction is over forever, okay?
Okay, I've gotta say, this is pretty cool.
Whoa, Yon!
This is my daughter I was telling you about.
She's the one that's a writer.
This is Yon, he works for Rock Records.
He might be able to give you a little career advice.
Awesome.
Nice to meet you.
Oh, the pleasure is all mine.
[TRAYNE] Thanks, everybody, thank you very much.
Earlier today, when I was riding around on my fancy golf cart...
I saw an old buddy of mine trying to sneak in the show.
- Oh, just kidding.
- Trayne is asking for you.
- Uh, Trayne's onstage.
- Let's bring him out... and see if he's still has the golden pipes.
Put your hands together for my old buddy, Burnin' Vernon!
Go!
- Are you serious?
- Go on!
And the best thing about the "Slow and Low 2"... is it's lounge-style seating... so you can just lay down and relax... without worrying about slipping off that bench...
Babe, you got my spares?
Did I tell y'all about the antibacterial coating?
Now, if you're looking for the ultimate relaxation... spa experience, well, you just can't beat... the cascade waterfall feature in our VIP collection.
So if you just want to follow me.

She just couldn't erase the memory of her engagement ring... floating in a puddle of pretzel barf... so I had to buy her a new one.
Now my therapist says I have Emetophobia.
Know what that is?
Uh, fear of vomiting.
Vernon Brown really is the worst person in the music business.
You know what, thank you so much for the great career advice.
I'd really love to hear more... but I'm kind of feeling a little, uh...
No... no.
Queasy.
Hey, hey, check it out.
Replacement shark.
Did you even look at it?
Sorry, it was dark and rapey there.
Whoo!
ASSISTANT (OVER RADIO):
Okay, the set is complete.
We got the shark room's ETA, one minute, one minute, people.
Great big hand for Burnin' Vernon!
We'll see y'all next year!
Thank you very much!
Man, I can't believe you did that.
Well, I guess I'm a sucker.
I had to throw an old dog a bone!
ASSISTANT (OVER RADIO):
Standby, please.
We've got Trayne entering the Shark Room.
[MEDIC] This is Medic 4, we are on standby at the perimeter.

Well, congratulations.
You deserve it.
Thank you.
You stole that guitar, didn't you?
Who me?
I'd never take something that wasn't mine.
If you have a baby, I can come to babysit in the morning at your house.
I'll remember this.
No, follow me.
- What's happening?
What did I say?
- Come, dammit.
Monica likes Joan.
Period.
Is it bad?
Yes.
Yes, but be a bit stoic and assume that Monica is not the only girl in the world.
Have fun.
Jesus!
Enjoy.
I'm leaving now.
Now?
If you're free, why don't you have dinner with us?
Pau would like it.
What a boring conversation, son!
Marc, am I stupid?
- You still like him?
- No way.
Sure?
Are you looking for a remedial teacher for your brother?
Yes.
If you want, I can...
Well, thank you.
If you need me to work for the weekends, I'm okay with it.
You can change in the kitchen, if you want.
Ah, sorry.
What if you or I have a sexual history with someone else?
You're proposing an open relationship?
Well, open.
Perhaps, not everything.
Let's say with a closed door.
We have been like this for a week.
We hardly talk.
Since the infamous dinner in which you felt attacked by me.
- No, I'm not up for lectures, mom.
- No, you have to listen to me.
You have been living here for months.
You said it was temporary.
But it seems that we have different concepts about temporality.
I have been indirectly told you for weeks.
Since you don't react, I'll tell you this:
"I want you to leave now."
Well, I don't now if...
If what?
If it is a good time.
It's never a good time.
I ask you to wait.
Just that.
No, son.
What's wrong?
- You need time to make plans with Gina?
- Don't you start!
Not that.
It's...
Nothing.
I'll look for a house.
I don't care.
What's going on?
Speak.
Tell me.
Just between us.
I don't want Bruno to know.
- You promise?
- Yes!
I'm...
I'm waiting for some tests.
Tests?
Yes, tests, dammit, tests!
Medical ones.
What do you have?
I don't know yet.
I hope it's nothing.
I'll know soon.
Where do you hurt?
- It would be a nuisance if you tell Bruno and Gina.
- I won't say anything!
I'm your mother and I have to know.
I had an upset stomach.
- The doctor told me a long time ago to have it checked...
- And you didn't do it.
You know that I don't like hospitals.
But in the end, I gave up.
The doctor wants to underline one...
You know what.
It doesn't matter.
I'll have the result soon.
You should have told me before.
I'm going to class.
It's the only thing that can help me not to think.
Mom, please, don't make the worried face.
Please.
I'm trying to focus on other things...
and seeing you with that face...
Bye.
Silence!
Peripatetics!
Silence!
Silence!
Today, we'll talk about lies, and how they can be useful in daily life.
Immanuel Kant...
Merlí is talking about a philosophy in the book.
Thank you, thank you, thank you!
So lovely.
Uri, since you've spoken, I'll ask you this:
Imagine that a man is hiding in your house, fleeing from someone who wants to kill him.
When the murderer arrives, he asks you if there's a man hiding in your house.
Will you lie to him?
Yes.
To save that man.
Then, Kant said that even in those situations, you can't lie.
It's weird.
Don't be alarmed.
Relax.
Kant says that you mustn't lie even when we think it's justified.
The question is:
Is a moral order feasible in a society that allows lies?
Merlí, this is fine, but sometimes it is necessary to lie, right?
Yes, it's true.
In fact, politicians constantly do it.
But if they listened to Kant, do you think it would be better?
It's impossible not to lie.
We all lie.
When we were small, they told us: "Ah, girl, don't tell lies." But after that, they are saying that there are kings who are from the East.
Good example, Tania!
Good example.
More things: there are couples who survive on lies.
I guess you don't mean you and my mother, right?
Did you hear that I say "I guess you don't mean you and my mother"?
Well, Gerard, let's focus on Kant.
His ethics say that the moral act has value in itself, not in its consequences.
This can be summarized in the Kantian formulation of Categorical imperative that says:
Act only according to that maxim whereby you can, at the same time, will that should become a universal law.
An example to understand would be:
You don't want for others what you don't want for you.
Marc, your mother is a nurse, right?
Yes.
Very good.
Imagine that she has to save the life of a pederast knowing who he is,
And the day after being cured, the man abuses a minor.
Should she have cured him?
My mother wouldn't cure him.
I'm sure.
Kant would say that she should.
He believed that from the moral point of view,
It is not viable a world where people are saved depending on whether they are good or bad.
One thing, I'm a bit stuck with that murderer thing.
This guy must have no friends, right?
On the contrary, he had friends and took good care of them.
Listen, dad.
I can call you "dad", right?
Since you're dating my mother...
What, my son?
No, just...
Sometimes, we lies to ourselves, you know?
That's deep, Geri!
Very good, Gerard.
Dad, at last, someone smart in the family.
Stop, man.
Holy shit!
Inhaler, inhaler, Geri.
Cutie!
Jesus!
I'm not used to being called "cutie".
My mom calls me that but I don't like it.
Yeah?
You and I, what?
What is what?
We have been talking through WhatsApp for days but nothing happens.
You mean you want to be with me?
Is it weird?
Don't imitate me.
It's just that...
I mean...
The girls who I have been with were more complicated.
You know?
I'm different.
I like you, and I want to be with you.
Okay.
Awesome.
- Where can we meet?
- My house is impossible.
We can go to a bar, if you want?
Or go straight to my house.
My mother comes home late from work.
We can stay there.
I have a very cute dog.
I'm not interested in your dog.
Of course not.
Fuck the dog.
Come in.
Hello.
- I come to hand in the research work.
- Very good.
It's only the first part for now.
Yeah.
I'll have a look and I'll tell you later.
Thank you.
- I close the door?
- Yes, please.
- Bye, Toni.
- Bye.
Ah, Vilaseca!
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry for your grandmother.
What about my mother?
Your grandmother has died.
My grandmother has died?
Your brother has just told me...
Right, right.
It was the excuse for not handing in the writing.
- He told you that my grandmother had died to not hand in some homework?
- I don't think it's funny.
I'll fail him.
- No, please, Eugeni.
I'll talk to him and he'll hand it in..
- After having lied to me?
No.
- He told you that my grandmother had died to not hand in some homework?
- I don't think it's funny.
I'll fail him.
- No, please, Eugeni.
I'll talk to him and he'll hand it in..
- After having lied to me?
No.
- I know that my brother is difficult.
- Just difficult?
- He annoys the class, doesn't hand in homework.
And I can't take it because he makes many misspellings.
- I know.
I'll do anything I can to have him handed it in time.
- He annoys the class, doesn't hand in homework.
And I can't take it because he makes many misspellings.
- I know.
I'll do anything I can to have him handed it in time.
Right.
I'll talk to him and in your next class, he'll surely hand it to you.
Please.
The day after tomorrow.
- It has to be there.
- Okay, thank you.
And thank you for giving me encouragement for my grandmother's death.
Excuse me.
I hate makeup tests.
- It won't be long.
- It's already late.
You came very early today.
I should have my own makeup.
Just like Bette Davis.
But I already know the monologue.
Kid, get me something to drink.
Don't you see that I'm nervous?
What do you want?
Gas.
Any drink that has E-331.
Never...
Never have you seen things from my point of view.
I was sure that you would become admirable beings.
As time goes by, what have you become?
Riego proclaimed the restoration of the Cadiz Constitution, which, as I have explained, was in the year ...
Anyone know which year?
A minute to find it.
What is it that I like most of the mountain?
The silence it has.
I hope that during the lesson, you'll make me feel calm like I'm in the calm and placid meadow of Cerdagne.
You know Cerdagne, right?
It's near Europe.
I know you are able to be quiet.
Look how beautiful you all look.
Now, anyone knows?
Roberta!
The date of the...
The date of the Cadiz Constitution?
I can't find it.
You can't find it or you didn't note it down?
Anyone know?
Who knows the date of the Cadiz Constitution?
Bruno.
You know the date?
Eh, no.
1812.
I think you will all get a Titanic on the test.
Do you know what the passengers on Titanic did when they were drowning?
They held on a float.
This is the grade that you'll get.
Bruno!
Can you tell me why you know the date of the Cadiz Constitution but kept quiet?
I didn't know it.
I saw you take note of it.
Why did you say nothing?
I'll tell you.
It's bad to become a jerk along with Coralina - the witch.
OK, yes.
I did something that makes them treat me like a jerk.
So, I didn't say anything.
If you act to please others, you'll never be pleased yourself.
You have to be selfish in life.
Yes, I know.
The more selfish you are, the happier you will be.
If in the exam, you can get good grade, don't act like an insufficient student.
"Basuraca"?
"Basuraca"?
- I liked it when I was 13.
- Shut up.
What are you saying?
It's like the rock that has padlocks on.
There are people who hang padlocks on bridges to show their love.
That's amazing.
They are idiots.
The other day, I flipped through a book that had this phrase:
"Love has imprisoned me in you.
I want to be locked in the prison of your heart."
"Basuraca"!
See you tomorrow.
Hey, dude.
He likes Coralina.
Bruno is too much!
Why didn't you say anything to that woman?
I don't know what's wrong with me.
My mind went blank.
I would like to tell her that she's a bitch.
How is your job at the bar?
Alright.
Great.
At least my father doesn't bother me.
And Ivan's mother is very nice.
Man!
Good, the job is good.
She doesn't pay much.
You really are beautiful.
Pol ...
What?
We are always the same, right?
Yes then no.
Better not.
Yes, yes, no problem.
Do you think I'm an easy girl?
No.
Why did you say that?
You told your mother that you were sick?
Really?
With my mother, you have to have a dramatic plan.
It's really good!
- But she must be worried.
- Yes, whatever you say but she wanted me to fuck off.
- This way, I can stay.
- No, if she knows the truth, she'll have more reasons to kick you out.
Don't say this to anyone.
Bruno doesn't know.
No, I won't say anything.
I won't fail you.
I'm your only friend.
What?
Wait a minute.
What did you say?
My "only friend"?
What's wrong?
- A friend.
- Eh, listen.
The work that you did with me is done.
I got you back to school.
That's it.
Now don't give me the cartoon that we're pals.
Especially, not that you're only friend I have.
How the fuck do you know that I don't have friends?
Besides, do you think I need a friend your age?
Jesus, I don't know what the fuck I am doing walking with a brat.
With a "brat"?
Well, fuck off, kid.
Well, if I'm a "brat" to you, then I'll skip your fucking class!
Moron!
Hi.
Have you seen Pau's room?
Pau, don't go out until you clean up.
Understand?
- Fuck!
- Mom!
Really?
You don't have to put it like that.
It's okay.
You don't come in his room a lot anyway.
What do you mean?
You're not home much.
And when you are, you sleep.
Listen, do you think I like working at nights?
No, but in the afternoon, you can spend some time with Pau.
Compare the times that I'm with him with the ones with his father.
- Zero!
- Okay.
You always bring dad out.
I know that he ignores us.
He has promised me the pension for months, but I haven't seen a dime.
I don't have to go to the hospital in two hours, but I'll go buy clothes because I've never brought myself a gift.
Any inconvenience?
No.
Perfect.
Goodbye, Pau!
You.
How dare you tell Eugeni that our grandmother died?
You told me you didn't have homework.
No, shut up.
You have two days to finish the writing.
I don't want to do it.
What are you saying?
You have to do it.
What topic is that?
"Write without misspellings, about members of your family. "
Well, it's okay.
It's easy.
Talk about cousins, uncles, about me.
For that matter, talk about granny, yeah?
Has your grandmother come home?
No.
She's rehearsing, I think.
If you eat all my fuet (a kind of sausage), you'll have to go buy more.
Jesus, dad.
So selfish, right?
What?
Coralina?
Has she fucked you up yet?
I do the research work with her.
No shit?
Jesus!
Eat.
You need energy.
- Now, eat, eat.
- Dad, stop.
- Eat!
- Dad, stop it!
- What are those screams?
- Bruno, please, I beg you.
Go to your room.
I don't want to argue.
Go to your room.
Please.
Are you okay?
Didn't you hear?
Go!
The last thing I need.
- How are you feeling?
- Good, good.
- I shouldn't have said anything.
Jesus!
- Yes.
I want to know.
No, listen.
In any case, I think that you're right.
I'll look for a house and that's it.
- I don't want us to live with this sad atmosphere.
- Stop talking nonsense.
Don't move out.
Understand?
Understand?
- I'll go get some air.
- Okay.
Damn, man.
Look, look.
This is where Merlí and my mother hook up.
Really?
So sexy, right?
Well...
Sexy and my mother...
No.
Do you know that you're fucking funny?
Yeah.
All the girls I've been with laughed a lot.
You've had a lot of sex?
Yes, a lot.
Yes.
I was with a girl from Girona.
With one from Berga whom I met on the internet.
And...
You were in Berga?
Well, in Manresa, which is halfway.
Yeah.
How do you like the kisses?
What?
How do you like the kisses?
You like long, short, soft ...?
I don't know.
How do you like them?
I don't know.
What a question.
I don't know.
I don't know.
Do you like them like this?
Or do you prefer...?
Well, I guess the latter is cooler.
- How is the prettiest waitress in Barcelona?
- Merlí!
Oh, up close, you're even prettier.
Come on, Merlí, we know each other.
How are you?
Fine.
The daily routine.
School, classes...
And me with the bar routine.
And Ivan?
How is he doing in class?
Ivan?
Very bright.
- Want a drink?
My treat.
- A beer.
Okay.
I have wanted to see you for days.
And today, I decided.
Suddenly, I missed you.
You know...
The teacher's loneliness and...
Merlí, don't start.
We won't be back.
You're with Gerard's mother.
And since when is that an impediment?
Come on, Merlí, please.
Miriam, where can I put these boxes.
Man, Merlí!
Damn.
Ivan hasn't told you that Pol's working here?
No.
And we're friends.
Only the evenings and Saturdays.
Great.
- Leave them here.
Bring the others, please.
- Okay.
If you want to have an intimate talk, call me.
He'll teach you philosophy.
He's really good.
But I'm better, eh?
- Amazing, girl, amazing.
- The first time is amazing, yes.
- No, not the first time.
- Shut up, silly.
I know that you have fucked before.
And I like it.
Okay.
Sorry.
Good morning.
How are you?
Fine.
I'm leaving.
Great.
Bye.
Bye.
- Really?
He said that your grandmother had died?
- Yes, really, unbelievable.
- Pau is clever, huh.
- Right.
Well, perhaps, if you can teach him...
- But if you don't want to, then it's okay, really.
- No, of course not.
No problem.
Perfect.
Because he has an essay.
- If you want, I can stay with him in the canteen, in the library or at your house.
- Cool.
In the canteen.
- Okay.
- In the canteen.
I'll tell him.
Thank you so much.
- Okay.
Relax.
- Okay.
- In the canteen.
I'll tell him.
Thank you so much.
- Okay.
- In the canteen.
I'll tell him.
Thank you so much.
It's "too much", man.
I'm so in love.
You fucked Oksana.
Congratulations, dude!
It was time!
- Thank you.
- Now, forget Monica.
Monica?
Monica who?
You can relax now.
Gerard won't bother you anymore.
Did you guy hook up?
Yes.
It was fucking great.
How are you with Joan?
Good.
Really good.
Is Joan big, too?
Sit down, bipeds!
Silence!
Merlí, I have a question about Kant.
Hey, attention!
Pol has a question!
No.
I have been thinking about the murderer thing, and about whether we should tell the truth when someone hides in our house.
And Kant said that we have a moral duty not to lie.
Yes.
Okay.
Is the moral duty more important than saving a life?
Good question.
But to Kant, the truth is above the physical safety of any person.
According to him, if we all have the right to lie, we could hardly trust each other.
And if there's no trust, no society can be created.
Wait a minute, where is Ivan?
Nobody knows?
Oliver, where is he?
I don't know.
I have a polygraph.
If I were you, I would listen to Kant's Categorical Imperative, and tell everyone what I know.
He is at the bar under here.
Playing truant.
Wait for me here.
I'm going.
No shit.
He's looking for him at the bar.
You want me to do imitations or something?
Yes, yes, yes!
Do Eugeni.
You!
To class!
Bullshit.
Because of you, I left your classmates without the privilege of having me explaining Immanuel Kant.
You told me that.
I have the right to play truant, right?
I won't return to class until you come with me.
Yesterday, you treated me badly.
Maybe I'm not your friend, but I don't deserve to be treated like that.
Forget about us being friends.
I'm your teacher and I want you in class.
Now!
You're shameless!
- You know I've been thinking about what you told your mom.
- Don't meddle in personal matters.
Then you shouldn't have told me.
I feel bad that you make her suffer with such a serious thing.
An illness!
- You show very little maturity.
- Yeah!
Said a 17-year-old kid.
I'm more mature than you.
At least I don't tell my mom that I'm dying!
It's cruel, it's pathetic, and it's from a bad person.
Oh yeah?
Then why do you want to have me as your friend when you think I'm a bad person?
Anyone know the name of the author of "Tirant the White"?
He talks just like Eugeni Bosch.
It's cool!
Nobody know his name?
He nailed it, right?
You have problem, little Bergeron?
Pol Rubio, want to get expelled?
Come in.
Bravo!
Truant player.
- Ivan, I'm sorry,
- You'd better.
He forced me to tell him.
We continue with Kant.
Some authors told him that the truth didn't have to be kept at any cost.
What do you think?
I think that lies are necessary.
Don't say that to Merlí, Tania.
He never lies.
Ivan, let your friend talk.
If we don't lie, we will argue every now and then.
Lying is necessary.
It comes in advance to not look for troubles, right?
To win votes, too.
- If those politicians don't tell lies, no one will vote for them.
- I don't listen to them.
They treat us like jerks.
They are a gang of hypocrites who just want our votes.
You want my vote?
Bullshit!
Just like my grandmother say: "Climb up here and you can see the Canterbury."
Your mother must be great, eh, Merlí.
Say hello to her for me.
I'll do that for you, Ivan.
Continue!
Perfect, Toni.
Yes, yes.
See you at school this afternoon.
Great.
I gotta go.
See you later.
Bye.
Carmina.
Do you have limoncello?
Yes.
Come in.
Oh, Gina.
I can't take it anymore.
What's wrong with you?
Not me.
It's Merlí.
Merlí!
Your mother has come to see me.
Jesus.
Gina, don't be sad.
No, it's not true that I'm sick.
I made that up.
What?
Explain to me.
What?
I did that for her to shut up.
She didn't stop telling me to move out.
I told her that I'm waiting for some tests' result.
That's it.
Are you nuts?
- How could you do that to your mother?
Your own mother!
- Please, Gina.
Don't you understand?
I'll soon tell her that the tests have gone well, that I'm totally healthy,
- And she would have the mother instinct and wouldn't want me to move out.
- Mother instinct?
- I'm shocked.
- I admit that she had a rather baroque expression.
How dare you do such a thing?
Your mother is so scared and so am I!
Jesus.
I thought that you had cancer!
- I'm sorry.
- No, you have played with a very delicate matter.
I know.
I won't do it anymore.
"I won't do it anymore"?
Are you a kid?
You're an adult!
- Go see your mother now.
Stop making her suffer.
- Okay.
I'll tell her that I'm fine.
That's it.
No, tell her the truth!
Because that's an excuse for you to stay with her.
Yes or no?
Yes.
Is it that hard for you to say what you think?
What you feel?
Merlí, I'm fine with you, but you scare me.
- Hey, Gina...
- No!
How do you want me to stay calm after this?
You lied to me about the vacation.
Merlí, go tell her the truth.
Or else, you and I are done.
They are too small for me!
We have to try another, kid.
Enough.
I'm 40 and I can't put up with you calling me "kid".
I can be jobless.
But don't call me "kid" again.
It is clear?
I like you now.
Leave.
You already have the results?
Yes.
They're good.
I'm fine.
You sure?
Yes.
I didn't do the tests.
Well, I have...
I have...
I have made it up.
Made up?
You wanted to kick me out, so I made up an illness so I can stay.
I know it's not right.
- Motherfucker!
- I know that I'm such a jerk to tell you something like that.
But I didn't know how to make you understand that... dammit, that I want to live with you.
Today, you sleep in a hotel!
Mom, please, can you be quiet for a moment?
Let me explain.
I know I'm very independent, but I'm used to living with you and Bruno.
And I like it.
I like it.
I don't know.
I like to come home and enjoy you talk shit about your job and fucking recite Shakespeare when I least expect.
I don't know.
And those drinks that we have while talking.
I have fun with you.
And thank to you, my relationship with Bruno has gone well.
Whenever we argued, you make peace between us.
I'm still learning to be a father.
You get me?
And with you beside me, I'm doing better.
What would happen if Bruno and I go live alone together?
Now that things have been better for us, I don't want it to spoil.
Can we continue living together?
Please.
Don't you think about what you would do from now on?
No, mom.
I'm not the one that says those things...
I'm overwhelmed, dammit.
You know me.
Yes.
I've made a mistake of lying about such a delicate matter.
Yes, you screwed up completely.
Idiot!
So you want to live with me ...
Vouchsafe, defused infection of a man, For these known evils, but to give me leave.
"Richard III".
I don't know where you got that from.
Your father wasn't like this.
You should pay attention to the mistakes.
Or else, Eugeni will fail you.
"Vaig" (go) isn't written like that.
Ah, with the "b"?
No, I mean it doesn't have "x".
It ends with "g".
Okay.
Oh, Pau, don't be sad.
You can do it.
The most important thing is that you remember how to write after this.
That's all.
Are you and Marc dating?
No.
Come on.
No, we're just friends.
Let's continue with the writing.
Marc never talks about any girl.
Only you.
Of course.
because I'm helping you and such.
What does he say about me?
He gets along well with you.
He's always in good mood when talking about you.
So I thought you were dating.
Well, we aren't.
Marc.
I'm hungry.
Do you have money?
Don't tell me no.
- You promised to give me if I do the homework.
- Okay.
But I know you took 2 euros on the nightstand.
Me?
Don't lie to me.
- I needed a pen.
- Come on, leave.
Why are you smiling?
Nothing.
We haven't finished with the writing.
Well, it's okay.
He doesn't like the topic very much.
Yeah.
Marc...
Pau will make it.
You will see.
It's lucky that you help him.
I'm still getting the idea that you deceived me.
Mama, please.
If your father had seen what you did to me...
I don't even remember dad.
I do.
He's miles better than you.
He would never have done anything like this to me.
It's just an excuse so I can live with you.
You get me?
When dad died, I became very independent, but now with you, I feel accompanied again.
Like when we lived together in Paris.
Paris...
I have not dared to return.
It must have changed a lot.
We should go on vacation, right?
Back to where I was born.
Be born...
You know I met your father when I was going on tour around Spain.
Yes, and you got pregnant.
Then you came back to Paris and I was born.
Shut up.
Since you told me that you're living well with me, now my turn.
When the tour finished, your father and I decided to go to Paris, but I wasn't pregnant.
We argued.
Your father told me he would never lie to me, that he would always be honest with me.
But he had to tell me that...
A few months before that...
He had an affair with a woman.
A...
A young woman from Pigalle.
And that woman... was pregnant.
Dad had another child?
Don't you understand what I mean, Merlí?
That woman didn't want to take care of the child.
She wanted money.
And your father gave her a lot of money for her to give us the child, to forget about us... and about you.
But, Jesus!
What are you talking about, dammit?
What are you telling me?
Don't be mad, please.
But how can you expect me not to be mad?
- You're telling me you're not my mother?
- I'm not joking.
Since the moment I held you in my arm, you have always been my son.
And I have always shown you that.
Yes or no?
Yes, you have.
But you lied to me, dammit!
You were afraid of traumatizing me?
Merlí, I couldn't tell you that your mother was a whore.
Jesus!
A 16-year-old whore!
What are you saying?
Fuck!
Fuck!
Fucking fuck!
Damn!
It's a lie.
You made that up?
You're sick!
Climb up here and you'll see Canterbury.
Okay.
Yes.
I'll talk with the department and I'll tell you later.
Sorry.
Come in.
Yes.
Okay.
We'll stay like that.
Bye.
How are you, Gina?
I'm fine.
The AMPA meeting has just finished.
You didn't come.
No.
I had things to do.
Ah, I was surprised because you called me to summon the meeting and you didn't show up.
Yeah, but I was busy with other things.
Take this.
This is the list of the parents who ask about the dining hall.
Okay, thank you.
Are you okay, Toni?
Yes, I am.
I'm a little overwhelmed by classes ...
Something's wrong or...?
No, no.
Stuffs...
If you're not in hurry, shall we have coffee and...?
Well, you couldn't the other day...
Now?
What do you mean, Toni?
Me?
No, nothing.
Nothing.
Nothing?
You sure?
Sorry, maybe I'm wrong, but you give me the impression that you want to stay with me in a more personal way.
What are you saying?
No.
No, not now.
I'm not like Merlí.
What do you mean by this?
No, I don't have such confidence in myself.
I mean...
Do you think if I wanted to do something with you, would I tell you this like he does?
No, I'm more discreet.
Sorry.
Thanks for the list.
Toni, I don't want any tension between us.
No, Gina, please.
No tension.
None.
I'm leaving.
See you soon.
Gina!
- Have you talked with Toni?
- Yes.
If you want to find Merlí, I don't know where he is.
No, I think he has gone somewhere.
And you, Gloria?
How are you?
Well, I'm still living the widowhood.
It's hard to look at that room with no Santi.
Yeah.
No wonder.
The work helps me overcome it.
This is what he would have wanted.
Yes, surely.
How are you with Merlí?
Good.
I admit, when he first came here, I was taken aback a lot.
But over time, I've come to like him.
I think I've learned things from him.
Really?
Not to keep quiet about what I think.
Merlí will be the one you want, but he has this:
He's honest, frankly speaking.
And he says things to your face.
Yes.
For those who are close to him, I don't know if he's that good.
Ah, this is something else.
It's true that he is sure of himself.
I mean if someone has a problem with Merlí, he knows that there will always be others who will be fascinated with him.
Look at the students.
Yes.
I don't want to mess with where I'm not asked for.
You're a good match.
Thank you.
Bye.
You maybe think that you're discreet.
But it shows.
What?
You seek me, Toni.
Gina, please ...
You're with Merlí.
And how do you know the kind of relationship we have?
Let's go to my house.
Yeah.
Two euro tip.
It doesn't happen very often.
Your eyes are red.
The smoke extractor in the kitchen isn't working.
Again?
It breaks every now and then.
I have eye drops.
You haven't told me how your day was.
Ivan didn't tell you?
What?
Nothing.
Just nonsense.
No, tell me now.
No, it doesn't matter.
Some nonsense.
Nothing.
Just that Ivan skipped the philosophy class and Merlí went to look for him at the bar.
Oh yeah?
Yes.
He said he didn't want to teach without him.
But later they came back together and we continued the class as usual.
So Ivan played truant?
Yes, but don't tell him that.
Relax.
There, apply the eye drops.
Wait.
I'll do it.
Sit here.
Look at the ceiling.
It's has been so long since some one puts me the eye drops.
Now, the other.
Thank you.
I also played truant.
So many years ago.
Not so many.
You really should come to class.
Miriam...
What?
You doubt that?
I'm the school's bad boy.
I don't know what more to write.
What is it?
Your essay.
You did it?
Pau, if you want to pass, we have to be practical.
Cool.
I know this is not allowed, but I want you to pass.
But you have to promise me to turn in the homework the next day.
You will have to do it from the start.
I swear.
I made some mistakes so it can't be noticed.
I've tried to write with your words.
Look.
Read.
"I live in Barcelona with my parents and my brother Marc."
Good.
"My mother is the one who makes sandwich every morning."
"And when I was small, she took me to school."
"But now I'm in secondary, I go by myself."
You read it.
"My father is very friendly, always making jokes.
And on Saturdays, he bring us to cine and sometimes plays basketball or soccer."
Look at this.
"In Christmas, we always eat canneloni and my mother makes it really well."
"They give me many things."
"In summer, we go to Mallorca."
Mallorca?
"To Mallorca to dive."
"My parents are happy to go on vacations together."
"My father spends Sundays reading newspapers and my mom listening to music."
"And in the afternoons, we'll have snack together."
That's it.
What?
Cool.
Do you like it?
Yes.
But all of this are lies.
So what?
Are you sure you're not sleeping?
No.
I was talking on Skype.
With your boyfriend?
I'll leave if you want.
No.
We've talked for an hour.
What about you?
Me?
I like a woman.
She's a MILF.
She's 40.
No shit.
Really?
She's so hot, Bruno.
She has a mouth...
Who?
It's a woman who works in the supermarket under my house.
Right.
Supermarket.
She must not be Ivan's mother?
No, man, no.
What are you saying?
Pol.
I know you're working with her.
I don't buy that supermarket woman.
Fuck.
What?
Nothing, man.
She turns me on.
But it's impossible.
Pol, watch out.
If she wasn't Ivan's mother...
But...
Yeah, yeah.
It's impossible.
You'll have to endure.
Just like me because I have a boyfriend in Rome.
Why don't you go see him?
I'll go in Christmas.
My mother is there anyway.
And in the meantime...
I don't know.
Go flirting, right?
Bruno ...
What?
We're both horny.
Damn, you've become so confident.
Yes.
I'm out of the closet.
Does your boyfriend know that you're up to no good?
Who tells everything to their other half?
Better not, Bruno.
I don't want to play with you.
Too bad.
Because I want to play.
Damn, a Christmas tree.
Your mother told me you're up here.
Since I've made the effort... will you let me sit?
This tree must have been here for a long time.
Was it yours?
We don't make crib or any shit like that.
But you love these traditions.
Yes, and I go to church and confess my sins.
I figured you're an atheist.
Atheists spend all day talking about God.
Well, I would like to believe in God.
I do that in advance.
You don't have to be afraid of death.
If someone in your family dies, then think that it's because God wants it that way.
And don't you find it cruel that an almighty God wants these things?
I don't know.
What kind of divinity that decides to take small creatures, for example?
You know what Kant said?
It is necessary to believe in the existence of God, but it is not necessary to show that He exists.
I don't know why you came, if I'm not your friend.
Because...
You were right, Ivan.
What I did to my mother is cruel.
And I listened to you.
I told her the truth.
And now she lets me live with her.
I came to tell you this, because... besides being my pupil,
You also...
I consider you a friend.
I realized that I was fooling myself.
This sounds deep, doesn't it?
Fooling oneself is a very human lie.
Do you know what happens?
To reach a target, we often make many turns.
We lie as easily as we breathe.
And we do that instinctively, Ivan.
We need to hide, not to show, to lie.
In other cases, therefore, lying is pure survival.
Yes, it sounds radical, but for many people, a lie that makes you happy is better than a truth that hurts our lives.
I don't know.
For example,
What would happen if we didn't hide the infidelity?
The lies protect the couples.
Lies come first, because if we told the truth and only the truth wherever we go,
there would still be more wars there.
Look at this.
Don't you think that Christmas is a big lie?
Since he didn't give me the programming,
I called the Education Inspectors and they're coming today.
What?
I hope you'll have the work tomorrow.
Tomorrow?
Didn't you say you had it almost done?
I want an only-girl party.
Yes.
Okay!
I'm going to an only-girl party today.
Wouldn't we meet?
Today, the girls have party.
Ah, cool.
But If I were to decide, you know.
We can leave the party anytime.
Read, Roberta.
Seriously.
Her name is Berta.
Berta.
It's easy to say, right?
Ber-ta.
Girls!
We also have a crazy party tonight.
Who?
Us.
Who asked you?
I'm incorrigible, you know that.
I misbehave and I have duty.
It's time to talk about guys.
Well, Tania, you're virgin, right?
Listen, do you want me to take the shirt home?
I'll have it washed.
It's dirty.
No, leave it there.
I'll wash it.
My hero!
You are the winner!
Oh!
He shoots, he scores.
Come on!
Black Knight strikes again!
Jack?
When is this gonna get cleaned up?
Mm.
You know, people are coming to see the house.
I'm doing homework.
- Homework?
- Yeah, homework.
You think I'm clueless?
No, I'm working on that.
- Homework...
- I've never seen that before.
What, me, operate a computer?
Hey, I don't mean to put pressure on you, sweetie, but you really gotta do great at school.
'Cause, at this point, I...
I just...
I can't afford college.
You gotta get a scholarship.
Is nothing selling?
Six months.
Not a house, not an apartment.
Hey, Mr. Chang says everything happens for a reason.
Yes, you know what?
Well, Mr. Chang is not getting his home foreclosed on in 90 days.
I'm sorry.
I know he's your friend, and it's really sweet of him to give you a job and everything, but...
We don't need philosophy.
We need a break.
Hey... how's it going with Travis and them?
Oh, that's fine.
- No more bullying?
- I just told you.
Okay.
- I love you.
- Love you too.
- No more gaming.
- Mm.
- Until you finish your homework.
- Is that a threat?
Yeah.
lam Octoman!
Hector, you dork.
- An octopus has eight arms.
- Whatever!
II
Look who's here.
Watch this, dork!
- Oh, no, Travis.
- Whoo!
Whoo!
You like that?
You like that?
Whom!
You like that, huh?
Bye-bye.
Get out of the way!
Hey, Travis, you're all right there?
Oh, gosh, I'm really sorry.
How many times I gotta tell you?
This is our spot!
You said the park on Magnolia was your spot.
You didn't... you didn't say anything about this.
Any place there's a ramp, that's ours.
You almost killed me, twerp!
I'm sorry, okay'?
It was an accident!
Accident or not...
I'm still gonna kick your butt.
Ah!
You're not getting away that easy!
What are you waiting for?
Let's go!
Gotta move, boys!
Come on!
Let's go, boys!
Let's go, boys!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Get out of the way, wrinkles!
Watch it!
Let's go to the left!
Whoa!
Car, car, car, car!
Look out!
SorFY, ma'am!
Okay.
No, no, no!
Argh!
Come on, come on!
Hurry up, hurry up!
No, no, no, no!
Oh, move!
Move, what are you doing?
What, you going to a frat party?
- Move, get out of the way!
- Where'd he go?
What's your problem?
Trouble again?
You mean trouble still.
You should use some of those moves from your game, Jack.
Kick some butt.
That's the gaming world, Mr. Chang.
This is the real world.
One's got nothing to do with the other.
- Bravery is bravery.
- Look at me.
Do I even look like I have one ounce of brave in me?
Looking and being are two different things, young Jack.
Not in this case.
Here, it's what you see is what you get.
Well, let's see if I can get some work out of my employee.
Okay.
How are things at home?
Eh, Mom's worried about money.
The real estate market's dead.
She hasn't sold anything in months.
Looks like we're gonna have to move.
I wish I could do something to help her out, invent a cool app or something.
What's all this?
It's a new shipment from my cousin in Beijing.
Help me open it.
II.
Mr. Chang, what's this?
This has been in my family since forever.
You like it?
Yeah.
I do.
The Dancing Princess.
Yeah, looks like she's breaking.
You know, like...
See?
Look.
I don't think so, young Jack.
She lived a long, long time ago.
She saved her country from the Barbarians.
Talk about brave.
She was brave.
This little girl can kick butt, big time.
Where do I put it?
How about your house?
What do you mean?
I mean, a present.
- No, Mr. Chang, I can't.
- Oh, sure you can.
You watch the shop while I go on vacation.
But you're already overpaying me for that.
Bad manners to refuse a gift.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- Hey, so I have an idea.
- Mm.
This house... really kinda too big for the both of us.
I mean, when Dad was here, fine.
But now, you know, maybe we should think about renting a room out, you know, to some kid from the university or something.
What did I do to deserve a kid like you?
Win the lottery?
Good night.
II
What?
Where is the Black Knight?
I'm the Black Knight!
You lie, you die!
Black Knight!
It's Octoman!
- Hey, wait, wait!
- I challenge you to a duel to the death!
It's a video game!
It's a video game!
Okay?
I just want to show you, man.
I have eight arms now, bro!
Okay, see?
That's the challenger.
And that's me, the Black Knight.
Yeah.
It's me.
Look, when I move... he moves.
Fight!
You are the winner!
Just you wait man, I'm gonna come back with twelve arms.
So you are the Black Knight?
In the game world, I'm the Black Knight.
In this world, I'm Jack Bronson.
Jack Bronson is worthless to me.
Jack Bronson, I need your help.
For what?
I need you to guard the most precious treasure of the empire.
Excuse me?
The Princess and future Empress.
Oh...
Hi.
I'm Jack...
Anyone who touches the princess dies!
That is the rule.
No exceptions?
There is no point of having a rule if you have an exception.
Sometimes it's good to be a little flexible.
If anything happens to her...
II
I am hallucinating.
This is crazy.
This isn't happening, this isn't happening.
- Where are your weapons?
- My weapons?
Warrior Zhao said you were going to protect me.
To protect me you need to have skills.
And weapons.
Okay, you know, I think Warrior Zhao is a little confused 'cause...
I'm not the Black Knight.
I don't have skills, or weapons.
So Warrior Zhao was right.
You are worthless.
Okay, you know what, can we start over?
I'm Jack.
- What do I call you?
- Your Highness.
I meant your name.
- Sulin.
- Okay.
I'm hungry, Jack.
Bring me swallow nest soup.
Mm, roasted snail, the big kind.
Oh, and duck tongues in hot chili sauce.
Mm.
I'll see what I can do.
Not bad.
II
Oh, no!
Oh!
Oh, no!
Sulin?
No, no, no, no.
Hey.
Just in time.
Hey, how did you sleep?
Great.
How did you sleep?
Fine.
Do you want to sit down?
Um... no, no, urn... because I read that it's better for digestion if you stand.
I never heard that.
Um, okay, I'm gonna do the dishes.
No, no, I'll do it, Mom.
Leave it, Mom, I'll do the dishes today.
Excuse me, what?
You have to go to work.
The bridge is down, there's traffic.
- You're gonna be late.
- The bridge?
Yeah, you've gotta go, you're gonna be late.
- I need my...
- Here's the bag, keys, phone...
Hey, I'm going to see aunt Sophie tomorrow.
Do you want to come with?
Uh, no, I've got a lot of stuff to do, like homework.
- Okay.
- Yeah, okay, bye.
Okay, you gotta come inside!
Hey!
I'm not joking!
Okay, just stay here.
Don't move!
What up, man?
So h0w'd you like my octopus, bro?
Mm, lame.
Damn, it's a prototype, yo.
Just gimme some time, I'll be killin' it.
- Eight arms and stuff.
- Hello?
- Hello.
- Whoa.
You gonna intro me, bro?
Uh.
This is Hector.
- Octoman, yo.
- Octoman.
This is...
Her Highness.
Really?
That's her name?
Yeah, that's it.
Well, pound it out, Your Highness.
* No!
'
Oh, dude, I'm so sorry.
' ' Are YOU okay?
Yeah, it's cool, man.
I got seven more, you know.
So what's the story here?
It's complicated, and I don't really want to talk about it right now.
You know what I mean?
Dude, the girl is... whoa!
You gonna hook up?
Not if you keep asking stupid questions like that.
- You tell me all about it, though, right?
- Every last detail.
Right, catch you two lovebirds later.
- You can't do that!
- He want to hit me.
No, he went to fistbump you.
It's a greeting, like a handshake.
Didn't you hear Warrior Zhao?
Never touch a princess.
You can get your head chopped off.
That's the rule.
Okay, maybe where you come from, that's the rule.
But here?
Here the rules are different.
When you go back to your world, you can chop off as many heads as you want, I promise.
But here, my world, my rules.
"Okay?" Okay,
No!
What are you doing?
Observing your world, so I can learn the rules better.
No, no, no, no, you have to go back inside.
How am I going to learn the rules of your world if I don't see it?
Well, you can't go out dressed like that.
- Why not?
- Because...
Because people will stare and wonder what the heck's going on.
If I was dressed differently could I stand here?
Yes!
Then call the tailor and have him make me new clothes.
Uh, we don't get our clothes from a tailor.
Then take me where you do.
These are men's.
Hey, hey, hey.
II.
- Are you okay?
- What's that?
That's ice cream.
It's food.
What does it taste like?
Well, first it's cold, then it's sweet.
Mm.
I want one.
Okay, well, what flavor do you want?
They have chocolate, vanilla, strawberry, cherry, mint chip...
Mm, I want all of them.
All of them?
Okay.
Okay.
- Girl, you the shit.
- Hey, hey, hey.
Here's your ice cream.
We gotta go.
- That was fun!
- Yeah.
It was.
I like the mall, Jack.
Thank you for bringing me here.
You're welcome.
What did he mean, I'm "the shit?"
Uh, well, when you really like something,
- that's what you say.
- Mm.
Hi, Mom.
Uh, hello.
I had ice cream.
- Yeah, I can see that.
- Um...
Do you wanna...
Mom, I forgot to tell you.
Um...
The other day in school they asked someone to volunteer to take an exchange student.
And Sulin showed up today.
Uh, you fresh off the boat, huh?
No boat.
I came by box.
- What?
- Uh, she meant plane.
Plane, because box and plane are the same in her language.
What's the plane?
- She does this all the time.
- I thought she just got here?
- She did.
- But you just said all the time.
I did.
Um...
I meant that in the time that she's been here.
Are you okay with this?
- Yeah, I mean...
- Uh, no, no, no, no.
Sulin, it is so nice to meet you.
Um, I'm Jack's Mom.
I'm Annie.
Um, I'm so... hungry.
Um, sure, we have salad, and fresh corn and... hamburgers.
Sulin, do you like hamburgers?
I like snails.
Like Jack made me last night.
Last night?
In the Chinese grammar, they get their past and future tenses
- mixed up a lot.
- Mm.
Um...
You know you're acting very weird.
Why don't you put the burgers on?
Sulin and I will go make up the couch in the guest room for her.
Okay, I'm gonna be gone tomorrow but maybe when I get back, we can, um... get to know each other a little better.
Maybe we can go to the mall.
It's the shit!
- Who told you that?
- Jack.
Okay, this is where you're gonna be sleeping.
Hector over compute" She said that?
To my Mom.
That is ill, dude.
Hector, gimme a break.
I don't know, man, the girl is hot, yo.
Good night, Hector.
Excuse me...
The bed next door...
it's in the wrong position.
Very bad feng shui.
I can't sleep.
Huh.
Hmm.
This one is good feng shui.
II.
Ooh!
Don't forget to clean the house.
Oh, don't worry.
You won't recognize the place when you get back.
- Yeah?
Sure.
- Say hey to Aunt Sophie.
Where is she?
Who the hell are you?
- Where is the princess?
- Look, man, I don't know, okay?
I'm here.
Whoa!
Stay back!
Oh, no, no, no!
Jack!
Please help me!
Help!
Jack!
Jack!
Jack!
Jack!
Jack!
Jack!
Jack!
Jack!
Jack!
Jack!
Jack!
Jack!
Come on!
Help!
Help!
Jack!
Okay.
I told you not to let her out of your sight!
You are worthless!
I'm not a warrior!
I don't know what you were expecting!
I was expecting more.
Okay.
Well, how about this for more?
When I saw she was taken by those...
whatever the hell those were, ljumped right in after her, man, okay?
How much more can you want?
And by the way, we came the same way, seconds apart.
- She should be here.
- She's not.
- Where is she then?
- I don't know.
How can you not know?
I was right behind her.
I was busy.
Well, maybe she came in and ran out.
- She's probably right outside.
- Wait, don't!
Oops.
Okay.
Okay.
I don't want you to think I'm ducking out on you, 'cause I'm not, but, you know, I got a lot of homework to do and I should be getting back by now.
Just go back to where I came.
It's not going to happen.
So I'm stuck here?
There's no other way out?
I didn't say that.
I'm not in charge of transportation.
- Well, who is?
- The Wizard is.
And where is the Wizard?
Jack Bronson!
I wouldn't do that.
Wake up!
Stop!
Never wake a sleeping Wizard.
Why?
I'll get my head chopped off?
Yes, how did you know?
Lucky guess.
What is it with you people and chopping off heads?
I mean, really.
It's effective.
Close the door!
Cut the rope!
Hmm.
Mm.
Hmm.
Get behind me!
Open the door!
There's like thousands of...
Just open it.
Okay...
Oh, sorry.
Hello.
What is your name, young man?
Jack.
Oh, Jack.
Welcome, Jack!
Is something wrong?
No, it's just you look a lot like someone I know.
Is he handsome?
Mm?
Mm?
Yes.
Okay, now let's go find the princess.
- Can you explain something to me?
- If I can.
- Well, let's start with the chest.
- The Warrior's Gate.
That's the real name.
- How does it work?
- That's complicated.
Ah, it has to do with time, space, magic and things beyond explaining.
The main thing is that it works.
- Then how do I get back?
- Another chest.
There's another chest?
- Great, where is it?
- Well, that is complicated.
I have to collect four different woods from four different trees that grow in four different parts of the country.
North... where zebrawood is found.
South, where the spotted bamboo grows.
East, where the black mahogany lives.
And west, where the rarest tree in all the land is found.
That's the only way to build a new box.
But first, let's find the princess.
- You know where she is?
- Oh, another complicated question.
How about an easy one, huh?
- Zhao.
Tell me about Zhao.
- That's easy.
Warrior Zhao was one of the seven companions raised from birth by the sacred monks for one thing and one thing only:
To protect the Emperor.
The monks trained the seven companions day and night, year in and year out, until they were the most invincible force.
It was their sole purpose in life to protect the Emperor while he brought peace to the land.
There was not a man alive who could defeat them... except one.
Arun The Cruel, King of Barbarians.
As fate would have it,
Zhao was on a mission and late for dinner.
The food had been poisoned.
Fearing the worst, he rushed to protect the Emperor.
But he arrived too late.
And then, chaos descended from the North.
And the peace the Emperor had worked so hard to build began to fall apart.
With no leader, the army was lost, the people were lost.
Zhao fought relentlessly, but as great a warrior as he was, he needed the help of the greatest warrior that could be found.
And so, by using the Seeing Stone,
- I found you.
- Yes!
And he passed through the Warrior's Gate to get help protecting the greatest treasure we possess.
- Sulin.
- Sulin.
The only one who can rally the people to defeat the Barbarians and save our kingdom.
But I'm not going to be able to help him.
- He thinks I'm worthless.
- Oh, yes, he might, but I don't.
- Based on what?
- You are here.
You didn't have to be.
You could have stayed home.
That says something about who you are.
That I'm crazy.
Hmm.
And now if you will excuse me, I have a lot of wood to collect.
See you, bye-bye-
Come on, let's go!
II.
You know the old saying about blaming the bearer of bad news?
Yes, Your Highness.
- Do you believe it's true?
- I hope not, Your Highness.
Good news.
I'm getting married!
Bad news.
Warrior Zhao is on his way.
Kill him.
Brutus!
Not him!
Kill Zha0!
Oops.
- So I assume you have a plan.
- I do.
Save the princess.
Prevent her marriage.
Wait, she's getting married?
Forced to.
Unless we stop it.
Uh, who's the groom?
Arun The Cruel.
That's his name?
His full name is Arun The Cruel, The Horrible,
The Terrible, The Miserable, but we keep it short.
If the marriage takes place, when she becomes Empress, he becomes Emperor.
And once he's Emperor, he will kill her, and the whole country is doomed.
- Are you finished with dinner?
- I guess.
Now we sleep.
Hey, I know we're roughing it, but do we have any blankets and pillows?
Blankets, no.
Pillow...
Yes.
II
Good night.
Okay, say we rescue the princess.
Does she have anyone else in mind to marry'?
Not yet.
Any idea what kind of husband she's looking for?
Cause in the little time that we spent together, you know, I...
I felt that we had something, you know?
A connection.
'Cause we like the same clothes, we like the same music.
- You don't... you don't think that...
- No, I don't think, Jack Bronson.
She's looking for someone good, someone brave, a hero.
Yeah.
Seized in the raid of the capital of Ching Hai province.
1,600 bricks of silver.
1,800 bricks of gold.
Six chests of diamonds and 26 slaves.
- Only 26 slaves?
- Yes, I know.
We're underperforming in that department.
Who's in charge of slaves?
My cousin.
Get rid of him.
Brutus!
I meant the cousin, not him!
Oops...
Let's take a moment here, big fella.
Now, I know you want to please me.
But, next time, before you kill someone, should we have a signal, maybe?
Like something like that?
Like a signal?
Like that, a signal like that.
- Like that?
- Kill him.
- Yes.
Yes.
- Yes.
That signal.
That's the signal.
Your Highness!
Finally, my beautiful bride has arrived.
Hello, my love!
How are you?
Tired from your long trip?
In need of a hot bath?
A home-cooked meal maybe?
Soon, my love.
Soon.
You and me.
You and me.
Call the tailor for a fitting.
II.
What are you doing?
It's gonna rain.
Mm.
There's no clouds.
Not all rain comes from clouds.
Oh.
My God!
Ah!
Oh, my God, it's raining!
The hell is going on?
- He wants me dead.
- So they know we're here?
They know we're somewhere around here, so they just keep shooting arrows everywhere and hope to get lucky.
We call it the morning shower.
Why didn't you wake me up?
I could have been dead.
If I wanted you dead, I'd do it myself.
You have to learn to listen.
- What does it say?
- "Do not enter".
What's in there?
The Unknown Lands.
And what's in the Unknown Lands?
Unknown things.
Okay, wait, but...
You are dropping me off at the Wizard's, right?
- Wrong.
- Okay, look.
I really think it's about time we thought about getting me home.
So do I. Here.
- What's this?
- A map.
It'll take you to the Wizard.
I can't...
I can't read this!
I just want to go home and you're not helping.
I gave you a map.
Okay, so basically it's "get lost, Jack," huh?
"I brought you here against your will.
I kidnapped you!"
And now that you are not the person I thought you were, it's 'Adiés, amigo, you are not my problem."'
Wrong on number one.
I did not kidnap you.
No one made you jump into that chest.
Right on number two.
You are not my problem.
My problem is to get through the Unknown Lands.
Get past Arun's army, past his personal guard, past the tower guards, find the Princess, get past the tower reinforcements, past the personal guard reinforcements,
- kill Arun...
- Hello.
And then bring the Princess back, so she can be made Empress, and save the country.
That is my problem.
So you're saying I don't have a choice.
You do have a choice.
You can save yourself, or you can save her.
I can't save a princess!
You're the Black Knight!
- Oh, yeah, I almost forgot.
- Sire!
Sire!
Sire!
Good news!
Don't be nervous.
It's been my lucky day so far.
I have a good feeling about this one.
I'm glad, Sire.
I'm sure it's good news.
Bad news.
"There is no sign of the Warrior Zhao."
Sire, Sire...
Brutus...
The signal.
Remember the signal?
- The signal?
- Kill him!
You know, I was thinking.
This Arun dude, maybe if he gets what he wants, he'll change.
You know?
Be like, Arun The Kind?
Do you have people in your world who get what they want by threatening to do bad things?
There's this one kid.
And when you give him what he wants, does he change?
Not really.
"Might" does not make right, Jack.
Right makes right.
If you don't stand up for what is right, then why stand up at all?
That's easy to say.
This kid, he's bigger than me, he's stronger than me.
So what do you do?
I run.
Does that solve your problem?
No.
II
- 3° You got a girl?
- No.
- Because?
- Because I have my job.
What, your job doesn't leave time for a personal life?
My job is my life.
That doesn't sound like much fun.
Fun?
Yeah, you know?
Doing things that make you feel good.
I feel good doing my job.
You gotta loosen up, dude.
Come on.
Ever seen this before?
No?
Okay, look.
It's called dancing, okay?
It's like, uh...
No?
Okay, try these on.
Mm-mm.
Just stay still, or I'll poke your eye out.
There you go.
- Magic!
- It's cool.
Okay, I'm gonna lay down a beat and you just move your hips, okay?
I don't have time for fun.
Man, come on.
Come on, we don't have all day.
Ooh.
Wow.
Excuse me, but we have to get through.
And I need to finish cooking my soup.
How long is that going to take?
Hmm.
All night.
We don't...
we don't have all night.
You do now.
Perhaps if we moved the pot...
Hey, hey, hey!
Respect your elders, boy!
No disrespect, but we have a very important mission and we have to get through.
Well, your very important mission will have to wait!
To wait... to wait... to wait...
For my potatoes to soften.
I'm sorry.
- It can't.
- No!
Over here!
Here!
Whoa!
Help me up!
Now!
Come on, Jack.
Come on.
I did not sign up for this!
Not fire!
I hate fire!
Maybe not so worthless after all.
You're welcome.
My bride.
I hope you like your new palace.
And in two days' time, you will take your place next to me.
Of course, your throne will be...
- much lower.
- I would rather die.
Whatever makes you happy, my dear.
You want to see me happy, huh?
Just tell me what I need to do, and it will be done.
Well...
Come close.
And I will whisper it in your ear.
Tell me, my love, my sweet songbird, what do I need to do to make you happy?
Die.
As much as I'd like to make you happy, me dying is not on the agenda.
However, if you insist on someone dying, it can be arranged.
Take her away!
Your dinner.
Get out!
II
Invisible women, powder that freezes people in place, boxes that time-travel, and none of this is weird to you, is it?
It's not weird.
It's just magic.
We don't have magic.
Then how do you explain what cannot be explained?
We have science.
Science explains everything.
Does science explain a rainbow or a snowflake?
- Yes.
- But does it explain how you feel when you see the rainbow or the snowflake?
- No.
- So you do have magic.
- Feelings aren't magic.
- What are they then?
I don't know, they're feelings.
Okay?
They make you do and say things you normally wouldn't do or say, like, if you met this girl you never knew, and all of a sudden, there's...
You can't think of anything to say, but you can't stop talking.
And your body is, like, hot and cold at the same time, and your heart is beating like you just ran a mile in a minute,
- and it's... it's like...
- Magic?
Yeah, I guess.
II
Zhao, I've got the wood!
Sorry it took so long, I got lost.
Hey, since we seem to be getting in trouble all the time, maybe it could be good if you showed me a few moves.
Just in case.
Martial arts take many years to learn.
No, I'm not asking for the whole menu.
Just a little something.
Martial arts do not work with a little something.
Well, then, a lot of something.
Anything.
Even if I can do one thing to help out the next time we're in a situation.
Just give me something so I have a fighting chance.
Please.
Come on.
Come on.
Get up.
Stand feet apart.
Uh, this is cool.
Bend your knees.
Sorry.
Okay.
Now imagine there is a big tree in front of you.
You see it?
- Yeah.
- Is it big?
Yeah.
Okay, now... hug it.
Do what?
I mean, hug the tree.
Good.
- That's it?
- That's it.
Well, how long do I have to stay like this?
Mm!
You know, if you're not going to teach me, you should just say so.
- I am teaching you.
- Yeah, right.
Thanks.
Thanks a lot.
Hey.
Hey, wait, what are you doing?
Come on.
Now pay attention.
The secret of all martial arts is the circle.
When you move, the circle moves with you.
Here.
Let me show you.
Hit me.
Hit me again.
Again.
To understand the circle, you must make the circle.
Live the circle, until the circle is you, and you are the circle.
Understand?
We move the moment she says "I do."
The first army, directly for the capital.
The second army, to the ocean.
And the third army?
- We have a third army?
- Yes.
Just let them rob and pillage.
Excuse me, Sire.
For the wedding canopy, red or blue?
Red or blue, my love?
Oops.
And this is called not good.
Why?
It's beautiful.
Yes, it is, but the fortress is over there, and it could take days to walk all the way around the lake.
Well, we could just swim across in no time.
No, Jack, it's not possible.
- Why?
Are there man-eating fish in there?
- No.
- Poisonous snakes?
- No.
- Dragons?
- Not this time of year.
So what's in there that's a problem?
I cannot swim.
You're kidding me?
You... you... you, who can kick the butts of the entire NFL at the same time, and you can't swim?
What's wrong with this picture?
They never taught...
- Oh, come on, where are you going?
- There's no time to waste.
- You're gonna walk?
- We don't have a choice.
Okay, you gotta get over this "you don't have a choice" thing, all right?
You do have a choice.
You're strong and you're coordinated.
Maybe we can work something out.
Okay?
I teach you to swim, you teach me more...
Deal?
Come on.
- Oh!
- You can do it.
You can do it, man, come on.
Trust me.
Hey, that's it.
There you go.
Now, put the shield down...
And hop on!
Hey!
There you go.
- You're having fun?
- Yeah.
I bet you didn't get too much of that growing up the way you did.
Fun?
No.
Well, when this is all over, you can make up for that.
Maybe you can come visit me.
I'll show you around, maybe get my Mom to take us to Disneyland or something.
I told you, I can never take off from my job.
Hey, man, look, you really got to get a life.
When you are responsible for a life, you don't have a life.
Okay.
Did you... did you, like, go to school to learn how to say things like that?
Like what?
"When you are responsible for a life", you don't have a life."
What's wrong with it?
Nothing's wrong with it, it just... sounds smart.
It does?
Yeah.
It does.
II
So what's in Disneyland?
- A lot of princesses.
- Oh!
- A Chinese one too.
- Ooh!
Get down, get down, get down!
- So you do have a plan, right?
- I told you the plan.
- Ah, right.
Get past the army.
- Yes.
- Get past the personal guards.
- Correct.
Get past the tower guards, find the princess,
- get past reinforcements.
- Good.
- Kill Arun.
- Exactly.
Crown Sulin Empress and save the country?
You're learning to listen.
Yeah, the real question is, do you have a plan to execute the plan?
Hmm?
- Good morning!
- Mm?
Uh...
Great plan.
- Are we in the fortress?
- Yeah.
- Are we past the army?
- Yeah.
Have we passed the personal guards?
Almost.
Well, then I think that the plan is working.
I think the plan to get in is working.
How about a plan to get out?
I'm working on it.
Warrior Zhao,
I'm so honored that you've come all this way to attend my wedding.
I'm not here to attend your wedding.
I'm here to attend your funeral.
- And you are?
- He's the Black Knight.
I'm not the Black Knight, okay?
I'm Jack Bronson.
Jack Bronson...
I've got good news.
And I've got bad news.
The good news is, tomorrow, when my bride and I are married, we will stand, there.
And you two, will stand... there.
Okay.
What's the bad news?
As soon as we take our vows, and our new life begins...
Your life ends.
II.
- He's not bluffing, is he?
- Arun doesn't do bluffs.
Maybe he'll be feeling generous on his wedding day and he'll pardon us.
Nun doesn't do generous.
Okay.
If he doesn't do this and he doesn't do that, is there anything that he does do?
- He murders and pillages.
- So in other words, we're dead.
When one door closes, another one opens.
See?
Dinner is served.
It's time to eat.
Uh... excuse me.
Uh, would you mind... you know, so we can...
Thank you.
Here.
Dudes, I'm looking for the princess.
Know where she is?
What now?
Now's the time to use what I've taught you.
- I'm not ready.
- Of course you are.
You're the Black Knight.
You have skills.
Okay.
I don't...
I don't get it.
'Cause one minute you're telling me I'm worthless and after a few lessons, I'm not?
It's not just me who thinks you are not worthless, Jack.
The way the princess looks at you?
She believes in you.
- She does?
- Now go rescue her.
Go!
' What's up?
Huh?
II
Jack.
Jack.
Are you okay?
I'm sorry.
You came to save me!
I guess.
I knew you would.
You did?
From the very first.
Great plan, we did it.
Um... how do we get out of here?
I'm working on it.
You better work fast.
They're coming.
How many?
I don't know. 25?
I need to know exactly how many.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten... 13,14,15... 27, 28, 29, 30!
Thirty?
Thirty!
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.
- Thirty-one!
- 31!
31!
26, 27, 28, 29, 30...
That worked.
Why do you still have this on?
I like it.
Come on, get on.
Go!
Are you on?
- Are you on?
Get on, then!
- No, I'm not.
- Let's go!
- Come on!
Almost there!
"Yam
Come on.
Amazing animals.
Raised each and every one of them from birth.
Fed by my hand only.
Nursed them when they were sick.
They are more loyal than all my men.
They would die for me.
As will the two of you.
And you, my dear, by this time tomorrow, you and I will be husband and wife.
Emperor, and Empress.
Allow me, my love.
Take them away.
- What are they doing?
- Ancient custom.
Last look.
Last meal.
So you know what you're missing.
Okay.
- How can you eat?
- I'm hungry.
They're gonna kill us!
You should try it, it's actually pretty good.
I don't care if it's the best food in the world, man!
I'm Still a kid!
I got my whole life ahead of me.
Now there's a million things that I'm never gonna be able to do!
Like what?
Dude, I've never even kissed a girl!
Me neither.
You know, I was that close before you came in the room.
Yeah... but that's not the point.
- With the princess?
How close?
- That's not the point.
- What was that?
- A butterfly.
- You spoke to a butterfly?
- Apparently.
And it understood you?
Hopefully.
II
We are gathered here today to witness the marriage of Arun The Cruel,
The Mean, The Horrible,
The Terrible...
The Strong!
Can we move it along?
Uh...
Hey.
I, uh...
I wanted to say thank you.
For what?
For trying to turn me into a warrior.
You were a warrior from the beginning, Jack, on the inside.
It just had to be brought out.
Yeah, a lot of good it did.
It's not over yet.
What do you mean, it's not over yet?
In a minute, she's gonna be married, and we're gonna be hanged.
Jack, worrying is not gonna change anything.
Just live in the moment.
No offense, but I think we've run out of moments.
Do you, Arun, take Sulin, in sickness and in health,
- for better and worse...
- I do.
She does.
"I now pronounce you man and wife."
Uh... uh...
To make it official, you must now kiss the bride.
Hello!
Wizard!
Wait, how did you get here?
Shh!
See?
It's simple!
Now just go save her!
Great, urn, how?
Jump!
Jump?
'
Come on, man.
- Jack!
Jack!
- Use a little jump powder.
Come on.
Here you go.
- Now jump!
- Jump how?
- Now!
- What do you mean, now?
These powders are Wizard-specific!
You can do it, Jack!
~ Jump!
' Okay!
Come on!
That way!
Sulin!
Whoa!
Would you stop that, please?
It's a total buzzkill!
Okay, come on!
Let's go!
Now!
Get back!
Get back!
Jack, here.
Hey, wait, wait, wait,
- I don't know how to read these.
- Just throw!
Oh.
Nice.
Huh?
Huh?
Go save the princess!
Come on, let's go!
Come on!
Oh, Jack!
Zhao!
Huh?
It's time to go.
Sulin?
Sulin!
Sulin!
Sulin!
Jack.
- Jack...
- Are you okay?
Hold on.
Hold on.
Almost there.
But not quite.
Why are you doing this?
You're not a warrior.
Not even a grown man.
Run along.
And I'll let you live.
You run along and I'll let you live.
Let me think about it.
No.
I think I'll stay, I think I'll take one leg.
Take your other leg.
Then I'll take your arms.
No.
I'll just kill you.
' ~
Jack!
Jack!
You're the shit.
Thanks.
II
II
Hey, Zhao!
The Empress requests your presence.
Okay, I'm just waiting on the Wizard.
Jack, if the Empress summons you, you must come at once.
He said he'd be right back.
It is the rule.
Or what, huh?
I get my head chopped off?
You guys and your rules, man.
It's also against the rules to smile?
- Hi.
- Hey.
Wow.
What, sure I'm not gonna get my head chopped off?
There's no one here to see.
Okay.
I wanted to see you before you went back.
Actually, I wish I could go with you, even for one day.
You are the Empress now, you can do whatever you want.
Because I'm the Empress, I can't.
Every minute of every day from now on will be filled with ministers and ambassadors, and papers to sign and decisions to make.
No dancing, no singing.
No fun.
I would love to go to the mall, to eat ice cream.
But I...
I can't.
My father worked so hard to bring peace to the whole country.
I can't let him down.
He gave his life for our people.
I owe it to him.
I understand.
But I did want to thank you for giving me memories that I will always treasure.
I want to give you one I hope you will too.
II
I don't think you're worthless.
I never did.
Goodbye, Jack.
He touched the Empress!
He must die!
Wizard?
Wizard!
I'm here!
- I gotta go!
- Got it!
No, I gotta go now!
I gotta go!
I know.
I put it somewhere.
"L ' Yes!
You see?
Okay!
It's not ready, man?
Come on!
Hurry!
- Relax.
- Jack!
So, after all we've been through, you're gonna kill me?
Really?
Rules are rules.
If we did not live by them, we'd be nothing more than barbarians.
II.
Unless we can make an exception.
Sometimes it's good to be a little flexible, right?
I hate you.
Here.
Thank you.
Goodbye, Jack Bronson.
I will never forget you and the lesson you taught me.
It's done.
The last missing piece of wood.
I might have learned to be flexible, but they haven't.
- ' HUFW up, let's go.
- Yes!
- Come on, man.
Get it in!
- Let's go!
Hurry up!
Come on!
Jack!
Hi, Mom.
What... what happened here?
It's complicated.
Mm.
I'm sure it is.
Hello, dickweed.
Come on, Travis, I'm gonna be late for class.
You're gonna be late... permanently.
It doesn't have to be this way.
You're right.
It doesn't.
You could... run.
Yeah, nice.
You tell him, man.
Coward.
Okay.
I gave you the option.
You gave me the option?
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
You wanna dance?
Let's get this over with.
- Oh, man.
- Dickweed.
A-hole!
You all right, man?
- You done?
- You're dead!
Don't touch me!
You had enough?
- You all right?
- You all right, man?
Hey, come on, man.
Come on.
- Come on, get up!
Get up!
- Don't touch me!
II
What you doin'?
Sweetie, we have to move.
I couldn't make the payment.
We're losing the house.
No, we're not.
- Um, it's a check!
- Yeah.
- For $25,000.
- Yeah.
- It's made out to you?
- Yeah.
I don't understand.
Well, I, um...
I came up with the idea for a game.
And I sold it.
- Wait, you're kidding.
- No.
Ah, I'm sorry, I have to sit down.
A video game?
What's it called?
Uh, The Warrior's Gate.
- The Wa...
- Oh, come on!
II
- I'll have a chocolate cone, please.
- Uh, I'll have chocolate too.
And vanilla, and cherry, and strawberry.
Hi.
- What are you...
- Doing here?
- Uh...
- I've made a new rule.
Everyone takes vacation.
Even the Empress.
Very modern, huh?
Wait, how did you...
- Get here?
- Yeah.
I had the Wizard make another box.
Oh!
This is... this is so awesome!

That's the gaming world, Mr. Chang.
This is the real world.
One's got nothing to do with the other.
- Bravery is bravery.
- Look at me.
Do I even look like I have one ounce of brave in me?
Looking and being are two different things, young Jack.
Not in this case.
Here, it's what you see is what you get.
Well, let's see if I can get some work out of my employee.
Okay.
How are things at home?
Eh, Mom's worried about money.
The real estate market's dead.
She hasn't sold anything in months.
Looks like we're gonna have to move.
I wish I could do something to help her out, invent a cool app or something.
What's all this?
It's a new shipment from my cousin in Beijing.
Help me open it.
Mr. Chang, what's this?
This has been in my family since forever.
You like it?
Yeah.
I do.
The Dancing Princess.
Yeah, looks like she's breaking.
- You know, like...
- (LAUGHS)
See?
Look.
I don't think so, young Jack.
She lived a long, long time ago.
She saved her country from the Barbarians.
Talk about brave.
She was brave.
This little girl can kick butt, big time.
Where do I put it?
How about your house?
What do you mean?
I mean, a present.
- No, Mr. Chang, I can't.
- Oh, sure you can.
You watch the shop while I go on vacation.
But you're already overpaying me for that.
Bad manners to refuse a gift.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- JACK:
Hey, so I have an idea.
- ANNIE:
Mm.
This house... really kinda too big for the both of us.
I mean, when Dad was here, fine.
But now, you know, maybe we should think about renting a room out, you know, to some kid from the university or something.

For what?
I need you to guard the most precious treasure of the empire.
Excuse me?
(SPEAKING MANDARIN)
The Princess and future Empress.
Oh...
Hi.
I'm Jack...
Anyone who touches the princess dies!
That is the rule.
No exceptions?
There is no point of having a rule if you have an exception.
Sometimes it's good to be a little flexible.
(SPEAKING MANDARIN)
If anything happens to her...
(STAMMERS) I am hallucinating.
This is crazy.
This isn't happening, this isn't happening.
- Where are your weapons?
- My weapons?
Warrior Zhao said you were going to protect me.
To protect me you need to have skills.
And weapons.
Okay, you know, I think Warrior Zhao is a little confused 'cause...
I'm not the Black Knight.
I don't have skills, or weapons.
So Warrior Zhao was right.
You are worthless.
Okay, you know what, can we start over?
I'm Jack.
- What do I call you?
- Your Highness.
I meant your name.
- Sulin.
- Okay.
I'm hungry, Jack.
Bring me swallow nest soup.
Mm, roasted snail, the big kind.
Oh, and duck tongues in hot chili sauce.
Mm.
I'll see what I can do.

Sulin?

No, no, no, no.
ANNIE:
Hey.
Just in time.
Hey, how did you sleep?
Great.
How did you sleep?
(YAWNS) Fine.
Do you want to sit down?
Um... no, no, urn... because I read that it's better for digestion if you stand.
I never heard that.
Um, okay, I'm gonna do the dishes.
No, no, I'll do it, Mom.
Leave it, Mom, I'll do the dishes today.
Excuse me, what?
You have to go to work.
The bridge is down, there's traffic.
- You're gonna be late.
- The bridge?
Yeah, you've gotta go, you're gonna be late.
- ANNIE:
I need my...
- JACK:
Here's the bag, keys, phone...
Hey, I'm going to see aunt Sophie tomorrow.
Do you want to come with?
Uh, no, I've got a lot of stuff to do, like homework.
- Okay.
- Yeah, okay, bye.
(SIGHS)
- Okay, you gotta come inside!
- (EXHALES SHARPLY)
Hey!
I'm not joking!
- (GRUNTS) - (DOORBELL RINGING)
- Okay, just stay here.
Don't move!
- (CONTINUES RINGING)
What up, man?
(GRUNTS)
So how'd you like my octopus, bro?
Mm, lame.
Damn, it's a prototype, yo.
Just gimme some time, I'll be killin' it.
- Eight arms and stuff.
- SULIN:
Hello?
- Hello.
- Whoa.
You gonna intro me, bro?
Uh.
This is Hector.
- Octoman, yo.
- Octoman.
This is...
Her Highness.
Really?
That's her name?
Yeah, that's it.
Well, pound it out, Your Highness. (LAUGHS)
- No!
- (GRUNTS)
- (GROANS)
- Oh, dude, I'm so sorry.
- (GROANS)
- Are you okay?
Yeah, it's cool, man.
- I got seven more, you know.
- (GRUNTS)
So what's the story here?
JACK:
It's complicated, and I don't really want to talk about it right now.
You know what I mean?
Dude, the girl is... whoa!
You gonna hook up?
- (GRUNTS)
- Not if you keep asking stupid questions like that.
- You tell me all about it, though, right?
- Every last detail.
Right, catch you two lovebirds later.
- You can't do that!
- He want to hit me.
No, he went to fistbump you.
It's a greeting, like a handshake.
Didn't you hear Warrior Zhao?
Never touch a princess.
You can get your head chopped off.
That's the rule.
Okay, maybe where you come from, that's the rule.
But here?
Here the rules are different.
When you go back to your world, you can chop off as many heads as you want, I promise.
But here, my world, my rules.
- Okay?
- Okay.
No!
- (SIGHS)
- What are you doing?
Observing your world, so I can learn the rules better.
No, no, no, no, you have to go back inside.
How am I going to learn the rules of your world if I don't see it?
Well, you can't go out dressed like that.
- Why not?
- Because...
Because people will stare and wonder what the heck's going on.
If I was dressed differently could I stand here?
Yes!
Then call the tailor and have him make me new clothes.
Uh, we don't get our clothes from a tailor.
Then take me where you do.
(SAMSAYA'S "STEREOTYPE" PLAYING)
These are men's.
- Hey, hey, hey.
- (CLATTERS)
- Are you okay?
- What's that?
That's ice cream.
It's food.
What does it taste like?
Well, first it's cold, then it's sweet.
Mm.
I want one.
Okay, well, what flavor do you want?
They have chocolate, vanilla, strawberry, cherry, mint chip...
Mm, I want all of them.
All of them?
Okay.

Okay.

- Hey, hey, hey.
Here's your ice cream.
We gotta go.
- That was fun!
- Yeah.
It was.
I like the mall, Jack.
Thank you for bringing me here.
You're welcome.
What did he mean, I'm "the shit?"
Uh, well, when you really like something,
- that's what you say.
- Mm.
(DOOR OPENS)
Hi, Mom.
Uh, hello.
I had ice cream.
- Yeah, I can see that.
- JACK:
Um...
Do you wanna...
Mom, I forgot to tell you.
Um...
The other day in school they asked someone to volunteer to take an exchange student.
And Sulin showed up today.
Uh, you fresh off the boat, huh?
No boat.
I came by box.
- What?
- Uh, she meant plane.
Plane, because box and plane are the same in her language.
- What's the plane?
- (CHUCKLES AWKWARDLY)
- She does this all the time.
- I thought she just got here?
- She did.
- But you just said all the time.
I did.
Um...
I meant that in the time that she's been here.
Are you okay with this?
- Yeah, I mean...
- Uh, no, no, no, no.
Sulin, it is so nice to meet you.
Um, I'm Jack's Mom.
I'm Annie.
Um, I'm so... hungry.
Um, sure, we have salad, and fresh corn and... hamburgers.
Sulin, do you like hamburgers?
I like snails.
Like Jack made me last night.
Last night?
In the Chinese grammar, they get their past and future tenses
- mixed up a lot.
- ANNIE:
Mm.
Um...
You know you're acting very weird.
Why don't you put the burgers on?
Sulin and I will go make up the couch in the guest room for her.
Okay, I'm gonna be gone tomorrow but maybe when I get back, we can, um... get to know each other a little better.
Maybe we can go to the mall.
It's the shit!
(LAUGHS)
- Who told you that?
- Jack.
Okay, this is where you're gonna be sleeping.
(HECTOR OVER COMPUTER) She said that?

I was expecting more.
Okay.
Well, how about this for more?
When I saw she was taken by those...
whatever the hell those were,
I jumped right in after her, man, okay?
How much more can you want?
And by the way, we came the same way, seconds apart.
- She should be here.
- She's not.
- Where is she then?
- I don't know.
How can you not know?
I was right behind her.
I was busy.
Well, maybe she came in and ran out.

Just go back to where I came.
It's not going to happen.
So I'm stuck here?
There's no other way out?
I didn't say that.
I'm not in charge of transportation.

Hello.
What is your name, young man?
Jack.
Oh, Jack.
Welcome, Jack!
Is something wrong?
No, it's just you look a lot like someone I know.
Is he handsome?
Mm?
Mm?
- Yes.
- (CHUCKLES)
Okay, now let's go find the princess.
- JACK:
Can you explain something to me?
- WIZARD:
If I can.
- Well, let's start with the chest.
- The Warrior's Gate.
That's the real name.
- How does it work?
- That's complicated.
Ah, it has to do with time, space, magic and things beyond explaining.
The main thing is that it works.
- Then how do I get back?
- Another chest.
There's another chest?
- Great, where is it?
- (CHUCKLES) Well, that is complicated.
I have to collect four different woods from four different trees that grow in four different parts of the country.
North... where Zebrawood is found.
South, where the spotted bamboo grows.
East, where the black mahogany lives.
And west, where the rarest tree in all the land is found.
That's the only way to build a new box.
But first, let's find the princess.
- You know where she is?
- Oh, another complicated question.
How about an easy one, huh?
- Zhao.
Tell me about Zhao.
- That's easy.
(BABY CRYING)
Warrior Zhao was one of the seven companions raised from birth by the sacred monks for one thing and one thing only:
To protect the Emperor.
The monks trained the seven companions day and night, year in and year out, until they were the most invincible force.
(GRUNTS)
It was their sole purpose in life to protect the Emperor while he brought peace to the land.
There was not a man alive who could defeat them... except one.
Arun The Cruel, King of Barbarians.
As fate would have it,
Zhao was on a mission and late for dinner.
The food had been poisoned.
Fearing the worst, he rushed to protect the Emperor.
But he arrived too late.
(WOMAN SOBBING)
And then, chaos descended from the North.
And the peace the Emperor had worked so hard to build began to fall apart.
With no leader, the army was lost, the people were lost.
Zhao fought relentlessly, but as great a warrior as he was, he needed the help of the greatest warrior that could be found.
And so, by using the Seeing Stone,
- I found you.
- Yes!
And he passed through the Warrior's Gate to get help protecting the greatest treasure we possess.
- Sulin.
- Sulin.
The only one who can rally the people to defeat the Barbarians and save our kingdom.
But I'm not going to be able to help him.
- He thinks I'm worthless.
- Oh, yes, he might, but I don't.
- Based on what?
- You are here.
You didn't have to be.
You could have stayed home.
That says something about who you are.
(LAUGHS SARCASTICALLY) That I'm crazy.
Hmm.
And now if you will excuse me, I have a lot of wood to collect.
See you, bye-bye-
ZHAO:
Come on, let's go!
You know the old saying about blaming the bearer of bad news?
Yes, Your Highness.
- Do you believe it's true?
- I hope not, Your Highness.
Good news. (EXHALES)
I'm getting married!
Bad news.
Warrior Zhao is on his way.
- Kill him.
- (YELLS)
(GRUNTS)
Brutus!
Not him!
Kill Zhao!
Oops.
- JACK:
So I assume you have a plan.
- ZHAO:
I do.
Save the princess.
Prevent her marriage.
Wait, she's getting married?
Forced to.
Unless we stop it.
Uh, who's the groom?
Arun The Cruel.
(SCOFFS) That's his name?
His full name is Arun The Cruel, The Horrible,
The Terrible, The Miserable, but we keep it short.
If the marriage takes place, when she becomes Empress, he becomes Emperor.
And once he's Emperor, he will kill her, and the whole country is doomed.
- Are you finished with dinner?
- I guess.
Now we sleep.
Hey, I know we're roughing it, but do we have any blankets and pillows?
Blankets, no.
Pillow...
Yes.
(SIGHS)
(GRUNTS)
ZHAO:
Good night.
Okay, say we rescue the princess.
Does she have anyone else in mind to marry'?
Not yet.
Any idea what kind of husband she's looking for?
Cause in the little time that we spent together, you know, I...
I felt that we had something, you know?
A connection.
'Cause we like the same clothes, we like the same music.
- You don't... you don't think that...
- No, I don't think, Jack Bronson.
She's looking for someone good, someone brave, a hero.
Yeah.
TREASURER:
Seized in the raid of the capital of Ching Hai province.
1,600 bricks of silver.
1,800 bricks of gold.
Six chests of diamonds and 26 slaves.
- Only 26 slaves?
- Yes, I know.
We're under-performing in that department.
Who's in charge of slaves?
My cousin.
Get rid of him.
(GRUNTS)
Brutus!
I meant the cousin, not him!
Oops...
Let's take a moment here, big fella.
Now, I know you want to please me.
But, next time, before you kill someone, should we have a signal, maybe?
Like something like that?
Like a signal?
Like that, a signal like that.
- Like that?
- Kill him.
- Yes.
Yes.
- Yes.
That signal.
That's the signal.
BARBARIAN:
Your Highness!
(SULIN YELLING)
Finally, my beautiful bride has arrived.
Hello, my love!
How are you?
- Tired from your long trip?
- (GRUNTING)
In need of a hot bath?
A home-cooked meal maybe?
Soon, my love.
Soon.
- (GRUNTING)
- You and me.
- (CHUCKLING) - (MUFFLED YELLING)
You and me.
(YELLING INDISTINCTLY)
Call the tailor for a fitting.
What are you doing?
It's gonna rain.
Mm.
JACK:
There's no clouds.
Not all rain comes from clouds.
Oh.
My God!
Ah!
Oh, my God, it's raining!
The hell is going on?
(GRUNTS)
- He wants me dead.
- So they know we're here?
They know we're somewhere around here, so they just keep shooting arrows everywhere and hope to get lucky.
We call it the morning shower.
Why didn't you wake me up?
I could have been dead.
If I wanted you dead, I'd do it myself.
You have to learn to listen.
- JACK:
What does it say?
- ZHAO: "Do not enter".
What's in there?
The Unknown Lands.
(SIGHS) And what's in the Unknown Lands?
Unknown things.
Okay, wait, but...
You are dropping me off at the Wizard's, right?
- Wrong.
- Okay, look.
I really think it's about time we thought about getting me home.
So do I. Here.
- What's this?
- A map.
It'll take you to the Wizard.
I can't...
I can't read this!
I just want to go home and you're not helping.
I gave you a map.
Okay, so basically it's "get lost, Jack," huh?
"I brought you here against your will.
I kidnapped you!
And now that you are not the person I thought you were, it's 'Adios, amigo, you are not my problem."'
Wrong on number one.
I did not kidnap you.
No one made you jump into that chest.
Right on number two.
You are not my problem.
My problem is to get through the Unknown Lands.
Get past Arun's army, past his personal guard, past the tower guards, find the Princess, get past the tower reinforcements, past the personal guard reinforcements,
- kill Arun...
- Hello.
And then bring the Princess back, so she can be made Empress, and save the country.
That is my problem.
(EXCLAIMS)
(GRUNTS)
(BOTH GRUNT)
So you're saying I don't have a choice.
You do have a choice.
You can save yourself, or you can save her.
I can't save a princess!
You're the Black Knight!
- Oh, yeah, I almost forgot.
- BARBARIAN:
Sire!
Sire!
Sire!
Good news!
Don't be nervous.
It's been my lucky day so far.
I have a good feeling about this one.
I'm glad, Sire.
I'm sure it's good news.
Bad news.
"There is no sign of the Warrior Zhao."
Sire, Sire... (PANTING)
Brutus... (WHIMPERING)
The signal.
Remember the signal?
- The signal?
- Kill him!
(YELLING)
You know, I was thinking.
This Arun dude, maybe if he gets what he wants, he'll change.
You know?
Be like, Arun The Kind?
Do you have people in your world who get what they want by threatening to do bad things?
There's this one kid.
And when you give him what he wants, does he change?
Not really.
"Might" does not make right, Jack.
Right makes right.
If you don't stand up for what is right, then why stand up at all?
That's easy to say.
This kid, he's bigger than me, he's stronger than me.
So what do you do?
I run.
Does that solve your problem?
No.
- JACK:
So You got a girl?
- ZHAO:
No.
- Because?
- Because I have my job.
What, your job doesn't leave time for a personal life?
My job is my life.
That doesn't sound like much fun.
Fun?
Yeah, you know?
Doing things that make you feel good.
- I feel good doing my job.

You gotta loosen up, dude.

Mm-mm.
Just stay still, or I'll poke your eye out.
There you go.
- Magic!

Hmm.

We don't...
we don't have all night.
You do now.
Perhaps if we moved the pot...
Hey, hey, hey!
Respect your elders, boy!
No disrespect, but we have a very important mission and we have to get through.
Well, your very important mission will have to wait!

You want to see me happy, huh?
Just tell me what I need to do, and it will be done.

Invisible women, powder that freezes people in place, boxes that time-travel, and none of this is weird to you, is it?
It's not weird.
It's just magic.
We don't have magic.
Then how do you explain what cannot be explained?
We have science.
Science explains everything.
Does science explain a rainbow or a snowflake?
- Yes.
- But does it explain how you feel when you see the rainbow or the snowflake?
- No.
- So you do have magic.
- Feelings aren't magic.
- What are they then?
I don't know, they're feelings.
Okay?
They make you do and say things you normally wouldn't do or say, like, if you met this girl you never knew, and all of a sudden, there's...
You can't think of anything to say, but you can't stop talking.
And your body is, like, hot and cold at the same time, and your heart is beating like you just ran a mile in a minute,
- and it's... it's like...
- Magic?
Yeah, I guess.

Sorry it took so long, I got lost.
Hey, since we seem to be getting in trouble all the time, maybe it could be good if you showed me a few moves.
Just in case.
Martial arts take many years to learn.
No, I'm not asking for the whole menu.
Just a little something.
Martial arts do not work with a little something.
Well, then, a lot of something.
Anything.
Even if I can do one thing to help out the next time we're in a situation.
Just give me something so I have a fighting chance.
Please.
(SIGHS) Come on.
Come on.
Get up.
Stand feet apart.
Uh, this is cool.
Bend your knees.
Sorry.
Okay.
Now imagine there is a big tree in front of you.
You see it?
- Yeah.
- Is it big?
Yeah.
Okay, now... hug it.
Do what?
I mean, hug the tree.
Good.
- That's it?
- That's it.
Well, how long do I have to stay like this?
(SIGHS)
Mm!

You know, if you're not going to teach me, you should just say so.
- I am teaching you.
- Yeah, right.
Thanks.
Thanks a lot.
Hey.
Hey, wait, what are you doing?
Come on.
Now pay attention.
The secret of all martial arts is the circle.
When you move, the circle moves with you.
Here.
Let me show you.
Hit me.
Hit me again.
(EXCLAIMS)

(GRUNTS)
To understand the circle, you must make the circle.
Live the circle, until the circle is you, and you are the circle.
Understand?

The first army, directly for the capital.
The second army, to the ocean.
And the third army?

Why?
It's beautiful.
Yes, it is, but the fortress is over there, and it could take days to walk all the way around the lake.
Well, we could just swim across in no time.
(SIGHS)
No, Jack, it's not possible.
- Why?
Are there man-eating fish in there?
- No.
- Poisonous snakes?
- No.
- Dragons?
- Not this time of year.
So what's in there that's a problem?
I cannot swim.
You're kidding me?

You... you... you, who can kick the butts of the entire NFL at the same time, and you can't swim?
What's wrong with this picture?
- (LAUGHS)
- They never taught... (SIGHS)
- Oh, come on, where are you going?
- There's no time to waste.
- You're gonna walk?
- We don't have a choice.
Okay, you gotta get over this "you don't have a choice" thing, all right?
You do have a choice.
You're strong and you're coordinated.
Maybe we can work something out.
Okay?
I teach you to swim, you teach me more...
- Deal?
- (SIGHS)
Come on.
- Oh!
- You can do it.
You can do it, man, come on.
Trust me.
(SIGHS)

Now, put the shield down...
And hop on!
(GASPS)

There you go.
- JACK:
You're having fun?
- ZHAO:
Yeah.
I bet you didn't get too much of that growing up the way you did.
Fun?
No.
Well, when this is all over, you can make up for that.
Maybe you can come visit me.
I'll show you around, maybe get my Mom to take us to Disneyland or something.
I told you, I can never take off from my job.
Hey, man, look, you really got to get a life.
When you are responsible for a life, you don't have a life.
Okay.
Did you... did you, like, go to school to learn how to say things like that?
Like what?
(SIGHS)
(IMITATES ZHAO) "When you are responsible for a life, you don't have a life."
What's wrong with it?
Nothing's wrong with it, it just... sounds smart.
It does?
Yeah.
It does.
(CHUCKLING)
ZHAO:
So what's in Disneyland?
- JACK:
A lot of princesses.
- Oh!
- A Chinese one too.
- Ooh!
(SOLDIERS YELLING IN MANDARIN)
(ZHAO, WHISPERING) Get down, get down, get down!
- So you do have a plan, right?
- I told you the plan.
- Ah, right.
Get past the army.
- Yes.
- Get past the personal guards.
- Correct.
Get past the tower guards, find the princess,
- get past reinforcements.
- Good.
- Kill Arun.
- Exactly.
Crown Sulin Empress and save the country?
You're learning to listen.
Yeah, the real question is, do you have a plan to execute the plan?
- Hmm?
- (JACK STAMMERS)
(SOLDIERS YELLING IN MANDARIN)
(SOLDIERS HUSH)
- Good morning!
- Mm?
Uh...
JACK:
Great plan.
- Are we in the fortress?
- Yeah.
- Are we past the army?
- Yeah.
Have we passed the personal guards?
Almost.
Well, then I think that the plan is working.
I think the plan to get in is working.
How about a plan to get out?
I'm working on it.
Warrior Zhao,
I'm so honored that you've come all this way to attend my wedding.
I'm not here to attend your wedding.
I'm here to attend your funeral.
(CHUCKLING)
- And you are?
- He's the Black Knight.
(STAMMERING) I'm not the Black Knight, okay?
I'm Jack Bronson.
Jack Bronson...
I've got good news.
And I've got bad news.
The good news is, tomorrow, when my bride and I are married, we will stand, there.
And you two, will stand... there.
Okay.
What's the bad news?
As soon as we take our vows, and our new life begins...
(TRAP DOOR OPENING)
Your life ends.
- He's not bluffing, is he?
- Arun doesn't do bluffs.
Maybe he'll be feeling generous on his wedding day and he'll pardon us.
Arun doesn't do generous.
Okay.
If he doesn't do this and he doesn't do that, is there anything that he does do?
- He murders and pillages.
- So in other words, we're dead.
When one door closes, another one opens.

You're the Black Knight.
You have skills.
Okay.
I don't...
I don't get it.
'Cause one minute you're telling me I'm worthless and after a few lessons, I'm not?
It's not just me who thinks you are not worthless, Jack.
The way the princess looks at you?
She believes in you.

For trying to turn me into a warrior.
You were a warrior from the beginning, Jack, on the inside.
It just had to be brought out.
Yeah, a lot of good it did.
It's not over yet.
What do you mean, it's not over yet?
In a minute, she's gonna be married, and we're gonna be hanged.
Jack, worrying is not gonna change anything.
Just live in the moment.
No offense, but I think we've run out of moments.
Do you, Arun, take Sulin, in sickness and in health,

- I do.
She does.

He said he'd be right back.
It is the rule.
Or what, huh?
I get my head chopped off?
You guys and your rules, man.
It's also against the rules to smile?

Wow.

There's no one here to see.
- Okay.

I wanted to see you before you went back.
Actually, I wish I could go with you, even for one day.
You are the Empress now, you can do whatever you want.
Because I'm the Empress, I can't.
Every minute of every day from now on will be filled with ministers and ambassadors, and papers to sign and decisions to make.
No dancing, no singing.
- No fun.

I would love to go to the mall, to eat ice cream.

I can't.

I can't let him down.

I owe it to him.

You said the park on Magnolia was your spot.
You didn't... you didn't say anything about this.

- Where'd he go?
What's your problem?
Trouble again?
You mean trouble still.
You should use some of those moves from your game, Jack.
Kick some butt.
That's the gaming world, Mr. Chang.
This is the real world.
One's got nothing to do with the other.
- Bravery is bravery.
- Look at me.
Do I even look like I have one ounce of brave in me?
Looking and being are two different things, young Jack.
Not in this case.
Here, it's what you see is what you get.
Well, let's see if I can get some work out of my employee.
Okay.
How are things at home?
Eh, Mom's worried about money.
The real estate market's dead.
She hasn't sold anything in months.
Looks like we're gonna have to move.
I wish I could do something to help her out, invent a cool app or something.
What's all this?
It's a new shipment from my cousin in Beijing.
Help me open it.
Mr. Chang, what's this?
This has been in my family since forever.
You like it?
Yeah.
I do.
The Dancing Princess.
Yeah, looks like she's breaking.
You know, like...
See?
Look.
I don't think so, young Jack.
She lived a long, long time ago.
She saved her country from the Barbarians.
Talk about brave.
She was brave.
This little girl can kick butt, big time.
Where do I put it?
How about your house?
What do you mean?
I mean, a present.
- No, Mr. Chang, I can't.
- Oh, sure you can.
You watch the shop while I go on vacation.
But you're already overpaying me for that.
Bad manners to refuse a gift.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- Hey, so I have an idea.
- Mm.
This house... really kinda too big for the both of us.
I mean, when Dad was here, fine.
But now, you know, maybe we should think about renting a room out, you know, to some kid from the university or something.
What did I do to deserve a kid like you?
Win the lottery?
Good night.
What?
Where is the Black Knight?
I'm the Black Knight!
You lie, you die!
Black Knight!
It's Octoman!
- Hey, wait, wait!
- I challenge you to a duel to the death!
It's a video game!
It's a video game!
Okay?
I just want to show you, man.
I have eight arms now, bro!
Okay, see?
That's the challenger.
And that's me, the Black Knight.
Yeah.
It's me.
Look, when I move... he moves.
Fight!
You are the winner!
Just you wait man, I'm gonna come back with twelve arms.
So you are the Black Knight?
In the game world, I'm the Black Knight.
In this world, I'm Jack Bronson.
Jack Bronson is worthless to me.
Jack Bronson, I need your help.
For what?
I need you to guard the most precious treasure of the empire.
Excuse me?
The Princess and future Empress.
Oh...
Hi.
I'm Jack...
Anyone who touches the princess dies!
That is the rule.
No exceptions?
There is no point of having a rule if you have an exception.
Sometimes it's good to be a little flexible.
If anything happens to her...
I am hallucinating.
This is crazy.
This isn't happening, this isn't happening.
- Where are your weapons?
- My weapons?
Warrior Zhao said you were going to protect me.
To protect me you need to have skills.
And weapons.
Okay, you know, I think Warrior Zhao is a little confused 'cause...
I'm not the Black Knight.
I don't have skills, or weapons.
So Warrior Zhao was right.
You are worthless.
Okay, you know what, can we start over?
I'm Jack.
- What do I call you?
- Your Highness.
I meant your name.

I never heard that.
Um, okay, I'm gonna do the dishes.
No, no, I'll do it, Mom.
Leave it, Mom, I'll do the dishes today.
Excuse me, what?
You have to go to work.

Okay, you gotta come inside!
Hey!
I'm not joking!
Okay, just stay here.
Don't move!
What up, man?
So how'd you like my octopus, bro?
Mm, lame.
Damn, it's a prototype, yo.
Just gimme some time, I'll be killin' it.
- Eight arms and stuff.
- Hello?
- Hello.
- Whoa.
You gonna intro me, bro?
Uh.
This is Hector.
- Octoman, yo.
- Octoman.
This is...
Her Highness.
Really?
That's her name?
Yeah, that's it.
Well, pound it out, Your Highness.
No!
Oh, dude, I'm so sorry.
Are you okay?
Yeah, it's cool, man.
I got seven more, you know.
So what's the story here?
It's complicated, and I don't really want to talk about it right now.
You know what I mean?
Dude, the girl is... whoa!
You gonna hook up?
Not if you keep asking stupid questions like that.
- You tell me all about it, though, right?
- Every last detail.
Right, catch you two lovebirds later.
- You can't do that!
- He want to hit me.
No, he went to fistbump you.
It's a greeting, like a handshake.
Didn't you hear Warrior Zhao?
Never touch a princess.
You can get your head chopped off.
That's the rule.
Okay, maybe where you come from, that's the rule.
But here?
Here the rules are different.
When you go back to your world, you can chop off as many heads as you want, I promise.
But here, my world, my rules.
- Okay?
- Okay.
No!
What are you doing?
Observing your world, so I can learn the rules better.
No, no, no, no, you have to go back inside.
How am I going to learn the rules of your world if I don't see it?
Well, you can't go out dressed like that.
- Why not?
- Because...
Because people will stare and wonder what the heck's going on.
If I was dressed differently could I stand here?
Yes!
Then call the tailor and have him make me new clothes.
Uh, we don't get our clothes from a tailor.
Then take me where you do.
These are men's.
Hey, hey, hey.
- Are you okay?
- What's that?
That's ice cream.
It's food.
What does it taste like?
Well, first it's cold, then it's sweet.
Mm.
I want one.
Okay, well, what flavor do you want?
They have chocolate, vanilla, strawberry, cherry, mint chip...
Mm, I want all of them.
All of them?
Okay.
Okay.
- Girl, you the shit.
- Hey, hey, hey.
Here's your ice cream.
We gotta go.
- That was fun!
- Yeah.
It was.
I like the mall, Jack.
Thank you for bringing me here.
You're welcome.
What did he mean, I'm "the shit?"
Uh, well, when you really like something,
- that's what you say.
- Mm.
Hi, Mom.
Uh, hello.
I had ice cream.
- Yeah, I can see that.
- Um...
Do you wanna...
Mom, I forgot to tell you.
Um...
The other day in school they asked someone to volunteer to take an exchange student.
And Sulin showed up today.
Uh, you fresh off the boat, huh?
No boat.
I came by box.
- What?
- Uh, she meant plane.
Plane, because box and plane are the same in her language.
What's the plane?
- She does this all the time.
- I thought she just got here?
- She did.
- But you just said all the time.
I did.
Um...
I meant that in the time that she's been here.
Are you okay with this?
- Yeah, I mean...
- Uh, no, no, no, no.
Sulin, it is so nice to meet you.
Um, I'm Jack's Mom.
I'm Annie.
Um, I'm so... hungry.
Um, sure, we have salad, and fresh corn and... hamburgers.
Sulin, do you like hamburgers?
I like snails.
Like Jack made me last night.
Last night?
In the Chinese grammar, they get their past and future tenses
- mixed up a lot.
- Mm.
Um...
You know you're acting very weird.
Why don't you put the burgers on?
Sulin and I will go make up the couch in the guest room for her.
Okay, I'm gonna be gone tomorrow but maybe when I get back, we can, um... get to know each other a little better.
Maybe we can go to the mall.
It's the shit!
- Who told you that?
- Jack.
Okay, this is where you're gonna be sleeping.
She said that?
To my Mom.
That is ill, dude.
Hector, gimme a break.
I don't know, man, the girl is hot, yo.
Good night, Hector.
Excuse me...
The bed next door...
it's in the wrong position.
Very bad feng shui.
I can't sleep.
Huh.
Hmm.
This one is good feng shui.
Ooh!
Don't forget to clean the house.
Oh, don't worry.
You won't recognize the place when you get back.
- Yeah?
Sure.
- Say hey to Aunt Sophie.
Where is she?
Who the hell are you?
- Where is the princess?
- Look, man, I don't know, okay?
I'm here.
Whoa!
Stay back!
Oh, no, no, no!
Jack!
Please help me!
Help!
Jack!
Jack!
Jack!
Jack!
Jack!
Jack!
Jack!
Jack!
Jack!
Jack!
Jack!
Jack!
Come on!
Help!
Help!
Jack!
Okay.
I told you not to let her out of your sight!
You are worthless!
I'm not a warrior!
I don't know what you were expecting!
I was expecting more.
Okay.
Well, how about this for more?
When I saw she was taken by those...
whatever the hell those were,
I jumped right in after her, man, okay?
How much more can you want?
And by the way, we came the same way, seconds apart.
- She should be here.
- She's not.
- Where is she then?
- I don't know.
How can you not know?
I was right behind her.
I was busy.
Well, maybe she came in and ran out.
- She's probably right outside.
- Wait, don't!
Oops.
Okay.
Okay.
I don't want you to think I'm ducking out on you, 'cause I'm not, but, you know, I got a lot of homework to do and I should be getting back by now.
Just go back to where I came.
It's not going to happen.
So I'm stuck here?
There's no other way out?
I didn't say that.
I'm not in charge of transportation.
- Well, who is?
- The Wizard is.
And where is the Wizard?
Jack Bronson!
I wouldn't do that.
Wake up!
Stop!
Never wake a sleeping Wizard.
Why?
I'll get my head chopped off?
Yes, how did you know?
Lucky guess.
What is it with you people and chopping off heads?
I mean, really.
It's effective.
Close the door!
Cut the rope!
Hmm.
Mm.
Hmm.
Get behind me!
Open the door!
There's like thousands of...
Just open it.
Okay...
Oh, sorry.
Hello.
What is your name, young man?
Jack.
Oh, Jack.
Welcome, Jack!
Is something wrong?
No, it's just you look a lot like someone I know.
Is he handsome?
Mm?
Mm?
Yes.
Okay, now let's go find the princess.
- Can you explain something to me?
- If I can.
- Well, let's start with the chest.
- The Warrior's Gate.
That's the real name.
- How does it work?
- That's complicated.
Ah, it has to do with time, space, magic and things beyond explaining.
The main thing is that it works.
- Then how do I get back?
- Another chest.
There's another chest?
- Great, where is it?
- Well, that is complicated.
I have to collect four different woods from four different trees that grow in four different parts of the country.
North... where Zebrawood is found.
South, where the spotted bamboo grows.
East, where the black mahogany lives.
And west, where the rarest tree in all the land is found.
That's the only way to build a new box.
But first, let's find the princess.
- You know where she is?
- Oh, another complicated question.
How about an easy one, huh?
- Zhao.
Tell me about Zhao.
- That's easy.
Warrior Zhao was one of the seven companions raised from birth by the sacred monks for one thing and one thing only:
To protect the Emperor.
The monks trained the seven companions day and night, year in and year out, until they were the most invincible force.
It was their sole purpose in life to protect the Emperor while he brought peace to the land.
There was not a man alive who could defeat them... except one.
Arun The Cruel, King of Barbarians.
As fate would have it,
Zhao was on a mission and late for dinner.
The food had been poisoned.
Fearing the worst, he rushed to protect the Emperor.
But he arrived too late.
And then, chaos descended from the North.
And the peace the Emperor had worked so hard to build began to fall apart.
With no leader, the army was lost, the people were lost.
Zhao fought relentlessly, but as great a warrior as he was, he needed the help of the greatest warrior that could be found.
And so, by using the Seeing Stone,
- I found you.
- Yes!
And he passed through the Warrior's Gate to get help protecting the greatest treasure we possess.
- Sulin.
- Sulin.
The only one who can rally the people to defeat the Barbarians and save our kingdom.
But I'm not going to be able to help him.
- He thinks I'm worthless.
- Oh, yes, he might, but I don't.
- Based on what?
- You are here.
You didn't have to be.
You could have stayed home.
That says something about who you are.
That I'm crazy.
Hmm.
And now if you will excuse me, I have a lot of wood to collect.
See you, bye-bye-
Come on, let's go!
You know the old saying about blaming the bearer of bad news?
Yes, Your Highness.
- Do you believe it's true?
- I hope not, Your Highness.
Good news.
I'm getting married!
Bad news.
Warrior Zhao is on his way.
Kill him.
Brutus!
Not him!
Kill Zhao!
Oops.
- So I assume you have a plan.
- I do.
Save the princess.
Prevent her marriage.
Wait, she's getting married?
Forced to.
Unless we stop it.
Uh, who's the groom?
Arun The Cruel.
That's his name?
His full name is Arun The Cruel, The Horrible,
The Terrible, The Miserable, but we keep it short.
If the marriage takes place, when she becomes Empress, he becomes Emperor.
And once he's Emperor, he will kill her, and the whole country is doomed.
- Are you finished with dinner?
- I guess.
Now we sleep.
Hey, I know we're roughing it, but do we have any blankets and pillows?
Blankets, no.
Pillow...
Yes.
Good night.
Okay, say we rescue the princess.
Does she have anyone else in mind to marry'?
Not yet.
Any idea what kind of husband she's looking for?
Cause in the little time that we spent together, you know, I...
I felt that we had something, you know?
A connection.
'Cause we like the same clothes, we like the same music.
- You don't... you don't think that...
- No, I don't think, Jack Bronson.
She's looking for someone good, someone brave, a hero.
Yeah.
Seized in the raid of the capital of Ching Hai province.
1,600 bricks of silver.
1,800 bricks of gold.
Six chests of diamonds and 26 slaves.
- Only 26 slaves?
- Yes, I know.
We're under-performing in that department.
Who's in charge of slaves?
My cousin.
Get rid of him.
Brutus!
I meant the cousin, not him!
Oops...
Let's take a moment here, big fella.
Now, I know you want to please me.
But, next time, before you kill someone, should we have a signal, maybe?
Like something like that?
Like a signal?
Like that, a signal like that.
- Like that?
- Kill him.
- Yes.
Yes.
- Yes.
That signal.
That's the signal.
Your Highness!
Finally, my beautiful bride has arrived.
Hello, my love!
How are you?
Tired from your long trip?
In need of a hot bath?
A home-cooked meal maybe?
Soon, my love.
Soon.
You and me.
You and me.
Call the tailor for a fitting.
What are you doing?
It's gonna rain.
Mm.
There's no clouds.
Not all rain comes from clouds.
Oh.
My God!
Ah!
Oh, my God, it's raining!
The hell is going on?
- He wants me dead.
- So they know we're here?
They know we're somewhere around here, so they just keep shooting arrows everywhere and hope to get lucky.
We call it the morning shower.
Why didn't you wake me up?
I could have been dead.
If I wanted you dead, I'd do it myself.
You have to learn to listen.
- What does it say?
- "Do not enter".
What's in there?
The Unknown Lands.
And what's in the Unknown Lands?
Unknown things.
Okay, wait, but...
You are dropping me off at the Wizard's, right?
- Wrong.
- Okay, look.
I really think it's about time we thought about getting me home.
So do I. Here.
- What's this?
- A map.
It'll take you to the Wizard.
I can't...
I can't read this!
I just want to go home and you're not helping.
I gave you a map.
Okay, so basically it's "get lost, Jack," huh?
"I brought you here against your will.
I kidnapped you!
And now that you are not the person I thought you were, it's 'Adios, amigo, you are not my problem."'
Wrong on number one.
I did not kidnap you.
No one made you jump into that chest.
Right on number two.
You are not my problem.
My problem is to get through the Unknown Lands.
Get past Arun's army, past his personal guard, past the tower guards, find the Princess, get past the tower reinforcements, past the personal guard reinforcements,
- kill Arun...
- Hello.
And then bring the Princess back, so she can be made Empress, and save the country.
That is my problem.
So you're saying I don't have a choice.
You do have a choice.
You can save yourself, or you can save her.
I can't save a princess!
You're the Black Knight!
- Oh, yeah, I almost forgot.
- Sire!
Sire!
Sire!
Good news!
Don't be nervous.
It's been my lucky day so far.
I have a good feeling about this one.
I'm glad, Sire.
I'm sure it's good news.
Bad news.
"There is no sign of the Warrior Zhao."
Sire, Sire...
Brutus...
The signal.
Remember the signal?
- The signal?
- Kill him!
You know, I was thinking.
This Arun dude, maybe if he gets what he wants, he'll change.
You know?
Be like, Arun The Kind?
Do you have people in your world who get what they want by threatening to do bad things?
There's this one kid.
And when you give him what he wants, does he change?
Not really.
"Might" does not make right, Jack.
Right makes right.
If you don't stand up for what is right, then why stand up at all?
That's easy to say.
This kid, he's bigger than me, he's stronger than me.
So what do you do?
I run.
Does that solve your problem?
No.
- So You got a girl?
- No.
- Because?
- Because I have my job.
What, your job doesn't leave time for a personal life?
My job is my life.
That doesn't sound like much fun.
Fun?
Yeah, you know?
Doing things that make you feel good.
I feel good doing my job.
You gotta loosen up, dude.
Come on.
Ever seen this before?
No?
Okay, look.
It's called dancing, okay?
It's like, uh...
No?
Okay, try these on.
Mm-mm.
Just stay still, or I'll poke your eye out.
There you go.
- Magic!
- It's cool.
Okay, I'm gonna lay down a beat and you just move your hips, okay?
I don't have time for fun.
Man, come on.
Come on, we don't have all day.
Ooh.
Wow.
Excuse me, but we have to get through.
And I need to finish cooking my soup.
How long is that going to take?
Hmm.
All night.
We don't...
we don't have all night.
You do now.
Perhaps if we moved the pot...
Hey, hey, hey!
Respect your elders, boy!
No disrespect, but we have a very important mission and we have to get through.
Well, your very important mission will have to wait!
To wait... to wait... to wait...
For my potatoes to soften.
I'm sorry.
- It can't.
- No!
Over here!
Here!
Whoa!
Help me up!
Now!
Come on, Jack.
Come on.
I did not sign up for this!
Not fire!
I hate fire!
Maybe not so worthless after all.
You're welcome.
My bride.
I hope you like your new palace.
And in two days' time, you will take your place next to me.
Of course, your throne will be...
- much lower.
- I would rather die.
Whatever makes you happy, my dear.
You want to see me happy, huh?
Just tell me what I need to do, and it will be done.
Well...
Come close.
And I will whisper it in your ear.
Tell me, my love, my sweet songbird, what do I need to do to make you happy?
Die.
As much as I'd like to make you happy, me dying is not on the agenda.
However, if you insist on someone dying, it can be arranged.
Take her away!
Your dinner.
Get out!
Invisible women, powder that freezes people in place, boxes that time-travel, and none of this is weird to you, is it?
It's not weird.
It's just magic.
We don't have magic.
Then how do you explain what cannot be explained?
We have science.
Science explains everything.
Does science explain a rainbow or a snowflake?
- Yes.
- But does it explain how you feel when you see the rainbow or the snowflake?
- No.
- So you do have magic.
- Feelings aren't magic.
- What are they then?
I don't know, they're feelings.
Okay?
They make you do and say things you normally wouldn't do or say, like, if you met this girl you never knew, and all of a sudden, there's...
You can't think of anything to say, but you can't stop talking.
And your body is, like, hot and cold at the same time, and your heart is beating like you just ran a mile in a minute,
- and it's... it's like...
- Magic?
Yeah, I guess.
Zhao, I've got the wood!
Sorry it took so long, I got lost.
Hey, since we seem to be getting in trouble all the time, maybe it could be good if you showed me a few moves.
Just in case.
Martial arts take many years to learn.
No, I'm not asking for the whole menu.
Just a little something.
Martial arts do not work with a little something.
Well, then, a lot of something.
Anything.
Even if I can do one thing to help out the next time we're in a situation.
Just give me something so I have a fighting chance.
Please.
Come on.
Come on.
Get up.
Stand feet apart.
Uh, this is cool.
Bend your knees.
Sorry.
Okay.
Now imagine there is a big tree in front of you.
You see it?
- Yeah.
- Is it big?
Yeah.
Okay, now... hug it.
Do what?
I mean, hug the tree.
Good.
- That's it?
- That's it.
Well, how long do I have to stay like this?
Mm!
You know, if you're not going to teach me, you should just say so.
- I am teaching you.
- Yeah, right.
Thanks.
Thanks a lot.
Hey.
Hey, wait, what are you doing?
Come on.
Now pay attention.
The secret of all martial arts is the circle.
When you move, the circle moves with you.
Here.
Let me show you.
Hit me.
Hit me again.
Again.
To understand the circle, you must make the circle.
Live the circle, until the circle is you, and you are the circle.
Understand?
We move the moment she says "I do."
The first army, directly for the capital.
The second army, to the ocean.
And the third army?
- We have a third army?
- Yes.
Just let them rob and pillage.
Excuse me, Sire.
For the wedding canopy, red or blue?
Red or blue, my love?
Oops.
And this is called not good.
Why?
It's beautiful.
Yes, it is, but the fortress is over there, and it could take days to walk all the way around the lake.
Well, we could just swim across in no time.
No, Jack, it's not possible.
- Why?
Are there man-eating fish in there?
- No.
- Poisonous snakes?
- No.
- Dragons?
- Not this time of year.
So what's in there that's a problem?
I cannot swim.
You're kidding me?
You... you... you, who can kick the butts of the entire NFL at the same time, and you can't swim?
What's wrong with this picture?
They never taught...
- Oh, come on, where are you going?
- There's no time to waste.
- You're gonna walk?
- We don't have a choice.
Okay, you gotta get over this "you don't have a choice" thing, all right?
You do have a choice.
You're strong and you're coordinated.
Maybe we can work something out.
Okay?
I teach you to swim, you teach me more...
Deal?
Come on.
- Oh!
- You can do it.
You can do it, man, come on.
Trust me.
Hey, that's it.
There you go.
Now, put the shield down...
And hop on!
Hey!
There you go.
- You're having fun?
- Yeah.
I bet you didn't get too much of that growing up the way you did.
Fun?
No.
Well, when this is all over, you can make up for that.
Maybe you can come visit me.
I'll show you around, maybe get my Mom to take us to Disneyland or something.
I told you, I can never take off from my job.
Hey, man, look, you really got to get a life.
When you are responsible for a life, you don't have a life.
Okay.
Did you... did you, like, go to school to learn how to say things like that?
Like what?
"When you are responsible for a life, you don't have a life."
What's wrong with it?
Nothing's wrong with it, it just... sounds smart.
It does?
Yeah.
It does.
So what's in Disneyland?
- A lot of princesses.
- Oh!
- A Chinese one too.
- Ooh!
Get down, get down, get down!
- So you do have a plan, right?
- I told you the plan.
- Ah, right.
Get past the army.
- Yes.
- Get past the personal guards.
- Correct.
Get past the tower guards, find the princess,
- get past reinforcements.
- Good.
- Kill Arun.
- Exactly.
Crown Sulin Empress and save the country?
You're learning to listen.
Yeah, the real question is, do you have a plan to execute the plan?
Hmm?
- Good morning!
- Mm?
Uh...
Great plan.
- Are we in the fortress?
- Yeah.
- Are we past the army?
- Yeah.
Have we passed the personal guards?
Almost.
Well, then I think that the plan is working.
I think the plan to get in is working.
How about a plan to get out?
I'm working on it.
Warrior Zhao,
I'm so honored that you've come all this way to attend my wedding.
I'm not here to attend your wedding.
I'm here to attend your funeral.
- And you are?
- He's the Black Knight.
I'm not the Black Knight, okay?
I'm Jack Bronson.
Jack Bronson...
I've got good news.
And I've got bad news.
The good news is, tomorrow, when my bride and I are married, we will stand, there.
And you two, will stand... there.
Okay.
What's the bad news?
As soon as we take our vows, and our new life begins...
Your life ends.
- He's not bluffing, is he?
- Arun doesn't do bluffs.
Maybe he'll be feeling generous on his wedding day and he'll pardon us.
Arun doesn't do generous.
Okay.
If he doesn't do this and he doesn't do that, is there anything that he does do?
- He murders and pillages.
- So in other words, we're dead.
When one door closes, another one opens.
See?
Dinner is served.
It's time to eat.
Uh... excuse me.
Uh, would you mind... you know, so we can...
Thank you.
Here.
Dudes, I'm looking for the princess.
Know where she is?
What now?
Now's the time to use what I've taught you.
- I'm not ready.
- Of course you are.
You're the Black Knight.
You have skills.
Okay.
I don't...
I don't get it.
'Cause one minute you're telling me I'm worthless and after a few lessons, I'm not?
It's not just me who thinks you are not worthless, Jack.
The way the princess looks at you?
She believes in you.
- She does?
- Now go rescue her.
Go!
- What's up?
- Huh?
Jack.
Jack.
Are you okay?
I'm sorry.
You came to save me!
I guess.
I knew you would.
You did?
From the very first.
Great plan, we did it.
Um... how do we get out of here?
I'm working on it.
You better work fast.
They're coming.
How many?
I don't know. 25?
I need to know exactly how many.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten... 13,14,15... 27, 28, 29, 30!
Thirty?
Thirty!
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.
- Thirty-one!
- 31!
31!
26, 27, 28, 29, 30...
That worked.
Why do you still have this on?
I like it.
Come on, get on.
Go!
Are you on?
- Are you on?
Get on, then!
- No, I'm not.
- Let's go!
- Come on!
Almost there!
Hyah!
Come on.
Amazing animals.
Raised each and every one of them from birth.
Fed by my hand only.
Nursed them when they were sick.
They are more loyal than all my men.
They would die for me.
As will the two of you.
And you, my dear, by this time tomorrow, you and I will be husband and wife.
Emperor, and Empress.
Allow me, my love.
Take them away.
- What are they doing?
- Ancient custom.
Last look.
Last meal.
So you know what you're missing.
Okay.
- How can you eat?
- I'm hungry.
They're gonna kill us!
You should try it, it's actually pretty good.
I don't care if it's the best food in the world, man!
I'm Still a kid!
I got my whole life ahead of me.
Now there's a million things that I'm never gonna be able to do!
Like what?
Dude, I've never even kissed a girl!
Me neither.
You know, I was that close before you came in the room.
Yeah... but that's not the point.
- With the princess?
How close?
- That's not the point.
- What was that?
- A butterfly.
- You spoke to a butterfly?
- Apparently.
And it understood you?
Hopefully.
We are gathered here today to witness the marriage of Arun The Cruel,
The Mean, The Horrible,
The Terrible...
The Strong!
Can we move it along?
Uh...
Hey.
I, uh...
I wanted to say thank you.
For what?
For trying to turn me into a warrior.
You were a warrior from the beginning, Jack, on the inside.
It just had to be brought out.
Yeah, a lot of good it did.
It's not over yet.
What do you mean, it's not over yet?
In a minute, she's gonna be married, and we're gonna be hanged.
Jack, worrying is not gonna change anything.
Just live in the moment.
No offense, but I think we've run out of moments.
Do you, Arun, take Sulin, in sickness and in health,
- for better and worse...
- I do.
She does.
"I now pronounce you man and wife."
Uh... uh...
To make it official, you must now kiss the bride.
Hello!
Wizard!
Wait, how did you get here?
Shh!
See?
It's simple!
Now just go save her!
Great, urn, how?
Jump!
Jump?
Come on, man.
- Jack!
Jack!
- Use a little jump powder.
Come on.
Here you go.
- Now jump!
- Jump how?
- Now!
- What do you mean, now?
These powders are Wizard-specific!
You can do it, Jack!
- Jump!
- Okay!
Come on!
That way!
Sulin!
Whoa!
Would you stop that, please?
It's a total buzzkill!
Okay, come on!
Let's go!
Now!
Get back!
Get back!
Jack, here.
Hey, wait, wait, wait,
- I don't know how to read these.
- Just throw!
Oh.
Nice.
Huh?
Huh?
Go save the princess!
Come on, let's go!
Come on!
Oh, Jack!
Zhao!
Huh?
It's time to go.
Sulin?
Sulin!
Sulin!
Sulin!
Jack.
- Jack...
- Are you okay?
Hold on.
Hold on.
Almost there.
But not quite.
Why are you doing this?
You're not a warrior.
Not even a grown man.
Run along.
And I'll let you live.
You run along and I'll let you live.
Let me think about it.
No.
I think I'll stay, I think I'll take one leg.
Take your other leg.
Then I'll take your arms.
No.
I'll just kill you.
Jack!
Jack!
You're the shit.
Thanks.
Hey, Zhao!
The Empress requests your presence.
Okay, I'm just waiting on the Wizard.
Jack, if the Empress summons you, you must come at once.
He said he'd be right back.
It is the rule.
Or what, huh?
I get my head chopped off?
You guys and your rules, man.
It's also against the rules to smile?
- Hi.
- Hey.
Wow.
What, sure I'm not gonna get my head chopped off?
There's no one here to see.
Okay.
I wanted to see you before you went back.
Actually, I wish I could go with you, even for one day.
You are the Empress now, you can do whatever you want.
Because I'm the Empress, I can't.
Every minute of every day from now on will be filled with ministers and ambassadors, and papers to sign and decisions to make.
No dancing, no singing.
No fun.
I would love to go to the mall, to eat ice cream.
But I...
I can't.
My father worked so hard to bring peace to the whole country.
I can't let him down.
He gave his life for our people.
I owe it to him.
I understand.
But I did want to thank you for giving me memories that I will always treasure.
I want to give you one I hope you will too.
I don't think you're worthless.
I never did.
Goodbye, Jack.
He touched the Empress!
He must die!
Wizard?
Wizard!
I'm here!
- I gotta go!
- Got it!
No, I gotta go now!
I gotta go!
I know.
I put it somewhere.
- I gotta go!
- ' Yes!
You see?
Okay!
It's not ready, man?
Come on!
Hurry!
- Relax.
- Jack!
So, after all we've been through, you're gonna kill me?
Really?
Rules are rules.
If we did not live by them, we'd be nothing more than barbarians.
Unless we can make an exception.
Sometimes it's good to be a little flexible, right?
I hate you.
Here.
Thank you.
Goodbye, Jack Bronson.
I will never forget you and the lesson you taught me.
It's done.
The last missing piece of wood.
I might have learned to be flexible, but they haven't.
- Hurry up, let's go.
- Yes!
- Come on, man.
Get it in!
- Let's go!
Hurry up!
Come on!
Jack!
Hi, Mom.
What... what happened here?
It's complicated.
Mm.
I'm sure it is.
Hello, Dickweed.
Come on, Travis, I'm gonna be late for class.
You're gonna be late... permanently.
It doesn't have to be this way.
You're right.
It doesn't.
You could... run.
Yeah, nice.
You tell him, man.
Coward.
Okay.
I gave you the option.
You gave me the option?
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
You wanna dance?
Let's get this over with.
- Oh, man.

A-hole!
You all right, man?

Don't touch me!
You had enough?

- You all right, man?
Hey, come on, man.
Come on.
- Come on, get up!
Get up!
- Don't touch me!
What you doin'?
Sweetie, we have to move.
I couldn't make the payment.
We're losing the house.
No, we're not.
- Um, it's a check!
- Yeah.
- For $25,000.
- Yeah.
- It's made out to you?
- Yeah.
I don't understand.
Well, I, um...
I came up with the idea for a game.
And I sold it.
- Wait, you're kidding.
- No.
Ah, I'm sorry, I have to sit down.
A video game?
What's it called?
Uh, The Warrior's Gate.
- The Wa...
- Oh, come on!
- I'll have a chocolate cone, please.
- Uh, I'll have chocolate too.
And vanilla, and cherry, and strawberry.
Hi.
- What are you...
- Doing here?
- Uh...
- I've made a new rule.
Everyone takes vacation.
Even the Empress.
Very modern, huh?
Wait, how did you...
- Get here?
- Yeah.
I had the Wizard make another box.
Oh!
This is... this is so awesome!
[Warrior's gate]
My hero...
You are the winner.
Oh he shots, he scores.
Come on black knights strikes again.
Jack!
When are you just gonna clean up?
You know people are coming to see the house.
- Yeah I'm doing homework.
- Homework?
- Yeah homework.
- You think I'm fools?
- No, I'm working on that.
- Homework.
- I've never seen that before.
- Want me upgrade the computer?
Hey I don't mean to put pressure on you sweetie, but you really got to grade at school.
As good as point a.
I just..
I can't afford college.
You gotta got a scholarship.
Is nothing selling?
6 months, not a house..
Not an apartment.
Hey Mr. Chang says everything happens for a reason..
Yeah, you know what?
Well Mr. Chang is not getting his home foreclosed down in 90 days.
I'm sorry.
I know hes your friend and..
It's really sweet of him to give you a job and everything, but..
We don't need philosophy.
We need a break.
Hey..
- How's it going with Travis and them?
- Oh it's fine.
- No more bully.
- I just told you.
Okay.
- I love you.
- Love you too.
No more gaming, until you finish your homework.
- Is that a threat?
- Yup.
I'm the octo man!
[Accept challenge]
- Hector you dork, an octopus has 8 arms.
- Whatever.
Look who's here?
- Watch this dork!
- Oh no Travis.

Get away.
- Hey Travis you all right there?
- Oh Travis I'm really sorry.
How many times I gotta tell you?

You said the park of magnolia was your spot, you didn't say anything about this.
Any place there's a ramp.

Twerp.

Accident or not..

[Downtown parkade, public parking]
Come on, come on, hurry up!
No, no, no!
Wow!
Hey!
What are you doing?
You're going to the frat party?
- Where did he go?
- Move gentleman, away!
What's your problem?
- Problem again?
- I'm in trouble still.
You should use some of your movements in your game, Jack.
Kick some butt.
This ain't the gaming world Mr. Chang, this is real world.
One's get nothing to do with the other.
- Bravery is bravery.
- Look at me.
Do I..
Do I even look like I have one awesome brave in me?
Looking and being are 2 different things, young Jack.
On this case..
Here what you see is what you get.
Well, let's see if I can get some work out of my employee.
Yeah okay.
How are thing at home?
Moms worried about money.
Real estate markets dead.
She hasn't sold anything in months.
Looks like we're gonna have to move.
Wish I could do something to help her out.
Medical app or something?
What's all this?
The new shipment from my cousin in Beijing.
Help me open it.
- Mr. Chang what's this?
- It has been in my family since..
Forever.
- You like it?
- Yeah I do.
- The dancing Princess.
- Yeah looks like she's breaking.
- You know, like..
- Oh god..
See look?
I don't think so young Jack.
She lived a long..
Long..
Time ago.
She saved a country from the barbarians.
Talk about brave, she was brave.
This little girl can kick butt big time.
Where do I put it?
- How about your house?
- What do you mean?
I mean..
A present..
- No Mr. Chang..
I can't..
I can't..
- Oh sure you can.
You watch the shop while I going on vacations.
- Oh but you already paying me for that.
- Bad manners to refuse a gift.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- Hey so I have an idea.
- What?
This house..
Really kinda too big for both of us.
I mean when dad was here it was fine.
But now..
You know..
Maybe we should think about renting our room hall.
To that some kid from university or something.
What did I do to deserve a kid like you?
On the lottery?
Night.
- Where is the black knight?
- What?
Hey!
Where is the black knight?
- I..
I'm the black knight.
- You lie!
You die!
Black knight, it's octo man.
- Hey wait, wait.
- I'll challenge you to a duel to death.
It is a video game!
It's a video game!
Okay?
I just..
I just want to show you man.
I'm 8 arms now bro.
Okay you see that's the challenger and that's me, the black knight.
It is true..
Yeah it's me, hey look when I move..
He moves.
Fight!
You are the winner.
Just you wait man, when I'm comeback with 12 arms.
- So you are the black knight.
- In the game world, I'm the black knight.
In this world I'm Jack Bronson.
Jack Bronson worthless to me.
But I don't have a choice.
Jack Bronson, I need your help.
For what?
I need you to guard the most precious treasure of the empire.
Excuse me?
Your majesty, you can go out.
The Princess and future empress.
Hi, I'm Jack.
Anyone who touches the Princess dies.
That is the rule.
No exceptions?
There's no point in having rule if you have exception.
Sometimes is good to be a little flexible.
It's useless.
But I don't have a choice.
I'll be back as soon as possible.
If anything happens to her..
I'm hallucinating, this is crazy, this isn't happening, this isn't happening.
- Where are your-weapons?
- My weapons?
Warrior zhao said you were going to protect me.
To protect me you need to have skills and weapons.
Hey you know, I..
I think warrior zhao a little confuse because..
I'm not the black knight.
I don't have skills or weapons.
So warrior zhao was right, you are worthless.
Okay you know what?
Can we start over?
I'm Jack..
- What do I call you?
- Your highness.
- I need a name.
- Sulin.
- Okay.
- I'm hungry Jack.
Bring be swallow nest soup.
Roasted snail, the big kind.
Oh and duck tongue in hot chilli sauce.
Let's see what I can do.
[Music]
Not bad.
Su lin?
No, no, no, no.
Hey, just in time.
Hey, how's your sleep?
Great, how did your sleep?
Good.
- Do want to sit down?
- Umm, no, no.
Because I read that it's better for your digestion if you're standing.
I never heard it.
Okay, I'll do the dishes.
No, no, I'll do it mom, I do it mom, I'll do dishes today.
Excuse me, what?
You have to go to work, the bridge's down, this traffic, you can be late.
- The bridge?
- Yeah.
No, you gotta go, you're gonna be late.
- Okay I need my keys..
- Got it, please... ok.
Hey, I am gonna go see aunt Sophie tomorrow, do you wanna come with?
Oh no, I gotta a lot stuff to do, like homework.
Yeah, bye bye.
Okay, you gotta come inside.
Hey, I am not joking.
God!
Ok, stay here, don't move.
Whaddup, man?

So, how do you like my octopus, bro?
Lame.
Damn, it's a prototype, yo, just gimme some time.
- I'll be killing it 8 arms and shit.
- Hello.
Hello?
You gonna intro me, bro?
- This is Hector.
- Octoman, yo.
Octoman, this is your highness.
- Really?
That's her name?
- Yeah, that's it.
Well, pound it up, your highness.
No!
Oh dude, I am so sorry.
I am sorry, you ok?
Yeah, it's cool man, I kinda worry, you know.
So what's the story here?
It's complicated, I don't really want talk about it right now.
- You know what I mean.
- Dude, the girl is hot.
- You're gonna hook up?
- No, if you keep ask..
Me stupid questions like that.
You tell me all about that, right?
- Until the last detail.
- Right, catch you two lovebirds later.
You can't do that!
- He want to hit me.
- No, he want to fist bump you!
It's a greeting like a handshake.
Didn't you hear warrior zhao?
No one can touch a Princess, you get your heap chopped off.
- That's the rule.
- Ok, maybe where you come from..
That's the rule, but here, here the rules are different.
When you go back to your world, you can chop off as many heads as you want, I promise.
But here, my world my rule, ok?
Ok.
No!
- What are you doing?
- Observing your world, so I can learn the rules better.
No, no, no, you have to go back inside.
How am I gonna to learn rules of your world if I don't see it?
Well you can go out dressed like that.
- Why not?
- Because..
Because, they will stare and wonder what the hell is going on.
If I were dressed differently could I stand here?
- Yes.
- Then call the tailor and have him..
- Make me new cloth.
- We don't get our clothes from the tailor.
Then take me where you do.
This for man.
- You okay?
- What's that?
- That's ice cream, it's food.
- What that feels like?
Well, it's cold and sweet.
I want one.
Ok what flavor do you want?
They have chocolate, vanilla, strawberry, cherry and mint..
Umm, I want all of them.
All of them?
Ok.
Ok.
- Girl, you're the shit.
- Hey hey, it's your ice cream.
- Yeah, we gotta go.
- That was fun.
- Yeah, really?
- I like them all, Jack, thank you for bringing me here.
You're welcome.
What do you mean I'm the shit?
When you really like something, that's what we say.
Hey mom.
- Hello.
- I ate ice cream.
Yeah, I can see that.
Mom, I forget to tell you.
Yesterday in school they asked someone to volunteer..
To take an exchange student, and...
- Sulin showed up today.
- Oh you fresh out of the boat.
No boat, I came by box.
- What?
- Oh she meant plane.
Plane, because box and plane are the same in her language.
What's the plane?
- She does it all the time.
- I thought she just gotten here.
- She did.
- But you just said all the time.
I did, I meant that in the time she's been here.
- Are you ok with this?
- Yeah, I mean..
- No, no, no.
- Sulin, it's so nice to meet you.
I am Jack's mom, I am Annie.
I am so hungry.
I am sure we have salad, fresh corn and..
Hamburger.
Sulin do you like hamburgers?
I like snails, like Jack and me last night.
Last night?
The Chinese grammar, they get their past and future tenses mixed up a lot.
You know you're acting very weird.
Why don't you put the burgers on?
Su lin and I will go make up the couch and the guess room for her.
I'm gonna be gone tomorrow but maybe when I get back we can get to know each other little better?
Maybe we can go to the mall, it's the shit.
- Who told you that?
- Jack.
Umm, this is where you gonna be sleeping.
- She said that?
- To my mom.
- That is ill dude.
- Hector, give me a break.
I don't know, man, the girl is hot.
Things I would do to her..
Good night Hector.
Excuse me, the bed next door is in the wrong position.
Very bad feng shui, I can't sleep.
This one good feng shui.
Don't forget to clean the house.
Oh don't worry, you won't recognize the place when get back.
- Say hi to aunt Sophie.
- Sure.
- Where is she?
- Who the hell are you?
- Where is the Princess?
- Listen man, I don't know, ok?
I am here.
No, no, no!
Jack!
Jack!
Jack!
Jack!
Jack!
Jack!
Ok, I told you not to let her outta of your sight.
- You worthless!
- I am not a warrior!
I don't know what you're expecting.
I was expecting more.
Ok, well how about this for more, when I saw she was taken by those..
Whatever the hell those I jumped in and after them, man, ok?
What more do you want?
And by the way, we came the same way seconds apart, she should be here.
- She's not.
- Well where is she then?
- I don't know.
- How you could not know?
I was right behind her.
I was busy!
Maybe she came in and ran out.
She probably outside.
Wait, don't!
Oops.
Ok, ok.
I don't want you to think I am backing out on you, but it's not, you know, I got a lot of homework to do..
So I should getting back by now, just go back to where I came.
It's not gonna happen.
So I am stuck here, there's no other way out?
I didn't say that.
- I am not in charge of transportation.
- Well who is?
- The wizard it is.
- And where's the wizard?
Jack Bronson, I won't do that.
- Wake up!
- Stop!
Never wake a sleeping wizard.
What?
I'll get my head chopped off?
Yes, how did you know?
Lucky guess.
What is it with you people chopping off heads?
I mean, really.
It's effective.
Close the door!
Cut the rope!
Get behind me!
Open the door.
There's like thousands of..
Just open it.
Ok.
Sorry.
Hello, what is your name, young man?
- Jack.
- Oh Jack, welcome Jack.
Is something wrong?
No, you just look a lot like someone I know.
Is he handsome?
Yes.
Ok, now let's go find the Princess.
- Can you explain something to me?
- If I can.
- Well let's start with the chest.
- The warrior's gate.
- That's the real name.
- And how does it work?
That's complicated.
It has to do with times, spaces, magic..
And things beyond explaining.
The main thing is that it's works.
- Then how do I get back.
- Another chest.
There's another chest?
Great, where is it?
Well, that is complicated.
I have to collect four different woods..
From 4 different trees that grow in four different parts of the country.
North where zippa wood is found.
South where the spotted bamboo grows.
East where the black mahogany lives.
And west where the rarest tree in all the land is found.
That's the only way to build a new box.
But first let's find the Princess.
You know where she is?
Another complicated question.
How about an easy one, huh?
Zhao.
Tell me about zhao.
That's easy.
Warrior zhao was one of the seven companions..
Raised from birth by the sacred monks..
For one thing and one thing only.
To protect the emperor.
The monks train the 7 companions day and night, year in and year out, until they would be most invincible force.
It was their sole purpose in life to protect the emperor..
While brought peace to the land.
There was not a man alive who could defeat them.
Except one.
Arun the cruel, king of barbarians.
As fate would have it.
Zhao was on the mission and they figure it out.
The food has been poisoned.
Feeling the worse.
He rush to protect the emperor.
But he arrived too late.
And then chaos descended from the north.
And the peace that emperor had work so hard to built began to fall apart.
With no leader the army was lost.
The people were lost.
The zhao fought relentlessly but as great as warrior as he was.
He needed a help of the greatest warrior that could be found.
And so, by using the cynic stone.
I found you.
Yes.
And we pass through the warriors gate to get help protecting the greatest treasure we possessed.
- Shuman?
- Sulin.
The only one who can rally the people to defeat.
The barbarians and save our kingdoms.
But I'm not be able to help him.
He thinks I am worthless.
Oh, you seems might.
But I don't.
- Based on what?
- You're here.
You didn't have to be.
You could've stay at home.
That's something about who you are.
Am I crazy?
And now if you will excuse me.
I have a lot of wood to collect.
See you.
Bye-bye.
Come on, let's go.
You know the old saying about blaming the burial is bad news.
Yes, your highness.
- You believe it's true?
- I hope not, your highness.
Good news, you're getting marry.
Bad news.
Warrior zhao is on his way.
Kill him.
Brutus, not him, kill zhao.
Ups.
- So, I assumed you have a plan.
- I do.
Save the Princess.
Prevent the married.
Oh?
She is getting married?
Force to.
Unless we stop it.
- Ah..
Who is the groom?
- Arun the cruel.
Ah, is it his name?
His full name is arum the cruel, the horrible, the terrible, the miserable.
But we keep it short.
If the marry takes place..
Once she become empress, he become emperor.
And once he is an emperor.
He will kill her and the whole country is doom.
Are you finish with dinner?
- I guess.
- Yeah, we sleep.
I know, I know, we are rafting it but do we have any, blankets and pillows?
Blankets?
No.
Pillows.
Yes.
Good night.
Let say you have rescue the Princess.
- Is she have anyone else might to marry?
- Not yet.
Any idea what kind husband she looking for?
Cause in the little time we spend together, you know what?
I thought we have something.
You know, connection.
Cause we like the same clothes, we like the same musics.
- You know, you don't think that..
- No, I don't think, Jack Bronson.
She's looking for someone good, someone brave, a hero.
Yeah.
Seized in the right of capital of chunghai province.
1.600 bricks of silver, 18.000 bricks of gold. 6 chests of diamonds.
And 26 slaves.
- Only 26 slaves?
- Yes, I know.
We're under performing in that department.
Who is in charge of slaves?
My cousin.
Get rid of him.
Brutus, I mean the cousin.
Not him!
Ups.
A second moment here, big fella.
Now, I know you want to please me, but next time..
Before you kill someone.
Should we have a signal, maybe?
Like, something like that?
Like, signal?
Like that?
A signal like that?
- Like that?
Yes.
- Kill.
That's the signal.
- Yes.
- That's the signal.
Your highness.
- Get her down.
- Finally.
Beautiful bride has arrive.
Hello, my love.
How are you?
Tired from your long trip.
- Need a hot bath?
- Stay there!
- A hunk of milk, maybe?
- Hold!

You and me.
Let's move!
You and me!
- Go!
Go!

- What are you doing?
- It's gonna rain.
There's no cloud.
Not all rain come from cloud.
Oh my god!
Oh my god!
Look at this!
What the hell is going on?
He wants me dead.
- So they know we are here?
- They know we're somewhere around here.
So they're just keep shooting arrows everywhere and hope to get lucky.
We called it the morning shower.
Why don't you wake me up?
I could been dead.
If I want you dead, I will do it myself.
You have to learn to listen.
- What is said?
- Do not enter.
- And what's in there?
- The unknown land.
- What is in the unknown land?
- Unknown things.
Okay, wait, but..
You are drop me off to the wizard, right?
- Wrong.
- Okay, look, I really think..
Is about time we thought about getting me home?
- So do I. Here.
- What is this?
A map.
It will take you to the wizard.
I..
I can't read this.
I just want to go home and you are not helping.
- I gave you a map.
- So basically it's screw you, Jack.
I brought you here against your will, I kidnapped you, and now you're not the person I though you were.
So, adios amigo.
You are not my problem.
Wrong at number one.
I did not kidnap you.
No one need you jump into that chest.
Right on number two.
You are not my problem.
My problem is to get through the unknown land.
Get pass the arum's army.
Pass his personal guards.
Pass the terror guards.
Find the Princess, get pass the tower's reinforcement.
Pass the personal guard's reinforcement.
Kill arum.
And then bring the Princess back so she can be made empress who save the country.
That is my problem.
So you're saying I don't have a choice.
You do have a choice.
You can save yourself or you can save her.
- I can't save a Princess!
- You are the black knight.
- Oh, yeah, I almost forgot.
- Sir, sir..
Sir..
Good news.
Don't be nervous.
It's been my lucky days so far.
- And I've good feeling about this one.
- Yes, sire.
I'm sure, it's good news.
Bad news.
- No, impossible..
- No sign of warrior zhao.
Sire... sire..
Brutus..
No, no..
- Signal, you remember, the signal?
- Signal?
- Kill him!
- No, no, no, no!
Sire!
Sire!
I was thinking.
This arum dude, maybe if he gets what he want, he'll change, you know.
Be like arum the kind?
Do you have people in your world who get what they want by threating to do bad things?
At least there is one kid.
And you give him what he wants.
Does he change?
Not really.
Might does not make right, Jack.
Right makes right.
If you don't stand up for what is right, and why you stand up at all?
You know, that's easy to say.
This, this kid, he is bigger then me.
He's stronger then me.
So what do you do?
- I run.
- Is that solve your problem?
No.
- So you got a girl?
- No.
- Because?
- Because I had my job.
What are your job doesn't have time for personal life?
My job is my life.
Yeah, it's like much fun.
Pardon?
Yeah, you know.
Do things make you feel good.
I feel good doing my job.

I don't have time for fun.
Man, come on.

Wow.
Excuse me.

And I need to finish cooking my soup.
How long is that going to take?

We don't have all night.
You do now.
Perhaps, if we move the..
- Respect your elder one!
- No disrespect.
But we have very important mission.
We have to get through.

In your ear.

As much I like to make you happy, your dying is not on you, love.
However, feeling insist someone dying, it can be arrange.
Keep her away.
Come on!
Come inside!

Invisible woman.
How is the priest people in place boxes and time travel, and none of us are weird, is it?
It's not weird.
It just magic.
We don't have magic.
Then how you do explain what cannot be explain?
We have sains.
Sains is everything.
- Does sains explain rainbow or snowflakes?
- Yes.
But does it explain how you feel when you see the rainbow or snowflake?
- No.
Feeling aren't magic.
- So you do have magic.
- What are they then?
- I don't know.
The feeling.
Okay, they make you do and say things you normally wouldn't do or say, like, like..
If you met this girl that you never knew.
And all the sudden there's..
Can't think anything to say but you can't stop talking.
And your body like hot and cold in the same time and...
Your heart is beating like you just run a mile in a minute... and it's..
It's like..
Magic?
Yeah, I guess.
Help!
Help!
Are you okay?

Come on, let me down!
[Screaming]
Zhao!
Zhao!
Zhao!
Zhao!
Help!
Zhao!
Zhao!
Aw!
He's a cute one.
Cute one always taste better.
Oh, no.
The fat ones taste better.
The fat ones give me dash.
If you let the blood out, he'll cooked faster.
[Laughing]
No!
No!
No!
Get away from him!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Zhao!
Hey, since it seems we're in trouble every 20 minutes...
Maybe it could be good if you showed me a few moves.
Just in case.
Martial arts take many years to learn.
No, I'm not asking for the whole menu.
Just a little something.
Martial arts do notwork with a little something.
Well then, a lot of something.
Anything.
Even if I can do one thing to help out the next time we're in a situation.
Just give me something so I have a fighting chance.
Please.
[Sighs]
Come on.
Come on.
Get up.
Stand a feet apart.
Oh, this is cool.
Bend your knees.
Sorry.
Okay.
Now imagine... there's a big tree in front of you.
Do you see it?
Yeah.
Is it big?
Yeah.
Okay.
Now, hug it.
Do what?
I mean hug the tree.
Good.
- That's it?
- That's it.
Well, how long do I have to stay like this?
[Sighs]
You know if you're not gonna teach me, you should just say so.
I am teaching you.
Yeah.
Right.
Thanks.
Thanks a lot.
Hey.
Hey, wait.
What are you doing?
Come on.
Now, pay attention.
The secret of all martial arts is the circle.
When you moved, the circle moves with you.
Here, let me show you.
Hit me.
Hit me again.
Again.
To understand the circle, you must make the circle...
Live the circle, now, the circle is you..
And you are the circle.
Understand?
We move the moment she says "I do".
First on me.
Directly for the capital.
Second army.
To the ocean.
And the third army?
We have a third army?
Yes.
Just let them robbing village.
Excuse me, sir.
For the wedding canopy.
Red or blue?
Red or blue, my love?
[Laughing]
Oops.
And this is called not good.
Why, it's beautiful?
Yes, it is.
But the fortress is over there.
And it could take days to walk all the way around the lake.
Or we could just swim across in no time.
[Sighs]
No, Jack.
It's not possible.
Why, are there man-eating fish in there?
No.
- Poisonous snakes?
- Nope.
- Dragons?
- Not this time of year.
So, what's in it that's a problem?
I cannot swim.
You kidding me?
You... you who can kick the butts of the entire NFL at the same time...
And you can't swim, what's wrong with this picture?
They never taught...
Yeah.
Oh, come on.
Where you're going?
There's no time to waste.
You're gonna walk?
We don't have a choice.
Okay, you gotta get over this "you don't have a choice" thing, alright?
You do have a choice.
You're strong and you're coordinated.
Alright, maybe, we can work something else, okay?
I teach you to swim, you teach me more...
Deal?
[Sighs]
Come on.
Ooh...
You can do it.
You can do it, come on.
- Trust me.
- [Sighs]
Hey, that's it.
There you go.
Now, put the shield on.
Now, hop on.
- Ooh...
- Hey.
There you go.
You having fun?
Yeah.
I bet you didn't get too much of that, growing up the way you did.
Fun?
No.
So, if you can make up for that...
Maybe you can come visit me.
I'll show you around, maybe get my mom to take us to Disneyland or something.
I told you.
I can never take off from my job.
Hey, man, look... you... you really got to get a life.
When you're responsible for a life, you don't have a life.
Okay.
You...
You like go to school to learn how say things like that?
Like what?
When you're responsible for a life, you don't have a life.
What's wrong with it?
Nothing is wrong, but that, it's just...
Sound smart.
It does?
Yeah, it does.
[Chuckles]
Cool.
So, what's in Disneyland?
A lot of princesses.
Oh.
- A Chinese one, too.
- Oh.
- Our king will win!
- Our king will win!
Get down, get down, get down!
So, you... you do have a plan, right?
I've told you the plan.
Ah, right.
Get past the army.
- Yes.
- Get past the personal guards.
- Correct.
- Get past the tower guards.
Find the Princess.
- Get past reinforcements?
- Good.
- Kill arun.
- Exactly.
Crowned sulin in person saved the country.
You learning to listen.
Yeah.
The real questions is...
Do you have a plan to execute...
The plan?
Hmm?
Ah, I mean...
- Who will win?
- Our king will win!
Our king will win!
Good morning.
Hmm?
Great plan.
- Are we in the fortress?
- Yeah.
- Are we passed the army?
- Yeah.
Have we passed the personal guards?
Almost.
Well then, I think the plan is working.
I think the plan to get in is working.
How about the plan to get out?
I'm working on it.
Warrior zhao.
I'm so honored, that you've come all this way to attend my wedding.
I'm not here to attend your wedding.
I'm here to attend your funeral.
[Laughing]
And you are?
He's the black knight.
I'm not the black knight, okay?
I'm...
I'm Jack Bronson.
Jack Bronson.
I've got good news.
And I have bad news.
The good news is...
Tomorrow... when my bride and I are married.
We will stand... there.
And you two... will stand...
There.
Okay, what's the bad news?
As soon as we've taken our vows...
You know, new life begins...
Your life ends.
He's not bluffing, is he?
Arun doesn't do bluffs.
Even maybe he'll be feeling generous 'cause it his wedding day, and he'll pardon us.
Arun doesn't do generous.
Okay, if he doesn't do this and he doesn't do that...
Is there anything that he does do?
Well, he rapes, murders, and pillagers.
I guess in another words we're dead.
When one door closes, another one opens.
See?
Dinner is served.
[Humming]
Urgh...
I was not expecting that.
It's time to eat.
Uh... excuse me?
Uh... would you mind...
You know, so we can...
Thank you.
Here.
[Chuckles]
Guys, I'm..
I'm looking for the Princess.
You know where she is?
[Screaming]
What now?
Now is the time to use what I've taught you.
I'm not ready.
Of course, you are.
You're the black knight.
You have skills.
Okay, I don't...
I don't get it.
'Cause, one minute you told me I'm worthless, and after a few lessons, I'm not?
It's not just me who thinks you're not worthless, Jack.
The way the Princess looks at you..
She believes in you.
- She does?
- Now, go rescue her.
Go!
What's up?
Hmm?
[Indistinct shouts]
- Jack!
Jack!
- Oh!
You okay?
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah.
You came to save me.
I guess.
I knew you will.
You did?
From the very first.
Princess!
Zhao.
- Are you alright?
- I'm alright.
I'm sorry I came late to save you.
Okay, plan, we did it.
Um...
How do we get out of here?
I'm working on it.
You better work fast, they're coming.
[Shouting]

Amazing animals.

Nurse them when they were sick.
They are more loyal than all my men.
They would die for me.
As well the two of you.
And you my dear..
By this time tomorrow, you and I will be husband and wife.
Emperor and empress.
Allow me, my love.

And my whole life head to me.
There's a million things I'm never gonna be able to do.
Like what?
Dude, I never been kiss a girl.
Me neither.
You know, I was that close before you came to the room.
Yeah.
That's not the point.
- With the Princess?
How close?
- That's not the point.
- What was that?
- A butterfly.
- You spoke to the butterfly?
- Apparently.
- Are they understood you?
- Hopefully.
[Sobbing]
Long live the king!

You were warrior from the beginning, Jack.

Why you doing this, son?
You're not a warrior.
Not even a grow man.
Leave her alone and I let you live.
- You leave her alone, and I let you live.
- Let me think about it.
No.
I think I'll stay here.
And I will take one leg.
Your other leg.
Now take your arm.

You're the shit.
Thanks.
Hello, zhao.
The empress request your present.
Okay, I'm just waiting the wizard.
Jack, if the empress summon you, you must come at once.
- He said he'll be right back.
- It is the rule.
Or what, huh?
Get my head chop off?
You guys and your rules, man.
So I guess it's the rules to smile.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Wow.
What?
Sure I'm not gonna have my head chop off?
- There's no one here to see.
- Okay.
I wanted to see you before you went back.
Actually I wish I could go with you.
- Even for one day.
- You are the empress now.
You can do whatever you want.
Because I'm the empress I can't.
Every minutes of everyday from now on will be filled with.
Ministers, ambassadors, and paper to signing, decision to make.
- No dancing.
No singing.
- No fun.
I would love to go to the mall to eat ice cream, but..
I..
I can't.
My father worked so hard to bring peace to the whole country.
I can't let him down.
He gave his life for our people I owe it to him.
I understand.
But I did want to thank you for giving me memories that I will always treasured.
I want to give one that I hope you will, too.
I don't think you're worthless.
I never did.
Goodbye, Jack.
He touched the empress.
He must to die!
Hey..
Hey!
Wizard!
Wizard!

Got it.

No I gotta go now.

- I gotta go.
Here you see?
Okay.
- It's not ready yet?
Come on, hurry!
- Relax.
Jack!
So after all we've been through?
- You gotta kill me, really?
- Rules are rules.
If we do not live by them, we'll be nothing more than barbarians.
Unless we can make an exception.
- Sometimes good to be a little flexible, right?
- I hate you.
Here.
Thank you.
Good bye, Jack Bronson.
I will never forget you and the lesson you taught me.
It's done.
The last missing piece to put.
I might learned to be flexible but they haven't.
- Hurry up.
Let's go.
- Yes.
- Come on, man.
Get it in.
- Let's go.
- Go..
Go!
- Come on!
Jack?
Hi, mom.

6 months, not a house..
Not an apartment.
Hey Mr. Chang says everything happens for a reason..
Yeah, you know what?
Well Mr. Chang is not getting his home foreclosed down in 90 days.
I'm sorry.
I know hes your friend and..
It's really sweet of him to give you a job and everything, but..
We don't need philosophy.
We need a break.

- Oh it's fine.
- No more bully.

Hey!
What are you doing?
You're going to the frat party?
- Where did he go?
- Move gentleman, away!
What's your problem?
- Problem again?
- I'm in trouble still.
You should use some of your movements in your game, Jack.
Kick some butt.
This ain't the gaming world Mr. Chang, this is real world.
One's get nothing to do with the other.
- Bravery is bravery.
- Look at me.
Do I..
Do I even look like I have one awesome brave in me?
Looking and being are 2 different things, young Jack.
On this case..
Here what you see is what you get.
Well, let's see if I can get some work out of my employee.
Yeah okay.
How are thing at home?
Moms worried about money.
Real estate markets dead.
She hasn't sold anything in months.
Looks like we're gonna have to move.
Wish I could do something to help her out.
Medical app or something?
What's all this?
The new shipment from my cousin in Beijing.
Help me open it.
- Mr. Chang what's this?
- It has been in my family since..
Forever.
- You like it?
- Yeah I do.
- The dancing Princess.
- Yeah looks like she's breaking.
- You know, like..
- Oh god..
See look?
I don't think so young Jack.
She lived a long..
Long..
Time ago.
She saved a country from the barbarians.
Talk about brave, she was brave.
This little girl can kick butt big time.
Where do I put it?
- How about your house?
- What do you mean?
I mean..
A present..
- No Mr. Chang..
I can't..
I can't..
- Oh sure you can.
You watch the shop while I going on vacations.
- Oh but you already paying me for that.
- Bad manners to refuse a gift.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- Hey so I have an idea.
- What?
This house..
Really kinda too big for both of us.
I mean when dad was here it was fine.
But now..
You know..
Maybe we should think about renting our room hall.
To that some kid from university or something.
What did I do to deserve a kid like you?
On the lottery?
Night.
- Where is the black knight?
- What?
Hey!
Where is the black knight?
- I..
I'm the black knight.
- You lie!
You die!
Black knight, it's octo man.
- Hey wait, wait.
- I'll challenge you to a duel to death.
It is a video game!
It's a video game!
Okay?
I just..
I just want to show you man.
I'm 8 arms now bro.
Okay you see that's the challenger and that's me, the black knight.
It is true..
Yeah it's me, hey look when I move..
He moves.
Fight!
You are the winner.
Just you wait man, when I'm comeback with 12 arms.

- In the game world, I'm the black knight.
In this world I'm Jack Bronson.
Jack Bronson worthless to me.
But I don't have a choice.
Jack Bronson, I need your help.
For what?
I need you to guard the most precious treasure of the empire.
Excuse me?
Your majesty, you can go out.
The Princess and future empress.
Hi, I'm Jack.
Anyone who touches the Princess dies.
That is the rule.
No exceptions?
There's no point in having rule if you have exception.
Sometimes is good to be a little flexible.
It's useless.
But I don't have a choice.
I'll be back as soon as possible.
If anything happens to her..
I'm hallucinating, this is crazy, this isn't happening, this isn't happening.
- Where are your-weapons?
- My weapons?
Warrior zhao said you were going to protect me.
To protect me you need to have skills and weapons.
Hey you know, I..
I think warrior zhao a little confuse because..
I'm not the black knight.
I don't have skills or weapons.
So warrior zhao was right, you are worthless.
Okay you know what?
Can we start over?
I'm Jack..
- What do I call you?
- Your highness.
- I need a name.
- Sulin.
- Okay.
- I'm hungry Jack.

Roasted snail, the big kind.
Oh and duck tongue in hot chilli sauce.

Not bad.
Su lin?
No, no, no, no.
Hey, just in time.
Hey, how's your sleep?
Great, how did your sleep?
Good.
- Do want to sit down?
- Umm, no, no.
Because I read that it's better for your digestion if you're standing.
I never heard it.
Okay, I'll do the dishes.
No, no, I'll do it mom, I do it mom, I'll do dishes today.
Excuse me, what?
You have to go to work, the bridge's down, this traffic, you can be late.
- The bridge?
- Yeah.
No, you gotta go, you're gonna be late.
- Okay I need my keys..
- Got it, please... ok.
Hey, I am gonna go see aunt Sophie tomorrow, do you wanna come with?
Oh no, I gotta a lot stuff to do, like homework.

Okay, you gotta come inside.

- Yeah, that's it.
Well, pound it up, your highness.
No!
Oh dude, I am so sorry.
I am sorry, you ok?
Yeah, it's cool man, I kinda worry, you know.
So what's the story here?
It's complicated, I don't really want talk about it right now.
- You know what I mean.
- Dude, the girl is hot.
- You're gonna hook up?
- No, if you keep ask..
Me stupid questions like that.
You tell me all about that, right?
- Until the last detail.
- Right, catch you two lovebirds later.
You can't do that!
- He want to hit me.
- No, he want to fist bump you!
It's a greeting like a handshake.
Didn't you hear warrior zhao?
No one can touch a Princess, you get your heap chopped off.
- That's the rule.
- Ok, maybe where you come from..
That's the rule, but here, here the rules are different.
When you go back to your world, you can chop off as many heads as you want, I promise.
But here, my world my rule, ok?
Ok.
No!
- What are you doing?
- Observing your world, so I can learn the rules better.
No, no, no, you have to go back inside.
How am I gonna to learn rules of your world if I don't see it?
Well you can go out dressed like that.
- Why not?
- Because..
Because, they will stare and wonder what the hell is going on.
If I were dressed differently could I stand here?
- Yes.
- Then call the tailor and have him..
- Make me new cloth.
- We don't get our clothes from the tailor.
Then take me where you do.
This for man.
- You okay?
- What's that?
- That's ice cream, it's food.
- What that feels like?
Well, it's cold and sweet.
I want one.
Ok what flavor do you want?
They have chocolate, vanilla, strawberry, cherry and mint..
Umm, I want all of them.
All of them?
Ok.
Ok.
- Girl, you're the shit.
- Hey hey, it's your ice cream.
- Yeah, we gotta go.
- That was fun.
- Yeah, really?
- I like them all, Jack, thank you for bringing me here.
You're welcome.
What do you mean I'm the shit?
When you really like something, that's what we say.
Hey mom.
- Hello.
- I ate ice cream.
Yeah, I can see that.
Mom, I forget to tell you.
Yesterday in school they asked someone to volunteer..
To take an exchange student, and...
- Sulin showed up today.
- Oh you fresh out of the boat.
No boat, I came by box.
- What?
- Oh she meant plane.
Plane, because box and plane are the same in her language.
What's the plane?
- She does it all the time.
- I thought she just gotten here.
- She did.
- But you just said all the time.
I did, I meant that in the time she's been here.
- Are you ok with this?
- Yeah, I mean..
- No, no, no.
- Sulin, it's so nice to meet you.
I am Jack's mom, I am Annie.
I am so hungry.
I am sure we have salad, fresh corn and..
Hamburger.
Sulin do you like hamburgers?
I like snails, like Jack and me last night.
Last night?
The Chinese grammar, they get their past and future tenses mixed up a lot.
You know you're acting very weird.
Why don't you put the burgers on?
Su lin and I will go make up the couch and the guess room for her.
I'm gonna be gone tomorrow but maybe when I get back we can get to know each other little better?
Maybe we can go to the mall, it's the shit.
- Who told you that?
- Jack.
Umm, this is where you gonna be sleeping.
- She said that?
- To my mom.
- That is ill dude.
- Hector, give me a break.
I don't know, man, the girl is hot.
Things I would do to her..
Good night Hector.
Excuse me, the bed next door is in the wrong position.
Very bad feng shui, I can't sleep.
This one good feng shui.
Don't forget to clean the house.
Oh don't worry, you won't recognize the place when get back.
- Say hi to aunt Sophie.
- Sure.
- Where is she?
- Who the hell are you?
- Where is the Princess?
- Listen man, I don't know, ok?
I am here.
No, no, no!
Jack!
Jack!
Jack!
Jack!
Jack!
Jack!
Ok, I told you not to let her outta of your sight.
- You worthless!
- I am not a warrior!
I don't know what you're expecting.
I was expecting more.
Ok, well how about this for more, when I saw she was taken by those..
Whatever the hell those I jumped in and after them, man, ok?
What more do you want?
And by the way, we came the same way seconds apart, she should be here.
- She's not.
- Well where is she then?
- I don't know.
- How you could not know?
I was right behind her.
I was busy!
Maybe she came in and ran out.
She probably outside.
Wait, don't!
Oops.
Ok, ok.
I don't want you to think I am backing out on you, but it's not, you know, I got a lot of homework to do..
So I should getting back by now, just go back to where I came.
It's not gonna happen.
So I am stuck here, there's no other way out?
I didn't say that.
- I am not in charge of transportation.
- Well who is?
- The wizard it is.
- And where's the wizard?
Jack Bronson, I won't do that.
- Wake up!
- Stop!
Never wake a sleeping wizard.
What?
I'll get my head chopped off?
Yes, how did you know?
Lucky guess.
What is it with you people chopping off heads?
I mean, really.
It's effective.
Close the door!
Cut the rope!
Get behind me!
Open the door.
There's like thousands of..
Just open it.
Ok.
Sorry.
Hello, what is your name, young man?
- Jack.
- Oh Jack, welcome Jack.
Is something wrong?
No, you just look a lot like someone I know.
Is he handsome?
Yes.
Ok, now let's go find the Princess.
- Can you explain something to me?
- If I can.
- Well let's start with the chest.
- The warrior's gate.
- That's the real name.
- And how does it work?
That's complicated.
It has to do with times, spaces, magic..
And things beyond explaining.
The main thing is that it's works.
- Then how do I get back.
- Another chest.
There's another chest?
Great, where is it?
Well, that is complicated.
I have to collect four different woods..
From 4 different trees that grow in four different parts of the country.
North where zippa wood is found.
South where the spotted bamboo grows.
East where the black mahogany lives.
And west where the rarest tree in all the land is found.
That's the only way to build a new box.
But first let's find the Princess.
You know where she is?
Another complicated question.
How about an easy one, huh?
Zhao.
Tell me about zhao.
That's easy.
Warrior zhao was one of the seven companions..
Raised from birth by the sacred monks..
For one thing and one thing only.
To protect the emperor.
The monks train the 7 companions day and night, year in and year out, until they would be most invincible force.
It was their sole purpose in life to protect the emperor..
While brought peace to the land.
There was not a man alive who could defeat them.
Except one.
Arun the cruel, king of barbarians.
As fate would have it.
Zhao was on the mission and they figure it out.
The food has been poisoned.
Feeling the worse.
He rush to protect the emperor.
But he arrived too late.
And then chaos descended from the north.
And the peace that emperor had work so hard to built began to fall apart.
With no leader the army was lost.
The people were lost.
The zhao fought relentlessly but as great as warrior as he was.
He needed a help of the greatest warrior that could be found.
And so, by using the cynic stone.
I found you.
Yes.
And we pass through the warriors gate to get help protecting the greatest treasure we possessed.
- Shuman?
- Sulin.
The only one who can rally the people to defeat.
The barbarians and save our kingdoms.
But I'm not be able to help him.
He thinks I am worthless.
Oh, you seems might.
But I don't.
- Based on what?
- You're here.
You didn't have to be.
You could've stay at home.
That's something about who you are.
Am I crazy?
And now if you will excuse me.
I have a lot of wood to collect.
See you.
Bye-bye.
Come on, let's go.
You know the old saying about blaming the burial is bad news.
Yes, your highness.
- You believe it's true?
- I hope not, your highness.
Good news, you're getting marry.
Bad news.
Warrior zhao is on his way.
Kill him.
Brutus, not him, kill zhao.
Ups.
- So, I assumed you have a plan.
- I do.
Save the Princess.
Prevent the married.
Oh?
She is getting married?
Force to.
Unless we stop it.
- Ah..
Who is the groom?
- Arun the cruel.
Ah, is it his name?
His full name is arum the cruel, the horrible, the terrible, the miserable.
But we keep it short.
If the marry takes place..
Once she become empress, he become emperor.
And once he is an emperor.
He will kill her and the whole country is doom.
Are you finish with dinner?
- I guess.
- Yeah, we sleep.
I know, I know, we are rafting it but do we have any, blankets and pillows?
Blankets?
No.
Pillows.
Yes.
Good night.
Let say you have rescue the Princess.
- Is she have anyone else might to marry?
- Not yet.
Any idea what kind husband she looking for?
Cause in the little time we spend together, you know what?
I thought we have something.
You know, connection.
Cause we like the same clothes, we like the same musics.
- You know, you don't think that..
- No, I don't think, Jack Bronson.
She's looking for someone good, someone brave, a hero.
Yeah.
Seized in the right of capital of chunghai province.
1.600 bricks of silver, 18.000 bricks of gold. 6 chests of diamonds.
And 26 slaves.
- Only 26 slaves?
- Yes, I know.
We're under performing in that department.
Who is in charge of slaves?
My cousin.
Get rid of him.
Brutus, I mean the cousin.
Not him!
Ups.
A second moment here, big fella.
Now, I know you want to please me, but next time..
Before you kill someone.
Should we have a signal, maybe?
Like, something like that?
Like, signal?
Like that?
A signal like that?
- Like that?
Yes.
- Kill.
That's the signal.
- Yes.
- That's the signal.
Your highness.
- Get her down.
- Finally.
Beautiful bride has arrive.
Hello, my love.
How are you?
Tired from your long trip.
- Need a hot bath?
- Stay there!
- A hunk of milk, maybe?
- Hold!
Soon, my love.
Soon.
You and me.
Let's move!
You and me!
- Go!
Go!
- Call the tailor for fitting!
- What are you doing?
- It's gonna rain.
There's no cloud.
Not all rain come from cloud.
Oh my god!
Oh my god!
Look at this!
What the hell is going on?
He wants me dead.
- So they know we are here?
- They know we're somewhere around here.
So they're just keep shooting arrows everywhere and hope to get lucky.
We called it the morning shower.
Why don't you wake me up?
I could been dead.
If I want you dead, I will do it myself.
You have to learn to listen.
- What is said?
- Do not enter.
- And what's in there?
- The unknown land.
- What is in the unknown land?
- Unknown things.
Okay, wait, but..
You are drop me off to the wizard, right?
- Wrong.
- Okay, look, I really think..
Is about time we thought about getting me home?
- So do I. Here.
- What is this?
A map.
It will take you to the wizard.
I..
I can't read this.
I just want to go home and you are not helping.
- I gave you a map.
- So basically it's screw you, Jack.
I brought you here against your will, I kidnapped you, and now you're not the person I though you were.
So, adios amigo.
You are not my problem.
Wrong at number one.
I did not kidnap you.
No one need you jump into that chest.
Right on number two.
You are not my problem.
My problem is to get through the unknown land.
Get pass the arum's army.
Pass his personal guards.
Pass the terror guards.
Find the Princess, get pass the tower's reinforcement.
Pass the personal guard's reinforcement.
Kill arum.
And then bring the Princess back so she can be made empress who save the country.
That is my problem.
So you're saying I don't have a choice.
You do have a choice.
You can save yourself or you can save her.
- I can't save a Princess!
- You are the black knight.
- Oh, yeah, I almost forgot.
- Sir, sir..
Sir..
Good news.
Don't be nervous.
It's been my lucky days so far.
- And I've good feeling about this one.
- Yes, sire.
I'm sure, it's good news.
Bad news.
- No, impossible..
- No sign of warrior zhao.
Sire... sire..
Brutus..
No, no..
- Signal, you remember, the signal?
- Signal?
- Kill him!
- No, no, no, no!
Sire!
Sire!
I was thinking.
This arum dude, maybe if he gets what he want, he'll change, you know.
Be like arum the kind?
Do you have people in your world who get what they want by threating to do bad things?
At least there is one kid.
And you give him what he wants.
Does he change?
Not really.
Might does not make right, Jack.
Right makes right.
If you don't stand up for what is right, and why you stand up at all?
You know, that's easy to say.
This, this kid, he is bigger then me.
He's stronger then me.
So what do you do?
- I run.
- Is that solve your problem?
No.
- So you got a girl?
- No.
- Because?
- Because I had my job.
What are your job doesn't have time for personal life?
My job is my life.

Then how you do explain what cannot be explain?
We have sains.
Sains is everything.

- Yes.
But does it explain how you feel when you see the rainbow or snowflake?

The feeling.
Okay, they make you do and say things you normally wouldn't do or say, like, like..
If you met this girl that you never knew.
And all the sudden there's..

Your heart is beating like you just run a mile in a minute... and it's..

Get away from him!
Help!

Zhao!
Hey, since it seems we're in trouble every 20 minutes...
Maybe it could be good if you showed me a few moves.
Just in case.
Martial arts take many years to learn.
No, I'm not asking for the whole menu.
Just a little something.
Martial arts do notwork with a little something.
Well then, a lot of something.
Anything.
Even if I can do one thing to help out the next time we're in a situation.
Just give me something so I have a fighting chance.
Please.
Come on.
Come on.
Get up.
Stand a feet apart.
Oh, this is cool.
Bend your knees.
Sorry.
Okay.
Now imagine... there's a big tree in front of you.
Do you see it?
Yeah.
Is it big?
Yeah.
Okay.
Now, hug it.
Do what?
I mean hug the tree.
Good.
- That's it?
- That's it.
Well, how long do I have to stay like this?
You know if you're not gonna teach me, you should just say so.
I am teaching you.
Yeah.
Right.
Thanks.
Thanks a lot.
Hey.
Hey, wait.
What are you doing?
Come on.
Now, pay attention.
The secret of all martial arts is the circle.
When you moved, the circle moves with you.
Here, let me show you.
Hit me.
Hit me again.
Again.
To understand the circle, you must make the circle...
Live the circle, now, the circle is you..
And you are the circle.
Understand?
We move the moment she says "I do".
First on me.
Directly for the capital.
Second army.
To the ocean.
And the third army?
We have a third army?
Yes.
Just let them robbing village.
Excuse me, sir.
For the wedding canopy.
Red or blue?
Red or blue, my love?
Oops.
And this is called not good.
Why, it's beautiful?
Yes, it is.
But the fortress is over there.
And it could take days to walk all the way around the lake.
Or we could just swim across in no time.
No, Jack.
It's not possible.
Why, are there man-eating fish in there?
No.
- Poisonous snakes?
- Nope.
- Dragons?
- Not this time of year.
So, what's in it that's a problem?
I cannot swim.
You kidding me?
You... you who can kick the butts of the entire NFL at the same time...
And you can't swim, what's wrong with this picture?
They never taught...
Yeah.
Oh, come on.
Where you're going?
There's no time to waste.
You're gonna walk?
We don't have a choice.
Okay, you gotta get over this "you don't have a choice" thing, alright?
You do have a choice.
You're strong and you're coordinated.
Alright, maybe, we can work something else, okay?
I teach you to swim, you teach me more...
Deal?
Come on.
Ooh...
You can do it.
You can do it, come on.
Trust me.
Hey, that's it.
There you go.
Now, put the shield on.
Now, hop on.
- Ooh...
- Hey.
There you go.
You having fun?
Yeah.
I bet you didn't get too much of that, growing up the way you did.
Fun?
No.
So, if you can make up for that...
Maybe you can come visit me.
I'll show you around, maybe get my mom to take us to Disneyland or something.
I told you.
I can never take off from my job.
Hey, man, look... you... you really got to get a life.
When you're responsible for a life, you don't have a life.
Okay.
You...
You like go to school to learn how say things like that?
Like what?
When you're responsible for a life, you don't have a life.
What's wrong with it?
Nothing is wrong, but that, it's just...
Sound smart.
It does?
Yeah, it does.
Cool.
So, what's in Disneyland?
A lot of princesses.
Oh.
- A Chinese one, too.
- Oh.
- Our king will win!
- Our king will win!
Get down, get down, get down!
So, you... you do have a plan, right?
I've told you the plan.
Ah, right.
Get past the army.
- Yes.
- Get past the personal guards.
- Correct.
- Get past the tower guards.
Find the Princess.
- Get past reinforcements?
- Good.
- Kill arun.
- Exactly.
Crowned sulin in person saved the country.
You learning to listen.
Yeah.
The real questions is...
Do you have a plan to execute...
The plan?
Hmm?
Ah, I mean...
- Who will win?
- Our king will win!
Our king will win!
Good morning.
Hmm?
Great plan.
- Are we in the fortress?
- Yeah.
- Are we passed the army?
- Yeah.
Have we passed the personal guards?
Almost.
Well then, I think the plan is working.
I think the plan to get in is working.
How about the plan to get out?
I'm working on it.
Warrior zhao.
I'm so honored, that you've come all this way to attend my wedding.
I'm not here to attend your wedding.
I'm here to attend your funeral.
And you are?
He's the black knight.
I'm not the black knight, okay?
I'm...
I'm Jack Bronson.
Jack Bronson.
I've got good news.
And I have bad news.
The good news is...
Tomorrow... when my bride and I are married.
We will stand... there.
And you two... will stand...
There.
Okay, what's the bad news?
As soon as we've taken our vows...
You know, new life begins...
Your life ends.
He's not bluffing, is he?
Arun doesn't do bluffs.
Even maybe he'll be feeling generous 'cause it his wedding day, and he'll pardon us.
Arun doesn't do generous.
Okay, if he doesn't do this and he doesn't do that...
Is there anything that he does do?
Well, he rapes, murders, and pillagers.
I guess in another words we're dead.
When one door closes, another one opens.
See?
Dinner is served.
Urgh...
I was not expecting that.
It's time to eat.
Uh... excuse me?
Uh... would you mind...
You know, so we can...
Thank you.
Here.
Guys, I'm..
I'm looking for the Princess.
You know where she is?
What now?
Now is the time to use what I've taught you.
I'm not ready.
Of course, you are.
You're the black knight.
You have skills.
Okay, I don't...
I don't get it.
'Cause, one minute you told me I'm worthless, and after a few lessons, I'm not?
It's not just me who thinks you're not worthless, Jack.
The way the Princess looks at you..
She believes in you.
- She does?
- Now, go rescue her.
Go!
What's up?
Hmm?
- Jack!
Jack!
- Oh!
You okay?
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah.
You came to save me.
I guess.
I knew you will.
You did?
From the very first.
Princess!
Zhao.
- Are you alright?
- I'm alright.
I'm sorry I came late to save you.
Okay, plan, we did it.
Um...
How do we get out of here?
I'm working on it.
You better work fast, they're coming.
How many?
I...
I don't know. 25?
I need to know exactly how many.
1, 2, 3... 4, 5, 6, 7... 8, 9, 10... 13, 14, 15... 27, 28, 29... 30!
30?

Yeah!
Hurry!
Follow me!
Follow me!

26, 27, 28, 29...

Don't move.
Don't move!
Don't move.
That worked.
Why do you still have this on?
I like it.
Come on.
Get on.
Go.
Are you on?
Are you on?
Get on!
Go.
Come on.
We almost there.
Come on.
Amazing animals.
Raise each and everyone of them from birth.
I've fed them by hand.
Nurse them when they were sick.
They are more loyal than all my men.
They would die for me.
As well the two of you.
And you my dear..
By this time tomorrow, you and I will be husband and wife.
Emperor and empress.
Allow me, my love.
Take them away.
- What are they doing?
- Ancient custom.
Last smoke, last meal..
So you know what you missing.
Damn.
- How can you eat?
- I'm hungry.
- They gonna kill us.
- You should try.
- It's actually pretty good.
- I don't care if it the best food in the world, man.
I'm still a kid.
And my whole life head to me.
There's a million things I'm never gonna be able to do.
Like what?
Dude, I never been kiss a girl.
Me neither.
You know, I was that close before you came to the room.
Yeah.
That's not the point.
- With the Princess?
How close?
- That's not the point.
- What was that?
- A butterfly.
- You spoke to the butterfly?
- Apparently.
- Are they understood you?
- Hopefully.
Long live the king!
Long live the king!
Long live the king!
We are gather at here today to witness the marriage of..
Arun the cruel, the ruin, the horrible, the terrible.
- The strong!
- Can we move it along?
- Hey, I want to say thank you.
- For what?
Try to turn me to be warrior.
You were warrior from the beginning, Jack.
On the inside.
It just had to be brought out.
- Yeah, a lot a good did..
- It's not over yet.
What do you mean this not over yet?
In the minute, she's gonna be marriage and we'll die.
Jack, worrying it's not gonna change anything.
Just live in the moment.
No offense, but I think we don't have a moment.
Do you arun take su lin in sickness and in health..
- For better and the worse?
- I do, she does.
And goes to be my wife.
To make it official, you must now kiss the bridge.

Are you okay?
Hold on.
- Almost there.
- But not quite.
Why you doing this, son?
You're not a warrior.
Not even a grow man.
Leave her alone and I let you live.
- You leave her alone, and I let you live.
- Let me think about it.
No.
I think I'll stay here.
And I will take one leg.
Your other leg.
Now take your arm.
I'll just kill you.
Jack!
Jack!
You're the shit.
Thanks.
Hello, zhao.
The empress request your present.
Okay, I'm just waiting the wizard.
Jack, if the empress summon you, you must come at once.
- He said he'll be right back.
- It is the rule.
Or what, huh?
Get my head chop off?
You guys and your rules, man.
So I guess it's the rules to smile.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Wow.
What?
Sure I'm not gonna have my head chop off?
- There's no one here to see.
- Okay.
I wanted to see you before you went back.
Actually I wish I could go with you.
- Even for one day.
- You are the empress now.
You can do whatever you want.
Because I'm the empress I can't.
Every minutes of everyday from now on will be filled with.
Ministers, ambassadors, and paper to signing, decision to make.
- No dancing.
No singing.
- No fun.
I would love to go to the mall to eat ice cream, but..
I..
I can't.
My father worked so hard to bring peace to the whole country.
I can't let him down.
He gave his life for our people I owe it to him.
I understand.
But I did want to thank you for giving me memories that I will always treasured.
I want to give one that I hope you will, too.
I don't think you're worthless.
I never did.
Goodbye, Jack.
He touched the empress.
He must to die!
Hey..
Hey!
Wizard!
Wizard!
- I'm here.
Got it.
- I gotta go.
No I gotta go now.
I gotta go now.
- Hey, I know.
I put it somewhere.
- I gotta go.
Here you see?
Okay.
- It's not ready yet?
Come on, hurry!
- Relax.
Jack!
So after all we've been through?
- You gotta kill me, really?
- Rules are rules.
If we do not live by them, we'll be nothing more than barbarians.
Unless we can make an exception.
- Sometimes good to be a little flexible, right?
- I hate you.
Here.
Thank you.
Good bye, Jack Bronson.
I will never forget you and the lesson you taught me.
It's done.
The last missing piece to put.
I might learned to be flexible but they haven't.
- Hurry up.
Let's go.
- Yes.
- Come on, man.
Get it in.
- Let's go.
- Go..
Go!
- Come on!
Jack?

6 months, not a house..
Not an apartment.
Hey Mr. Chang says everything happens for a reason..
Yeah, you know what?
Well Mr. Chang is not getting his home foreclosed down in 90 days.
I'm sorry.
I know hes your friend and..
It's really sweet of him to give you a job and everything, but..
We don't need philosophy.
We need a break.

- Oh it's fine.
- No more bully.

Hey!
What are you doing?
You're going to the frat party?
- Where did he go?
- Move gentleman, away!
What's your problem?
- Problem again?
- I'm in trouble still.
You should use some of your movements in your game, Jack.
Kick some butt.
This ain't the gaming world Mr. Chang, this is real world.
One's get nothing to do with the other.
- Bravery is bravery.
- Look at me.
Do I..
Do I even look like I have one awesome brave in me?
Looking and being are 2 different things, young Jack.
On this case..
Here what you see is what you get.
Well, let's see if I can get some work out of my employee.
Yeah okay.
How are thing at home?
Moms worried about money.
Real estate markets dead.
She hasn't sold anything in months.
Looks like we're gonna have to move.
Wish I could do something to help her out.
Medical app or something?
What's all this?
The new shipment from my cousin in Beijing.
Help me open it.
- Mr. Chang what's this?
- It has been in my family since..
Forever.
- You like it?
- Yeah I do.
- The dancing Princess.
- Yeah looks like she's breaking.
- You know, like..
- Oh god..
See look?
I don't think so young Jack.
She lived a long..
Long..
Time ago.
She saved a country from the barbarians.
Talk about brave, she was brave.
This little girl can kick butt big time.
Where do I put it?
- How about your house?
- What do you mean?
I mean..
A present..
- No Mr. Chang..
I can't..
I can't..
- Oh sure you can.
You watch the shop while I going on vacations.
- Oh but you already paying me for that.
- Bad manners to refuse a gift.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- Hey so I have an idea.
- What?
This house..
Really kinda too big for both of us.
I mean when dad was here it was fine.
But now..
You know..
Maybe we should think about renting our room hall.
To that some kid from university or something.
What did I do to deserve a kid like you?
On the lottery?
Night.
- Where is the black knight?
- What?
Hey!
Where is the black knight?
- I..
I'm the black knight.
- You lie!
You die!
Black knight, it's octo man.
- Hey wait, wait.
- I'll challenge you to a duel to death.
It is a video game!
It's a video game!
Okay?
I just..
I just want to show you man.
I'm 8 arms now bro.
Okay you see that's the challenger and that's me, the black knight.
It is true..
Yeah it's me, hey look when I move..
He moves.
Fight!
You are the winner.
Just you wait man, when I'm comeback with 12 arms.
- So you are the black knight.
- In the game world, I'm the black knight.
In this world I'm Jack Bronson.
Jack Bronson worthless to me.
But I don't have a choice.
Jack Bronson, I need your help.
For what?
I need you to guard the most precious treasure of the empire.
Excuse me?
Your majesty, you can go out.
The Princess and future empress.
Hi, I'm Jack.
Anyone who touches the Princess dies.
That is the rule.
No exceptions?
There's no point in having rule if you have exception.
Sometimes is good to be a little flexible.
It's useless.
But I don't have a choice.
I'll be back as soon as possible.
If anything happens to her..
I'm hallucinating, this is crazy, this isn't happening, this isn't happening.
- Where are your-weapons?
- My weapons?
Warrior zhao said you were going to protect me.
To protect me you need to have skills and weapons.
Hey you know, I..
I think warrior zhao a little confuse because..
I'm not the black knight.
I don't have skills or weapons.
So warrior zhao was right, you are worthless.
Okay you know what?
Can we start over?
I'm Jack..
- What do I call you?
- Your highness.
- I need a name.
- Sulin.
- Okay.
- I'm hungry Jack.
Bring be swallow nest soup.
Roasted snail, the big kind.
Oh and duck tongue in hot chilli sauce.
Let's see what I can do.
Not bad.
Su lin?
No, no, no, no.
Hey, just in time.
Hey, how's your sleep?
Great, how did your sleep?
Good.
- Do want to sit down?
- Umm, no, no.
Because I read that it's better for your digestion if you're standing.
I never heard it.
Okay, I'll do the dishes.
No, no, I'll do it mom, I do it mom, I'll do dishes today.
Excuse me, what?
You have to go to work, the bridge's down, this traffic, you can be late.
- The bridge?
- Yeah.
No, you gotta go, you're gonna be late.
- Okay I need my keys..
- Got it, please... ok.
Hey, I am gonna go see aunt Sophie tomorrow, do you wanna come with?
Oh no, I gotta a lot stuff to do, like homework.
Yeah, bye bye.
Okay, you gotta come inside.
Hey, I am not joking.
God!
Ok, stay here, don't move.
Whaddup, man?
!
So, how do you like my octopus, bro?
Lame.
Damn, it's a prototype, yo, just gimme some time.
- I'll be killing it 8 arms and shit.
- Hello.
Hello?
You gonna intro me, bro?
- This is Hector.
- Octoman, yo.
Octoman, this is your highness.
- Really?
That's her name?
- Yeah, that's it.
Well, pound it up, your highness.
No!
Oh dude, I am so sorry.
I am sorry, you ok?
Yeah, it's cool man, I kinda worry, you know.
So what's the story here?
It's complicated, I don't really want talk about it right now.
- You know what I mean.
- Dude, the girl is hot.
- You're gonna hook up?
- No, if you keep ask..
Me stupid questions like that.
You tell me all about that, right?
- Until the last detail.
- Right, catch you two lovebirds later.
You can't do that!
- He want to hit me.
- No, he want to fist bump you!
It's a greeting like a handshake.
Didn't you hear warrior zhao?
No one can touch a Princess, you get your heap chopped off.
- That's the rule.
- Ok, maybe where you come from..
That's the rule, but here, here the rules are different.
When you go back to your world, you can chop off as many heads as you want, I promise.
But here, my world my rule, ok?
Ok.
No!
- What are you doing?
- Observing your world, so I can learn the rules better.
No, no, no, you have to go back inside.
How am I gonna to learn rules of your world if I don't see it?
Well you can go out dressed like that.
- Why not?
- Because..
Because, they will stare and wonder what the hell is going on.
If I were dressed differently could I stand here?
- Yes.
- Then call the tailor and have him..
- Make me new cloth.
- We don't get our clothes from the tailor.
Then take me where you do.
This for man.
- You okay?
- What's that?
- That's ice cream, it's food.
- What that feels like?
Well, it's cold and sweet.
I want one.
Ok what flavor do you want?
They have chocolate, vanilla, strawberry, cherry and mint..
Umm, I want all of them.
All of them?
Ok.
Ok.
- Girl, you're the shit.
- Hey hey, it's your ice cream.
- Yeah, we gotta go.
- That was fun.
- Yeah, really?
- I like them all, Jack, thank you for bringing me here.
You're welcome.
What do you mean I'm the shit?
When you really like something, that's what we say.
Hey mom.
- Hello.
- I ate ice cream.
Yeah, I can see that.
Mom, I forget to tell you.
Yesterday in school they asked someone to volunteer..
To take an exchange student, and...
- Sulin showed up today.
- Oh you fresh out of the boat.
No boat, I came by box.
- What?
- Oh she meant plane.
Plane, because box and plane are the same in her language.
What's the plane?
- She does it all the time.
- I thought she just gotten here.
- She did.
- But you just said all the time.
I did, I meant that in the time she's been here.
- Are you ok with this?
- Yeah, I mean..
- No, no, no.
- Sulin, it's so nice to meet you.
I am Jack's mom, I am Annie.
I am so hungry.
I am sure we have salad, fresh corn and..
Hamburger.
Sulin do you like hamburgers?
I like snails, like Jack and me last night.
Last night?
The Chinese grammar, they get their past and future tenses mixed up a lot.
You know you're acting very weird.
Why don't you put the burgers on?
Su lin and I will go make up the couch and the guess room for her.
I'm gonna be gone tomorrow but maybe when I get back we can get to know each other little better?
Maybe we can go to the mall, it's the shit.
- Who told you that?
- Jack.
Umm, this is where you gonna be sleeping.
- She said that?
- To my mom.
- That is ill dude.
- Hector, give me a break.
I don't know, man, the girl is hot.
Things I would do to her..
Good night Hector.
Excuse me, the bed next door is in the wrong position.
Very bad feng shui, I can't sleep.
This one good feng shui.
Don't forget to clean the house.
Oh don't worry, you won't recognize the place when get back.
- Say hi to aunt Sophie.
- Sure.
- Where is she?
- Who the hell are you?
- Where is the Princess?
- Listen man, I don't know, ok?
I am here.
No, no, no!
Jack!
Jack!
Jack!
Jack!
Jack!
Jack!
Ok, I told you not to let her outta of your sight.
- You worthless!
- I am not a warrior!
I don't know what you're expecting.
I was expecting more.
Ok, well how about this for more, when I saw she was taken by those..
Whatever the hell those I jumped in and after them, man, ok?
What more do you want?
And by the way, we came the same way seconds apart, she should be here.
- She's not.
- Well where is she then?
- I don't know.
- How you could not know?
I was right behind her.
I was busy!
Maybe she came in and ran out.
She probably outside.
Wait, don't!
Oops.
Ok, ok.
I don't want you to think I am backing out on you, but it's not, you know, I got a lot of homework to do..
So I should getting back by now, just go back to where I came.
It's not gonna happen.
So I am stuck here, there's no other way out?
I didn't say that.
- I am not in charge of transportation.
- Well who is?
- The wizard it is.
- And where's the wizard?
Jack Bronson, I won't do that.
- Wake up!
- Stop!
Never wake a sleeping wizard.
What?
I'll get my head chopped off?
Yes, how did you know?
Lucky guess.
What is it with you people chopping off heads?
I mean, really.
It's effective.
Close the door!
Cut the rope!
Get behind me!
Open the door.
There's like thousands of..
Just open it.
Ok.
Sorry.
Hello, what is your name, young man?
- Jack.
- Oh Jack, welcome Jack.
Is something wrong?
No, you just look a lot like someone I know.
Is he handsome?
Yes.
Ok, now let's go find the Princess.
- Can you explain something to me?
- If I can.
- Well let's start with the chest.
- The warrior's gate.
- That's the real name.
- And how does it work?
That's complicated.
It has to do with times, spaces, magic..
And things beyond explaining.
The main thing is that it's works.
- Then how do I get back.
- Another chest.
There's another chest?
Great, where is it?
Well, that is complicated.
I have to collect four different woods..
From 4 different trees that grow in four different parts of the country.
North where zippa wood is found.
South where the spotted bamboo grows.
East where the black mahogany lives.
And west where the rarest tree in all the land is found.
That's the only way to build a new box.
But first let's find the Princess.
You know where she is?
Another complicated question.
How about an easy one, huh?
Zhao.
Tell me about zhao.
That's easy.
Warrior zhao was one of the seven companions..
Raised from birth by the sacred monks..
For one thing and one thing only.
To protect the emperor.
The monks train the 7 companions day and night, year in and year out, until they would be most invincible force.
It was their sole purpose in life to protect the emperor..
While brought peace to the land.
There was not a man alive who could defeat them.
Except one.
Arun the cruel, king of barbarians.
As fate would have it.
Zhao was on the mission and they figure it out.
The food has been poisoned.
Feeling the worse.
He rush to protect the emperor.
But he arrived too late.
And then chaos descended from the north.
And the peace that emperor had work so hard to built began to fall apart.
With no leader the army was lost.
The people were lost.
The zhao fought relentlessly but as great as warrior as he was.
He needed a help of the greatest warrior that could be found.
And so, by using the cynic stone.
I found you.
Yes.
And we pass through the warriors gate to get help protecting the greatest treasure we possessed.
- Shuman?
- Sulin.
The only one who can rally the people to defeat.
The barbarians and save our kingdoms.
But I'm not be able to help him.
He thinks I am worthless.
Oh, you seems might.
But I don't.
- Based on what?
- You're here.
You didn't have to be.

That's something about who you are.
Am I crazy?
And now if you will excuse me.

Force to.
Unless we stop it.
- Ah..
Who is the groom?
- Arun the cruel.
Ah, is it his name?
His full name is arum the cruel, the horrible, the terrible, the miserable.

And once he is an emperor.
He will kill her and the whole country is doom.

Any idea what kind husband she looking for?
Cause in the little time we spend together, you know what?
I thought we have something.
You know, connection.
Cause we like the same clothes, we like the same musics.

- No, I don't think, Jack Bronson.
She's looking for someone good, someone brave, a hero.
Yeah.
Seized in the right of capital of chunghai province.
1.600 bricks of silver, 18.000 bricks of gold. 6 chests of diamonds.
And 26 slaves.
- Only 26 slaves?
- Yes, I know.
We're under performing in that department.
Who is in charge of slaves?
My cousin.
Get rid of him.
Brutus, I mean the cousin.
Not him!
Ups.
A second moment here, big fella.
Now, I know you want to please me, but next time..
Before you kill someone.
Should we have a signal, maybe?
Like, something like that?
Like, signal?
Like that?
A signal like that?
- Like that?
Yes.

That's the signal.
- Yes.

Your highness.

Beautiful bride has arrive.
Hello, my love.

You and me.
Let's move!
You and me!
- Go!

- It's gonna rain.
There's no cloud.
Not all rain come from cloud.
Oh my god!
Oh my god!
Look at this!
What the hell is going on?
He wants me dead.
- So they know we are here?
- They know we're somewhere around here.
So they're just keep shooting arrows everywhere and hope to get lucky.
We called it the morning shower.
Why don't you wake me up?
I could been dead.
If I want you dead, I will do it myself.
You have to learn to listen.
- What is said?
- Do not enter.
- And what's in there?
- The unknown land.
- What is in the unknown land?
- Unknown things.
Okay, wait, but..
You are drop me off to the wizard, right?
- Wrong.
- Okay, look, I really think..
Is about time we thought about getting me home?
- So do I. Here.
- What is this?
A map.
It will take you to the wizard.
I..
I can't read this.
I just want to go home and you are not helping.
- I gave you a map.
- So basically it's screw you, Jack.
I brought you here against your will, I kidnapped you, and now you're not the person I though you were.
So, adios amigo.
You are not my problem.
Wrong at number one.
I did not kidnap you.
No one need you jump into that chest.
Right on number two.
You are not my problem.
My problem is to get through the unknown land.
Get pass the arum's army.
Pass his personal guards.
Pass the terror guards.
Find the Princess, get pass the tower's reinforcement.
Pass the personal guard's reinforcement.
Kill arum.
And then bring the Princess back so she can be made empress who save the country.
That is my problem.
So you're saying I don't have a choice.
You do have a choice.
You can save yourself or you can save her.
- I can't save a Princess!
- You are the black knight.
- Oh, yeah, I almost forgot.
- Sir, sir..
Sir..
Good news.
Don't be nervous.
It's been my lucky days so far.
- And I've good feeling about this one.
- Yes, sire.
I'm sure, it's good news.
Bad news.
- No, impossible..
- No sign of warrior zhao.
Sire... sire..
Brutus..
No, no..
- Signal, you remember, the signal?
- Signal?
- Kill him!
- No, no, no, no!
Sire!
Sire!
I was thinking.
This arum dude, maybe if he gets what he want, he'll change, you know.
Be like arum the kind?
Do you have people in your world who get what they want by threating to do bad things?
At least there is one kid.
And you give him what he wants.
Does he change?
Not really.
Might does not make right, Jack.
Right makes right.
If you don't stand up for what is right, and why you stand up at all?
You know, that's easy to say.
This, this kid, he is bigger then me.
He's stronger then me.
So what do you do?
- I run.
- Is that solve your problem?
No.
- So you got a girl?
- No.
- Because?
- Because I had my job.

Invisible woman.
How is the priest people in place boxes and time travel, and none of us are weird, is it?
It's not weird.

We don't have magic.
Then how you do explain what cannot be explain?
We have sains.
Sains is everything.
- Does sains explain rainbow or snowflakes?
- Yes.
But does it explain how you feel when you see the rainbow or snowflake?

Feeling aren't magic.

- I don't know.
The feeling.
Okay, they make you do and say things you normally wouldn't do or say, like, like..
If you met this girl that you never knew.
And all the sudden there's..
Can't think anything to say but you can't stop talking.
And your body like hot and cold in the same time and...
Your heart is beating like you just run a mile in a minute... and it's..

Get away from him!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Zhao!
Hey, since it seems we're in trouble every 20 minutes...
Maybe it could be good if you showed me a few moves.
Just in case.
Martial arts take many years to learn.
No, I'm not asking for the whole menu.
Just a little something.
Martial arts do notwork with a little something.
Well then, a lot of something.
Anything.
Even if I can do one thing to help out the next time we're in a situation.
Just give me something so I have a fighting chance.
Please.
Come on.
Come on.
Get up.
Stand a feet apart.
Oh, this is cool.
Bend your knees.
Sorry.
Okay.
Now imagine... there's a big tree in front of you.
Do you see it?
Yeah.
Is it big?
Yeah.
Okay.
Now, hug it.
Do what?
I mean hug the tree.
Good.
- That's it?
- That's it.
Well, how long do I have to stay like this?
You know if you're not gonna teach me, you should just say so.
I am teaching you.
Yeah.
Right.
Thanks.
Thanks a lot.
Hey.
Hey, wait.
What are you doing?
Come on.
Now, pay attention.
The secret of all martial arts is the circle.
When you moved, the circle moves with you.
Here, let me show you.
Hit me.
Hit me again.
Again.
To understand the circle, you must make the circle...
Live the circle, now, the circle is you..
And you are the circle.
Understand?
We move the moment she says "I do".
First on me.
Directly for the capital.
Second army.
To the ocean.
And the third army?
We have a third army?
Yes.
Just let them robbing village.
Excuse me, sir.
For the wedding canopy.
Red or blue?
Red or blue, my love?
Oops.
And this is called not good.
Why, it's beautiful?
Yes, it is.
But the fortress is over there.
And it could take days to walk all the way around the lake.
Or we could just swim across in no time.
No, Jack.
It's not possible.
Why, are there man-eating fish in there?
No.
- Poisonous snakes?
- Nope.
- Dragons?
- Not this time of year.
So, what's in it that's a problem?
I cannot swim.
You kidding me?
You... you who can kick the butts of the entire NFL at the same time...
And you can't swim, what's wrong with this picture?
They never taught...
Yeah.
Oh, come on.
Where you're going?
There's no time to waste.
You're gonna walk?
We don't have a choice.
Okay, you gotta get over this "you don't have a choice" thing, alright?
You do have a choice.
You're strong and you're coordinated.
Alright, maybe, we can work something else, okay?
I teach you to swim, you teach me more...
Deal?
Come on.
Ooh...
You can do it.
You can do it, come on.
Trust me.
Hey, that's it.
There you go.
Now, put the shield on.
Now, hop on.
- Ooh...
- Hey.
There you go.
You having fun?
Yeah.
I bet you didn't get too much of that, growing up the way you did.
Fun?
No.
So, if you can make up for that...
Maybe you can come visit me.
I'll show you around, maybe get my mom to take us to Disneyland or something.
I told you.
I can never take off from my job.
Hey, man, look... you... you really got to get a life.
When you're responsible for a life, you don't have a life.
Okay.
You...
You like go to school to learn how say things like that?
Like what?
When you're responsible for a life, you don't have a life.
What's wrong with it?
Nothing is wrong, but that, it's just...
Sound smart.
It does?
Yeah, it does.
Cool.
So, what's in Disneyland?
A lot of princesses.
Oh.
- A Chinese one, too.
- Oh.
- Our king will win!
- Our king will win!
Get down, get down, get down!
So, you... you do have a plan, right?
I've told you the plan.
Ah, right.
Get past the army.
- Yes.
- Get past the personal guards.
- Correct.
- Get past the tower guards.
Find the Princess.
- Get past reinforcements?
- Good.
- Kill arun.
- Exactly.
Crowned sulin in person saved the country.
You learning to listen.
Yeah.
The real questions is...
Do you have a plan to execute...
The plan?
Hmm?
Ah, I mean...
- Who will win?
- Our king will win!
Our king will win!
Good morning.
Hmm?
Great plan.
- Are we in the fortress?
- Yeah.
- Are we passed the army?
- Yeah.
Have we passed the personal guards?
Almost.
Well then, I think the plan is working.
I think the plan to get in is working.
How about the plan to get out?
I'm working on it.
Warrior zhao.
I'm so honored, that you've come all this way to attend my wedding.
I'm not here to attend your wedding.
I'm here to attend your funeral.
And you are?
He's the black knight.
I'm not the black knight, okay?
I'm...
I'm Jack Bronson.
Jack Bronson.
I've got good news.
And I have bad news.
The good news is...
Tomorrow... when my bride and I are married.
We will stand... there.
And you two... will stand...
There.
Okay, what's the bad news?
As soon as we've taken our vows...
You know, new life begins...
Your life ends.
He's not bluffing, is he?
Arun doesn't do bluffs.
Even maybe he'll be feeling generous 'cause it his wedding day, and he'll pardon us.
Arun doesn't do generous.
Okay, if he doesn't do this and he doesn't do that...
Is there anything that he does do?
Well, he rapes, murders, and pillagers.
I guess in another words we're dead.
When one door closes, another one opens.
See?
Dinner is served.
Urgh...
I was not expecting that.
It's time to eat.
Uh... excuse me?
Uh... would you mind...
You know, so we can...
Thank you.
Here.
Guys, I'm..
I'm looking for the Princess.
You know where she is?
What now?
Now is the time to use what I've taught you.
I'm not ready.
Of course, you are.
You're the black knight.
You have skills.
Okay, I don't...
I don't get it.
'Cause, one minute you told me I'm worthless, and after a few lessons, I'm not?
It's not just me who thinks you're not worthless, Jack.
The way the Princess looks at you..
She believes in you.
- She does?
- Now, go rescue her.
Go!
What's up?
Hmm?
- Jack!
Jack!
- Oh!
You okay?
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah.
You came to save me.
I guess.
I knew you will.
You did?
From the very first.
Princess!
Zhao.
- Are you alright?
- I'm alright.
I'm sorry I came late to save you.
Okay, plan, we did it.
Um...
How do we get out of here?
I'm working on it.
You better work fast, they're coming.
How many?

Nurse them when they were sick.
They are more loyal than all my men.
They would die for me.
As well the two of you.
And you my dear..
By this time tomorrow, you and I will be husband and wife.
Emperor and empress.
Allow me, my love.
Take them away.

Dude, I never been kiss a girl.

You know, I was that close before you came to the room.
Yeah.

How close?

- Apparently.
- Are they understood you?
- Hopefully.
Long live the king!
Long live the king!

Not even a grow man.
Leave her alone and I let you live.

No.
I think I'll stay here.
And I will take one leg.
Your other leg.
Now take your arm.

Thanks.
Hello, zhao.
The empress request your present.
Okay, I'm just waiting the wizard.
Jack, if the empress summon you, you must come at once.
- He said he'll be right back.
- It is the rule.
Or what, huh?
Get my head chop off?
You guys and your rules, man.
So I guess it's the rules to smile.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Wow.
What?
Sure I'm not gonna have my head chop off?
- There's no one here to see.
- Okay.
I wanted to see you before you went back.
Actually I wish I could go with you.
- Even for one day.
- You are the empress now.
You can do whatever you want.
Because I'm the empress I can't.
Every minutes of everyday from now on will be filled with.
Ministers, ambassadors, and paper to signing, decision to make.
- No dancing.
No singing.
- No fun.
I would love to go to the mall to eat ice cream, but..
I..
I can't.
My father worked so hard to bring peace to the whole country.
I can't let him down.
He gave his life for our people I owe it to him.
I understand.
But I did want to thank you for giving me memories that I will always treasured.
I want to give one that I hope you will, too.
I don't think you're worthless.
I never did.
Goodbye, Jack.
He touched the empress.
He must to die!
Hey..
Hey!

Here you see?
Okay.
- It's not ready yet?
Come on, hurry!
- Relax.
Jack!
So after all we've been through?
- You gotta kill me, really?
- Rules are rules.
If we do not live by them, we'll be nothing more than barbarians.
Unless we can make an exception.
- Sometimes good to be a little flexible, right?
- I hate you.
Here.
Thank you.
Good bye, Jack Bronson.
I will never forget you and the lesson you taught me.
It's done.
The last missing piece to put.
I might learned to be flexible but they haven't.
- Hurry up.
Let's go.
- Yes.
- Come on, man.
Get it in.
- Let's go.
- Go..
Go!
- Come on!
Jack?

- I've never seen that before.
What, me, operate a computer?
Hey, I don't mean to put pressure on you, sweetie, but you really gotta do great at school.
'Cause, at this point, I...
I just...
I can't afford college.
You gotta get a scholarship.
Is nothing selling?
Six months.
Not a house, not an apartment.
Hey, Mr. Chang says everything happens for a reason.
Yes, you know what?
Well, Mr. Chang is not getting his home foreclosed on in 90 days.
(CHILDREN YELLING DISTANTLY)
I'm sorry.
I know he's your friend, and it's really sweet of him to give you a job and everything, but...
We don't need philosophy.
We need a break.
Hey... how's it going with Travis and them?
Oh, that's fine.
- No more bullying?
- I just told you.
Okay.
- I love you.
- Love you too.
- No more gaming.
- Mm.
- Until you finish your homework.
- Is that a threat?
Yeah.
(TRILLS AND BEEPS)
HECTOR:
I am Octoman!
(LAUGHING MANIACALLY)

Hector, you dork.
- An octopus has eight arms.
- Whatever!
(SCOFFS) Look who's here.
TRAVIS:
Watch this, dork!
- Oh, no, Travis.
- Whoo!
(GRUNTS) Whoo!

You like that?
You like that?
Whoo!
You like that, huh?
Bye-bye.
(BOYS SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY)

TRAVIS:

(GRUNTS)
(PANTING)
BOY:
Hey, Travis, you're all right there?
JACK:
Oh, gosh, I'm really sorry.
How many times I gotta tell you?
This is our spot!
You said the park on Magnolia was your spot.
You didn't... you didn't say anything about this.
Any place there's a ramp, that's ours.
You almost killed me, twerp!
I'm sorry, okay'?
It was an accident!
Accident or not... (BOTH GRUNT)
I'm still gonna kick your butt.
- Ah!

(IZIA'S "SO MUCH TROUBLE" PLAYING)

Let's go!
Gotta move, boys!
Come on!
Let's go, boys!

Go!

Get out of the way, wrinkles!
WOMAN:
Watch it!

Let's go to the left!
Whoa!

Come on, come on!
Hurry up, hurry up!
JACK:
No, no, no, no!
TRAVIS:
Oh, move!
Move, what are you doing?
What, you going to a frat party?
- Move, get out of the way!
- Where'd he go?
What's your problem?
- (BELL RINGS) - (OLD CHANG) Trouble again?
JACK:
You mean trouble still.
(STRAINED) You should use some of those moves from your game, Jack.
(SIGHS) Kick some butt.
That's the gaming world, Mr. Chang.
This is the real world.
One's got nothing to do with the other.
- Bravery is bravery.
- Look at me.
Do I even look like I have one ounce of brave in me?
Looking and being are two different things, young Jack.
Not in this case.
Here, it's what you see is what you get.
Well, let's see if I can get some work out of my employee.
Okay.
How are things at home?
Eh, Mom's worried about money.
The real estate market's dead.
She hasn't sold anything in months.
Looks like we're gonna have to move.
I wish I could do something to help her out, invent a cool app or something.
What's all this?
It's a new shipment from my cousin in Beijing.
Help me open it.
Mr. Chang, what's this?
This has been in my family since forever.
You like it?
Yeah.
I do.
The Dancing Princess.
Yeah, looks like she's breaking.
- You know, like...
- (LAUGHS)
See?
Look.
I don't think so, young Jack.
She lived a long, long time ago.
She saved her country from the Barbarians.
Talk about brave.
She was brave.
This little girl can kick butt, big time.
Where do I put it?
How about your house?
What do you mean?
I mean, a present.
- No, Mr. Chang, I can't.
- Oh, sure you can.
You watch the shop while I go on vacation.
But you're already overpaying me for that.
Bad manners to refuse a gift.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- JACK:
Hey, so I have an idea.
- ANNIE:
Mm.
This house... really kinda too big for the both of us.
I mean, when Dad was here, fine.
But now, you know, maybe we should think about renting a room out, you know, to some kid from the university or something.
What did I do to deserve a kid like you?
Win the lottery?
- Good night.

It's a video game!
Okay?
I just want to show you, man.
I have eight arms now, bro!
(LAUGHS)
Okay, see?
That's the challenger.
And that's me, the Black Knight.

So you are the Black Knight?
In the game world, I'm the Black Knight.
In this world, I'm Jack Bronson.
Jack Bronson is worthless to me.
(SPEAKING MANDARIN)
Jack Bronson, I need your help.
For what?
I need you to guard the most precious treasure of the empire.
Excuse me?
(SPEAKING MANDARIN)
The Princess and future Empress.
Oh...
Hi.
I'm Jack...
Anyone who touches the princess dies!
That is the rule.
No exceptions?
There is no point of having a rule if you have an exception.
Sometimes it's good to be a little flexible.
(SPEAKING MANDARIN)
If anything happens to her...
(STAMMERS) I am hallucinating.
This is crazy.
This isn't happening, this isn't happening.
- Where are your weapons?
- My weapons?
Warrior Zhao said you were going to protect me.
To protect me you need to have skills.
And weapons.
Okay, you know, I think Warrior Zhao is a little confused 'cause...
I'm not the Black Knight.
I don't have skills, or weapons.
So Warrior Zhao was right.
You are worthless.
Okay, you know what, can we start over?
I'm Jack.
- What do I call you?
- Your Highness.
I meant your name.
- Sulin.
- Okay.
I'm hungry, Jack.
Bring me swallow nest soup.
Mm, roasted snail, the big kind.
Oh, and duck tongues in hot chili sauce.
Mm.
I'll see what I can do.

Hey.
Just in time.
Hey, how did you sleep?
Great.
How did you sleep?
(YAWNS) Fine.
Do you want to sit down?
Um... no, no, urn... because I read that it's better for digestion if you stand.
I never heard that.
Um, okay, I'm gonna do the dishes.
No, no, I'll do it, Mom.
Leave it, Mom, I'll do the dishes today.
Excuse me, what?
You have to go to work.
The bridge is down, there's traffic.
- You're gonna be late.
- The bridge?
Yeah, you've gotta go, you're gonna be late.
- ANNIE:
I need my...
- JACK:
Here's the bag, keys, phone...
Hey, I'm going to see aunt Sophie tomorrow.
Do you want to come with?
Uh, no, I've got a lot of stuff to do, like homework.
- Okay.
- Yeah, okay, bye.
(SIGHS)
- Okay, you gotta come inside!
- (EXHALES SHARPLY)
Hey!
I'm not joking!
- (GRUNTS) - (DOORBELL RINGING)
- Okay, just stay here.
Don't move!
- (CONTINUES RINGING)
What up, man?
(GRUNTS)
So how'd you like my octopus, bro?
Mm, lame.
Damn, it's a prototype, yo.
Just gimme some time, I'll be killin' it.
- Eight arms and stuff.
- SULIN:
Hello?
- Hello.
- Whoa.
You gonna intro me, bro?
Uh.
This is Hector.
- Octoman, yo.
- Octoman.
This is...
Her Highness.
Really?
That's her name?
Yeah, that's it.
Well, pound it out, Your Highness. (LAUGHS)
- No!
- (GRUNTS)
- (GROANS)
- Oh, dude, I'm so sorry.
- (GROANS)
- Are you okay?
Yeah, it's cool, man.
- I got seven more, you know.
- (GRUNTS)
So what's the story here?
JACK:
It's complicated, and I don't really want to talk about it right now.
You know what I mean?
Dude, the girl is... whoa!
You gonna hook up?
- (GRUNTS)
- Not if you keep asking stupid questions like that.
- You tell me all about it, though, right?
- Every last detail.
Right, catch you two lovebirds later.
- You can't do that!
- He want to hit me.
No, he went to fistbump you.
It's a greeting, like a handshake.
Didn't you hear Warrior Zhao?
Never touch a princess.
You can get your head chopped off.
That's the rule.
Okay, maybe where you come from, that's the rule.
But here?
Here the rules are different.
When you go back to your world, you can chop off as many heads as you want, I promise.
But here, my world, my rules.
- Okay?
- Okay.
No!
- (SIGHS)
- What are you doing?
Observing your world, so I can learn the rules better.
No, no, no, no, you have to go back inside.
How am I going to learn the rules of your world if I don't see it?
Well, you can't go out dressed like that.
- Why not?
- Because...
Because people will stare and wonder what the heck's going on.
If I was dressed differently could I stand here?
Yes!
Then call the tailor and have him make me new clothes.
Uh, we don't get our clothes from a tailor.
Then take me where you do.
(SAMSAYA'S "STEREOTYPE" PLAYING)
These are men's.
- Hey, hey, hey.

- Are you okay?
- What's that?
That's ice cream.
It's food.
What does it taste like?
Well, first it's cold, then it's sweet.
Mm.
I want one.
Okay, well, what flavor do you want?
They have chocolate, vanilla, strawberry, cherry, mint chip...
Mm, I want all of them.
All of them?
Okay.

We gotta go.

It was.
I like the mall, Jack.
Thank you for bringing me here.
You're welcome.
What did he mean, I'm "the shit?"
Uh, well, when you really like something,
- that's what you say.
- Mm.
(DOOR OPENS)
Hi, Mom.
Uh, hello.
I had ice cream.
- Yeah, I can see that.
- JACK:
Um...
Do you wanna...
Mom, I forgot to tell you.
Um...
The other day in school they asked someone to volunteer to take an exchange student.
And Sulin showed up today.
Uh, you fresh off the boat, huh?
No boat.
I came by box.
- What?
- Uh, she meant plane.
Plane, because box and plane are the same in her language.
- What's the plane?
- (CHUCKLES AWKWARDLY)
- She does this all the time.
- I thought she just got here?
- She did.
- But you just said all the time.
I did.
Um...
I meant that in the time that she's been here.
Are you okay with this?
- Yeah, I mean...
- Uh, no, no, no, no.
Sulin, it is so nice to meet you.
Um, I'm Jack's Mom.
I'm Annie.
Um, I'm so... hungry.
Um, sure, we have salad, and fresh corn and... hamburgers.
Sulin, do you like hamburgers?
I like snails.
Like Jack made me last night.
Last night?
In the Chinese grammar, they get their past and future tenses
- mixed up a lot.
- ANNIE:
Mm.
Um...
You know you're acting very weird.
Why don't you put the burgers on?
Sulin and I will go make up the couch in the guest room for her.
Okay, I'm gonna be gone tomorrow but maybe when I get back, we can, um... get to know each other a little better.
Maybe we can go to the mall.
It's the shit!
(LAUGHS)
- Who told you that?
- Jack.
Okay, this is where you're gonna be sleeping.
(HECTOR OVER COMPUTER) She said that?

Well, how about this for more?
When I saw she was taken by those...
whatever the hell those were,
I jumped right in after her, man, okay?
How much more can you want?
And by the way, we came the same way, seconds apart.
- She should be here.
- She's not.
- Where is she then?
- I don't know.
How can you not know?
I was right behind her.
I was busy.
Well, maybe she came in and ran out.

Just go back to where I came.
It's not going to happen.
So I'm stuck here?
There's no other way out?
I didn't say that.
I'm not in charge of transportation.

And where is the Wizard?

Hello.
What is your name, young man?
Jack.
Oh, Jack.
Welcome, Jack!
Is something wrong?
No, it's just you look a lot like someone I know.
Is he handsome?
Mm?
Mm?
- Yes.
- (CHUCKLES)
Okay, now let's go find the princess.
- JACK:
Can you explain something to me?
- WIZARD:
If I can.
- Well, let's start with the chest.
- The Warrior's Gate.
That's the real name.
- How does it work?
- That's complicated.
Ah, it has to do with time, space, magic and things beyond explaining.
The main thing is that it works.
- Then how do I get back?
- Another chest.
There's another chest?
- Great, where is it?
- (CHUCKLES) Well, that is complicated.
I have to collect four different woods from four different trees that grow in four different parts of the country.
North... where Zebrawood is found.
South, where the spotted bamboo grows.
East, where the black mahogany lives.
And west, where the rarest tree in all the land is found.
That's the only way to build a new box.
But first, let's find the princess.
- You know where she is?
- Oh, another complicated question.
How about an easy one, huh?
- Zhao.
Tell me about Zhao.
- That's easy.
(BABY CRYING)
Warrior Zhao was one of the seven companions raised from birth by the sacred monks for one thing and one thing only:
To protect the Emperor.
The monks trained the seven companions day and night, year in and year out, until they were the most invincible force.
(GRUNTS)
It was their sole purpose in life to protect the Emperor while he brought peace to the land.
There was not a man alive who could defeat them... except one.
Arun The Cruel, King of Barbarians.
As fate would have it,
Zhao was on a mission and late for dinner.
The food had been poisoned.
Fearing the worst, he rushed to protect the Emperor.
But he arrived too late.
(WOMAN SOBBING)
And then, chaos descended from the North.
And the peace the Emperor had worked so hard to build began to fall apart.
With no leader, the army was lost, the people were lost.
Zhao fought relentlessly, but as great a warrior as he was, he needed the help of the greatest warrior that could be found.
And so, by using the Seeing Stone,
- I found you.
- Yes!
And he passed through the Warrior's Gate to get help protecting the greatest treasure we possess.
- Sulin.
- Sulin.
The only one who can rally the people to defeat the Barbarians and save our kingdom.
But I'm not going to be able to help him.
- He thinks I'm worthless.
- Oh, yes, he might, but I don't.
- Based on what?
- You are here.
You didn't have to be.
You could have stayed home.
That says something about who you are.
(LAUGHS SARCASTICALLY) That I'm crazy.
Hmm.
And now if you will excuse me, I have a lot of wood to collect.
See you, bye-bye-
ZHAO:
Come on, let's go!
You know the old saying about blaming the bearer of bad news?
Yes, Your Highness.
- Do you believe it's true?
- I hope not, Your Highness.
Good news. (EXHALES)
I'm getting married!
Bad news.
Warrior Zhao is on his way.
- Kill him.
- (YELLS)
(GRUNTS)
Brutus!
Not him!
Kill Zhao!
Oops.
- JACK:
So I assume you have a plan.
- ZHAO:
I do.
Save the princess.
Prevent her marriage.
Wait, she's getting married?
Forced to.
Unless we stop it.
Uh, who's the groom?
Arun The Cruel.
(SCOFFS) That's his name?
His full name is Arun The Cruel, The Horrible,
The Terrible, The Miserable, but we keep it short.
If the marriage takes place, when she becomes Empress, he becomes Emperor.
And once he's Emperor, he will kill her, and the whole country is doomed.
- Are you finished with dinner?
- I guess.
Now we sleep.
Hey, I know we're roughing it, but do we have any blankets and pillows?
Blankets, no.
Pillow...
Yes.
(SIGHS)
(GRUNTS)
ZHAO:
Good night.
Okay, say we rescue the princess.
Does she have anyone else in mind to marry'?
Not yet.
Any idea what kind of husband she's looking for?
Cause in the little time that we spent together, you know, I...
I felt that we had something, you know?
A connection.
'Cause we like the same clothes, we like the same music.
- You don't... you don't think that...
- No, I don't think, Jack Bronson.
She's looking for someone good, someone brave, a hero.
Yeah.
TREASURER:
Seized in the raid of the capital of Ching Hai province.
1,600 bricks of silver.
1,800 bricks of gold.
Six chests of diamonds and 26 slaves.
- Only 26 slaves?
- Yes, I know.
We're under-performing in that department.
Who's in charge of slaves?
My cousin.
Get rid of him.
(GRUNTS)
Brutus!
I meant the cousin, not him!
Oops...
Let's take a moment here, big fella.
Now, I know you want to please me.
But, next time, before you kill someone, should we have a signal, maybe?
Like something like that?
Like a signal?
Like that, a signal like that.
- Like that?
- Kill him.
- Yes.
Yes.
- Yes.
That signal.
That's the signal.
BARBARIAN:
Your Highness!
(SULIN YELLING)
Finally, my beautiful bride has arrived.
Hello, my love!
How are you?
- Tired from your long trip?
- (GRUNTING)
In need of a hot bath?
A home-cooked meal maybe?
Soon, my love.
Soon.
- (GRUNTING)
- You and me.

You and me.
(YELLING INDISTINCTLY)
Call the tailor for a fitting.
What are you doing?
It's gonna rain.
Mm.
JACK:
There's no clouds.
Not all rain comes from clouds.
Oh.
My God!
Ah!
Oh, my God, it's raining!
The hell is going on?
(GRUNTS)
- He wants me dead.
- So they know we're here?
They know we're somewhere around here, so they just keep shooting arrows everywhere and hope to get lucky.
We call it the morning shower.
Why didn't you wake me up?
I could have been dead.
If I wanted you dead, I'd do it myself.
You have to learn to listen.
- JACK:
What does it say?
- ZHAO: "Do not enter".
What's in there?
The Unknown Lands.
(SIGHS) And what's in the Unknown Lands?
Unknown things.
Okay, wait, but...
You are dropping me off at the Wizard's, right?
- Wrong.
- Okay, look.
I really think it's about time we thought about getting me home.
So do I. Here.
- What's this?
- A map.
It'll take you to the Wizard.
I can't...
I can't read this!
I just want to go home and you're not helping.
I gave you a map.
Okay, so basically it's "get lost, Jack," huh?
"I brought you here against your will.
I kidnapped you!
And now that you are not the person I thought you were, it's 'Adios, amigo, you are not my problem."'
Wrong on number one.
I did not kidnap you.
No one made you jump into that chest.
Right on number two.
You are not my problem.
My problem is to get through the Unknown Lands.
Get past Arun's army, past his personal guard, past the tower guards, find the Princess, get past the tower reinforcements, past the personal guard reinforcements,
- kill Arun...
- Hello.
And then bring the Princess back, so she can be made Empress, and save the country.
That is my problem.
(EXCLAIMS)
(GRUNTS)
(BOTH GRUNT)
So you're saying I don't have a choice.
You do have a choice.
You can save yourself, or you can save her.
I can't save a princess!
You're the Black Knight!
- Oh, yeah, I almost forgot.
- BARBARIAN:
Sire!
Sire!
Sire!
Good news!
Don't be nervous.
It's been my lucky day so far.
I have a good feeling about this one.
I'm glad, Sire.
I'm sure it's good news.
Bad news.
"There is no sign of the Warrior Zhao."
Sire, Sire... (PANTING)
Brutus... (WHIMPERING)
The signal.
Remember the signal?
- The signal?
- Kill him!
(YELLING)
You know, I was thinking.
This Arun dude, maybe if he gets what he wants, he'll change.
You know?
Be like, Arun The Kind?
Do you have people in your world who get what they want by threatening to do bad things?
There's this one kid.
And when you give him what he wants, does he change?
Not really.
"Might" does not make right, Jack.
Right makes right.
If you don't stand up for what is right, then why stand up at all?
That's easy to say.
This kid, he's bigger than me, he's stronger than me.
So what do you do?
I run.
Does that solve your problem?
No.
- JACK:
So You got a girl?
- ZHAO:
No.
- Because?
- Because I have my job.
What, your job doesn't leave time for a personal life?
My job is my life.
That doesn't sound like much fun.
Fun?
Yeah, you know?
Doing things that make you feel good.
- I feel good doing my job.
- (ANIMAL CALLS)
You gotta loosen up, dude.
Come on.
Ever seen this before?
No?
Okay, look.
It's called dancing, okay?
It's like, uh... (BEATBOXING)
No?
Okay, try these on.
Mm-mm.
Just stay still, or I'll poke your eye out.
There you go.
- Magic!
- It's cool.
Okay, I'm gonna lay down a beat and you just move your hips, okay?
(BEATBOXING)
I don't have time for fun.
Man, come on.
(BIRDS CALLING)
Come on, we don't have all day.
Ooh.
(SNIFFS) Wow.
Excuse me, but we have to get through.
And I need to finish cooking my soup.
How long is that going to take?
Hmm.
All night.
We don't...

You do now.
Perhaps if we moved the pot...
Hey, hey, hey!
Respect your elders, boy!
No disrespect, but we have a very important mission and we have to get through.
Well, your very important mission will have to wait!
(ECHOING) To wait... to wait... to wait...

My bride.
I hope you like your new palace.
And in two days' time, you will take your place next to me.
Of course, your throne will be...
- much lower.
- I would rather die.
Whatever makes you happy, my dear.
You want to see me happy, huh?
Just tell me what I need to do, and it will be done.
Well...
Come close.
(SOFTLY) And I will whisper it in your ear.
Tell me, my love, my sweet songbird, what do I need to do to make you happy?
Die.

Invisible women, powder that freezes people in place, boxes that time-travel, and none of this is weird to you, is it?
It's not weird.
It's just magic.
We don't have magic.
Then how do you explain what cannot be explained?
We have science.
Science explains everything.
Does science explain a rainbow or a snowflake?
- Yes.
- But does it explain how you feel when you see the rainbow or the snowflake?
- No.
- So you do have magic.
- Feelings aren't magic.
- What are they then?
I don't know, they're feelings.
Okay?
They make you do and say things you normally wouldn't do or say, like, if you met this girl you never knew, and all of a sudden, there's...
You can't think of anything to say, but you can't stop talking.
And your body is, like, hot and cold at the same time, and your heart is beating like you just ran a mile in a minute,
- and it's... it's like...
- Magic?
Yeah, I guess.

Sorry it took so long, I got lost.
Hey, since we seem to be getting in trouble all the time, maybe it could be good if you showed me a few moves.
Just in case.
Martial arts take many years to learn.
No, I'm not asking for the whole menu.
Just a little something.
Martial arts do not work with a little something.
Well, then, a lot of something.
Anything.
Even if I can do one thing to help out the next time we're in a situation.
Just give me something so I have a fighting chance.
Please.
(SIGHS) Come on.
Come on.
Get up.
Stand feet apart.
Uh, this is cool.
Bend your knees.
Sorry.
Okay.
Now imagine there is a big tree in front of you.
You see it?
- Yeah.
- Is it big?
Yeah.
Okay, now... hug it.
Do what?
I mean, hug the tree.
Good.
- That's it?
- That's it.
Well, how long do I have to stay like this?
(SIGHS)
Mm!
(SIGHS)
You know, if you're not going to teach me, you should just say so.
- I am teaching you.
- Yeah, right.
Thanks.
Thanks a lot.
Hey.
Hey, wait, what are you doing?
Come on.
Now pay attention.
The secret of all martial arts is the circle.
When you move, the circle moves with you.
Here.
Let me show you.
Hit me.
Hit me again.
(EXCLAIMS)
Again.
(GRUNTS)
To understand the circle, you must make the circle.
Live the circle, until the circle is you, and you are the circle.
Understand?
(SOFT GROAN)
(SIGHS)
We move the moment she says "I do."
The first army, directly for the capital.
The second army, to the ocean.
And the third army?
- We have a third army?
- Yes.
Just let them rob and pillage.
TAILOR:
Excuse me, Sire.
For the wedding canopy, red or blue?
Red or blue, my love?
(LAUGHING)
Oops.
ZHAO:
And this is called not good.
Why?
It's beautiful.
Yes, it is, but the fortress is over there, and it could take days to walk all the way around the lake.
Well, we could just swim across in no time.
(SIGHS)
No, Jack, it's not possible.
- Why?
Are there man-eating fish in there?
- No.
- Poisonous snakes?
- No.
- Dragons?
- Not this time of year.
So what's in there that's a problem?
I cannot swim.
You're kidding me?
(CACKLES)
You... you... you, who can kick the butts of the entire NFL at the same time, and you can't swim?
What's wrong with this picture?
- (LAUGHS)
- They never taught... (SIGHS)
- Oh, come on, where are you going?
- There's no time to waste.
- You're gonna walk?
- We don't have a choice.
Okay, you gotta get over this "you don't have a choice" thing, all right?
You do have a choice.
You're strong and you're coordinated.
Maybe we can work something out.
Okay?
I teach you to swim, you teach me more...
- Deal?
- (SIGHS)
Come on.
- Oh!
- You can do it.
You can do it, man, come on.
Trust me.
(SIGHS)
- Hey, that's it.
- (SHIVERING)
There you go.
Now, put the shield down...
And hop on!
(GASPS)
- Hey!
- (SHIVERING)
There you go.
- JACK:
You're having fun?
- ZHAO:
Yeah.
I bet you didn't get too much of that growing up the way you did.
Fun?
No.
Well, when this is all over, you can make up for that.
Maybe you can come visit me.
I'll show you around, maybe get my Mom to take us to Disneyland or something.
I told you, I can never take off from my job.
Hey, man, look, you really got to get a life.
When you are responsible for a life, you don't have a life.
Okay.
Did you... did you, like, go to school to learn how to say things like that?
Like what?
(SIGHS)
(IMITATES ZHAO) "When you are responsible for a life, you don't have a life."
What's wrong with it?
Nothing's wrong with it, it just... sounds smart.
It does?
Yeah.
It does.
(CHUCKLING)
ZHAO:
So what's in Disneyland?
- JACK:
A lot of princesses.
- Oh!
- A Chinese one too.
- Ooh!
(SOLDIERS YELLING IN MANDARIN)
(ZHAO, WHISPERING) Get down, get down, get down!
- So you do have a plan, right?
- I told you the plan.
- Ah, right.
Get past the army.
- Yes.
- Get past the personal guards.
- Correct.
Get past the tower guards, find the princess,
- get past reinforcements.
- Good.
- Kill Arun.
- Exactly.
Crown Sulin Empress and save the country?
You're learning to listen.
Yeah, the real question is, do you have a plan to execute the plan?
- Hmm?
- (JACK STAMMERS)
(SOLDIERS YELLING IN MANDARIN)
(SOLDIERS HUSH)
- Good morning!
- Mm?
Uh...
JACK:
Great plan.
- Are we in the fortress?
- Yeah.
- Are we past the army?
- Yeah.
Have we passed the personal guards?
Almost.
Well, then I think that the plan is working.
I think the plan to get in is working.
How about a plan to get out?
I'm working on it.
Warrior Zhao,
I'm so honored that you've come all this way to attend my wedding.
I'm not here to attend your wedding.
I'm here to attend your funeral.
(CHUCKLING)
- And you are?
- He's the Black Knight.
(STAMMERING) I'm not the Black Knight, okay?
I'm Jack Bronson.
Jack Bronson...
I've got good news.
And I've got bad news.
The good news is, tomorrow, when my bride and I are married, we will stand, there.
And you two, will stand... there.
Okay.
What's the bad news?
As soon as we take our vows, and our new life begins...
(TRAP DOOR OPENING)
Your life ends.
- He's not bluffing, is he?
- Arun doesn't do bluffs.
Maybe he'll be feeling generous on his wedding day and he'll pardon us.
Arun doesn't do generous.
Okay.
If he doesn't do this and he doesn't do that, is there anything that he does do?
- He murders and pillages.
- So in other words, we're dead.
When one door closes, another one opens.

You're the Black Knight.
You have skills.
Okay.
I don't...
I don't get it.
'Cause one minute you're telling me I'm worthless and after a few lessons, I'm not?
It's not just me who thinks you are not worthless, Jack.
The way the princess looks at you?

It's not over yet.
What do you mean, it's not over yet?
In a minute, she's gonna be married, and we're gonna be hanged.
Jack, worrying is not gonna change anything.
Just live in the moment.
No offense, but I think we've run out of moments.
Do you, Arun, take Sulin, in sickness and in health,

- [yells] - [announcer] You are the winner!
Oh!
He shoots, he scores.
Come on!
Black Knight strikes again!
- [whoops] - [music playing]
[Annie] Jack?
- [trills] - [music stops] [sighs]
When is this gonna get cleaned up?
Mm.
You know, people are coming to see the house.
I'm doing homework.
- Homework?
- Yeah, homework.
You think I'm clueless?
No, I'm working on that.
- Homework...
- I've never seen that before.
What, me, operate a computer?
Hey, I don't mean to put pressure on you, sweetie, but you really gotta do great at school.
'Cause, at this point, I...
I just...
I can't afford college.
You gotta get a scholarship.
Is nothing selling?
Six months.
Not a house, not an apartment.
Hey, Mr. Chang says everything happens for a reason.
Yes, you know what?
Well, Mr. Chang is not getting his home foreclosed on in 90 days.
[children yelling distantly]
I'm sorry.
I know he's your friend, and it's really sweet of him to give you a job and everything, but...
We don't need philosophy.
We need a break.
Hey... how's it going with Travis and them?
Oh, that's fine.
- No more bullying?
- I just told you.
Okay.
- I love you.
- Love you too.
- No more gaming.
- Mm.
- Until you finish your homework.
- Is that a threat?
Yeah.
[trills and beeps]
[Hector] lam Octoman!
[laughing maniacally] [laughs]
Hector, you dork.
- An octopus has eight arms.
- Whatever!
II
[scoffs] Look who's here.
[Travis] Watch this, dork!
- Oh, no, Travis.
- Whoo!
[grunts] Whoo!
- [grunts] - [Travis] You like that?
You like that?
Whom!
You like that, huh?
Bye-bye.
[boys shouting indistinctly] [boys laughing]
[Travis] Get out of the way!
[grunts] [panting] [boy] Hey, Travis, you're all right there?
[Jack] Oh, gosh, I'm really sorry.
How many times I gotta tell you?
This is our spot!
You said the park on Magnolia was your spot.
You didn't... you didn't say anything about this.
Any place there's a ramp, that's ours.
You almost killed me, twerp!
I'm sorry, okay'?
It was an accident!
Accident or not... [both grunt]
I'm still gonna kick your butt.
Ah!
[Panting] [lzia's "So Much Trouble" playing]
You're not getting away that easy!
What are you waiting for?
Let's go!
Gotta move, boys!
Come on!
Let's go, boys!
Let's go, boys!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Get out of the way, wrinkles!
[woman] Watch it!
[kid] Let's go to the left!
Whoa!
[Travis] Car, car, car, car!
[groans]
Look out!
SorFY, ma'am!
Okay.
No, no, no!
Argh!
- [yells] - [horn blares] [boys whooping]
[Travis] Come on, come on!
Hurry up, hurry up!
[Jack] No, no, no, no!
[Travis] Oh, move!
Move, what are you doing?
What, you going to a frat party?
- Move, get out of the way!
- Where'd he go?
What's your problem?
- [bell rings] - [Old Chang] Trouble again?
[Jack] You mean trouble still.
[strained] You should use some of those moves from your game, Jack.
[sighs] Kick some butt.
That's the gaming world, Mr. Chang.
This is the real world.
One's got nothing to do with the other.
- Bravery is bravery.
- Look at me.
Do I even look like I have one ounce of brave in me?
Looking and being are two different things, young Jack.
Not in this case.
Here, it's what you see is what you get.
Well, let's see if I can get some work out of my employee.
Okay.
How are things at home?
Eh, Mom's worried about money.
The real estate market's dead.
She hasn't sold anything in months.
Looks like we're gonna have to move.
I wish I could do something to help her out, invent a cool app or something.
What's all this?
It's a new shipment from my cousin in Beijing.
Help me open it.
II.
Mr. Chang, what's this?
This has been in my family since forever.
You like it?
Yeah.
I do.
The Dancing Princess.
Yeah, looks like she's breaking.
- You know, like...
- [laughs]
See?
Look.
I don't think so, young Jack.
She lived a long, long time ago.
She saved her country from the Barbarians.
Talk about brave.
She was brave.
This little girl can kick butt, big time.
Where do I put it?
How about your house?
What do you mean?
I mean, a present.
- No, Mr. Chang, I can't.
- Oh, sure you can.
You watch the shop while I go on vacation.
But you're already overpaying me for that.
Bad manners to refuse a gift.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- [Jack] Hey, so I have an idea.
- [Annie] Mm.
This house... really kinda too big for the both of us.
I mean, when Dad was here, fine.
But now, you know, maybe we should think about renting a room out, you know, to some kid from the university or something.
What did I do to deserve a kid like you?
Win the lottery?
- Good night.
- [chuckles]
II
[gasps] [speaking Mandarin]
What?
[vibrates] [exclaims]
Where is the Black Knight?
I'm the Black Knight!
You lie, you die!
[Yells]
Black Knight!
It's Octoman!
[laughs maniacally]
- Hey, wait, wait!
- I challenge you to a duel to the death!
[Hector exclaims]
It's a video game!
It's a video game!
Okay?
I just want to show you, man.
I have eight arms now, bro!
[laughs]
Okay, see?
That's the challenger.
And that's me, the Black Knight.
[speaks Mandarin]
Yeah.
It's me.
Look, when I move...
- [grunts] - he moves.
[announcer] Fight!
[video game characters grunting] [game music playing]
[announcer] You are the winner!
[Hector] Just you wait man, I'm gonna come back with twelve arms.
[exclaims]
So you are the Black Knight?
In the game world, I'm the Black Knight.
In this world, I'm Jack Bronson.
Jack Bronson is worthless to me.
[speaking Mandarin]
Jack Bronson, I need your help.
For what?
I need you to guard the most precious treasure of the empire.
Excuse me?
[speaking Mandarin]
The Princess and future Empress.
Oh...
Hi.
I'm Jack...
Anyone who touches the princess dies!
That is the rule.
No exceptions?
There is no point of having a rule if you have an exception.
Sometimes it's good to be a little flexible.
[speaking Mandarin]
If anything happens to her...
II
[stammers] I am hallucinating.
This is crazy.
This isn't happening, this isn't happening.
- Where are your weapons?
- My weapons?
Warrior Zhao said you were going to protect me.
To protect me you need to have skills.
And weapons.
Okay, you know, I think Warrior Zhao is a little confused 'cause...
I'm not the Black Knight.
I don't have skills, or weapons.
So Warrior Zhao was right.
You are worthless.
Okay, you know what, can we start over?
I'm Jack.
- What do I call you?
- Your Highness.
I meant your name.
- Sulin.
- Okay.
I'm hungry, Jack.
Bring me swallow nest soup.
Mm, roasted snail, the big kind.
Oh, and duck tongues in hot chili sauce.
Mm.
I'll see what I can do.
[Shirley Bassey's "Kiss Me Honey, Honey Kiss Me" playing]
[dance music playing over headphones]
[clatters]
Not bad.
II
[breathing deeply]
[sighs]
Oh, no!
Oh!
Oh, no!
Sulin?
[breathing sharply]
No, no, no, no.
[Annie] Hey.
Just in time.
Hey, how did you sleep?
Great.
How did you sleep?
[yawns] Fine.
Do you want to sit down?
Um... no, no, urn... because I read that it's better for digestion if you stand.
I never heard that.
Um, okay, I'm gonna do the dishes.
No, no, I'll do it, Mom.
Leave it, Mom, I'll do the dishes today.
Excuse me, what?
You have to go to work.
The bridge is down, there's traffic.
- You're gonna be late.
- The bridge?
Yeah, you've gotta go, you're gonna be late.
- [Annie] I need my...
- [Jack] Here's the bag, keys, phone...
Hey, I'm going to see aunt Sophie tomorrow.
Do you want to come with?
Uh, no, I've got a lot of stuff to do, like homework.
- Okay.
- Yeah, okay, bye.
[sighs]
- Okay, you gotta come inside!
- [exhales sharply]
Hey!
I'm not joking!
- [grunts] - [doorbell ringing]
- Okay, just stay here.
Don't move!
- [continues ringing]
What up, man?
[grunts]
So h0w'd you like my octopus, bro?
Mm, lame.
Damn, it's a prototype, yo.
Just gimme some time, I'll be killin' it.
- Eight arms and stuff.
- [Sulin] Hello?
- Hello.
- Whoa.
You gonna intro me, bro?
Uh.
This is Hector.
- Octoman, yo.
- Octoman.
This is...
Her Highness.
Really?
That's her name?
Yeah, that's it.
Well, pound it out, Your Highness. [Laughs]
* No!
' [Grunts]
- [groans]
- Oh, dude, I'm so sorry.
' [groans] ' Are YOU okay?
Yeah, it's cool, man.
- I got seven more, you know.
- [grunts]
So what's the story here?
[Jack] It's complicated, and I don't really want to talk about it right now.
You know what I mean?
Dude, the girl is... whoa!
You gonna hook up?
- [grunts]
- Not if you keep asking stupid questions like that.
- You tell me all about it, though, right?
- Every last detail.
Right, catch you two lovebirds later.
- You can't do that!
- He want to hit me.
No, he went to fistbump you.
It's a greeting, like a handshake.
Didn't you hear Warrior Zhao?
Never touch a princess.
You can get your head chopped off.
That's the rule.
Okay, maybe where you come from, that's the rule.
But here?
Here the rules are different.
When you go back to your world, you can chop off as many heads as you want, I promise.
But here, my world, my rules.
"Okay?" Okay,
No!
- [sighs]
- What are you doing?
Observing your world, so I can learn the rules better.
No, no, no, no, you have to go back inside.
How am I going to learn the rules of your world if I don't see it?
Well, you can't go out dressed like that.
- Why not?
- Because...
Because people will stare and wonder what the heck's going on.
If I was dressed differently could I stand here?
Yes!
Then call the tailor and have him make me new clothes.
Uh, we don't get our clothes from a tailor.
Then take me where you do.
[Samsaya's "Stereotype" playing]
These are men's.
- Hey, hey, hey.
- [clatters]
II.
- Are you okay?
- What's that?
That's ice cream.
It's food.
What does it taste like?
Well, first it's cold, then it's sweet.
Mm.
I want one.
Okay, well, what flavor do you want?
They have chocolate, vanilla, strawberry, cherry, mint chip...
Mm, I want all of them.
All of them?
Okay.
[ice cream pouring]
Okay.
- [rhythmic clapping] - [dance music playing]
[all cheering]
- Girl, you the shit.
- Hey, hey, hey.
Here's your ice cream.
We gotta go.
- That was fun!
- Yeah.
It was.
I like the mall, Jack.
Thank you for bringing me here.
You're welcome.
What did he mean, I'm "the shit?"
Uh, well, when you really like something,
- that's what you say.
- Mm.
[door opens]
Hi, Mom.
Uh, hello.
I had ice cream.
- Yeah, I can see that.
- [Jack] Um...
Do you wanna...
Mom, I forgot to tell you.
Um...
The other day in school they asked someone to volunteer to take an exchange student.
And Sulin showed up today.
Uh, you fresh off the boat, huh?
No boat.
I came by box.
- What?
- Uh, she meant plane.
Plane, because box and plane are the same in her language.
- What's the plane?
- [chuckles awkwardly]
- She does this all the time.
- I thought she just got here?
- She did.
- But you just said all the time.
I did.
Um...
I meant that in the time that she's been here.
Are you okay with this?
- Yeah, I mean...
- Uh, no, no, no, no.
Sulin, it is so nice to meet you.
Um, I'm Jack's Mom.
I'm Annie.
Um, I'm so... hungry.
Um, sure, we have salad, and fresh corn and... hamburgers.
Sulin, do you like hamburgers?
I like snails.
Like Jack made me last night.
Last night?
In the Chinese grammar, they get their past and future tenses
- mixed up a lot.
- [Annie] Mm.
Um...
You know you're acting very weird.
Why don't you put the burgers on?
Sulin and I will go make up the couch in the guest room for her.
Okay, I'm gonna be gone tomorrow but maybe when I get back, we can, um... get to know each other a little better.
Maybe we can go to the mall.
It's the shit!
[laughs]
- Who told you that?
- Jack.
Okay, this is where you're gonna be sleeping.
Hector over compute" She said that?
To my Mom.
That is ill, dude.
Hector, gimme a break.
I don't know, man, the girl is hot, yo.
- Good night, Hector.
- [computer trills] [knock on door]
[Sulin] Excuse me...
The bed next door...
it's in the wrong position.
Very bad feng shui.
I can't sleep.
Huh.
Hmm.
This one is good feng shui.
II.
Ooh!
Don't forget to clean the house.
Oh, don't worry.
You won't recognize the place when you get back.
- Yeah?
Sure.
- Say hey to Aunt Sophie.
[car beeps]
[yells]
Where is she?
Who the hell are you?
- Where is the princess?
- Look, man, I don't know, okay?
[Sulin] I'm here.
[man grunts]
[grunting]
[Sulin grunts] [all grunting]
Whoa!
[yells] [grunts]
[Barbarian grunts]
[sighs] [grunting]
- [exclaiming]
- Stay back!
[all grunting]
[both grunting]
[yells] [groans]
[snarls] [grunts]
[both grunt] [all yelling and grunting]
[sighing]
Oh, no, no, no!
[both grunting] [yells]
[gasping]
[Sulin groans] [gasping continues]
[coughing]
[Sulin] Jack!
Please help me!
Help!
[Sulin screams]
Jack!
[Barbarians speaking in Mandarin]
Jack!
Jack!
Jack!
[Whimpers] Jack!
Jack!
- [yelling]
- Jack!
Jack!
[Sulin's screams echoing]
Jack!
Jack!
Jack!
Jack!
Come on!
Help!
Help!
Jack!
[screaming] [grunts]
[groaning] [grunting] Okay.
I told you not to let her out of your sight!
You are worthless!
I'm not a warrior!
I don't know what you were expecting!
I was expecting more.
Okay.
Well, how about this for more?
When I saw she was taken by those...
whatever the hell those were, ljumped right in after her, man, okay?
How much more can you want?
And by the way, we came the same way, seconds apart.
- She should be here.
- She's not.
- Where is she then?
- I don't know.
How can you not know?
I was right behind her.
I was busy.
Well, maybe she came in and ran out.
- She's probably right outside.
- Wait, don't!
[all yelling]
Oops.
[yells] [exclaims]
[grunts]
Okay.
Okay.
I don't want you to think I'm ducking out on you, 'cause I'm not, but, you know, I got a lot of homework to do and I should be getting back by now.
Just go back to where I came.
It's not going to happen.
So I'm stuck here?
There's no other way out?
I didn't say that.
I'm not in charge of transportation.
- Well, who is?
- The Wizard is.
And where is the Wizard?
[Barbarians shouting indistinctly] [man snoring]
[Zha0, softly] Jack Bronson!
I wouldn't do that.
Wake up!
Stop!
Never wake a sleeping Wizard.
Why?
I'll get my head chopped off?
Yes, how did you know?
Lucky guess.
What is it with you people and chopping off heads?
I mean, really.
It's effective.
[Barbarians yelling]
[Zhao grunting] [yelling indistinctly] [all grunting]
Close the door!
Cut the rope!
Hmm.
Mm.
Hmm.
- [grunting continues]
- Get behind me!
[continues grunting]
- [yells] - [screams] [grunts]
Open the door!
There's like thousands of...
Just open it.
Okay... [both exclaim] [coughing] Oh, sorry.
[sighs and laughs]
Hello.
What is your name, young man?
Jack.
Oh, Jack.
Welcome, Jack!
Is something wrong?
No, it's just you look a lot like someone I know.
Is he handsome?
Mm?
Mm?
- Yes.
- [chuckles]
Okay, now let's go find the princess.
- [Jack] Can you explain something to me?
- [Wizard] If I can.
- Well, let's start with the chest.
- The Warrior's Gate.
That's the real name.
- How does it work?
- That's complicated.
Ah, it has to do with time, space, magic and things beyond explaining.
The main thing is that it works.
- Then how do I get back?
- Another chest.
There's another chest?
- Great, where is it?
- [chuckles] Well, that is complicated.
I have to collect four different woods from four different trees that grow in four different parts of the country.
North... where zebrawood is found.
South, where the spotted bamboo grows.
East, where the black mahogany lives.
And west, where the rarest tree in all the land is found.
That's the only way to build a new box.
But first, let's find the princess.
- You know where she is?
- Oh, another complicated question.
How about an easy one, huh?
- Zhao.
Tell me about Zhao.
- That's easy.
[baby crying]
Warrior Zhao was one of the seven companions raised from birth by the sacred monks for one thing and one thing only:
To protect the Emperor.
The monks trained the seven companions day and night, year in and year out, until they were the most invincible force.
[grunts]
It was their sole purpose in life to protect the Emperor while he brought peace to the land.
There was not a man alive who could defeat them... except one.
Arun The Cruel, King of Barbarians.
As fate would have it,
Zhao was on a mission and late for dinner.
The food had been poisoned.
Fearing the worst, he rushed to protect the Emperor.
But he arrived too late.
[woman sobbing]
And then, chaos descended from the North.
And the peace the Emperor had worked so hard to build began to fall apart.
With no leader, the army was lost, the people were lost.
Zhao fought relentlessly, but as great a warrior as he was, he needed the help of the greatest warrior that could be found.
And so, by using the Seeing Stone,
- I found you.
- Yes!
And he passed through the Warrior's Gate to get help protecting the greatest treasure we possess.
- Sulin.
- Sulin.
The only one who can rally the people to defeat the Barbarians and save our kingdom.
But I'm not going to be able to help him.
- He thinks I'm worthless.
- Oh, yes, he might, but I don't.
- Based on what?
- You are here.
You didn't have to be.
You could have stayed home.
That says something about who you are.
[laughs sarcastically] That I'm crazy.
Hmm.
And now if you will excuse me, I have a lot of wood to collect.
See you, bye-bye-
[Zhao] Come on, let's go!
II.
You know the old saying about blaming the bearer of bad news?
Yes, Your Highness.
- Do you believe it's true?
- I hope not, Your Highness.
Good news. [Exhales]
I'm getting married!
Bad news.
Warrior Zhao is on his way.
- Kill him.
- [yells] [grunts]
Brutus!
Not him!
Kill Zha0!
Oops.
- [Jack] So I assume you have a plan.
- [Zhao] I do.
Save the princess.
Prevent her marriage.
Wait, she's getting married?
Forced to.
Unless we stop it.
Uh, who's the groom?
Arun The Cruel.
[scoffs] That's his name?
His full name is Arun The Cruel, The Horrible,
The Terrible, The Miserable, but we keep it short.
If the marriage takes place, when she becomes Empress, he becomes Emperor.
And once he's Emperor, he will kill her, and the whole country is doomed.
- Are you finished with dinner?
- I guess.
Now we sleep.
Hey, I know we're roughing it, but do we have any blankets and pillows?
Blankets, no.
Pillow...
Yes.
[sighs]
II [grunts]
[Zhao] Good night.
Okay, say we rescue the princess.
Does she have anyone else in mind to marry'?
Not yet.
Any idea what kind of husband she's looking for?
Cause in the little time that we spent together, you know, I...
I felt that we had something, you know?
A connection.
'Cause we like the same clothes, we like the same music.
- You don't... you don't think that...
- No, I don't think, Jack Bronson.
She's looking for someone good, someone brave, a hero.
Yeah.
[Treasurer] Seized in the raid of the capital of Ching Hai province.
1,600 bricks of silver.
1,800 bricks of gold.
Six chests of diamonds and 26 slaves.
- Only 26 slaves?
- Yes, I know.
We're underperforming in that department.
Who's in charge of slaves?
My cousin.
Get rid of him.
[grunts]
Brutus!
I meant the cousin, not him!
Oops...
Let's take a moment here, big fella.
Now, I know you want to please me.
But, next time, before you kill someone, should we have a signal, maybe?
Like something like that?
Like a signal?
Like that, a signal like that.
- Like that?
- Kill him.
- Yes.
Yes.
- Yes.
That signal.
That's the signal.
[Barbarian] Your Highness!
[Sulin yelling]
Finally, my beautiful bride has arrived.
Hello, my love!
How are you?
- Tired from your long trip?
- [grunting]
In need of a hot bath?
A home-cooked meal maybe?
Soon, my love.
Soon.
- [grunting]
- You and me.
[chuckling] ' [muffled yelling]
You and me.
[yelling indistinctly]
Call the tailor for a fitting.
II.
What are you doing?
It's gonna rain.
Mm.
[Jack] There's no clouds.
Not all rain comes from clouds.
Oh.
My God!
Ah!
Oh, my God, it's raining!
The hell is going on?
[grunts]
- He wants me dead.
- So they know we're here?
They know we're somewhere around here, so they just keep shooting arrows everywhere and hope to get lucky.
We call it the morning shower.
Why didn't you wake me up?
I could have been dead.
If I wanted you dead, I'd do it myself.
You have to learn to listen.
- [Jack] What does it say?
- [Zhao] "Do not enter".
What's in there?
The Unknown Lands.
[sighs] And what's in the Unknown Lands?
Unknown things.
Okay, wait, but...
You are dropping me off at the Wizard's, right?
- Wrong.
- Okay, look.
I really think it's about time we thought about getting me home.
So do I. Here.
- What's this?
- A map.
It'll take you to the Wizard.
I can't...
I can't read this!
I just want to go home and you're not helping.
I gave you a map.
Okay, so basically it's "get lost, Jack," huh?
"I brought you here against your will.
I kidnapped you!"
And now that you are not the person I thought you were, it's 'Adiés, amigo, you are not my problem."'
Wrong on number one.
I did not kidnap you.
No one made you jump into that chest.
Right on number two.
You are not my problem.
My problem is to get through the Unknown Lands.
Get past Arun's army, past his personal guard, past the tower guards, find the Princess, get past the tower reinforcements, past the personal guard reinforcements,
- kill Arun...
- Hello.
And then bring the Princess back, so she can be made Empress, and save the country.
That is my problem.
[exclaims] [grunts] [both grunt]
So you're saying I don't have a choice.
You do have a choice.
You can save yourself, or you can save her.
I can't save a princess!
You're the Black Knight!
- Oh, yeah, I almost forgot.
- [Barbarian] Sire!
Sire!
Sire!
Good news!
Don't be nervous.
It's been my lucky day so far.
I have a good feeling about this one.
I'm glad, Sire.
I'm sure it's good news.
Bad news.
"There is no sign of the Warrior Zhao."
Sire, Sire... [panting]
Brutus... [whimpering]
The signal.
Remember the signal?
- The signal?
- Kill him!
[yelling]
You know, I was thinking.
This Arun dude, maybe if he gets what he wants, he'll change.
You know?
Be like, Arun The Kind?
Do you have people in your world who get what they want by threatening to do bad things?
There's this one kid.
And when you give him what he wants, does he change?
Not really.
"Might" does not make right, Jack.
Right makes right.
If you don't stand up for what is right, then why stand up at all?
That's easy to say.
This kid, he's bigger than me, he's stronger than me.
So what do you do?
I run.
Does that solve your problem?
No.
II
- [' Hawk] 3° You got a girl?
- [Zhao] No.
- Because?
- Because I have my job.
What, your job doesn't leave time for a personal life?
My job is my life.
That doesn't sound like much fun.
Fun?
Yeah, you know?
Doing things that make you feel good.
- I feel good doing my job.
- [animal calls]
You gotta loosen up, dude.
Come on.
Ever seen this before?
No?
Okay, look.
It's called dancing, okay?
It's like, uh... [beatboxing]
No?
Okay, try these on.
Mm-mm.
Just stay still, or I'll poke your eye out.
There you go.
- Magic!
- It's cool.
Okay, I'm gonna lay down a beat and you just move your hips, okay?
[beatboxing]
I don't have time for fun.
Man, come on.
[birds calling]
Come on, we don't have all day.
Ooh.
[sniffs] Wow.
Excuse me, but we have to get through.
And I need to finish cooking my soup.
How long is that going to take?
Hmm.
All night.
We don't...
we don't have all night.
You do now.
Perhaps if we moved the pot...
Hey, hey, hey!
Respect your elders, boy!
No disrespect, but we have a very important mission and we have to get through.
Well, your very important mission will have to wait!
[echoing] To wait... to wait... to wait...
For my potatoes to soften.
I'm sorry.
- It can't.
- No!
[both grunting]
[Mountain Spirit laughing]
[Mountain Spirit] Over here!
[grunts]
[Mountain Spirit laughs]
Here!
[Laughing] [both grunting]
[grunts]
Whoa!
[yells]
Help me up!
Now!
[Straining]
Come on, Jack.
Come on.
[both grunting]
I did not sign up for this!
[yells] [both grunting]
[grunting continues]
- [knife clangs] - [grunts] [chuckles and grunts] [both grunting]
[straining]
- [yells] - [gasps and screams] [screaming]
Not fire!
[Continues screaming]
I hate fire!
[screaming]
Maybe not so worthless after all.
- You're welcome.
- [grunting]
[Jack panting]
[Sulin grunting]
[Arun] My bride.
I hope you like your new palace.
And in two days' time, you will take your place next to me.
Of course, your throne will be...
- much lower.
- I would rather die.
Whatever makes you happy, my dear.
You want to see me happy, huh?
Just tell me what I need to do, and it will be done.
Well...
Come close.
[softly] And I will whisper it in your ear.
Tell me, my love, my sweet songbird, what do I need to do to make you happy?
Die.
' [grunts] - [men yelling]
As much as I'd like to make you happy, me dying is not on the agenda.
However, if you insist on someone dying, it can be arranged.
[grunts]
Take her away!
[Spits]
- [man shouting] - [Sulin grunting]
Your dinner.
- [laughs] - [rat squeaking] [grunts]
Get out!
II
[Jack] Invisible women, powder that freezes people in place, boxes that time-travel, and none of this is weird to you, is it?
It's not weird.
It's just magic.
We don't have magic.
Then how do you explain what cannot be explained?
We have science.
Science explains everything.
Does science explain a rainbow or a snowflake?
- Yes.
- But does it explain how you feel when you see the rainbow or the snowflake?
- No.
- So you do have magic.
- Feelings aren't magic.
- What are they then?
I don't know, they're feelings.
Okay?
They make you do and say things you normally wouldn't do or say, like, if you met this girl you never knew, and all of a sudden, there's...
You can't think of anything to say, but you can't stop talking.
And your body is, like, hot and cold at the same time, and your heart is beating like you just ran a mile in a minute,
- and it's... it's like...
- Magic?
Yeah, I guess.

[birds chirping]
[birds warbling]
[clears throat] [warbling continues]
[clears throat]
- Zhao, I've got the wood!
- [clears throat]
Sorry it took so long, I got lost.
Hey, since we seem to be getting in trouble all the time, maybe it could be good if you showed me a few moves.
Just in case.
Martial arts take many years to learn.
No, I'm not asking for the whole menu.
Just a little something.
Martial arts do not work with a little something.
Well, then, a lot of something.
Anything.
Even if I can do one thing to help out the next time we're in a situation.
Just give me something so I have a fighting chance.
Please.
[sighs] Come on.
Come on.
Get up.
Stand feet apart.
Uh, this is cool.
Bend your knees.
Sorry.
Okay.
Now imagine there is a big tree in front of you.
You see it?
- Yeah.
- Is it big?
Yeah.
Okay, now... hug it.
Do what?
I mean, hug the tree.
Good.
- That's it?
- That's it.
Well, how long do I have to stay like this?
[sighs]
Mm!
[sighs]
You know, if you're not going to teach me, you should just say so.
- I am teaching you.
- Yeah, right.
Thanks.
Thanks a lot.
Hey.
Hey, wait, what are you doing?
Come on.
Now pay attention.
The secret of all martial arts is the circle.
When you move, the circle moves with you.
Here.
Let me show you.
Hit me.
Hit me again.
[exclaims]
Again.
[grunts]
To understand the circle, you must make the circle.
Live the circle, until the circle is you, and you are the circle.
Understand?
[soft groan]
[sighs]
We move the moment she says "I do."
The first army, directly for the capital.
The second army, to the ocean.
And the third army?
- We have a third army?
- Yes.
Just let them rob and pillage.
[tailor] Excuse me, Sire.
For the wedding canopy, red or blue?
Red or blue, my love?
[laughing]
Oops.
[Zhao] And this is called not good.
Why?
It's beautiful.
Yes, it is, but the fortress is over there, and it could take days to walk all the way around the lake.
Well, we could just swim across in no time.
[sighs]
No, Jack, it's not possible.
- Why?
Are there man-eating fish in there?
- No.
- Poisonous snakes?
- No.
- Dragons?
- Not this time of year.
So what's in there that's a problem?
I cannot swim.
You're kidding me?
[cackles]
You... you... you, who can kick the butts of the entire NFL at the same time, and you can't swim?
What's wrong with this picture?
- [laughs]
- They never taught... [sighs]
- Oh, come on, where are you going?
- There's no time to waste.
- You're gonna walk?
- We don't have a choice.
Okay, you gotta get over this "you don't have a choice" thing, all right?
You do have a choice.
You're strong and you're coordinated.
Maybe we can work something out.
Okay?
I teach you to swim, you teach me more...
- Deal?
- [sighs]
Come on.
- Oh!
- You can do it.
You can do it, man, come on.
Trust me.
[sighs]
- Hey, that's it.
- [shivering]
There you go.
Now, put the shield down...
And hop on!
[gasps]
- Hey!
- [shivering]
There you go.
- [Jack] You're having fun?
- [Zhao] Yeah.
I bet you didn't get too much of that growing up the way you did.
Fun?
No.
Well, when this is all over, you can make up for that.
Maybe you can come visit me.
I'll show you around, maybe get my Mom to take us to Disneyland or something.
I told you, I can never take off from my job.
Hey, man, look, you really got to get a life.
When you are responsible for a life, you don't have a life.
Okay.
Did you... did you, like, go to school to learn how to say things like that?
Like what?
[sighs] [imitates Zhao] "When you are responsible for a life", you don't have a life."
What's wrong with it?
Nothing's wrong with it, it just... sounds smart.
It does?
Yeah.
It does.
[chuckling]
II
[Zhao] So what's in Disneyland?
- [Jack] A lot of princesses.
- Oh!
- A Chinese one too.
- Ooh!
[soldiers yelling in Mandarin]
[Zhao, whispering] Get down, get down, get down!
- So you do have a plan, right?
- I told you the plan.
- Ah, right.
Get past the army.
- Yes.
- Get past the personal guards.
- Correct.
Get past the tower guards, find the princess,
- get past reinforcements.
- Good.
- Kill Arun.
- Exactly.
Crown Sulin Empress and save the country?
You're learning to listen.
Yeah, the real question is, do you have a plan to execute the plan?
- Hmm?
- [Jack stammers] [soldiers yelling in Mandarin] [soldiers hush]
- Good morning!
- Mm?
Uh...
[Jack] Great plan.
- Are we in the fortress?
- Yeah.
- Are we past the army?
- Yeah.
Have we passed the personal guards?
Almost.
Well, then I think that the plan is working.
I think the plan to get in is working.
How about a plan to get out?
I'm working on it.
Warrior Zhao,
I'm so honored that you've come all this way to attend my wedding.
I'm not here to attend your wedding.
I'm here to attend your funeral.
[chuckling]
- And you are?
- He's the Black Knight.
[stammering] I'm not the Black Knight, okay?
I'm Jack Bronson.
Jack Bronson...
I've got good news.
And I've got bad news.
The good news is, tomorrow, when my bride and I are married, we will stand, there.
And you two, will stand... there.
Okay.
What's the bad news?
As soon as we take our vows, and our new life begins... [trap door opening]
Your life ends.
II.
- He's not bluffing, is he?
- Arun doesn't do bluffs.
Maybe he'll be feeling generous on his wedding day and he'll pardon us.
Nun doesn't do generous.
Okay.
If he doesn't do this and he doesn't do that, is there anything that he does do?
- He murders and pillages.
- So in other words, we're dead.
When one door closes, another one opens.
[door opens]
See?
Dinner is served.
It's time to eat.
Uh... excuse me.
Uh, would you mind... you know, so we can...
Thank you.
[Brutus] Here.
[laughs] [both grunting]
[grunting continues]
[choking]
Dudes, I'm looking for the princess.
Know where she is?
[men yelling] [men grunting]
[Jack whispering] What now?
Now's the time to use what I've taught you.
- I'm not ready.
- Of course you are.
You're the Black Knight.
You have skills.
Okay.
I don't...
I don't get it.
'Cause one minute you're telling me I'm worthless and after a few lessons, I'm not?
It's not just me who thinks you are not worthless, Jack.
The way the princess looks at you?
She believes in you.
- She does?
- Now go rescue her.
Go!
' What's up?
Huh?
[growls]
' [Qmwling] - [yelling] [both grunting] [man yelling in Mandarin] [men grunting] [panting]

[grunts] [groans]
- [groaning]
- Jack.
Jack.
Are you okay?
I'm sorry.
[continues groaning]
You came to save me!
I guess. [Chuckles]
I knew you would.
You did?
From the very first.
[footsteps approaching] [speaking Mandarin]
Great plan, we did it.
Um... how do we get out of here?
I'm working on it.
You better work fast.
They're coming.
[yelling] [door thuds]
How many?
I don't know. 25?
I need to know exactly how many.
[soldiers yelling indistinctly]
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten... 13,14,15... 27, 28, 29, 30!
Thirty?
Thirty!
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.
- Thirty-one!
- 31!
31!

That worked.
[soldiers chattering in the distance]
Why do you still have this on?
I like it.
[indistinct chatter] [whispers] Come on, get on.
- Go!
Are you on?
- [straining]
- Are you on?
Get on, then!
- [straining] No, I'm not.

- Come on.
- [straining]
[thunder rumbling]
Amazing animals.
[horse whinnying]
Raised each and every one of them from birth.
Fed by my hand only.
Nursed them when they were sick.
They are more loyal than all my men.
They would die for me.
As will the two of you.
[thunder rumbling]
And you, my dear, by this time tomorrow, you and I will be husband and wife.
Emperor, and Empress.
Allow me, my love.
[thunder crashing]
Take them away.
- What are they doing?
- Ancient custom.
Last look.
Last meal.
So you know what you're missing.
[groans] Okay.
[keys jingle] [handcuffs unlock]
[wood creaking] [slurps]
- How can you eat?
- I'm hungry.
They're gonna kill us!
You should try it, it's actually pretty good.
I don't care if it's the best food in the world, man!
I'm Still a kid!
[scoffs] I got my whole life ahead of me.
Now there's a million things that I'm never gonna be able to do!
Like what?
Dude, I've never even kissed a girl!
Me neither.
You know, I was that close before you came in the room.
Yeah... but that's not the point.
- With the princess?
How close?
- That's not the point.
[wings fluttering]
[inaudible] [blows]
- What was that?
- A butterfly.
- You spoke to a butterfly?
- Apparently.
And it understood you?
Hopefully.

[Shaman] We are gathered here today to witness the marriage of Arun The Cruel,
The Mean, The Horrible,
The Terrible...
The Strong!
Can we move it along?
Uh... [clears throat]
[Jack] Hey.
I, uh...
I wanted to say thank you.
For what?
For trying to turn me into a warrior.
You were a warrior from the beginning, Jack, on the inside.
It just had to be brought out.
Yeah, a lot of good it did.
It's not over yet.
What do you mean, it's not over yet?
In a minute, she's gonna be married, and we're gonna be hanged.
Jack, worrying is not gonna change anything.
Just live in the moment.
No offense, but I think we've run out of moments.
Do you, Arun, take Sulin, in sickness and in health,
- for better and worse...
- I do.
She does.
"I now pronounce you man and wife."
Uh... uh... [clears throat]
To make it official, you must now kiss the bride.

Not even a grown man.
Run along.

You run along and I'll let you live.
Let me think about it.
No.
I think I'll stay, I think I'll take one leg.

[door squeaks open]
Hey, Zhao!
The Empress requests your presence.
[stammering] Okay, I'm just waiting on the Wizard.
Jack, if the Empress summons you, you must come at once.
He said he'd be right back.
It is the rule.
Or what, huh?
I get my head chopped off?
You guys and your rules, man.
It's also against the rules to smile?
- Hi.
- Hey.
Wow.
What, sure I'm not gonna get my head chopped off?
There's no one here to see.
- Okay.
- [soft chuckle]
I wanted to see you before you went back.
Actually, I wish I could go with you, even for one day.
You are the Empress now, you can do whatever you want.
Because I'm the Empress, I can't.
Every minute of every day from now on will be filled with ministers and ambassadors, and papers to sign and decisions to make.
No dancing, no singing.
- No fun.
- [sighs]
I would love to go to the mall, to eat ice cream.
- [chuckles]
- But I...
I can't.
My father worked so hard to bring peace to the whole country.
I can't let him down.
He gave his life for our people.
I owe it to him.
I understand.
But I did want to thank you for giving me memories that I will always treasure.
I want to give you one I hope you will too.

[whispers] I don't think you're worthless.
I never did.
Goodbye, Jack.

He must die!

You see?
[Chuckles]
Okay!
It's not ready, man?
Come on!
Hurry!
- Relax.
- Jack!
So, after all we've been through, you're gonna kill me?
Really?
Rules are rules.
If we did not live by them, we'd be nothing more than barbarians.
II.
Unless we can make an exception.
[exhales sharply]
Sometimes it's good to be a little flexible, right?
I hate you. [Chuckles]
Here.
Thank you.
Goodbye, Jack Bronson.
I will never forget you and the lesson you taught me.

It's done.
The last missing piece of wood.

I'LL BE BACK AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.
IF ANYTHING HAPPENS TO HER..

I DIDN'T SAY THAT.

OK.
SORRY.
HELLO, WHAT IS YOUR NAME, YOUNG MAN?
- JACK.
- OH JACK, WELCOME JACK.
IS SOMETHING WRONG?
NO, YOU JUST LOOK A LOT LIKE SOMEONE I KNOW.
IS HE HANDSOME?
YES.
OK, NOW LET'S GO FIND THE PRINCESS.
- CAN YOU EXPLAIN SOMETHING TO ME?
- IF I CAN.
- WELL LET'S START WITH THE CHEST.
- THE WARRIOR'S GATE.
- THAT'S THE REAL NAME.
- AND HOW DOES IT WORK?
THAT'S COMPLICATED.
IT HAS TO DO WITH TIMES, SPACES, MAGIC..
AND THINGS BEYOND EXPLAINING.
THE MAIN THING IS THAT IT'S WORKS.
- THEN HOW DO I GET BACK.
- ANOTHER CHEST.
THERE'S ANOTHER CHEST?
GREAT, WHERE IS IT?
WELL, THAT IS COMPLICATED.
I HAVE TO COLLECT FOUR DIFFERENT WOODS..
FROM 4 DIFFERENT TREES THAT GROW IN FOUR DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE COUNTRY.
NORTH WHERE ZIPPA WOOD IS FOUND.
SOUTH WHERE THE SPOTTED BAMBOO GROWS.
EAST WHERE THE BLACK MAHOGANY LIVES.
AND WEST WHERE THE RAREST TREE IN ALL THE LAND IS FOUND.
THAT'S THE ONLY WAY TO BUILD A NEW BOX.
BUT FIRST LET'S FIND THE PRINCESS.
YOU KNOW WHERE SHE IS?
ANOTHER COMPLICATED QUESTION.
HOW ABOUT AN EASY ONE, HUH?
ZHAO.
TELL ME ABOUT ZHAO.
THAT'S EASY.
WARRIOR ZHAO WAS ONE OF THE SEVEN COMPANIONS..
RAISED FROM BIRTH BY THE SACRED MONKS..
FOR ONE THING AND ONE THING ONLY.
TO PROTECT THE EMPEROR.
THE MONKS TRAIN THE 7 COMPANIONS DAY AND NIGHT,
YEAR IN AND YEAR OUT, UNTIL THEY WOULD BE MOST INVINCIBLE FORCE.
IT WAS THEIR SOLE PURPOSE IN LIFE TO PROTECT THE EMPEROR..
WHILE BROUGHT PEACE TO THE LAND.
THERE WAS NOT A MAN ALIVE WHO COULD DEFEAT THEM.
EXCEPT ONE.
ARUN THE CRUEL, KING OF BARBARIANS.
AS FATE WOULD HAVE IT.
ZHAO WAS ON THE MISSION AND THEY FIGURE IT OUT.
THE FOOD HAS BEEN POISONED.
FEELING THE WORSE.
HE RUSH TO PROTECT THE EMPEROR.
BUT HE ARRIVED TOO LATE.
AND THEN CHAOS DESCENDED FROM THE NORTH.
AND THE PEACE THAT EMPEROR HAD WORK SO HARD TO BUILT BEGAN TO FALL APART.
WITH NO LEADER THE ARMY WAS LOST.
THE PEOPLE WERE LOST.
THE ZHAO FOUGHT RELENTLESSLY BUT AS GREAT AS WARRIOR AS HE WAS.
HE NEEDED A HELP OF THE GREATEST WARRIOR THAT COULD BE FOUND.
AND SO, BY USING THE CYNIC STONE.
I FOUND YOU.
YES.
AND WE PASS THROUGH THE WARRIORS GATE
TO GET HELP PROTECTING THE GREATEST TREASURE WE POSSESSED.
- SHUMAN?
- SULIN.
THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN RALLY THE PEOPLE TO DEFEAT.
THE BARBARIANS AND SAVE OUR KINGDOMS.
BUT I'M NOT BE ABLE TO HELP HIM.
HE THINKS I AM WORTHLESS.
OH, YOU SEEMS MIGHT.
BUT I DON'T.
- BASED ON WHAT?
- YOU'RE HERE.
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO BE.
YOU COULD'VE STAY AT HOME.
THAT'S SOMETHING ABOUT WHO YOU ARE.
AM I CRAZY?
AND NOW IF YOU WILL EXCUSE ME.
I HAVE A LOT OF WOOD TO COLLECT.
SEE YOU.
BYE-BYE.
COME ON, LET'S GO.
YOU KNOW THE OLD SAYING ABOUT BLAMING THE BURIAL IS BAD NEWS.
YES, YOUR HIGHNESS.
- YOU BELIEVE IT'S TRUE?
- I HOPE NOT, YOUR HIGHNESS.
GOOD NEWS, YOU'RE GETTING MARRY.
BAD NEWS.
WARRIOR ZHAO IS ON HIS WAY.
KILL HIM.
BRUTUS, NOT HIM, KILL ZHAO.
UPS.
- SO, I ASSUMED YOU HAVE A PLAN.
- I DO.
SAVE THE PRINCESS.
PREVENT THE MARRIED.
OH?
SHE IS GETTING MARRIED?
FORCE TO.
UNLESS WE STOP IT.
- AH..
WHO IS THE GROOM?
- ARUN THE CRUEL.
AH, IS IT HIS NAME?
HIS FULL NAME IS ARUM THE CRUEL, THE HORRIBLE, THE TERRIBLE, THE MISERABLE.
BUT WE KEEP IT SHORT.
IF THE MARRY TAKES PLACE..
ONCE SHE BECOME EMPRESS, HE BECOME EMPEROR.
AND ONCE HE IS AN EMPEROR.
HE WILL KILL HER AND THE WHOLE COUNTRY IS DOOM.
ARE YOU FINISH WITH DINNER?
- I GUESS.
- YEAH, WE SLEEP.
I KNOW, I KNOW, WE ARE RAFTING IT BUT DO WE HAVE ANY, BLANKETS AND PILLOWS?
BLANKETS?
NO.
PILLOWS.
YES.
GOOD NIGHT.
LET SAY YOU HAVE RESCUE THE PRINCESS.
- IS SHE HAVE ANYONE ELSE MIGHT TO MARRY?
- NOT YET.
ANY IDEA WHAT KIND HUSBAND SHE LOOKING FOR?
CAUSE IN THE LITTLE TIME WE SPEND TOGETHER, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I THOUGHT WE HAVE SOMETHING.
YOU KNOW, CONNECTION.
CAUSE WE LIKE THE SAME CLOTHES, WE LIKE THE SAME MUSICS.
- YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T THINK THAT..
- NO, I DON'T THINK, JACK BRONSON.
SHE'S LOOKING FOR SOMEONE GOOD, SOMEONE BRAVE, A HERO.
YEAH.
SEIZED IN THE RIGHT OF CAPITAL OF CHUNGHAI PROVINCE.
1.600 BRICKS OF SILVER, 18.000 BRICKS OF GOLD.
6 CHESTS OF DIAMONDS.
AND 26 SLAVES.
- ONLY 26 SLAVES?
- YES, I KNOW.
WE'RE UNDER PERFORMING IN THAT DEPARTMENT.
WHO IS IN CHARGE OF SLAVES?
MY COUSIN.
GET RID OF HIM.
BRUTUS, I MEAN THE COUSIN.
NOT HIM!
UPS.
A SECOND MOMENT HERE, BIG FELLA.
NOW, I KNOW YOU WANT TO PLEASE ME, BUT NEXT TIME..
BEFORE YOU KILL SOMEONE.
SHOULD WE HAVE A SIGNAL, MAYBE?
LIKE, SOMETHING LIKE THAT?
LIKE, SIGNAL?
LIKE THAT?
A SIGNAL LIKE THAT?
- LIKE THAT?
YES.
- KILL.
THAT'S THE SIGNAL.
- YES.
- THAT'S THE SIGNAL.
YOUR HIGHNESS.
- GET HER DOWN.
- FINALLY.
BEAUTIFUL BRIDE HAS ARRIVE.
HELLO, MY LOVE.
HOW ARE YOU?
TIRED FROM YOUR LONG TRIP.
- NEED A HOT BATH?
- STAY THERE!
- A HUNK OF MILK, MAYBE?
- HOLD!
SOON, MY LOVE.
SOON.
YOU AND ME.
LET'S MOVE!
YOU AND ME!
- GO!
GO!
- CALL THE TAILOR FOR FITTING!
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- IT'S GONNA RAIN.
THERE'S NO CLOUD.
NOT ALL RAIN COME FROM CLOUD.
OH MY GOD!
OH MY GOD!
LOOK AT THIS!
WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?
HE WANTS ME DEAD.
- SO THEY KNOW WE ARE HERE?
- THEY KNOW WE'RE SOMEWHERE AROUND HERE.
SO THEY'RE JUST KEEP SHOOTING ARROWS EVERYWHERE AND HOPE TO GET LUCKY.
WE CALLED IT THE MORNING SHOWER.
WHY DON'T YOU WAKE ME UP?
I COULD BEEN DEAD.
IF I WANT YOU DEAD, I WILL DO IT MYSELF.
YOU HAVE TO LEARN TO LISTEN.
- WHAT IS SAID?
- DO NOT ENTER.
- AND WHAT'S IN THERE?
- THE UNKNOWN LAND.
- WHAT IS IN THE UNKNOWN LAND?
- UNKNOWN THINGS.
OKAY, WAIT, BUT..
YOU ARE DROP ME OFF TO THE WIZARD, RIGHT?
- WRONG.
- OKAY, LOOK, I REALLY THINK..
IS ABOUT TIME WE THOUGHT ABOUT GETTING ME HOME?
- SO DO I. HERE.
- WHAT IS THIS?
A MAP.
IT WILL TAKE YOU TO THE WIZARD.
I..
I CAN'T READ THIS.
I JUST WANT TO GO HOME AND YOU ARE NOT HELPING.
- I GAVE YOU A MAP.
- SO BASICALLY IT'S SCREW YOU, JACK.
I BROUGHT YOU HERE AGAINST YOUR WILL, I KIDNAPPED YOU,
AND NOW YOU'RE NOT THE PERSON I THOUGH YOU WERE.
SO, ADIOS AMIGO.
YOU ARE NOT MY PROBLEM.
WRONG AT NUMBER ONE.
I DID NOT KIDNAP YOU.
NO ONE NEED YOU JUMP INTO THAT CHEST.
RIGHT ON NUMBER TWO.
YOU ARE NOT MY PROBLEM.
MY PROBLEM IS TO GET THROUGH THE UNKNOWN LAND.
GET PASS THE ARUM'S ARMY.
PASS HIS PERSONAL GUARDS.
PASS THE TERROR GUARDS.
FIND THE PRINCESS, GET PASS THE TOWER'S REINFORCEMENT.
PASS THE PERSONAL GUARD'S REINFORCEMENT.
KILL ARUM.
AND THEN BRING THE PRINCESS BACK SO SHE CAN BE MADE EMPRESS WHO SAVE THE COUNTRY.
THAT IS MY PROBLEM.
SO YOU'RE SAYING I DON'T HAVE A CHOICE.
YOU DO HAVE A CHOICE.
YOU CAN SAVE YOURSELF OR YOU CAN SAVE HER.
- I CAN'T SAVE A PRINCESS!
- YOU ARE THE BLACK KNIGHT.
- OH, YEAH, I ALMOST FORGOT.
- SIR, SIR..
SIR..
GOOD NEWS.
DON'T BE NERVOUS.
IT'S BEEN MY LUCKY DAYS SO FAR.
- AND I'VE GOOD FEELING ABOUT THIS ONE.

I'M SURE, IT'S GOOD NEWS.
BAD NEWS.

I WAS THINKING.
THIS ARUM DUDE, MAYBE IF HE GETS WHAT HE WANT, HE'LL CHANGE, YOU KNOW.
BE LIKE ARUM THE KIND?
DO YOU HAVE PEOPLE IN YOUR WORLD WHO GET WHAT THEY WANT BY THREATING TO DO BAD THINGS?
AT LEAST THERE IS ONE KID.
AND YOU GIVE HIM WHAT HE WANTS.
DOES HE CHANGE?
NOT REALLY.
MIGHT DOES NOT MAKE RIGHT, JACK.
RIGHT MAKES RIGHT.
IF YOU DON'T STAND UP FOR WHAT IS RIGHT, AND WHY YOU STAND UP AT ALL?
YOU KNOW, THAT'S EASY TO SAY.
THIS, THIS KID, HE IS BIGGER THEN ME.
HE'S STRONGER THEN ME.
SO WHAT DO YOU DO?
- I RUN.
- IS THAT SOLVE YOUR PROBLEM?
NO.
- SO YOU GOT A GIRL?

- THERE'S NO ONE HERE TO SEE.
- OKAY.
I WANTED TO SEE YOU BEFORE YOU WENT BACK.
ACTUALLY I WISH I COULD GO WITH YOU.
- EVEN FOR ONE DAY.
- YOU ARE THE EMPRESS NOW.
YOU CAN DO WHATEVER YOU WANT.
BECAUSE I'M THE EMPRESS I CAN'T.
EVERY MINUTES OF EVERYDAY FROM NOW ON WILL BE FILLED WITH.
MINISTERS, AMBASSADORS, AND PAPER TO SIGNING, DECISION TO MAKE.
- NO DANCING.
NO SINGING.
- NO FUN.
I WOULD LOVE TO GO TO THE MALL TO EAT ICE CREAM, BUT..
I..
I CAN'T.
MY FATHER WORKED SO HARD TO BRING PEACE TO THE WHOLE COUNTRY.
I CAN'T LET HIM DOWN.
HE GAVE HIS LIFE FOR OUR PEOPLE I OWE IT TO HIM.
I UNDERSTAND.
BUT I DID WANT TO THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME MEMORIES THAT I WILL ALWAYS TREASURED.
I WANT TO GIVE ONE THAT I HOPE YOU WILL, TOO.
I DON'T THINK YOU'RE WORTHLESS.

Please rate and thank.
My hero...
You are the winner.
Oh, he shoots, he scores.
Come on Black Knight strikes again.
Jack!
When is this gonna get cleaned up?
You know people are coming to see the house.
- Yeah I'm doing homework.
- Homework?
- Yeah homework.
- You think I'm clueless?
- No, I'm working on that.
- Homework.
- I've never seen that before.
- Let me operate the computer.
Hey, I don't mean to put pressure on you sweetie, but you really gotta do great at school.
'Cause at this point I, I just...
I can't afford college.
You gotta get a scholarship.
Is nothing selling?
6 months, not a house...
Not an apartment.
Hey Mr. Chang, says everything happens for a reason...
Yeah, you know what?
Well Mr. Chang... is not getting his home foreclosed on in 90 days.
I'm sorry.
I know he's your friend and...
It's really sweet of him to give you a job and everything, but...
We don't need philosophy.
We need a break.
Hey...
- How's it going with Travis and them?
- Oh it's fine.
- No more bullying.
- I just told you.
Okay.
- I love you.
- Love you too.
No more gaming, until you finish your homework.
- Is that a threat?
- Yup.
I am Octoman!
- Hector you dork, an octopus has 8 arms.
- Whatever.
Look who's here?
- Watch this dork!
- Oh no Travis.
- Let's wreck this track.
- Like that, you like that!
Like that huh?
Bye bye!
- Run away Jack!
- How come your not gettin' outta here.
That's for sure.
- You show him, Travis.
- Get outta the way.
Hey Travis, you all right man?
Oh gosh, I'm, I'm, I'm, really sorry.
How many times I gotta tell you?
This is our spot.
You said the park on Magnolia was your spot, you didn't say anything about this.
Any place there's a ramp.
That's ours.
You almost killed me.
Twerp.
I'm sorry okay?
It was an accident.
Accident or not...
Still gonna kick your ass.
Not getting away that easy.
Well come on, waiting for, let's go!
Hurry boys!
Come on!
Go, boys!
Let's go boys!
Go, go, go, go!
Oh gate!
Hey, watch it kid!
Get outta the way man!
- Watch it!
- This way!
Come on, come on, come on!
Wow, wow, wow!
I'm sorry mam!
Okay...
- Come on, come on, hurry up, hurry up!
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no!
Hey!
Fool, whaddaya doing?
Whaddaya goin' to a frat party?
- Where'd he go?
- Move, get outta the, way!
What's your problem?
- Problem again?
- I'm in trouble still.
You should use some of your moves from your game, Jack.
Kick some butt.
This ain't the gaming world Mr. Chang, this is real world.
One's get nothing to do with the other.
- Bravery is bravery.
- Look at me.
Look do I...
Do I even look like I have one ounce of brave in me?
Looking and being are 2 different things, young Jack.
Well in this case, here's what you see is what you get.
Well, let's see if I can get some work out of my employee.
Yeah okay.
How are thing at home?
Moms worried about money.
Real estate markets dead.
She hasn't sold anything in months.
Looks like we're gonna have to move.
Wish I could do something to help her out.
Medical app or something?
What's all this?
The new shipment from my cousin in Beijing.
Help me open it.
- Mr. Chang what's this?
- It has been in my family since...
Forever.
- You like it?
- Yeah I do.
- The dancing Princess.
- Yeah looks like she's breaking.
- You know, like...
- Oh god...
See look?
I don't think so young Jack.
She lived a long...
Long...
Time ago.
She saved a country from the barbarians.
Talk about brave, she was brave.
This little girl can kick butt, big time.
Where do I put it?
- How about your house?
- Whaddaya mean?
I mean...
A present...
- No Mr. Chang...
I can't...
I can't...
- Oh sure you can.
You watch the shop while I going on vacations.
- Oh but you already over paid me for that.
- Bad manners to refuse a gift.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- Hey so I have an idea.
- What?
This house...
Really kinda too big for both of us.
I mean when dad was here fine.
But now...
You know...
Maybe we should think about renting a room out.
Ya know to some kid from the university or something.
What did I do to deserve a kid like you?
Win the lottery?
- Night.
- Night.
- Where is the Black Knight?
- What?
Hey!
Where is the Black Knight?
- I...
I'm the Black Knight.
- You lie!
You die!
Black Knight, it's Octoman.
- Hey wait, wait.
- I'll challenge you to a duel to the death.
It's a video game!
It's a video game!
Okay?
I just...
I just want to show you man.
I'm 8 arms now bro.
Okay you see that's the challenger and that's me, the Black Knight.
It is true...
Yeah it's me.
Hey look when I move...
He moves.
Fight!
You are the winner.
Just you wait man, I'm gonna come back with 12 arms.
So you're the Black Knight.
In the game world, I'm the Black Knight.
In this world I'm Jack Bronson.
Jack Bronsons worthless to me.
But I don't have a choice.
Jack Bronson, I need your help.
For what?
I need you to guard the most precious treasure of the empire.
Excuse me?
Your majesty, you can come out.
The Princess and future Empress.
Hi, I'm Jack.
Anyone who touches the Princess dies.
That is the rule.
No exceptions?
There's no point in having a rule, if you have an exception.
Sometimes is good to be a little flexible.
It's useless.
But I don't have a choice.
I'll be back as soon as possible.
If anything happens to her...
I'm hallucinating, this is crazy, this isn't happening, this isn't happening.
- Where are your weapons?
- My weapons?
Warrior Zhao, said you were going to protect me.
To protect me, you need to have skills, and weapons.
Hey you know, I...
I think warrior Zhao's, a little confused 'cause...
I'm not the Black Knight.
I don't have skills, or weapons.
So warrior Zhao was right, you are worthless.
Okay, you know what, can we start over?
I'm Jack...
- What do I call you?
- Your Highness.
- I meant your name.
- Sulin.
- Okay.
- I'm hungry Jack.
Bring be swallow nest soup.
Roasted snail, the big kind.
Oh, and duck tongues in hot chilli sauce.
I'll see what I can do.
Not bad.
Sulin?
No, no, no, no.
Hey, just in time.
Hey, how'd you sleep?
Great, ah, how'd you sleep?
Good.
- Do want to sit down?
- Um, no, no, um.
Because, I read that it's better for digestion if you're standing.
I never heard that.
Okay, I'll do the dishes.
No, no, I'll do it mom, leave it mom, I'll do dishes today.
Excuse me, what?
You have to go to work, the bridge's down, this traffic, your gonna be late.
- The bridge?
- Yeah.
No, you gotta go, you're gonna be late.
- Okay I need my keys...
- Got it, please... ok.
Hey, I am gonna go see aunt Sophie tomorrow, do you wanna come with?
Oh no, I gotta a lot of stuff to do, like homework.
Yeah, bye bye.
Okay, you gotta come inside.
Hey, I am not joking.
God!
Ok, stay here, don't move.
Whaddup, man?
!
So, howja like my octopus, bro?
Lame.
Damn, it's a prototype, yo, just gimme some time.
- I'll be killing it 8 arms and shit.
- Hello.
Hello?
You gonna intro me, bro?
- This is Hector.
- Octoman, yo.
Oc-to-man, this is, her Highness.
- Really?
That's her name?
- Yeah, that's it.
Well, pound it up, your Highness.
No!
Oh dude, I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry, you ok?
Yeah, it's cool man, I kinda worry, you know. ?
So what's the story here?
It's complicated, I don't really wanna talk about it right now.
- You know what I mean.
- Dude, the girl is hot.
- You gonna hook up?
- Not, if you keep asking... stupid questions like that.
You tell me all about it though, right?
- Every last detail.
- Right, catch you two lovebirds later.
You can't do that!
He want to hit me.
No, he went to fist bump you!
It's a greeting, like a handshake.
Didn't you hear warrior Zhao?
No one touch your Princess, you get your head chopped off.
- That's the rule.
- Ok, maybe where you come from that's the rule, but here, here the rules are different.
When you go back to your world, you can chop off as many heads as you want, I promise.
But here, my world, my rules, ok?
Ok.
No!
What are you doing?
Observing your world, so I can learn the rules better.
No, no, no, you have to go back inside.
How am I going to learn the rules of your world if I don't see it?
Well you can't, go out dressed like that.
- Why not?
- Because...
'Cause, they will stare, and wonder what the hell is going on.
If I was dressed differently, could I stand here?
Yes.
Then call the tailor and, have him make me new clothes.
- We don't get our clothes from the tailor.
- Then take me where you do.
This for a man.
- You okay?
- What's that?
- That's ice cream, it's food.
- What does it taste like?
Well, first it's cold, then it's sweet.
I want one.
Ok what flavor do you want?
They have chocolate, vanilla, strawberry, cherry and mint chip.
um, I want all of them.
All of 'em?
Ok.
Ok.
- Girl, you're the shit.
- Hey, hey hey, here's your ice cream.
- We gotta go.
- That was fun.
- Yeah, good?
- I like them all, Jack, thank you for bringing me here.
You're welcome.
What did he mean, I'm the shit?
Ah well, when you really like something, that's what we say.
Hey mom.
- Hello.
- I had ice cream.
Yeah, I can see that.
Mom, I uh, forget to tell you, um.
Yesterday in school, they asked someone to volunteer to take an exchange student, and, Sulin showed up today.
Oh your fresh off the boat, ha?
No boat, I came by box.
- What?
- Oh she meant plane.
Plane, because box and plane are the same in her language.
What's the plane?
- She does this all the time.
- I thought she just gotten here.
- She did.
- But you just said all the time.
I did, um, I meant, that in the time she's been here.
- Are you ok with this?
- Yeah, I mean...
- Ah, no, no, no.
- Sulin, it's so nice to meet you.
I am Jack's mom, I'm Annie.
I am so hungry.
Um, sure we have salad, and fresh corn and, hamburgers.
Sulin do you like hamburgers?
I like snails, like Jack made me last night.
Last night?
The Chinese grammar, they get their past and future tenses mixed up a lot.
You know you're acting very, weird.
Why don't you put the burgers on.
Sulin and I will go make up the couch, and the guess room for her.
Hey, I'm gonna be gone tomorrow but maybe when I get back we can, um, get to know each other little better?
Maybe we can go to the mall, it's the shit.
- Who told you that?
- Jack.
Ok, um, this is where you're gonna be sleeping.
- She said that?
- To my mom.
- That is ill dude.
- Hector, give me a break.
I don't know, man, the girl is hot.
Things I would do to her...
Good night Hector.
Excuse me, the bed next door, is in the wrong position.
Very bad feng shui, I can't sleep.
This one good feng shui.
Oh, don't forget to clean the house.
Oh don't worry, you won't recognize the place when get back.
- Say hi to aunt Sophie.
- Sure.
- Where is she?
- Who the hell are you?
- Where is the Princess?
- Listen man, I don't know, ok?
I'm here.
No, no, no!
Jack!
Jack!
Jack!
Jack!
Jack!
Jack!
Ok, I told you not to let her outta of your sight.
- Your worthless!
- I'm not a warrior!
- I don't know what you're expecting.
- I was expecting more.
Ok, well how about this for more, when I saw she was taken by those...
Whatever the hell those were, I jumped right in after 'em, man, ok?
What more do you want?
And by the way, we came the same way seconds apart, she should be here.
- She's not.
- Well where is she then?
- I don't know.
- How you could not know?
I was right behind her.
I was busy!
Maybe she came in and ran out.
She's probably right outside.
Wait, don't!
Oops.
Ok, ok.
I don't want you to think I am backing' out on you, 'cause I'm not, but you know, I got a lot of homework to do... and I should be getting back by now, just go back the way I came.
It's not gonna happen.
So I'm stuck here, there's no other way out?
I didn't say that.
- I'm not in charge of transportation.
- Well who is?
The wizard is.
And where's the wizard?
- Jack Bronson.
- I wouldn't do that.
Wake up!
Stop!
Never wake a sleeping wizard.
What, I'll get my head chopped off?
Yes, how did you know?
Lucky guess.
What is it with you people chopping off heads?
I mean, really.
It's effective.
Close the door!
Cut the rope!
Get behind me!
Open the door.
There's like thousands of...
Just open it.
Ok.
Sorry.
Hello.
- What is your name, young man?
- Jack.
Oh Jack, welcome Jack.
Is, something wrong?
No, you just look a lot like someone I know.
Is he, handsome?
Yes.
Ok, now let's go find the Princess.
- Can you explain something to me?
- If I can.
- Well let's start with the chest.
- The Warrior's Gate.
- That's the real name.
- How does it work?
That's complicated.
It has to do with time, space, magic, and things beyond explaining.
The main thing is, that it works.
- Then how do I get back.
- Another, chest.
There's another chest?
Great, where is it?
Well, that is complicated.
I have to collect four different woods...
From 4 different trees that grow in four different parts of the country.
North, where zippa wood is found.
South, where the spotted bamboo grows.
East, where the black mahogany lives.
And west, where the rarest tree, in all the land is found.
That's the only way to build a new box.
- But first, let's find the Princess.
- You know where she is?
Oh, another complicated question.
How about an easy one, huh?
Zhao.
Tell me about Zhao.
That's easy.
Warrior Zhao was one of the seven companions...
Raised from birth by the sacred monks...
For one thing and one thing only.
To protect the Emperor.
The monks train the 7 companions day and night, year in and year out, until, they would most invincible force.
It was their sole purpose in life to protect the Emperor...
While he brought peace to the land.
There was not a man alive who could defeat them.
Except one.
Arun the cruel, king of barbarians.
As fate would have it...
Zhao was on a mission, and they figured out, the food had been poisoned.
Fearing the worst, he rush to protect the Emperor.
But, he arrived too late.
And then, chaos descended from the north.
And the peace, that Emperor had worked so hard to built, began to fall apart.
With no leader, the army was lost.
The people were lost.
The Zhao fought relentlessly, but as great a warrior as he was... he needed the help of the greatest warrior that could be found.
And so, by using the cynic stone.
I found you.
Yes.
And we pass through the warriors gate... to get help protecting the greatest treasure, we possess.
- Sulin?
- Sulin.
The only one who can rally the people to defeat, the barbarians, and save our kingdom.
But I'm not gonna be able to help him, he thinks I'm worthless.
Oh, yes he might.
But I don't.
- Based on what?
- You are here.
You didn't have to be.
You could've stayed home.
And that says something about, who you are.
I'm crazy.
And now if you will excuse me, I have a lot of wood, to collect.
See you.
Bye-bye.
Come on, let's go.
You know the old saying about blaming the bearer of bad news?
Yes, your Highness.
- Do you believe it's true?
- I hope not, your Highness.
Good news, you're getting married.
Bad news, warrior Zhao is on his way.
Kill him.
Brutus, not him, kill Zhao.
Oops!
So I assume you have a plan?
I do, save the Princess, prevent a marriage.
Oh wait, she's getting married?
Forced to.
Unless we stop it.
Um, who's the groom?
Arun the cruel.
That's his name?
His full name is Arum the cruel, the horrible, the terrible, the miserable.
But we keep it short.
If the marry takes place, once she become Empress, he become Emperor.
And once he's Emperor, he will kill her, and the whole country is doomed.
Are you finished with dinner?
- I guess.
- Yeah, we sleep.
I know, I know, we're ruffing it but do we have any, blankets and pillows?
Blankets?
No.
Pillow, yes.
Good night.
Lets just say we rescue the Princess.
Does she have anyone else in mind to marry?
Not yet.
Any idea what kind of husband she's looking for?
Cause in the little, time that we spend together, you know I... felt like we had somethin', you know, connection.
Cause we like the same clothes, we like the same music.
- You know, you don't think that.
- No, I don't think, Jack Bronson.
She's looking for someone good, someone brave, a hero.
Yeah.
Seized in the right of the capital of Chunghai Province.
1,600 bricks of silver, 18,000 bricks of gold, 6 chests of diamonds.
And 26, slaves.
- Only 26 slaves?
- Yes, I know.
We are under performing in that department.
Who is in charge of slaves?
My cousin.
Get rid of him.
Brutus, I meant the cousin.
Not him!
Oops!
Lets take a moment here, big fella.
Now I know you wanna please me, but, next time... before you kill someone, should we have a, a signal, maybe?
Like, somethin' like that?
Like, a signal?
Like that?
A signal like that?
- Like that?
Yes.
- Kill.
That's the signal.
- Yes.
- That's the signal.
Your Highness.
- Get down.
- Finally.
Beautiful bride has arrived.
Hello, my love.
How are you?
Tired from your long trip.
Need of a hot bath?
A home cooked meal, maybe?
Soon, my love.
Soon.
You and me.
You and me.
Call the tailor for fitting.
- What are you doing?
- It's gonna rain.
There's no clouds.
Not all rain come from clouds.
Oh my god!
Oh my god!
Boy is it raining!
The hell's going on?
He wants me dead.
- Ok, so they know we are here?
- They know we're somewhere around here.
So they just keep shootin', arrows everywhere and hope they get lucky.
We call it the morning shower.
Why didn't you wake me up?
I could've been dead.
If I wanted you dead, I'd do it myself.
You have to learn to listen.
- Whats it say?
- Do not enter.
- Well what's in there?
- The unknown lands.
- What's in the unknown lands?
- Unknown things.
Okay wait but, you are, dropping' me off at the wizards, right?
Wrong.
Okay, look, I really think it's about time we, thought about getting me home?
- So do I. Here.
- What's this?
A map.
It'll take you to the wizard.
I...
I can't read this.
I just wanna go home and you're not helping.
- I gave you a map.
- Ok, so basically, it's screw you Jack, huh.
I brought you here against your will, I kidnapped you.
And now that you're not the person I though you were, it's, adios amigo.
You're not my problem.
Wrong on number one, I did not kidnap you.
No one made you jump into that chest.
Right on number two.
You are not my problem.
My problem, is to get through the unknown lands.
Get passed Arum's army.
Pass his personal guard.
Pass the tower guards.
Find the Princess, get passed the tower reinforcement.
Pass the personal guard reinforcement.
Kill Arum.
And then bring the Princess back so she can be made Empress and save the country.
That, is my problem.
So you're saying I don't have a choice.
You do have a choice.
You can save yourself, or you can save her.
- I can't save a Princess!
- You're the Black Knight.
- Oh, yeah, I almost forgot.
- Sire, sire...
Sir...
Good news.
Don't be nervous.
It's been my lucky day so far.
- And I've good feeling about this one.
- Yes, sire.
I'm sure, it's good news.
Bad news.
- No, impossible...
- There is no sign, of the warrior Zhao.
Sire... sire...
Brutus...
No, no...
- Signal, you remember, the signal?
- Signal?
- Kill him!
- No, no, no, no!
Sire!
Sire!
Ya know I was thinking.
This Arum dude, maybe if he gets what he wants he'll change, ya know, be like Arum the kind?
Do you have people in your world who get what they want by threating to do bad things?
Well there's this one kid.
And when you give him what he wants, does he change?
Not really.
Might does not make right, Jack.
Right makes right.
If you don't stand up for what is right, then why stand up at all?
You know, that's easy to say.
This, this kid, he's, he's bigger then me, he's stronger then me.
So what do you do?
- I run.
- Does that solve your problem?
No.
- So you got a girl?
- No.
- Because?
- Because I have my job.
What your, job doesn't leave time for a personal life?
My job is my life.
That doesn't sound like much fun.
Fun?
Yeah, you know, doin' things that make you feel good.
I feel good doing my job.
You can't always, ah, you know, dude come on.
You ever seen this before?
No, okay, look.
It's called dancing, okay?
It's like, ah, um...
No?
Okay, try this out.
Well, just, stay still.
Don't wanna, poke your eye out.
There you go.
- Magic?
- It's cool.
Okay, um, I'm gonna lay it on the beat.
And, you just move your hips, okay?
I don't have time for fun.
Man, come on.
Come on!
We don't have all day.
Wow.
Excuse me.
But we have to get through.
And I need, to finish cooking my soup.
How long is that going to take?
- All night.
- We don't, we don't have all night.
You do now.
Perhaps, if we move the...
Respect your eldest one!
No disrespect, but we have a very important mission that we have to get through.
Well, your really important mission will have to wait!
For my potatoes, to soften.
I'm sorry.
- It can't.
- No!
Over here!
You don't look so happy.
Here!
Think scary.
Help me up, Zhao!
Come on, Jack!
Come on!
I did not sign up for this!
I'm on fire!
I hate fire!
Maybe not so worthless after all.
Your welcome.
My bride.
I hope you like your new palace.
And in two days time, you will take your place next to me.
Of course, your throne will be, much more.
I would rather die!
Whatever make you happy, my dear.
You want to see me happy, huh?
Just tell me what I need to do, and it will be done.
Well...
Come close, and, I will whisper it.
In your ear.
Tell me my love!
My sweet, song bird.
What do I need to do, to make you happy?
Die!
As much as I'd like to make you happy, me dying is not on the agenda.
However, if you insist on someone dying, it can be arranged.
Keep her away.
Come on!
Get inside!
Your dinner.
Get out!
Invisible woman.
How do the princess people place boxes that time travel, ?
and none of this is weird to you, is it?
It's not weird.
It just magic.
We don't have magic.
Then how you do explain what cannot be explained?
We have science, science explanes everything.
- Does science explain, a rainbow, or snowflake?
- Yes.
But does it explain how you feel, when you see the rainbow or snowflake?
No.
- So you do have magic.
- Feelings aren't magic.
- What are they then?
- I don't know, there feelings.
Okay, they make you do and, say things you normally wouldn't, do or say, like, like...
If you met this girl you never knew, and all of a sudden there's...
Can't think anything to say, but you can't stop talking.
And your bodys like hot and cold at the same time and...
Your heart's beating like you just ran a mile in a minute, and it's, it's, it's like...
Magic?
Yeah, I guess.
Help!
Help!
Are you okay?
- My sister is trapped.
- What?
There.
Please come help us.
Look, I really have to stay.
Please.
I...
I'm...
Please.
- Fine, fine, fine okay.
- Please.
Thank you.
Oh, thank goodness.
Hurry!
Wait, you're twins?
No, we are not.
We're triplets.
And you are...
Dinner!
Come on, let me down!
Zhao!
Zhao!
Zhao!
Zhao!
Help!
Zhao!
Zhao!
Aw!
He's the cute one.
Cute ones always taste better.
Oh, no, the fat ones taste better.
Fat ones give me gas.
If you let the blood out, he'll cook faster.
No!
No!
No!
Get away from him!
?
Help!
Help!
Help!
Zhao!
Zhao!
Hey, since it seems we're in trouble every 20 minutes, maybe it could be good if you showed me a few moves.
Just in case.
Martial arts, take many years to learn.
No, I'm not asking for the whole menu.
Just a little something.
Martial arts, do not work with little something.
Well then a lot, of somethin', anything.
Even if I can do one thing to help out the next time we're in a situation.
Just give me somethin' so I have a fighting chance.
Please.
Come on.
Come on.
Get up.
Stand feet apart.
Oh, this is cool.
Bend your knees.
Sorry.
Okay.
Now imagine, there's a big tree in front of you.
Do you see it?
Yeah.
Is it big?
Yeah.
Okay.
Now, hug it.
Do what?
I mean hug the tree.
Good.
- That's it?
- That's it.
Well, how long do I have to stay like this?
You know if you're not gonna teach me, you should just say so.
I am teaching you.
Yeah, right, thanks.
Thanks a lot.
Hey.
Hey, wait.
What are you doing?
Come on.
Now, pay attention.
The secret, of all martial arts, is the circle.
When you move, the circle moves with you.
Here, let me show you.
Hit me.
Hit me again.
Again.
To understand the circle, you must make the circle...
Live the circle, until the circle is you...
And you are the circle.
Understand?
We move the moment she says "I do".
First on me.
Directly for the capital.
Second army.
To the ocean.
And the third army?
- We have a third army?
- Yes.
Just let them rob and pillage.
Excuse me, Sire.
For the wedding canopy, red or blue?
Red or blue, my love?
Oops.
And this, is called not good.
Why, it's beautiful?
Yes it is, but the fortress is over there.
And it could take days to walk all the way around the lake.
Or we could just swim across, in no time.
No, Jack.
It's not possible.
Why are there, man-eating fish in there?
No.
- Poisonous snakes?
- Nope.
- Dragons?
- Not this time of year.
So, what's in there that's a problem?
I, cannot swim.
You're kidding me?
You, who can kick the butts of the entire NFL at the same time...
And you can't swim, what's wrong with this picture?
They never taught...
- Yeah.
Oh, come on.
Where you're going?
- There's no time to waste.
- You're gonna walk?
- We don't have a choice.
Okay, you gotta get over this "you don't have a choice" thing, alright?
You do have a choice.
You're strong, and you're coordinated.
Alright, maybe, we can work somethin' out, okay?
I teach you to swim, you teach me more...
Deal?
Come on.
Ooh...
You can do it.
You can do it man, come on.
Trust me.
Hey, that's it.
There you go.
Now, put the shield down.
Now, hop on.
- Ooh...
- Hey.
There ya go.
- You havin' fun?
- Yeah!
I bet you didn't get too much of that, growing up the way you did.
Fun?
No.
So, whenever you can make up for that...
Maybe you can come visit me.
I'll show you around, maybe get my mom to take us to Disneyland or something.
I told you.
I can never take off from my job.
Hey man, look, you really gotta get a life.
When you're responsible for a life, you don't have a life.
Okay.
You...
You like go to school, to learn how say things like that?
Like what?
When you are responsible for a life, you don't have a life.
What's wrong with it?
Nothing's wrong with it, it's just...
Sounds smart.
It does?
Yeah, it does.
Cool.
- So, what's in Disneyland?
- A lot of princesses.
Oh.
- A Chinese one, too.
- Oh.
- Our king will win!
- Our king will win!
Get down, get down, get down!
- So, you do have a plan, right?
- I told you the plan.
- Ah, right.
Get past the army.
- Yes.
- Get past the personal guards.
- Correct.
Get past the tower guards, find the Princess.
- Get past reinforcements?
- Good.
- Kill Arun.
- Exactly.
Crown Sulin in person, save the country.
- Your learning to listen.
- Yeah.
The real questions is...
Do you have a plan, to execute, the plan?
Hmm?
Ah...
- Who will win?
- Our king will win!
Our king will win!
Good morning.
Hmm?
Great plan.
- Are we in the fortress?
- Yeah.
- Are we passed the army?
- Yeah.
Have we passed the personal guards?
Almost.
Well then, I think the plan is working.
I think the plan to get in, is working.
How about the plan to get out?
I'm working on it.
Warrior Zhao.
I'm so honored, that you've come all this way to attend my wedding.
I'm not here to attend your wedding.
I'm here to attend your funeral.
And you are?
He's the Black Knight.
I'm not the Black Knight, okay?
I'm...
I'm Jack Bronson.
Jack Bronson.
I've got good news.
And I have, bad news.
The good news is...
Tomorrow, when my bride and I are married.
We will stand, there.
And you two... will stand...
There.
Okay, what's the bad news?
As soon as, we've taken our vows... and our, new life begins...
Your life ends.
He's not bluffing, is he?
Arun doesn't do bluffs.
Even maybe he'll be feeling generous, on his wedding day, and he'll pardon us.
Arun doesn't do generous.
Okay, if he doesn't do this, and he doesn't do that, is there anything that he does do?
- Well, he rapes, murders, and pillages.
- So, in other words we're dead.
When one door closes, another one opens.
See?
Dinner, is served.
Urgh...
I was not expecting that.
It's time to eat.
Uh... excuse me?
Uh... would you mind...
You know, so we can...
Thank you.
Here.
Guys, I'm...
I'm looking for the Princess.
You know where she is?
- What now?
- Now is the time to use what I've taught you.
- I'm not ready.
- Of course, you are.
You're the Black Knight.
You have skills.
Okay, I don't...
I don't get it.
'Cause, one minute your tellin' me I'm worthless, and after a few lessons, I'm not?
It's not just me who thinks you're not worthless, Jack.
The way the Princess looks at you, she believes in you.
- She does?
- Now, go rescue her.
Go!
What's up?
Hmm?
- Oh!
- Jack!
You okay?
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah.
You came to save me.
I guess.
I knew you would.
You did?
From the very first.
- Princess!
- Zhao!
- Are you alright?
- I'm alright.
I'm sorry I came late to save you.
Okay, plan, we did it.
Um...
How do we get out of here?
- I'm working on it.
- Well you'd better work fast, they're coming.
How many?
- I...
I don't know. 25?
- I need to know exactly how many.
1, 2, 3... 4, 5, 6, 7... 8, 9, 10... 13, 14, 15... 27, 28, 29... 30!
- 30?
- 30.
- Are you sure?
- Yeah!
Hurry, hurry!
Come on men, follow me!
31!
31!
31!
26, 27, 28, 29...
How?
Don't move.
Don't move!
Don't move.
That worked.
Why do you still have this on?
I like it.
Come on.
Get on.
Go.
Are you on?
Are you on?
Get on!
Go.
Come on.
We're almost there.
Come on.
Amazing animals.
Raised each, and everyone of them, from birth.
Fed, by my hand only.
Nursed them when they were sick.
They are more loyal, than all my men.
They would die for me.
As well the two of you.
And you my dear...
By this time tomorrow, you and I will be husband and wife.
Emperor, and Empress.
Allow me, my love.
Take them away.
- What are they doing?
- Ancient custom.
Last smoke, last meal...
So you know what you missing.
Damn.
- How can you eat?
- I'm hungry.
- There gonna kill us.
- You should try.
- It's actually pretty good.
- I don't care if it the best food in the world, man.
I'm still a kid.
I have my whole life head of me.
And there's, a million things, that I'm never gonna be able to do.
Like what?
Dude, I never even kissed a girl.
Me neither.
You know I was that close, before you came in the room.
Yeah.
That's not the point.
- With the Princess?
How close?
- That's not the point.
- What was that?
- A butterfly.
- You spoke to a butterfly?
- Apparently.
- And it understood you?
- Hopefully.
Long live the king!
Long live the king!
Long live the king!
We are gathered here today, to witness the marriage of...
Arun the cruel, the mean, the horrible, the terrible.
- The strong!
- Can we, move it along?
- Hey, I want to say thank you.
- For what?
Tryin' to turn me into a warrior.
You were warrior from the beginning, Jack.
On the inside.
It just had to be brought out.
- Yeah, a lot a good did...
- It's not over yet.
What do you mean this not over yet?
In a minute, she's gonna be married and we're gonna die.
Jack, worrying's not gonna change anything.
Just live in the moment.
No offense, but I think we ran out of moments.
Do you Arun, take Sulin in sickness and in health...
- For better and the worse?
- I do, she does.
I now pronounce you man and wife.
To make it official, you must now kiss, the bride.
- Hello.
- Wizard!
Holy, how'd you get here?
See?
It's simple.
- Now, just go save her.
- Great, um, um, how?

Come on, man.

- Come on.
There you go.
Now jump.

Sulin...
- Jack...
Are you okay?
Hold on.
- Almost there.
- But not quite.
Why are you doing this?
You're not a warrior.
Not even a grow man.
Run along, and I'll let you live.
- You run along, and I'll let you live.
- Let me think about it.
No.
I think I'll stay here.
Maybe I'll take one leg, take your other leg.
Then I'll take your arms!
I'll just kill you.
Jack!
Jack!
You're the shit.
Thanks.
Hello, Zhao.
The Empress request your present.
Okay, I'm just waiting the wizard.
Jack, if the Empress summons you, you must come at once.
- He said he'll be right back.
- It is the rule.
Or what, huh?
Get my head chopped off?
You guys and your rules, man.
So it's against the rules to smile.
- Hi.
- Hey.
Wow!
What, so I'm not gonna get my head chop off?
- There's no one here, just me.
- Okay.
I wanted to see you before you went back.
Actually, I wish I could go with you, even for one day.
You are, the Empress now, you can do whatever you want.
Because I'm the Empress I can't.
Every minute of everyday from now on, will be filled with, ministers, ambassadors, and papers to sign and decisions to make.
- No dancing.
No singing.
- No fun.
I would love, to go to the mall to eat ice cream, but...
I, I can't.
My father worked us so hard, to bring peace to the whole country.
I can't let him down.
He gave his life for our people, I owe it to him.
I understand.
But I did want to thank you, for giving me memories, that I will always treasure.
I want to give you one, that I hope you will too.
I don't think you're worthless.
I never did.
Goodbye, Jack.
He touched the Empress.
He must to die!
Hey...
Hey!
Wizard!
Wizard!

- Got it.

- I gotta go.
Here you see?
Okay.
- It's not ready yet?
Come on, hurry!
- Relax.
Jack!
So after all we've been through?
- You gotta kill me, really?
- Rules are rules.
If we do not live by them, we'll be nothing more than barbarians.
Unless we can make an exception.
- Sometimes it's good to be a little flexible, right?
- I hate you.
Here.
Thank you.
Good bye, Jack Bronson.
I will never forget you, and the lesson you taught me.
It's done.
The last missing piece of wood.
I might of learned to be flexible, but they haven't.
- Hurry up.

Come on man, get it in.
Let's go.

Not an apartment.

Yeah, you know what?
Well Mr. Chang is not getting his home foreclosed down in 90 days.
I'm sorry.
I know hes your friend and..
It's really sweet of him to give you a job and everything, but..
We don't need philosophy.

Hey!
What are you doing?
You're going to the frat party?
- Where did he go?
- Move gentleman, away!
What's your problem?
- Problem again?
- I'm in trouble still.
You should use some of your movements in your game, Jack.
Kick some butt.
This ain't the gaming world Mr. Chang, this is real world.
One's get nothing to do with the other.
- Bravery is bravery.
- Look at me.
Do I..
Do I even look like I have one awesome brave in me?
Looking and being are 2 different things, young Jack.
On this case..
Here what you see is what you get.
Well, let's see if I can get some work out of my employee.
Yeah okay.
How are thing at home?
Moms worried about money.
Real estate markets dead.
She hasn't sold anything in months.
Looks like we're gonna have to move.
Wish I could do something to help her out.
Medical app or something?
What's all this?
The new shipment from my cousin in Beijing.
Help me open it.
- Mr. Chang what's this?
- It has been in my family since..
Forever.
- You like it?
- Yeah I do.
- The dancing Princess.
- Yeah looks like she's breaking.
- You know, like..
- Oh god..
See look?
I don't think so young Jack.
She lived a long..
Long..
Time ago.
She saved a country from the barbarians.
Talk about brave, she was brave.
This little girl can kick butt big time.
Where do I put it?
- How about your house?
- What do you mean?
I mean..
A present..
- No Mr. Chang..
I can't..
I can't..
- Oh sure you can.
You watch the shop while I going on vacations.
- Oh but you already paying me for that.
- Bad manners to refuse a gift.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- Hey so I have an idea.
- What?
This house..
Really kinda too big for both of us.
I mean when dad was here it was fine.
But now..
You know..
Maybe we should think about renting our room hall.
To that some kid from university or something.
What did I do to deserve a kid like you?
On the lottery?
Night.
- Where is the black knight?
- What?
Hey!
Where is the black knight?
- I..
I'm the black knight.
- You lie!
You die!
Black knight, it's octo man.
- Hey wait, wait.
- I'll challenge you to a duel to death.
It is a video game!
It's a video game!
Okay?
I just..
I just want to show you man.
I'm 8 arms now bro.
Okay you see that's the challenger and that's me, the black knight.
It is true..
Yeah it's me, hey look when I move..
He moves.
Fight!
You are the winner.
Just you wait man, when I'm comeback with 12 arms.
- So you are the black knight.
- In the game world, I'm the black knight.
In this world I'm Jack Bronson.
Jack Bronson worthless to me.
But I don't have a choice.
Jack Bronson, I need your help.
For what?
I need you to guard the most precious treasure of the empire.
Excuse me?
Your majesty, you can go out.
The Princess and future empress.
Hi, I'm Jack.
Anyone who touches the Princess dies.
That is the rule.
No exceptions?
There's no point in having rule if you have exception.
Sometimes is good to be a little flexible.
It's useless.
But I don't have a choice.
I'll be back as soon as possible.
If anything happens to her..
I'm hallucinating, this is crazy, this isn't happening, this isn't happening.
- Where are your-weapons?
- My weapons?
Warrior zhao said you were going to protect me.
To protect me you need to have skills and weapons.
Hey you know, I..
I think warrior zhao a little confuse because..
I'm not the black knight.
I don't have skills or weapons.
So warrior zhao was right, you are worthless.
Okay you know what?
Can we start over?
I'm Jack..
- What do I call you?
- Your highness.
- I need a name.
- Sulin.
- Okay.
- I'm hungry Jack.
Bring be swallow nest soup.
Roasted snail, the big kind.
Oh and duck tongue in hot chilli sauce.
Let's see what I can do.
Not bad.
Su lin?
No, no, no, no.
Hey, just in time.
Hey, how's your sleep?
Great, how did your sleep?
Good.
- Do want to sit down?
- Umm, no, no.
Because I read that it's better for your digestion if you're standing.
I never heard it.
Okay, I'll do the dishes.
No, no, I'll do it mom, I do it mom, I'll do dishes today.
Excuse me, what?
You have to go to work, the bridge's down, this traffic, you can be late.
- The bridge?
- Yeah.
No, you gotta go, you're gonna be late.
- Okay I need my keys..
- Got it, please... ok.
Hey, I am gonna go see aunt Sophie tomorrow, do you wanna come with?
Oh no, I gotta a lot stuff to do, like homework.
Yeah, bye bye.
Okay, you gotta come inside.
Hey, I am not joking.
God!
Ok, stay here, don't move.
Whaddup, man?

So, how do you like my octopus, bro?
Lame.
Damn, it's a prototype, yo, just gimme some time.
- I'll be killing it 8 arms and shit.
- Hello.
Hello?
You gonna intro me, bro?
- This is Hector.
- Octoman, yo.
Octoman, this is your highness.
- Really?

- Yeah, that's it.
Well, pound it up, your highness.
No!
Oh dude, I am so sorry.
I am sorry, you ok?
Yeah, it's cool man, I kinda worry, you know.
So what's the story here?
It's complicated, I don't really want talk about it right now.
- You know what I mean.
- Dude, the girl is hot.
- You're gonna hook up?
- No, if you keep ask..
Me stupid questions like that.
You tell me all about that, right?
- Until the last detail.
- Right, catch you two lovebirds later.
You can't do that!
- He want to hit me.
- No, he want to fist bump you!
It's a greeting like a handshake.
Didn't you hear warrior zhao?
No one can touch a Princess, you get your heap chopped off.
- That's the rule.
- Ok, maybe where you come from..
That's the rule, but here, here the rules are different.
When you go back to your world, you can chop off as many heads as you want, I promise.
But here, my world my rule, ok?
Ok.
No!
- What are you doing?
- Observing your world, so I can learn the rules better.
No, no, no, you have to go back inside.
How am I gonna to learn rules of your world if I don't see it?
Well you can go out dressed like that.
- Why not?
- Because..
Because, they will stare and wonder what the hell is going on.
If I were dressed differently could I stand here?
- Yes.
- Then call the tailor and have him..
- Make me new cloth.
- We don't get our clothes from the tailor.
Then take me where you do.
This for man.
- You okay?
- What's that?
- That's ice cream, it's food.
- What that feels like?
Well, it's cold and sweet.
I want one.
Ok what flavor do you want?
They have chocolate, vanilla, strawberry, cherry and mint..
Umm, I want all of them.
All of them?
Ok.
Ok.
- Girl, you're the shit.
- Hey hey, it's your ice cream.
- Yeah, we gotta go.
- That was fun.
- Yeah, really?
- I like them all, Jack, thank you for bringing me here.
You're welcome.
What do you mean I'm the shit?
When you really like something, that's what we say.
Hey mom.
- Hello.
- I ate ice cream.
Yeah, I can see that.
Mom, I forget to tell you.
Yesterday in school they asked someone to volunteer..
To take an exchange student, and...
- Sulin showed up today.
- Oh you fresh out of the boat.
No boat, I came by box.
- What?
- Oh she meant plane.
Plane, because box and plane are the same in her language.
What's the plane?
- She does it all the time.
- I thought she just gotten here.
- She did.
- But you just said all the time.
I did, I meant that in the time she's been here.
- Are you ok with this?
- Yeah, I mean..
- No, no, no.
- Sulin, it's so nice to meet you.
I am Jack's mom, I am Annie.
I am so hungry.
I am sure we have salad, fresh corn and..
Hamburger.
Sulin do you like hamburgers?
I like snails, like Jack and me last night.
Last night?
The Chinese grammar, they get their past and future tenses mixed up a lot.
You know you're acting very weird.
Why don't you put the burgers on?
Su lin and I will go make up the couch and the guess room for her.
I'm gonna be gone tomorrow but maybe when I get back we can get to know each other little better?
Maybe we can go to the mall, it's the shit.
- Who told you that?
- Jack.
Umm, this is where you gonna be sleeping.
- She said that?
- To my mom.
- That is ill dude.
- Hector, give me a break.
I don't know, man, the girl is hot.
Things I would do to her..
Good night Hector.
Excuse me, the bed next door is in the wrong position.
Very bad feng shui, I can't sleep.
This one good feng shui.
Don't forget to clean the house.
Oh don't worry, you won't recognize the place when get back.
- Say hi to aunt Sophie.
- Sure.
- Where is she?
- Who the hell are you?
- Where is the Princess?
- Listen man, I don't know, ok?
I am here.
No, no, no!
Jack!
Jack!
Jack!
Jack!
Jack!
Jack!
Ok, I told you not to let her outta of your sight.
- You worthless!
- I am not a warrior!
I don't know what you're expecting.
I was expecting more.
Ok, well how about this for more, when I saw she was taken by those..
Whatever the hell those I jumped in and after them, man, ok?
What more do you want?
And by the way, we came the same way seconds apart, she should be here.
- She's not.
- Well where is she then?
- I don't know.
- How you could not know?
I was right behind her.
I was busy!
Maybe she came in and ran out.
She probably outside.
Wait, don't!
Oops.
Ok, ok.
I don't want you to think I am backing out on you, but it's not, you know, I got a lot of homework to do..
So I should getting back by now, just go back to where I came.
It's not gonna happen.
So I am stuck here, there's no other way out?
I didn't say that.
- I am not in charge of transportation.
- Well who is?
- The wizard it is.
- And where's the wizard?
Jack Bronson, I won't do that.
- Wake up!
- Stop!
Never wake a sleeping wizard.
What?
I'll get my head chopped off?
Yes, how did you know?
Lucky guess.
What is it with you people chopping off heads?
I mean, really.
It's effective.
Close the door!
Cut the rope!
Get behind me!
Open the door.
There's like thousands of..
Just open it.
Ok.
Sorry.
Hello, what is your name, young man?
- Jack.
- Oh Jack, welcome Jack.
Is something wrong?
No, you just look a lot like someone I know.
Is he handsome?
Yes.
Ok, now let's go find the Princess.
- Can you explain something to me?
- If I can.
- Well let's start with the chest.
- The warrior's gate.
- That's the real name.
- And how does it work?
That's complicated.
It has to do with times, spaces, magic..
And things beyond explaining.
The main thing is that it's works.
- Then how do I get back.
- Another chest.
There's another chest?
Great, where is it?
Well, that is complicated.
I have to collect four different woods..
From 4 different trees that grow in four different parts of the country.
North where zippa wood is found.
South where the spotted bamboo grows.
East where the black mahogany lives.
And west where the rarest tree in all the land is found.
That's the only way to build a new box.
But first let's find the Princess.
You know where she is?
Another complicated question.
How about an easy one, huh?
Zhao.
Tell me about zhao.
That's easy.
Warrior zhao was one of the seven companions..
Raised from birth by the sacred monks..
For one thing and one thing only.
To protect the emperor.
The monks train the 7 companions day and night, year in and year out, until they would be most invincible force.
It was their sole purpose in life to protect the emperor..
While brought peace to the land.
There was not a man alive who could defeat them.
Except one.
Arun the cruel, king of barbarians.
As fate would have it.
Zhao was on the mission and they figure it out.
The food has been poisoned.
Feeling the worse.
He rush to protect the emperor.
But he arrived too late.
And then chaos descended from the north.
And the peace that emperor had work so hard to built began to fall apart.
With no leader the army was lost.
The people were lost.
The zhao fought relentlessly but as great as warrior as he was.
He needed a help of the greatest warrior that could be found.
And so, by using the cynic stone.
I found you.
Yes.
And we pass through the warriors gate to get help protecting the greatest treasure we possessed.
- Shuman?
- Sulin.
The only one who can rally the people to defeat.
The barbarians and save our kingdoms.
But I'm not be able to help him.
He thinks I am worthless.
Oh, you seems might.
But I don't.
- Based on what?
- You're here.
You didn't have to be.
You could've stay at home.
That's something about who you are.
Am I crazy?
And now if you will excuse me.
I have a lot of wood to collect.
See you.
Bye-bye.
Come on, let's go.
You know the old saying about blaming the burial is bad news.
Yes, your highness.
- You believe it's true?
- I hope not, your highness.
Good news, you're getting marry.
Bad news.
Warrior zhao is on his way.
Kill him.
Brutus, not him, kill zhao.
Ups.
- So, I assumed you have a plan.
- I do.
Save the Princess.
Prevent the married.
Oh?
She is getting married?
Force to.
Unless we stop it.
- Ah..
Who is the groom?
- Arun the cruel.
Ah, is it his name?
His full name is arum the cruel, the horrible, the terrible, the miserable.
But we keep it short.
If the marry takes place..
Once she become empress, he become emperor.
And once he is an emperor.
He will kill her and the whole country is doom.
Are you finish with dinner?
- I guess.
- Yeah, we sleep.
I know, I know, we are rafting it but do we have any, blankets and pillows?
Blankets?
No.
Pillows.
Yes.
Good night.
Let say you have rescue the Princess.
- Is she have anyone else might to marry?
- Not yet.
Any idea what kind husband she looking for?
Cause in the little time we spend together, you know what?
I thought we have something.
You know, connection.
Cause we like the same clothes, we like the same musics.
- You know, you don't think that..
- No, I don't think, Jack Bronson.
She's looking for someone good, someone brave, a hero.
Yeah.
Seized in the right of capital of chunghai province.
1.600 bricks of silver, 18.000 bricks of gold. 6 chests of diamonds.
And 26 slaves.
- Only 26 slaves?
- Yes, I know.
We're under performing in that department.
Who is in charge of slaves?
My cousin.
Get rid of him.
Brutus, I mean the cousin.
Not him!
Ups.
A second moment here, big fella.
Now, I know you want to please me, but next time..
Before you kill someone.
Should we have a signal, maybe?
Like, something like that?
Like, signal?
Like that?
A signal like that?
- Like that?
Yes.
- Kill.
That's the signal.
- Yes.
- That's the signal.
Your highness.
- Get her down.
- Finally.
Beautiful bride has arrive.
Hello, my love.
How are you?
Tired from your long trip.
- Need a hot bath?
- Stay there!
- A hunk of milk, maybe?
- Hold!
Soon, my love.
Soon.
You and me.
Let's move!
You and me!
- Go!
Go!
- Call the tailor for fitting!
- What are you doing?
- It's gonna rain.
There's no cloud.
Not all rain come from cloud.
Oh my god!
Oh my god!
Look at this!
What the hell is going on?
He wants me dead.
- So they know we are here?
- They know we're somewhere around here.
So they're just keep shooting arrows everywhere and hope to get lucky.
We called it the morning shower.
Why don't you wake me up?
I could been dead.
If I want you dead, I will do it myself.
You have to learn to listen.
- What is said?
- Do not enter.
- And what's in there?
- The unknown land.
- What is in the unknown land?
- Unknown things.
Okay, wait, but..
You are drop me off to the wizard, right?
- Wrong.
- Okay, look, I really think..
Is about time we thought about getting me home?
- So do I. Here.
- What is this?
A map.
It will take you to the wizard.
I..
I can't read this.
I just want to go home and you are not helping.
- I gave you a map.
- So basically it's screw you, Jack.
I brought you here against your will, I kidnapped you, and now you're not the person I though you were.
So, adios amigo.
You are not my problem.
Wrong at number one.
I did not kidnap you.
No one need you jump into that chest.
Right on number two.
You are not my problem.
My problem is to get through the unknown land.
Get pass the arum's army.
Pass his personal guards.
Pass the terror guards.
Find the Princess, get pass the tower's reinforcement.
Pass the personal guard's reinforcement.
Kill arum.
And then bring the Princess back so she can be made empress who save the country.
That is my problem.
So you're saying I don't have a choice.
You do have a choice.
You can save yourself or you can save her.
- I can't save a Princess!
- You are the black knight.
- Oh, yeah, I almost forgot.
- Sir, sir..
Sir..
Good news.
Don't be nervous.
It's been my lucky days so far.
- And I've good feeling about this one.
- Yes, sire.
I'm sure, it's good news.
Bad news.
- No, impossible..
- No sign of warrior zhao.
Sire... sire..
Brutus..
No, no..
- Signal, you remember, the signal?
- Signal?
- Kill him!
- No, no, no, no!
Sire!
Sire!
I was thinking.
This arum dude, maybe if he gets what he want, he'll change, you know.
Be like arum the kind?
Do you have people in your world who get what they want by threating to do bad things?
At least there is one kid.
And you give him what he wants.
Does he change?
Not really.
Might does not make right, Jack.
Right makes right.
If you don't stand up for what is right, and why you stand up at all?
You know, that's easy to say.

Invisible woman.
How is the priest people in place boxes and time travel, and none of us are weird, is it?
It's not weird.
It just magic.
We don't have magic.
Then how you do explain what cannot be explain?
We have sains.
Sains is everything.
- Does sains explain rainbow or snowflakes?
- Yes.
But does it explain how you feel when you see the rainbow or snowflake?
- No.
Feeling aren't magic.
- So you do have magic.
- What are they then?
- I don't know.
The feeling.
Okay, they make you do and say things you normally wouldn't do or say, like, like..
If you met this girl that you never knew.
And all the sudden there's..
Can't think anything to say but you can't stop talking.
And your body like hot and cold in the same time and...
Your heart is beating like you just run a mile in a minute... and it's..
It's like..
Magic?
Yeah, I guess.
Help!
Help!
Are you okay?

No!
No!
No!
Get away from him!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Zhao!
Hey, since it seems we're in trouble every 20 minutes...
Maybe it could be good if you showed me a few moves.
Just in case.
Martial arts take many years to learn.
No, I'm not asking for the whole menu.
Just a little something.
Martial arts do notwork with a little something.
Well then, a lot of something.
Anything.
Even if I can do one thing to help out the next time we're in a situation.
Just give me something so I have a fighting chance.
Please.
Come on.
Come on.
Get up.
Stand a feet apart.
Oh, this is cool.
Bend your knees.
Sorry.
Okay.
Now imagine... there's a big tree in front of you.
Do you see it?
Yeah.
Is it big?
Yeah.
Okay.
Now, hug it.
Do what?
I mean hug the tree.
Good.
- That's it?
- That's it.
Well, how long do I have to stay like this?
You know if you're not gonna teach me, you should just say so.
I am teaching you.
Yeah.
Right.
Thanks.
Thanks a lot.
Hey.
Hey, wait.
What are you doing?
Come on.
Now, pay attention.
The secret of all martial arts is the circle.
When you moved, the circle moves with you.
Here, let me show you.
Hit me.
Hit me again.
Again.
To understand the circle, you must make the circle...
Live the circle, now, the circle is you..
And you are the circle.
Understand?
We move the moment she says "I do".
First on me.
Directly for the capital.
Second army.
To the ocean.
And the third army?
We have a third army?
Yes.
Just let them robbing village.
Excuse me, sir.
For the wedding canopy.
Red or blue?
Red or blue, my love?
Oops.
And this is called not good.
Why, it's beautiful?
Yes, it is.
But the fortress is over there.
And it could take days to walk all the way around the lake.
Or we could just swim across in no time.
No, Jack.
It's not possible.
Why, are there man-eating fish in there?
No.
- Poisonous snakes?
- Nope.
- Dragons?
- Not this time of year.
So, what's in it that's a problem?
I cannot swim.
You kidding me?
You... you who can kick the butts of the entire NFL at the same time...
And you can't swim, what's wrong with this picture?
They never taught...
Yeah.
Oh, come on.
Where you're going?
There's no time to waste.
You're gonna walk?
We don't have a choice.
Okay, you gotta get over this "you don't have a choice" thing, alright?
You do have a choice.
You're strong and you're coordinated.
Alright, maybe, we can work something else, okay?
I teach you to swim, you teach me more...
Deal?
Come on.
Ooh...
You can do it.
You can do it, come on.
Trust me.
Hey, that's it.
There you go.
Now, put the shield on.
Now, hop on.
- Ooh...
- Hey.
There you go.
You having fun?
Yeah.
I bet you didn't get too much of that, growing up the way you did.
Fun?
No.
So, if you can make up for that...
Maybe you can come visit me.
I'll show you around, maybe get my mom to take us to Disneyland or something.
I told you.
I can never take off from my job.
Hey, man, look... you... you really got to get a life.
When you're responsible for a life, you don't have a life.
Okay.
You...
You like go to school to learn how say things like that?
Like what?
When you're responsible for a life, you don't have a life.
What's wrong with it?
Nothing is wrong, but that, it's just...
Sound smart.
It does?
Yeah, it does.
Cool.
So, what's in Disneyland?
A lot of princesses.
Oh.
- A Chinese one, too.
- Oh.
- Our king will win!
- Our king will win!
Get down, get down, get down!
So, you... you do have a plan, right?
I've told you the plan.
Ah, right.
Get past the army.
- Yes.
- Get past the personal guards.
- Correct.
- Get past the tower guards.
Find the Princess.
- Get past reinforcements?
- Good.
- Kill arun.
- Exactly.
Crowned sulin in person saved the country.
You learning to listen.
Yeah.
The real questions is...
Do you have a plan to execute...
The plan?
Hmm?
Ah, I mean...
- Who will win?
- Our king will win!
Our king will win!
Good morning.
Hmm?
Great plan.
- Are we in the fortress?
- Yeah.
- Are we passed the army?
- Yeah.
Have we passed the personal guards?
Almost.
Well then, I think the plan is working.
I think the plan to get in is working.
How about the plan to get out?
I'm working on it.
Warrior zhao.
I'm so honored, that you've come all this way to attend my wedding.
I'm not here to attend your wedding.
I'm here to attend your funeral.
And you are?
He's the black knight.
I'm not the black knight, okay?
I'm...
I'm Jack Bronson.
Jack Bronson.
I've got good news.
And I have bad news.
The good news is...
Tomorrow... when my bride and I are married.
We will stand... there.
And you two... will stand...
There.
Okay, what's the bad news?
As soon as we've taken our vows...
You know, new life begins...
Your life ends.
He's not bluffing, is he?
Arun doesn't do bluffs.
Even maybe he'll be feeling generous 'cause it his wedding day, and he'll pardon us.
Arun doesn't do generous.
Okay, if he doesn't do this and he doesn't do that...
Is there anything that he does do?
Well, he rapes, murders, and pillagers.
I guess in another words we're dead.
When one door closes, another one opens.
See?
Dinner is served.
Urgh...
I was not expecting that.
It's time to eat.
Uh... excuse me?
Uh... would you mind...
You know, so we can...
Thank you.
Here.
Guys, I'm..
I'm looking for the Princess.
You know where she is?
What now?
Now is the time to use what I've taught you.
I'm not ready.
Of course, you are.
You're the black knight.
You have skills.
Okay, I don't...
I don't get it.
'Cause, one minute you told me I'm worthless, and after a few lessons, I'm not?
It's not just me who thinks you're not worthless, Jack.
The way the Princess looks at you..
She believes in you.
- She does?
- Now, go rescue her.
Go!
What's up?
Hmm?
- Jack!
Jack!
- Oh!
You okay?
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah.
You came to save me.
I guess.
I knew you will.
You did?
From the very first.
Princess!
Zhao.
- Are you alright?
- I'm alright.
I'm sorry I came late to save you.
Okay, plan, we did it.
Um...
How do we get out of here?
I'm working on it.
You better work fast, they're coming.
How many?
I...
I don't know. 25?
I need to know exactly how many.
1, 2, 3... 4, 5, 6, 7... 8, 9, 10... 13, 14, 15... 27, 28, 29... 30!
30?
30.
Are you sure?
Yeah!
Hurry!
Follow me!
Follow me!
31!
31!
31!
26, 27, 28, 29...
How?
Don't move.
Don't move!
Don't move.
That worked.
Why do you still have this on?
I like it.
Come on.
Get on.
Go.
Are you on?
Are you on?
Get on!
Go.
Come on.
We almost there.
Come on.
Amazing animals.
Raise each and everyone of them from birth.
I've fed them by hand.
Nurse them when they were sick.
They are more loyal than all my men.
They would die for me.
As well the two of you.
And you my dear..
By this time tomorrow, you and I will be husband and wife.
Emperor and empress.
Allow me, my love.
Take them away.
- What are they doing?
- Ancient custom.
Last smoke, last meal..
So you know what you missing.
Damn.
- How can you eat?
- I'm hungry.
- They gonna kill us.
- You should try.
- It's actually pretty good.
- I don't care if it the best food in the world, man.
I'm still a kid.
And my whole life head to me.
There's a million things I'm never gonna be able to do.
Like what?
Dude, I never been kiss a girl.
Me neither.
You know, I was that close before you came to the room.
Yeah.
That's not the point.
- With the Princess?
How close?
- That's not the point.
- What was that?
- A butterfly.
- You spoke to the butterfly?
- Apparently.
- Are they understood you?
- Hopefully.
Long live the king!
Long live the king!
Long live the king!
We are gather at here today to witness the marriage of..
Arun the cruel, the ruin, the horrible, the terrible.
- The strong!
- Can we move it along?
- Hey, I want to say thank you.
- For what?
Try to turn me to be warrior.
You were warrior from the beginning, Jack.
On the inside.
It just had to be brought out.
- Yeah, a lot a good did..
- It's not over yet.
What do you mean this not over yet?
In the minute, she's gonna be marriage and we'll die.
Jack, worrying it's not gonna change anything.
Just live in the moment.
No offense, but I think we don't have a moment.
Do you arun take su lin in sickness and in health..
- For better and the worse?
- I do, she does.
And goes to be my wife.
To make it official, you must now kiss the bridge.
- Hello.
- Wizard!
How can you get here?
See?
It's simple.
- Now just go safe her.
- Wait, wait, how?
- Jump.
- Jump?
Come on, man.
- There's another jump powder.
- Come on.
- There you go.
Now jump.
- Jump how?
What do you mean now, this powder hasn't do specific.
- You can do it, Jack.
- Jump!
Okay.
Come on.
That way!
Su lin.
Whoa, would you stop that, please.
It's totally buzz kill.
Now, come on.
Let's go.
Get back!
Jack.
Here.
- Hey, hey, wait, wait, I don't know how to do this.
- Just throw.
Thanks.
Go save the Princess!
Come on, let's go.
Come on!
Hurry.
Come on, Jack.
Watch out!
It's time to go.
Su lin.
Su lin.
- Su lin.
Su lin..
- Jack..
Are you okay?
Hold on.
- Almost there.
- But not quite.
Why you doing this, son?
You're not a warrior.
Not even a grow man.
Leave her alone and I let you live.
- You leave her alone, and I let you live.
- Let me think about it.
No.
I think I'll stay here.
And I will take one leg.
Your other leg.
Now take your arm.
I'll just kill you.
Jack!
Jack!
You're the shit.
Thanks.
Hello, zhao.
The empress request your present.
Okay, I'm just waiting the wizard.
Jack, if the empress summon you, you must come at once.
- He said he'll be right back.
- It is the rule.
Or what, huh?
Get my head chop off?
You guys and your rules, man.
So I guess it's the rules to smile.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Wow.
What?
Sure I'm not gonna have my head chop off?
- There's no one here to see.
- Okay.
I wanted to see you before you went back.
Actually I wish I could go with you.
- Even for one day.
- You are the empress now.
You can do whatever you want.
Because I'm the empress I can't.
Every minutes of everyday from now on will be filled with.
Ministers, ambassadors, and paper to signing, decision to make.
- No dancing.
No singing.
- No fun.
I would love to go to the mall to eat ice cream, but..
I..
I can't.
My father worked so hard to bring peace to the whole country.
I can't let him down.
He gave his life for our people I owe it to him.
I understand.
But I did want to thank you for giving me memories that I will always treasured.
I want to give one that I hope you will, too.
I don't think you're worthless.
I never did.
Goodbye, Jack.
He touched the empress.
He must to die!
Hey..
Hey!
Wizard!
Wizard!
- I'm here.
Got it.
- I gotta go.
No I gotta go now.
I gotta go now.
- Hey, I know.
I put it somewhere.
- I gotta go.
Here you see?
Okay.
- It's not ready yet?
Come on, hurry!
- Relax.
Jack!
So after all we've been through?
- You gotta kill me, really?
- Rules are rules.
If we do not live by them, we'll be nothing more than barbarians.
Unless we can make an exception.
- Sometimes good to be a little flexible, right?
- I hate you.
Here.
Thank you.
Good bye, Jack Bronson.
I will never forget you and the lesson you taught me.
It's done.
The last missing piece to put.
I might learned to be flexible but they haven't.
- Hurry up.
Let's go.
- Yes.
- Come on, man.
Get it in.
- Let's go.
- Go..
Go!
- Come on!
Jack?
Hi, mom.
What happened here?
It's complicated.
I'm sure it is.
Hello, dick-wad.
Come on, Travis I'm gonna be late for the class.
You're gonna be late..
Permanently.
- Okay, it's doesn't have to be this way.
- You're right.
It doesn't.
- You could..
Run.
- Yeah, nice.
Pussy.
Okay.
I gave you the option.
You gave me the option?
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
You wanna dance?
Just give this over with.
- Oh, man.
- Dick-wad.
Asshole!
- You're done?
- You're dead!
Don't touch me!
You had enough?
- You alright?
- You alright, man?
Yo, come on, man.
Come on, man.
- Come on, get up.
- Don't touch me!
Get up.
Anvil center.
What you doing?
Sweetie, we have to move.
I..
I can't make the payment.
We're losing the house.
Or not.
Um.
It's a cheque?
- Yeah.
- Its $25,000?
Yeah.
- It's made out to you?
- Yeah.
I don't understand.
Well, I, um..
I came up the idea for a game and I sold it.
Oh, you're kidding.
No.
Oh, my god.
I'm sorry.
I have to sit down.
A video game?
What it is called?
Uh, the warriors gate.
What?
Sulin wins.
I'll have the chocolate cone, please.
Uh, I'll have chocolate, too and vanilla and cherry and strawberry.
Hi.
- What..
What are you..
- Doing here?
I've made a new rule.
Everyone takes a vacation even the empress.
Very modern, huh?
- Wait, how did you..
Yeah.
- Get here?
I had the wizard making out a box.
Oh, this is..
This is so awesome.

aLDEN@Symbianize !
The Warriors Gate
We've got a webpage which people are accessing via the darknet.
Two killers, different murder styles.
One person is posting a target for the other and the other is committing the murder.
They're playing a game.
We are arresting you for the possession and distribution of indecent images of a minor.
Please, Ruth.
Surely we can sort this out.
I don't think you should be anywhere near this house.
Why are people doing this to me?
I've done nothing wrong.
Jenna Mawson's in danger and we don't know that Kenny isn't involved.
Hello?
Police.
- Mitch?
Leave us alone!
- I have an officer down.
I'm struggling being here, knowing that the guy who killed Mitch is in this building and I'm doing nothing about it.
There's still someone out there killing.
- I think I recognise him.
I think it was the witness at Michael Edgerton's murder.
The one who gave us Steve's description.
He's started to pick his own victims.
The officer Ian Mitchell was murdered whilst attending a house in Gorton.
It was there that he lost his life after suffering a knife attack.
Questions are now being asked as to why officers were sent to such a dangerous situation so woefully ill-prepared.
DC Ian Mitchell is survived by a wife and two children.
The family have asked to...
DS Janet Scott is being hailed as a hero.
It's believed she prevented the death of a seven-year-old child, whilst reportedly trying to save her colleague, DC Mitchell's life.
All at a time when Manchester Metropolitan Police are coming under increasing pressure over their handling of a series of murders connected to a gang of killers currently stalking the streets of Manchester.
Sorry.
- Jesus!
Sorry.
Tim Canton.
I'm a freelance journalist.
Really sorry.
You shouldn't be here.
You need to speak to the press office.
It sounds like you did something amazing yesterday.
- I'm sorry.
Maybe you'd be happier talking about your daughter Taisie?
Arrested for distributing indecent images of children?
I just need a story.
- Drive, please.
I don't care which one it is.
We found where the sandwich wrapper from Steve Dench's car came from.
It's a small chain of eight convenience stores.
So he stopped at one of them on the morning of Edgerton's murder.
Yes.
He could've disposed of the gloves or the hoodie he wore when he killed Michael there.
And the murder weapon.
Get onto the shops, check the barcodes and see which one he stopped at.
Does he know the shopkeeper?
Is that where he accessed the website?
Cos if we can find out how he did that, and get his encryption codes, we don't just get him for Edgerton's murder but we find out who he's playing this sick game with.
On it.
Mitch's brother's been in touch to confirm the date of the funeral.
It's a week tomorrow.
We'll try to allow as many people as possible to attend.
We all need to be there.
- Pete, you will absolutely be there, but as we've got a critical situation still live... still active, then there'll have to be a ballot draw for the rest of us.
Didn't take you long, did it?
Looking to make this role more permanent, are we?
Briefing in ten.
A word.
You daft cow.
You daft cow... that's three words, not one.
Are you about to tell me off?
Please don't say you're about to tell me off.
Then please don't tell me you went round to Sam's mum's and asked her to drop the charges.
She's made a complaint to the Serious Sexual Offences Unit.
They've asked me to offer you some "management advice".
I really don't want to say this but I have to.
If you take any more steps to get Ruth or Sam to change their statements, you'll be subject to a disciplinary investigation.
- How am I guilty now?
Why aren't they trying to help us?
Certainly gives you a different perspective being on the other side.
You know that you're going a little bit bad-ass crackers, don't you?
Carry on like this and you and Taisie'll be occupying a family room at Holloway Prison.
This isn't you, Janet.
You've always taught me that we have to be by-the-book perfect.
It's the only way that we can do this job and survive.
Yeah, and over the years you've taught me that sometimes that isn't enough.
Face shots of our new suspect at the neo-Nazi rally will be checked through VIPER.
We need to show these to Jenna Mawson.
She's the only person that's been nominated and survived.
She may be able to identify him.
We didn't get a clear shot of the person who murdered Lukasz Balusek by the canal, but we got footage of them walking together.
Is it possible to use gait analysis.... matching how he walks... to prove it's the same bloke?
Yeah, maybe.
But we haven't managed to pick this guy up entering the city on the day of the neo-Nazi rally.
And our trail runs cold on Lever Street, as he leaves the murder scene.
There's loads of car parks in the Northern Quarter.
They'll be covered with cameras.
Good, get onto it.
What if we didn't miss his exit from the city centre because he didn't leave?
Because he lives or works there?
Pete, Anna, I want you to take an image as discreetly as possible round the shops and bars of the Northern Quarter, see if anyone can give this guy a name.
- Why not put out a full media alert?
The last thing I want is him going to ground before we've exhausted every other avenue of enquiry.
Should we alert the public?
We're talking about a serial killer who is going to kill again.
The investigation has definitely accelerated the frequency of the attacks.
The first murders were months, years apart.
We've had two in the last week.
It's highly likely he will attack again, and soon.
All the more reason to keep our hands close to our chest.
They'd have spent months preparing those early murders, tracking their victims, making sure every little detail was in place.
Right now they're lashing out, they're ill-prepared, getting sloppy, making mistakes and that is how we're going to catch them.
So this is the same guy who led us to Steve Dench?
Yes, it's definitely the man that gave me the statement at Michael Edgerton's murder.
And now he's a suspect?
Then why give us a witness statement?
- He's trying to frame Steve Dench?
So that makes Steve Dench innocent?
Not necessarily.
This is a game with two people involved.
Maybe this guy just got sick of playing with Steve.
If Steve's guilty.
I wouldn't be surprised if he'd set up other websites, grooming other people to play the game.
Steve's no longer necessary.
- But surely by leading us to Steve, he's risking getting caught himself.
He's already shown his face to Anna.
He'd love that.
The cheek of it.
He wouldn't think in a million years we'd be able to catch him.
But how can he be sure Steve won't lead us to him?
Unless he knows that Steve can't because we have no evidence that these people have ever met before except on the website.
We've searched for the username Scareit4me on other websites.
We found it appearing about seven years ago on a snuff porn site, who was talking to someone called mansupermanch85.
At that point the conversations aren't encrypted.
They've nothing really to hide.
They're just commenting on images.
What we can see is one of them grooming the other, encouraging him to consider how exciting it must be to commit these murders.
Then the more dominant of the two suggests they set up their own website.
They start encrypting and we can't see what they're saying.
Let's keep the pressure up on Steve Dench.
Question his wife, Joanne, and Marion Coleman.
If he is having an affair with Marion, then his wife might not be so protective.
Marion said that she met Steve at 8am that morning.
She says she sees him most mornings at that time.
I just wanted to double check that fits with your statement that on the morning in question you saw Steve leave at 7am?
I normally hear him leave at that time.
They sleep in separate beds.
So she didn't see or hear him that morning.
So he could've left the house in time to commit Edgerton's murder?
Well, there goes his alibi.
Get him back in before Marion or Joanne can give him any information.
I'll speak to Jenna Mawson.
Do you recognise this man?
Is that one of the men after me?
We think so.
- You think?
You don't know?
- Jenna, you are safe here.
I promise you.
Have you made that promise before?
Look, here's my number.
Have you?
How many times?
Have you always managed to keep it?
There is someone outside this flat 24 hours a day.
And there is a huge amount of people out there searching for him.
And all of you still haven't been able to stop him.
I'm trapped here on my own.
He knows where I live and I don't know if the person knocking on my door is here to protect me or not.
How can you promise me that I'll be safe?
You're nowhere with this.
Do you think it's time to hand this over?
What?
No.
Why?
You're just setting out on your sergeant's career...
Do you really want to put yourself in the firing line?
I thought I had everyone's backing?
You have...
Well, you did have, but now the shit's hitting.
The top ranks are coming under a lot of pressure to get results and if they can't get them, the next best thing's a scapegoat.
You think this is your moment to shine but I think if you hold onto this it could be very damaging.
It would be more damaging to walk away and let someone else clear this mess up.
I want to see this through.
I just need you to trust me.
What?
- Come home, Rachel!
He's been here.
What are you going to do?
Challenge them to a game of rounders?
Don't you dare laugh at me!
Thank God the kids didn't see it.
Callum's at his dad's and Holly's at the Arndale.
You don't know they didn't do it.
We need to call the police.
They're here.
Not you.
The proper ones, with sniffer dogs and guns.
Oh, great.
Someone else who doesn't think I'm capable of doing my job!
Look, if you were a kid while all this was kicking off, and you knew that a copper lived down the end of the street, what would you do?
Come on.
Yeah, all right.
I'd be drawing bloody great big chalk stars on their wall, of course I would.
Someone would've been in touch if anything had been posted online and I was in danger, which they haven't, so there isn't and I'm not.
Ring someone at least.
- I don't need to.
Why don't you understand that I'm the person you ring?
My bosses already want to chuck me off the case.
How's it going to look if I dial 999 and say, "Someone's not playing down their own end, someone's drawing chalk stars on my gate".
So, no, I'm not ringing anyone.
- Do it for the baby.
Oh, and you can pack that in.
I haven't even checked to see if it's still there today.
It's like you're willing this one away so you don't have to grieve its loss.
Stop treating life like it doesn't matter.
I spend my days protecting people's lives.
Start with your own.
Worry about the rest when you know you're safe yourself.
It's OK to be scared of stuff.
Stars, babies...
If you just stop talking right now
I will call someone... as soon as you've gone.
- Where am I going?
A safehouse?
What about the kids?
They've got school.
No, back home.
Back to Tony.
I know you've been talking these last few of days.
I've heard you.
I do love him.
I do.
And he's finally admitted he's a donkey-faced tosser when he's had a drink.
- You should write Valentines cards.
Well, you're not staying here on your own tonight.
You can stay at ours.
I don't think the reconciliation would last that long if you turned up with me.
Can you stay at Janet's?
There's definitely a job going at your place?
Could you put a word in?
Great.
I'll get onto the Met's website and get an application in.
Still hanging in there, buddy.
No!
No, no, no, no!
Oh.
Urgh.
We've been trying to call you.
- Sorry.
Sorry.
I dropped my phone down the loo.
What happened?
- You've missed the chippy run.
We got you sausage and mushy peas.
The barcodes narrowed down the sandwich wrappers to two possible stores.
Neither are between Steve's house and the gym.
So we know he took a detour.
One of them is between the Michael Edgerton murder scene and the gym.
Get me CCTV from the shop on that morning and I want a POLSA search of the area around the shop.
We're looking for that black hoodie and his murder weapon.
Right.
Hey.
You all right?
Hm...
I've just had a bit of nonsense with our Alison.
Don't stop eating for me.
I had some proper weird cravings.
Steve's downstairs ready for interview.
Are you prepped?
- Um, yeah.
There's just a couple of things I wanted to run by you.
Steve might not have a connection to the canal victim, Lukasz Balusek.
But the woman he's having an affair with did.
Marion Coleman works at the university in the loans department.
She said that Balusek gave her a ton of grief when they turned down his hardship application.
We're getting closer.
Did she recognise any of the other victims?
No.
And she's not sure but she thinks she remembers telling Steve about the arguments.
So now we do have a connection.
Cafe Come Home in the Northern Quarter.
They said our suspect comes in most mornings, first thing, for a double shot of espresso.
- Name?
No, but they did say he pays using a Smart watch.
So I'm waiting for details from their payments system, see who pays that way.
Or we could just make sure we're there when he next comes in.
Did we get Steve back in before Joanne and Marion left?
Yes.
How long do you reckon his solicitor will let you speak to him before she insists on rest for the night?
I'll play it to our advantage.
I'm going to go in and say...
We've spoken to Marion Coleman and, as a result, we have new evidence pertaining to Michael Edgerton's murder.
It's very late.
And once again I'd like to direct you to the fact that my client...
Has made a written statement.
- Yes, that's fine.
And you're right, it's very late so I think that's enough for tonight.
So I drop that little bombshell, then we bed him down for the night with no-one to talk to but the voices in his head, asking those questions about what we know.
Hard ball.
That's not very you.
No, it didn't used to be.
Well, let's give it a go and see what happens.
Hi, can we speak to Taisie Scott, please?
Why are they here at this time?
They have to.
It's part of Taisie's bail conditions.
At three in the morning?
They need to make sure nobody can accuse me of getting special treatment.
Are you OK?
- Yeah.
Mum!
- Where did you get this?
Mel gave it me.
She got an upgrade.
No chance!
No phones until this is over and then you're having yoghurt cartons and a piece of string!
Papa Romeo One to Papa Romeo 39.
Covert ops are in place.
Over.
I can't take Pete seriously when he calls himself Papa Romeo One.
Papa Romeo 39 to Papa Romeo One.
Understood.
Over.
Have you got your phone fixed yet?
If your SIM'll fit, I've got a spare one you can use.
Over.
It's got rainbow stickers on it.
I'm just seeing if mine's dried out.
I've had it in the airing cupboard all night.
Over.
'Thank God the kids didn't see it.
Callum's at his dad's and Holly's at the Arndale.'
'You don't know they didn't do it.'
We've got a someone.
Papa Romeo Two.
I've got eyes on him and can confirm it's our suspect.
Over.
Papa Romeo 39.
Let's try and pick him up before he gets into that cafe.
We're arresting you on suspicion of murder.
We've got him.
- It may harm your defence...
I want co-ordinate them being in the custody area at the same time.
I want to get those first reactions of seeing each other.
See if they recognise each other or not.
If I were you I would have a word with him and explain...
Anna, you found him, so you're up.
So you were at the neo-Nazi rally?
Yes, I was there, but it's not what you think.
It's just like-minded people trying to protect our country and the people born here.
A bit like you, I guess.
OK.
Well, I was wondering if you could look at this footage for me?
I'm now showing Craig Widnes video exhibit RB12.
I'd like to draw your attention to two specific moments on the film.
I've frozen the footage at 1 hour 36 minutes.
Can you confirm that this is you?
Yes.
I think you might be right.
Brilliant.
Great.
Would you mind talking me through what you're doing?
In the first clip I'm being bounced about by some idiots.
It was getting a bit rowdy for me.
That's why I decided to leave the rally.
And in the second clip, this clip, I'm tying my shoe lace.
I'm now showing Craig Widnes photo exhibit RB16.
There was a chalk star drawn at the place where you were kneeling.
What can you tell us about it?
I've seen these in the news, but I didn't notice it when I was tying my lace.
- So you didn't draw it?
Keep the questions open-ended.
No.
I'd like to ask you about the statement you gave me on the morning of Michael Edgerton's murder.
What?
She needs to stick with the rally.
I think you must be mistaken.
We haven't met, have we?
Yes, you gave me the statement about seeing a man running away.
I don't think so.
Are you 100% positive?
Yes.
She doesn't sound so certain.
She needs to slow this down, get back on track, take control.
I really don't think so.
Did I give you my name and address?
No.
- Sign a statement?
No.
- So there's nothing to say it was definitely me?
Oh, shit.
She wasn't ready for this.
She needs to stop the interview and re-group.
It was me.
At the rally.
I admit I was there.
And I can understand why you'd be offended by that.
But my political beliefs shouldn't affect how I'm treated.
You're relying on CCTV images which are poor to say the least.
Have you identified everyone else in that footage?
Have you eliminated them from your enquiries?
"I left at 7am to drive to the gym.
I feel that the manner... ."
As I mentioned last night, we spoke to Marion Coleman and she confirmed she'd seen you at the gym, as per your written statement.
We asked her how certain she was it was you.
She was.
And she was very forthcoming about your relationship.
How would you describe your relationship with Marion Coleman?
I don't think...
- Hey.
It's just that if you are having an affair with her, it makes her a somewhat unreliable witness.
So, we wanted to be thorough, and as you're not answering questions we went back to your wife Joanne.
I explained to her why Marion is unreliable and asked her if she could give us more details about the morning in question.
What do you think she said when we explained to her about Marion?
What she said is...
That she didn't actually see you leave the house on the morning of Michael Edgerton's murder.
- OK...
- Yeah, all right.
I should've told you straight.
I left earlier and it was my car parked where you said I was.
I was meeting a bloke about buying some steroids.
That's why I never told you.
I was scared of getting in trouble.
The purchase of steroids isn't illegal.
The supply of them is, so you've no need to worry.
Can you tell me the name of the person you met?
I don't know his name.
He's a friend of a bloke at the gym.
I was just told to meet him there.
OK.
Well, can you tell me the name of the person at the gym?
Then we can check him out and hopefully eliminate you from this particular line of enquiry.
John McEnroe.
- No.
- Yeah.
First name off his lips.
You could see him crumbling as soon as he'd said it, but at least we've got him talking.
Hello.
- Your sandwich wrapper's paid off.
We've found the hoodie and the gloves.
They were dumped inside a clothes recycling unit near the convenience store.
Pretty bloody clever if you ask me.
Not as clever as he thinks he was because we still found them.
I want them fast-tracked through forensics, and I mean proper fast-tracked.
Er...
Craig Widnes' solicitor is kicking off.
He wants to speak to the PACE inspector about release.
Is there any chance you could've been wrong about him being at the crime scene?
No.
None at all?
- I'm pretty sure.
So, why is he being unduly singled out?
Have you TIE'd any of the other people from the footage?
No, because we've only just located him.
Has he co-operated?
Yes.
Sorry.
I consider it proportionate to release your client on bail...
You've got to be joking.
- .. whilst further enquiries are carried out.
The Custody Sergeant will deal with bail.
Well, I've no doubt we'll be speaking to you again very soon.
She's a charmer.
She should write Valentines cards.
'He's finally admitted that he's a donkey-faced tosser when he's had a drink.'
'You should write Valentines cards.'
'Do it for the baby.' - 'Oh, and you can pack that in.
I haven't even checked to see if it's still there today.'
Right, I've heard enough, thanks.
Um... so when I first heard it I thought I'd recorded it myself.
But after what Craig said... could he have done it somehow?
Yeah.
You've been hacked.
There was one similar last year.
Turns on your phone's microphone without you knowing.
Somebody can do that?
Yeah, it could even be activated by a dodgy text.
People sign that right away, legally, every day.
You ever read the T's and C's on all those messaging and phone apps you download?
No.
Nobody does.
When you click 'agree' you've got no idea what you're actually agreeing to.
Loads of them say they can access your information, your microphones, without you knowing.
This hack just does it without you ticking the box.
I don't like this one bit.
We need Craig picking up, soon as.
- Yep.
- Could you give us a minute?
Yesterday you begged me to trust you.
That same day you were keeping information from me that could not only jeopardise the case but put your life in danger.
I thought I'd recorded it by mistake.
- I'm not talking about the recordings.
I'm talking about the star outside your house, that you're pregnant and haven't disclosed it.
If I'd thought that the star was a credible threat, I'd have come straight to you.
That's not your call to make.
I think for the benefit of the case and for the safety of yourself and your unborn child,
I think I have no other choice than to take you off the case.
- No.
You know what this has cost.
Take me away from this and you're as good as saying I've failed.
You said, "Don't throw away your career", and you want to sign its death warrant.
No.
I'm going to London.
You can fuck Manchester and forget the baby!
And they can stick their bastard job!
- Do you want me to go?
All she said was you need to go home and calm down while she thinks about it.
- I don't need to calm down.
No, you've got Dalai Llama written all over you.
Aaarrrgghhhh!
Better?
- No.
Give me a minute.
Aaaarrgghhhh!
I hate this shitty place.
My girlfriend wants me to consider quitting as well.
I'm not quitting.
I'm escaping.
- Why?
I know!
I keep telling her, I'm a Chinese lesbian.
Lop my leg off and I'll be superintendent by the end of the year!
After Mitch's death, she's wondering if this is the right job to do.
Doing this case, I'm wondering if she might be right.
And let the blokes do all the dirty work?
You can't let them scare you away.
Have you heard her?
Have the last 20 years meant nothing?
!
Do you know what people like Gill, Dodson and me have had to put up with so you can be here, being brilliant?
We're not going to be around forever!
They're bringing Craig Widnes back in to ask him about my phone.
Dodson doesn't think I should stay at mine tonight, so... er... can I... um...?
Course.
I'm going to get my scan.
Wherever I end up, I'm going to need my MATB1 certificate.
But you've decided to have the baby?
No.
No, um...
Dodson insisted for procedure.
I've got Anna trying to find a connection between Widnes and any of the victims.
So what's your plan for Steve?
He still thinks he can talk his way out of this, but he hasn't accounted for all of his movements on the day of the murder.
So I'm going to delay disclosure regarding the hoodie.
I want to keep that back to keep him gabbing.
If forensics come back positive, the hoodie only gets us Michael Edgerton's murder.
So we need the weapon and the device Steve used to access that website if we're going to get him for the rest.
I'll have my phone on me.
Good luck.
You have one new message.
Hi, it's Jenna.
I'm going to Victoria Station.
Can you meet me there, please?
For the purposes of the recording, I'm showing Steve exhibit JB2.
What can you tell me about this man?
I don't know him.
We're investigating this man as a possible suspect in the murder cases we're talking to you about.
What would you say if I told you that it was this man's statement that brought you to our attention and led to your arrest?
I said I don't know him.
You might not recognise him, but that doesn't mean you don't know him, does it?
You might've met him online.
On social media, perhaps?
No.
I don't know.
It's our belief that the man with whom you've been plotting and committing these murders is doing his best to make sure we catch you and that you go to prison for a very long time.
What have you got to say about that?
Look, I told you, I lied, but that was only about meeting the guy with the steroids.
You said it was OK.
- John McEnroe?
- Yeah.
We couldn't find anybody with that name registered at your gym.
Well, that's what he said his name was.
He did.
Look, I don't know anything about these murders or this bloke or any websites.
OK, you should try and calm down.
Why did you just mention websites?
- Because you were asking me about the internet.
Yeah, that's right I was, but I was talking about social media.
So what are these other websites that you know nothing about?
I just meant Facebook and Twitter.
How about the website 'Taking out the Trash'?
What does that mean to you?
Nothing.
Have a little think.
Are you sure?
Yeah.
Don't you believe me?
You're looking quite distressed, Steve.
Can you tell me why that might be?
Because I feel like I'm being set-up.
- Who by?
You.
Oh, I thought you meant the man who'd given us this statement.
Yeah, him as well.
What reason do you think he might have for doing that, Steve?
How should I know?
I've never met him, this man.
I haven't talked to him on a website.
Why is he doing this to me?
As I said before, we think that you've being set-up.
We think that you've been set-up all along.
So you think I'm innocent?
- I think you've been used.
I think that you've been groomed into committing these acts and now you're being set-up to take the fall for them.
And I think that if that is the case, it's in your best interests to come clean and help us catch this man before he hurts anybody else.
Hey, Jenna.
Where are you?
Jenna!
Jenna?
Where's Jenna?
Argh!
Where's Jenna?
Uhh!
Jenna!
Uhh!
Where's Jenna?
Uhh!
Argh!
Arghhh!
Arghh!
OK, so, on the day that Michael Edgerton was murdered,
I wondered if you could talk me through the rest of your movements.
I was at work.
- How did you get to work?
I drove.
- How many cars do you have?
Just the one.
- Which way did you go?
Princess Road and then the A34.
We checked all of the ANPR for that route on that day...
It's a busy route so there's lots of cameras...
And we didn't pick up your car once.
Can you tell me why that might be?
Argh.
If you didn't drive, how did you get to work that day?
Actually I wanted to do some work on the way there so I took the bus.
The quickest bus is 56 minutes, the slowest... one hour 36 minutes.
So, how is it possible for you to get from the gym to the bus stop, catch a bus and get to work in 45 minutes?
I got a lift.
- Who with?
I'm not going to give you her name.
I'm not dragging anyone else into this.
We need to search Marion Coleman's car.
He was using it on the day of the Edgerton murder.
Yeah, do it.
According to Michael Edgerton's girlfriend,
Michael was a cleaner for Craig Widnes' property company.
Pass it on to Dodson.
Yeah.
OK, all right.
All right, cheers.
Hello.
I need a unit to Hunts Bank, Victoria Station basement now.
Rach?
Rach?
Hunts Bank, Victoria.
Get the Transport Police in that basement now.
You cannot stop this.
I can stop you.
Transport Police!
Don't move!
Stand still!
Drop your weapon.
I'm arresting you.
You don't have to say anything but it may harm your defence if you do not mention when questioned something you later rely on in court.
If you do say anything it will be given as evidence.
Do you understand?
Steve Dench was desperate not to mention Marion's car.
They found the knife and they found the phone he used with the encryption codes.
So that will give access to details of all the murders.
We stopped them.
Not soon enough.
Four months old and that hand already looks like it could hold a pint pot.
It's stuck around this long.
I reckon it's earnt its place in the bottom drawer.
I can always sell it on the darkweb if it gets on my nerves.
So you're staying in Manchester?
Yeah.
I need to teach kids like Anna that we've got every right to be here.
Besides, you oldies won't be around forever.
Less time than you think if I carry on breaking the law.
I used Taisie's phone.
I got Sam to send some new pictures.
Yeah, I know, I know.
But when I show them to the CPS, the case'll collapse.
I had to prove that Sam's not a victim.
What about your job?
We'll see.
Nobody has to know that it wasn't Taisie who texted Sam.
You've changed.
I'm turning into you.
No need to sound so upset about it.
Jan, you did what you had to do.
I shouldn't have had to.
Sometimes we don't have a choice.
I can't wait till it's born.
I might actually get my life back.
I've been gagging for a fag and a drink.
I have not been sleeping properly.
Yeah.
As soon as it's born, nothing but sleep.
You're in for a shock.
- Oh, don't sound so smug.
You're in prison if I grass you up.
I knew I shouldn't have told you.
Free babysitting for life.
You bugger.
(loud explosion)
(high-pitched ringing, muffled crying)
(muffled shouting)
(baby crying)
(muffled crying, shouting continues)
This morning's bombing in Rome is more than just a brutal attack on one of the most beautiful cities in the world.
This is a threat which will be answered.
(reporters speaking at once)
Governor, Governor, you've said that as president, you would increase surveillance of Muslim Americans...
Whoa, whoa.
First of all, no group has claimed responsibility yet for the bombing at Stazione Triumfale in Rome.
And I would never suggest infringing on the rights
- of America citizens, ever.
- (scoffs) Yeah?
He doesn't suggest it.
He wants to legislate it.
EVANS:
But if an attack does occur...
Nice suit, though.
His staff's definitely working overtime.
They've pulled him off the campaign trail so he can keep running around showing off his new global concern.
No mention of the bombing in Angola, I notice.
Twice as many dead as in Rome.
But if the press doesn't mention it, why should he?
(turns off TV)
(exhales)
Of course, this means that I have to pull Conrad off the trail, too.
Right after that China speech last week got us a two point bump in the polls.
But we still have an election to pull out of thin air.
I thought it was... less than a total long shot, which...
I took to be boundless optimism coming from you.
New York Times is about to endorse us, which should reassure the centrists.
And we are making progress getting those sore loser laws changed to get him on the ballot in the states we missed in the primaries.
I'm sensing an Eeyore footnote.
(sighs) Minnesota and Ohio are holdouts.
If we don't get Dalton on the ballot in those two, we have no hope of keeping Evans or Reynolds from getting to 270, at which point, it's game over.
We've got the team on Minnesota, but I need your help.
- I can't campaign, you know...
- With Ohio, it's...
- I can't campaign!
- it's not campaigning!
We-we just need somebody high profile to take Dalton's place in an NFL pre-game interview.
Slip in something about getting on the ballot, and go have dinner with some state senators.
How is wining and dining state senators
- not campaigning?
- Because I have a room full of lawyers, telling me that isn't!
We are in this ridiculous situation 'cause of your idea to turn our backs on the party and do an independent run.
Be right back.
Assistant Secretary Thompson, I am so sorry
I didn't reach you before you came all the way up here.
The attack in Rome has completely hijacked her schedule...
That was an unfortunate verb choice.
She's not in?
Emergency conference at the White House.
- (phone rings)
- Uh, but I will give that
- to her as soon as she returns.
- Excuse me.
Hi, Louise, what are we cancelling?
Yeah, that should be fine, um...
Uh...
Yes.
I'll have to double-check that.
REPORTER:
Death toll now at 42, with more injured in a suicide bombing...
Hizb Al-Shahid just took credit for the bombing in Rome.
I heard.
Do we believe it?
Well, the sources seem credible.
So, now they're moving from Algeria into Europe.
DEA came through with some Intel on sales of antiquities from North Africa.
See if any of these look like they were looted from St. Gabriel's Monastery before HS blew it up.
Stones from the tomb of the Christian woman in Tipaza.
Not too far from the monastery.
Stones, though; very hard to prove authenticity.
What's this one?
"Reliquary of St. Augustine from the Basilica in Annaba"
Looks like St. Augustine has the same taste as a Corsican drug lord.
Trust me, this is not St. Augustine style.
This is the Colonial French feeling guilty.
See, when France took over Algeria, they felt bad because none of Augustine's remains were in Annaba, his hometown, so they made this reliquary to return his arm bone to the basilica.
Where's Annaba?
Northeastern Algeria.
Part of the ancient city of Hippo Regius.
Maybe HS sacked that place, too?
There's plenty there worth looting.
But I didn't think they'd gotten that far north.
Just like we didn't think they were in Rome.
Let's check with DEA.
See if we can trace this back to the seller.
ELIZABETH:
Susan.
I'm sorry to disrupt your schedule, Madam Secretary.
N-No, no, no.
I'm-I'm sorry to keep you waiting.
The, uh... uh, fallout from Rome has been getting all the attention.
- You know how that goes.
- Oh, I do.
So...
The bombing in Luanda, that was a travesty.
How's Kalanga?
She's injured, but alive, thank God.
A separatist group is taking credit.
I-I'm really sorry that I haven't been able to respond, but I'll issue a statement condemning the... the group's actions in the...
strongest terms.
With all respect, Madam Secretary, the situation in Angola has gone well beyond a statement of condemnation.
Which is why I'm here.
A memo of dissent?
Signed by your entire African Affairs Bureau.
Specifically objecting to our policies in Angola.
For 30 years, President Bestilo has enjoyed generous trade agreements with the United States, a wealth of subsidies, and a blind eye to his increasing corruption
- and cronyism.
- Are you suggesting that President Bestilo was behind the attack?
I'm saying that this administration's deafening silence after an attack that killed twice as many people as that bombing in Rome...
It's just the latest example of ongoing indifference.
So, dissent memo?
Bestilo put a ban on all public assembly this morning, supposedly to protect the people.
But it is obvious he's using this bombing as a cover to silence his opponent.
The people want Kalanga and he knows it.
He's stealing this election.
I can't ask my staff to stand by silently while the administration does nothing.
I will do everything in my power
- to make our deep displeasure known.
- No.
Not another "urge, encourage, concern" phone call.
This needs action, Elizabeth.
If Bestilo is allowed to snuff out a once-in-a-generation candidate, and the rest of the world shrugs 'cause nobody went to Luanda on a honeymoon, that's an African story I'm tired of telling.
NADINE:
We've got some changes to note in the secretary's schedule.
Uh, the Emissions and Deforestation Conference will be postponed.
Thank you.
And we've added the NFL Diplomacy Initiative in Cleveland, ma'am.
(soft murmurs)
Yeah, the... president is stepping off the campaign trail.
I'm just gonna fill in.
As in, campaigning?
No, no.
It-it's just a little... pre-game interview about... football and diplomacy.
Yeah.
Well, Russell Jackson insists it's legal.
Hey, wait.
Who's doing the interview?
James Brown.
Oh.
- I thought he was dead.
- No.
That would be, uh, fellow diplomat and ambassador of soul, James Brown.
This would be
CBS Sportscaster James Brown.
J.B.!
- Hmm.
- NADINE:
And what exactly is it that Russell Jackson would like you to say?
Legally.
Uh...
I think the non-campaigning version of "Please put President Dalton on the ballot in Ohio."
Hey!
What about this?
Um, Dalton's not on the ballot because of the sore loser law, right?
Just recently, the NFL changed the extra point rule...
Yeah, too many kickers were making it, so they moved it back to the 15 yard line.
Right, and just as the NFL can change the rules, to make the game fair and competitive...
So Ohio can reexamine its policy in this historically unprecedented third party run.
- Yes!
- ELIZABETH:
Oh, that's good.
Oh, I like that.
I like that... mm...
G-Give more of those.
Okay, moving on.
Yes, sorry.
We need to talk about the bombing in Angola.
It's awful.
Kalanga survive?
ELIZABETH:
Yeah, with injuries.
83 others were not as lucky.
But President Bestilo is using the attack to suppress his opponent, and this morning,
I received a dissent memo from the Bureau of African Affairs, urging a stronger response.
Um, can I see it?
It's an understandable frustration at our ongoing cooperation with an increasingly corrupt regime.
What I need... are some possible sanctions I can threaten to get President Bestilo to toe the line.
- Cut off aide?
- MATT:
Or agricultural imports.
I mean, they get a ton of poultry and grain from us.
Not sure how American farmers are gonna feel about that.
Not as bad as the Angolans if we cut off their food supply.
- We'll draw up some talking points.
- Thank you.
ELIZABETH:
Hey!
Louise said I could catch you.
Um, could we just slow this down to a jog, please?
We need to talk about Angola.
Why?
The bomb there yesterday.
I don't know if you heard, more dead than in Rome.
Yeah?
Could you do me a favor, and just pretend to listen to me?
Because I just got a dissent memo from my entire African Affairs Bureau, convinced that this administration doesn't know or care that Angola's presidential election is being stolen
- in broad daylight.
- I'm a little preoccupied with another election at the moment.
Why are we still talking about this?
Because I want to remind President Bestilo that he is running a democracy.
So, I would like to threaten to cut our agricultural exports and I just want to make sure that I'm not lighting anybody's hair on fire.
- Do whatever you need to do.
- Okay.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Wait, what?
!
You can't do that!
Why?
Were you not listening this morning?
We have two major agricultural states...
Ohio, Minnesota... where we're fighting for our lives.
Y-Y-You expect me to tell them t-t-that we're just cutting off their, what, fifth biggest importer of poultry in the world?
I knew you listen to me!
Give me a week to get this resolved.
Then you can turn all the screws you want.
I don't have a week.
The election is in four days.
And if Bestilo wins another term, that's one more African nation we lose to an autocratic leader.
Here's a novel idea:
stick to the Prime Directive.
Let democracy take its course... without U.S. interference.
Really?
A Star Trek reference?
I deeply appreciate your compassion, Madam Secretary,
But Angola is strong.
We will endure.
I'm sure you will, Mr. President.
However, I am concerned that your ban on public gatherings may interfere with the democratic process.
It is for the safety of my people.
I refuse to make them a target again.
ELIZABETH:
Yes, but, Mr. President...
"Damiano," please.
I just want to remind you that in order to continue our support of Angola, we need to know that you will support the will of the people.
I find these conversations so inspiring.
Thank you, Madam Secretary.
Good luck with your own election.
It seems you're going to need it.
Urge, encourage... and concern.
Did I leave something out?
Mollify and assuage?
HENRY:
Are you kidding me?
Who wrote these talking points?
The Browns have got way bigger problems thank finding a go-to receiver on third down.
Can I just say how adorable it is that this is the most opinionated you've been about my job in, like, ever?
Well, it's better than reading that FBI report.
I mean, 58 pages to say they still can't find whoever's hacking our house and stalking our entire family?
Yes, I know, I know.
On the other hand, no new incidents.
See?
Staying positive, trusting the system.
Well, you're doing better than I am.
You have a rough day?
(sighs)
I got a dissent memo on Angola.
Is that like when a student files an appeal 'cause they don't like their grade?
It's an anonymous communication channel to allow anyone at the State Department to formally oppose foreign policy they don't agree with.
So...
I got the bad grade.
That attack in Luanda was rough.
Okay, can you just tell me that
I do a great job at other things.
- I...
Right now, I just need to hear...
- Oh, hey, hey, hey.
Come on, come on.
You are the very best student in the whole State Department.
And you know... what I give to my best students.
- Wait...
- What?
Oh, God!
- Oh, no, no, no, no.
- No, no, no.
It's not...
It was getting weird anyway.
I just wanted to tell you that Jareth is coming for a visit.
Well, that's great.
When does he get here?
Wednesday, actually.
Kinda last-minute.
Well, I'll say, but what a great surprise.
Yeah, it's... it's okay if he stays here?
- Yeah, of course.
- Yes.
Sure.
Okay, thank you.
- Yes!
I'm so excited.
- HENRY:
Yay.
Sweetie, that's great.
So are we!
(Elizabeth chuckles)
It's okay that he stays here, right?
Of course, I love that kid.
No, I mean, you know, she's got that tiny little twin bed with the girly bedspread.
You think that'd be comfortable?
Well, I think they'll get comfortable.
Really?
Well, I remember we got pretty comfortable with your...
Okay, but we didn't have Will in the next room
(whispering) with a very thin wall.
- Oh, God, Jason.
- Yeah.
- Will you say something to her?
- Yes.
- I do, I will, I'll talk to her, yeah.
- Just to be quiet.
ELIZABETH:
Yes, Daisy, what's up?
DAISY (on phone):
Ma'am, I just got a heads up from a guy at the Post.
They have a copy of the dissent memo, and they're about to run it.
Well, that's a disaster.
Did he...
Did he say how he got it?
I couldn't get it out of him, and it's too late to kill it...
I tried.
Okay, well, I want to know who leaked it, so you do whatever you have to, okay?
Yes, ma'am.
And, listen, for what it's worth, the news cycle is still on the attack in Rome.
We might be okay.
(sighs) Thanks, Daisy.
What the hell is this about a dissent memo?
Now, tell me Madam Secretary, when are we going to see
NFL football in, say, France?
Well, that... that's a...
that's a tricky question.
I think, uh, every country loves its game just as much as we love ours.
And change is hard.
1906, football fans were scandalized by the invention of the forward pass, and now it's a definitive signature of the game.
So rules do need to evolve.
Now, President Dalton is looking to make a few changed in the upcoming election, too, isn't that right?
Well, I'm...
I'm happy that you brought that up.
Uh... because as much as President Dalton is supported and trusted by the American people, certain rules will need to evolve to accommodate this historic third-party run.
Well, with that being said, we're gonna take a little break, but, Secretary McCord, thank you again
- for taking the time.
- It's my pleasure.
Go, Browns!
JULIUS:
Is that Russell Jackson?
Julius!
Well, look at us.
Even without the support of our key donor, we somehow manage to stay in the game.
I love it when he stays in sales mode.
(all chuckle)
Madam Secretary, I wanted to introduce you to a friend of mine.
Secretary McCord, Scott Goodman, KronicDM.
Oh, my son loves your messaging app.
He thinks I don't know what the name means.
- Oh, uh-oh, mom's hip.
- (chuckles)
Well, I'm glad he's hooked in.
I was wondering, could I grab a minute?
Uh, sure.
How's it going with Sam Evans?
You ready to admit you backed the wrong horse?
Let's just say I haven't placed any bets yet.
I saw that story about your staff throwing a flags on the play in Africa.
Ah, the dissent memo, yes.
Yeah, I gotta tell you, from a tech point of view, we're pretty frustrated, too.
We're trying to get KronicDM going in Southern Africa, but these countries are killing us with these OTT taxes.
A fee to use their telecom services, right?
- Over-the-top tax?
- Yes, even the name...
"over-the-top"
Most Africans aren't online.
They just... they have phones.
So we're how they're staying connected, but these state-owned telecom services are strangling us with these fees.
To be fair, your app is using their services, right?
So shouldn't they ask you to help pay for it?
Come on, Secretary.
I mean, they could privatize telecom, and the whole economy would benefit.
But then they wouldn't be able to monitor everything that their citizens are saying, or turn it off whenever they want to.
I mean, state-owned telecom, it's bad for democracy, and it's bad for business.
I understand your frustration, but the thing about emerging economies, Scott, is that they have to be allowed to do just that... emerge.
It's... it's a process.
If I wanted to, right now,
I could cut a deal with one country and piggyback one network across most of Southern Africa for free, the way it should be.
But I'm not doing that 'cause I'm hoping my elected
- officials are gonna do their job...
- Appointed.
I'm afraid that's all the time the secretary has.
Oh, gosh, Scott, too bad.
Thanks so much.
I haven't been mansplained that hard since Craig Sterling was in office.
Good job on the interview.
Too bad it won't save us.
What do you mean?
We just got word the Times is holding back on the endorsement.
They want to let this dissent memo play out first.
Just long enough so it won't do us any good.
Hey, you want some of this?
I don't even know what it is.
- It's mushroom soufflé.
- Don't you want to heat that up?
No, I'm barely tasting it anyway.
So, Jareth tomorrow.
That's exciting.
Yep.
You know, Dad and I are really happy that he's gonna stay with us, but maybe we should just talk about one thing.
What, the fact that if we move to England
I might end up killing myself?
What?
Yeah.
Sweetheart... what happened?
The whole summer was awful.
His friends, his family.
The stupid weather.
Wait, you-you've been home almost a month.
Why didn't you say something?
Denial?
I don't know.
It was embarrassing.
I mean...
- you guys were so happy for me.
- Well...
And it was supposed to be the best summer of my life.
Instead, I turned into this total baby.
Leaving dinner parties to go cry in the bathroom.
Well, a little culture shock is to be expected.
It was more like culture electrocution.
Oh.
Well, how's Jareth?
That was the worst part.
He was kind of a totally different person, too.
I mean, like snobby, and he cared what school everybody went to.
He was, like, turning away from me if I made the wrong joke.
Sounds like you guys definitely have some stuff to talk about.
I don't want you to think he's a bad person.
He's just...
British, it turns out.
Now, but, Stevie, you have to be straight with him.
You can't pretend you're fine when you're not.
That's not how marriage works.
I know.
I just...
I don't know how he's gonna take it.
HENRY:
All right, here's the part of the DEA surveillance footage we need.
Here she is coming into the guy's house to make the sale.
It's the same person.
What's an antiquities expert at a history museum doing selling stolen treasures to Corsican drug lords?
There's nothing in her background to support it.
I don't know.
Maybe she needs the money.
Maybe she just likes gangsters.
The only thing we really need to know is where she got the reliquary.
We can bring her in, but she can't know what we're up to.
Maybe we could use French intelligence.
I'm sure they'd be interested in what she's doing.
Not yet.
You bring her in quietly, find out what she knows, and take it from there.
Morning.
- Morning.
- Morning.
- Morning
Marcia Forman is having a field day with this dissent memo.
Marcia Forman is an unhappy woman desperately trying to make herself relevant.
Aren't we all?
Except I'm not a woman.
Sorry. finishing my first round of interviews.
NADINE:
Any leads?
I talked to most of the mid-level Africa desk.
They're in full denial mode.
But I have IT doing an e-mail search for terms that might indicate a grudge against the White House.
Dalton/idiot, McCord/idiot,
- Ouch.
- Dalton/traitor...
- Daisy, keep at it.
Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.
All right, where are we on the sanctions on Angola?
- Anybody...
- Excuse me, Madam Secretary.
I'm sorry to interrupt, but I'm having a little trouble getting my work done while my entire staff is being rounded up for interrogation.
- It was an investigation.
- We have to look into the memo leak.
It's been very destabilizing.
Not to mention criminal.
Fine.
I leaked it.
- (all gasp)
- You want to arrest somebody, arrest me.
Okay, come on.
I am sorry for questioning your staff, but...
Bestilo's put her under house arrest.
Kalanga.
Really?
- When?
- This morning, to protect her security.
And I would love to see this office take half as much interest in a supposedly democratic ally openly stealing an election as you have shown in one leaked document.
Hey, Susan, you got to stop accusing me of not caring.
There are parameters and you know that.
When was the last time you set foot in Southern Africa?
- I...
- But you find time to go to NFL games, and...
I'm so sorry.
I...
You know what?
I-I just give up.
I'd rather work in the private sector and actually get something done.
- Susan...
- Thank you for taking a chance on me.
Madam Secretary, you can consider this my resignation.
(sighs)
Can we talk about this?
Yes.
I'd appreciate it if you let me turn myself in.
I'd rather my staff not see me led out by security.
I know you didn't leak that memo.
That's not what my memoir will say.
And if you think I'm gonna inform on anybody...
No, I don't actually care who leaked it.
I just don't want to lose you.
But you have to understand.
I-I'm playing ten dimensional chess here.
If I could've threatened to cut off agricultural imports and sanction oil when I called Bestilo,
I would've done it.
But we are having an election of our own and, like it or not, we all serve at the pleasure.
And this is exactly the problem with our approach in Africa.
We go in with our studies, and our expertise, and our aid, and we don't even know what we don't know.
Bestilo doesn't care if his people starve.
So, if you really want to get him where he lives, you don't read reports.
You talk to people who know him.
You're right.
So how do we get him where he lives?
Putting your opponent under house arrest is clearly meant to protect your own security, Mr. President, not Kalanga's.
I do not wish to run against a martyr.
But as always, Madam Secretary,
I appreciate your opinion.
It is the United States' opinion.
Therefore, we're demanding the release of Bertilde Kalanga within two hours.
If you do not comply, I'm prepared to impose a travel ban on all Angolan citizens into the United States.
It would be a shame if Amalia Salessu were unable to finish her sophomore year at Stanford.
But, of course, if she's no longer attending school out of the country, maybe she can get to know her half-sister better.
Unless, of course, your daughter Lauana doesn't know she has a half-sister.
I have to wonder, Elizabeth, at President Dalton's boldness in dictating the election procedures of a small African nation when he himself seems to be making up the rules as he goes along.
You have enjoyed many years of generous support and aid from us with little accountability.
But accountability comes in many forms, Damiano.
I regret my years of loyalty mean so little to you.
Our warm relations can be restored if you agree to free Bertilde Kalanga and allow your people a free and fair election.
As your own president follows the dictates of democracy, so shall I.
(exhales)
That seemed a little ominous.
Trust me, that's as close to a checkmate as you're gonna get.
He's shaking.
Well, let's see if an illegitimate daughter will have any effect.
JARETH:
Oh, brilliant.
Finally come round to real tea.
Trying.
Kind of makes my teeth squeak.
Oh, well, that's because it's actual tea, not colored water.
Oh, leave the bag in, woman.
Have I taught you nothing?
I am incorrigible.
I, uh, I heard you say that to your mother when you thought I was out of the room.
Oh... dear.
Of course, I-I had made the scandalous error of pouring the milk after the tea.
I'm sorry I said that.
I don't think that.
I actually find you quite corrigible.
The whole summer, um, I-I felt like... the idiot American girl who doesn't know how to drink tea and doesn't have the right shoes.
That's not how I see you at all.
Why would anyone pour the milk before the tea?
It doesn't make any sense, you can't tell how strong it is.
I looked it up.
George Orwell is with me on this.
God, I hate England.
I'm right there with you.
It brings out the absolute worst in me.
I'm sorry.
Honestly, I mean, the thought of going back there kind of gives me a panic attack.
Well, then let's not.
Really?
I'm miserable without you.
I love the States.
You love the States.
Let's live in the States.
But what about your fellowship?
Please, if a cat can be both alive and dead simultaneously,
I'm sure I can find another fellowship in theoretical physics.
Probably only makes sense to another physicist.
Um, the important thing is that we are our best selves to each other.
Always.
All right.
Keep talking physics to me.
Yeah?
No, don't.
JOSE:
We get the archeologist?
HENRY:
We just brought her in, but she's not talking yet.
Ask her about the statues.
Those are the St. Gabriel statues.
She's dealing with Hizb Al-Shahid.
And the best part is, they haven't seen her.
Right, so, we pick her up, we let her think she's being held by French intelligence.
We'll find an agent who can pass for her, set up a meeting to buy one of these statues, and boom, we have a direct line to Hizb Al-Shahid in Algeria.
Except these guys go through couriers because they can't meet with women.
So, all we have to do is find an agent who looks like this archaeologist, who speaks perfect French, and then somehow convince these extremists that they should violate their religion and meet her face-to-face so she can set up the op.
But, yeah, once we do all that, it's like you said, "Boom."
(elevator bell dings)
Good morning, Madam Secretary.
Not while I'm still reading about the dissent memo.
We just got word that Bertilde Kalanga was released from house arrest in Angola.
Hope that helps.
It does.
When do the polls open?
About 16 hours.
Uh, Assistant Secretary Thompson is here, presumably to share the diplomatic equivalent of a high five.
Susan, I just heard.
Bestilo released Kalanga.
He also shut down all Internet service in Angola.
He cannot stop suppressing freedom of speech, can he?
It's worse than that.
I just got word from the embassy, military and police are surrounding poll stations as we speak.
What is he doing?
Suppressing voters with no way for anyone to see what he's up to until it's too late.
Won't the press expose him?
- No, they do whatever he tells them to do.
- He controls it.
But he can't control social media.
If the people show each other what he's doing, he knows they'll rise up.
Same reason Mubarak shut down Internet during the Arab Spring.
Said it was for maintenance.
Maintenance of the status quo.
(sighs)
I thought we were getting through to him.
SUSAN:
We should initiate a travel ban.
Threaten to cut off food, even if we can't do it.
No, we-we can't make threats if we we're not willing to follow through on them.
It's like you said, what does he care if his people starve?
Unfortunately, this is the position we've put Angolans in by making them dependent on our food supply.
What about U.N. forces?
Hang on.
You're absolutely right.
Subsidized agriculture was the wrong idea.
We have to let them harvest their own crops, right?
Blake!
JOSE:
Who did you say sent you?
I represent a buyer from Bastia, Lucas Hervé.
Why doesn't he come himself?
He's a businessman.
He needs to be discreet.
So he sends an archaeologist who deals in the black market?
You're pretty high risk.
I have connections to passionate collectors from many different worlds.
Did the reliquary contain the relics of St. Augustine?
It was only the outside the buyer was interested in.
Sounds like you're covering.
That's something an archaeologist would know.
JOSE:
But not something that HS would care about.
Where are you from?
Paris.
18th arrondissement.
Then why does your accent sound southern?
My mother is from Marseille.
I spent my summers there growing up.
I lived with my grandmother.
You just gave us three ways to pull you apart when you just needed to give us one.
(sighs)
Of course.
Ask me again.
I think we got enough.
Great work, Cecile.
Very impressive.
Thanks for coming in.
(door opens, closes)
Well, she looks like our archaeologist.
Her French is perfect.
She's too green.
I know from when Elizabeth was starting out, you want an agent with something to prove.
She can do it.
She'll be sitting face-to-face with members of Hizb Al-Shahid.
It's too important to go with an agent because she reminds you of your wife.
It's too important not to.
JARETH:
Of course.
Yes, I promise.
Okay, Mum.
Yeah, bye, bye, bye, bye.
Hey, I think I found a really cool place in Kingsman Park.
Oh, sorry, I'm completely late for my interview.
And this public transport app is utter rubbish.
- Sorry, um...
- Bad phone call?
Yeah.
Apparently my father is flummoxed that I've thrown away my career, and he's decided to cut me off.
Not that I mind that too much.
I've always hated the way he dangles the inheritance to keep us all in line.
Quite happy to step out of that mini colonialist drama.
How do you not know where George Washington University is?
I'm confused...
I thought your parents were academics.
Yeah, well, they can afford to be, thanks to Mum's title and all that.
Your mother has a title?
Yes.
Lady Sutherland.
Dad just married in, but it doesn't stop him from using it for all it's worth.
I'm sorry, how did I not know any of this?
Could it be the accent?
I actually worked really hard on it.
Okay, look, you'd have hated it.
The country manor in the Cotswolds is basically just a farm with glowering portraits.
The chateau in Provence is a little bit more fun, but I think my sister will have us over for visits so she can just lord it over me.
- Oh, I have to go.
I really have to go.
- Jareth, stop.
Is your father right?
Is this a huge mistake?
It's too late now.
The Brexit vote is in, and there's no turning back.
- So I'll talk to you later.
Mwah!
- Wh...
I really have to go.
Scott, thank you so much for taking the time.
Where you calling me from, 2012?
Super Mario had more pixels.
You guys gotta let me help you out.
(laughs)
Well, I'm...
I'm glad you're in a charitable mood because I've got a... a proposition.
Do you remember saying that if you wanted to, you could extend free Internet access to all of Southern Africa?
By piggybacking off one network, yeah.
I might have overstated the reach.
If I can make a deal with Zambia, do you think you could set up a makeshift network in Angola in...
Well, in the next 12 hours?
Well, I assume this is a tax-free situation we're talking about... no OTTs.
Well... that's the thing.
Um, this network you're setting up will only exist for 24 hours.
Just enough time for Angola to elect its next president in a free and fair election.
After that, you'd have to pay whatever taxes Angola wants.
But if the people's candidate wins, I'm pretty sure we can discourage state-run telecoms
- Here you go.
- all together.
Well, I like the sound of that.
Good, because you'll be helping me do that by sending in a team to train Angolans to build their own private telecom networks... for free.
The way it should be.
However, I-I do have to tell you that if Bertilde Kalanga doesn't win today, then, well, both of us are probably never gonna work in Angola again.
(laughs)
Why would I agree to this?
Because you want to build democracy.
And because, if your company, KronicDM, is the force behind an Internet-led revolution that leads Angola to expose a corrupt regime and elect its first female president, that's gonna make a really kickass Super Bowl commercial.
Huh.
Yup.
Ballot-stuffing in Benguela.
MATT:
I've got it on a live feed.
I've got somebody facing down a line of military trucks trying to block the poll access.
Yeah, and a bunch of people joining him.
It's like a flash mob without all the dancing.
Well, the news cycle has shifted from the leaked memo.
Thank you, KronicDM.
SUSAN:
Thank the Angolans.
They're the ones putting their lives at risk to expose him.
Yes.
All right, that was the embassy.
So far, everything seems calm in Luanda.
Let's hope the eyes of the world are enough to keep Bestilo from lashing out.
(protesters shouting)
STEVIE:
Hey, Dad.
Hey.
Where's Jareth?
He's out with friends.
I was at the library.
Want to watch the Angolan election with me?
- First woman president.
- Kalanga won?
Not yet.
Here.
It's vegan.
Mom told me about the whole "I hate England" crisis.
Yeah, well, it's been replaced by the "Jareth is losing out on his inheritance if he stays here" crisis.
- They're disinheriting him?
- Yeah.
Wow, that's extreme.
It also might be because he's marrying someone who doesn't know how to pour tea, but I didn't ask.
Well, even if they cut him off, they're still gonna be your in-laws, so you guys gotta work that out.
How is Jareth doing?
Great.
Supposedly.
(chuckles) Couldn't be happier about being liberated from the tyranny of title and property.
- (chuckles)
- But he's conflicted.
I know he is.
Especially about leaving Oxford.
Isn't this where you give me the wise counsel of experience?
Sorry, I got nothin' except welcome to marriage.
Huge, important life decisions... with unexpected consequences, all taken on a leap of faith.
What if we stay, and he ends up resenting me for losing everything?
Oh, honey, he will.
A-at some point.
And you guys will work through it.
(sighs)
Or not.
That can happen, too.
That's it?
What about the, you know, if you love each other, you can make it through anything?
You know what my dad said to me the night before I got married?
"Marriage is the nicest way to confront your own inadequacies on a daily basis"
You should write that in a song.
Huh.
It's also the greatest journey you'll ever go on.
And you get to go on it with your best friend.
(glass clinks)
When are they gonna call this?
I definitely don't have time for Bush v. Gore.
My wife's gonna kill me as it is.
If they haven't called it, he hasn't stolen it.
Well, still no word from the embassy, but the Bureau of African Affairs sent over doughnuts.
Suck-ups!
Well, I am not above a suck-up doughnut.
Oh, glazed.
(clears throat)
Sorry about the investigation.
Are you offering me my own department's doughnut as an apology?
Yep.
Let's just say it's more of a thank you than an apology.
Releasing the dissent memo, whoever released it...
I'm sorry it was necessary.
(sighs) They haven't wrapped this thing up yet?
Still waiting.
May I interest you in a doughnut?
No, thanks.
- Where's the, uh, Secretary?
- ELIZABETH:
We did it!
- DAISY:
Oh, Kalanga won!
- Yes, we did it!
- (all exclaiming, cheering)
- JACKSON:
Look at that!
And you didn't even have to use agriculture.
All I had to do was work with the people.
JACKSON:
I'd like to see the New York Times hold out on us now.
Oh, Russ, don't be so sentimental!
Just stopped by to let you know we're on the ballot in Ohio.
Not that you're campaigning.
Oh, this day is full of wonders.
- True that.
- (laughs)
Actually, I'll, uh...
I'll have a sprinkles.
You should fly in for the inauguration.
It's good optics.
Um, I may fit that in my schedule.
Will you join me?
Hey, guys, check it out.

It's taking too long.
We should have put a wire on her.
JOSE:
That's her.
She's alone.
That's good.
Cecile, all clear?
They bought it.
And they're going to let me appraise the statues in Algeria.
We meet sometime next week.
That's fantastic.
Good work.
Get back to base.
Did we set a pick-up?
This is Black Dog Station.
Who the hell just took our agent?
This morning's bombing in Rome is more than just a brutal attack on one of the most beautiful cities in the world.
This is a threat which will be answered.
Governor, Governor, you've said that as president, you would increase surveillance of Muslim Americans...
Whoa, whoa.
First of all, no group has claimed responsibility yet for the bombing at Stazione Triumfale in Rome.
And I would never suggest infringing on the rights
- of America citizens, ever.
- Yeah?
He doesn't suggest it.
He wants to legislate it.
But if an attack does occur...
Nice suit, though.
His staff's definitely working overtime.
They've pulled him off the campaign trail so he can keep running around showing off his new global concern.
No mention of the bombing in Angola, I notice.
Twice as many dead as in Rome.
But if the press doesn't mention it, why should he?
Of course, this means that I have to pull Conrad off the trail, too.
Right after that China speech last week got us a two point bump in the polls.
But we still have an election to pull out of thin air.
I thought it was... less than a total long shot, which...
I took to be boundless optimism coming from you.
New York Times is about to endorse us, which should reassure the centrists.
And we are making progress getting those sore loser laws changed to get him on the ballot in the states we missed in the primaries.
I'm sensing an Eeyore footnote.
Minnesota and Ohio are holdouts.
If we don't get Dalton on the ballot in those two, we have no hope of keeping Evans or Reynolds from getting to 270, at which point, it's game over.
We've got the team on Minnesota, but I need your help.
- I can't campaign, you know...
- With Ohio, it's...
- I can't campaign!
- it's not campaigning!
We-we just need somebody high profile to take Dalton's place in an NFL pre-game interview.
Slip in something about getting on the ballot, and go have dinner with some state senators.
How is wining and dining state senators
- not campaigning?
- Because I have a room full of lawyers, telling me that isn't!
We are in this ridiculous situation 'cause of your idea to turn our backs on the party and do an independent run.
Be right back.
Assistant Secretary Thompson, I am so sorry
I didn't reach you before you came all the way up here.
The attack in Rome has completely hijacked her schedule...
That was an unfortunate verb choice.
She's not in?
Emergency conference at the White House.
Uh, but I will give that
- to her as soon as she returns.
- Excuse me.
Hi, Louise, what are we cancelling?
Yeah, that should be fine, um...
Uh...
Yes.
I'll have to double-check that.
Death toll now at 42, with more injured in a suicide bombing...
Hizb Al-Shahid just took credit for the bombing in Rome.
I heard.
Do we believe it?
Well, the sources seem credible.
So, now they're moving from Algeria into Europe.
DEA came through with some Intel on sales of antiquities from North Africa.
See if any of these look like they were looted from St. Gabriel's Monastery before HS blew it up.
Stones from the tomb of the Christian woman in Tipaza.
Not too far from the monastery.
Stones, though; very hard to prove authenticity.
What's this one?
"Reliquary of St. Augustine from the Basilica in Annaba"
Looks like St. Augustine has the same taste as a Corsican drug lord.
Trust me, this is not St. Augustine style.
This is the Colonial French feeling guilty.
See, when France took over Algeria, they felt bad because none of Augustine's remains were in Annaba, his hometown, so they made this reliquary to return his arm bone to the basilica.
Where's Annaba?
Northeastern Algeria.
Part of the ancient city of Hippo Regius.
Maybe HS sacked that place, too?
There's plenty there worth looting.
But I didn't think they'd gotten that far north.
Just like we didn't think they were in Rome.
Let's check with DEA.
See if we can trace this back to the seller.
Susan.
I'm sorry to disrupt your schedule, Madam Secretary.
N-No, no, no.
I'm-I'm sorry to keep you waiting.
The, uh... uh, fallout from Rome has been getting all the attention.
- You know how that goes.
- Oh, I do.
So...
The bombing in Luanda, that was a travesty.
How's Kalanga?
She's injured, but alive, thank God.
A separatist group is taking credit.
I-I'm really sorry that I haven't been able to respond, but I'll issue a statement condemning the... the group's actions in the... strongest terms.
With all respect, Madam Secretary, the situation in Angola has gone well beyond a statement of condemnation.
Which is why I'm here.
A memo of dissent?
Signed by your entire African Affairs Bureau.
Specifically objecting to our policies in Angola.
For 30 years, President Bestilo has enjoyed generous trade agreements with the United States, a wealth of subsidies, and a blind eye to his increasing corruption
- and cronyism.
- Are you suggesting that President Bestilo was behind the attack?
I'm saying that this administration's deafening silence after an attack that killed twice as many people as that bombing in Rome...
It's just the latest example of ongoing indifference.
So, dissent memo?
Bestilo put a ban on all public assembly this morning, supposedly to protect the people.
But it is obvious he's using this bombing as a cover to silence his opponent.
The people want Kalanga and he knows it.
He's stealing this election.
I can't ask my staff to stand by silently while the administration does nothing.
I will do everything in my power
- to make our deep displeasure known.
- No.
Not another "urge, encourage, concern" phone call.
This needs action, Elizabeth.
If Bestilo is allowed to snuff out a once-in-a-generation candidate, and the rest of the world shrugs 'cause nobody went to Luanda on a honeymoon, that's an African story I'm tired of telling.
We've got some changes to note in the secretary's schedule.
Uh, the Emissions and Deforestation Conference will be postponed.
Thank you.
And we've added the NFL Diplomacy Initiative in Cleveland, ma'am.
Yeah, the... president is stepping off the campaign trail.
I'm just gonna fill in.
As in, campaigning?
No, no.
It-it's just a little... pre-game interview about... football and diplomacy.
Yeah.
Well, Russell Jackson insists it's legal.
Hey, wait.
Who's doing the interview?
James Brown.
Oh.
- I thought he was dead.
- No.
That would be, uh, fellow diplomat and ambassador of soul, James Brown.
This would be
CBS Sportscaster James Brown.
J.B.!
- Hmm.
- And what exactly is it that Russell Jackson would like you to say?
Legally.
Uh...
I think the non-campaigning version of "Please put President Dalton on the ballot in Ohio."
Hey!
What about this?
Um, Dalton's not on the ballot because of the sore loser law, right?
Just recently, the NFL changed the extra point rule...
Yeah, too many kickers were making it, so they moved it back to the 15 yard line.
Right, and just as the NFL can change the rules, to make the game fair and competitive...
So Ohio can reexamine its policy in this historically unprecedented third party run.
- Yes!
- Oh, that's good.
Oh, I like that.
I like that... mm...
G-Give more of those.
Okay, moving on.
Yes, sorry.
We need to talk about the bombing in Angola.
It's awful.
Kalanga survive?
Yeah, with injuries.
83 others were not as lucky.
But President Bestilo is using the attack to suppress his opponent, and this morning,
I received a dissent memo from the Bureau of African Affairs, urging a stronger response.
Um, can I see it?
It's an understandable frustration at our ongoing cooperation with an increasingly corrupt regime.
What I need... are some possible sanctions I can threaten to get President Bestilo to toe the line.
- Cut off aide?
- Or agricultural imports.
I mean, they get a ton of poultry and grain from us.
Not sure how American farmers are gonna feel about that.
Not as bad as the Angolans if we cut off their food supply.
- We'll draw up some talking points.
- Thank you.
Hey!
Louise said I could catch you.
Um, could we just slow this down to a jog, please?
We need to talk about Angola.
Why?
The bomb there yesterday.
I don't know if you heard, more dead than in Rome.
Yeah?
Could you do me a favor, and just pretend to listen to me?
Because I just got a dissent memo from my entire African Affairs Bureau, convinced that this administration doesn't know or care that Angola's presidential election is being stolen
- in broad daylight.
- I'm a little preoccupied with another election at the moment.
Why are we still talking about this?
Because I want to remind President Bestilo that he is running a democracy.
So, I would like to threaten to cut our agricultural exports and I just want to make sure that I'm not lighting anybody's hair on fire.
- Do whatever you need to do.
- Okay.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Wait, what?
!
You can't do that!
Why?
Were you not listening this morning?
We have two major agricultural states...
Ohio, Minnesota... where we're fighting for our lives.
Y-Y-You expect me to tell them t-t-that we're just cutting off their, what, fifth biggest importer of poultry in the world?
I knew you listen to me!
Give me a week to get this resolved.
Then you can turn all the screws you want.
I don't have a week.
The election is in four days.
And if Bestilo wins another term, that's one more African nation we lose to an autocratic leader.
Here's a novel idea: stick to the Prime Directive.
Let democracy take its course... without U.S. interference.
Really?
A Star Trek reference?
I deeply appreciate your compassion, Madam Secretary,
But Angola is strong.
We will endure.
I'm sure you will, Mr. President.
However, I am concerned that your ban on public gatherings may interfere with the democratic process.
It is for the safety of my people.
I refuse to make them a target again.
Yes, but, Mr. President...
"Damiano," please.
I just want to remind you that in order to continue our support of Angola, we need to know that you will support the will of the people.
I find these conversations so inspiring.
Thank you, Madam Secretary.
Good luck with your own election.
It seems you're going to need it.
Urge, encourage... and concern.
Did I leave something out?
Mollify and assuage?
Are you kidding me?
Who wrote these talking points?
The Browns have got way bigger problems thank finding a go-to receiver on third down.
Can I just say how adorable it is that this is the most opinionated you've been about my job in, like, ever?
Well, it's better than reading that FBI report.
I mean, 58 pages to say they still can't find whoever's hacking our house and stalking our entire family?
Yes, I know, I know.
On the other hand, no new incidents.
See?
Staying positive, trusting the system.
Well, you're doing better than I am.
You have a rough day?
I got a dissent memo on Angola.
Is that like when a student files an appeal 'cause they don't like their grade?
It's an anonymous communication channel to allow anyone at the State Department to formally oppose foreign policy they don't agree with.
So...
I got the bad grade.
That attack in Luanda was rough.
Okay, can you just tell me that
I do a great job at other things.
- I...
Right now, I just need to hear...
- Oh, hey, hey, hey.
Come on, come on.
You are the very best student in the whole State Department.
And you know... what I give to my best students.
- Wait...
- What?
Oh, God!
- Oh, no, no, no, no.
- No, no, no.
It's not...
It was getting weird anyway.
I just wanted to tell you that Jareth is coming for a visit.
Well, that's great.
When does he get here?
Wednesday, actually.
Kinda last-minute.
Well, I'll say, but what a great surprise.
Yeah, it's... it's okay if he stays here?
- Yeah, of course.
- Yes.
Sure.
Okay, thank you.
- Yes!
I'm so excited.
- Yay.
Sweetie, that's great.
So are we!
It's okay that he stays here, right?
Of course, I love that kid.
No, I mean, you know, she's got that tiny little twin bed with the girly bedspread.
You think that'd be comfortable?
Well, I think they'll get comfortable.
Really?
Well, I remember we got pretty comfortable with your...
Okay, but we didn't have Will in the next room with a very thin wall.
- Oh, God, Jason.
- Yeah.
- Will you say something to her?
- Yes.
- I do, I will, I'll talk to her, yeah.
- Just to be quiet.
Yes, Daisy, what's up?
Ma'am, I just got a heads up from a guy at the Post.
They have a copy of the dissent memo, and they're about to run it.
Well, that's a disaster.
Did he...
Did he say how he got it?
I couldn't get it out of him, and it's too late to kill it...
I tried.
Okay, well, I want to know who leaked it, so you do whatever you have to, okay?
Yes, ma'am.
And, listen, for what it's worth, the news cycle is still on the attack in Rome.
We might be okay.
Thanks, Daisy.
What the hell is this about a dissent memo?
Now, tell me Madam Secretary, when are we going to see
NFL football in, say, France?
Well, that... that's a...
that's a tricky question.
I think, uh, every country loves its game just as much as we love ours.
And change is hard.
1906, football fans were scandalized by the invention of the forward pass, and now it's a definitive signature of the game.
So rules do need to evolve.
Now, President Dalton is looking to make a few changed in the upcoming election, too, isn't that right?
Well, I'm...
I'm happy that you brought that up.
Uh... because as much as President Dalton is supported and trusted by the American people, certain rules will need to evolve to accommodate this historic third-party run.
Well, with that being said, we're gonna take a little break, but, Secretary McCord, thank you again
- for taking the time.
- It's my pleasure.
Go, Browns!
Is that Russell Jackson?
Julius!
Well, look at us.
Even without the support of our key donor, we somehow manage to stay in the game.
I love it when he stays in sales mode.
Madam Secretary, I wanted to introduce you to a friend of mine.
Secretary McCord, Scott Goodman, KronicDM.
Oh, my son loves your messaging app.
He thinks I don't know what the name means.
Oh, uh-oh, mom's hip.
Well, I'm glad he's hooked in.
I was wondering, could I grab a minute?
Uh, sure.
How's it going with Sam Evans?
You ready to admit you backed the wrong horse?
Let's just say I haven't placed any bets yet.
I saw that story about your staff throwing a flags on the play in Africa.
Ah, the dissent memo, yes.
Yeah, I gotta tell you, from a tech point of view, we're pretty frustrated, too.
We're trying to get KronicDM going in Southern Africa, but these countries are killing us with these OTT taxes.
A fee to use their telecom services, right?
- Over-the-top tax?
- Yes, even the name...
"over-the-top"
Most Africans aren't online.
They just... they have phones.
So we're how they're staying connected, but these state-owned telecom services are strangling us with these fees.
To be fair, your app is using their services, right?
So shouldn't they ask you to help pay for it?
Come on, Secretary.
I mean, they could privatize telecom, and the whole economy would benefit.
But then they wouldn't be able to monitor everything that their citizens are saying, or turn it off whenever they want to.
I mean, state-owned telecom, it's bad for democracy, and it's bad for business.
I understand your frustration, but the thing about emerging economies, Scott, is that they have to be allowed to do just that... emerge.
It's... it's a process.
If I wanted to, right now,
I could cut a deal with one country and piggyback one network across most of Southern Africa for free, the way it should be.
But I'm not doing that 'cause I'm hoping my elected
- officials are gonna do their job...
- Appointed.
I'm afraid that's all the time the secretary has.
Oh, gosh, Scott, too bad.
Thanks so much.
I haven't been mansplained that hard since Craig Sterling was in office.
Good job on the interview.
Too bad it won't save us.
What do you mean?
We just got word the Times is holding back on the endorsement.
They want to let this dissent memo play out first.
Just long enough so it won't do us any good.
Hey, you want some of this?
I don't even know what it is.
- It's mushroom soufflé.
- Don't you want to heat that up?
No, I'm barely tasting it anyway.
So, Jareth tomorrow.
That's exciting.
Yep.
You know, Dad and I are really happy that he's gonna stay with us, but maybe we should just talk about one thing.
What, the fact that if we move to England
I might end up killing myself?
What?
Yeah.
Sweetheart... what happened?
The whole summer was awful.
His friends, his family.
The stupid weather.
Wait, you-you've been home almost a month.
Why didn't you say something?
Denial?
I don't know.
It was embarrassing.
I mean...
- you guys were so happy for me.
- Well...
And it was supposed to be the best summer of my life.
Instead, I turned into this total baby.
Leaving dinner parties to go cry in the bathroom.
Well, a little culture shock is to be expected.
It was more like culture electrocution.
Oh.
Well, how's Jareth?
That was the worst part.
He was kind of a totally different person, too.
I mean, like snobby, and he cared what school everybody went to.
He was, like, turning away from me if I made the wrong joke.
Sounds like you guys definitely have some stuff to talk about.
I don't want you to think he's a bad person.
He's just...
British, it turns out.
Now, but, Stevie, you have to be straight with him.
You can't pretend you're fine when you're not.
That's not how marriage works.
I know.
I just...
I don't know how he's gonna take it.
All right, here's the part of the DEA surveillance footage we need.
Here she is coming into the guy's house to make the sale.
It's the same person.
What's an antiquities expert at a history museum doing selling stolen treasures to Corsican drug lords?
There's nothing in her background to support it.
I don't know.
Maybe she needs the money.
Maybe she just likes gangsters.
The only thing we really need to know is where she got the reliquary.
We can bring her in, but she can't know what we're up to.
Maybe we could use French intelligence.
I'm sure they'd be interested in what she's doing.
Not yet.
You bring her in quietly, find out what she knows, and take it from there.
Morning.
- Morning.
- Morning.
- Morning
Marcia Forman is having a field day with this dissent memo.
Marcia Forman is an unhappy woman desperately trying to make herself relevant.
Aren't we all?
Except I'm not a woman.
Sorry. finishing my first round of interviews.
Any leads?
I talked to most of the mid-level Africa desk.
They're in full denial mode.
But I have IT doing an e-mail search for terms that might indicate a grudge against the White House.
Dalton/idiot, McCord/idiot,
- Ouch.
- Dalton/traitor...
- Daisy, keep at it.
Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.
All right, where are we on the sanctions on Angola?
- Anybody...
- Excuse me, Madam Secretary.
I'm sorry to interrupt, but I'm having a little trouble getting my work done while my entire staff is being rounded up for interrogation.
- It was an investigation.
- We have to look into the memo leak.
It's been very destabilizing.
Not to mention criminal.
Fine.
I leaked it.
You want to arrest somebody, arrest me.
Okay, come on.
I am sorry for questioning your staff, but...
Bestilo's put her under house arrest.
Kalanga.
Really?
- When?
- This morning, to protect her security.
And I would love to see this office take half as much interest in a supposedly democratic ally openly stealing an election as you have shown in one leaked document.
Hey, Susan, you got to stop accusing me of not caring.
There are parameters and you know that.
When was the last time you set foot in Southern Africa?
- I...
- But you find time to go to NFL games, and...
I'm so sorry.
I...
You know what?
I-I just give up.
I'd rather work in the private sector and actually get something done.
- Susan...
- Thank you for taking a chance on me.
Madam Secretary, you can consider this my resignation.
Can we talk about this?
Yes.
I'd appreciate it if you let me turn myself in.
I'd rather my staff not see me led out by security.
I know you didn't leak that memo.
That's not what my memoir will say.
And if you think I'm gonna inform on anybody...
No, I don't actually care who leaked it.
I just don't want to lose you.
But you have to understand.
I-I'm playing ten dimensional chess here.
If I could've threatened to cut off agricultural imports and sanction oil when I called Bestilo,
I would've done it.
But we are having an election of our own and, like it or not, we all serve at the pleasure.
And this is exactly the problem with our approach in Africa.
We go in with our studies, and our expertise, and our aid, and we don't even know what we don't know.
Bestilo doesn't care if his people starve.
So, if you really want to get him where he lives, you don't read reports.
You talk to people who know him.
You're right.
So how do we get him where he lives?
Putting your opponent under house arrest is clearly meant to protect your own security, Mr. President, not Kalanga's.
I do not wish to run against a martyr.
But as always, Madam Secretary,
I appreciate your opinion.
It is the United States' opinion.
Therefore, we're demanding the release of Bertilde Kalanga within two hours.
If you do not comply, I'm prepared to impose a travel ban on all Angolan citizens into the United States.
It would be a shame if Amalia Salessu were unable to finish her sophomore year at Stanford.
But, of course, if she's no longer attending school out of the country, maybe she can get to know her half-sister better.
Unless, of course, your daughter Lauana doesn't know she has a half-sister.
I have to wonder, Elizabeth, at President Dalton's boldness in dictating the election procedures of a small African nation when he himself seems to be making up the rules as he goes along.
You have enjoyed many years of generous support and aid from us with little accountability.
But accountability comes in many forms, Damiano.
I regret my years of loyalty mean so little to you.
Our warm relations can be restored if you agree to free Bertilde Kalanga and allow your people a free and fair election.
As your own president follows the dictates of democracy, so shall I.
That seemed a little ominous.
Trust me, that's as close to a checkmate as you're gonna get.
He's shaking.
Well, let's see if an illegitimate daughter will have any effect.
Oh, brilliant.
Finally come round to real tea.
Trying.
Kind of makes my teeth squeak.
Oh, well, that's because it's actual tea, not colored water.
Oh, leave the bag in, woman.
Have I taught you nothing?
I am incorrigible.
I, uh, I heard you say that to your mother when you thought I was out of the room.
Oh... dear.
Of course, I-I had made the scandalous error of pouring the milk after the tea.
I'm sorry I said that.
I don't think that.
I actually find you quite corrigible.
The whole summer, um, I-I felt like... the idiot American girl who doesn't know how to drink tea and doesn't have the right shoes.
That's not how I see you at all.
Why would anyone pour the milk before the tea?
It doesn't make any sense, you can't tell how strong it is.
I looked it up.
George Orwell is with me on this.
God, I hate England.
I'm right there with you.
It brings out the absolute worst in me.
I'm sorry.
Honestly, I mean, the thought of going back there kind of gives me a panic attack.
Well, then let's not.
Really?
I'm miserable without you.
I love the States.
You love the States.
Let's live in the States.
But what about your fellowship?
Please, if a cat can be both alive and dead simultaneously,
I'm sure I can find another fellowship in theoretical physics.
Probably only makes sense to another physicist.
Um, the important thing is that we are our best selves to each other.
Always.
All right.
Keep talking physics to me.
Yeah?
No, don't.
We get the archeologist?
We just brought her in, but she's not talking yet.
Ask her about the statues.
Those are the St. Gabriel statues.
She's dealing with Hizb Al-Shahid.
And the best part is, they haven't seen her.
Right, so, we pick her up, we let her think she's being held by French intelligence.
We'll find an agent who can pass for her, set up a meeting to buy one of these statues, and boom, we have a direct line to Hizb Al-Shahid in Algeria.
Except these guys go through couriers because they can't meet with women.
So, all we have to do is find an agent who looks like this archaeologist, who speaks perfect French, and then somehow convince these extremists that they should violate their religion and meet her face-to-face so she can set up the op.
But, yeah, once we do all that, it's like you said, "Boom."
Good morning, Madam Secretary.
Not while I'm still reading about the dissent memo.
We just got word that Bertilde Kalanga was released from house arrest in Angola.
Hope that helps.
It does.
When do the polls open?
About 16 hours.
Uh, Assistant Secretary Thompson is here, presumably to share the diplomatic equivalent of a high five.
Susan, I just heard.
Bestilo released Kalanga.
He also shut down all Internet service in Angola.
He cannot stop suppressing freedom of speech, can he?
It's worse than that.
I just got word from the embassy, military and police are surrounding poll stations as we speak.
What is he doing?
Suppressing voters with no way for anyone to see what he's up to until it's too late.
Won't the press expose him?
- No, they do whatever he tells them to do.
- He controls it.
But he can't control social media.
If the people show each other what he's doing, he knows they'll rise up.
Same reason Mubarak shut down Internet during the Arab Spring.
Said it was for maintenance.
Maintenance of the status quo.
I thought we were getting through to him.
We should initiate a travel ban.
Threaten to cut off food, even if we can't do it.
No, we-we can't make threats if we we're not willing to follow through on them.
It's like you said, what does he care if his people starve?
Unfortunately, this is the position we've put Angolans in by making them dependent on our food supply.
What about U.N. forces?
Hang on.
You're absolutely right.
Subsidized agriculture was the wrong idea.
We have to let them harvest their own crops, right?
Blake!
Who did you say sent you?
I represent a buyer from Bastia, Lucas Hervé.
Why doesn't he come himself?
He's a businessman.
He needs to be discreet.
So he sends an archaeologist who deals in the black market?
You're pretty high risk.
I have connections to passionate collectors from many different worlds.
Did the reliquary contain the relics of St. Augustine?
It was only the outside the buyer was interested in.
Sounds like you're covering.
That's something an archaeologist would know.
But not something that HS would care about.
Where are you from?
Paris.
18th arrondissement.
Then why does your accent sound southern?
My mother is from Marseille.
I spent my summers there growing up.
I lived with my grandmother.
You just gave us three ways to pull you apart when you just needed to give us one.
Of course.
Ask me again.
I think we got enough.
Great work, Cecile.
Very impressive.
Thanks for coming in.
Well, she looks like our archaeologist.
Her French is perfect.
She's too green.
I know from when Elizabeth was starting out, you want an agent with something to prove.
She can do it.
She'll be sitting face-to-face with members of Hizb Al-Shahid.
It's too important to go with an agent because she reminds you of your wife.
It's too important not to.
Of course.
Yes, I promise.
Okay, Mum.
Yeah, bye, bye, bye, bye.
Hey, I think I found a really cool place in Kingsman Park.
Oh, sorry, I'm completely late for my interview.
And this public transport app is utter rubbish.
- Sorry, um...
- Bad phone call?
Yeah.
Apparently my father is flummoxed that I've thrown away my career, and he's decided to cut me off.
Not that I mind that too much.
I've always hated the way he dangles the inheritance to keep us all in line.
Quite happy to step out of that mini colonialist drama.
How do you not know where George Washington University is?
I'm confused...
I thought your parents were academics.
Yeah, well, they can afford to be, thanks to Mum's title and all that.
Your mother has a title?
Yes.
Lady Sutherland.
Dad just married in, but it doesn't stop him from using it for all it's worth.
I'm sorry, how did I not know any of this?
Could it be the accent?
I actually worked really hard on it.
Okay, look, you'd have hated it.
The country manor in the Cotswolds is basically just a farm with glowering portraits.
The chateau in Provence is a little bit more fun, but I think my sister will have us over for visits so she can just lord it over me.
- Oh, I have to go.
I really have to go.
- Jareth, stop.
Is your father right?
Is this a huge mistake?
It's too late now.
The Brexit vote is in, and there's no turning back.
- So I'll talk to you later.
Mwah!
- Wh...
I really have to go.
Scott, thank you so much for taking the time.
Where you calling me from, 2012?
Super Mario had more pixels.
You guys gotta let me help you out.
Well, I'm...
I'm glad you're in a charitable mood because I've got a... a proposition.
Do you remember saying that if you wanted to, you could extend free Internet access to all of Southern Africa?
By piggybacking off one network, yeah.
I might have overstated the reach.
If I can make a deal with Zambia, do you think you could set up a makeshift network in Angola in...
Well, in the next 12 hours?
Well, I assume this is a tax-free situation we're talking about... no OTTs.
Well... that's the thing.
Um, this network you're setting up will only exist for 24 hours.
Just enough time for Angola to elect its next president in a free and fair election.
After that, you'd have to pay whatever taxes Angola wants.
But if the people's candidate wins, I'm pretty sure we can discourage state-run telecoms
- Here you go.
- all together.
Well, I like the sound of that.
Good, because you'll be helping me do that by sending in a team to train Angolans to build their own private telecom networks... for free.
The way it should be.
However, I-I do have to tell you that if Bertilde Kalanga doesn't win today, then, well, both of us are probably never gonna work in Angola again.
Why would I agree to this?
Because you want to build democracy.
And because, if your company, KronicDM, is the force behind an Internet-led revolution that leads Angola to expose a corrupt regime and elect its first female president, that's gonna make a really kickass Super Bowl commercial.
Huh.
Yup.
Ballot-stuffing in Benguela.
I've got it on a live feed.
I've got somebody facing down a line of military trucks trying to block the poll access.
Yeah, and a bunch of people joining him.
It's like a flash mob without all the dancing.
Well, the news cycle has shifted from the leaked memo.
Thank you, KronicDM.
Thank the Angolans.
They're the ones putting their lives at risk to expose him.
Yes.
All right, that was the embassy.
So far, everything seems calm in Luanda.
Let's hope the eyes of the world are enough to keep Bestilo from lashing out.
Hey, Dad.
Hey.
Where's Jareth?
He's out with friends.
I was at the library.
Want to watch the Angolan election with me?
- First woman president.
- Kalanga won?
Not yet.
Here.
It's vegan.
Mom told me about the whole "I hate England" crisis.
Yeah, well, it's been replaced by the "Jareth is losing out on his inheritance if he stays here" crisis.
- They're disinheriting him?
- Yeah.
Wow, that's extreme.
It also might be because he's marrying someone who doesn't know how to pour tea, but I didn't ask.
Well, even if they cut him off, they're still gonna be your in-laws, so you guys gotta work that out.
How is Jareth doing?
Great.
Supposedly.
Couldn't be happier about being liberated from the tyranny of title and property.
But he's conflicted.
I know he is.
Especially about leaving Oxford.
Isn't this where you give me the wise counsel of experience?
Sorry, I got nothin' except welcome to marriage.
Huge, important life decisions... with unexpected consequences, all taken on a leap of faith.
What if we stay, and he ends up resenting me for losing everything?
Oh, honey, he will.
A-at some point.
And you guys will work through it.
Or not.
That can happen, too.
That's it?
What about the, you know, if you love each other, you can make it through anything?
You know what my dad said to me the night before I got married?
"Marriage is the nicest way to confront your own inadequacies on a daily basis"
You should write that in a song.
Huh.
It's also the greatest journey you'll ever go on.
And you get to go on it with your best friend.
When are they gonna call this?
I definitely don't have time for Bush v. Gore.
My wife's gonna kill me as it is.
If they haven't called it, he hasn't stolen it.
Well, still no word from the embassy, but the Bureau of African Affairs sent over doughnuts.
Suck-ups!
Well, I am not above a suck-up doughnut.
Oh, glazed.
Sorry about the investigation.
Are you offering me my own department's doughnut as an apology?
Yep.
Let's just say it's more of a thank you than an apology.
Releasing the dissent memo, whoever released it...
I'm sorry it was necessary.
They haven't wrapped this thing up yet?
Still waiting.
May I interest you in a doughnut?
No, thanks.
- Where's the, uh, Secretary?
- We did it!
- Oh, Kalanga won!
- Yes, we did it!
Look at that!
And you didn't even have to use agriculture.
All I had to do was work with the people.
I'd like to see the New York Times hold out on us now.
Oh, Russ, don't be so sentimental!
Just stopped by to let you know we're on the ballot in Ohio.
Not that you're campaigning.
Oh, this day is full of wonders.
True that.
Actually, I'll, uh...
I'll have a sprinkles.
You should fly in for the inauguration.
It's good optics.
Um, I may fit that in my schedule.
Will you join me?
Hey, guys, check it out.
Oh, wow.
It's taking too long.
We should have put a wire on her.
That's her.
She's alone.
That's good.
Cecile, all clear?
They bought it.
And they're going to let me appraise the statues in Algeria.
We meet sometime next week.
That's fantastic.
Good work.
Get back to base.
Did we set a pick-up?
This is Black Dog Station.
Who the hell just took our agent?
This morning's bombing in Rome is more than just a brutal attack on one of the most beautiful cities in the world.
This is a threat which will be answered.
Governor, Governor, you've said that as president, you would increase surveillance of Muslim Americans...
Whoa, whoa.
First of all, no group has claimed responsibility yet for the bombing at Stazione Triumfale in Rome.
And I would never suggest infringing on the rights
- of America citizens, ever.
- Yeah?
He doesn't suggest it.
He wants to legislate it.
But if an attack does occur...
Nice suit, though.
His staff's definitely working overtime.
They've pulled him off the campaign trail so he can keep running around showing off his new global concern.
No mention of the bombing in Angola, I notice.
Twice as many dead as in Rome.
But if the press doesn't mention it, why should he?
Of course, this means that I have to pull Conrad off the trail, too.
Right after that China speech last week got us a two point bump in the polls.
But we still have an election to pull out of thin air.
I thought it was... less than a total long shot, which...
I took to be boundless optimism coming from you.
New York Times is about to endorse us, which should reassure the centrists.
And we are making progress getting those sore loser laws changed to get him on the ballot in the states we missed in the primaries.
I'm sensing an Eeyore footnote.
Minnesota and Ohio are holdouts.
If we don't get Dalton on the ballot in those two, we have no hope of keeping Evans or Reynolds from getting to 270, at which point, it's game over.
We've got the team on Minnesota, but I need your help.
- I can't campaign, you know...
- With Ohio, it's...
- I can't campaign!
- it's not campaigning!
We-we just need somebody high profile to take Dalton's place in an NFL pre-game interview.
Slip in something about getting on the ballot, and go have dinner with some state senators.
How is wining and dining state senators
- not campaigning?
- Because I have a room full of lawyers, telling me that isn't!
We are in this ridiculous situation 'cause of your idea to turn our backs on the party and do an independent run.
Be right back.
Assistant Secretary Thompson, I am so sorry
I didn't reach you before you came all the way up here.
The attack in Rome has completely hijacked her schedule...
That was an unfortunate verb choice.
She's not in?
Emergency conference at the White House.
But I will give that
- to her as soon as she returns.
- Excuse me.
Hi, Louise, what are we cancelling?
Yeah, that should be fine, um Yes.
I'll have to double-check that.
Death toll now at 42, with more injured in a suicide bombing...
Hizb Al-Shahid just took credit for the bombing in Rome.
I heard.
Do we believe it?
Well, the sources seem credible.
So, now they're moving from Algeria into Europe.
DEA came through with some Intel on sales of antiquities from North Africa.
See if any of these look like they were looted from St. Gabriel's Monastery before HS blew it up.
Stones from the tomb of the Christian woman in Tipaza.
Not too far from the monastery.
Stones, though; very hard to prove authenticity.
What's this one?
"Reliquary of St. Augustine from the Basilica in Annaba"
Looks like St. Augustine has the same taste as a Corsican drug lord.
Trust me, this is not St. Augustine style.
This is the Colonial French feeling guilty.
See, when France took over Algeria, they felt bad because none of Augustine's remains were in Annaba, his hometown, so they made this reliquary to return his arm bone to the basilica.
Where's Annaba?
Northeastern Algeria.
Part of the ancient city of Hippo Regius.
Maybe HS sacked that place, too?
There's plenty there worth looting.
But I didn't think they'd gotten that far north.
Just like we didn't think they were in Rome.
Let's check with DEA.
See if we can trace this back to the seller.
Susan.
I'm sorry to disrupt your schedule, Madam Secretary.
N-No, no, no.
I'm-I'm sorry to keep you waiting.
The...fallout from Rome has been getting all the attention.
- You know how that goes.
- I do.
So...
The bombing in Luanda, that was a travesty.
How's Kalanga?
She's injured, but alive, thank God.
A separatist group is taking credit.
I-I'm really sorry that I haven't been able to respond, but I'll issue a statement condemning the... the group's actions in the... strongest terms.
With all respect, Madam Secretary, the situation in Angola has gone well beyond a statement of condemnation.
Which is why I'm here.
A memo of dissent?
Signed by your entire African Affairs Bureau.
Specifically objecting to our policies in Angola.
For 30 years, President Bestilo has enjoyed generous trade agreements with the United States, a wealth of subsidies, and a blind eye to his increasing corruption
- and cronyism.
- Are you suggesting that President Bestilo was behind the attack?
I'm saying that this administration's deafening silence after an attack that killed twice as many people as that bombing in Rome...
It's just the latest example of ongoing indifference.
So, dissent memo?
Bestilo put a ban on all public assembly this morning, supposedly to protect the people.
But it is obvious he's using this bombing as a cover to silence his opponent.
The people want Kalanga and he knows it.
He's stealing this election.
I can't ask my staff to stand by silently while the administration does nothing.
I will do everything in my power
- to make our deep displeasure known.
- No.
Not another "urge, encourage, concern" phone call.
This needs action, Elizabeth.
If Bestilo is allowed to snuff out a once-in-a-generation candidate, and the rest of the world shrugs 'cause nobody went to Luanda on a honeymoon, that's an African story I'm tired of telling.
We've got some changes to note in the secretary's schedule.
The Emissions and Deforestation Conference will be postponed.
Thank you.
And we've added the NFL Diplomacy Initiative in Cleveland, ma'am.
Yeah, the... president is stepping off the campaign trail.
I'm just gonna fill in.
As in, campaigning?
No, no.
It-it's just a little... pre-game interview about... football and diplomacy.
Yeah.
Well, Russell Jackson insists it's legal.
Hey, wait.
Who's doing the interview?
James Brown.
- I thought he was dead.
- No.
That would be, fellow diplomat and ambassador of soul, James Brown.
This would be
CBS Sportscaster James Brown.
J.B.!
And what exactly is it that Russell Jackson would like you to say?
Legally.
...I think the non-campaigning version of "Please put President Dalton on the ballot in Ohio."
Hey!
What about this?
Um, Dalton's not on the ballot because of the sore loser law, right?
Just recently, the NFL changed the extra point rule...
Yeah, too many kickers were making it, so they moved it back to the 15 yard line.
Right, and just as the NFL can change the rules, to make the game fair and competitive...
So Ohio can reexamine its policy in this historically unprecedented third party run.
- Yes!
- That's good.
I like that.
I like that......
G-Give more of those.
Okay, moving on.
Yes, sorry.
We need to talk about the bombing in Angola.
It's awful.
Kalanga survive?
Yeah, with injuries.
83 others were not as lucky.
But President Bestilo is using the attack to suppress his opponent, and this morning,
I received a dissent memo from the Bureau of African Affairs, urging a stronger response.
Um, can I see it?
It's an understandable frustration at our ongoing cooperation with an increasingly corrupt regime.
What I need... are some possible sanctions I can threaten to get President Bestilo to toe the line.
- Cut off aide?
- Or agricultural imports.
I mean, they get a ton of poultry and grain from us.
Not sure how American farmers are gonna feel about that.
Not as bad as the Angolans if we cut off their food supply.
- We'll draw up some talking points.
- Thank you.
Hey!
Louise said I could catch you.
Um, could we just slow this down to a jog, please?
We need to talk about Angola.
Why?
The bomb there yesterday.
I don't know if you heard, more dead than in Rome.
Yeah?
Could you do me a favor, and just pretend to listen to me?
Because I just got a dissent memo from my entire African Affairs Bureau, convinced that this administration doesn't know or care that Angola's presidential election is being stolen
- in broad daylight.
- I'm a little preoccupied with another election at the moment.
Why are we still talking about this?
Because I want to remind President Bestilo that he is running a democracy.
So, I would like to threaten to cut our agricultural exports and I just want to make sure that I'm not lighting anybody's hair on fire.
- Do whatever you need to do.
- Okay.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Wait, what?
!
You can't do that!
Why?
Were you not listening this morning?
We have two major agricultural states...
Ohio, Minnesota... where we're fighting for our lives.
Y-Y-You expect me to tell them t-t-that we're just cutting off their, what, fifth biggest importer of poultry in the world?
I knew you listen to me!
Give me a week to get this resolved.
Then you can turn all the screws you want.
I don't have a week.
The election is in four days.
And if Bestilo wins another term, that's one more African nation we lose to an autocratic leader.
Here's a novel idea: stick to the Prime Directive.
Let democracy take its course... without U.S. interference.
Really?
A Star Trek reference?
I deeply appreciate your compassion, Madam Secretary,
But Angola is strong.
We will endure.
I'm sure you will, Mr. President.
However, I am concerned that your ban on public gatherings may interfere with the democratic process.
It is for the safety of my people.
I refuse to make them a target again.
Yes, but, Mr. President...
"Damiano," please.
I just want to remind you that in order to continue our support of Angola, we need to know that you will support the will of the people.
I find these conversations so inspiring.
Thank you, Madam Secretary.
Good luck with your own election.
It seems you're going to need it.
Urge, encourage... and concern.
Did I leave something out?
Mollify and assuage?
Are you kidding me?
Who wrote these talking points?
The Browns have got way bigger problems thank finding a go-to receiver on third down.
Can I just say how adorable it is that this is the most opinionated you've been about my job in, like, ever?
Well, it's better than reading that FBI report.
I mean, 58 pages to say they still can't find whoever's hacking our house and stalking our entire family?
Yes, I know, I know.
On the other hand, no new incidents.
See?
Staying positive, trusting the system.
Well, you're doing better than I am.
You have a rough day?
I got a dissent memo on Angola.
Is that like when a student files an appeal 'cause they don't like their grade?
It's an anonymous communication channel to allow anyone at the State Department to formally oppose foreign policy they don't agree with.
So...
I got the bad grade.
That attack in Luanda was rough.
Okay, can you just tell me that
I do a great job at other things.
- I...
Right now, I just need to hear...
- Hey, hey, hey.
Come on, come on.
You are the very best student in the whole State Department.
And you know... what I give to my best students.
- Wait...
- What?
God!
- No, no, no, no.
- No, no, no.
It's not...
It was getting weird anyway.
I just wanted to tell you that Jareth is coming for a visit.
Well, that's great.
When does he get here?
Wednesday, actually.
Kinda last-minute.
Well, I'll say, but what a great surprise.
Yeah, it's... it's okay if he stays here?
- Yeah, of course.
- Yes.
Sure.
Okay, thank you.
- Yes!
I'm so excited.
- Yay.
Sweetie, that's great.
So are we!
It's okay that he stays here, right?
Of course, I love that kid.
No, I mean, you know, she's got that tiny little twin bed with the girly bedspread.
You think that'd be comfortable?
Well, I think they'll get comfortable.
Really?
Well, I remember we got pretty comfortable with your...
Okay, but we didn't have Will in the next room with a very thin wall.
- God, Jason.
- Yeah.
- Will you say something to her?
- Yes.
- I do, I will, I'll talk to her, yeah.
- Just to be quiet.
Yes, Daisy, what's up?
Ma'am, I just got a heads up from a guy at the Post.
They have a copy of the dissent memo, and they're about to run it.
Well, that's a disaster.
Did he...
Did he say how he got it?
I couldn't get it out of him, and it's too late to kill it...
I tried.
Okay, well, I want to know who leaked it, so you do whatever you have to, okay?
Yes, ma'am.
And, listen, for what it's worth, the news cycle is still on the attack in Rome.
We might be okay.
Thanks, Daisy.
What the hell is this about a dissent memo?
Now, tell me Madam Secretary, when are we going to see
NFL football in, say, France?
Well, that... that's a...
that's a tricky question.
I think, every country loves its game just as much as we love ours.
And change is hard.
1906, football fans were scandalized by the invention of the forward pass, and now it's a definitive signature of the game.
So rules do need to evolve.
Now, President Dalton is looking to make a few changed in the upcoming election, too, isn't that right?
Well, I'm...
I'm happy that you brought that up.
...because as much as President Dalton is supported and trusted by the American people, certain rules will need to evolve to accommodate this historic third-party run.
Well, with that being said, we're gonna take a little break, but, Secretary McCord, thank you again
- for taking the time.
- It's my pleasure.
Go, Browns!
Is that Russell Jackson?
Julius!
Well, look at us.
Even without the support of our key donor, we somehow manage to stay in the game.
I love it when he stays in sales mode.
Madam Secretary, I wanted to introduce you to a friend of mine.
Secretary McCord, Scott Goodman, KronicDM.
My son loves your messaging app.
He thinks I don't know what the name means.
Mom's hip.
Well, I'm glad he's hooked in.
I was wondering, could I grab a minute?
Sure.
How's it going with Sam Evans?
You ready to admit you backed the wrong horse?
Let's just say I haven't placed any bets yet.
I saw that story about your staff throwing a flags on the play in Africa.
The dissent memo, yes.
Yeah, I gotta tell you, from a tech point of view, we're pretty frustrated, too.
We're trying to get KronicDM going in Southern Africa, but these countries are killing us with these OTT taxes.
A fee to use their telecom services, right?
- Over-the-top tax?
- Yes, even the name...
"over-the-top"
Most Africans aren't online.
They just... they have phones.
So we're how they're staying connected, but these state-owned telecom services are strangling us with these fees.
To be fair, your app is using their services, right?
So shouldn't they ask you to help pay for it?
Come on, Secretary.
I mean, they could privatize telecom, and the whole economy would benefit.
But then they wouldn't be able to monitor everything that their citizens are saying, or turn it off whenever they want to.
I mean, state-owned telecom, it's bad for democracy, and it's bad for business.
I understand your frustration, but the thing about emerging economies, Scott, is that they have to be allowed to do just that... emerge.
It's... it's a process.
If I wanted to, right now,
I could cut a deal with one country and piggyback one network across most of Southern Africa for free, the way it should be.
But I'm not doing that 'cause I'm hoping my elected
- officials are gonna do their job...
- Appointed.
I'm afraid that's all the time the secretary has.
Gosh, Scott, too bad.
Thanks so much.
I haven't been mansplained that hard since Craig Sterling was in office.
Good job on the interview.
Too bad it won't save us.
What do you mean?
We just got word the Times is holding back on the endorsement.
They want to let this dissent memo play out first.
Just long enough so it won't do us any good.
Hey, you want some of this?
I don't even know what it is.
- It's mushroom soufflé.
- Don't you want to heat that up?
No, I'm barely tasting it anyway.
So, Jareth tomorrow.
That's exciting.
Yep.
You know, Dad and I are really happy that he's gonna stay with us, but maybe we should just talk about one thing.
What, the fact that if we move to England
I might end up killing myself?
What?
Yeah.
Sweetheart... what happened?
The whole summer was awful.
His friends, his family.
The stupid weather.
Wait, you-you've been home almost a month.
Why didn't you say something?
Denial?
I don't know.
It was embarrassing.
I mean...
- you guys were so happy for me.
- Well...
And it was supposed to be the best summer of my life.
Instead, I turned into this total baby.
Leaving dinner parties to go cry in the bathroom.
Well, a little culture shock is to be expected.
It was more like culture electrocution.
Well, how's Jareth?
That was the worst part.
He was kind of a totally different person, too.
I mean, like snobby, and he cared what school everybody went to.
He was, like, turning away from me if I made the wrong joke.
Sounds like you guys definitely have some stuff to talk about.
I don't want you to think he's a bad person.
He's just...
British, it turns out.
Now, but, Stevie, you have to be straight with him.
You can't pretend you're fine when you're not.
That's not how marriage works.
I know.
I just...
I don't know how he's gonna take it.
All right, here's the part of the DEA surveillance footage we need.
Here she is coming into the guy's house to make the sale.
It's the same person.
What's an antiquities expert at a history museum doing selling stolen treasures to Corsican drug lords?
There's nothing in her background to support it.
I don't know.
Maybe she needs the money.
Maybe she just likes gangsters.
The only thing we really need to know is where she got the reliquary.
We can bring her in, but she can't know what we're up to.
Maybe we could use French intelligence.
I'm sure they'd be interested in what she's doing.
Not yet.
You bring her in quietly, find out what she knows, and take it from there.
Morning.
- Morning.
- Morning.
- Morning
Marcia Forman is having a field day with this dissent memo.
Marcia Forman is an unhappy woman desperately trying to make herself relevant.
Aren't we all?
Except I'm not a woman.
Sorry. finishing my first round of interviews.
Any leads?
I talked to most of the mid-level Africa desk.
They're in full denial mode.
But I have IT doing an e-mail search for terms that might indicate a grudge against the White House.
Dalton/idiot, McCord/idiot,
- Ouch.
- Dalton/traitor...
Daisy, keep at it.
Thank you.
All right, where are we on the sanctions on Angola?
- Anybody...
- Excuse me, Madam Secretary.
I'm sorry to interrupt, but I'm having a little trouble getting my work done while my entire staff is being rounded up for interrogation.
- It was an investigation.
- We have to look into the memo leak.
It's been very destabilizing.
Not to mention criminal.
Fine.
I leaked it.
You want to arrest somebody, arrest me.
Okay, come on.
I am sorry for questioning your staff, but...
Bestilo's put her under house arrest.
Kalanga.
Really?
- When?
- This morning, to protect her security.
And I would love to see this office take half as much interest in a supposedly democratic ally openly stealing an election as you have shown in one leaked document.
Hey, Susan, you got to stop accusing me of not caring.
There are parameters and you know that.
When was the last time you set foot in Southern Africa?
- I...
- But you find time to go to NFL games, and...
I'm so sorry.
I...
You know what?
I-I just give up.
I'd rather work in the private sector and actually get something done.
- Susan...
- Thank you for taking a chance on me.
Madam Secretary, you can consider this my resignation.
Can we talk about this?
Yes.
I'd appreciate it if you let me turn myself in.
I'd rather my staff not see me led out by security.
I know you didn't leak that memo.
That's not what my memoir will say.
And if you think I'm gonna inform on anybody...
No, I don't actually care who leaked it.
I just don't want to lose you.
But you have to understand.
I-I'm playing ten dimensional chess here.
If I could've threatened to cut off agricultural imports and sanction oil when I called Bestilo,
I would've done it.
But we are having an election of our own and, like it or not, we all serve at the pleasure.
And this is exactly the problem with our approach in Africa.
We go in with our studies, and our expertise, and our aid, and we don't even know what we don't know.
Bestilo doesn't care if his people starve.
So, if you really want to get him where he lives, you don't read reports.
You talk to people who know him.
You're right.
So how do we get him where he lives?
Putting your opponent under house arrest is clearly meant to protect your own security, Mr. President, not Kalanga's.
I do not wish to run against a martyr.
But as always, Madam Secretary,
I appreciate your opinion.
It is the United States' opinion.
Therefore, we're demanding the release of Bertilde Kalanga within two hours.
If you do not comply, I'm prepared to impose a travel ban on all Angolan citizens into the United States.
It would be a shame if Amalia Salessu were unable to finish her sophomore year at Stanford.
But, of course, if she's no longer attending school out of the country, maybe she can get to know her half-sister better.
Unless, of course, your daughter Lauana doesn't know she has a half-sister.
I have to wonder, Elizabeth, at President Dalton's boldness in dictating the election procedures of a small African nation when he himself seems to be making up the rules as he goes along.
You have enjoyed many years of generous support and aid from us with little accountability.
But accountability comes in many forms, Damiano.
I regret my years of loyalty mean so little to you.
Our warm relations can be restored if you agree to free Bertilde Kalanga and allow your people a free and fair election.
As your own president follows the dictates of democracy, so shall I.
That seemed a little ominous.
Trust me, that's as close to a checkmate as you're gonna get.
He's shaking.
Well, let's see if an illegitimate daughter will have any effect.
Brilliant.
Finally come round to real tea.
Trying.
Kind of makes my teeth squeak.
Well, that's because it's actual tea, not colored water.
Leave the bag in, woman.
Have I taught you nothing?
I am incorrigible.
I, I heard you say that to your mother when you thought I was out of the room.
...dear.
Of course, I-I had made the scandalous error of pouring the milk after the tea.
I'm sorry I said that.
I don't think that.
I actually find you quite corrigible.
The whole summer, um, I-I felt like... the idiot American girl who doesn't know how to drink tea and doesn't have the right shoes.
That's not how I see you at all.
Why would anyone pour the milk before the tea?
It doesn't make any sense, you can't tell how strong it is.
I looked it up.
George Orwell is with me on this.
God, I hate England.
I'm right there with you.
It brings out the absolute worst in me.
I'm sorry.
Honestly, I mean, the thought of going back there kind of gives me a panic attack.
Well, then let's not.
Really?
I'm miserable without you.
I love the States.
You love the States.
Let's live in the States.
But what about your fellowship?
Please, if a cat can be both alive and dead simultaneously,
I'm sure I can find another fellowship in theoretical physics.
Probably only makes sense to another physicist.
Um, the important thing is that we are our best selves to each other.
Always.
All right.
Keep talking physics to me.
Yeah?
No, don't.
We get the archeologist?
We just brought her in, but she's not talking yet.
Ask her about the statues.
Those are the St. Gabriel statues.
She's dealing with Hizb Al-Shahid.
And the best part is, they haven't seen her.
Right, so, we pick her up, we let her think she's being held by French intelligence.
We'll find an agent who can pass for her, set up a meeting to buy one of these statues, and boom, we have a direct line to Hizb Al-Shahid in Algeria.
Except these guys go through couriers because they can't meet with women.
So, all we have to do is find an agent who looks like this archaeologist, who speaks perfect French, and then somehow convince these extremists that they should violate their religion and meet her face-to-face so she can set up the op.
But, yeah, once we do all that, it's like you said, "Boom."
Good morning, Madam Secretary.
Not while I'm still reading about the dissent memo.
We just got word that Bertilde Kalanga was released from house arrest in Angola.
Hope that helps.
It does.
When do the polls open?
About 16 hours.
Assistant Secretary Thompson is here, presumably to share the diplomatic equivalent of a high five.
Susan, I just heard.
Bestilo released Kalanga.
He also shut down all Internet service in Angola.
He cannot stop suppressing freedom of speech, can he?
It's worse than that.
I just got word from the embassy, military and police are surrounding poll stations as we speak.
What is he doing?
Suppressing voters with no way for anyone to see what he's up to until it's too late.
Won't the press expose him?
- No, they do whatever he tells them to do.
- He controls it.
But he can't control social media.
If the people show each other what he's doing, he knows they'll rise up.
Same reason Mubarak shut down Internet during the Arab Spring.
Said it was for maintenance.
Maintenance of the status quo.
I thought we were getting through to him.
We should initiate a travel ban.
Threaten to cut off food, even if we can't do it.
No, we-we can't make threats if we we're not willing to follow through on them.
It's like you said, what does he care if his people starve?
Unfortunately, this is the position we've put Angolans in by making them dependent on our food supply.
What about U.N. forces?
Hang on.
You're absolutely right.
Subsidized agriculture was the wrong idea.
We have to let them harvest their own crops, right?
Blake!
Who did you say sent you?
I represent a buyer from Bastia, Lucas Hervé.
Why doesn't he come himself?
He's a businessman.
He needs to be discreet.
So he sends an archaeologist who deals in the black market?
You're pretty high risk.
I have connections to passionate collectors from many different worlds.
Did the reliquary contain the relics of St. Augustine?
It was only the outside the buyer was interested in.
Sounds like you're covering.
That's something an archaeologist would know.
But not something that HS would care about.
Where are you from?
Paris.
18th arrondissement.
Then why does your accent sound southern?
My mother is from Marseille.
I spent my summers there growing up.
I lived with my grandmother.
You just gave us three ways to pull you apart when you just needed to give us one.
Of course.
Ask me again.
I think we got enough.
Great work, Cecile.
Very impressive.
Thanks for coming in.
Well, she looks like our archaeologist.
Her French is perfect.
She's too green.
I know from when Elizabeth was starting out, you want an agent with something to prove.
She can do it.
She'll be sitting face-to-face with members of Hizb Al-Shahid.
It's too important to go with an agent because she reminds you of your wife.
It's too important not to.
Of course.
Yes, I promise.
Okay, Mum.
Yeah, bye, bye, bye, bye.
Hey, I think I found a really cool place in Kingsman Park.
Sorry, I'm completely late for my interview.
And this public transport app is utter rubbish.
- Sorry, um...
- Bad phone call?
Yeah.
Apparently my father is flummoxed that I've thrown away my career, and he's decided to cut me off.
Not that I mind that too much.
I've always hated the way he dangles the inheritance to keep us all in line.
Quite happy to step out of that mini colonialist drama.
How do you not know where George Washington University is?
I'm confused...
I thought your parents were academics.
Yeah, well, they can afford to be, thanks to Mum's title and all that.
Your mother has a title?
Yes.
Lady Sutherland.
Dad just married in, but it doesn't stop him from using it for all it's worth.
I'm sorry, how did I not know any of this?
Could it be the accent?
I actually worked really hard on it.
Okay, look, you'd have hated it.
The country manor in the Cotswolds is basically just a farm with glowering portraits.
The chateau in Provence is a little bit more fun, but I think my sister will have us over for visits so she can just lord it over me.
- I have to go.
I really have to go.
- Jareth, stop.
Is your father right?
Is this a huge mistake?
It's too late now.
The Brexit vote is in, and there's no turning back.
- So I'll talk to you later.
Mwah!
- Wh...
I really have to go.
Scott, thank you so much for taking the time.
Where you calling me from, 2012?
Super Mario had more pixels.
You guys gotta let me help you out.
Well, I'm...
I'm glad you're in a charitable mood because I've got a... a proposition.
Do you remember saying that if you wanted to, you could extend free Internet access to all of Southern Africa?
By piggybacking off one network, yeah.
I might have overstated the reach.
If I can make a deal with Zambia, do you think you could set up a makeshift network in Angola in...
Well, in the next 12 hours?
Well, I assume this is a tax-free situation we're talking about... no OTTs.
Well... that's the thing.
Um, this network you're setting up will only exist for 24 hours.
Just enough time for Angola to elect its next president in a free and fair election.
After that, you'd have to pay whatever taxes Angola wants.
But if the people's candidate wins, I'm pretty sure we can discourage state-run telecoms
- Here you go.
- all together.
Well, I like the sound of that.
Good, because you'll be helping me do that by sending in a team to train Angolans to build their own private telecom networks... for free.
The way it should be.
However, I-I do have to tell you that if Bertilde Kalanga doesn't win today, then, well, both of us are probably never gonna work in Angola again.
Why would I agree to this?
Because you want to build democracy.
And because, if your company, KronicDM, is the force behind an Internet-led revolution that leads Angola to expose a corrupt regime and elect its first female president, that's gonna make a really kickass Super Bowl commercial.
Yup.
Ballot-stuffing in Benguela.
I've got it on a live feed.
I've got somebody facing down a line of military trucks trying to block the poll access.
Yeah, and a bunch of people joining him.
It's like a flash mob without all the dancing.
Well, the news cycle has shifted from the leaked memo.
Thank you, KronicDM.
Thank the Angolans.
They're the ones putting their lives at risk to expose him.
Yes.
All right, that was the embassy.
So far, everything seems calm in Luanda.
Let's hope the eyes of the world are enough to keep Bestilo from lashing out.
Hey, Dad.
Hey.
Where's Jareth?
He's out with friends.
I was at the library.
Want to watch the Angolan election with me?
- First woman president.
- Kalanga won?
Not yet.
Here.
It's vegan.
Mom told me about the whole "I hate England" crisis.
Yeah, well, it's been replaced by the "Jareth is losing out on his inheritance if he stays here" crisis.
- They're disinheriting him?
- Yeah.
Wow, that's extreme.
It also might be because he's marrying someone who doesn't know how to pour tea, but I didn't ask.
Well, even if they cut him off, they're still gonna be your in-laws, so you guys gotta work that out.
How is Jareth doing?
Great.
Supposedly.
Couldn't be happier about being liberated from the tyranny of title and property.
But he's conflicted.
I know he is.
Especially about leaving Oxford.
Isn't this where you give me the wise counsel of experience?
Sorry, I got nothin' except welcome to marriage.
Huge, important life decisions... with unexpected consequences, all taken on a leap of faith.
What if we stay, and he ends up resenting me for losing everything?
Honey, he will.
A-at some point.
And you guys will work through it.
Or not.
That can happen, too.
That's it?
What about the, you know, if you love each other, you can make it through anything?
You know what my dad said to me the night before I got married?
"Marriage is the nicest way to confront your own inadequacies on a daily basis"
You should write that in a song.
It's also the greatest journey you'll ever go on.
And you get to go on it with your best friend.
When are they gonna call this?
I definitely don't have time for Bush v. Gore.
My wife's gonna kill me as it is.
If they haven't called it, he hasn't stolen it.
Well, still no word from the embassy, but the Bureau of African Affairs sent over doughnuts.
Suck-ups!
Well, I am not above a suck-up doughnut.
Glazed.
Sorry about the investigation.
Are you offering me my own department's doughnut as an apology?
Yep.
Let's just say it's more of a thank you than an apology.
Releasing the dissent memo, whoever released it...
I'm sorry it was necessary.
They haven't wrapped this thing up yet?
Still waiting.
May I interest you in a doughnut?
No, thanks.
- Where's the, Secretary?
- We did it!
- Kalanga won!
- Yes, we did it!
Look at that!
And you didn't even have to use agriculture.
All I had to do was work with the people.
I'd like to see the New York Times hold out on us now.
Russ, don't be so sentimental!
Just stopped by to let you know we're on the ballot in Ohio.
Not that you're campaigning.
This day is full of wonders.
True that.
Actually, I'll...
I'll have a sprinkles.
You should fly in for the inauguration.
It's good optics.
Um, I may fit that in my schedule.
Will you join me?
Hey, guys, check it out.
Wow.
It's taking too long.
We should have put a wire on her.
That's her.
She's alone.
That's good.
Cecile, all clear?
They bought it.
And they're going to let me appraise the statues in Algeria.
We meet sometime next week.
That's fantastic.
Good work.
Get back to base.
Did we set a pick-up?
This is Black Dog Station.
Who the hell just took our agent?
Subtitles by explosiveskull
Too late, called you first.
Whoa.
Whoa?
What do you mean, whoa?
Nothing.
I meant, nothing.
You said "whoa" when you answered my call.
I just, I didn't realize, you just look super different.
I hope that's a good thing.
Yeah, I mean, you're totally...
You grew up too.
What grade are you in?
I'm in your grade, duh.
Right.
How'd you find me?
I was just looking through...
Are you stalking me?
No, no, no, no, I wasn't, I wasn't.
I was just kidding!
T, come on, let's skip the awkwardness.
What's your deal?
My deal?
Yeah, what's your deal?
Well, I guess I'm still stuck in Michigan,
I hate school, and my parents suck.
That's true for like everybody.
Not everybody lives in Michigan.
Har har.
So you still like comic books?
Oh.
Yeah, I guess I do.
That's awesome.
No, it is.
I'm in choir.
They wanted me to join the school musical but you'd have to be there like every night and I'm way too busy, so.
My school's doing this Bye Bye Birdie year.
I was gonna audition but then...
What are you doing tonight?
Nothing.
Just probably playing video games.
Nothing?
It's a Saturday night, you're not going out with your friends?
I would, but they just couldn't tonight.
Come on, T, shake it up.
You gotta live a little.
Yeah.
I usually...
Hey, T, you know what, I gotta go.
My friend's gonna be here in like a minute and if I don't get downstairs, my dad's gonna get to her and he gets all weird and flirty, so...
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Can we talk again sometime?
I don't know, I've got a killer schedule.
Okay, totally.
You know, I was just thinking...
Hey, T, you know what?
She's actually here, I gotta go.
Bye.
Bye.
Teel!
Hi, Teel!
This is Sophie.
Oh, oh, no, Sophie, no.
We ignore Sophie right now.
No, don't ignore me!
Here, take a jello shot.
Stop, stop, no.
Okay, you drink it then.
No, Sophie, no.
They're non-alcoholic.
Okay, fine.
I promise!
Fine, okay.
I promise.
Okay, I'm putting this down.
I thought that you might be bored tonight so I brought you to Becky's party.
Oh yeah.
Looks like fun.
What?
Seems fun.
Oh, we're gonna be here until, like, super late.
Okay, so here's the deal.
I've been flirting with Cole McCovey all night but apparently he would rather play with Ella.
Ping pong, of all things.
What's ping pong?
What?
What's ping pong?
Like, ping pong, table tennis?
You know, the game?
Oh, you actually mean, like, ping pong.
Okay, so here's Cole.
Isn't he cute?
I guess.
And here's Ella.
I do not like her at all.
So I wanted Sophie's help with this but she, as you can see, is gone.
So I turn to you, okay?
See this guy over here?
His name is John Dixon but we call him Dix because he literally is, you know, with that.
Right.
So if I can get him to kiss me in front of Cole, maybe I can make Cole jealous and have him want to play ping pong with me.
What do you think?
It doesn't sound like the best...
I'll take that as a yes.
Okay, just wait here.
Hey, Dix.
Don't call me that.
What you playing?
What are you playing?
Hey, I was just about to beat my high score!
Candy Crush.
High score?
Would you rather score on this or score with me?
I...
Whoa, hey.
You guys, why don't you get a room?
Hey, hey, horndog!
T!
Get the hell off of her!
You watching us, you little perv?
Hey!
Stop!
Oh, you are such a bitch!
Oh my god, oh my god!
Mad...
Mad.
Sophie!
Mad...
Teel, hey!
Take a look!
Come on!
♪ Your life is like Skyrim
♪ An endless quest of solitude
♪ Oh, you beat Angry Birds
♪ You're not a gamer 'cause you battle your friends
♪ With words
T, I was supposed to call you.
Are you okay?
Yeah, the party was insane.
That Dix guy is a dick.
Right?
Don't worry, my friends pushed him into the pool too and he tried to dunk me, but I was on the swim team, so...
It was good because I had beer all over my shirt, so I totally rinsed it out and Cole came out to watch.
I guess as long as Cole was there.
Isn't it like 4:30 your time?
Yeah, but I'm up, so whatever.
You're a night owl.
Don't you have a curfew?
11:30.
But my dad goes to bed at, like, 10, so.
He doesn't check up on you?
No.
He trusts me.
I'm totally trustworthy.
Yeah, I can see that.
T, it's a party.
It's all part of the fun, you gotta loosen up if you want friends.
I have friends.
I have, like, tons of friends.
I'm just saying, it doesn't seem like you go out that much.
No, my friends and I go out all the time, they just couldn't tonight.
Okay.
Besides, you know, sometimes I like having a night to myself every once in a while.
Sometimes it's nice to just decompress, do some gaming, listen to some music.
Yeah, no, I get it.
I just...
Wait, I think I hear my dad.
Bye.
My dad took my phone.
What, why?
I'm grounded for two weeks.
He found out that I missed curfew.
How?
He came in here, like, at midnight and I guess I wasn't in here, obviously.
WTF, this is my room.
That's a total invasion of privacy.
I don't want him in here touching my stuff, sniffing through my underwear drawer.
Okay.
Wait, I thought he goes to bed at, like, 10.
Yeah, usually.
But lately he's all freaked out because he's retiring in a few weeks.
He just roams the halls drinking nightcaps.
What's he freaked out for though?
'Cause isn't that good news?
You'd think.
But he, like, doesn't know what to do with himself now, so.
What about your mom?
My mom died seven years ago, so she's not much help.
Oh my god, I'm so sorry.
I didn't know.
Whatever.
I'm over it, but my dad needs to find a new hobby because this is getting ridiculous.
Sugar free.
Wait, if you're grounded, then how are you talking to me?
Oh, he didn't take my computer.
He thinks I'm doing homework on it, which is you.
So I guess I'll be doing you every day after school.
Whoa.
Mind out of the gutter, little man.
You're the one who said it.
Girls are allowed to have their mind in the gutter.
It's sexy.
When guys do it, it's just, it's gross.
I wasn't aware of that rule.
Stick with me.
You'll learn.
Hey, sweetie?
Hon, you've been up here quite a while.
You been playing video games?
What?
No, I'm talking to my friend Madison.
Hon, please don't.
What?
I'm telling the truth!
You know what Dr. Thomas said about you making things up.
Hi, Mrs. Johnson!
Oh my, I'm sorry I didn't realize.
Madison Daniels, do you remember me?
I used to live down the street from you.
Madison, what a surprise.
Madison Daniels, of course I remember.
You didn't tell me you were talking to Madison Daniels.
Yeah, actually, Mom, I did.
Well, that's great, that is just great!
I won't interrupt you.
Nice to see you again.
You too, Mrs. Johnson.
Madison Daniels, huh.
See?
My parents suck.
She seems nice.
You have no idea.
You might think that your parents suck, but that is just a teenage syndrome that distorts your perception, when in actual scientifical fact, they are perfectly legit.
Who says I'm being scientific about it?
No, I'm just saying, I need more proof before I accept your assertion.
What are you, a lawyer?
I'm gonna be.
So pony up.
Okay.
My parents, every year, make me try out for sports, even though I don't have any talent or inclination or even the slightest interest in the jock arts.
Eh, wrong answer.
They're just trying to make sure that you're well-rounded.
Which is actually the distinctive trait of a loving parent.
Last year, I auditioned, or tried out for the track team and I deliberately ran as slow as I could so that I would get cut from the team.
Totally reasonable.
Right, but then my mom read the school guidelines and she discovered that technically the coach isn't allowed to cut anybody from the team.
It's a little known secret.
So she forced him to let me run.
It was like a whole to-do at my school and then finally we came up with this shoddy compromise that kept me on the team as the mascot.
What's the mascot?
Oh no!
Yeah.
So now I'm at all the track meets, which no one even goes to in the first place, and I'm stuck wearing this ratty old costume that hasn't seen the light of day since like 1992.
I think they just wanted me to kind of get involved and make friends, but it really just made me a target for the coach's kid who kept kicking me in the shins.
Okay, although misguided, it came out of concern for your well-being.
They tried to get me to go out for football this year,
Mad, and I had to pretty convincingly sprain an ankle to get out of that.
Yes, okay, all dads want their kids to play sports.
That's like a primal instinct from our hunter-gatherer days.
It's not my dad, it's my mom.
Unexpected.
Yeah, it's like she's on this mission to keep me from becoming...
A dweeb?
Thanks.
You'll survive.
It gets worse.
Always.
You remember how I said I wanted to audition for Bye Bye Birdie?
You did?
Yeah, I told you that the first night we talked.
Yeah, yeah.
Bye Bye, yeah.
Right.
Well, I had to miss the auditions because my mom decided we should take a spontaneous trip to visit my grandma.
Thank you, Mom.
Family's important.
Yeah, but grandma didn't even want us to come.
So not only did she force us on grandma, probably just to ruin the long weekend that she had planned with her man that she's been seeing who's like 15 years younger than her and totally just wants her for her money,
but that we should butt out of because it's grandma's only source of happiness right now.
But she also deliberately ruined any chance that I had of being in the show.
I don't know, the jury's still out on this one.
And she took grandma's car away from her because she's not allowed to drive anymore, so now it's just sitting in our garage instead of hers.
And you're complaining about what?
She just scored you a car!
Mad, I can't even drive it.
She won't let me get my license.
"My mom won't let me get my license."
No wonder you're grounded, you're mean.
Nuh uh.
And manipulative.
What?
That poor Dix guy didn't know what he had coming.
Uh, wow.
Where's all this animosity coming from?
I don't know, I'm just calling it as I see it.
Is this because I said you don't have any friends?
What?
No.
'Cause it's nothing to be ashamed of.
I'm not ashamed of it.
So you admit it!
No, I don't...
You are a devil woman.
What?
I'm gonna help you.
I don't need help.
Fine, not help.
Coaching.
No, I don't want to be your project.
Okay, okay.
I'll be your friend.
What is this, second grade, Mad?
And as your friend, I'm gonna help you get more friends.
I cannot believe we're having this conversation.
Okay, who's your best friend?
I'm not answering that question.
Do you have a best friend?
Who are your friends?
Come on, Teel, just give me some names.
Do you have any friends?
No!
You don't have any friends?
No.
Not even people at school that you casually talk to?
Not really.
I mostly just try to look like I'm running late so nobody realizes I don't have anybody to talk to.
Wow.
That's really sad.
Yeah.
Well, that's kind of why I wanted to try out for Bye Bye Birdie, because I thought I could at least fit in with the theater geeks.
What about Facebook?
What about Facebook?
Do you have any friends on Facebook?
Are you not on Facebook?
You mean Fakebook?
Okay, not everyone on Facebook is fake.
It's like, it's like Clark Kent.
How is it like Clark Kent?
Clark Kent has a secret identity and a public identity.
You need your public identity.
I just, I don't like where this is headed.
Okay, by the end of the year, you're gonna have 150 Facebook friends.
That is a promise.
Come on, it'll be easy!
I think I'm gonna hurl.
You don't even have to talk to anyone face to face, you just have to add them and that's it.
You need a Facebook profile page.
Okay, Madison, that is a great idea.
Thank you so much, yeah.
Yes, Madison, that is a great idea.
What is the worst that can happen?
I could find out nobody likes me.
How is that any different from right now?
Shut up.
No, you shut up.
Talk to the hand.
So Sophie just told me that fricking Ella Wilson is moving in on Cole.
So while I'm stuck here grounded, she's flirting her ass off with him.
And I do mean her ass right off.
She's super slutty but it doesn't help that she's kinda hot in like a trashy sort of way.
I mean, I can still flirt with him in Earth Science and Math but she's in those classes too!
I do get Ella-free lunches though, Tuesday and Thursday, because she goes to talk time with my dad.
Still.
Wait, with your dad?
Yeah, my dad's my school principal and he's trying this whole "You can talk to me,
"I'm one of you" thing.
But really it's a bunch of desperate girls clamoring for attention, it's disgusting.
I've forbidden Sophie from going.
Hey, Mad?
What?
I made a Facebook page.
No you didn't!
Let me see.
Oh!
Oh, you're a handsome devil.
Very funny.
No, I'm serious, you're really cute in, like, a Rhett and Link sort of way.
Yeah, well, there it is.
Another reminder that I have zero friends.
Uh-uh.
Not after you accept my friend request.
I don't know if I should accept requests from just anybody.
Har har.
Fine.
Accepted.
What do you think of my new profile pic?
Where's the rest of your skirt?
Hey, if you got it, flaunt it.
Hey, Facebook friends!
Blam!
That's amazing.
And I want to get Sophie to add you too, so that'll make it nine.
They said it couldn't be done.
Wait.
What?
None of these friends go to your school!
I thought we went over that.
I don't have any friends at school, so why would I friend them online?
Who's Parthoran?
Is that his real name?
He's just a guy I met at the Akron Fanboy Expo.
You talked to someone you didn't know?
It's way easier when you're wearing a costume.
Well, what's his name?
He goes by Parthoran.
Where does he live?
British Colombia.
Teel, don't you want friends from your own school?
Yeah, but you have to have at least some small reason to friend them, right?
No.
People are friend whores.
I just don't know if I want to be that.
Will you just join this century?
Seriously.
What about other people from elementary school that you used to be friends with but lost touch?
Maybe.
Such as?
Teel!
Sonny.
Sonny Denbrowski.
Sonny, there you go.
But he's like a jock boy tool now.
Beggars can't be choosers.
Cole joined choir!
Can you believe it?
Sophie and I have been working on him for weeks and he finally caved.
I think we're gonna survive the Ella Wilson attacks.
She only has two classes with him now and now I have four, including Health and next week we're doing the unit on human sexuality, so I can say a whole bunch of accidentally dirty comments and get him in the right frame of mind.
Gross.
Oh, and I have Sophie running interference for me while I'm grounded.
So her instructions are to interrupt all conversations between Ella and Cole and to never, ever let them touch.
Which is gonna be quite a project because Ella is super grabby.
Wait, when did you go to the beach?
I thought you were grounded.
Oh, no.
The internet doesn't need to know that I'm grounded.
These are old, from the summer.
Don't I look hot?
If you mean sweaty, then yeah.
That's my beach glow.
I'm not a slut.
I didn't say that.
Then why are you criticizing my pictures?
I'm not criticizing them.
First my skirt is too short and now you think that I'm some sweaty whore?
You don't look like a...
Look, I can post whatever I want.
I don't need your opinion.
You asked me!
Yeah, learn to spot when a girl wants a compliment.
Okay, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it, I was just like...
You look hot.
You look totally hot.
You don't mean that.
Yeah, I do.
I just felt weird saying it to you because...
I don't know.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
Are you sure?
I have to go.
Wait, Mad!
Did you friend Sonny?
Uh, hi, Madison.
Are you feeling better?
Yes, did you friend him?
Yeah.
Are we gonna talk about yesterday or?
Live in the now.
What happened?
He accepted my request.
Your first Facebook friend at school.
Yeah, it's all very good but it's not like it means anything.
Why not?
Because he just sits there on a list.
So?
Then look at his feed.
Learn something about him.
Maybe you can start a conversation that way.
Maybe.
And you gotta post stuff too, okay?
You're in the game now.
No, Mad, I hate all that stuff!
It's all like "Oh, I'm playing my Xbox.
"Look at me play fast.
"Look at me play slow.
"Look at me play boring."
Okay, then we'll post something interesting and somebody might be interested.
I doubt it.
T, sometimes it's just for you.
I talked to Sonny today.
Amazing!
Let's hear.
It's nothing.
We just had this biology test today and he sits right behind me in class.
So I was like "You ready for the test?"
And he was like "Not even close."
And then we took the test.
Oh, okay, yeah.
Awesome.
Yay.
No girls.
What do you mean no girls?
I mean, no, I don't have my eye on any girls right now.
Not even your peripheral vision?
Look, I'm sorry...
The connection...
Failure...
Teel, come on!
You're telling me there's not a single pretty girl at your school that you think about more than the others?
There are lots of pretty girls at my school, Mad, but most of them are stuck up bitches so I'm not really interested.
But you're such a flirt!
I am not a flirt.
Yes, you are!
You flirt with me every single time we talk.
You're telling none of that raw charm is spent on any other girl?
I think you think I live in a very different world than I think I live in.
I think you think I think that.
Shut up.
I'm just saying!
"I'm just saying."
Oh.
Oh, I see.
What?
No, it's cool.
I get it.
What?
Nothing, I just...
No need to say another word.
What are you talking about?
I see who you're saving the good stuff for.
What?
What good stuff?
Seriously, what?
Screen tells me all I need to know.
He accused me of cheating.
Not like I was cheating off of someone else because he knows I got like the best grade in the class, but apparently the second half of Sonny's scantron was, like, identical to mine.
So now Mr. Hanson thinks I was just holding up my test so Sonny could look over my shoulder.
But why would I help him, Mad?
He's a macho jackass who I only friended because you made me.
He just sat there the whole time with this, like, tight shirt on and all the girls in the hallway were creaming their pants.
T, I'm very sorry, but I've got a situation here.
Bigger than a cheating scandal?
Yeah, actually.
Two words.
Retardedment party.
Offensive much?
Just because he's retiring, the school board and the booster club want to throw my dad a party.
Well, that's according to him.
So my dad thought "Oh, I can't use
"the school board's resources for nonessential purposes.
"Why doesn't my daughter throw the party?"
So now I'm stuck planning the party that the school board wants to throw for my dad and I have to do all this crap like invitations, decorations, food, invitations.
You said invitations twice.
Not to mention the doppelganger cake.
Clarification please?
That's the exact replica of Mrs. Spiceman's cake that I have to bake because hers will be positively unpalatable and probably give everyone the runs if it's anything like last year's.
T, don't laugh!
My dad's actually making me do this!
Can't you just ask her not to bake one?
No, she's like the school board's biggest donor or something.
Truth comes out.
And now he's gonna be home all the time and I'm gonna have to wife it up for him even more than I already do.
That man can't, like, do anything for himself.
I'm gonna have to make his food and change his diaper and god knows what else now that he doesn't have an administrative assistant.
You're trying to win.
What?
Yeah, you're trying to win the sucky parent contest.
Whatever.
You love planning parties.
Even mentally challenged parties for your dad.
I bet you're telling all your friends about this and relishing every minute of extra attention that you get for your suffering.
Okay, no, I'm not.
And also, by the way, if you enjoy the suffering caused by your parents, then that negates the suckage and instantly disqualifies you from the contest.
Okay, first of all, there is no contest.
And even if there was, trust me, I would win.
Who's here?
It's Sonny.
Wait, Sonny?
The Sonny?
Yeah.
The hell is he doing here?
I don't know.
What are you waiting for?
Go!
T, go!
Okay, okay.
T!
What, what?
Take me with you!
Okay, I'm bringing...
What do I say to him?
Jesus, T, it's like your first day as a human!
Well, I don't know what he wants.
He's the same guy you hung out with before.
No, he's not, not even close.
Let me see!
He's just standing there.
Wait, T, I lost the picture.
T!
Do I open the door?
Yes, open the door!
Okay.
Hey.
Sonny, what's up?
Hey.
Oh, he is scrumptious.
My mom said I should apologize to you for cheating off you in class today.
T, I can't see.
What?
I can't see why you'd feel like you'd have to.
It's totally cool, I understand.
Thanks for stopping by.
What are you doing?
What is that?
Oh, it's nothing, I was just on the phone with my friend and...
Hey, Sonny, I thought that was you.
Come in, come in, come in for a few minutes.
I could scoop you and Terrance some ice cream.
Like old times.
Sure, that sounds great.
Wait.
Who's Terrance?
Well, hello there, Terrance.
Ha, very funny.
Why didn't you call me?
I wanted to know what happened!
I don't know, I just didn't feel like it.
I texted you like six times.
I noticed.
Well, I saw those mean posts on your Facebook.
I wanted to know what's going on.
Why is your camera not on?
Must be broken.
Okay, that is the stupidest lie I've ever heard.
Seriously, it must be like a bug or something.
Whatever, turn it on.
Can we just talk like this today?
No, why?
To keep up the mystery.
Shut up and turn it on.
I can't.
Are you naked or something?
No.
Then turn it on!
Or I'm hanging up.
Wait, wait, please don't hang up.
T.
Okay, seriously, I got my life back today.
I am officially ungrounded and I may never talk to you again so this might be your last chance.
Okay.
Oh my god.
T, what happened?
Nothing, I just fell.
On your face?
Repeatedly?
I was playing some sports.
Some sports?
Yeah.
T, did you get in a fight?
No.
What else would make your face look like that?
A fight implies that I was an active participant.
You got beat up?
By who?
Just a bunch of ass cavities.
At your school?
Yeah.
Did you tell someone?
No.
What did you tell your parents?
Could we talk about something else, please?
No, your face literally looks like a hamburger.
Mad, can we please talk about something else?
Okay.
Terrance.
And not that either.
I don't like it.
Come on, Terrance, I need to know your origin story.
Please?
I'm gonna keep calling you Terrance.
You're so annoying.
That's not very nice, Terrance.
Fine.
My dad started calling me Teel when I was a little kid because I would always run around the house wearing, like, a cape yelling "I'm the Man of Teel!"
I couldn't pronounce my Ss yet.
Oh!
Yeah, so now my mom is the only one who calls me Terrance and I hate it.
My name is Teel and that's what you should call me.
I can't call you T anymore?
T is fine.
Okay, so I need to hurry because Cole's performing at the school talent show tonight and my dad's giving, like, his last speech as principal or whatever.
He's all freaked out.
He just walked in on me while I was showering.
He couldn't wait 10 minutes to borrow my shaving cream?
I was all like "Dad, get out!"
And he's all like "Nothing I've never seen before."
Whatever.
I don't even care though because tonight I'm a free woman.
I am ungrounded!
Mad, I think you wear too much makeup.
That's not insulting.
No, no, don't freak out, please.
I just think you look better without makeup than with.
You've never seen me without makeup on!
Actually, I have.
It was the accidental pool party?
That night?
Okay, so?
So I just think when you put on all that makeup, it hides everything that's beautiful about your face.
T, I have to wear some.
No, no, I know.
I just think you should wear less.
So we see more of you.
T, you can't do this to me right now!
Cole's gonna be there!
I know, I know, that's why I'm telling you.
I was already freaking out about seeing him.
And now you drop this on me?
I know.
Just let me help you.
What do you mean?
Let me help you put on your makeup.
No!
Just try it for one day and if you don't like it, then you can go back to your old way.
What do you know about makeup?
My mom's a hairdresser who also does makeup, so I've been watching her since I was literally a little kid.
I can do this.
Fine.
Fine?
Fine!
Okay, good.
Now just look right into the camera and I'll tell you what to do.
No, like right into the camera.
Okay!
Good.
T!
Okay, okay.
Start with powder.
Powder?
I don't have any foundation on.
You don't need it.
Yes, I do.
I am way too pale.
No, you don't, your skin is like flawless, it's the best feature of your face.
Plus, it's a good thing to be pale.
How?
You ever heard of Snow White?
You are such a nerd!
Trust me, less is more.
Good.
Now eyes.
Just a little shadow.
That's good, that's good.
Now mascara.
No, uh-uh.
I need eyeliner.
I have bug eyes.
Fine, fine, but it has to be the lightest brown you have.
Why would I use brown?
And it needs to be razor thin, so we don't even know we're seeing it.
Good.
Good.
And mascara?
Unless you want to skip it.
No.
Okay, that's plenty.
What color blush do you have?
I use this one.
No, that's way too orange for you.
You want your cheeks to look like apples.
What about the red one?
This one?
Yeah.
So I can look like a whore?
You won't look like a whore, just don't put so much on.
You just brush it on really lightly, yeah.
Good.
Now lips.
Not your usual red.
We're going regular lip gloss.
You are killing me.
Something shiny but without color.
Your lips are already perfect.
Yeah, that's great.
Now let me just look at you for a second.
Don't look at me like that, you're making me nervous!
Now I dare you to not look in the mirror for the whole day and just notice how people react to you.
Okay.
You look beautiful.
Shut up.
T!
Forward to tonight's performances.
As many of you know...
It's my dad.
I'll be retiring in a few weeks.
Droning on.
You're thrilled, I know.
I've spent time getting to know each and every one of you.
It's Cole.
That means you, Chad Mendez.
I've always told you... ♪ I'm basking in sunshine on a rainy Wednesday night
♪ Nothing's impossible when you're here
♪ I take a look out the window and you'll see
♪ How long is it gonna rain?
♪ I just smile
Oh my god.
Okay, okay, okay.
I'm gonna do it.
There she goes.
Cole?
You were, like, amazing.
Thanks.
These are for you.
You were amazing.
I just sang what I felt, you know?
Yeah, totally.
Yeah, totally.
Wow, flowers.
Yeah.
Well, you look, you know, like.
Thank you.
Hey, you know, it sucks that your dad's retiring because he's like, he's the best.
Oh, no, that's 'cause he's not your dad.
But you know.
You still grounded and stuff?
No.
Well, my parents aren't home tonight and I wanted to know if you wanted to come over.
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, I could make time, yeah.
Cool, I'll text you.
Okay.
Okay.
Bye.
T!
You are a genius!
Oh, easy now.
Okay, Mr. Fashion Consultant.
You have to help me choose what to wear to Cole's for the big night.
You really think tonight's the big night?
Duh.
Didn't you hear that song?
It was totally about me.
We could do this shirt with jeans.
But then I'd have to wear a thong.
T, help!
What about the dress?
The dress?
The dress?
What am I, like 30?
At least try it on for me?
Okay.
Whoa, wait, whoa.
What are you doing?
A little shy, Mr. T?
No.
T, okay, when you have a girlfriend and you're gonna want to have sex with her, you're gonna have to see her naked.
Okay, well, for now can you please just go off screen or something?
Okay.
But you don't know what you're missing!
Wear that.
Really?
Yes, really.
It's ridiculously gorgeous, wear it.
I'm sorry, T, I'm gonna have to use my veto power here.
This shows more skin.
T, I can't believe this is happening.
Please be careful, Mad.
Okay, Dad.
Who else is here?
I hear music.
Mad, you made it!
Hi.
Hi.
I guess it could have been worse.
It was worse.
Oh yeah.
Oh yeah, I forgot, Cole and Sophie, they had sex.
With Sophie Sophie?
Are you effing kidding me?
How convenient, right?
Apparently after they dropped me off, they went back to his house and had sex.
Big fat betrayal sex.
How do you know?
Oh, it's all over Facebook.
And when I tried to talk to her about it, she full on lies to my face.
You know, Mad, I think it's for the best.
How?
Because you don't want your first time to be some hookup at a party.
It was not a hookup!
It was Cole.
And besides, it was not my, no.
What?
It wasn't what?
Your first time?
Madison, are you keeping secrets?
Madison!
Oh.
How could you not tell me that?
Who did you have sex with?
I can't do this!
I can't do this!
I keep trying and I keep messing it up!
I'm sure they're fine.
No, they're not, they're not fine!
They're not fine, they have to be perfect!
My dad is gonna see them and they have to be perfect.
He's not gonna mind.
No, it has to be perfect!
I'm starting over.
Hey, look, Mads.
Stop.
Let me see.
Let me see.
What?
It has a smudge right there!
It looks great.
No, they don't.
Mad, Cole's an idiot.
I can't imagine what he was thinking.
You're so much prettier than Sophie.
I'm not pretty.
You're right, you're not pretty, you're beautiful.
Shut up.
I mean it.
You're intelligent and beautiful...
You're an intelligent and beautiful girl.
Woman.
Woman, even, Mad.
You're an intelligent and beautiful woman who's fun and funny and interesting and mysterious.
And beautiful.
You said that three times.
It was four.
By the way, I have 37 Facebook friends.
That's great.
I have an audition this week.
You didn't tell me that.
It's not really a big deal.
No spontaneous trips to grandma's house?
I found a way around that.
How?
I'm not going to tell my mom.
What's the part?
Romeo.
That's a big part.
Sure you can handle that?
Well, you know, I memorized the speech but I don't really know what else to do.
You show me.
No.
Oh yeah.
After my whole ordeal with Cole, you don't think I deserve some entertainment?
Come on.
Fine.
You and your ways.
Okay, but for tonight's performance of Romeo and Juliet, the role of Juliet will be played by the lovely and talented Miss Madison Daniels.
Okay.
Oh, and I figure the scene is more funny than serious because he's not like this big romantic, he's just horny and wants to see Juliet's boobs.
Wow.
Okay.
Here goes.
But soft!
What light through yonder window breaks?
It is the east and Juliet is the sun.
Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon who is already sick and pale with grief that thou her maid art far more fair than she!
Be not her maid, since she is envious!
Her vestal livery is but sick and green and none but fools do wear it.
Cast it off!
It is my lady.
It is my love!
See how she leans her cheek upon her hand.
Oh, but I were a glove upon that hand that I might touch that cheek.
That's it.
So did it suck that bad?
No.
That didn't suck.
That didn't suck at all.
It's late.
Why are you calling me?
Were you asleep?
Yeah.
Do you know what time it is?
Well, wake up, because I have something to show you.
I'm up, I just can't promise I'll stay up.
I think I can keep you up.
We'll see.
We will see.
So, what?
T, don't rush me.
Mad, I'm really tired.
I want to go back to bed.
You wish.
You're being weird.
Good night.
No, T, wait, wait!
T, give me a sec.
I'm just gonna put my head down right here.
So I've been thinking.
I've been thinking a lot about what you said.
Whatever it was, it sure was brilliant.
How I shouldn't try to have sex with idiots, especially Cole.
It's good to be idiot-free.
I agree.
I was also thinking about you.
I'm flattered.
I was thinking about you a lot.
And how you're not an idiot.
So...
This...
Is for you.
Uh, what are you doing?
Seriously, Mad.
Just enjoy it.
Do you like it?
Uh...
I'll take that as a yes.
Madison, don't.
Don't be a prude.
Mad, Mad, stop, seriously.
This is not, I'm not watching this!
I'm not watching.
Why not?
Because it's weird and desperate.
Weird and desperate?
Yeah.
You're an ass!
What?
I'm trying to give you something!
My own personal internet porn?
Is that what this is?
Well, Mad, that's what it feels like.
So I disgust you.
No, no, you don't disgust me.
Then what?
We're friends and you wanna stay friends?
Well, yeah.
Fuck you.
Wait.
What?
What?
I'm sorry.
Okay.
I'll hold onto that while I cry myself to sleep.
I mean it.
I didn't even know you liked me.
Yeah right.
Mad, I'm serious.
I figured you'd be out chasing all the gorgeous popular guys.
T, you're gorgeous.
No, I'm not.
T, yes, you are.
And you're sweet.
And you actually listen to what I say.
What did you expect?
I don't know.
First you internet stalk me, then you have all these deep conversations with me, then you're all like "You're beautiful and intelligent
"and Cole's an idiot."
He is an idiot.
Yeah, well, you are too.
Yeah, I guess I am.
Then why do I feel like the idiot?
Look, Mad, I've been driving around all night trying to decide whether to tell you this.
Wait, driving?
My mom's afraid to practice with me, so sometimes when I can't sleep, I take my grandma's car around the neighborhood.
Rebel.
I don't really like girls.
I'm hanging up now.
No, no, wait, Mad, I mean it.
You don't get it.
I don't really like any girls that way.
Because...
Oh, crap.
I like boys.
What?
Yeah.
I think I might be, you know.
That's convenient.
Mad, I mean it.
You're the first person I've ever told.
Wait, really?
Really.
I've been wanting to tell you for like a really long time but I didn't know when or how to bring it up.
Well, this was perfect timing.
I'm sorry.
Are you...
Are you sure?
I'm not really sure about anything.
Then how do you know?
Well, I mean, there aren't really girls that I think about more than any others except for you.
But then I just think about, you know, what we're going to talk about next time we see each other.
Not other stuff.
Do you think about other stuff with boys?
Yeah, kind of all the time.
Oh.
Like, you know.
Sonny.
Wait, him?
Yeah.
Him.
A lot.
I can see why.
Me and him used to be such good friends when we were kids.
But then we both changed so much and he became really good at sports and I became really good at watching him play sports.
T.
Is this why they beat you up?
Yeah.
Well, yes and no.
What do you mean?
Well, it was because of Sonny.
Wait, he beat you up?
No, no, no, no, it was his friends.
He didn't.
Well...
You remember when he came over to my house after I helped him cheat?
You said you didn't.
Yeah, that's what I said.
Okay.
Well, ice cream with my mom was perfectly awkward.
But then we started talking about this card game that we used to play when we were kids, Magic?
And it turned out that he was still really bummed about this card he traded me, like, years ago.
And so I told him that I still had it.
So we went up to my room and I gave it back to him.
And then we started looking at all the other cards and kind of looking at each one
and reliving some of our old battles.
And then I honestly don't know how it happened but there was this, like, tingly electric gravity
between us and it kept pulling us closer and closer together.
And then suddenly we were kissing.
I know, I was, like, shocked too.
It was literally like every fantasy I ever had was coming true in one simultaneous moment.
And so we kept kissing for like five minutes and then, you know, both of us getting more and more into it.
And then really suddenly, he pulled away.
Like super abruptly.
And he got out of there as fast as he could.
He didn't say anything to me as he was leaving, but, Mad, for those five minutes, it was like magic.
T!
So what happened though?
He completely ignored me the next day at school, so I tried texting him.
But he was just like "Who is this, how'd you get my number?"
So I mustered up the courage to go talk to him after school.
Well, I wasn't gonna show you this, but whatever.
Here.
Hey, Mad, I know you're in school right now but I wanted to show you my latest triumph.
I think I'm gonna go try to talk to Sonny again.
Wish me luck.
Hey.
Hey.
So biology sucked today, huh?
Yeah.
Listen, I gotta go.
I was actually wondering if maybe we could...
Hey, that that fag you were talking about?
Yeah.
I don't know what he wants, but he's not gonna find it here.
I think I know what he wants.
Can we go somewhere and talk?
We have nothing to talk about.
I just was...
Whoa!
Get away!
Get away, assbag.
Get off of me!
That was a mistake.
Get off!
Like that?
Oh, Sonny, Sonny, I want you so bad!
T.
Yeah.
T, I can't believe they would do that.
Is this gonna be weird now?
Us?
Yeah.
No, T.
Yeah, it's gonna be totally weird.
This is why I didn't tell you for so long, Mad, because I knew things would get all weird.
No.
No, they're not weird.
Yeah, well, if you say so.
T, I'm serious.
You gotta give me a break.
I just found out tonight while I was in my underwear.
T, wake up.
I have an idea.
Don't you ever sleep?
What if you start a gay-straight alliance at your school?
No way.
I looked and there aren't any in your area.
You could connect to other gay kids at your school.
You could maybe even help them out.
Yeah, help them get the crap kicked out of them.
No, T, that's the whole point of GSA, so that wouldn't happen.
I'm sorry, not interested.
T, you need support.
Look, I really appreciate what you're trying to do but I'm not ready for that.
T, you can't just sit there and suffer.
All by yourself.
Yeah, I can.
No, T, you need to tell someone.
I did.
No, someone other than me.
People need to know so that they can help you.
They're the ones who need help.
Fine.
Fine, then make them deal with you.
Mad, stop pushing me, okay?
I'm not pushing you.
I don't want to be your cause anymore.
You're not my cause, you're my friend.
Then stop friending me so hard.
T, just look at the website I'm sending to you.
You just posted that on my wall.
So what?
So now everyone's gonna think I'm gay.
No, T, it's just a link.
It's a link to a gay website, Mad!
It's for straight people too.
You don't, you don't send that to someone unless you think they're gay!
You are gay.
Well, I'm sorry if I don't want to flaunt my sexuality all over the internet like some people I know.
Why are you being such a jerk?
Because you just outed me to all my friends!
What friends, T?
You have like 78 acquaintances on Facebook who don't even see your feed because you don't post anything.
T.
Here we are at my dad's retirement party.
Wow, look at those amazing decorations.
Aren't they incredible?
Oh, but the cake.
Oh yeah, the cake, yummy.
I wonder who made it?
Shh, I won't tell if you don't.
Obviously, all these people are here because of my expertly designed invitations.
Well, almost everybody.
I wish my friend Teel was here.
But we can't have it all now, can we?
Hey.
What's with the cards?
Okay.
It's alright.
There's a smudge on that one.
Mad, you don't need to be fixed.
Mad, really, it's alright.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You used to make me climb around the back because supposedly the front was being guarded.
I'd get all these scratches all over my arms from the bark.
Me too.
Yeah, I know.
What do you mean?
Maddie, it's almost nine!
Okay, Daddy!
Wait, what are you talking about?
Keep watching what?
Madison.
Okay, I promise.
You're kinda starting to freak me out.
Madison.
Madison!
Stop.
Stop.
Hi, I'd like to report a crime.
You shouldn't have done that.
Are you okay?
What happened, did the cops come?
Did they arrest him?
Yeah, they came.
And my dad cleared things up.
It was all a misunderstanding.
What do you mean, cleared it up?
Didn't you tell them?
I told them that I made it up.
What?
T, I don't think we should be talking anymore, okay?
Madison, what the hell?
I have to be there for my dad right now.
He's going through a lot, so...
No, no, Madison.
You need to do something.
Good luck with the show.
Wait, Madison!
Madison!
Alack, there lies more peril...
Alack, there lies more...
Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye...
Hey, sweetie.
Mom.
Sorry, knock knock.
You need a ride to rehearsal?
No, Karina and Sydney are picking me up.
Also I think everyone's going to go out afterwards, so I might be home late.
You know, grandma's coming to your opening tomorrow.
Okay.
I'm very proud of you.
Mom, gotta run my lines.
Okay, I'm going.
Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye than in 20 of their swords.
Obviously all these people are here because of my expertly designed invitations.
Well, almost everybody.
I wish my friend Teel was here.
But...
I wish my friend Teel was here.
I wish my friend Teel was here.
But we can't have it all now, can we?
Hey, Mad!
Right now I am on the run.
I stole my grandma's car and a bunch of money from my dad's sock drawer and I told my director a whole story about having, like, a dire family emergency and he bought the whole thing.
It turns out I'm a pretty good actor.
And now here I am on the road.
I know it's a little bit extreme, but you're not taking my calls.
So California here I come.
Apparently there are nothing but trees in Illinois.
Oh, look, a field.
I guess that's the end of that...
Oh my god, a field!
Mad, if you don't pick up,
I'm gonna be forced to do something drastic.
Oh man, it's so pretty.
Hey, Mad, really wish you would talk to me right now.
I'm trying to stay awake over here.
Nothing a caffeinated beverage can't fix.
Oh, it's my mom.
She's probably freaking out.
I bet she's called the cops like three times.
This could be a very pointless trip.
19 messages from my mom, six from my dad.
And yes, they have called the cops, so congratulations, Mad.
You've officially turned me into a fugitive.
Morning, Mad!
I hope you're seeing this.
I never knew it would be so beautiful.
Hey, Mad.
Just got here.
The GPS sent me on kind of a wild goose chase and then I realized that you're on South Maple and not North Maple, and those are very different addresses.
Oh, you're calling me.
Guess where I am right now...
T, you shouldn't have come here!
Go home!
I figured you might say that, but...
My dad is right downstairs!
Don't worry, I'm coming around the back.
What are you doing?
I'm coming up.
No!
T!
Oh my god.
Oh my god, T, no.
T!
No!
Shh!
Oh my god, T.
T, no way.
T, you're gonna kill yourself.
What else is new?
Oh my god, no.
Hey.
If my dad sees you, he will kill you.
Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye than in 20 of their swords.
You have to leave.
Oh, will thou leave me so unsatisfied?
What do you want?
The exchange of thy love's faithful vow from mine.
Maddie?
I'll be right down, Dad!
I had to see you in person.
No, T.
I already told you that I can't talk to you anymore.
No, we can go to the police again and tell them everything.
No, they won't believe me, no.
They'll believe me.
No.
I'll be with you the whole time.
I said no.
Why?
Madison.
Look, he's not a monster, okay?
Yes, he is.
No, he's not, you don't know him!
You don't know him!
Okay, okay.
No, I can't.
I can't, okay?
I can't turn him in, I can't.
I just need you to come with me so we can find some help.
No.
He will send the National Guard, you don't get it.
He shouldn't be doing that to you.
Better that I learn from him than some jerkoff boy who doesn't love me!
He doesn't love you.
Yes, he does!
Do you remember how you helped me?
When I didn't have any friends?
You remember that?
Now I have 142 Facebook friends.
Mad, can you believe that?
I never could have been able to do that without you.
Do you know what I was doing on the first night that I called you?
I was planning to commit suicide.
Right after you left, I took an entire bottle of acetaminophen.
And then you called back.
You remember that?
You called me back from the party because I was lonely or something.
And then suddenly I had one friend and that was enough.
T, I had no idea.
Well, I didn't want you to know that it was that bad.
I was mostly just so amazed that this beautiful, brave, smart girl wanted to talk to me.
You helped me so much.
It's okay to need help.
142 Facebook friends?
Acquaintances.
I wish we'd made it to 150.
We gotta go.
Maddie, what's going on in there?
Nothing, Dad.
Why's the door locked?
It's locked?
You gotta come with me, Mad.
I can't.
Madison, is there a boy in there?
No, Dad, no!
Open the goddamn door!
He's gonna kill you.
I'm not afraid.
Madison!
Dad, stop, please!
Oh my god.
Open this door immediately.
No, I can't go.
I can't do this.
It's okay.
You can.
No, T.
You're my best friend.
Madison!
Hey.
Hi.
How you doing?
I'm okay.
Today's been one of the better days.
Good.
Yeah.
How's your audition?
Some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrust upon them.
You are such a drama queen.
Hey, where are you right now?
Don't be nosy.
Close your eyes.
Why?
Just close your eyes.
Okay.
Tada!
What is it?
What does it look like?
It's a cape.
Oh my god.
That is amazing.
Where were you when I was seven?
T.
I just wanted to say thank you.
To you and your parents for being there for me these past few months, through the courts and...
Mad, you don't have to say that.
Just let me finish.
You saved me.
You're my Man of Teel.
Mad.
I don't know what to say.
Don't say anything.
Just pose.
Oh no.
No!
You're not actually gonna post that, are you?
No.
This one's just for us.

Too late, called you first.
Whoa.
Whoa?
What do you mean, whoa?
Nothing.
I meant, nothing.
You said "whoa" when you answered my call.
I just, I didn't realize, you just look super different.
I hope that's a good thing.
Yeah, I mean, you're totally...
You grew up too.
What grade are you in?
[Madison] I'm in your grade, duh.
Right.
[Madison] How'd you find me?
I was just looking through...
Are you stalking me?
No, no, no, no, I wasn't, I wasn't.
I was just kidding!
T, come on, let's skip the awkwardness.
What's your deal?
My deal?
Yeah, what's your deal?
Well, I guess I'm still stuck in Michigan,
I hate school, and my parents suck.
That's true for like everybody.
Not everybody lives in Michigan.
Har har.
So you still like comic books?
Oh.
Yeah, I guess I do.
That's awesome.
No, it is.
I'm in choir.
They wanted me to join the school musical but you'd have to be there like every night and I'm way too busy, so.
My school's doing this Bye Bye Birdie year.
I was gonna audition but then... (laughs)
What are you doing tonight?
Nothing.
Just probably playing video games.
Nothing?
It's a Saturday night, you're not going out with your friends?
I would, but they just couldn't tonight.
Come on, T, shake it up.
You gotta live a little.
Yeah.
I usually...
Hey, T, you know what, I gotta go.
My friend's gonna be here in like a minute and if I don't get downstairs, my dad's gonna get to her and he gets all weird and flirty, so...
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Can we talk again sometime?
I don't know, I've got a killer schedule.
Okay, totally.
You know, I was just thinking...
Hey, T, you know what?
She's actually here, I gotta go.
Bye.
Bye.
(sighs)
(rings)
Teel!
Hi, Teel!
This is Sophie.
Oh, oh, no, Sophie, no.
We ignore Sophie right now.
No, don't ignore me!
Here, take a jello shot.
Stop, stop, no.
Okay, you drink it then.
No, Sophie, no.
They're non-alcoholic.
Okay, fine.
I promise!
Fine, okay.
I promise.
Okay, I'm putting this down.
I thought that you might be bored tonight so I brought you to Becky's party.
Oh yeah.
Looks like fun.
(laughs)
What?
Seems fun.
Oh, we're gonna be here until, like, super late.
Okay, so here's the deal.
I've been flirting with Cole McCovey all night but apparently he would rather play with Ella.
Ping pong, of all things.
What's ping pong?
What?
What's ping pong?
Like, ping pong, table tennis?
You know, the game?
Oh, you actually mean, like, ping pong.
Okay, so here's Cole.
Isn't he cute?
I guess.
And here's Ella.
(gags) I do not like her at all.
So I wanted Sophie's help with this but she, as you can see, (laughs) is gone.
So I turn to you, okay?
See this guy over here?
His name is John Dixon but we call him Dix because he literally is, you know, with that.
Right.
So if I can get him to kiss me in front of Cole, maybe I can make Cole jealous and have him want to play ping pong with me.
What do you think?
It doesn't sound like the best...
I'll take that as a yes.
Okay, just wait here.
Hey, Dix.
Don't call me that.
What you playing?
What are you playing?
Hey, I was just about to beat my high score!
Candy Crush.
High score?
Would you rather score on this or score with me?
I... (kisses)
Whoa, hey.
You guys, why don't you get a room?
Hey, hey, horndog!
T!
Get the hell off of her!
You watching us, you little perv?
Hey!
Stop!
Oh, you are such a bitch!
Oh my god, oh my god!
Mad...
Mad.
(laughs)
Sophie!
Mad... (screams)
(splashes)
Teel, hey!
Take a look!

(rings)
(sighs)
T, I was supposed to call you.
Are you okay?
Yeah, the party was insane.
That Dix guy is a dick.
Right?
Don't worry, my friends pushed him into the pool too and he tried to dunk me, but I was on the swim team, so...
It was good because I had beer all over my shirt, so I totally rinsed it out and Cole came out to watch.
I guess as long as Cole was there.
Isn't it like 4:30 your time?
Yeah, but I'm up, so whatever.
You're a night owl.
Don't you have a curfew?
(yawns) 11:30.
But my dad goes to bed at, like, 10, so.
He doesn't check up on you?
No.
He trusts me.
I'm totally trustworthy.
Yeah, I can see that.
T, it's a party.
It's all part of the fun, you gotta loosen up if you want friends.
I have friends.
I have, like, tons of friends.
I'm just saying, it doesn't seem like you go out that much.
No, my friends and I go out all the time, they just couldn't tonight.
Okay.
Besides, you know, sometimes I like having a night to myself every once in a while.
Sometimes it's nice to just decompress, do some gaming, listen to some music.
(calm music)
Yeah, no, I get it.
I just...
Wait, I think I hear my dad.
Bye.
My dad took my phone.
What, why?
I'm grounded for two weeks.
He found out that I missed curfew.
How?
He came in here, like, at midnight and I guess I wasn't in here, obviously.
WTF, this is my room.
That's a total invasion of privacy.
I don't want him in here touching my stuff, sniffing through my underwear drawer.
Okay.
Wait, I thought he goes to bed at, like, 10.
Yeah, usually.
But lately he's all freaked out because he's retiring in a few weeks.
He just roams the halls drinking nightcaps.
What's he freaked out for though?
'Cause isn't that good news?
You'd think.
But he, like, doesn't know what to do with himself now, so.
What about your mom?
My mom died seven years ago, so she's not much help.
Oh my god, I'm so sorry.
I didn't know.
Whatever.
I'm over it, but my dad needs to find a new hobby because this is getting ridiculous.
Sugar free.
[Teel] Wait, if you're grounded, then how are you talking to me?
Oh, he didn't take my computer.
He thinks I'm doing homework on it, which is you.
So I guess I'll be doing you every day after school.
Whoa.
Mind out of the gutter, little man.
You're the one who said it.
Girls are allowed to have their mind in the gutter.
It's sexy.
When guys do it, it's just, it's gross.
I wasn't aware of that rule.
Stick with me.
You'll learn.
[Teel's Mom] Hey, sweetie?
Hon, you've been up here quite a while.
You been playing video games?
What?
No, I'm talking to my friend Madison.
[Teel's Mom] Hon, please don't.
What?
I'm telling the truth!
You know what Dr. Thomas said about you making things up.
Hi, Mrs. Johnson!
Oh my, I'm sorry I didn't realize.
Madison Daniels, do you remember me?
I used to live down the street from you.
Madison, what a surprise.
Madison Daniels, of course I remember.
You didn't tell me you were talking to Madison Daniels.
Yeah, actually, Mom, I did.
Well, that's great, that is just great!
I won't interrupt you.
Nice to see you again.
You too, Mrs. Johnson.
Madison Daniels, huh.
See?
My parents suck.
She seems nice.
You have no idea.
You might think that your parents suck, but that is just a teenage syndrome that distorts your perception, when in actual scientifical fact, they are perfectly legit.
Who says I'm being scientific about it?
No, I'm just saying, I need more proof before I accept your assertion.
What are you, a lawyer?
I'm gonna be.
So pony up.
Okay.
My parents, every year, make me try out for sports, even though I don't have any talent or inclination or even the slightest interest in the jock arts.
Eh, wrong answer.
They're just trying to make sure that you're well-rounded.
Which is actually the distinctive trait of a loving parent.
Last year, I auditioned, or tried out for the track team and I deliberately ran as slow as I could so that I would get cut from the team.
Totally reasonable.
Right, but then my mom read the school guidelines and she discovered that technically the coach isn't allowed to cut anybody from the team.
It's a little known secret.
So she forced him to let me run.
It was like a whole to-do at my school and then finally we came up with this shoddy compromise that kept me on the team as the mascot.
What's the mascot?
Oh no!
Yeah.
So now I'm at all the track meets, which no one even goes to in the first place, and I'm stuck wearing this ratty old costume that hasn't seen the light of day since like 1992.
I think they just wanted me to kind of get involved and make friends, but it really just made me a target for the coach's kid who kept kicking me in the shins.
Okay, although misguided, it came out of concern for your well-being.
They tried to get me to go out for football this year,
Mad, and I had to pretty convincingly sprain an ankle to get out of that.
Yes, okay, all dads want their kids to play sports.
That's like a primal instinct from our hunter-gatherer days.
It's not my dad, it's my mom.
Unexpected.
Yeah, it's like she's on this mission to keep me from becoming...
A dweeb?
Thanks.
You'll survive.
It gets worse.
Always.
You remember how I said I wanted to audition for Bye Bye Birdie?
[Madison] You did?
Yeah, I told you that the first night we talked.
Yeah, yeah.
Bye Bye, yeah.
Right.
Well, I had to miss the auditions because my mom decided we should take a spontaneous trip to visit my grandma.
Thank you, Mom.
Family's important.
Yeah, but grandma didn't even want us to come.
So not only did she force us on grandma, probably just to ruin the long weekend that she had planned with her man that she's been seeing who's like 15 years younger than her and totally just wants her for her money,
but that we should butt out of because it's grandma's only source of happiness right now.
But she also deliberately ruined any chance that I had of being in the show.
I don't know, the jury's still out on this one.
And she took grandma's car away from her because she's not allowed to drive anymore, so now it's just sitting in our garage instead of hers.
(laughs) And you're complaining about what?
She just scored you a car!
Mad, I can't even drive it.
She won't let me get my license.
"My mom won't let me get my license."
No wonder you're grounded, you're mean.
Nuh uh.
And manipulative.
[Madison] What?
That poor Dix guy didn't know what he had coming.
[Madison] Uh, wow.
Where's all this animosity coming from?
I don't know, I'm just calling it as I see it.
Is this because I said you don't have any friends?
What?
No.
[Madison] 'Cause it's nothing to be ashamed of.
I'm not ashamed of it.
So you admit it!
No, I don't...
You are a devil woman.
(calm music)
What?
I'm gonna help you.
I don't need help.
[Madison] Fine, not help.
Coaching.
No, I don't want to be your project.
Okay, okay.
I'll be your friend.
What is this, second grade, Mad?
And as your friend, I'm gonna help you get more friends.
I cannot believe we're having this conversation.
Okay, who's your best friend?
I'm not answering that question.
Do you have a best friend?
Who are your friends?
Come on, Teel, just give me some names.
Do you have any friends?
No!
You don't have any friends?
No.
Not even people at school that you casually talk to?
Not really.
I mostly just try to look like I'm running late so nobody realizes I don't have anybody to talk to.
Wow.
That's really sad.
Yeah.
Well, that's kind of why I wanted to try out for Bye Bye Birdie, because I thought I could at least fit in with the theater geeks.
What about Facebook?
What about Facebook?
Do you have any friends on Facebook?
Are you not on Facebook?
[Teel] You mean Fakebook?
Okay, not everyone on Facebook is fake.
It's like, it's like Clark Kent.
How is it like Clark Kent?
Clark Kent has a secret identity and a public identity.
You need your public identity.
I just, I don't like where this is headed.
Okay, by the end of the year, you're gonna have 150 Facebook friends.
That is a promise.
Come on, it'll be easy!
I think I'm gonna hurl.
You don't even have to talk to anyone face to face, you just have to add them and that's it.
You need a Facebook profile page.
(fakes throwing up)
Okay, Madison, that is a great idea.
Thank you so much, yeah.
Yes, Madison, that is a great idea.
What is the worst that can happen?
I could find out nobody likes me.
How is that any different from right now?
Shut up.
[Madison] No, you shut up.
Talk to the hand.
So Sophie just told me that fricking Ella Wilson is moving in on Cole.
So while I'm stuck here grounded, she's flirting her ass off with him.
And I do mean her ass right off.
She's super slutty but it doesn't help that she's kinda hot in like a trashy sort of way.
I mean, I can still flirt with him in Earth Science and Math but she's in those classes too!
I do get Ella-free lunches though, Tuesday and Thursday, because she goes to talk time with my dad.
Still.
Wait, with your dad?
Yeah, my dad's my school principal and he's trying this whole "You can talk to me,
"I'm one of you" thing.
But really it's a bunch of desperate girls clamoring for attention, it's disgusting.
I've forbidden Sophie from going.
Hey, Mad?
[Madison] What?
I made a Facebook page.
(screams) No you didn't!
Let me see.
(gasps) Oh!
Oh, you're a handsome devil.
[Teel] Very funny.
No, I'm serious, you're really cute in, like, a Rhett and Link sort of way.
Yeah, well, there it is.
Another reminder that I have zero friends.
Uh-uh.
Not after you accept my friend request.
I don't know if I should accept requests from just anybody.
[Madison] Har har.
Fine.
Accepted.
What do you think of my new profile pic?
Where's the rest of your skirt?
Hey, if you got it, flaunt it.
Hey, Facebook friends!
Blam!
That's amazing.
And I want to get Sophie to add you too, so that'll make it nine.
They said it couldn't be done.
Wait.
What?
None of these friends go to your school!
I thought we went over that.
I don't have any friends at school, so why would I friend them online?
Who's Parthoran?
(laughs) Is that his real name?
He's just a guy I met at the Akron Fanboy Expo.
[Madison] You talked to someone you didn't know?
It's way easier when you're wearing a costume.
[Madison] Well, what's his name?
He goes by Parthoran.
[Madison] Where does he live?
British Colombia.
Teel, don't you want friends from your own school?
Yeah, but you have to have at least some small reason to friend them, right?
No.
People are friend whores.
I just don't know if I want to be that.
Will you just join this century?
Seriously.
What about other people from elementary school that you used to be friends with but lost touch?
Maybe.
Such as?
Teel!
Sonny.
Sonny Denbrowski.
Sonny, there you go.
But he's like a jock boy tool now.
Beggars can't be choosers.
Cole joined choir!
Can you believe it?
Sophie and I have been working on him for weeks and he finally caved.
I think we're gonna survive the Ella Wilson attacks.
She only has two classes with him now and now I have four, including Health and next week we're doing the unit on human sexuality, so I can say a whole bunch of accidentally dirty comments and get him in the right frame of mind.
Gross.
Oh, and I have Sophie running interference for me while I'm grounded.
So her instructions are to interrupt all conversations between Ella and Cole and to never, ever let them touch.
Which is gonna be quite a project because Ella is super grabby.
Wait, when did you go to the beach?
I thought you were grounded.
Oh, no.
The internet doesn't need to know that I'm grounded.
These are old, from the summer.
Don't I look hot?
If you mean sweaty, then yeah.
That's my beach glow.
I'm not a slut.
[Teel] I didn't say that.
[Madison] Then why are you criticizing my pictures?
I'm not criticizing them.
First my skirt is too short and now you think that I'm some sweaty whore?
You don't look like a...
Look, I can post whatever I want.
I don't need your opinion.
You asked me!
Yeah, learn to spot when a girl wants a compliment.
Okay, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it, I was just like...
You look hot.
You look totally hot.
You don't mean that.
Yeah, I do.
I just felt weird saying it to you because...
I don't know.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
[Teel] Are you sure?
I have to go.
Wait, Mad!
Did you friend Sonny?
Uh, hi, Madison.
Are you feeling better?
Yes, did you friend him?
Yeah.
Are we gonna talk about yesterday or?
Live in the now.
What happened?
He accepted my request.
(gasps) Your first Facebook friend at school.
Yeah, it's all very good but it's not like it means anything.
[Madison] Why not?
Because he just sits there on a list.
So?
Then look at his feed.
Learn something about him.
Maybe you can start a conversation that way.
Maybe.
And you gotta post stuff too, okay?
You're in the game now.
No, Mad, I hate all that stuff!
It's all like "Oh, I'm playing my Xbox.
"Look at me play fast.
"Look at me play slow.
"Look at me play boring."
Okay, then we'll post something interesting and somebody might be interested.
I doubt it.
T, sometimes it's just for you.
I talked to Sonny today.
Amazing!
Let's hear.
It's nothing.
We just had this biology test today and he sits right behind me in class.
So I was like "You ready for the test?"
And he was like "Not even close."
And then we took the test.
Oh, okay, yeah.
Awesome.
Yay.
No girls.
What do you mean no girls?
I mean, no, I don't have my eye on any girls right now.
Not even your peripheral vision?
Look, I'm sorry...
The connection...
Failure...
Teel, come on!
You're telling me there's not a single pretty girl at your school that you think about more than the others?
There are lots of pretty girls at my school, Mad, but most of them are stuck up bitches so I'm not really interested.
[Madison] But you're such a flirt!
I am not a flirt.
Yes, you are!
You flirt with me every single time we talk.
You're telling none of that raw charm is spent on any other girl?
I think you think I live in a very different world than I think I live in.
I think you think I think that.
[Teel] Shut up.
I'm just saying!
"I'm just saying."
Oh.
Oh, I see.
What?
No, it's cool.
I get it.
What?
Nothing, I just...
No need to say another word.
(laughs) What are you talking about?
I see who you're saving the good stuff for.
What?
What good stuff?
Seriously, what?
Screen tells me all I need to know.
He accused me of cheating.
Not like I was cheating off of someone else because he knows I got like the best grade in the class, but apparently the second half of Sonny's scantron was, like, identical to mine.
So now Mr. Hanson thinks I was just holding up my test so Sonny could look over my shoulder.
But why would I help him, Mad?
He's a macho jackass who I only friended because you made me.
He just sat there the whole time with this, like, tight shirt on and all the girls in the hallway were creaming their pants.
T, I'm very sorry, but I've got a situation here.
Bigger than a cheating scandal?
Yeah, actually.
Two words.
Retardedment party.
Offensive much?
Just because he's retiring, the school board and the booster club want to throw my dad a party.
Well, that's according to him.
So my dad thought "Oh, I can't use
"the school board's resources for nonessential purposes.
"Why doesn't my daughter throw the party?"
So now I'm stuck planning the party that the school board wants to throw for my dad and I have to do all this crap like invitations, decorations, food, invitations.
You said invitations twice.
Not to mention the doppelganger cake.
Clarification please?
That's the exact replica of Mrs. Spiceman's cake that I have to bake because hers will be positively unpalatable and probably give everyone the runs if it's anything like last year's.
(laughs)
T, don't laugh!
My dad's actually making me do this!
Can't you just ask her not to bake one?
No, she's like the school board's biggest donor or something.
Truth comes out.
And now he's gonna be home all the time and I'm gonna have to wife it up for him even more than I already do.
That man can't, like, do anything for himself.
I'm gonna have to make his food and change his diaper and god knows what else now that he doesn't have an administrative assistant.
You're trying to win.
[Madison] What?
Yeah, you're trying to win the sucky parent contest.
Whatever.
You love planning parties.
Even mentally challenged parties for your dad.
I bet you're telling all your friends about this and relishing every minute of extra attention that you get for your suffering.
Okay, no, I'm not.
And also, by the way, if you enjoy the suffering caused by your parents, then that negates the suckage and instantly disqualifies you from the contest.
Okay, first of all, there is no contest.
And even if there was, trust me, I would win.
(doorbell rings)
Who's here?
It's Sonny.
Wait, Sonny?
The Sonny?
Yeah.
The hell is he doing here?
I don't know.
What are you waiting for?
Go!
T, go!
Okay, okay.
[Madison] T!
What, what?
Take me with you!
Okay, I'm bringing...
What do I say to him?
Jesus, T, it's like your first day as a human!
Well, I don't know what he wants.
He's the same guy you hung out with before.
No, he's not, not even close.
Let me see!
He's just standing there.
Wait, T, I lost the picture.
T!
Do I open the door?
Yes, open the door!
Okay.
Hey.
Sonny, what's up?
Hey.
Oh, he is scrumptious.
[Sonny] My mom said I should apologize to you for cheating off you in class today.
T, I can't see.
What?
[Teel] I can't see why you'd feel like you'd have to.
It's totally cool, I understand.
Thanks for stopping by.
What are you doing?
What is that?
[Teel] Oh, it's nothing, I was just on the phone with my friend and...
Hey, Sonny, I thought that was you.
Come in, come in, come in for a few minutes.
I could scoop you and Terrance some ice cream.
Like old times.
[Sonny] Sure, that sounds great.
Wait.
Who's Terrance?
(laughs)
Well, hello there, Terrance.
[Teel] Ha, very funny.
Why didn't you call me?
I wanted to know what happened!
[Teel] I don't know, I just didn't feel like it.
I texted you like six times.
[Teel] I noticed.
Well, I saw those mean posts on your Facebook.
I wanted to know what's going on.
Why is your camera not on?
[Teel] Must be broken.
Okay, that is the stupidest lie I've ever heard.
[Teel] Seriously, it must be like a bug or something.
Whatever, turn it on.
[Teel] Can we just talk like this today?
No, why?
[Teel] To keep up the mystery.
Shut up and turn it on.
[Teel] I can't.
Are you naked or something?
[Teel] No.
Then turn it on!
Or I'm hanging up.
[Teel] Wait, wait, please don't hang up.
T.
Okay, seriously, I got my life back today.
I am officially ungrounded and I may never talk to you again so this might be your last chance.
[Teel] (sighs) Okay.
Oh my god.
T, what happened?
Nothing, I just fell.
On your face?
Repeatedly?
[Teel] I was playing some sports.
Some sports?
Yeah.
[Madison] T, did you get in a fight?
No.
[Madison] What else would make your face look like that?
A fight implies that I was an active participant.
[Madison] You got beat up?
By who?
Just a bunch of ass cavities.
[Madison] At your school?
Yeah.
Did you tell someone?
[Teel] No.
What did you tell your parents?
Could we talk about something else, please?
No, your face literally looks like a hamburger.
Mad, can we please talk about something else?
Okay.
Terrance.
And not that either.
I don't like it.
Come on, Terrance, I need to know your origin story.
Please?
I'm gonna keep calling you Terrance.
You're so annoying.
That's not very nice, Terrance.
Fine.
My dad started calling me Teel when I was a little kid because I would always run around the house wearing, like, a cape yelling "I'm the Man of Teel!"
I couldn't pronounce my Ss yet.
Oh!
Yeah, so now my mom is the only one who calls me Terrance and I hate it.
My name is Teel and that's what you should call me.
I can't call you T anymore?
T is fine.
Okay, so I need to hurry because Cole's performing at the school talent show tonight and my dad's giving, like, his last speech as principal or whatever.
He's all freaked out.
He just walked in on me while I was showering.
He couldn't wait 10 minutes to borrow my shaving cream?
I was all like "Dad, get out!"
And he's all like "Nothing I've never seen before."
Whatever.
I don't even care though because tonight I'm a free woman.
I am ungrounded!
Mad, I think you wear too much makeup.
That's not insulting.
No, no, don't freak out, please.
I just think you look better without makeup than with.
You've never seen me without makeup on!
[Teel] Actually, I have.
It was the accidental pool party?
That night?
Okay, so?
So I just think when you put on all that makeup, it hides everything that's beautiful about your face.
T, I have to wear some.
No, no, I know.
I just think you should wear less.
So we see more of you.
T, you can't do this to me right now!
Cole's gonna be there!
I know, I know, that's why I'm telling you.
I was already freaking out about seeing him.
And now you drop this on me?
I know.
Just let me help you.
What do you mean?
Let me help you put on your makeup.
No!
[Teel] Just try it for one day and if you don't like it, then you can go back to your old way.
What do you know about makeup?
My mom's a hairdresser who also does makeup, so I've been watching her since I was literally a little kid.
I can do this.
Fine.
Fine?
Fine!
Okay, good.
Now just look right into the camera and I'll tell you what to do.
No, like right into the camera.
Okay!
Good.
T!
Okay, okay.
Start with powder.
Powder?
I don't have any foundation on.
[Teel] You don't need it.
Yes, I do.
I am way too pale.
No, you don't, your skin is like flawless, it's the best feature of your face.
Plus, it's a good thing to be pale.
How?
You ever heard of Snow White?
You are such a nerd!
Trust me, less is more.
Good.
Now eyes.
Just a little shadow.
That's good, that's good.
Now mascara.
No, uh-uh.
I need eyeliner.
I have bug eyes.
Fine, fine, but it has to be the lightest brown you have.
Why would I use brown?
And it needs to be razor thin, so we don't even know we're seeing it.
Good.
Good.
And mascara?
[Teel] Unless you want to skip it.
No.
(laughs)
Okay, that's plenty.
What color blush do you have?
I use this one.
No, that's way too orange for you.
You want your cheeks to look like apples.
What about the red one?
This one?
[Teel] Yeah.
So I can look like a whore?
(laughs) You won't look like a whore, just don't put so much on.
You just brush it on really lightly, yeah.
(whines)
Good.
Now lips.
Not your usual red.
We're going regular lip gloss.
You are killing me.
Something shiny but without color.
Your lips are already perfect.
Yeah, that's great.
Now let me just look at you for a second.
(laughs)
Don't look at me like that, you're making me nervous!
Now I dare you to not look in the mirror for the whole day and just notice how people react to you.
Okay.
You look beautiful.
Shut up.
T!
Forward to tonight's performances.
As many of you know...
[Madison] It's my dad.
I'll be retiring in a few weeks.
[Madison] Droning on.
[Madison's Father] You're thrilled, I know.
I've spent time getting to know each and every one of you.
[Madison] It's Cole.
[Madison's Father] That means you, Chad Mendez.
I've always told you (mumbles)... ♪ I'm basking in sunshine on a rainy Wednesday night
♪ Nothing's impossible when you're here
♪ I take a look out the window and you'll see
♪ How long is it gonna rain?
♪ I just smile
Oh my god.
Okay, okay, okay.
I'm gonna do it.
There she goes.
Cole?
You were, like, amazing.
Thanks.
These are for you.
You were amazing.
I just sang what I felt, you know?
Yeah, totally.
Yeah, totally.
Wow, flowers.
Yeah.
Well, you look, you know, like.
Thank you.
Hey, you know, it sucks that your dad's retiring because he's like, he's the best.
Oh, no, that's 'cause he's not your dad.
But you know.
You still grounded and stuff?
No.
Well, my parents aren't home tonight and I wanted to know if you wanted to come over.
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, I could make time, yeah.
Cool, I'll text you.
Okay.
Okay.
Bye.
(laughs)
T!
You are a genius!
Oh, easy now.
Okay, Mr. Fashion Consultant.
You have to help me choose what to wear to Cole's for the big night.
You really think tonight's the big night?
Duh.
Didn't you hear that song?
It was totally about me.
We could do this shirt with jeans.
But then I'd have to wear a thong.
T, help!
What about the dress?
The dress?
The dress?
What am I, like 30?
At least try it on for me?
Okay.
Whoa, wait, whoa.
What are you doing?
A little shy, Mr. T?
No.
T, okay, when you have a girlfriend and you're gonna want to have sex with her, you're gonna have to see her naked.
Okay, well, for now can you please just go off screen or something?
Okay.
But you don't know what you're missing!
(blows)
Wear that.
Really?
Yes, really.
It's ridiculously gorgeous, wear it.
I'm sorry, T, I'm gonna have to use my veto power here.
This shows more skin.
T, I can't believe this is happening.
Please be careful, Mad.
Okay, Dad.
Who else is here?
I hear music.
(knocks)
Mad, you made it!
[Madison] Hi.
Hi.
I guess it could have been worse.
(laughs) It was worse.
Oh yeah.
Oh yeah, I forgot, Cole and Sophie, they had sex.
With Sophie Sophie?
Are you effing kidding me?
How convenient, right?
Apparently after they dropped me off, they went back to his house and had sex.
Big fat betrayal sex.
[Teel] How do you know?
Oh, it's all over Facebook.
And when I tried to talk to her about it, she full on lies to my face.
You know, Mad, I think it's for the best.
How?
Because you don't want your first time to be some hookup at a party.
It was not a hookup!
It was Cole.
And besides, it was not my, no.
What?
It wasn't what?
Your first time?
Madison, are you keeping secrets?
Madison!
(laughs) Oh.
How could you not tell me that?
Who did you have sex with?
I can't do this!
I can't do this!
I keep trying and I keep messing it up!
I'm sure they're fine.
No, they're not, they're not fine!
They're not fine, they have to be perfect!
My dad is gonna see them and they have to be perfect.
[Teel] He's not gonna mind.
No, it has to be perfect!
I'm starting over.
Hey, look, Mads.
Stop.
Let me see.
Let me see.
What?
It has a smudge right there!
It looks great.
No, they don't.
Mad, Cole's an idiot.
I can't imagine what he was thinking.
You're so much prettier than Sophie.
I'm not pretty.
You're right, you're not pretty, you're beautiful.
Shut up.
I mean it.
You're intelligent and beautiful...
You're an intelligent and beautiful girl.
Woman.
Woman, even, Mad.
You're an intelligent and beautiful woman who's fun and funny and interesting and mysterious.
And beautiful.
You said that three times.
It was four.
By the way, I have 37 Facebook friends.
[Madison] That's great.
I have an audition this week.
You didn't tell me that.
It's not really a big deal.
[Madison] No spontaneous trips to grandma's house?
I found a way around that.
[Madison] How?
I'm not going to tell my mom.
What's the part?
Romeo.
That's a big part.
Sure you can handle that?
Well, you know, I memorized the speech but I don't really know what else to do.
You show me.
No.
Oh yeah.
After my whole ordeal with Cole, you don't think I deserve some entertainment?
Come on.
Fine.
You and your ways.
Okay, but for tonight's performance of Romeo and Juliet, the role of Juliet will be played by the lovely and talented Miss Madison Daniels.
Okay.
Oh, and I figure the scene is more funny than serious because he's not like this big romantic, he's just horny and wants to see Juliet's boobs.
Wow.
Okay.
Here goes.
(gasps) But soft!
What light through yonder window breaks?
It is the east and Juliet is the sun.
Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon who is already sick and pale with grief that thou her maid art far more fair than she!
Be not her maid, since she is envious!
Her vestal livery is but sick and green and none but fools do wear it.
Cast it off!
It is my lady.
(sighs) It is my love!
(laughs)
See how she leans her cheek upon her hand.
Oh, but I were a glove upon that hand that I might touch that cheek.
That's it.
So did it suck that bad?
No.
That didn't suck.
That didn't suck at all.
(rings)
It's late.
Why are you calling me?
Were you asleep?
Yeah.
Do you know what time it is?
Well, wake up, because I have something to show you.
I'm up, I just can't promise I'll stay up.
[Madison] I think I can keep you up.
We'll see.
We will see.
So, what?
T, don't rush me.
Mad, I'm really tired.
I want to go back to bed.
You wish.
You're being weird.
Good night.
No, T, wait, wait!
T, give me a sec.
I'm just gonna put my head down right here.
So I've been thinking.
I've been thinking a lot about what you said.
Whatever it was, it sure was brilliant.
How I shouldn't try to have sex with idiots, especially Cole.
It's good to be idiot-free.
I agree.
I was also thinking about you.
I'm flattered.
I was thinking about you a lot.
And how you're not an idiot.
So...
This...
Is for you.
(slow music)
Uh, what are you doing?
Seriously, Mad.
Just enjoy it.
Do you like it?
Uh...
I'll take that as a yes.
Madison, don't.
Don't be a prude.
Mad, Mad, stop, seriously.
This is not, I'm not watching this!
I'm not watching.
Why not?
[Teel] Because it's weird and desperate.
Weird and desperate?
Yeah.
You're an ass!
What?
I'm trying to give you something!
My own personal internet porn?
Is that what this is?
Well, Mad, that's what it feels like.
So I disgust you.
No, no, you don't disgust me.
Then what?
We're friends and you wanna stay friends?
Well, yeah.
Fuck you.
Wait.
What?
(dings)
(dings)
(rings)
What?
I'm sorry.
Okay.
I'll hold onto that while I cry myself to sleep.
I mean it.
I didn't even know you liked me.
Yeah right.
Mad, I'm serious.
I figured you'd be out chasing all the gorgeous popular guys.
T, you're gorgeous.
No, I'm not.
T, yes, you are.
And you're sweet.
And you actually listen to what I say.
What did you expect?
I don't know.
[Madison] First you internet stalk me, then you have all these deep conversations with me, then you're all like "You're beautiful and intelligent
"and Cole's an idiot."
He is an idiot.
Yeah, well, you are too.
Yeah, I guess I am.
Then why do I feel like the idiot?
Look, Mad, I've been driving around all night trying to decide whether to tell you this.
Wait, driving?
My mom's afraid to practice with me, so sometimes when I can't sleep, I take my grandma's car around the neighborhood.
Rebel.
I don't really like girls.
I'm hanging up now.
No, no, wait, Mad, I mean it.
You don't get it.
I don't really like any girls that way.
Because...
Oh, crap.
I like boys.
What?
Yeah.
I think I might be, you know.
That's convenient.
Mad, I mean it.
You're the first person I've ever told.
Wait, really?
Really.
I've been wanting to tell you for like a really long time but I didn't know when or how to bring it up.
Well, this was perfect timing.
I'm sorry.
Are you...
Are you sure?
I'm not really sure about anything.
Then how do you know?
Well, I mean, there aren't really girls that I think about more than any others except for you.
But then I just think about, you know, what we're going to talk about next time we see each other.
Not other stuff.
Do you think about other stuff with boys?
Yeah, kind of all the time.
Oh.
Like, you know.
Sonny.
Wait, him?
Yeah.
Him.
A lot.
I can see why.
Me and him used to be such good friends when we were kids.
But then we both changed so much and he became really good at sports and I became really good at watching him play sports.
(laughs)
T.
Is this why they beat you up?
Yeah.
Well, yes and no.
[Madison] What do you mean?
Well, it was because of Sonny.
Wait, he beat you up?
No, no, no, no, it was his friends.
[Madison] He didn't.
Well...
You remember when he came over to my house after I helped him cheat?
You said you didn't.
[Teel] Yeah, that's what I said.
Okay.
Well, ice cream with my mom was perfectly awkward.
But then we started talking about this card game that we used to play when we were kids, Magic?
And it turned out that he was still really bummed about this card he traded me, like, years ago.
And so I told him that I still had it.
So we went up to my room and I gave it back to him.
And then we started looking at all the other cards and kind of looking at each one
and reliving some of our old battles.
(laughs)
And then I honestly don't know how it happened but there was this, like, tingly electric gravity
between us and it kept pulling us closer and closer together.
And then suddenly we were kissing.
(gasps)
I know, I was, like, shocked too.
It was literally like every fantasy I ever had was coming true in one simultaneous moment.
And so we kept kissing for like five minutes and then, you know, both of us getting more and more into it.
And then really suddenly, he pulled away.
Like super abruptly.
And he got out of there as fast as he could.
He didn't say anything to me as he was leaving, but, Mad, for those five minutes, it was like magic.
T!
So what happened though?
He completely ignored me the next day at school, so I tried texting him.
But he was just like "Who is this, how'd you get my number?"
So I mustered up the courage to go talk to him after school.
Well, I wasn't gonna show you this, but whatever.
Here.
Hey, Mad, I know you're in school right now but I wanted to show you my latest triumph.
I think I'm gonna go try to talk to Sonny again.
Wish me luck.
Hey.
Hey.
[Teel] So biology sucked today, huh?
Yeah.
Listen, I gotta go.
[Teel] I was actually wondering if maybe we could...
Hey, that that fag you were talking about?
Yeah.
I don't know what he wants, but he's not gonna find it here.
I think I know what he wants.
[Teel] Can we go somewhere and talk?
We have nothing to talk about.
[Teel] I just was...
Whoa!
Get away!
Get away, assbag.
[Teel] Get off of me!
That was a mistake.
[Teel] Get off!
Like that?
Oh, Sonny, Sonny, I want you so bad!
(laughs)
(crying)
T.
Yeah.
T, I can't believe they would do that.
Is this gonna be weird now?
[Madison] Us?
Yeah.
[Madison] No, T.
Yeah, it's gonna be totally weird.
This is why I didn't tell you for so long, Mad, because I knew things would get all weird.
No.
No, they're not weird.
Yeah, well, if you say so.
T, I'm serious.
You gotta give me a break.
I just found out tonight while I was in my underwear.
(rings)
T, wake up.
I have an idea.
Don't you ever sleep?
What if you start a gay-straight alliance at your school?
No way.
I looked and there aren't any in your area.
You could connect to other gay kids at your school.
You could maybe even help them out.
Yeah, help them get the crap kicked out of them.
No, T, that's the whole point of GSA, so that wouldn't happen.
I'm sorry, not interested.
T, you need support.
Look, I really appreciate what you're trying to do but I'm not ready for that.
T, you can't just sit there and suffer.
All by yourself.
Yeah, I can.
[Madison] No, T, you need to tell someone.
I did.
No, someone other than me.
People need to know so that they can help you.
They're the ones who need help.
Fine.
Fine, then make them deal with you.
Mad, stop pushing me, okay?
I'm not pushing you.
I don't want to be your cause anymore.
You're not my cause, you're my friend.
Then stop friending me so hard.
T, just look at the website I'm sending to you.
You just posted that on my wall.
[Madison] So what?
So now everyone's gonna think I'm gay.
[Madison] No, T, it's just a link.
It's a link to a gay website, Mad!
It's for straight people too.
You don't, you don't send that to someone unless you think they're gay!
You are gay.
Well, I'm sorry if I don't want to flaunt my sexuality all over the internet like some people I know.
Why are you being such a jerk?
Because you just outed me to all my friends!
What friends, T?
You have like 78 acquaintances on Facebook who don't even see your feed because you don't post anything.
T.

Here we are at my dad's retirement party.
Wow, look at those amazing decorations.
Aren't they incredible?
Oh, but the cake.
Oh yeah, the cake, yummy.
I wonder who made it?
Shh, I won't tell if you don't.
Obviously, all these people are here because of my expertly designed invitations.
Well, almost everybody.
I wish my friend Teel was here.
But we can't have it all now, can we?
(dings)
(dings)
(dings)
(rings)
Hey.
What's with the cards?
Okay.
It's alright.
There's a smudge on that one.
(laughs)
Mad, you don't need to be fixed.
Mad, really, it's alright.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You used to make me climb around the back because supposedly the front was being guarded.
I'd get all these scratches all over my arms from the bark.
(crying)
Me too.
Yeah, I know.
What do you mean?
(knocking)
[Madison's Father] Maddie, it's almost nine!
Okay, Daddy!
Wait, what are you talking about?
Keep watching what?
Madison.
Okay, I promise.
You're kinda starting to freak me out.
Madison.
Madison!
(crying)
(door creaks)
Stop.
Stop.
(crying)
Hi, I'd like to report a crime.
(rings)
You shouldn't have done that.
Are you okay?
What happened, did the cops come?
Did they arrest him?
Yeah, they came.
And my dad cleared things up.
It was all a misunderstanding.
What do you mean, cleared it up?
Didn't you tell them?
I told them that I made it up.
What?
T, I don't think we should be talking anymore, okay?
Madison, what the hell?
I have to be there for my dad right now.
He's going through a lot, so...
[Teel] No, no, Madison.
You need to do something.
Good luck with the show.
Wait, Madison!
Madison!
Alack, there lies more peril...
Alack, there lies more...
Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye... (sighs)
(calm music)
(laughs)
Hey, sweetie.
Mom.
Sorry, knock knock.
You need a ride to rehearsal?
No, Karina and Sydney are picking me up.
Also I think everyone's going to go out afterwards, so I might be home late.
You know, grandma's coming to your opening tomorrow.
Okay.
I'm very proud of you.
Mom, gotta run my lines.
Okay, I'm going.
(mumbles) Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye than in 20 of their swords.
(sighs)
Obviously all these people are here because of my expertly designed invitations.
Well, almost everybody.
I wish my friend Teel was here.
But...
I wish my friend Teel was here.
I wish my friend Teel was here.
But we can't have it all now, can we?
Hey, Mad!
Right now I am on the run.
I stole my grandma's car and a bunch of money from my dad's sock drawer and I told my director a whole story about having, like, a dire family emergency and he bought the whole thing.
It turns out I'm a pretty good actor.
(laughs) And now here I am on the road.
I know it's a little bit extreme, but you're not taking my calls.
So California here I come.
Apparently there are nothing but trees in Illinois.
Oh, look, a field.
I guess that's the end of that...
Oh my god, a field!
Mad, if you don't pick up,
I'm gonna be forced to do something drastic.
(screams)
Oh man, it's so pretty.
Hey, Mad, really wish you would talk to me right now.
I'm trying to stay awake over here.
Nothing a caffeinated beverage can't fix.
(sighs)
(dings)
Oh, it's my mom.
She's probably freaking out.
I bet she's called the cops like three times.
This could be a very pointless trip.
19 messages from my mom, six from my dad.
And yes, they have called the cops, so congratulations, Mad.
You've officially turned me into a fugitive.
Morning, Mad!
I hope you're seeing this.
I never knew it would be so beautiful.
(camera clicking)
(upbeat music)
Hey, Mad.
Just got here.
The GPS sent me on kind of a wild goose chase and then I realized that you're on South Maple and not North Maple, and those are very different addresses.
(rings)
Oh, you're calling me.
Guess where I am right now...
T, you shouldn't have come here!
Go home!
I figured you might say that, but...
My dad is right downstairs!
Don't worry, I'm coming around the back.
What are you doing?
[Teel] I'm coming up.
No!
T!
Oh my god.
Oh my god, T, no.
T!
No!
Shh!
Oh my god, T.
T, no way.
T, you're gonna kill yourself.
[Teel] What else is new?
[Madison] Oh my god, no.
[Teel] Hey.
If my dad sees you, he will kill you.
Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye than in 20 of their swords.
You have to leave.
Oh, will thou leave me so unsatisfied?
What do you want?
The exchange of thy love's faithful vow from mine.
[Madison's Father] Maddie?
I'll be right down, Dad!
I had to see you in person.
No, T.
I already told you that I can't talk to you anymore.
No, we can go to the police again and tell them everything.
No, they won't believe me, no.
[Teel] They'll believe me.
No.
[Teel] I'll be with you the whole time.
I said no.
Why?
Madison.
(crying) Look, he's not a monster, okay?
Yes, he is.
No, he's not, you don't know him!
You don't know him!
Okay, okay.
No, I can't.
I can't, okay?
I can't turn him in, I can't.
[Teel] I just need you to come with me so we can find some help.
No.
He will send the National Guard, you don't get it.
He shouldn't be doing that to you.
Better that I learn from him than some jerkoff boy who doesn't love me!
He doesn't love you.
Yes, he does!
Do you remember how you helped me?
When I didn't have any friends?
You remember that?
Now I have 142 Facebook friends.
Mad, can you believe that?
I never could have been able to do that without you.
Do you know what I was doing on the first night that I called you?
I was planning to commit suicide.
Right after you left, I took an entire bottle of acetaminophen.
And then you called back.
You remember that?
You called me back from the party because I was lonely or something.
And then suddenly I had one friend and that was enough.
T, I had no idea.
Well, I didn't want you to know that it was that bad.
I was mostly just so amazed that this beautiful, brave, smart girl wanted to talk to me.
You helped me so much.
It's okay to need help.
142 Facebook friends?
[Teel] Acquaintances.
I wish we'd made it to 150.
(knocks)
[Teel] We gotta go.
[Madison's Father] Maddie, what's going on in there?
Nothing, Dad.
[Madison's Father] Why's the door locked?
It's locked?
[Teel] You gotta come with me, Mad.
I can't.
[Madison's Father] Madison, is there a boy in there?
No, Dad, no!
[Madison's Father] Open the goddamn door!
He's gonna kill you.
I'm not afraid.
[Madison's Father] Madison!
Dad, stop, please!
Oh my god.
[Madison's Father] Open this door immediately.
No, I can't go.
I can't do this.
It's okay.
You can.
No, T.
You're my best friend.
[Madison's Father] (banging) Madison!
(rings)
Hey.
Hi.
How you doing?
I'm okay.
Today's been one of the better days.
[Teel] Good.
Yeah.
How's your audition?
Some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrust upon them.
You are such a drama queen.
Hey, where are you right now?
Don't be nosy.
Close your eyes.
Why?
Just close your eyes.
Okay.
Tada!
What is it?
What does it look like?
It's a cape.
Oh my god.
That is amazing.
Where were you when I was seven?
T.
I just wanted to say thank you.
To you and your parents for being there for me these past few months, through the courts and...
Mad, you don't have to say that.
Just let me finish.
You saved me.
You're my Man of Teel.
Mad.
I don't know what to say.
Don't say anything.
Just pose.
(laughs)
Oh no.
No!
You're not actually gonna post that, are you?
No.
This one's just for us.

No.
Are you nervous?
No.
(Door opening)
(Footsteps)
Are you comfortable?
Yes.
Yes, sir.
Thank you.
- You're not cold?
- No.
- This house gets very cold.
- I'm thick-skinned.
You'll find that there can be a fraught.
Won't be like what you're used to.
You ought to keep to the house.
But I don't mind the fresh air.
You'll be more comfortable in the house.
I like the fresh air.
- I like being outside...
- Take it off.
Your nightdress, take it off.
(Wind howling)
(Wincing)
(Wincing)
(Men laughing and chatting)
(Clock chiming)
So you'll not go to London, then?
What?
My son will stay here with his wife and play master or something.
(Laughter)
Excuse me.
Good night.
(Father-in-law) You're very tired lately, Katherine.
You will wait up for your husband.
I am perhaps a little overtired, sir.
You will wait up, Katherine.
I will try, sir.
Sit with Mrs Lester, see that she doesn't fall asleep.
I'm awake.
Stop staring, Anna.
- But Mr Lester said...
- I know what Mr Lester said but I'm awake so there's no need to stare at me.
(Footsteps)
(Door opening)
Stand up.
Stand!
Leave.
Stop smiling.
Take your nightdress off.
Face the wall.
(Unbuttoning his fly)
Face the wall!
(Husband masturbating)
(Moaning)
(Sighting)
'Where has my husband gone?
'
Away.
- Away?
- That's what I said.
- To do what?
- Nothing for you to concern yourself with.
But I do concern myself.
There's been an explosion, at the colliery at Amble.
An explosion?
- How did that happen?
- Yes, Katherine.
An explosion.
I leave for London this morning.
You'll be on your own for a while.
Perhaps you will find that your energy is restored after a little of your own company, and when your husband returns you can resume your duties with more rigor, madam.

- Just taking a break, ma'am.
- On my husband's time?
We'll get straight back to it.
(Choked sobbing)
We're weighing a pig, ma'am.
Weighing a sow, to be precise.
A sow?
- As you see.
- (Anna squeals)
Take her down.
I said, take her down!
Face the wall.
And stop smiling.
(Chains rattling)
May we turn around yet, ma'am?
How much would I weigh?
Would you like me to check?
Guess.
You have wasted quite enough of my husband's good time and money.
I shall be keeping an eye on you gentlemen.
Anna?
- Ma'am, if I can explain...
- What was his name?
The one that called you a pig, what was his name?
- Sebastian, ma'am.
- Is he new?
Yes, ma'am.
He's the new groomsman.
Is there something else, Anna?
No, ma'am.
(Sobbing)
My boots, Anna.
- It's still cold out there.
- It's warm enough.
- Mr Lester said that you weren't to...
- Yes?
- It's going to rain today, ma'am.
- Good.
(Dog barking)
Are you lost?
House is in the other direction.
Mrs Lester!
(Thunder rumbling)
- Anna, it's too hot.
- Your skin's too cold.
Ow!
It only feels too hot because the cold's got into your bones.
If it feels too hot, then it is too hot.
Anna, you're hurting me.
Anna!
Anna, stop it!
What's wrong with you?
- Sorry, I...
- You've made my skin all red.
- You'll catch a fever, ma'am.
- It's just a bit of fresh air, Anna.
And there's no need for you to stare at me currently, is there?
It's unnerving.
(Footsteps)
(Knock at door)
I'm terribly bored, Mrs Lester.
You should dedicate more time to your work.
- Aren't you bored, Katherine?
- You can't call me that.
Get out.
Get out!
What do you want?
No!
No!
Shh, shh.
(Door opening)
(Sniggering)
(Laughing)
(Katherine moaning)
You must be anticipating the return of your father-in-law, Mrs Lester.
- And your husband.
- I must.
It is not good to be without company for too long.
- The decline in your health...
- My health?
Your absence from church, madam.
No doubt brought on by their absence.
No doubt.
Perhaps a little more time spent indoors, Mrs Lester.
I understand you've been taking the air.
Perhaps a little more solitude and reflection will do.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
(Dog barking)
It's early for you, Anna.
I said, it's early for you, Anna.
And for you, sir.
Ah, she speaks!
Not so.
Got to give dogs a run-around.
A bitch gets restless if she's tied up too long.
She was, sir.
Was what?
Tied up too long.
Mr Lester wouldn't be happy if he knew what was happening in his absence.
What's been happening in his absence, Anna?
The dogs, sir.
Thank you, Anna.
I'll look into that.
It's good of you to keep such a close eye on things.
(Katherine laughing)
Mr Lester has returned.
- My husband?
- No, ma'am.
- Where is he?
- He's gone up to the fields.
He said not to expect him till dinner.
(Gasping)
(Footsteps)
Katherine.
Welcome home, sir.
- Have you kept well?
- I have.
Thank you, sir.
You haven't been running the house in my absence.
I have.
That wasn't a question.
- Where's your husband?
- Wherever you put him.
(Sniggers)
I'm so sorry.
- You've heard nothing from him?
- Not a word.
Get a bottle of the Flurried.
- He wants a Flurried.
- There's none of that left.
- None of it?
- Not a drop.
She's drank it all.
Excuse me, sir, but there's none of the Flurried left.
That's impossible.
Look again.
I'm afraid there's none left, sir.
Cook said it had all gone.
And how exactly has it all gone?
I don't know, sir.
- You don't know?
- No, sir.
And the cook, does she not know?
No, sir.
Do you not think it necessary to keep an account of what happens to my property in this household?
All my property.
- Am I to assume you drank it?
- No, sir.
And yet you can offer no other explanation.
No, sir.
Get down.
- Sir?
- On your hands and knees.
You behave like an animal, and I'll treat you like an animal.
Now, get out.
(Footsteps)
(Grunting and groaning)
Lock him up.
(Groaning)
Sebastian?
(Rattling)
(Grunts)
I have no desire to see you, until I've had time to consider what to do with you.
Let him out.
- You are entirely without shame.
- I have nothing to be ashamed of.
Nothing to be ashamed of?
Do you have any idea of the damage that you're capable of bringing upon this family?
You have failed miserably in all of your marital duties, more specifically, to provide your husband with a legitimate heir.
Where is your son?
Where is he?
He has made that impossible.
Let him out.
You've had enough time to contemplate, I hope, and to take the opportunity to meditate upon your duties as a wife, Katherine, in this household above anything else.
Give me the key or let him out.
(Glass shattering)
Leave it!
I cannot bear to look at you.
Sit.
Sit.
Eat.
- I'm not...
- Eat with me.
I hate to eat alone.
Tell me about your family, Anna.
Tell me about your home.
I haven't been home in a very long time.
I'm not sure I know what home is.
- Do you have any brothers?
Anna?
- (Mr Lester choking)
Do you have any brothers?
How many sisters do you have?
He's...
We should...
What are the names of your sisters?
Sit back down, Anna.
- No, he needs...
- Sit down!
(Banging on door)
(Muffled cries)
(Banging)
(Rattling)
(Thud, then silence)
Run to the village for a doctor.
Quick, go.
Shh, shh.
(Groans)
(Anna sobbing)
(Katherine) 'He'll not return for the funeral.
He said as much.'
We won't have long.
He won't come back.
He hated his father.
He hates me.
Perhaps he just won't come back.
(Shutter clicking)
There.
Very fine indeed.
Man of the house.
Anna?
Anna!
Anna, when you are spoken to, you are to respond.
I'm going to ask one of the maids, um... that young girl, to prepare and bring me breakfast and all my meals from now on.
Just as a precaution.
It could be the mushrooms or his heart.
Nobody's blaming you so don't be so hard on yourself.
You're careful.
He was old and he had a weak stomach.
You heard what Dr Burton said.
The master will be home before long and this will all be done with.
Anna, I wish that you would speak again.
Promise you'll try.
(Katherine) She won't speak.
She's mute.
- What if it comes back?
- It won't.
Do you love me?
Of course.
Do you adore me?
Of course.
Could you do without me?
Could you do without me?
It's husbands and wives that kiss like that.
Did you husband kiss you, Katherine?
She won't speak.
You know I shan't be parted from you alive, Sebastian?
"Through hell and high water I will follow you,"
"to the cross, to the prison, to the grave, to the sky."
I'd rather stop you breathing than have you doubt how I feel.
(Clip-clop of hooves)
Sebastian.
He's come home.
- What time is it?
- My husband has returned.
What shall we do?
Sebastian?
Can you just shut up?
(Laughing)
- You look like a little boy.
- Just shut up for one second.
Let me think.
- Go out there.
- Go out there?
Why?
Am I to pretend to be your lady-in-fucking-waiting?
Just go out there.
(Footsteps)
You're home.
You're awake.
I heard the horse.
I walked it down the lane.
I'm surprised you heard.
I've been sleeping lightly, ever since your father died.
We had to have his funeral in your absence.
Couldn't let him rot in a corner, could you?
I shall place my feet on his grave in the morning.
Do you have the bed made up for two every night?
Ever since your letter came I had no indication of when you'd return.
And thank goodness I did.
You must be tired.
No.
I found it in the fields.
And decided to keep it?
- Holds my skirts up.
- Are you skirts in danger of falling down?
No, sir.
You've grown fatter.
The cook has made an effort to find food to my taste perhaps.
Your face is fatter.
You're altogether larger than when I left.
Perhaps you'd like some tea.
(Crockery rattling)
So... you have become a whore in my absence, Katherine.
You think me to be stupid, perhaps.
But perhaps you had no idea that your whoring had been noticed.
You seem surprised.
And surprised that the news of you opening your legs and your cunt for any worthless dog should have reached my ears, but then you opened your legs so very wide, Katherine.
And you've acted so very shamelessly and so very stupidly.
And you've begun to smell, Katherine.
You've gotten so fat and foul-smelling, it was inevitable that the whole county would hear of your behaviour.
My father... bought you,
along with a piece of land not fit enough for a cow to graze upon.
I do not like being talked about, madam.
I do not like being laughed at.
I do not like owning a whore.
You will alter your behaviour, madam.
And how will I alter my behaviour, sir?
You will never see that man again.
He will be sent from this house and you will remain here, indoors with your prayer book.
(Screaming)
(Neighing)
(Sobbing)
I can't sleep.
Try.
I've tried.
Can you sleep?
- I'll sit up until you can.
- I can't.
Every time I close my eyes, I see his face.
Can you just get off me?
How can you, just like it was before?
It's making me sick.
I feel sick, constantly.
It won't end unless you let it.
Have you let it?
For you, and for me.
Sebastian, he was going to kill you.
He was weak.
We did it so that we could be together here.
No more bowing and not being who you deserve to be.
- You did it for us?
- We did it.
(Carriage approaching)
- I'm sorry.
I'm not sure I understand.
- Teddy was your husband's ward.
- Who's Teddy?
- This is Teddy.
- I'm sorry.
You're repeating yourself.
- It's a shock.
- I understand.
- My husband had no ward.
Mr Lester knew my daughter very well some time ago and was fond of her.
He fathered a child by her.
- I beg your pardon?
- After my daughter's death... he did the honorable thing and made Teddy his ward.
He has been with us lately.
At Amble, near the colliery.
I'm afraid this is impossible.
He was careful to draw up papers.
I'm sorry for the shock.
You needn't apologise for an impossibility.
Sorry you've had a wasted journey.
Given Mr Lester's recent demise...
My husband is not deceased.
- He is assumed so.
- He is missing.
But presumed dead.
He is missing and apparently you saw him so soon.
We did.
Perhaps you can advise me as to what has become of him.
He seemed very well.
And certain he was to come here next.
He said it was a matter of urgency.
We can't imagine what has happened to him.
I'm terribly anxious.
I'm sure.
There are papers, Mrs Lester.
I am sorry.
Perhaps we might have tea.
What is it?
He says you're the prettiest lady he has ever seen.
- She's lying.
- She has papers.
She's forged them, then.
You don't think that every man and woman in the county with half a brain and an empty pocket isn't coming up with a similar scheme?
She has legitimate papers.
I thought you said he couldn't fuck you.
He couldn't.
Or wouldn't.
Katherine?
What?
Sorry, er...
I wasn't...
- You were saying?
- I was saying it might be best if Teddy took your room.
Then he's next to my room, and it's larger.
You don't need all that space.
- No.
- No?
No, no, I...
No, I don't need all that space.
After Christmas, then.
Yes.
And perhaps I'll take your room.
You'll be used to smaller spaces from your days in your tiny house, Agnes.
(Gasping)
Katherine!
Can I come?
What are those ones?
Swallows.
Look, watch them glide.
Aren't they beautiful?
I think you're beautiful.
How do you know that?
What?
Names of birds.
My mother taught me.
She'd take us on long walks and teach us the names of birds and trees.
- Outside things?
- Yes.
Do you miss your mother?
Yes.
Do you?
Yes.
(Rustling)
You don't mind if I...
if I join you, do you?
I just want to walk a little with you, Anna.
I won't scare you.
Promise.
(Door opening)
Get off me.
I need to talk to you.
Go back to your house and your little master.
Please come inside.
I can't...
If I come inside, then we're found out.
And if we're found out, then I'll hang.
While that boy's here, I'm out here.
That's the end of it.
Get out!
(Teddy laughing)
(Katherine) Sebastian!
Katherine, watch me.
- Watch me.
- Not now, Teddy.
- Please, please!
- Get off!
Leave me alone!
Sebastian!
Sebastian.
(Knock at door)
Sebastian?
Sebastian?
Ma'am.
- What is it?
- I'm sorry, ma'am, but it's the boy.
We can't find him anywhere.
- Teddy?
- Teddy?
Teddy?
Teddy?
- Teddy?
- Teddy?
Teddy?
Teddy?
(Door opening)
(Rapid footsteps)
- Teddy!
- He was at the waterfall.
He's freezing.
- Get some blankets.
- Who are you?
How dare you walk into this house and give orders?
Get out.
- I saved him.
- Get out!
(Teddy coughing)
(Agnes) Teddy, Teddy.
I will not stay here and be humiliated for the sake of that boy.
- Sebastian...
- I will not!
Tell me what to do.
I will do anything.
- It's too late.
- What?
What do you mean?
I stood in front of him, Katherine.
At that waterfall, that... perfect drop.
One step behind him.
And I...
It's too late.
It doesn't have to be.
It doesn't have to be if you trust me.
(Teddy groaning)
(Door opening)
(Teddy coughing)
You should go to bed.
I can't.
One of us should get some sleep.
I wouldn't sleep.
Lie down for a while.
I'll sit up with him.
You need some rest and he'll need you when he wakes up.
- Just for an hour or so.
- If you like.
Thank you.
(Coughing)
- Katherine.
- Shh, Teddy.
Sleep.
- What are you doing?
- Shh.
- Let me go.
Katherine.
- Shh.
(Muffled cries)
(Muffled cries)
(Teddy falls silent)
It is done.
Sebastian.
No, no, no.
Go wait until I come.
Go.
(Door opening)
(Door closing)
(Sobbing)
(Katherine) I must've fallen asleep for ten minutes, perhaps.
When I woke, he wasn't breathing.
Can you remember what time that was, Mrs Lester?
Just before the girl came in.
Er...
I couldn't say exactly.
Five, perhaps.
- I was upset.
- Of course.
(Agnes crying)
I wonder...
What?
Could you have been asleep longer than you thought?
Might someone have taken the opportunity to come in?
- There were bruises...
- From the waterfall.
They weren't there before.
- When I woke, the boy was dead.
- Katherine...
He must've got the bruises from the waterfall.
- Dr Burden says not.
- Can Dr Burden swear to W?
- Have we not suffered enough?
- Mrs Lester...
Forgive me.
- (Detective) Mrs Lester, you do realise...
- (Door opening)
We killed the boy.
(Detective) I beg your pardon, sir.
Who are you?
(Sebastian) She killed him.
She held a pillow over his face and I held his legs.
She killed Alexander Lester.
She killed Boris Lester, poisoned him with mushrooms and let him die.
She... killed that boy.
She killed that boy so that we could be together.
And I thought I loved her.
She suffocated me.
She suffocated me and she hounded me.
And then she never let me be.
She's a disease.
(Detective) Mrs Lester?
He's lying.
Anna...
He and Anna did it.
- For whatever reason of their own.
- You bitch!
Everyone knows that she picks the mushrooms and he follows her to the woods every morning.
Perhaps they were found out and threatened with separation.
My father-in-law beat him within an inch of his life the clay before he died.
And that boy...
That boy was like a child to me.
Anna will say if otherwise.
I did nothing.
Praise to the Lord
Who o'er all things so wondrously reigneth
Shelters he under his wings
Yet so gently sustaineth
Hast thou not seen
How thy desires ever have been
Granted in what he ordaineth
Are you cold?
No.
Are you nervous?
No.
Are you comfortable?
Yes.
Yes, sir.
Thank you.
- You're not cold?
- No.
- This house gets very cold.
- I'm thick-skinned.
You'll find that there can be a draught.
Won't be like what you're used to.
You ought to keep to the house.
But I don't mind the fresh air.
You'll be more comfortable in the house.
I like the fresh air.
- I like being outside...
- Take it off.
Your nightdress, take it off.
So you'll not go to London, then?
What?
My son will stay here with his wife and play master or something.
Excuse me.
Good night.
You're very tired lately, Katherine.
You will wait up for your husband.
I am perhaps a little overtired, sir.
You will wait up, Katherine.
I will try, sir.
Sit with Mrs. Lester, see that she doesn't fall asleep.
I'm awake.
Stop staring, Anna.
- But Mr. Lester said...
- I know what Mr. Lester said but I'm awake so there's no need to stare at me.
Stand up.
Stand!
Leave.
Stop smiling.
Take your nightdress off.
Face the wall.
Face the wall!
'Where has my husband gone?
'
Away.
- Away?
- That's what I said.
- To do what?
- Nothing for you to concern yourself with.
But I do concern myself.
There's been an explosion, at the colliery at Amble.
An explosion?
- How did that happen?
- Yes, Katherine.
An explosion.
I leave for London this morning.
You'll be on your own for a while.
Perhaps you will find that your energy is restored after a little of your own company, and when your husband returns you can resume your duties with more rigour, madam.
- Just taking a break, ma'am.
- On my husband's time?
We'll get straight back to it.
We're weighing a pig, ma'am.
Weighing a sow, to be precise.
A sow?
As you see.
Take her down.
I said, take her down!
Face the wall.
And stop smiling.
May we turn around yet, ma'am?
How much would I weigh?
Would you like me to check?
Guess.
You have wasted quite enough of my husband's good time and money.
I shall be keeping an eye on you gentlemen.
Anna?
- Ma'am, if I can explain...
- What was his name?
The one that called you a pig, what was his name?
- Sebastian, ma'am.
- Is he new?
Yes, ma'am.
He's the new groomsman.
Is there something else, Anna?
No, ma'am.
My boots, Anna.
- It's still cold out there.
- It's warm enough.
- Mr. Lester said that you weren't to...
- Yes?
- It's going to rain today, ma'am.
- Good.
Are you lost?
House is in the other direction.
Mrs. Lester!
- Anna, it's too hot.
- Your skin's too cold.
Ow!
It only feels too hot because the cold's got into your bones.
If it feels too hot, then it is too hot.
Anna, you're hurting me.
Anna!
Anna, stop it!
What's wrong with you?
- Sorry, I...
- You've made my skin all red.
- You'll catch a fever, ma'am.
- It's just a bit of fresh air, Anna.
And there's no need for you to stare at me currently, is there?
It's unnerving.
I'm terribly bored, Mrs. Lester.
You should dedicate more time to your work.
- Aren't you bored, Katherine?
- You can't call me that.
Get out.
Get out!
What do you want?
No!
No!
Shh, shh.
You must be anticipating the return of your father-in-law, Mrs. Lester.
- And your husband.
- I must.
It is not good to be without company for too long.
- The decline in your health...
- My health?
Your absence from church, madam.
No doubt brought on by their absence.
No doubt.
Perhaps a little more time spent indoors, Mrs. Lester.
I understand you've been taking the air.
Perhaps a little more solitude and reflection will do.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
It's early for you, Anna.
I said, it's early for you, Anna.
And for you, sir.
Ah, she speaks!
Not so.
Got to give dogs a run-around.
A bitch gets restless if she's tied up too long.
She was, sir.
Was what?
Tied up too long.
Mr. Lester wouldn't be happy if he knew what was happening in his absence.
What's been happening in his absence, Anna?
The dogs, sir.
Thank you, Anna.
I'll look into that.
It's good of you to keep such a close eye on things.
Mr. Lester has returned.
- My husband?
- No, ma'am.
- Where is he?
- He's gone up to the fields.
He said not to expect him till dinner.
Katherine.
Welcome home, sir.
- Have you kept well?
- I have.
Thank you, sir.
You haven't been running the house in my absence.
I have.
That wasn't a question.
- Where's your husband?
- Wherever you put him.
I'm so sorry.
- You've heard nothing from him?
- Not a word.
Get a bottle of the Fleurie.
- He wants a Fleurie.
- There's none of that left.
- None of it?
- Not a drop.
She's drank it all.
Excuse me, sir, but there's none of the Fleurie left.
That's impossible.
Look again.
I'm afraid there's none left, sir.
Cook said it had all gone.
And how exactly has it all gone?
I don't know, sir.
- You don't know?
- No, sir.
And the cook, does she not know?
No, sir.
Do you not think it necessary to keep an account of what happens to my property in this household?
All my property.
- Am I to assume you drank it?
- No, sir.
And yet you can offer no other explanation.
No, sir.
Get down.
- Sir?
- On your hands and knees.
You behave like an animal, and I'll treat you like an animal.
Now, get out.
Lock him up.
Sebastian?
I have no desire to see you, until I've had time to consider what to do with you.
Let him out.
- You are entirely without shame.
- I have nothing to be ashamed of.
Nothing to be ashamed of?
Do you have any idea of the damage that you're capable of bringing upon this family?
You have failed miserably in all of your marital duties, more specifically, to provide your husband with a legitimate heir.
Where is your son?
Where is he?
He has made that impossible.
Let him out.
You've had enough time to contemplate, I hope, and to take the opportunity to meditate upon your duties as a wife, Katherine, in this household above anything else.
Give me the key or let him out.
Leave it!
I cannot bear to look at you.
Sit.
Sit.
Eat.
- I'm not...
- Eat with me.
I hate to eat alone.
Tell me about your family, Anna.
Tell me about your home.
I haven't been home in a very long time.
I'm not sure I know what home is.
Do you have any brothers?
Anna?
Do you have any brothers?
How many sisters do you have?
He's...
We should...
What are the names of your sisters?
Sit back down, Anna.
- No, he needs...
- Sit down!
Run to the village for a doctor.
Quick, go.
'He'll not return for the funeral.
He said as much.'
We won't have long.
He won't come back.
He hated his father.
He hates me.
Perhaps he just won't come back.
There.
Very fine indeed.
Man of the house.
Anna?
Anna!
Anna, when you are spoken to, you are to respond.
I'm going to ask one of the maids, um... that young girl, to prepare and bring me breakfast and all my meals from now on.
Just as a precaution.
It could be the mushrooms or his heart.
Nobody's blaming you so don't be so hard on yourself.
You're careful.
He was old and he had a weak stomach.
You heard what Dr. Burdon said.
The master will be home before long and this will all be done with.
Anna, I wish that you would speak again.
Promise you'll try.
She won't speak.
She's mute.
- What if it comes back?
- It won't.
Do you love me?
Of course.
Do you adore me?
Of course.
Could you do without me?
Could you do without me?
It's husbands and wives that kiss like that.
Did you husband kiss you, Katherine?
She won't speak.
You know I shan't be parted from you alive, Sebastian?
"Through hell and high water I will follow you,
"to the cross, to the prison, to the grave, to the sky."
I'd rather stop you breathing than have you doubt how I feel.
Sebastian.
He's come home.
- What time is it?
- My husband has returned.
What shall we do?
Sebastian?
Can you just shut up?
- You look like a little boy.
- Just shut up for one second.
Let me think.
- Go out there.
- Go out there?
Why?
Am I to pretend to be your lady-in-fucking-waiting?
Just go out there.
You're home.
You're awake.
I heard the horse.
I walked it down the lane.
I'm surprised you heard.
I've been sleeping lightly, ever since your father died.
We had to have his funeral in your absence.
Couldn't let him rot in a corner, could you?
I shall place my feet on his grave in the morning.
Do you have the bed made up for two every night?
Ever since your letter came I had no indication of when you'd return.
And thank goodness I did.
You must be tired.
No.
I found it in the fields.
And decided to keep it?
- Holds my skirts up.
- Are you skirts in danger of falling down?
No, sir.
You've grown fatter.
The cook has made an effort to find food to my taste perhaps.
Your face is fatter.
You're altogether larger than when I left.
Perhaps you'd like some tea.
So... you have become a whore in my absence, Katherine.
You think me to be stupid, perhaps.
But perhaps you had no idea that your whoring had been noticed.
You seem surprised.
And surprised that the news of you opening your legs and your cunt for any worthless dog should have reached my ears, but then you opened your legs so very wide, Katherine.
And you've acted so very shamelessly and so very stupidly.
And you've begun to smell, Katherine.
You've gotten so fat and foul-smelling, it was inevitable that the whole county would hear of your behaviour.
My father... bought you,
along with a piece of land not fit enough for a cow to graze upon.
I do not like being talked about, madam.
I do not like being laughed at.
I do not like owning a whore.
You will alter your behaviour, madam.
And how will I alter my behaviour, sir?
You will never see that man again.
He will be sent from this house and you will remain here, indoors with your prayer book.
I can't sleep.
Try.
I've tried.
Can you sleep?
- I'll sit up until you can.
- I can't.
Every time I close my eyes, I see his face.
Can you just get off me?
How can you, just like it was before?
It's making me sick.
I feel sick, constantly.
It won't end unless you let it.
Have you let it?
For you, and for me.
Sebastian, he was going to kill you.
He was weak.
We did it so that we could be together here.
No more bowing and not being who you deserve to be.
- You did it for us?
- We did it.
- I'm sorry.
I'm not sure I understand.
- Teddy was your husband's ward.
- Who's Teddy?
- This is Teddy.
- I'm sorry.
You're repeating yourself.
- It's a shock.
- I understand.
- My husband had no ward.
Mr. Lester knew my daughter very well some time ago and was fond of her.
He fathered a child by her.
- I beg your pardon?
- After my daughter's death... he did the honourable thing and made Teddy his ward.
He has been with us lately.
At Amble, near the colliery.
I'm afraid this is impossible.
He was careful to draw up papers.
I'm sorry for the shock.
You needn't apologise for an impossibility.
Sorry you've had a wasted journey.
Given Mr. Lester's recent demise...
My husband is not deceased.
- He is assumed so.
- He is missing.
But presumed dead.
He is missing and apparently you saw him so soon.
We did.
Perhaps you can advise me as to what has become of him.
He seemed very well.
And certain he was to come here next.
He said it was a matter of urgency.
We can't imagine what has happened to him.
I'm terribly anxious.
I'm sure.
There are papers, Mrs. Lester.
I am sorry.
Perhaps we might have tea.
What is it?
He says you're the prettiest lady he has ever seen.
- She's lying.
- She has papers.
She's forged them, then.
You don't think that every man and woman in the county with half a brain and an empty pocket isn't coming up with a similar scheme?
- She has legitimate papers.
- I thought you said he couldn't fuck you.
He couldn't.
Or wouldn't.
Katherine?
What?
Sorry, er...
I wasn't...
- You were saying?
- I was saying it might be best if Teddy took your room.
Then he's next to my room, and it's larger.
You don't need all that space.
- No.
- No?
No, no, I...
No, I don't need all that space.
After Christmas, then.
Yes.
And perhaps I'll take your room.
You'll be used to smaller spaces from your days in your tiny house, Agnes.
Katherine!
Can I come?
What are those ones?
Swallows.
Look, watch them glide.
Aren't they beautiful?
I think you're beautiful.
- How do you know that?
- What?
Names of birds.
My mother taught me.
She'd take us on long walks and teach us the names of birds and trees.
- Outside things?
- Yes.
Do you miss your mother?
Yes.
Do you?
Yes.
You don't mind if I... if I join you, do you?
I just want to walk a little with you, Anna.
I won't scare you.
Promise.
Get off me.
I need to talk to you.
Go back to your house and your little master.
Please come inside.
I can't...
If I come inside, then we're found out.
And if we're found out, then I'll hang.
While that boy's here, I'm out here.
That's the end of it.
Get out!
Sebastian!
Katherine, watch me.
- Watch me.
- Not now, Teddy.
- Please, please!
- Get off!
Leave me alone!
Sebastian!
Sebastian.
Sebastian?
Sebastian?
Ma'am.
- What is it?
- I'm sorry, ma'am, but it's the boy.
We can't find him anywhere.
- Teddy?
- Teddy?
Teddy?
Teddy?
- Teddy?
- Teddy?
Teddy?
Teddy?
- Teddy!
- He was at the waterfall.
He's freezing.
- Get some blankets.
- Who are you?
How dare you walk into this house and give orders?
Get out.
- I saved him.
- Get out!
Teddy, Teddy.
I will not stay here and be humiliated for the sake of that boy.
- Sebastian...
- I will not!
Tell me what to do.
I will do anything.
- It's too late.
- What?
What do you mean?
I stood in front of him, Katherine.
At that waterfall, that... perfect drop.
One step behind him.
And I...
It's too late.
It doesn't have to be.
It doesn't have to be if you trust me.
You should go to bed.
I can't.
One of us should get some sleep.
I wouldn't sleep.
Lie down for a while.
I'll sit up with him.
You need some rest and he'll need you when he wakes up.
- Just for an hour or so.
- If you like.
Thank you.
- Katherine.
- Shh, Teddy.
Sleep.
- What are you doing?
- Shh.
- Let me go.
Katherine.
- Shh.
It is done.
Sebastian.
No, no, no.
Go wait until I come.
Go.
I must've fallen asleep for ten minutes, perhaps.
When I woke, he wasn't breathing.
Can you remember what time that was, Mrs. Lester?

There's been an explosion, at the colliery at Amble.

He said not to expect him till dinner.
Katherine.
Welcome home, sir.
- Have you kept well?
- I have.
Thank you, sir.
You haven't been running the house in my absence.
I have.
That wasn't a question.
- Where's your husband?
- Wherever you put him.
I'm so sorry.
- You've heard nothing from him?
- Not a word.
Get a bottle of the Fleurie.
- He wants a Fleurie.
- There's none of that left.
- None of it?
- Not a drop.
She's drank it all.
Excuse me, sir, but there's none of the Fleurie left.
That's impossible.
Look again.
I'm afraid there's none left, sir.
Cook said it had all gone.
And how exactly has it all gone?
I don't know, sir.
- You don't know?
- No, sir.
And the cook, does she not know?
No, sir.
Do you not think it necessary to keep an account of what happens to my property in this household?
All my property.
- Am I to assume you drank it?
- No, sir.
And yet you can offer no other explanation.
No, sir.
Get down.
- Sir?
- On your hands and knees.
You behave like an animal, and I'll treat you like an animal.
Now, get out.
Lock him up.
Sebastian?
I have no desire to see you, until I've had time to consider what to do with you.
Let him out.
- You are entirely without shame.
- I have nothing to be ashamed of.
Nothing to be ashamed of?
Do you have any idea of the damage that you're capable of bringing upon this family?
You have failed miserably in all of your marital duties, more specifically, to provide your husband with a legitimate heir.
Where is your son?
Where is he?
He has made that impossible.
Let him out.
You've had enough time to contemplate, I hope, and to take the opportunity to meditate upon your duties as a wife, Katherine, in this household above anything else.
Give me the key or let him out.
Leave it!
I cannot bear to look at you.
Sit.
Sit.
Eat.
- I'm not...
- Eat with me.
I hate to eat alone.
Tell me about your family, Anna.
Tell me about your home.
I haven't been home in a very long time.
I'm not sure I know what home is.
Do you have any brothers?
Anna?
Do you have any brothers?
How many sisters do you have?
He's...
We should...
What are the names of your sisters?
Sit back down, Anna.
- No, he needs...
- Sit down!
Run to the village for a doctor.
Quick, go.
Shh, shh.
'He'll not return for the funeral.
He said as much.'
We won't have long.
He won't come back.
He hated his father.
He hates me.
Perhaps he just won't come back.
There.
Very fine indeed.
Man of the house.
Anna?
Anna!
Anna, when you are spoken to, you are to respond.
I'm going to ask one of the maids, um... that young girl, to prepare and bring me breakfast and all my meals from now on.
Just as a precaution.
It could be the mushrooms or his heart.
Nobody's blaming you so don't be so hard on yourself.
You're careful.
He was old and he had a weak stomach.
You heard what Dr Burdon said.
The master will be home before long and this will all be done with.
Anna, I wish that you would speak again.
Promise you'll try.
She won't speak.
She's mute.
- What if it comes back?
- It won't.
Do you love me?
Of course.
Do you adore me?
Of course.
Could you do without me?
Could you do without me?
It's husbands and wives that kiss like that.
Did you husband kiss you, Katherine?
She won't speak.
You know I shan't be parted from you alive, Sebastian?
"Through hell and high water I will follow you,
"to the cross, to the prison, to the grave, to the sky."
I'd rather stop you breathing than have you doubt how I feel.
Sebastian.
He's come home.
- What time is it?
- My husband has returned.
What shall we do?
Sebastian?
Can you just shut up?
- You look like a little boy.
- Just shut up for one second.
Let me think.
- Go out there.
- Go out there?
Why?
Am I to pretend to be your lady-in-fucking-waiting?
Just go out there.
You're home.
You're awake.
I heard the horse.
I walked it down the lane.
I'm surprised you heard.
I've been sleeping lightly, ever since your father died.
We had to have his funeral in your absence.
Couldn't let him rot in a corner, could you?
I shall place my feet on his grave in the morning.
Do you have the bed made up for two every night?
Ever since your letter came I had no indication of when you'd return.
And thank goodness I did.
You must be tired.
No.
I found it in the fields.
And decided to keep it?
- Holds my skirts up.
- Are you skirts in danger of falling down?
No, sir.
You've grown fatter.
The cook has made an effort to find food to my taste perhaps.
Your face is fatter.
You're altogether larger than when I left.
Perhaps you'd like some tea.
So... you have become a whore in my absence, Katherine.
You think me to be stupid, perhaps.
But perhaps you had no idea that your whoring had been noticed.
You seem surprised.
And surprised that the news of you opening your legs and your cunt for any worthless dog should have reached my ears, but then you opened your legs so very wide, Katherine.
And you've acted so very shamelessly and so very stupidly.
And you've begun to smell, Katherine.
You've gotten so fat and foul-smelling, it was inevitable that the whole county would hear of your behaviour.
My father... bought you,
along with a piece of land not fit enough for a cow to graze upon.
I do not like being talked about, madam.
I do not like being laughed at.
I do not like owning a whore.
You will alter your behaviour, madam.
And how will I alter my behaviour, sir?
You will never see that man again.
He will be sent from this house and you will remain here, indoors with your prayer book.
I can't sleep.
Try.
I've tried.
Can you sleep?
- I'll sit up until you can.
- I can't.
Every time I close my eyes, I see his face.
Can you just get off me?
How can you, just like it was before?
It's making me sick.
I feel sick, constantly.
It won't end unless you let it.
Have you let it?
For you, and for me.
Sebastian, he was going to kill you.
He was weak.
We did it so that we could be together here.
No more bowing and not being who you deserve to be.
- You did it for us?
- We did it.
- I'm sorry.
I'm not sure I understand.
- Teddy was your husband's ward.
- Who's Teddy?
- This is Teddy.
- I'm sorry.
You're repeating yourself.
- It's a shock.
- I understand.
- My husband had no ward.
Mr Lester knew my daughter very well some time ago and was fond of her.
He fathered a child by her.
- I beg your pardon?
- After my daughter's death... he did the honourable thing and made Teddy his ward.
He has been with us lately.
At Amble, near the colliery.
I'm afraid this is impossible.
He was careful to draw up papers.
I'm sorry for the shock.
You needn't apologise for an impossibility.
Sorry you've had a wasted journey.
Given Mr Lester's recent demise...
My husband is not deceased.
- He is assumed so.
- He is missing.
But presumed dead.
He is missing and apparently you saw him so soon.
We did.
Perhaps you can advise me as to what has become of him.
He seemed very well.
And certain he was to come here next.
He said it was a matter of urgency.
We can't imagine what has happened to him.
I'm terribly anxious.
I'm sure.
There are papers, Mrs Lester.
I am sorry.
Perhaps we might have tea.
What is it?
He says you're the prettiest lady he has ever seen.
- She's lying.
- She has papers.
She's forged them, then.
You don't think that every man and woman in the county with half a brain and an empty pocket isn't coming up with a similar scheme?
She has legitimate papers.
I thought you said he couldn't fuck you.
He couldn't.
Or wouldn't.
Katherine?
What?
Sorry, er...
I wasn't...
- You were saying?
- I was saying it might be best if Teddy took your room.
Then he's next to my room, and it's larger.
You don't need all that space.
- No.
- No?
No, no, I...
No, I don't need all that space.
After Christmas, then.
Yes.
And perhaps I'll take your room.
You'll be used to smaller spaces from your days in your tiny house, Agnes.
Katherine!
Can I come?
What are those ones?
Swallows.
Look, watch them glide.
Aren't they beautiful?
I think you're beautiful.
How do you know that?
What?
Names of birds.
My mother taught me.
She'd take us on long walks and teach us the names of birds and trees.
- Outside things?
- Yes.
Do you miss your mother?
Yes.
Do you?
Yes.
You don't mind if I...
if I join you, do you?
I just want to walk a little with you, Anna.
I won't scare you.
Promise.
Get off me.
I need to talk to you.
Go back to your house and your little master.
Please come inside.
I can't...
If I come inside, then we're found out.
And if we're found out, then I'll hang.
While that boy's here, I'm out here.
That's the end of it.
Get out!
Sebastian!
Katherine, watch me.
- Watch me.
- Not now, Teddy.
- Please, please!
- Get off!
Leave me alone!
Sebastian!
Sebastian.
Sebastian?
Sebastian?
Ma'am.
- What is it?
- I'm sorry, ma'am, but it's the boy.
We can't find him anywhere.
- Teddy?
- Teddy?
Teddy?
Teddy?
- Teddy?
- Teddy?
Teddy?
Teddy?
- Teddy!
- He was at the waterfall.
He's freezing.
- Get some blankets.
- Who are you?
How dare you walk into this house and give orders?
Get out.
- I saved him.
- Get out!
Teddy, Teddy.
I will not stay here and be humiliated for the sake of that boy.
- Sebastian...
- I will not!
Tell me what to do.
I will do anything.
- It's too late.
- What?
What do you mean?
I stood in front of him, Katherine.
At that waterfall, that... perfect drop.
One step behind him.
And I...
It's too late.
It doesn't have to be.
It doesn't have to be if you trust me.
You should go to bed.
I can't.
One of us should get some sleep.
I wouldn't sleep.
Lie down for a while.
I'll sit up with him.
You need some rest and he'll need you when he wakes up.
- Just for an hour or so.
- If you like.
Thank you.
- Katherine.
- Shh, Teddy.
Sleep.
What are you doing?
- Shh.
Let me go.
Katherine.
- Shh.
It is done.
Sebastian.
No, no, no.
Go wait until I come.
Go.
I must've fallen asleep for ten minutes, perhaps.
When I woke, he wasn't breathing.
Can you remember what time that was, Mrs Lester?
Just before the girl came in.
Er...
I couldn't say exactly.
Five, perhaps.
- I was upset.
- Of course.
I wonder...
What?
Could you have been asleep longer than you thought?
Might someone have taken the opportunity to come in?
- There were bruises...
- From the waterfall.
They weren't there before.
- When I woke, the boy was dead.
- Katherine...
He must've got the bruises from the waterfall.
- Dr Burdon says not.
- Can Dr Burdon swear to it?
- Have we not suffered enough?
- Mrs Lester...
Forgive me.
Mrs Lester, you do realise...
We killed the boy.
I beg your pardon, sir.
Who are you?
She killed him.
She held a pillow over his face and I held his legs.
She killed Alexander Lester.
She killed Boris Lester, poisoned him with mushrooms and let him die.
She... killed that boy.
She killed that boy so that we could be together.
And I thought I loved her.
She suffocated me.
She suffocated me and she hounded me.
And then she never let me be.
She's a disease.
Mrs Lester?
He's lying.
Anna...
He and Anna did it.
- For whatever reason of their own.
- You bitch!
Everyone knows that she picks the mushrooms and he follows her to the woods every morning.
Perhaps they were found out and threatened with separation.
My father-in-law beat him within an inch of his life the day before he died.
And that boy...
That boy was like a child to me.
Anna will say if otherwise.
I did nothing.
Praise to the Lord.
Who o'er all things so wondrously reignite.
Shelters he under his wings.
Yet so gently sustained.
Hast thou not seen.
How thy desires ever have been.
Granted in what he ordainment
Are you cold?
No.
Are you nervous?
No.
Are you comfortable?
Yes.
Yes, sir.
Thank you.
- You're not cold?
- No.
- This house gets very cold.
- I'm thick-skinned.
You'll find that there can be a fraught.
Won't be like what you're used to.
You ought to keep to the house.
But I don't mind the fresh air.
You'll be more comfortable in the house.
I like the fresh air.
- I like being outside...
- Take it off.
Your nightdress, take it off.
So you'll not go to London, then?
What?
My son will stay here with his wife and play master or something.
Excuse me.
Good night.
You're very tired lately, Katherine.
You will wait up for your husband.
I am perhaps a little overtired, sir.
You will wait up, Katherine.
I will try, sir.
Sit with Mrs Lester, see that she doesn't fall asleep.
I'm awake.
Stop staring, Anna.
- But Mr Lester said...
- I know what Mr Lester said but I'm awake so there's no need to stare at me.
Stand up.
Stand!
Leave.
Stop smiling.
Take your nightdress off.
Face the wall.
Face the wall!
'Where has my husband gone?
'
Away.
- Away?
- That's what I said.
- To do what?
- Nothing for you to concern yourself with.
But I do concern myself.
There's been an explosion, at the colliery at Amble.
An explosion?
- How did that happen?
- Yes, Katherine.
An explosion.
I leave for London this morning.
You'll be on your own for a while.
Perhaps you will find that your energy is restored after a little of your own company, and when your husband returns you can resume your duties with more rigor, madam.
- Just taking a break, ma'am.
- On my husband's time?
We'll get straight back to it.
We're weighing a pig, ma'am.
Weighing a sow, to be precise.
A sow?
As you see.
Take her down.
I said, take her down!
Face the wall.
And stop smiling.
May we turn around yet, ma'am?
How much would I weigh?
Would you like me to check?
Guess.
You have wasted quite enough of my husband's good time and money.
I shall be keeping an eye on you gentlemen.
Anna?
- Ma'am, if I can explain...
- What was his name?
The one that called you a pig, what was his name?
- Sebastian, ma'am.
- Is he new?
Yes, ma'am.
He's the new groomsman.
Is there something else, Anna?
No, ma'am.
My boots, Anna.
- It's still cold out there.
- It's warm enough.
- Mr Lester said that you weren't to...
- Yes?
- It's going to rain today, ma'am.
- Good.
Are you lost?
House is in the other direction.
Mrs Lester!
- Anna, it's too hot.
- Your skin's too cold.
Ow!
It only feels too hot because the cold's got into your bones.
If it feels too hot, then it is too hot.
Anna, you're hurting me.
Anna!
Anna, stop it!
What's wrong with you?
- Sorry, I...
- You've made my skin all red.
- You'll catch a fever, ma'am.
- It's just a bit of fresh air, Anna.
And there's no need for you to stare at me currently, is there?
It's unnerving.
I'm terribly bored, Mrs Lester.
You should dedicate more time to your work.
- Aren't you bored, Katherine?
- You can't call me that.
Get out.
Get out!
What do you want?
No!
No!
Shh, shh.
You must be anticipating the return of your father-in-law, Mrs Lester.
- And your husband.
- I must.
It is not good to be without company for too long.
- The decline in your health...
- My health?
Your absence from church, madam.
No doubt brought on by their absence.
No doubt.
Perhaps a little more time spent indoors, Mrs Lester.
I understand you've been taking the air.
Perhaps a little more solitude and reflection will do.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
It's early for you, Anna.
I said, it's early for you, Anna.
And for you, sir.
Ah, she speaks!
Not so.
Got to give dogs a run-around.
A bitch gets restless if she's tied up too long.
She was, sir.
Was what?
Tied up too long.
Mr Lester wouldn't be happy if he knew what was happening in his absence.
What's been happening in his absence, Anna?
The dogs, sir.
Thank you, Anna.
I'll look into that.
It's good of you to keep such a close eye on things.
Mr Lester has returned.
- My husband?
- No, ma'am.
- Where is he?
- He's gone up to the fields.
He said not to expect him till dinner.
Katherine.
Welcome home, sir.
- Have you kept well?
- I have.
Thank you, sir.
You haven't been running the house in my absence.
I have.
That wasn't a question.
- Where's your husband?
- Wherever you put him.
I'm so sorry.

No, sir.

All my property.

I haven't been home in a very long time.
I'm not sure I know what home is.

Sebastian!
Katherine, watch me.
- Watch me.
- Not now, Teddy.
- Please, please!
- Get off!
Leave me alone!
Sebastian!
Sebastian.
Sebastian?
Sebastian?
Ma'am.
- What is it?
- I'm sorry, ma'am, but it's the boy.
We can't find him anywhere.
- Teddy?
- Teddy?
Teddy?
Teddy?
- Teddy?
- Teddy?
Teddy?
Teddy?
- Teddy!
- He was at the waterfall.
He's freezing.
- Get some blankets.
- Who are you?
How dare you walk into this house and give orders?
Get out.
- I saved him.
- Get out!
Teddy, Teddy.
I will not stay here and be humiliated for the sake of that boy.
- Sebastian...
- I will not!
Tell me what to do.
I will do anything.
- It's too late.
- What?
What do you mean?
I stood in front of him, Katherine.
At that waterfall, that... perfect drop.
One step behind him.
And I...
It's too late.
It doesn't have to be.
It doesn't have to be if you trust me.
You should go to bed.
I can't.
One of us should get some sleep.
I wouldn't sleep.
Lie down for a while.
I'll sit up with him.
You need some rest and he'll need you when he wakes up.
- Just for an hour or so.
- If you like.
Thank you.
- Katherine.
- Shh, Teddy.
Sleep.
- What are you doing?
- Shh.
- Let me go.
Katherine.
- Shh.
It is done.
Sebastian.
No, no, no.
Go wait until I come.
Go.
I must've fallen asleep for ten minutes, perhaps.
When I woke, he wasn't breathing.
Can you remember what time that was, Mrs Lester?
Just before the girl came in.
Er...
I couldn't say exactly.
Five, perhaps.
- I was upset.
- Of course.
I wonder...
What?
Could you have been asleep longer than you thought?
Might someone have taken the opportunity to come in?
- There were bruises...
- From the waterfall.
They weren't there before.
- When I woke, the boy was dead.
- Katherine...
He must've got the bruises from the waterfall.
- Dr Burden says not.
- Can Dr Burden swear to W?
- Have we not suffered enough?
- Mrs Lester...
Forgive me.
Mrs Lester, you do realise...
We killed the boy.
I beg your pardon, sir.
Who are you?
She killed him.
She held a pillow over his face and I held his legs.
She killed Alexander Lester.
She killed Boris Lester, poisoned him with mushrooms and let him die.
She... killed that boy.
She killed that boy so that we could be together.
And I thought I loved her.
She suffocated me.
She suffocated me and she hounded me.
And then she never let me be.
She's a disease.
Mrs Lester?
He's lying.
Anna...
He and Anna did it.
- For whatever reason of their own.
- You bitch!
Everyone knows that she picks the mushrooms and he follows her to the woods every morning.
Perhaps they were found out and threatened with separation.
My father-in-law beat him within an inch of his life the clay before he died.
And that boy...
That boy was like a child to me.
Anna will say if otherwise.
I did nothing.
Praise to the Lord
Who o'er all things so wondrously reigneth
Shelters he under his wings
Yet so gently sustaineth
Hast thou not seen
How thy desires ever have been
Granted in what he ordaineth
(Humming the hymn)
Are you cold?
No.
Are you nervous?
No.
(Door opening)
(Footsteps)
Are you comfortable?
Yes.
Yes, sir.
Thank you.
- You're not cold?
- No.
- This house gets very cold.
- I'm thick-skinned.
You'll find that there can be a draught.
Won't be like what you're used to.
You ought to keep to the house.
But I don't mind the fresh air.
You'll be more comfortable in the house.
I like the fresh air.
- I like being outside...
- Take it off.
Your nightdress, take it off.
(Wind howling)
(Wincing)
(Wincing)
(Men laughing and chatting)
(Clock chiming)
So you'll not go to London, then?
What?
My son will stay here with his wife and play master or something.
(Laughter)
Excuse me.
Good night.
(Father-in-law) You're very tired lately, Katherine.
You will wait up for your husband.
I am perhaps a little overtired, sir.
You will wait up, Katherine.
I will try, sir.
Sit with Mrs Lester, see that she doesn't fall asleep.
I'm awake.
Stop staring, Anna.
- But Mr Lester said...
- I know what Mr Lester said but I'm awake so there's no need to stare at me.
(Footsteps)
(Door opening)
Stand up.
Stand!
Leave.
Stop smiling.
Take your nightdress off.
Face the wall.
(Unbuttoning his fly)
Face the wall!
(Husband masturbating)
(Moaning)
(sighing)
'Where has my husband gone?
'
Away.
- Away?
- That's what I said.
- To do what?
- Nothing for you to concern yourself with.
But I do concern myself.
There's been an explosion, at the colliery at Amble.
An explosion?
- How did that happen?
- Yes, Katherine.
An explosion.
I leave for London this morning.
You'll be on your own for a while.
Perhaps you will find that your energy is restored after a little of your own company, and when your husband returns you can resume your duties with more rigour, madam.
(Door closing)
(Carriage departing)
(Opens windows)
(Wind blowing)
(Wind howling)
(Clock chiming)
(Footsteps)
(Man shouting)
(Raised voices)
(Shouting and laughing)
(All fall silent)
- Just taking a break, ma'am.
- On my husband's time?
We'll get straight back to it.
(Choked sobbing)
We're weighing a pig, ma'am.
Weighing a sow, to be precise.
A sow?
- As you see.
- (Anna squeals)
Take her down.
I said, take her down!
Face the wall.
And stop smiling.
(Chains rattling)
May we turn around yet, ma'am?
How much would I weigh?
Would you like me to check?
Guess.
You have wasted quite enough of my husband's good time and money.
I shall be keeping an eye on you gentlemen.
Anna?
- Ma'am, if I can explain...
- What was his name?
The one that called you a pig, what was his name?
- Sebastian, ma'am.
- Is he new?
Yes, ma'am.
He's the new groomsman.
Is there something else, Anna?
No, ma'am.
(Sobbing)
My boots, Anna.
- It's still cold out there.
- It's warm enough.
- Mr Lester said that you weren't to...
- Yes?
- It's going to rain today, ma'am.
- Good.
(Dog barking)
Are you lost?
House is in the other direction.
Mrs Lester!
(Thunder rumbling)
- Anna, it's too hot.
- Your skin's too cold.
Ow!
It only feels too hot because the cold's got into your bones.
If it feels too hot, then it is too hot.
Anna, you're hurting me.
Anna!
Anna, stop it!
What's wrong with you?
- Sorry, I...
- You've made my skin all red.
- You'll catch a fever, ma'am.
- It's just a bit of fresh air, Anna.
And there's no need for you to stare at me currently, is there?
It's unnerving.
(Footsteps)
(Knock at door)
I'm terribly bored, Mrs Lester.
You should dedicate more time to your work.
- Aren't you bored, Katherine?
- You can't call me that.
Get out.
Get out!
What do you want?
No!
No!
Shh, shh.
(Door opening)
(Sniggering)
(Laughing)
(Katherine moaning)
You must be anticipating the return of your father-in-law, Mrs Lester.
- And your husband.
- I must.
It is not good to be without company for too long.
- The decline in your health...
- My health?
Your absence from church, madam.
No doubt brought on by their absence.
No doubt.
Perhaps a little more time spent indoors, Mrs Lester.
I understand you've been taking the air.
Perhaps a little more solitude and reflection will do.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
(Dog barking)
It's early for you, Anna.
I said, it's early for you, Anna.
And for you, sir.
Ah, she speaks!
Not so.
Got to give dogs a run-around.
A bitch gets restless if she's tied up too long.
She was, sir.
Was what?
Tied up too long.
Mr Lester wouldn't be happy if he knew what was happening in his absence.
What's been happening in his absence, Anna?
The dogs, sir.
Thank you, Anna.
I'll look into that.
It's good of you to keep such a close eye on things.
(Katherine laughing)
Mr Lester has returned.
- My husband?
- No, ma'am.
- Where is he?
- He's gone up to the fields.
He said not to expect him till dinner.
(Gasping)
(Footsteps)
Katherine.
Welcome home, sir.
- Have you kept well?
- I have.
Thank you, sir.
You haven't been running the house in my absence.
I have.
That wasn't a question.
- Where's your husband?
- Wherever you put him.
(Sniggers)
I'm so sorry.
- You've heard nothing from him?
- Not a word.
Get a bottle of the Fleurie.
- He wants a Fleurie.
- There's none of that left.
- None of it?
- Not a drop.
She's drank it all.
Excuse me, sir, but there's none of the Fleurie left.
That's impossible.
Look again.
I'm afraid there's none left, sir.
Cook said it had all gone.
And how exactly has it all gone?
I don't know, sir.
- You don't know?
- No, sir.
And the cook, does she not know?
No, sir.
Do you not think it necessary to keep an account of what happens to my property in this household?
All my property.
- Am I to assume you drank it?
- No, sir.
And yet you can offer no other explanation.
No, sir.
Get down.
- Sir?
- On your hands and knees.
You behave like an animal, and I'll treat you like an animal.
Now, get out.
(Footsteps)
(Grunting and groaning)
Lock him up.
(Groaning)
Sebastian?
(Rattling)
(Grunts)
I have no desire to see you, until I've had time to consider what to do with you.
Let him out.
- You are entirely without shame.
- I have nothing to be ashamed of.
Nothing to be ashamed of?
Do you have any idea of the damage that you're capable of bringing upon this family?
You have failed miserably in all of your marital duties, more specifically, to provide your husband with a legitimate heir.
Where is your son?
Where is he?
He has made that impossible.
Let him out.
You've had enough time to contemplate, I hope, and to take the opportunity to meditate upon your duties as a wife, Katherine, in this household above anything else.
Give me the key or let him out.
(Glass shattering)
Leave it!
I cannot bear to look at you.
Sit.
Sit.
Eat.
- I'm not...
- Eat with me.
I hate to eat alone.
Tell me about your family, Anna.
Tell me about your home.
I haven't been home in a very long time.
I'm not sure I know what home is.
- Do you have any brothers?
Anna?
- (Mr Lester choking)
Do you have any brothers?
How many sisters do you have?
He's...
We should...
What are the names of your sisters?
Sit back down, Anna.
- No, he needs...
- Sit down!
(Banging on door)
(Muffled cries)
(Banging)
(Rattling)
(Thud, then silence)
Run to the village for a doctor.
Quick, go.
Shh, shh.
(Groans)
(Anna sobbing)
(Katherine) 'He'll not return for the funeral.
He said as much.'
We won't have long.
He won't come back.
He hated his father.
He hates me.
Perhaps he just won't come back.
(Shutter clicking)
There.
Very fine indeed.
Man of the house.
Anna?
Anna!
Anna, when you are spoken to, you are to respond.
I'm going to ask one of the maids, um... that young girl, to prepare and bring me breakfast and all my meals from now on.
Just as a precaution.
It could be the mushrooms or his heart.
Nobody's blaming you so don't be so hard on yourself.
You're careful.
He was old and he had a weak stomach.
You heard what Dr Burdon said.
The master will be home before long and this will all be done with.
Anna, I wish that you would speak again.
Promise you'll try.
(Katherine) She won't speak.
She's mute.
- What if it comes back?
- It won't.
Do you love me?
Of course.
Do you adore me?
Of course.
Could you do without me?
Could you do without me?
It's husbands and wives that kiss like that.
Did you husband kiss you, Katherine?
She won't speak.
You know I shan't be parted from you alive, Sebastian?
"Through hell and high water I will follow you,
"to the cross, to the prison, to the grave, to the sky."
I'd rather stop you breathing than have you doubt how I feel.
(Clip-clop of hooves)
Sebastian.
He's come home.
- What time is it?
- My husband has returned.
What shall we do?
Sebastian?
Can you just shut up?
(Laughing)
- You look like a little boy.
- Just shut up for one second.
Let me think.
- Go out there.
- Go out there?
Why?
Am I to pretend to be your lady-in-fucking-waiting?
Just go out there.
(Footsteps)
You're home.
You're awake.
I heard the horse.
I walked it down the lane.
I'm surprised you heard.
I've been sleeping lightly, ever since your father died.
We had to have his funeral in your absence.
Couldn't let him rot in a corner, could you?
I shall place my feet on his grave in the morning.
Do you have the bed made up for two every night?
Ever since your letter came I had no indication of when you'd return.
And thank goodness I did.
You must be tired.
No.
I found it in the fields.
And decided to keep it?
- Holds my skirts up.
- Are you skirts in danger of falling down?
No, sir.
You've grown fatter.
The cook has made an effort to find food to my taste perhaps.
Your face is fatter.
You're altogether larger than when I left.
Perhaps you'd like some tea.
(Crockery rattling)
So... you have become a whore in my absence, Katherine.
You think me to be stupid, perhaps.
But perhaps you had no idea that your whoring had been noticed.
You seem surprised.
And surprised that the news of you opening your legs and your cunt for any worthless dog should have reached my ears, but then you opened your legs so very wide, Katherine.
And you've acted so very shamelessly and so very stupidly.
And you've begun to smell, Katherine.
You've gotten so fat and foul-smelling, it was inevitable that the whole county would hear of your behaviour.
My father... bought you,
along with a piece of land not fit enough for a cow to graze upon.
I do not like being talked about, madam.
I do not like being laughed at.
I do not like owning a whore.
You will alter your behaviour, madam.
And how will I alter my behaviour, sir?
You will never see that man again.
He will be sent from this house and you will remain here, indoors with your prayer book.
(Screaming)
(Neighing)
(Sobbing)
I can't sleep.
Try.
I've tried.
Can you sleep?
- I'll sit up until you can.
- I can't.
Every time I close my eyes, I see his face.
Can you just get off me?
How can you, just like it was before?
It's making me sick.
I feel sick, constantly.
It won't end unless you let it.
Have you let it?
For you, and for me.
Sebastian, he was going to kill you.
He was weak.
We did it so that we could be together here.
No more bowing and not being who you deserve to be.
- You did it for us?
- We did it.
(Carriage approaching)
- I'm sorry.
I'm not sure I understand.
- Teddy was your husband's ward.
- Who's Teddy?
- This is Teddy.
- I'm sorry.
You're repeating yourself.
- It's a shock.
- I understand.
- My husband had no ward.
Mr Lester knew my daughter very well some time ago and was fond of her.
He fathered a child by her.
- I beg your pardon?
- After my daughter's death... he did the honourable thing and made Teddy his ward.
He has been with us lately.
At Amble, near the colliery.
I'm afraid this is impossible.
He was careful to draw up papers.
I'm sorry for the shock.
You needn't apologise for an impossibility.
Sorry you've had a wasted journey.
Given Mr Lester's recent demise...
My husband is not deceased.
- He is assumed so.
- He is missing.
But presumed dead.
He is missing and apparently you saw him so soon.
We did.
Perhaps you can advise me as to what has become of him.
He seemed very well.
And certain he was to come here next.
He said it was a matter of urgency.
We can't imagine what has happened to him.
I'm terribly anxious.
I'm sure.
There are papers, Mrs Lester.
I am sorry.
Perhaps we might have tea.
What is it?
He says you're the prettiest lady he has ever seen.
- She's lying.
- She has papers.
She's forged them, then.
You don't think that every man and woman in the county with half a brain and an empty pocket isn't coming up with a similar scheme?
She has legitimate papers.
I thought you said he couldn't fuck you.
He couldn't.
Or wouldn't.
Katherine?
What?
Sorry, er...
I wasn't...
- You were saying?
- I was saying it might be best if Teddy took your room.
Then he's next to my room, and it's larger.
You don't need all that space.
- No.
- No?
No, no, I...
No, I don't need all that space.
After Christmas, then.
Yes.
And perhaps I'll take your room.
You'll be used to smaller spaces from your days in your tiny house, Agnes.
(Gasping)
Katherine!
Can I come?
What are those ones?
Swallows.
Look, watch them glide.
Aren't they beautiful?
I think you're beautiful.
How do you know that?
What?
Names of birds.
My mother taught me.
She'd take us on long walks and teach us the names of birds and trees.
- Outside things?
- Yes.
Do you miss your mother?
Yes.
Do you?
Yes.
(Rustling)
You don't mind if I...
if I join you, do you?
I just want to walk a little with you, Anna.
I won't scare you.
Promise.
(Door opening)
Get off me.
I need to talk to you.
Go back to your house and your little master.
Please come inside.
I can't...
If I come inside, then we're found out.
And if we're found out, then I'll hang.
While that boy's here, I'm out here.
That's the end of it.
Get out!
(Teddy laughing)
(Katherine) Sebastian!
Katherine, watch me.
- Watch me.
- Not now, Teddy.
- Please, please!
- Get off!
Leave me alone!
Sebastian!
Sebastian.
(Knock at door)
Sebastian?
Sebastian?
Ma'am.
- What is it?
- I'm sorry, ma'am, but it's the boy.
We can't find him anywhere.
- Teddy?
- Teddy?
Teddy?
Teddy?
- Teddy?
- Teddy?
Teddy?
Teddy?
(Door opening)
(Rapid footsteps)
- Teddy!
- He was at the waterfall.
He's freezing.
- Get some blankets.
- Who are you?
How dare you walk into this house and give orders?
Get out.
- I saved him.
- Get out!
(Teddy coughing)
(Agnes) Teddy, Teddy.
I will not stay here and be humiliated for the sake of that boy.
- Sebastian...
- I will not!
Tell me what to do.
I will do anything.
- It's too late.
- What?
What do you mean?
I stood in front of him, Katherine.
At that waterfall, that... perfect drop.
One step behind him.
And I...
It's too late.
It doesn't have to be.
It doesn't have to be if you trust me.
(Teddy groaning)
(Door opening)
(Teddy coughing)
You should go to bed.
I can't.
One of us should get some sleep.
I wouldn't sleep.
Lie down for a while.
I'll sit up with him.
You need some rest and he'll need you when he wakes up.
- Just for an hour or so.
- If you like.
Thank you.
(Coughing)
- Katherine.
- Shh, Teddy.
Sleep.
What are you doing?
- Shh.
Let me go.
Katherine.
- Shh.
(Muffled cries)
(Muffled cries)
(Teddy falls silent)
It is done.
Sebastian.
No, no, no.
Go wait until I come.
Go.
(Door opening)
(Door closing)

- Dr Burdon says not.
- Can Dr Burdon swear to it?
- Have we not suffered enough?
- Mrs Lester...
Forgive me.
- (Detective) Mrs Lester, you do realise...
- (Door opening)
We killed the boy.
(Detective) I beg your pardon, sir.
Who are you?
(Sebastian) She killed him.
She held a pillow over his face and I held his legs.
She killed Alexander Lester.
She killed Boris Lester, poisoned him with mushrooms and let him die.
She... killed that boy.
She killed that boy so that we could be together.

Are you cold?
No.
Are you nervous?
No.
Are you comfortable?
Yes.
Yes, sir.
Thank you.
- You're not cold?
- No.
- This house gets very cold.
- I'm thick-skinned.
You'll find that there can be a fraught.
Won't be like what you're used to.

My son will stay here with his wife and play master or something.
Excuse me.
Good night.
You're very tired lately, Katherine.
You will wait up for your husband.
I am perhaps a little overtired, sir.
You will wait up, Katherine.
I will try, sir.
Sit with Mrs Lester, see that she doesn't fall asleep.
I'm awake.
Stop staring, Anna.
- But Mr Lester said...
- I know what Mr Lester said but I'm awake so there's no need to stare at me.
Stand up.
Stand!
Leave.
Stop smiling.
Take your nightdress off.
Face the wall.
Face the wall!
'Where has my husband gone?
'
Away.
- Away?
- That's what I said.
- To do what?
- Nothing for you to concern yourself with.
But I do concern myself.
There's been an explosion, at the colliery at Amble.
An explosion?
- How did that happen?
- Yes, Katherine.
An explosion.
I leave for London this morning.
You'll be on your own for a while.
Perhaps you will find that your energy is restored after a little of your own company, and when your husband returns you can resume your duties with more rigor, madam.
- Just taking a break, ma'am.
- On my husband's time?
We'll get straight back to it.
We're weighing a pig, ma'am.
Weighing a sow, to be precise.
A sow?
As you see.
Take her down.

Face the wall.
And stop smiling.
May we turn around yet, ma'am?

Shh, shh.
You must be anticipating the return of your father-in-law, Mrs Lester.

It is not good to be without company for too long.
- The decline in your health...

Your absence from church, madam.
No doubt brought on by their absence.
No doubt.
Perhaps a little more time spent indoors, Mrs Lester.
I understand you've been taking the air.
Perhaps a little more solitude and reflection will do.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
It's early for you, Anna.
I said, it's early for you, Anna.
And for you, sir.
Ah, she speaks!
Not so.
Got to give dogs a run-around.
A bitch gets restless if she's tied up too long.
She was, sir.
Was what?
Tied up too long.
Mr Lester wouldn't be happy if he knew what was happening in his absence.
What's been happening in his absence, Anna?
The dogs, sir.
Thank you, Anna.
I'll look into that.
It's good of you to keep such a close eye on things.
Mr Lester has returned.
- My husband?
- No, ma'am.
- Where is he?
- He's gone up to the fields.
He said not to expect him till dinner.
Katherine.
Welcome home, sir.
- Have you kept well?
- I have.
Thank you, sir.
You haven't been running the house in my absence.
I have.
That wasn't a question.
- Where's your husband?
- Wherever you put him.
I'm so sorry.
- You've heard nothing from him?
- Not a word.
Get a bottle of the Flurried.
- He wants a Flurried.
- There's none of that left.
- None of it?
- Not a drop.
She's drank it all.
Excuse me, sir, but there's none of the Flurried left.
That's impossible.
Look again.
I'm afraid there's none left, sir.
Cook said it had all gone.
And how exactly has it all gone?
I don't know, sir.
- You don't know?
- No, sir.
And the cook, does she not know?
No, sir.
Do you not think it necessary to keep an account of what happens to my property in this household?
All my property.
- Am I to assume you drank it?
- No, sir.
And yet you can offer no other explanation.
No, sir.
Get down.
- Sir?
- On your hands and knees.
You behave like an animal, and I'll treat you like an animal.
Now, get out.
Lock him up.
Sebastian?
I have no desire to see you, until I've had time to consider what to do with you.
Let him out.
- You are entirely without shame.
- I have nothing to be ashamed of.
Nothing to be ashamed of?
Do you have any idea of the damage that you're capable of bringing upon this family?
You have failed miserably in all of your marital duties, more specifically, to provide your husband with a legitimate heir.
Where is your son?
Where is he?
He has made that impossible.
Let him out.
You've had enough time to contemplate, I hope, and to take the opportunity to meditate upon your duties as a wife, Katherine, in this household above anything else.
Give me the key or let him out.
Leave it!
I cannot bear to look at you.
Sit.
Sit.
Eat.
- I'm not...
- Eat with me.
I hate to eat alone.
Tell me about your family, Anna.
Tell me about your home.
I haven't been home in a very long time.
I'm not sure I know what home is.
Do you have any brothers?
Anna?
Do you have any brothers?
How many sisters do you have?
He's...
We should...
What are the names of your sisters?
Sit back down, Anna.
- No, he needs...
- Sit down!
Run to the village for a doctor.
Quick, go.
Shh, shh.
'He'll not return for the funeral.
He said as much.'
We won't have long.
He won't come back.
He hated his father.
He hates me.
Perhaps he just won't come back.
There.
Very fine indeed.
Man of the house.
Anna?
Anna!
Anna, when you are spoken to, you are to respond.
I'm going to ask one of the maids, um... that young girl, to prepare and bring me breakfast and all my meals from now on.
Just as a precaution.
It could be the mushrooms or his heart.
Nobody's blaming you so don't be so hard on yourself.
You're careful.
He was old and he had a weak stomach.
You heard what Dr Burton said.
The master will be home before long and this will all be done with.
Anna, I wish that you would speak again.
Promise you'll try.
She won't speak.
She's mute.
- What if it comes back?
- It won't.
Do you love me?
Of course.
Do you adore me?
Of course.
Could you do without me?
Could you do without me?
It's husbands and wives that kiss like that.
Did you husband kiss you, Katherine?
She won't speak.
You know I shan't be parted from you alive, Sebastian?
"Through hell and high water I will follow you,
"to the cross, to the prison, to the grave, to the sky."
I'd rather stop you breathing than have you doubt how I feel.
Sebastian.
He's come home.
- What time is it?
- My husband has returned.
What shall we do?
Sebastian?
Can you just shut up?
- You look like a little boy.
- Just shut up for one second.
Let me think.
- Go out there.
- Go out there?
Why?
Am I to pretend to be your lady-in-fucking-waiting?
Just go out there.
You're home.
You're awake.
I heard the horse.
I walked it down the lane.
I'm surprised you heard.
I've been sleeping lightly, ever since your father died.
We had to have his funeral in your absence.
Couldn't let him rot in a corner, could you?
I shall place my feet on his grave in the morning.
Do you have the bed made up for two every night?
Ever since your letter came I had no indication of when you'd return.
And thank goodness I did.
You must be tired.
No.
I found it in the fields.
And decided to keep it?
- Holds my skirts up.
- Are you skirts in danger of falling down?
No, sir.
You've grown fatter.
The cook has made an effort to find food to my taste perhaps.
Your face is fatter.
You're altogether larger than when I left.
Perhaps you'd like some tea.
So... you have become a whore in my absence, Katherine.
You think me to be stupid, perhaps.
But perhaps you had no idea that your whoring had been noticed.
You seem surprised.
And surprised that the news of you opening your legs and your cunt for any worthless dog should have reached my ears, but then you opened your legs so very wide, Katherine.
And you've acted so very shamelessly and so very stupidly.
And you've begun to smell, Katherine.
You've gotten so fat and foul-smelling, it was inevitable that the whole county would hear of your behaviour.
My father... bought you,
along with a piece of land not fit enough for a cow to graze upon.
I do not like being talked about, madam.
I do not like being laughed at.
I do not like owning a whore.
You will alter your behaviour, madam.
And how will I alter my behaviour, sir?
You will never see that man again.
He will be sent from this house and you will remain here, indoors with your prayer book.
I can't sleep.
Try.
I've tried.
Can you sleep?
- I'll sit up until you can.
- I can't.
Every time I close my eyes, I see his face.
Can you just get off me?
How can you, just like it was before?
It's making me sick.
I feel sick, constantly.
It won't end unless you let it.
Have you let it?
For you, and for me.
Sebastian, he was going to kill you.
He was weak.
We did it so that we could be together here.
No more bowing and not being who you deserve to be.
- You did it for us?
- We did it.
- I'm sorry.
I'm not sure I understand.
- Teddy was your husband's ward.
- Who's Teddy?
- This is Teddy.
- I'm sorry.
You're repeating yourself.
- It's a shock.
- I understand.
- My husband had no ward.
Mr Lester knew my daughter very well some time ago and was fond of her.
He fathered a child by her.
- I beg your pardon?
- After my daughter's death... he did the honorable thing and made Teddy his ward.
He has been with us lately.
At Amble, near the colliery.
I'm afraid this is impossible.
He was careful to draw up papers.
I'm sorry for the shock.
You needn't apologise for an impossibility.
Sorry you've had a wasted journey.
Given Mr Lester's recent demise...
My husband is not deceased.
- He is assumed so.
- He is missing.
But presumed dead.
He is missing and apparently you saw him so soon.
We did.
Perhaps you can advise me as to what has become of him.
He seemed very well.
And certain he was to come here next.
He said it was a matter of urgency.
We can't imagine what has happened to him.
I'm terribly anxious.
I'm sure.
There are papers, Mrs Lester.
I am sorry.
Perhaps we might have tea.
What is it?
He says you're the prettiest lady he has ever seen.
- She's lying.
- She has papers.
She's forged them, then.
You don't think that every man and woman in the county with half a brain and an empty pocket isn't coming up with a similar scheme?
She has legitimate papers.
I thought you said he couldn't fuck you.
He couldn't.
Or wouldn't.
Katherine?
What?
Sorry, er...
I wasn't...
- You were saying?
- I was saying it might be best if Teddy took your room.
Then he's next to my room, and it's larger.
You don't need all that space.
- No.
- No?
No, no, I...
No, I don't need all that space.
After Christmas, then.
Yes.
And perhaps I'll take your room.
You'll be used to smaller spaces from your days in your tiny house, Agnes.
Katherine!
Can I come?
What are those ones?
Swallows.
Look, watch them glide.
Aren't they beautiful?
I think you're beautiful.
How do you know that?
What?
Names of birds.
My mother taught me.
She'd take us on long walks and teach us the names of birds and trees.
- Outside things?
- Yes.
Do you miss your mother?
Yes.
Do you?
Yes.
You don't mind if I...
if I join you, do you?
I just want to walk a little with you, Anna.
I won't scare you.
Promise.
Get off me.
I need to talk to you.
Go back to your house and your little master.
Please come inside.
I can't...
If I come inside, then we're found out.
And if we're found out, then I'll hang.
While that boy's here, I'm out here.
That's the end of it.
Get out!
Sebastian!
Katherine, watch me.
- Watch me.
- Not now, Teddy.
- Please, please!
- Get off!
Leave me alone!
Sebastian!
Sebastian.
Sebastian?
Sebastian?
Ma'am.
- What is it?
- I'm sorry, ma'am, but it's the boy.
We can't find him anywhere.
- Teddy?
- Teddy?
Teddy?
Teddy?
- Teddy?
- Teddy?
Teddy?
Teddy?
- Teddy!
- He was at the waterfall.
He's freezing.
- Get some blankets.
- Who are you?
How dare you walk into this house and give orders?
Get out.
- I saved him.
- Get out!
Teddy, Teddy.
I will not stay here and be humiliated for the sake of that boy.
- Sebastian...
- I will not!
Tell me what to do.
I will do anything.
- It's too late.
- What?
What do you mean?
I stood in front of him, Katherine.
At that waterfall, that... perfect drop.
One step behind him.
And I...
It's too late.
It doesn't have to be.
It doesn't have to be if you trust me.
You should go to bed.
I can't.
One of us should get some sleep.
I wouldn't sleep.
Lie down for a while.
I'll sit up with him.
You need some rest and he'll need you when he wakes up.
- Just for an hour or so.
- If you like.
Thank you.
- Katherine.
- Shh, Teddy.
Sleep.
What are you doing?
- Shh.
Let me go.
Katherine.
- Shh.
It is done.
Sebastian.
No, no, no.
Go wait until I come.
Go.
I must've fallen asleep for ten minutes, perhaps.
When I woke, he wasn't breathing.
Can you remember what time that was, Mrs Lester?
Just before the girl came in.
Er...
I couldn't say exactly.
Five, perhaps.
- I was upset.
- Of course.
I wonder...
What?
Could you have been asleep longer than you thought?
Might someone have taken the opportunity to come in?
- There were bruises...
- From the waterfall.
They weren't there before.
- When I woke, the boy was dead.
- Katherine...
He must've got the bruises from the waterfall.
- Dr Burden says not.
- Can Dr Burden swear to W?
- Have we not suffered enough?
- Mrs Lester...
Forgive me.
Mrs Lester, you do realise...
We killed the boy.
I beg your pardon, sir.
Who are you?
She killed him.
She held a pillow over his face and I held his legs.
She killed Alexander Lester.
She killed Boris Lester, poisoned him with mushrooms and let him die.
She... killed that boy.
She killed that boy so that we could be together.
And I thought I loved her.
She suffocated me.
She suffocated me and she hounded me.
And then she never let me be.
She's a disease.
Mrs Lester?
He's lying.
Anna...
He and Anna did it.
- For whatever reason of their own.
- You bitch!
Everyone knows that she picks the mushrooms and he follows her to the woods every morning.
Perhaps they were found out and threatened with separation.
My father-in-law beat him within an inch of his life the clay before he died.
And that boy...
That boy was like a child to me.
Anna will say if otherwise.
I did nothing.
Praise to the Lord
Who o'er all things so wondrously reignite
Shelters he under his wings
Yet so gently sustained
Hast thou not seen
How thy desires ever have been
Granted in what he ordainment
(Humming the hymn)
Are you cold?
No.
Are you nervous?
No.
(Door opening)
(Footsteps)
Are you comfortable?
Yes.
Yes, sir.
Thank you.
- You're not cold?
- No.
- This house gets very cold.
- I'm thick-skinned.
You'll find that there can be a fraught.
Won't be like what you're used to.
You ought to keep to the house.
But I don't mind the fresh air.
You'll be more comfortable in the house.
I like the fresh air.
- I like being outside...
- Take it off.
Your nightdress, take it off.
(Wind howling)
(Wincing)
(Wincing)
(Men laughing and chatting)
(Clock chiming)
So you'll not go to London, then?
What?
My son will stay here with his wife and play master or something.
(Laughter)
Excuse me.
Good night.
(Father-in-law) You're very tired lately, Katherine.
You will wait up for your husband.
I am perhaps a little overtired, sir.
You will wait up, Katherine.
I will try, sir.
Sit with Mrs Lester, see that she doesn't fall asleep.
I'm awake.
Stop staring, Anna.
- But Mr Lester said...
- I know what Mr Lester said but I'm awake so there's no need to stare at me.
(Footsteps)
(Door opening)
Stand up.
Stand!
Leave.
Stop smiling.
Take your nightdress off.
Face the wall.
(Unbuttoning his fly)
Face the wall!
(Husband masturbating)
(Moaning)
(Sighting)
'Where has my husband gone?
'
Away.
- Away?
- That's what I said.
- To do what?
- Nothing for you to concern yourself with.
But I do concern myself.
There's been an explosion, at the colliery at Amble.
An explosion?
- How did that happen?
- Yes, Katherine.
An explosion.
I leave for London this morning.
You'll be on your own for a while.
Perhaps you will find that your energy is restored after a little of your own company, and when your husband returns you can resume your duties with more rigor, madam.
(Door closing)
(Carriage departing)
(Opens windows)
(Wind blowing)
(Wind howling)
(Clock chiming)
(Footsteps)
(Man shouting)
(Raised voices)
(Shouting and laughing)
(All fall silent)
- Just taking a break, ma'am.
- On my husband's time?
We'll get straight back to it.
(Choked sobbing)
We're weighing a pig, ma'am.
Weighing a sow, to be precise.
A sow?
- As you see.
- (Anna squeals)
Take her down.
I said, take her down!
Face the wall.
And stop smiling.
(Chains rattling)
May we turn around yet, ma'am?
How much would I weigh?
Would you like me to check?
Guess.
You have wasted quite enough of my husband's good time and money.
I shall be keeping an eye on you gentlemen.
Anna?
- Ma'am, if I can explain...
- What was his name?
The one that called you a pig, what was his name?
- Sebastian, ma'am.
- Is he new?
Yes, ma'am.
He's the new groomsman.
Is there something else, Anna?
No, ma'am.
(Sobbing)
My boots, Anna.
- It's still cold out there.
- It's warm enough.
- Mr Lester said that you weren't to...
- Yes?
- It's going to rain today, ma'am.
- Good.
(Dog barking)
Are you lost?
House is in the other direction.
Mrs Lester!
(Thunder rumbling)
- Anna, it's too hot.
- Your skin's too cold.
Ow!
It only feels too hot because the cold's got into your bones.
If it feels too hot, then it is too hot.
Anna, you're hurting me.
Anna!
Anna, stop it!
What's wrong with you?
- Sorry, I...
- You've made my skin all red.
- You'll catch a fever, ma'am.
- It's just a bit of fresh air, Anna.
And there's no need for you to stare at me currently, is there?
It's unnerving.
(Footsteps)
(Knock at door)
I'm terribly bored, Mrs Lester.
You should dedicate more time to your work.
- Aren't you bored, Katherine?
- You can't call me that.
Get out.
Get out!
What do you want?
No!
No!
Shh, shh.
(Door opening)
(Sniggering)
(Laughing)
(Katherine moaning)
You must be anticipating the return of your father-in-law, Mrs Lester.
- And your husband.
- I must.
It is not good to be without company for too long.
- The decline in your health...
- My health?
Your absence from church, madam.
No doubt brought on by their absence.
No doubt.
Perhaps a little more time spent indoors, Mrs Lester.
I understand you've been taking the air.
Perhaps a little more solitude and reflection will do.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
(Dog barking)
It's early for you, Anna.
I said, it's early for you, Anna.
And for you, sir.
Ah, she speaks!
Not so.
Got to give dogs a run-around.
A bitch gets restless if she's tied up too long.
She was, sir.
Was what?
Tied up too long.
Mr Lester wouldn't be happy if he knew what was happening in his absence.
What's been happening in his absence, Anna?
The dogs, sir.
Thank you, Anna.
I'll look into that.
It's good of you to keep such a close eye on things.
(Katherine laughing)
Mr Lester has returned.
- My husband?
- No, ma'am.
- Where is he?
- He's gone up to the fields.
He said not to expect him till dinner.
(Gasping)
(Footsteps)
Katherine.
Welcome home, sir.
- Have you kept well?
- I have.
Thank you, sir.
You haven't been running the house in my absence.
I have.
That wasn't a question.
- Where's your husband?
- Wherever you put him.
(Sniggers)
I'm so sorry.
- You've heard nothing from him?
- Not a word.
Get a bottle of the Flurried.
- He wants a Flurried.
- There's none of that left.
- None of it?
- Not a drop.
She's drank it all.
Excuse me, sir, but there's none of the Flurried left.
That's impossible.
Look again.
I'm afraid there's none left, sir.
Cook said it had all gone.
And how exactly has it all gone?
I don't know, sir.
- You don't know?
- No, sir.
And the cook, does she not know?
No, sir.
Do you not think it necessary to keep an account of what happens to my property in this household?
All my property.
- Am I to assume you drank it?
- No, sir.
And yet you can offer no other explanation.
No, sir.
Get down.
- Sir?
- On your hands and knees.
You behave like an animal, and I'll treat you like an animal.
Now, get out.
(Footsteps)
(Grunting and groaning)
Lock him up.
(Groaning)
Sebastian?
(Rattling)
(Grunts)
I have no desire to see you, until I've had time to consider what to do with you.
Let him out.
- You are entirely without shame.
- I have nothing to be ashamed of.
Nothing to be ashamed of?
Do you have any idea of the damage that you're capable of bringing upon this family?
You have failed miserably in all of your marital duties, more specifically, to provide your husband with a legitimate heir.
Where is your son?
Where is he?
He has made that impossible.
Let him out.
You've had enough time to contemplate, I hope, and to take the opportunity to meditate upon your duties as a wife, Katherine, in this household above anything else.
Give me the key or let him out.
(Glass shattering)
Leave it!
I cannot bear to look at you.
Sit.
Sit.
Eat.
- I'm not...
- Eat with me.
I hate to eat alone.
Tell me about your family, Anna.
Tell me about your home.
I haven't been home in a very long time.
I'm not sure I know what home is.
- Do you have any brothers?
Anna?
- (Mr Lester choking)
Do you have any brothers?
How many sisters do you have?
He's...
We should...
What are the names of your sisters?
Sit back down, Anna.
- No, he needs...
- Sit down!
(Banging on door)
(Muffled cries)
(Banging)
(Rattling)
(Thud, then silence)
Run to the village for a doctor.
Quick, go.
Shh, shh.
(Groans)
(Anna sobbing)
(Katherine) 'He'll not return for the funeral.
He said as much.'
We won't have long.
He won't come back.
He hated his father.
He hates me.
Perhaps he just won't come back.
(Shutter clicking)
There.
Very fine indeed.
Man of the house.
Anna?
Anna!
Anna, when you are spoken to, you are to respond.
I'm going to ask one of the maids, um... that young girl, to prepare and bring me breakfast and all my meals from now on.
Just as a precaution.

She won't speak.

"Through hell and high water I will follow you,
"to the cross, to the prison, to the grave, to the sky."
I'd rather stop you breathing than have you doubt how I feel.
(Clip-clop of hooves)
Sebastian.
He's come home.
- What time is it?
- My husband has returned.
What shall we do?
Sebastian?
Can you just shut up?
(Laughing)
- You look like a little boy.
- Just shut up for one second.
Let me think.
- Go out there.
- Go out there?
Why?
Am I to pretend to be your lady-in-fucking-waiting?
Just go out there.
(Footsteps)
You're home.
You're awake.
I heard the horse.
I walked it down the lane.
I'm surprised you heard.
I've been sleeping lightly, ever since your father died.

Couldn't let him rot in a corner, could you?

Do you have the bed made up for two every night?
Ever since your letter came I had no indication of when you'd return.
And thank goodness I did.
You must be tired.
No.
I found it in the fields.
And decided to keep it?
- Holds my skirts up.

No, sir.
You've grown fatter.
The cook has made an effort to find food to my taste perhaps.
Your face is fatter.

(Crockery rattling)
So... you have become a whore in my absence, Katherine.
You think me to be stupid, perhaps.
But perhaps you had no idea that your whoring had been noticed.
You seem surprised.
And surprised that the news of you opening your legs and your cunt for any worthless dog should have reached my ears, but then you opened your legs so very wide, Katherine.
And you've acted so very shamelessly and so very stupidly.
And you've begun to smell, Katherine.
You've gotten so fat and foul-smelling, it was inevitable that the whole county would hear of your behaviour.
My father... bought you,
along with a piece of land not fit enough for a cow to graze upon.
I do not like being talked about, madam.
I do not like being laughed at.
I do not like owning a whore.
You will alter your behaviour, madam.
And how will I alter my behaviour, sir?
You will never see that man again.
He will be sent from this house and you will remain here, indoors with your prayer book.
(Screaming)
(Neighing)
(Sobbing)
I can't sleep.
Try.
I've tried.
Can you sleep?
- I'll sit up until you can.
- I can't.
Every time I close my eyes, I see his face.
Can you just get off me?
How can you, just like it was before?
It's making me sick.

Sebastian, he was going to kill you.
He was weak.

No more bowing and not being who you deserve to be.
- You did it for us?
- We did it.
(Carriage approaching)
- I'm sorry.
I'm not sure I understand.
- Teddy was your husband's ward.
- Who's Teddy?
- This is Teddy.
- I'm sorry.
You're repeating yourself.
- It's a shock.

- My husband had no ward.
Mr Lester knew my daughter very well some time ago and was fond of her.
He fathered a child by her.

I'm sorry for the shock.
You needn't apologise for an impossibility.
Sorry you've had a wasted journey.
Given Mr Lester's recent demise...
My husband is not deceased.
- He is assumed so.
- He is missing.
But presumed dead.
He is missing and apparently you saw him so soon.
We did.
Perhaps you can advise me as to what has become of him.
He seemed very well.
And certain he was to come here next.
He said it was a matter of urgency.
We can't imagine what has happened to him.
I'm terribly anxious.
I'm sure.
There are papers, Mrs Lester.
I am sorry.
Perhaps we might have tea.
What is it?
He says you're the prettiest lady he has ever seen.
- She's lying.
- She has papers.
She's forged them, then.
You don't think that every man and woman in the county with half a brain and an empty pocket isn't coming up with a similar scheme?
She has legitimate papers.
I thought you said he couldn't fuck you.
He couldn't.
Or wouldn't.
Katherine?
What?
Sorry, er...
I wasn't...
- You were saying?
- I was saying it might be best if Teddy took your room.
Then he's next to my room, and it's larger.
You don't need all that space.
- No.
- No?
No, no, I...
No, I don't need all that space.
After Christmas, then.
Yes.
And perhaps I'll take your room.
You'll be used to smaller spaces from your days in your tiny house, Agnes.
(Gasping)
Katherine!
Can I come?
What are those ones?
Swallows.
Look, watch them glide.
Aren't they beautiful?
I think you're beautiful.
How do you know that?
What?
Names of birds.
My mother taught me.
She'd take us on long walks and teach us the names of birds and trees.
- Outside things?
- Yes.
Do you miss your mother?
Yes.
Do you?
Yes.
(Rustling)
You don't mind if I...
if I join you, do you?
I just want to walk a little with you, Anna.
I won't scare you.
Promise.
(Door opening)
Get off me.
I need to talk to you.
Go back to your house and your little master.
Please come inside.
I can't...
If I come inside, then we're found out.
And if we're found out, then I'll hang.
While that boy's here, I'm out here.
That's the end of it.
Get out!
(Teddy laughing)
(Katherine) Sebastian!
Katherine, watch me.
- Watch me.
- Not now, Teddy.
- Please, please!
- Get off!
Leave me alone!
Sebastian!
Sebastian.
(Knock at door)
Sebastian?
Sebastian?
Ma'am.
- What is it?
- I'm sorry, ma'am, but it's the boy.
We can't find him anywhere.
- Teddy?
- Teddy?
Teddy?
Teddy?

Teddy?
Teddy?
(Door opening)
(Rapid footsteps)
- Teddy!
- He was at the waterfall.
He's freezing.
- Get some blankets.
- Who are you?
How dare you walk into this house and give orders?
Get out.
- I saved him.
- Get out!
(Teddy coughing)
(Agnes) Teddy, Teddy.
I will not stay here and be humiliated for the sake of that boy.
- Sebastian...
- I will not!
Tell me what to do.
I will do anything.
- It's too late.
- What?
What do you mean?
I stood in front of him, Katherine.
At that waterfall, that... perfect drop.
One step behind him.
And I...
It's too late.
It doesn't have to be.
It doesn't have to be if you trust me.
(Teddy groaning)
(Door opening)
(Teddy coughing)
You should go to bed.
I can't.
One of us should get some sleep.
I wouldn't sleep.
Lie down for a while.
I'll sit up with him.
You need some rest and he'll need you when he wakes up.
- Just for an hour or so.
- If you like.
Thank you.
(Coughing)
- Katherine.
- Shh, Teddy.
Sleep.
What are you doing?
- Shh.
Let me go.
Katherine.
- Shh.
(Muffled cries)

(Teddy falls silent)
It is done.
Sebastian.
No, no, no.
Go wait until I come.
Go.
(Door opening)
(Door closing)
(Sobbing)
(Katherine) I must've fallen asleep for ten minutes, perhaps.
When I woke, he wasn't breathing.
Can you remember what time that was, Mrs Lester?
Just before the girl came in.
Er...
I couldn't say exactly.
Five, perhaps.
- I was upset.
- Of course.
(Agnes crying)
I wonder...
What?
Could you have been asleep longer than you thought?
Might someone have taken the opportunity to come in?
- There were bruises...
- From the waterfall.
They weren't there before.
- When I woke, the boy was dead.
- Katherine...
He must've got the bruises from the waterfall.
- Dr Burden says not.
- Can Dr Burden swear to W?
- Have we not suffered enough?
- Mrs Lester...
Forgive me.
- (Detective) Mrs Lester, you do realise...
- (Door opening)
We killed the boy.
(Detective) I beg your pardon, sir.
Who are you?
(Sebastian) She killed him.
She held a pillow over his face and I held his legs.
She killed Alexander Lester.
She killed Boris Lester, poisoned him with mushrooms and let him die.
She... killed that boy.
She killed that boy so that we could be together.
And I thought I loved her.
She suffocated me.
She suffocated me and she hounded me.
And then she never let me be.
She's a disease.
(Detective) Mrs Lester?
He's lying.
Anna...
He and Anna did it.
- For whatever reason of their own.
- You bitch!
Everyone knows that she picks the mushrooms and he follows her to the woods every morning.
Perhaps they were found out and threatened with separation.
My father-in-law beat him within an inch of his life the clay before he died.
And that boy...
That boy was like a child to me.
Anna will say if otherwise.
I did nothing.
Praise to the Lord
Who o'er all things so wondrously reigneth
Shelters he under his wings
Yet so gently sustaineth
Hast thou not seen
How thy desires ever have been
Granted in what he ordaineth
(HUMMING THE HYMN)
Are you cold?
No.
Are you nervous?
No.
(DOOR OPENING)

Are you comfortable?
Yes.
Yes, sir.
Thank you.
- You're not cold?
- No.
- This house gets very cold.
- I'm thick-skinned.
You'll find that there can be a draught.
Won't be like what you're used to.
You ought to keep to the house.
But I don't mind the fresh air.
You'll be more comfortable in the house.
I like the fresh air.
- I like being outside...
- Take it off.
Your nightdress, take it off.

So you'll not go to London, then?
What?
My son will stay here with his wife and play master or something.
(LAUGHTER)
Excuse me.
Good night.
FATHER-IN-LAW:
You're very tired lately, Katherine.
You will wait up for your husband.
I am perhaps a little overtired, sir.
You will wait up, Katherine.
I will try, sir.
Sit with Mrs. Lester, see that she doesn't fall asleep.
I'm awake.
Stop staring, Anna.
- But Mr. Lester said...
- I know what Mr. Lester said but I'm awake so there's no need to stare at me.
(FOOTSTEPS)

Stand up.
Stand!
Leave.

(SIGHING)
'Where has my husband gone?
'
Away.
- Away?
- That's what I said.
- To do what?
- Nothing for you to concern yourself with.
But I do concern myself.
There's been an explosion, at the colliery at Amble.
An explosion?
- How did that happen?
- Yes, Katherine.
An explosion.
I leave for London this morning.
You'll be on your own for a while.
Perhaps you will find that your energy is restored after a little of your own company, and when your husband returns you can resume your duties with more rigour, madam.

- On my husband's time?
We'll get straight back to it.
(CHOKED SOBBING)
We're weighing a pig, ma'am.
Weighing a sow, to be precise.
A sow?
- As you see.
- (ANNA SQUEALS)
Take her down.
I said, take her down!
Face the wall.
And stop smiling.
(CHAINS RATTLING)
May we turn around yet, ma'am?
How much would I weigh?
Would you like me to check?
Guess.
You have wasted quite enough of my husband's good time and money.
I shall be keeping an eye on you gentlemen.
Anna?
- Ma'am, if I can explain...
- What was his name?
The one that called you a pig, what was his name?
- Sebastian, ma'am.
- Is he new?
Yes, ma'am.
He's the new groomsman.
Is there something else, Anna?
No, ma'am.
(SOBBING)
My boots, Anna.
- It's still cold out there.
- It's warm enough.
- Mr. Lester said that you weren't to...
- Yes?
- It's going to rain today, ma'am.
- Good.
(DOG BARKING)
Are you lost?
House is in the other direction.
Mrs. Lester!
(THUNDER RUMBLING)
- Anna, it's too hot.
- Your skin's too cold.
Ow!
It only feels too hot because the cold's got into your bones.
If it feels too hot, then it is too hot.
Anna, you're hurting me.
Anna!
Anna, stop it!
What's wrong with you?
- Sorry, I...
- You've made my skin all red.
- You'll catch a fever, ma'am.
- It's just a bit of fresh air, Anna.
And there's no need for you to stare at me currently, is there?
It's unnerving.
(FOOTSTEPS)
(KNOCK AT DOOR)
I'm terribly bored, Mrs. Lester.
You should dedicate more time to your work.

No!
No!
Shh, shh.

(KATHERINE MOANING)
You must be anticipating the return of your father-in-law, Mrs. Lester.
- And your husband.
- I must.
It is not good to be without company for too long.
- The decline in your health...
- My health?
Your absence from church, madam.
No doubt brought on by their absence.
No doubt.
Perhaps a little more time spent indoors, Mrs. Lester.
I understand you've been taking the air.
Perhaps a little more solitude and reflection will do.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
(DOG BARKING)
It's early for you, Anna.
I said, it's early for you, Anna.
And for you, sir.
Ah, she speaks!
Not so.
Got to give dogs a run-around.
A bitch gets restless if she's tied up too long.
She was, sir.
Was what?
Tied up too long.
Mr. Lester wouldn't be happy if he knew what was happening in his absence.
What's been happening in his absence, Anna?
The dogs, sir.
Thank you, Anna.
I'll look into that.
It's good of you to keep such a close eye on things.
(KATHERINE LAUGHING)
Mr. Lester has returned.
- My husband?
- No, ma'am.
- Where is he?
- He's gone up to the fields.
He said not to expect him till dinner.
(GASPING)
(FOOTSTEPS)
Katherine.
Welcome home, sir.
- Have you kept well?
- I have.
Thank you, sir.
You haven't been running the house in my absence.
I have.
That wasn't a question.
- Where's your husband?
- Wherever you put him.
(SNIGGERS)
I'm so sorry.
- You've heard nothing from him?
- Not a word.
Get a bottle of the Fleurie.
- He wants a Fleurie.
- There's none of that left.
- None of it?
- Not a drop.
She's drank it all.
Excuse me, sir, but there's none of the Fleurie left.
That's impossible.
Look again.
I'm afraid there's none left, sir.
Cook said it had all gone.
And how exactly has it all gone?
I don't know, sir.
- You don't know?
- No, sir.
And the cook, does she not know?
No, sir.
Do you not think it necessary to keep an account of what happens to my property in this household?
All my property.
- Am I to assume you drank it?
- No, sir.
And yet you can offer no other explanation.
No, sir.
Get down.
- Sir?
- On your hands and knees.
You behave like an animal, and I'll treat you like an animal.
Now, get out.
(FOOTSTEPS)
(GRUNTING AND GROANING)
Lock him up.
(GROANING)
Sebastian?
(RATTLING)
(GRUNTS)
I have no desire to see you, until I've had time to consider what to do with you.
Let him out.
- You are entirely without shame.
- I have nothing to be ashamed of.
Nothing to be ashamed of?
Do you have any idea of the damage that you're capable of bringing upon this family?
You have failed miserably in all of your marital duties, more specifically, to provide your husband with a legitimate heir.
Where is your son?
Where is he?
He has made that impossible.
Let him out.
You've had enough time to contemplate, I hope, and to take the opportunity to meditate upon your duties as a wife, Katherine, in this household above anything else.
Give me the key or let him out.
(GLASS SHATTERING)
Leave it!
I cannot bear to look at you.
Sit.
Sit.
Eat.
- I'm not...
- Eat with me.
I hate to eat alone.
Tell me about your family, Anna.
Tell me about your home.
I haven't been home in a very long time.
I'm not sure I know what home is.
- Do you have any brothers?
Anna?
- (MR. LESTER CHOKING)
Do you have any brothers?
How many sisters do you have?

He said as much.'
We won't have long.
He won't come back.
He hated his father.
He hates me.
Perhaps he just won't come back.
(SHUTTER CLICKING)
There.
Very fine indeed.
Man of the house.
Anna?
Anna!
Anna, when you are spoken to, you are to respond.
I'm going to ask one of the maids, um... that young girl, to prepare and bring me breakfast and all my meals from now on.
Just as a precaution.
It could be the mushrooms or his heart.
Nobody's blaming you so don't be so hard on yourself.
You're careful.
He was old and he had a weak stomach.
You heard what Dr. Burdon said.
The master will be home before long and this will all be done with.
Anna, I wish that you would speak again.
Promise you'll try.
KATHERINE:
She won't speak.
She's mute.
- What if it comes back?
- It won't.
Do you love me?
Of course.
Do you adore me?
Of course.
Could you do without me?
Could you do without me?
It's husbands and wives that kiss like that.
Did you husband kiss you, Katherine?
She won't speak.
You know I shan't be parted from you alive, Sebastian?
"Through hell and high water I will follow you,
"to the cross, to the prison, to the grave, to the sky."
I'd rather stop you breathing than have you doubt how I feel.
(CLIP-CLOP OF HOOVES)
Sebastian.
He's come home.
- What time is it?
- My husband has returned.
What shall we do?
Sebastian?
Can you just shut up?
(LAUGHING)
- You look like a little boy.
- Just shut up for one second.
Let me think.
- Go out there.
- Go out there?
Why?
Am I to pretend to be your lady-in-fucking-waiting?
Just go out there.
(FOOTSTEPS)
You're home.
You're awake.
I heard the horse.
I walked it down the lane.
I'm surprised you heard.
I've been sleeping lightly, ever since your father died.
We had to have his funeral in your absence.
Couldn't let him rot in a corner, could you?
I shall place my feet on his grave in the morning.
Do you have the bed made up for two every night?
Ever since your letter came I had no indication of when you'd return.
And thank goodness I did.
You must be tired.
No.
I found it in the fields.
And decided to keep it?
- Holds my skirts up.
- Are you skirts in danger of falling down?
No, sir.
You've grown fatter.
The cook has made an effort to find food to my taste perhaps.
Your face is fatter.
You're altogether larger than when I left.
Perhaps you'd like some tea.
(CROCKERY RATTLING)
So... you have become a whore in my absence, Katherine.
You think me to be stupid, perhaps.
But perhaps you had no idea that your whoring had been noticed.
You seem surprised.
And surprised that the news of you opening your legs and your cunt for any worthless dog should have reached my ears, but then you opened your legs so very wide, Katherine.
And you've acted so very shamelessly and so very stupidly.
And you've begun to smell, Katherine.
You've gotten so fat and foul-smelling, it was inevitable that the whole county would hear of your behaviour.
My father... bought you,
along with a piece of land not fit enough for a cow to graze upon.
I do not like being talked about, madam.
I do not like being laughed at.
I do not like owning a whore.
You will alter your behaviour, madam.
And how will I alter my behaviour, sir?
You will never see that man again.
He will be sent from this house and you will remain here, indoors with your prayer book.
(SCREAMING)
(NEIGHING)
(SOBBING)
I can't sleep.
Try.
I've tried.
Can you sleep?
- I'll sit up until you can.
- I can't.
Every time I close my eyes, I see his face.
Can you just get off me?
How can you, just like it was before?
It's making me sick.
I feel sick, constantly.
It won't end unless you let it.
Have you let it?
For you, and for me.
Sebastian, he was going to kill you.
He was weak.
We did it so that we could be together here.
No more bowing and not being who you deserve to be.
- You did it for us?
- We did it.
(CARRIAGE APPROACHING)
- I'm sorry.
I'm not sure I understand.
- Teddy was your husband's ward.
- Who's Teddy?
- This is Teddy.
- I'm sorry.
You're repeating yourself.
- It's a shock.
- I understand.
- My husband had no ward.
Mr. Lester knew my daughter very well some time ago and was fond of her.
He fathered a child by her.
- I beg your pardon?
- After my daughter's death... he did the honourable thing and made Teddy his ward.
He has been with us lately.
At Amble, near the colliery.
I'm afraid this is impossible.
He was careful to draw up papers.
I'm sorry for the shock.
You needn't apologise for an impossibility.
Sorry you've had a wasted journey.
Given Mr. Lester's recent demise...
My husband is not deceased.
- He is assumed so.
- He is missing.
But presumed dead.
He is missing and apparently you saw him so soon.
We did.
Perhaps you can advise me as to what has become of him.

Luckily we have water, at least here in the office.
Last time we had a heat wave like this...
Drink some.
You know your dad, when he was a little boy, he stole our cherries?
Well, look, Eliška.
We want to sell you the house, of course.
It's in our interest.
I see that your Tomáš signed the purchase agreement, but...
But now...
How are you going to pay for it?
I have insurance.
Once it's settled, I'll pay it all at once.
Yes, but the right thing would be to wait until it's all settled.
I know, Mr. Mayor, but this is a new beginning for us.
Anetka and I thought that it'd be nice to move here where her dad grew up.
Well, in the village we've helped each other since forever.
And Tomáš...
He even stole our apricots.
Here's my stamp of approval.
THE NOONDAY WITCH
I've registered your address there.
- Thanks.
You didn't have to do that.
- No problem.
Anything for Tomáš.
Though, why did he pick this place for you?
For that money you could've bought a house in the village.
Not far from us, by the cemetery.
- We don't want to live in a cemetery.
- Right.
Who would want to live in a cemetery, right?
- This is where I'll go to school?
- You want to go to school?
- You still have a month's vacation.
- No, not now!
In September.
Then yes.
- Where dad went to school?
- Yup.
- When is dad coming to be with us?
- Soon, don't worry.
I don't like how he's always away.
Dude!
- You're driving like you stole us!
- Sure I'd steal you, you treasure.
We had so much fun with Tomáš!
Though he was always kinda weird.
I've hooked up the lines for you.
Gas and electricity should be on.
- Thanks.
You didn't have to do that.
- No problem.
Anything for Tomáš.
But I gotta tell you, that house isn't a mansion.
If you need anything done, now that you're alone...
If you need help with anything, just tell me.
Where are you going, Anetka?
Are you thirsty?
You thirsty?
- You still have water?
- Yup.
We've had none since last week.
I may come by to take a shower, eh?
I'll do it, after I gulp it down.
Where do you want it?
In the back.
Anetka?
Have you seen her?
Anetka, I've been looking for you everywhere.
I'm sorry.
- What are you doing?
- Cleaning up.
- Why here?
- It's for dad.
When he comes, it'll make him happy.
There was a letter for you.
I hid it so the girl wouldn't find it.
Could you give me a hand?
Sure.
From the authorities I guess.
Thank you, Mr. Poláček.
It's Zdeněk.
Since forever.
We ain't strangers.
Once we settle in, Anetka and I would like to give a party.
I hope you and your wife will come.
Sure.
My wife is busy, but I can stop by anytime.
For coffee or to fix something.
Thank you.
They're waiting for you.
- So see you around.
- Goodbye.
What is it?
- A letter.
- From who?
How come you're not sleeping?
Well?
First night in a new house.
- How do you like it here?
- I do.
And you?
I like it.
Bang, bang, sounded in the room, and little Johnny hid behind the hearth.
Bang, bang, sounded again, this time even louder.
Little Johnny drew aside a curtain and looked behind the door...
- Mom?
- Yes?
- Are we going to have a party?
- We will.
As soon as we settle in a bit.
- Will dad be here for the party?
- I don't know.
- When is he coming?
- Soon.
Will you argue again?
You can't argue at a party.
Parties are fun.
We'll never argue again.
Want to finish the story?
I know what happens.
Sun takes him away but Moon saves him.
Want to sleep in my bed?
Not even tonight?
The first night?
You're a brave girl.
My curious kitty.
You're looking at the pictures without me?
I was just looking for something.
G'night.
I'm here only because it's the first night and dad isn't here.
- So you won't be here alone.
- Okay.
Mom, come outside.
Šimon, those are new shoes.
Wow, stop bringing more stuff, there's no room.
But it's yummy, no doubt.
Thanks.
Anetka and I did our best, I'm happy you like it.
I'm happy you welcomed Anetka and me like this.
We've been here for a couple weeks now, this is a new beginning for us.
We appreciate everything you do for us.
Thank you.
That was nice speech!
Beautiful.
Don't see that very often.
Dáša here could learn from you.
The cooking and the speaking.
Dáša!
Eliška, those were really nice words.
We live near the church.
You can't miss it, girl.
I mean... ma'am.
Let's cut the formalities.
I mean we're not neighbors, there ain't any here.
What do you say?
- I'd love to.
Eliška.
- Dáša.
So, come by anytime.
Bring Anetka too, okay?
And now I want to know how you manage all this alone.
Poláčková, being nosy again?
Snooping around, eh?
Careful, Eliška.
When she grips on something, she doesn't let go.
Watch it!
Careful, Mayor, so your wife doesn't see it.
- You have a wife?
- Yes.
- Why didn't she come with you?
- She did.
And where is she?
Don't lie!
What are you doing?
Where are you manners?
She tripped me.
You stay here and don't move!
I'll deal with it at home.
- He said dad won't come back.
- He will, don't worry.
Anežka!
This is Eliška, I've told you about her.
Tomáš' wife, remember?
Tomáš, who stole our cherries.
Then he grew up and moved to the city, where he met Eliška and they have this beautiful little princess.
Come say hello.
You can do it.
I'm Eliška.
I am happy you came, Mrs. Mrázová.
Have you had anything to eat?
Anežka, want something to eat?
Don't you worry, he'll be back.
Well?
How is the house?
Okay?
Yes, but I need some help.
- Tell me.
- Water's not running.
And it won't.
There's a drought.
It hasn't been this bad...
I mean it was.
Once.
A tank truck comes to the square every Tuesday and Thursday.
Okay.
Then there's this.
Don't mean to cut in.
Just wanted to ask if you have the shades.
Excuse me?
Did you make your shades?
If not, I could help you with it.
- He means glasses...
- I can speak for myself.
I mean eclipse viewers...
- Let's go home...
- Wait!
- An eclipse is coming...
- Let's go!
Now when it's starting to be fun, I should go home?
Let's go, you're drunk.
I'm sorry, Eliška.
- You're on first name terms?
Zdeněk.
- We are too, Zdeněk.
- We've been acquainted.
- Let's go.
-Wait!
I'd cut them out of cardboard for you now that you have no husband.
- Come on, let's go.
- I'm coming.
I can stop by any time.
You can count on me.
- Tell her that she can count on me.
- Yes, you can count on him.
- Let's go, you're plastered...
- Don't let that upset you.
You're drunk as a skunk, go home...
Why are you taking the chair?
They think that Tomáš...?
But that means you won't get any insurance benefits.
What then?
Don't know.
- No, I can't!
- Just take it.
It's terrible what's happening to people.
No matter what happened, it's not your fault.
The party cost money, so take it as a donation from the village.
When everything is settled, I'll pay you back, everything.
- I know.
- Thank you.
Well... it's time to go.
- Have you seen Anežka?
- No.
That's normal, she's probably home by now.
- Good night, Eliška.
- Good night.
We're glad to have you here.
Bang, bang, sounded again, this time even louder.
Little Johnny drew aside a curtain and looked behind the door.
- And there, to his surprise, stood...
- Mom?
-Yes?
- Why didn't dad come?
- He's too busy.
- And when is he coming?
- Don't know.
- How come?
- I don't know!
Why did that boy say that he won't come back?
I don't know that either.
And you shouldn't beat up local boys.
- Nobody will like you then.
- He shouldn't tell lies.
- So listen.
- You don't need to finish it.
I know what happens.
Sun takes him, but Moon saves him.
And you are my curious kitty and don't want to sleep in my bed.
- So good night.
- G'night.
Jeez, what are you doing here?
Don't be scared.
I waited for you and fell asleep.
- Your husband was looking for you.
- I'll find myself.
Should I go get him?
- I really need to talk to you.
- About what?
- She'll come back.
- What?
- She'll come back and take.
- Who?
That solitude and heat, that's her.
She comes and takes.
- Who comes and takes?
- She takes a child, won't return it.
Please leave.
- No, listen to me.
- Leave me alone!
"Give that child here," she'll say and then you'll be like me.
Forever.
Enough!
Don't worry, little girl.
- You'll find each other.
- Out!
Go!
Don't worry.
Nobody will come, nobody will take you away from me.
I wouldn't give you to anyone in the whole world.
You're my everything, Kitty.
Together we can do it.
You and I.
And dad.
Mom, I don't want to stay here.
Why can't I go with you?
Because you just can't, dear.
I'll be back in the evening, and we'll make dinner together, okay?
- Mom, I want to go with you.
- You can't, Aneta!
You hear me?
It's just for a few hours.
I'll be back soon.
Wait here.
Be a good girl and don't go anywhere.
Not to the fence, not behind it, not in the field.
Especially not the field, you hear me?
I have to go.
Mr. Poláček will be here soon.
Your mom's gone?
I see.
Maybe you can draw something.
And I'll take a nap.
Maybe.
Hey, come here!
Come, I'll show you something.
You'll see I didn't lie.
- I can't.
- It's close, just across the field.
Come on.
- What is it?
- Shhh!
Run!
Aneta, eat.
You don't want it?
You like grits, don't you?
Aneta, eat, damn it!
- I don't want it.
- So you'll go to bed hungry.
- So what?
I don't care.
- Don't talk like that!
- I want to be with dad.
- Go!
Go to bed.
Anetka, come finish it.
Aneta!
I thought you were gone.
- What are you doing here?
- I wanted to talk to you.
About what?
Does your husband know you're here?
- No.
He doesn't believe.
- Believe what?
That she's here.
That she comes back again and again.
She's close, Eliška.
I was alone then.
And the heat, Eliška.
- I have to be with Anetka.
- Cry.
Cry together.
She comes, takes and won't give back.
Goodbye.
There's still time, Eliška.
Aneta?
Aneta, what is it?
Nothing!
Aneta, open up!
- Come out, now!
- I'm not coming out.
- Why not?
- I'm scared here without dad.
Come out!
Aneta!
Ouch!
- Aneta, are you going to bed now?
- Yup.
Want to hear a bedtime story?
Yup.
Once upon a time in a place far, far away, was a kingdom where, in the Eastern Land's vast fields, lived little Johnny.
He didn't have a mommy or daddy...
One day, when the sun beat down even more than usual, little Johnny decided to go further than he often did, to a place he had never been before.
Anetka?
Anetka, I want to tell you something.
Good evening, Eliška.
Good evening.
Is your wife home?
She's sleeping.
Could you please tell her that we don't want her to come visit us?
Could you please tell her that?
Eliška...
Come in.
Please.
It was a year, maybe two, before it happened.
I'd taken a job at the regional office and almost never saw them.
She came back to me after seven years.
They said she wasn't sane.
Supposedly it happens, to hurt like that.
But she talked about some being, who takes and doesn't give back...
A coping mechanism.
She has had the delusion that the person who strangled our Honza was not her, but some kind of creature.
She's unable to bear the responsibility for what she did.
You know we hadn't talked for ages.
She returned to me years later.
Yet I couldn't even look at her.
But not because of what she did to Honza.
Out of guilt.
She was alone in every way.
But it's too late now.
Anetka is really scared after all this.
She won't leave her room.
This is not what I wanted.
We came here to be close to Tomáš, to start all over, but not this.
But I can't just tie her to the bed.
Though... sometimes I would love to...
Between you and me, Eliška, sometimes I wish
God had taken her to His loving home and freed her from her pain.
And Anetka still doesn't know...
Damn it!
Finally you came!
You'd always drop her here when I was at work, but today I have time for the princess.
No, not for me.
I have to run.
I'll be back as soon as I can.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Poláčková.
I mean Dáša.
I wanted to ask if your husband could stop by.
The drain's plugged, blind's broken, if you could send him over.
I'll send him there.
He chases after you anyway.
- That mangy old fool...
- This is the last time.
And Anetka and I will have some fun, right?
Rise and shine!
Lunch is ready.
Eat.
Chicken soup warms your soul.
- Hi.
- Hello.
What would you like to do in the afternoon, Princess?
See, I didn't lie.
Don't you worry, little girl.
Your mom's here, Princess.
To the table, the meat will be ready soon.
What'll you have, Eliška?
- We should go now.
- Oh no, no way!
You think that you can just run away each time?
What about the meat?
It's bad, eh?
Let me get you something for it, it's your nerves.
I have these pills, I take them all the time.
- This is a fucked-up world.
- It's done, ladies!
Done?
It's still white!
Keep grilling!
Can't you see we're talking?
I heard two people died over the hill.
An old man and a baby.
One got sunstroke, the other heatstroke.
It's brutal, this heat.
I finished my beer.
Anybody want some?
The old fool.
He's losing it too.
As long as we have food and drinks, no need to worry, right?
What is it, Princess, you don't like it?
Eat.
Aneta!
When is dad coming back?
What?
When is dad coming back?
Soon.
Eat.
Eat.
"Denied."
"No sign of foul play." "Our deepest condolences, State Insurance."
It's from dad?
- No.
- Who then?
- It's just... the authorities.
- What do they want?
- What is it?
- Nothing.
- What's wrong, Aneta?
- Nothing.
- Where is dad?
- Gone.
- And when is he coming back?
- I don't know.
- When is he coming back?
- Don't know.
I don't know when!
Hello.
Dáša sends some flowers or whatnot.
And the drain needs fixing, Dáša said so.
And something's wrong with the blind.
- Where is the girl?
- There.
So I'll get to work.
It's fixed, that darn thing.
Aneta!
Don't bother.
You won't catch her.
The kids...
You look tired.
Hope you don't get sick.
Wouldn't be a surprise, in this heat.
Come sit down.
Come on.
A drink's the best cure for this.
Always ready.
Since forever.
Want some?
What are we drinking to?
Good, eh?
Then Dáša and I got married.
But it's been ages now.
Because men are...
I don't know about Tomáš, he was always a bit different.
You must know, Eliška.
He was always kinda weird.
Men are different in that way.
It's an urge.
They can't help it, it's in their nature.
It might not seem fair, but life is unfair.
Since forever.
Where have you been?
- Eliška...
- Quiet!
Why do you keep coming here?
We came here to find peace, you hear me?
To live in peace!
And you keep bothering us.
You keep bending her ear.
You're scaring us.
We're terrified of you.
Leave us alone!
- Eliška...
- I don't want to listen to you.
I'm scared of you.
And she's scared of me.
Locks herself in her room.
- I'm protecting her, Eliška...
- You didn't protect your own child.
You know what happened to her?
Her dad killed himself.
You told her?
The pipes must be taken apart...
So I could come...
I'll come back.
You can count on me.
Zdeněk, what's up, dude?
Mr. Mayor, we worried that you wouldn't drink with us.
No, not today.
Have you seen Anežka?
No.
But that's normal, right?
It's late.
Zdeněk, have you seen her?
Have a drink with us.
She'll be found.
I'll go look in the fields.
Dude, what's up?
Where are you going, man?
Jeez!
I came to finish the work.
You're out of your mind.
Go away!
You should be happy I'll do it for you.
- It's midnight, leave!
- I can't come tomorrow.
Done!
- It's done?
- Sure is.
So thank you.
No problem.
But not everything is for free, you see?
I think you should leave.
Mrázová is running loose.
I'll protect you.
Please go away.
Anežka?
Speak only good of the dead.
I haven't seen you for some time, Cutie.
- She was sick.
- Poor girl.
Such a beautiful summer, and you're sick?
Is she okay now?
So stop by sometime, now that she's better.
That natural event is coming up.
Bring your shades with you and meet in our garden.
We'll grill something.
What a tragedy.
Crazy woman.
She kept running around in the fields, heat or not.
How many times have I told her she'd fry, and here it is.
But speak only good of the dead.
Into your hands, O, Lord, we humbly entrust this good woman, gone to her rest, may she share in the joy of your resurrection.
May her sins and failings committed in moments of weakness be forgiven by your merciful love.
We ask this through Christ our Lord.
Amen.
Want to watch the eclipse with me?
I made the shades for us, look.
So come to our house, okay?
I'm sorry.
I apologize.
When I drink too much then I, since forever...
Even with Dáša.
I didn't mean to touch you.
Nothing happened, right?
I know...
Could you please not tell anyone about it?
Please.
Don't tell anyone.
Why didn't you change, Anetka?
You'll fry in this.
Want to go plant flowers with me?
Or whatever it is.
I don't even know.
We have a flower bed.
Come on.
Anetka?
You hear me?
Damn it, come here, Aneta!
Can you come here?
!
I think they're flowers.
Some might be vegetables.
We need the rain to come, or it will all wither.
The Poláčeks have beautiful flowers, eh?
Isn't it nice when we do things together?
Just the two of us.
Together.
Aneta, what are you doing?
!
Go to your room!
Now!
Go!
No way!
Go to your room!
I told you to go to your room!
No!
I don't want to go!
She takes and won't give back...
Mom?
She'll be back...
Moon embarrassed little Johnny, lifted him up into the sky and took him back to the land far far way, all the way to his house.
And they all lived happily ever after.
Good night, Anetka.
Now I'll wash you, Anetka.
And then we'll make breakfast.
We'll make a strudel.
You like strudel, don't you?
And everything will be fine.
It's over now.
Give me your hands.
Together we can do it.
You and I.
- Eliška...
- What do you want?
Open the door, Eliška.
I'm sorry, I can't.
Eliška, for God's sake, what's in the windows?
Go away.
Eliška...
I don't know what's going on, but Anežka... this is how it started.
And you know how it ended.
Eliška...
Goodbye.
Fine.
Listen to me.
If you want to talk to someone, you know where to find me.
I'm worried about you.
Give that child here.
- Give that child here.
- No!
- Mom, let go of me.
- No, I won't let you go.
No!
No!
Let go!
No!
No!
- Anetka!
- Mom, you're scaring me.
Anetka.
I'm sorry.
Forgive me.
I'm sorry, Anetka.
Please forgive me.
Anetka, forgive me.
What are they doing?
Waitress gave them a children's menu and crayons.
They're trying to see who can connect the dots first.
Bear!
Bear on a surfboard!
I knew it.
I sensed it.
TEDDY:
That's no fair.
My crayon broke.
I wasn't expecting to see you here, Felix.
I thought you were avoiding Langford's.
Why?
Because Emily works here and she dumped me?
Yes, the truth is, I have not seen Emily since the breakup, and I have been avoiding Langford's.
I've also been taking the stairs instead of using the elevator, and donning a moustache and beret for trips through the lobby.
That was you?
Damn, I thought I had me a Johnny Depp sighting.
But I knew I was okay coming here today because it's her day off and she just posted a picture of herself at the dog park, which must have been taken earlier because here you are and here are we.
Hi, Felix.
Good, and you?
What?
I was wondering when we were going to run into each other, and now we have, and it feels right.
The right stuff.
We are astronauts of friendship.
I wasn't sure how we would...
You know, sin...
I'm sorry, this is a little awkward.
Awkward?
No, it is goo... d.
Good as gold.
The gold medal of friendship...
- goes to us.
- Oh!
I don't know where to look.
Okay, well, have to get back to work.
You do that.
Work it, girl!
Well, that went better than I thought.
Oh, God, look who's here.
Uch, Rich Eisen.
He always "swings by"
after the ratings come out to tell me he beat me and that he's my daddy.
Madison.
Eisen.
Swing by to gloat about the ratings?
Oh, what are ratings, anyway?
Other than a highly accurate way to determine who your daddy is?
Was the astronaut of friendship thing weird?
No, no, it was good... it was playful.
Say, Oscar, have you heard?
The Broadcasters Charitable Trust has named me Humanitarian of the Year.
They want someone to introduce me at the banquet, and I thought of you.
You really think I would do that after you come down here and insult me in front of my friends?
He'll be there.
I'm sorry, Oscar, but, you know, you and Rich are on the same network, and the execs think it would be "good corporate synergy."
I just got the email.
And with your ratings being where they are, i.e., the crapper, it's probably not a good idea to make the bigwigs mad.
So we'll see you Friday.
He could use a big wig.
You could use a big wig!
Ah, he's gone.
Just like his hair.
You've got no hair!
Man, he always has to get the last word in.
He's such a jerk.
Reminds me of my bully from high school.
I wonder what she's doing now.
I can't believe you got to get up in public and give an award to that fool.
Oh, don't worry, I'll buy a table and we'll all be there to support you, right, guys?
- Of course.
- Sounds fun.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Oh, sorry.
- I thought he was talking to me.
- He was asking you.
- But you could go.
- I don't have to go.
- I could go.
- I mean, I'm happy to.
- Doesn't matter.
- Unless it's weird.
- Up to you.
- It's your call.
Oh, I hope there's a bar.
It's okay, Felix, I don't have to go.
No, no, of course we can both go.
It doesn't have to be weird if we don't want it to be.
Are you sure?
Of course!
This can be the kickoff to the New Super-Cool Laid-Back Friendship part of our relationship.
(both laugh)
- Uh, um...
- Oh, oh...
Yeah, there's a bar.
- Fantastic.
- Oh, thank God.
OSCAR:
Even though I hate having to say nice things about that clown, the speech reads great.
I just got a couple of tweaks.
Hit me.
You see here, when we say,
"Rich Eisen is a good man who does good things"?
Uh-huh.
Could we lose both of the "goods"?
You want it to read, "Rich Eisen is a man who has done things"?
Yeah, that's better.
Two questions:
What time is the banquet tomorrow, and was it just me, or did you get the sense that Emily wants me back?
7:30, and say what now?
It just feel like Emily was sending me signals.
Oh, Felix, I hate to break it to you, but I think you're in denial.
No, I'm not.
Oh, wait, am I?
(gasps):
I am!
Denial, I'm in denial.
Yes!
He's a weird little man.
Okay, I call Eisen "Rich" throughout the speech.
Are we 100% sure he doesn't sometimes go by "Dick"?
Oh, no, not the whiteboard.
Last time, he tried to teach me about Congress.
Thank you, Dani, for helping me understand my current emotional state and showing me a path to recovery.
The five stages of grief were first defined by noted psychiatrist Dr. Elisabeth Kubler-Ross.
That chimp lady?
I am clearly grieving the death of my relationship with Emily.
But the fact that I can make that statement
- _ - shows that I am through the first stage.
So long, denial!
- _
- I am no longer in you.
So all I have to do is get through the next four steps before tomorrow night's banquet, and I will be completely over Emily.
I don't think it works that way.
Maybe for chimps.
But you're a human man.
Oscar, you saw how I was after my divorce.
I was devastated for months because I couldn't let go of my grief.
I can't go through that again.
I've got to fast-forward through the pain.
I get that, but tomorrow is awfully quick.
Oh, I can do it, I can master my emotions, knock through the next four stages in the next... 26 hours and 13 minutes.
Look out, stage two, I am coming for you!
Oh, no, not the whiteboard.
Hey, Oscar, I slipped Eisen a copy of your speech last night.
And?
Ah, he hated it.
What?
All it was was ass-kissing!
Well, that's the problem.
He picked you because you're rivals.
He wants it to be more like a roast.
He wants me to roast him?
Like the sun roasts his balding head?
Yeah, and then he'll come back at you with his own jabs.
Ooh, like how Oscar has a face made for radio?
(laughing)
Or how he smells like the business end of a baby?
(laughing)
Or how he looks like he's trick-or-treating as a hamper.
I don't like how quickly you're coming up with these.
I'm so angry!
I gave her a year of my life and she chewed me up and spit me out!
Why won't the universe let me find love?
Why, why, why, why, why?
This isn't working.
We've been at it for nearly an hour.
Eight minutes.
And yet I'm still angry.
I think I know why.
I think it's because my body knows that this isn't a real fight.
So I'm going to need you to fight me back, okay?
Just give me everything you've got, ready?
I'm not going to fight you, okay?
You don't even know how to defend yourself.
(laughs)
You might be surprised, huh?
Come on, come on, fight me, what?
Or are you chicken?
Hmm?
Who's a chicken?
I bet somebody wanted to be a real boxer, right?
Huh?
Not just a boxing teacher.
And you know what they say:
those who can't do... (yelps)
(weakly):
Anger... stage... complete.
"Rich Eisen is so bald, if you stare into his head, you can see the future."
(laughs): "See the future."
This is going to be the best speech ever.
He may actually cry.
Man, Oscar, you are going after this guy with both barrels.
Well, it's bad enough that he beats me in the ratings.
Now he's getting a humanitarian award?
I mean, people are going to think he's a better person than me, which is crazy, right?
Right?
- Yeah, it's crazy.
Crazy!
- Absolutely.
I know Eisen asked for this, but I still don't get why.
Why would you want to be insulted by your rival at your own event?
Because "He's so dumb, he thinks Steph Curry is something you order at an Indian restaurant."
I'm still workshopping that one.
Hello, daytime drinkers!
Hello, Felix.
Where are the rest of the Village People?
Well, having worked my way through the anger stage,
I am now in bargaining, and as such,
I have made a deal with God that if I am a better person, He will stop the pain.
So I spent the entire morning out on the Expressway picking up garbage, mostly bottles and cans, and what I like to think was a very life-like prosthetic human ear.
Felix, I get the bargaining part, but I think God might have better things to do with His time.
Like finding me a boyfriend.
Or getting me a refill on my beer.
Whoa!
Now if you'll excuse me, I'm off to play cello in the lobby of the Children's Hospital.
I will be performing
Tchaikovsky's Symphony in b minor, but to keep it fun for the kids, I'm doing it in C Major!
You hear that, Big Guy?
OSCAR:
Felix?
Hello, Oscar, my old friend.
You okay there?
You got ice cream melting on the table.
- Who cares?
- (both gasp)
You guys were right, I'm being ridiculous.
What's the point?
Why am I trying to get over Emily?
I never will.
And I'll never find love again.
I will always be alone.
Felix.
I know it seems rough right now, but... (alarm buzzes)
Done with depression.
_
I feel so much better.
I can honestly say I'm at peace with the fact that Emily and I broke up, which means... (laughs)
Acceptance!
Five stages complete!
And...
With an hour to spare before the banquet, which gives me time to tighten up the old pores with an Umbrian clay mask.
Oscar.
I'm worried about Felix.
That was real pain we just saw.
I think he's losing it.
You know who else is losing it?
Eisen.
If "it" was hair.
Write that down.
Hey, big guy, ready for your speech?
As long as Eisen didn't get hair plugs or his momma didn't lose any weight.
I am finally going to get the last word in.
Felix, they sat you and Emily next to each other.
You going to be okay with that?
Oh, absolutely!
I have successfully moved our relationship into "the friend zone."
Oh, good for you.
I didn't think your plan was going to work.
Now I'm sorry I called you "that looney-ass dingbat."
Anyway, I'm just glad you're doing okay.
Oh, thank you...
I think it's going to be a wonderful night.
Oh, there she is!
She looks nice, doesn't she?
Tell me, was one of the five stages nausea?
Hi, everybody.
(all saying hello)
Hi, Felix.
I know that things have been a little bit weird between us, but I'm really glad that we can be here as friends.
Yes!
Friends!
♪ Keep smiling ♪
♪ Keep shining ♪
♪ Knowing you can always count on me ♪
♪ For sure ♪
♪ That's what friends are for!
♪
I am not okay.
(gasping)
I need to talk to you.
So we're pretending you didn't just chug my appletini?
Okay.
I don't think that me being here is good for Felix.
I thought that since we were such good friends
- before we became...
- Don't say, "lovers."
...lovers... that we could just go back to the way things were.
But clearly he's not ready.
Maybe I should just go.
No, I know things are hard, but Felix is really struggling, and he worked really hard to get this far.
So if you bail now, it'll just set him back.
You're right.
Hang in there, okay?
I'm going to need you to pour the next one just right down my throat.
Dani D!
What do you want, Rich Eisen?
Just to say thank you for coming.
By the way, the door's always open if you want to come work for the number-one sports talk radio show.
Not interested.
Oscar might not have as many listeners as you, but those who do listen love him.
I wonder if they'll still feel the same way after tonight.
What you talkin' 'bout, Eisen?
Mmm.
The salad is delicious.
What are these, raisins?
Cranberries.
Oh.
Raisins!
They're red.
Are you hearing this?
What salad is she eating?
You okay, Felix?
Huh?
Oh, yes, I'm fine, I'm just...
I guess maybe in racing through my stages of grief,
I left a couple of drops of anger in the old tank, but...
Now I'm fine.
My tank is empty.
(voice breaking):
I'm an empty shell of a man.
Whoo!
Still a little bit of depression in there, too.
Know what?
I'm fine, I'm going to be just fine.
Dinner and a show.
Good evening.
And thank you for joining us as we honor our Humanitarian of the Year, Rich Eisen.
(applause)
It is now my pleasure to introduce the man who will introduce "the man"... (softly):
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
You can't give your insult speech!
It's a trap!
What do you mean?
!
Eisen made a weird comment to me, so I snuck a look at his speech.
He's not going to insult you, he's going to say glowing things about you!
It's a setup!
He's taking the high road!
He asks you to say mean stuff about him, and then he gets up there and turns the other cheek.
He comes off smelling like a rose to the bosses, while you smell like what you fertilize a rose with.
He's a diabolical genius.
What do I do?
What do I do?
WOMAN:
Ladies and gentlemen, Oscar Madison!
(applause)
I would like to say a few words about Rich Eisen.
Can't say that.
Not that.
(laughs)
Not that.
Rich Eisen... is a man... who does things...
A good man, who does good things.
Maybe it's better if I speak from the heart.
Rich is my friend.
And a better man you will never see.
Oh...
I'm going to need two seconds.
I'll be damned.
Oscar's going to out-high-road that son of a bitch.
Did he make me a better broadcaster?
Sure.
But he also... (cries)
(voice breaking):
...made me a better man.
He inspires me every day...
Wow, I've never seen Oscar so emotional.
What, a man can't express his feelings?
We have hearts, you know, broken and otherwise.
Felix, this is hard for me, too.
If you're not ready to be friends, we don't have to rush into it.
No, no, I'm good.
I just have other friends, and I'm trying to watch one of them speak right now.
And that's why not a day goes by where I don't ask myself, "What would Rich Eisen do?"
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome my hero, my guiding light,
Rich Eisen.
(applause)
(cheering)
You son of a bitch.
You out-high-roaded me.
Damn right.
Hurts to be the loser for once, huh?
Yeah, well, watch this.
Thank you.
But I simply cannot accept this while standing so close to someone whose dedication to the betterment of his fellow man so, so far outstrips mine.
This plaque belongs to Oscar Madison!
(applause)
Well, I just found that so inspirational that, um...
I'm going to donate $1,000 to... whatever charity this is, in the name of Rich Eisen.
A thousand dollars?
I'm going to have to book him on a hundred personal appearances.
Are you finished, sir?
No.
No!
I'm not finished.
I'm tired of other people deciding when I'm finished with something.
- Felix...
- No!
I was enjoying this lobster!
I maybe even loved this lobster!
We belong together, and no one can take it away from me!
Damn, why'd I order the chicken?
And that's why I vow to set up a fund in Oscar Madison's name to end the plight of homelessness once and for all.
(applause and cheering)
Anything?
You win.
I win!
You know...
For the homeless.
Felix?
You want to hand me the lobster?
That's it, nice and slow... (moans)
I don't know what I was thinking.
I'm such a fool.
No, you were just trying to take a shortcut through your pain.
I mean, I wish you could, but it doesn't work that way.
You got your heart broken, it's going to take some time.
You're right.
And listen, I'm sorry.
For what?
I saw you were struggling, but I got so caught up in the Eisen thing that I didn't help you.
So for however long it takes,
I am going to get you through this.
Thank you, Oscar.
Rich Eisen may have won the award tonight, but you are the true humanitarian.
I am a good man.
Who does good things!
Isn't that Eisen's coat and scarf?
Yeah, a scarf!
I mean, he's the worst.
Do you think he'd like to take the rest of my lobster home?
What do you...
Maybe he would.
♪ That's what friends are for ♪
♪ Keep smiling ♪
♪ Keep shining ♪
BOTH: ♪ Knowing you can always count on me... ♪
Hey, thanks again for watching Beaches with me.
No problem... and by the way, at the end there, there was just some... dust in my eye.
Sure.
There's dust in our apartment.
So, Felix, I hesitate to ask, it's totally up to you.
Are you finished with that?
(laughs)
- Yes, yes, I'm sure.
- Oh, thank you.
(Emily laughs)
So what's next, Terms of Endearment?
No.
Next is The Notebook.
Then Terms of Endearment, then Beaches again.
Why do we have to go back to that one?
(crying):
We already know what happens in that one.
What are they doing?
Waitress gave them a children's menu and crayons.
They're trying to see who can connect the dots first.
Bear!
Bear on a surfboard!
I knew it.
I sensed it.
That's no fair.
My crayon broke.
I wasn't expecting to see you here, Felix.
I thought you were avoiding Langford's.
Why?
Because Emily works here and she dumped me?
Yes, the truth is, I have not seen Emily since the breakup, and I have been avoiding Langford's.
I've also been taking the stairs instead of using the elevator, and donning a moustache and beret for trips through the lobby.
That was you?
Damn, I thought I had me a Johnny Depp sighting.
But I knew I was okay coming here today because it's her day off and she just posted a picture of herself at the dog park, which must have been taken earlier because here you are and here are we.
Hi, Felix.
Good, and you?
What?
I was wondering when we were going to run into each other, and now we have, and it feels right.
The right stuff.
We are astronauts of friendship.
I wasn't sure how we would...
You know, sin...
I'm sorry, this is a little awkward.
Awkward?
No, it is goo... d.
Good as gold.
The gold medal of friendship...
- goes to us.
- Oh!
I don't know where to look.
Okay, well, have to get back to work.
You do that.
Work it, girl!
Well, that went better than I thought.
Oh, God, look who's here.
Uch, Rich Eisen.
He always "swings by"
after the ratings come out to tell me he beat me and that he's my daddy.
Madison.
Eisen.
Swing by to gloat about the ratings?
Oh, what are ratings, anyway?
Other than a highly accurate way to determine who your daddy is?
Was the astronaut of friendship thing weird?
No, no, it was good... it was playful.
Say, Oscar, have you heard?
The Broadcasters Charitable Trust has named me Humanitarian of the Year.
They want someone to introduce me at the banquet, and I thought of you.
You really think I would do that after you come down here and insult me in front of my friends?
He'll be there.
I'm sorry, Oscar, but, you know, you and Rich are on the same network, and the execs think it would be "good corporate synergy."
I just got the email.
And with your ratings being where they are, i.e., the crapper, it's probably not a good idea to make the bigwigs mad.
So we'll see you Friday.
He could use a big wig.
You could use a big wig!
Ah, he's gone.
Just like his hair.
You've got no hair!
Man, he always has to get the last word in.
He's such a jerk.
Reminds me of my bully from high school.
I wonder what she's doing now.
I can't believe you got to get up in public and give an award to that fool.
Oh, don't worry, I'll buy a table and we'll all be there to support you, right, guys?
- Of course.
- Sounds fun.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Oh, sorry.
- I thought he was talking to me.
- He was asking you.
- But you could go.
- I don't have to go.
- I could go.
- I mean, I'm happy to.
- Doesn't matter.
- Unless it's weird.
- Up to you.
- It's your call.
Oh, I hope there's a bar.
It's okay, Felix, I don't have to go.
No, no, of course we can both go.
It doesn't have to be weird if we don't want it to be.
Are you sure?
Of course!
This can be the kickoff to the New Super-Cool Laid-Back Friendship part of our relationship.
- Uh, um...
- Oh, oh...
Yeah, there's a bar.
- Fantastic.
- Oh, thank God.
Even though I hate having to say nice things about that clown, the speech reads great.
I just got a couple of tweaks.
Hit me.
You see here, when we say,
"Rich Eisen is a good man who does good things"?
Uh-huh.
Could we lose both of the "goods"?
You want it to read, "Rich Eisen is a man who has done things"?
Yeah, that's better.
Two questions:
What time is the banquet tomorrow, and was it just me, or did you get the sense that Emily wants me back?
7:30, and say what now?
It just feel like Emily was sending me signals.
Oh, Felix, I hate to break it to you, but I think you're in denial.
No, I'm not.
Oh, wait, am I?
I am!
Denial, I'm in denial.
Yes!
He's a weird little man.
Okay, I call Eisen "Rich" throughout the speech.
Are we 100% sure he doesn't sometimes go by "Dick"?
Oh, no, not the whiteboard.
Last time, he tried to teach me about Congress.
Thank you, Dani, for helping me understand my current emotional state and showing me a path to recovery.
The five stages of grief were first defined by noted psychiatrist Dr. Elisabeth Kubler-Ross.
That chimp lady?
I am clearly grieving the death of my relationship with Emily.
But the fact that I can make that statement
- _ - shows that I am through the first stage.
So long, denial!
- _
- I am no longer in you.
So all I have to do is get through the next four steps before tomorrow night's banquet, and I will be completely over Emily.
I don't think it works that way.
Maybe for chimps.
But you're a human man.
Oscar, you saw how I was after my divorce.
I was devastated for months because I couldn't let go of my grief.
I can't go through that again.
I've got to fast-forward through the pain.
I get that, but tomorrow is awfully quick.
Oh, I can do it, I can master my emotions, knock through the next four stages in the next... 26 hours and 13 minutes.
Look out, stage two, I am coming for you!
Oh, no, not the whiteboard.
Hey, Oscar, I slipped Eisen a copy of your speech last night.
And?
Ah, he hated it.
What?
All it was was ass-kissing!
Well, that's the problem.
He picked you because you're rivals.
He wants it to be more like a roast.
He wants me to roast him?
Like the sun roasts his balding head?
Yeah, and then he'll come back at you with his own jabs.
Ooh, like how Oscar has a face made for radio?
Or how he smells like the business end of a baby?
Or how he looks like he's trick-or-treating as a hamper.
I don't like how quickly you're coming up with these.
I'm so angry!
I gave her a year of my life and she chewed me up and spit me out!
Why won't the universe let me find love?
Why, why, why, why, why?
This isn't working.
We've been at it for nearly an hour.
Eight minutes.
And yet I'm still angry.
I think I know why.
I think it's because my body knows that this isn't a real fight.
So I'm going to need you to fight me back, okay?
Just give me everything you've got, ready?
I'm not going to fight you, okay?
You don't even know how to defend yourself.
You might be surprised, huh?
Come on, come on, fight me, what?
Or are you chicken?
Hmm?
Who's a chicken?
I bet somebody wanted to be a real boxer, right?
Huh?
Not just a boxing teacher.
And you know what they say: those who can't do...
Anger... stage... complete.
"Rich Eisen is so bald, if you stare into his head, you can see the future."
"See the future."
This is going to be the best speech ever.
He may actually cry.
Man, Oscar, you are going after this guy with both barrels.
Well, it's bad enough that he beats me in the ratings.
Now he's getting a humanitarian award?
I mean, people are going to think he's a better person than me, which is crazy, right?
Right?
- Yeah, it's crazy.
Crazy!
- Absolutely.
I know Eisen asked for this, but I still don't get why.
Why would you want to be insulted by your rival at your own event?
Because "He's so dumb, he thinks Steph Curry is something you order at an Indian restaurant."
I'm still workshopping that one.
Hello, daytime drinkers!
Hello, Felix.
Where are the rest of the Village People?
Well, having worked my way through the anger stage,
I am now in bargaining, and as such,
I have made a deal with God that if I am a better person, He will stop the pain.
So I spent the entire morning out on the Expressway picking up garbage, mostly bottles and cans, and what I like to think was a very life-like prosthetic human ear.
Felix, I get the bargaining part, but I think God might have better things to do with His time.
Like finding me a boyfriend.
Or getting me a refill on my beer.
Whoa!
Now if you'll excuse me, I'm off to play cello in the lobby of the Children's Hospital.
I will be performing
Tchaikovsky's Symphony in b minor, but to keep it fun for the kids, I'm doing it in C Major!
You hear that, Big Guy?
Felix?
Hello, Oscar, my old friend.
You okay there?
You got ice cream melting on the table.
Who cares?
You guys were right, I'm being ridiculous.
What's the point?
Why am I trying to get over Emily?
I never will.
And I'll never find love again.
I will always be alone.
Felix.
I know it seems rough right now, but...
Done with depression.
_
I feel so much better.
I can honestly say I'm at peace with the fact that Emily and I broke up, which means...
Acceptance!
Five stages complete!
And...
With an hour to spare before the banquet, which gives me time to tighten up the old pores with an Umbrian clay mask.
Oscar.
I'm worried about Felix.
That was real pain we just saw.
I think he's losing it.
You know who else is losing it?
Eisen.
If "it" was hair.
Write that down.
Hey, big guy, ready for your speech?
As long as Eisen didn't get hair plugs or his momma didn't lose any weight.
I am finally going to get the last word in.
Felix, they sat you and Emily next to each other.
You going to be okay with that?
Oh, absolutely!
I have successfully moved our relationship into "the friend zone."
Oh, good for you.
I didn't think your plan was going to work.

Anyway, I'm just glad you're doing okay.
Oh, thank you...
I think it's going to be a wonderful night.
Oh, there she is!
She looks nice, doesn't she?
Tell me, was one of the five stages nausea?
Hi, everybody.
Hi, Felix.
I know that things have been a little bit weird between us, but I'm really glad that we can be here as friends.
Yes!
Friends!
♪ Keep smiling ♪
♪ Keep shining ♪
♪ Knowing you can always count on me ♪
♪ For sure ♪
♪ That's what friends are for!
♪
I am not okay.
I need to talk to you.
So we're pretending you didn't just chug my appletini?
Okay.
I don't think that me being here is good for Felix.
I thought that since we were such good friends
- before we became...
- Don't say, "lovers."
...lovers... that we could just go back to the way things were.
But clearly he's not ready.
Maybe I should just go.
No, I know things are hard, but Felix is really struggling, and he worked really hard to get this far.
So if you bail now, it'll just set him back.
You're right.
Hang in there, okay?
I'm going to need you to pour the next one just right down my throat.
Dani D!
What do you want, Rich Eisen?
Just to say thank you for coming.
By the way, the door's always open if you want to come work for the number-one sports talk radio show.

Ladies and gentlemen, Oscar Madison!
I would like to say a few words about Rich Eisen.
Can't say that.
Not that.
Not that.
Rich Eisen... is a man... who does things...
A good man, who does good things.
Maybe it's better if I speak from the heart.
Rich is my friend.
And a better man you will never see.
Oh...
I'm going to need two seconds.
I'll be damned.
Oscar's going to out-high-road that son of a bitch.
Did he make me a better broadcaster?
Sure.
But he also made me a better man.
He inspires me every day...
Wow, I've never seen Oscar so emotional.
What, a man can't express his feelings?
We have hearts, you know, broken and otherwise.
Felix, this is hard for me, too.
If you're not ready to be friends, we don't have to rush into it.
No, no, I'm good.
I just have other friends, and I'm trying to watch one of them speak right now.
And that's why not a day goes by where I don't ask myself, "What would Rich Eisen do?"
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome my hero, my guiding light,
Rich Eisen.
You son of a bitch.
You out-high-roaded me.
Damn right.
Hurts to be the loser for once, huh?
Yeah, well, watch this.
Thank you.
But I simply cannot accept this while standing so close to someone whose dedication to the betterment of his fellow man so, so far outstrips mine.
This plaque belongs to Oscar Madison!
Well, I just found that so inspirational that, um...
I'm going to donate $1,000 to... whatever charity this is, in the name of Rich Eisen.
A thousand dollars?
I'm going to have to book him on a hundred personal appearances.

No.
No!
I'm not finished.
I'm tired of other people deciding when I'm finished with something.
- Felix...
- No!
I was enjoying this lobster!
I maybe even loved this lobster!
We belong together, and no one can take it away from me!
Damn, why'd I order the chicken?
And that's why I vow to set up a fund in Oscar Madison's name to end the plight of homelessness once and for all.
Anything?
You win.
I win!
You know...
For the homeless.
Felix?
You want to hand me the lobster?
That's it, nice and slow...
I don't know what I was thinking.
I'm such a fool.
No, you were just trying to take a shortcut through your pain.
I mean, I wish you could, but it doesn't work that way.
You got your heart broken, it's going to take some time.
You're right.
And listen, I'm sorry.
For what?
I saw you were struggling, but I got so caught up in the Eisen thing that I didn't help you.
So for however long it takes,
I am going to get you through this.
Thank you, Oscar.
Rich Eisen may have won the award tonight, but you are the true humanitarian.
I am a good man.
Who does good things!
Isn't that Eisen's coat and scarf?
Yeah, a scarf!
I mean, he's the worst.
Do you think he'd like to take the rest of my lobster home?

Sure.

Are you finished with that?
- Yes, yes, I'm sure.

So what's next, Terms of Endearment?
No.
Next is The Notebook.

Why do we have to go back to that one?
We already know what happens in that one.
It's coming!
Get ready!
Go, man, go!
Damn it!
Damn it!
Engine's dead!
Get it.
Kill it!
Shoot anything that moves.
Help.

You need to sacrifice everything if you want to survive.
Hmm.
That's funny.
'Cause I thought I would just...
Mm.
Yeah, that's one way to go.
Want a beer?
It's 6:00 in the morning.
What, are you Hemingway?
No, is that real?
When did we cross the North Pole?
An hour ago.
Oh, my gosh.
It's hard to keep track in this thing.
We shouldn't have to stay on clock when we're moving through time zones.
I mean, what is that ...
three continents in two days?
If you count Berlin.
We were only there three hours.
Yeah, we knew that Inhuman call was a hoax as soon as we stepped foot in the apartment, saw that bong.
- I could smell it from the hallway.
- Jokers.
Hungry for attention.
And potato chips.
If the munchies was a superpower, they'd be signing the Sokovia Accords as we speak.
You should let me work on Lola.
I warned you.
Everything in Lola is custom.
Yeah, yeah, everything is custom.
But it would be something to do.
There's only so many times a guy can win cash off you... sir.
You got to stop calling me that.
- We're being called back to H.Q.
- They say why?
We're not due for a restock for another 10 days.
- No idea.
They said it's classified.
- Oh, everything is nowadays.
All right, we'll need full inventory.
Medical, provisions, fuel cells, and make sure you tell the crew they'll need to call ahead if they want off our next deployment.
Agent Thompson...
- Wonder what that's about.
- Oh, I don't know.
- It'll be good to see Fitz and Simmons.
- And May.
Yeah...
I think you look forward to that more than I do.
Hyah!
What was his mistake?
You know I'm not gonna talk.
He didn't anticipate your back kick.
Opened himself up.
His mistake was he tapped out.
- Piper.
- Okay, people!
What, you never seen the biggest plane ever built before?
!
Next pairing, on the mat!
- How long has it been?
- Six weeks in the air.
Only the Quinjet touched down.
- Is that a record for Zephyr One?
- It is.
It was supposed to be even longer.
- You know who called us in?
- I do.
You?
Okay.
Now I know something's up.
I got word from contacts in law enforcement, Los Angeles.
Two civilians were violently killed.
Mysterious burns, heads bashed in, spine pulled out of his ...
Wow.
Many conflicting accounts, but all agree... it was odd.
Odd?
Isn't that our wheelhouse?
He's right.
Why call us in?
We could be headed to the scene right now to confirm the presence of an enhanced person,
- if there is one.
- If it checks out, we bag and tag.
We handle these on the fly.
Didn't exactly want to send this out on the wire.
May, you're not sharing again.
Now would be a really good time to share.
The police also have another victim in custody.
Critical condition.
Under sedation, he mentioned seeing a girl, saying it was the one from the news.
Quake.
Which you didn't want to send over the wire.
You were pulled off Daisy's case.
The Director thinks she slipped through our fingers too many times.
The Director thinks you let her.
No, we pursued her.
She was a ghost.
Well, in his infinite wisdom, he says you're now forbidden to.
But you're telling us this because... ?
In case we want to do something about it.
Look, I can bury this until the official police report comes through.
That'll buy us a few hours lead time.
Get to L.A., sniff around.
Yeah.
We have an active Inhuman asset in Los Angeles that's due for a check-in soon enough.
It'll justify our presence there, but as soon as the report's filed, they'll pull us out.
And the armed forces will be sent in after her.
With orders to kill.
- To kill?
- If she's responsible for these bodies.
- That's not Daisy's M.O.
- The world knows her as Quake, and Quake is an outlaw who takes down banks and bridges.
- Oh, come on.
We both know
- She's hunting violent radicals.
she's tracking these fanatics, the Watchdogs, trying to take down their funding, their ... their escape routes.
Regardless, you should fuel up and get back up in the air ASAP.
Find her before the military does something bad.
Or Daisy does something worse.
Hey.
You can't be here.
Stop right there.
How are we feeling today?
I've been tracking weapon sales, and I know you were hired to steal one.
You even jacked a big rig to help carry it out.
We were just paid for a smash-and-grab job.
Who was that hunting you?
Open the door!
He nailed me, but we almost got away.
Who was it?
- Did he kill my friends?
- All but one.
But you're gonna have to give me a little bit more if I'm gonna find him alive.
Save him, please, before he gets burned, too.
You'll see your buddy again once you heal up.
- Just tell me what's ...
- No.
No.
It's too late for me.
They say when the Rider burns you he burns your soul.
And a soul can never heal.
Stop right there!
Hello?
Hello?
I hear my voice echo, but it sounds strange in my head.
The detail is amazing.
However, I am 3 feet off the ground.
Wait.
What?
Hold on.
Damn it.
Uh, well, I did adjust the Y axis earlier for some reason.
- What does that look like now?
- Better.
The CPU seems to be handling the high poly count.
Textures are impeccable.
We should build a place to get away ... a meadow or a cottage somewhere.
I wish it were ever this quiet.
Direct-current stimulation.
Creates the other senses like touch and taste but also takes feedback.
So I've just mapped your brain's response ...
Response to the environment.
Of course.
Dr. Radcliffe came up with the architecture?
Yeah.
Yeah, he calls it "The Framework."
But all the transcranial apparatus, that's all me.
No.
Of course, you're brilliant, too.
Of course.
'Cause soon you won't even need the eyewear or the earwear, 'cause it'll all be inside your head.
So May's strike team will be able to train virtually instead of May constantly breaking their ribs.
Hey, hey.
Authorized personnel only, pal.
No pass, no entry.
- Who the hell are you?
- Leave them be, Nathanson.
They have more reason to be here than you do.
Wow.
A lot of new faces.
Good to see yours.
Six weeks.
That's a record.
- Heard you got a promotion.
- Oh, yeah, and a title.
Yeah, Special Advisor to the Director in Science and Technology.
Or "SADIST."
- They keeping you busy?
- With busywork, mostly.
Yeah, and random state-of-the-art lie-detector tests.
So that's the cost of being in the Director's inner circle.
Yeah, he's paranoid about what happened the last time S.H.I.E.L.D. was government-run.
Calls it his Widespread Infiltration Monitoring Program.
Or "WIMP." Hey, uh, you should join us 'cause we're gonna go to Radcliffe's and watch the
Aberdeen-Inverness Caley Thistle League cup final.
They're ...
Those are football teams.
I'm not sure they are, Turbo.
Unfortunately, we have to be wheels-up in 10 minutes, so...
Okay.
All right.
Well, strictly business, then.
Aw, yeah.
New toys?
The exploding pen that you asked for.
I can't imagine a use for it.
You never wanted one?
And for you, Direct... uh, Agent Coulson with new bells and whistles.
And the directions will be there when you boot it up.
What's, uh ...
What's the assignment?
- It's classified.
- Right.
Everything is these days.
- Fitz, sadly, um...
- Yeah, you can't make the match, either.
- I have to finish my reports.
- Yeah, no, I get it.
That's okay.
Just a shame we hardly get to see each other.
- Any of us.
- Yes, well...
At least it's better than the friends we'll never see again.
_
_
We just stole a box.
I don't even know what was inside of it.
We ...
We loaded it onto an 18-wheeler, we parked it in a warehouse, and we just left it.
Left it for who?
The Chinatown Crew.
They set the job up and were willing to pay big.
Lies.
Aryan Brotherhood working with the Chinese?
I swear!
I swear that's all I know.
Where's this warehouse?
I ...
I can't tell you that, man.
My people are gonna be mowed down in the payback ... the ones you didn't already kill.
If you don't tell me, you'll have to tell him.
This guy's missing.
The rest are dead.
Aryan Brotherhood.
They're not my kind of brothers.
They've been know to work for cash.
Burglary, assault ... sort of the value meal of hired guns.
They're suspected in the recent theft of this big rig.
- Probably prepping for a larger score.
- Big, yellow, hard to hide.
So, what, are we looking for this thing?
And if Daisy's chasing the same angle, maybe we get to the finish line first.
I'll greet her when she arrives.
- Agent Coulson?
- Davis.
Preparing for decent.
Inhuman asset will be waiting on the tarmac.
What?
- How's your wife, Davis?
- Getting bigger every day.
- Oh.
Don't tell her that.
- More beautiful every day.
There you go.
Mack.
Yo-Yo.
- Just have a few questions.
- I'm all yours.
Uh, so, I see you went to Colombia for a week.
Mm-hmm.
Mm.
And, uh, tickets to Miami coming up.
Yes.
Do you watch me sleep or shower or... ?
Just procedure.
You don't have to use a satellite to get to know me better.
Just ask me to dinner again.
You know the rules about fraternizing with assets in the field.
Oh, we haven't fraternized anything yet.
And I thought you were breaking the rules, coming to do my checkup early just to see me.
Or are you here because, uh, there's been a lot of little earthquakes lately?
Daisy could be in the area.
But officially, that's not the mission.
Doesn't matter.
We'll never find her.
She's always one step ahead.
What is the official mission?
Can I help?
Here's where I have to remind you that Sokovia Accords,
- which you signed...
- Oh, all right.
... require approval by the United Nations subcommittee...
- before an enhanced indiv...
- Rules, rules, rules.
Blah, blah, blah.
S.H.I.E.L.D. moves too slow now, Turtleman.
- I prefer to move fast.
- Uh...
Mack, they found the truck.
Good to see you, too, Coulson!
Well, if you're in Miami, look me up.
Just because we can't work together doesn't mean we can't live a little.
Hey, just in time.
They've just taken to the pitch.
Where's Jemma?
Is she not coming?
Yeah, she wanted to.
Same story.
All work and no play, huh?
That's a bit disappointing.
Still, make yourself comfortable.
I'm just, uh, finishing cleaning up.
Yeah, should be pretty lopsided, don't you think?
Their keeper's absolutely crap...
Oh, my gosh!
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I had no idea there was somebody here.
Hello.
You ...
You weren't meant to see that.
Hello.
I'm glad to final...
- Hello.
I'm glad to final...
- Fitz, meet Aida.
- Hello.
I'm glad to final...
- She's, uh, crashed.
Hello.
I'm glad to final...
Hello.
I'm glad to final...
Hello.
I'm glad to final...
Hello.
I'm glad to final...
Hello.
I'm glad to final...
Hello.
I'm glad to final...
- What the hell?
- Well, I've just upped her PSU to compensate for image processing.
Must have overcranked it.
I'll reboot.
Unh-unh, that's not what I meant.
I meant...
- ...what the hell?
!
- Well, you've already met Aida, digital personal assistant, as a voice on the computer.
So, uh...
- I built her a body.
- Yeah, a naked body.
I-I was just now installing new hardware, updating her gyroscopic sensors.
I'm not some sicko.
When did you build this?
Have you forgotten the very strict stipulations that came with your pardon?
You are not allowed experimentation
- without approval and oversight!
- Oversight, I know.
I'm well aware of that, yeah.
That's why I wanted Simmons here.
I wanted to show both of you.
Look.
This has been a lifelong dream of mine, Fitz.
When I saw the work you and Simmons were doing in replicating human tissue and internal bone structure in Coulson's hand, I knew ...
I knew right then that this was within reach.
- A robot?
- Not just a robot.
It's one that can cross the uncanny valley and come out the other side ...
pass for a human.
I mean, it has bloody micro-expressions.
She.
It's a ...
It's definitely a "she" 'cause I saw ...
- Yes...
- She has micro-expressions, full range of motion.
I mean, physically, it's ...
- she's nearly perfect.
- She is very realistic.
Now, mentally, well, you've spoken with Aida.
She's bright, she laughs at the jokes
I programmed her to recognize, but she's never pass the Turing test.
At the moment, that's a pipe dream.
However, I think, with your help...
No, no.
No, no, no, no!
We have to report this right away.
- You could lose everything.
- I know.
- Or you could go to jail.
- I know!
I know, you're right.
Full disclosure at this time is the best course of action.
I ...
I agree.
Hmm.
At least let me show you how it works.
They're in town.
I supposed you guessed that, texting me.
They're looking for a truck.
That mean you have something for me?
They watch my every move, but certain moves they can't see.
You can't get these over the counter.
S.H.I.E.L.D. issue for rapid bone healing, yes?
I know you splintered your bones when you first powered up.
- Are you pushing yourself too hard?
- Don't worry about me.
You can't use your powers too much.
- Your body will break down.
- I'm fine.
I'm surprised you're still in town.
You're usually moving and moving.
Are you, uh, still hunting those perros rabiosos?
It's not just the Watchdogs now.
Local gangs have been working for them, which I... don't understand.
I was tracing the sale of a weapon, and I...
I think I may have stumbled upon a serial killer.
Ooh.
Fun.
He live around here?
He mostly hits this area, but he's hard to track down, leaves no traces behind, operates alone.
Sound familiar?
I thought maybe you were, uh, growing roots, they say.
- L.A. used to be where you hang out, no?
- No roots.
Everyone gets attached to something eventually.
Don't forget to wait two stops after I get off.
Yeah, yeah.
Hey.
Send me a picture of this guy.
Maybe I can cover some ground if I know what he looks like.
No, I still haven't gotten a good look at him yet, so just...
take care of yourself, okay?
But thank you for the S.H.I.E.L.D. intel.
They won't give up on you, especially Coulson.
All he wants is to find you.
Well, that's too bad, 'cause there's only one thing I want.
Oh, yeah?
What's that?
Nothing to lose.
Here's the Mapping-Action Eyewear you requested.
Should help your team in case of a blind takedown.
- Great.
Thanks.
- I need you to sign for it.
I don't get the new color-coded security-level rainbow of...
- What's it called?
- The "Spectrum of Security."
Why do I, level red, have to go through you, level orange, to request hardware?
Shouldn't red be higher than orange?
Well, orange encompasses both red and yellow, so...
It's hard to explain, but the Director didn't want to use numbers because he didn't want any team member to feel less than.
Well, you do have a higher clearance than me.
Only in most instances.
I feel less than.
Hey, we just had a report come in.
A death in a hospital in Los Angeles.
Suspicious circumstances.
Suspect is an Asian female.
You think it might be Daisy.
I'm going to look into it.
I just wondered if you'd heard anything from your law-enforcement contacts?
I'm mostly in the dark these days.
Why don't you ask the Director?
Since you're one of the few people allowed or willing to do that.
What you got there?
Didn't hear?
Word is, he hit again last night.
- Two dead in the street.
- Who?
Ghost Rider.
You must not be from around here.
Do you know where I can find him?
Nobody does.
Everybody that sees his face ends up on this wall.
"Everyone gets attached to something."
We got to get this truck out of here.
What are you, the Feds?
Something like that.
We'll be sealing the scene.
Not for long, I hope.
I was just gonna have this guy tow this thing away so me and my crew can get back to work.
We got this.
This warehouse usually sits empty.
We were gonna store some inventory today.
Found the lock broken and this big, honkin' thing inside.
- Have at it.
- Thank you.
Not fair.
You want tech like this, you should've cut off your own hand.
Mack.
Okay.
Looks like these guys tore each other apart.
Zhang Wei, resident of Monterey Park.
Organ donor.
Say anything about him being a flesh-hungry rage monster?
Uh, no, I'm not seeing anything about that here, so we have to assume that he wasn't until he came in contact with whatever's in that trailer.
Not much here that'll lead us anywhere.
Well... there's that.
There was no buyer there.
No, no, no.
No!
Please, God, no!
No!
I don't deserve to die!
- No!
No!
- Everyone says that.
No!
No!
No!
Yeah, those chargers are hard to find.
Between "Fast and Furious" and "Dukes of Hazzard,"
they wrecked a lot of them.
My boyfriend wrecked his in a street race.
He's pretty broken up.
I guess he was more attached to it than I thought.
I ain't seen none around here, though.
- Sorry.
- All right.
Thanks, man.
Hey, uh, most of them wrecked movie cars, they're dumped at El Monte Junk and Salvage.
If your boyfriend wants to fix his ride up, might want to go over there and find scraps.
Thanks.
Maybe he'll go there.
Daisy's in Los Angeles.
There was an eyewitness, now dead, and I just received Yo-Yo's check-in report a week early, which means Coulson and Mack are there, too,
- no doubt, trying to track Daisy down.
- Sounds right.
You know it is, because according to the logs, you called Coulson back to H.Q. for resupply yourself.
Why, if not to give him that intel in person, knowing it's against the Director's orders?
I didn't send them.
I don't have the authority.
- They acted on their own.
- You knew I'd find out.
Why not tell me?
I have daily lie detection.
- That's why.
- And now I have to report it, which means now I either look like I'm incompetent
- or colluding with you.
- Wouldn't want you falling out of favor with the director.
Okay.
I get it.
It's abundantly clear you're uncomfortable with my new position ...
I just want to know how comfortable you are with it.
You actually trust this guy?
Our team split up to lead departments, given different colors.
'Cause we're experts?
No.
I think the Director broke up the band on purpose.
Of course he did!
As soon as Talbot gave the location of this base to the president, things changed.
I knew we'd be divided, undermined, kept in the dark, so I have been clawing for as much power as I can possibly grab to keep a modicum of control over any of this.
After all we've been through...
I don't trust the new Director, but he trusts me, so now, in order to keep that trust,
I must take the appropriate action to address this break in protocol.
I'm sending you and your strike team to take Coulson and Mack out of the field, by force, if necessary.
Clean up whatever mess he's in.
- That's an order.
- Yes, ma'am.
Place them at the four corners of the exterior of the building.
That'll give us visuals through the walls.
This could be very dangerous.
- So much could go wrong.
- Ultron, yes.
I know.
But this is not A.I. A.I. is banned, and that's good.
This is mimicry of human behavior.
Still, in the wrong hands, this could be used as a weapon.
- Is that the idea?
- No, absolutely not.
No ...
Look, I know the dangers.
That's why I've been ...
I've been reticent to divulge.
I don't know these new people at S.H.I.E.L.D.
But a weapon is absolutely not the idea.
Well, then, why?
What's she for?
Why not let Aida tell you herself?
Hello.
I'm glad to finally shake your hand, Leopold.
Where's Jemma?
We were hoping that she would come.
S-She's, uh...
indisposed, I'm afraid.
Aida...
- I was wondering ...
- Yes, Agent Fitz?
I was wondering if you could tell me exactly what it is you are designed for.
Of course.
Dr. Radcliffe, time and again, has expressed his deep regret for causing pain when all he ever wanted was to prevent it.
He speaks often of the pain that you and Agent Simmons have had to suffer, having lost so many friends ...
Lincoln Campbell,
Andrew Garner, Antoine Triplett ...
Okay, stop it, stop.
You don't have to list them.
Sorry.
The hope is that I will be able to prevent future tragedies ... save the lives of agents by putting myself in harm's way in their place.
- To kill?
- No.
I am incapable of that.
I will protect.
I will serve as a decoy target, a safeguard...
- ... a shield.
- Okay.
T-Turn her off.
We can't tell Simmons about this.
What?
Don't we want to move forward?
Her approval is ...
This is too dangerous to show the new Director.
We don't know what he'd do with it.
And she would have to tell him, so... she can't know.
- Not until...
- Until... ?
Until she's perfect.
They're walking in now, six.
Really convivial-looking fellows.
At least four of them are packing.
We should be tapped into surveillance now.
Let's see what we get.
Where are the other two men?
We had to leave them at the pick-up site.
Explain.
Those guys were transferring the box into the armored transport.
Maybe they peeked inside or something.
But they went berserk and tore into each other.
There was blood everywhere.
We put two bullets in each of them and locked them in the truck.
No, no.
Look, we were freaking out.
We had to get out of there!
Did you burn their bodies or dump the truck in the ocean?
Because if not, they can be traced back here.
They probably saw what was in this box and were fighting over it, you idiot!
I have been told it's powerful enough to bring our new enhanced enemies to their knees.
We get on comms and call the Zephyr for backup, headquarters will know we're on Daisy's trail.
No orders to pull out.
She's been tracking this sale.
- She could show up here any minute.
- I don't know.
Let's let this play out, see if anyone else makes an appearance.
Excuse me.
Uh, the yard's closing.
To sell a junker, you can call the number on the gate.
Oh, no, I'm not here for that.
I, uh ...
Uh, sorry.
What's your name?
Robbie.
Well, Robbie, I am looking for a guy with a sweet black '69 Charger.
Maybe he bought some parts here.
Sorry.
Doesn't ring a bell.
I only work nights once a week.
Uh, well, maybe I'll ...
I'll come back in the morning.
Thank you.
Or...
there's a book of sales you can flip through in the main office.
Not really an office.
More of a trailer, but I can show you.
That would be great, thank you.
The hell... ?
What was that?
A breath of fresh air.
Get away from me!
That's it there.
- So, you live around here?
- No, I used to.
I'm just in town for a couple days, soaking up the sun.
Strange place to spend your vacation.
Not a great neighborhood.
So... you've got the devil inside you, too.
What's going on, guys?
Call for backup, yeah?
We can't wait for Daisy.
These guys might kill somebody besides each other.
Yeah.
Us.
Z One, we got a situation.
We need a little help here.
That was efficient.
You guys know what to do.
Damn.
All clear.
You shouldn't have gotten involved.
Serial killers always complain when we try to intervene.
I only kill asesinos who deserve it.
It's vengeance, chica.
For what?
You killed a detective.
But he had blood on his hands.
- A teacher!
- A pedophile.
You don't get to decide who deserves to die.
I'm not the one who decides.
Do it.
I deserve it.
Do it.
Hey.
Thank for the ride, Janet.
You never accept rides.
Bus break down?
Or you still trying to holler at Janet's little sister?
Maybe.
I only needed a ride to help Canelo balance some books because my brother didn't finish high school.
Yo, I finished high school...
in the 11th grade.
"Everyone's attached to something."
We'll return in a moment.
- Spent a lot of time in here?
- Too much.
My wallet's starting to get sick of it.
Your little side mission didn't go unnoticed.
Well, you showed up, so, yeah.
The Director will want to have words with you at H.Q.
- No Daisy, huh?
- No.
But she was tracking these guys, so maybe this is a win.
I don't know.
The ground team is checking for contagion, but hopefully, whatever messed with these guys' heads is no longer an issue.
We're gonna analyze the box it came in.
It's good...
to have a moment, just us.
It's been a long time since we had a moment alone.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
Just a long day.
Well, take advantage of the down time.
Who knows what tomorrow holds?
Previously on "marvel's agents of s.H.I.E.L.D."... [ rumbling ] call the director.
We struck out again.

[ ghostly shriek ] and I think I may have stumbled upon a serial killer.

I don't trust the new director, but he trusts me.

It's been a long time since we had a moment alone.

Yeah.

Oh, my gosh.
It's hard to keep track in this thing.
We shouldn't have to stay on clock when we're moving through time zones.
I mean, what is that...
three continents in two days?
If you count Berlin.
We were only there three hours.
Yeah, we knew that Inhuman call was a hoax as soon as we stepped foot in the apartment, saw that bong.
- I could smell it from the hallway.
- Jokers.
Hungry for attention.
And potato chips.
If the munchies was a superpower, they'd be signing the Sokovia Accords as we speak.
[Breathes deeply]
You should let me work on Lola.
I warned you.
Everything in Lola is custom.
Yeah, yeah, everything is custom.
But it would be something to do.
There's only so many times a guy can win cash off you... sir.
You got to stop calling me that.
- We're being called back to H.Q.
- They say why?
We're not due for a restock for another 10 days.
- No idea.
They said it's classified.
- Oh, everything is nowadays.
[Breathes deeply] All right, we'll need full inventory.
Medical, provisions, fuel cells, and make sure you tell the crew they'll need to call ahead if they want off our next deployment.
Agent Thompson...
- Wonder what that's about.
- Oh, I don't know.
- It'll be good to see Fitz and Simmons.
- And May.
Yeah...
I think you look forward to that more than I do.
Hyah!
What was his mistake?
[Music]
You know I'm not gonna talk.
He didn't anticipate your back kick.
Opened himself up.
His mistake was he tapped out.
[Motor whirring]
- Piper.
- Okay, people!
What, you never seen the biggest plane ever built before?
!
Next pairing, on the mat!
- How long has it been?
- Six weeks in the air.
Only the Quinjet touched down.
- Is that a record for Zephyr One?
- It is.
It was supposed to be even longer.
- You know who called us in?
- I do.
You?
Okay.
Now I know something's up.
I got word from contacts in law enforcement, Los Angeles.
Two civilians were violently killed.
Mack:
Mysterious burns, heads bashed in, spine pulled out of his...
Wow.
Many conflicting accounts, but all agree... it was odd.
Odd?
Isn't that our wheelhouse?
He's right.
Why call us in?
We could be headed to the scene right now to confirm the presence of an enhanced person,
- if there is one.
- If it checks out, we bag and tag.
We handle these on the fly.
Didn't exactly want to send this out on the wire.
May, you're not sharing again.
Now would be a really good time to share.
The police also have another victim in custody.
Critical condition.
Under sedation, he mentioned seeing a girl, saying it was the one from the news.
Quake.
Which you didn't want to send over the wire.
You were pulled off Daisy's case.
The Director thinks she slipped through our fingers too many times.
The Director thinks you let her.
No, we pursued her.
She was a ghost.
Well, in his infinite wisdom, he says you're now forbidden to.
But you're telling us this because...?
In case we want to do something about it.
Look, I can bury this until the official police report comes through.
That'll buy us a few hours lead time.
Get to L.A., sniff around.
Yeah.
We have an active Inhuman asset in Los Angeles that's due for a check-in soon enough.
It'll justify our presence there, but as soon as the report's filed, they'll pull us out.
And the armed forces will be sent in after her.
With orders to kill.
- To kill?
- If she's responsible for these bodies.
- That's not Daisy's M.O.
- The world knows her as Quake, and Quake is an outlaw who takes down banks and bridges.
- Oh, come on.
We both know
- She's hunting violent radicals.
she's tracking these fanatics, the Watchdogs, trying to take down their funding, their... their escape routes.
Regardless, you should fuel up and get back up in the air ASAP.
Find her before the military does something bad.
Or Daisy does something worse.
[Monitors beeping]
Man:
Hey.
You can't be here.
Stop right there.
[Rumbling] [Screams]
How are we feeling today?
[Rumbling]
I've been tracking weapon sales, and I know you were hired to steal one.
You even jacked a big rig to help carry it out.
We were just paid for a smash-and-grab job.
Who was that hunting you?
[Grunts] Man:
Open the door!
He nailed me, but we almost got away.
Who was it?
- Did he kill my friends?
- All but one.
But you're gonna have to give me a little bit more if I'm gonna find him alive.
[Shuddered breathing]
Save him, please, before he gets burned, too.
You'll see your buddy again once you heal up.
- Just tell me what's...
- [Grunting] No.
No.
It's too late for me.
They say when the Rider burns you [breathing heavily] he burns your soul.
[Grunting]
And a soul can never heal.
[Grunting]
[Indistinct shouting]
[Rumbling]
Man:
Stop right there!
[Echoing] Hello?
Hello?
I hear my voice echo, but it sounds strange in my head.
The detail is amazing.
However, I am 3 feet off the ground.
Fitz:
Wait.
What?
Hold on.
Damn it.
Uh, well, I did adjust the Y axis earlier for some reason.
- What does that look like now?
- Better.
The CPU seems to be handling the high poly count.
Textures are impeccable.
We should build a place to get away... a meadow or a cottage somewhere.
[Sighs] I wish it were ever this quiet.
[Monitors beeping]
Direct-current stimulation.
Creates the other senses like touch and taste but also takes feedback.
So I've just mapped your brain's response...
Response to the environment.
Of course.
Dr. Radcliffe came up with the architecture?
Yeah.
Yeah, he calls it "The Framework."
But all the transcranial apparatus, that's all me.
No.
Of course, you're brilliant, too.
Of course.
'Cause soon you won't even need the eyewear or the earwear, 'cause it'll all be inside your head.
So May's strike team will be able to train virtually instead of May constantly breaking their ribs.
Nathanson:
Hey, hey.
Authorized personnel only, pal.
No pass, no entry.
- Who the hell are you?
- Leave them be, Nathanson.
They have more reason to be here than you do.
Wow.
A lot of new faces.
Good to see yours.
Six weeks.
That's a record.
- Heard you got a promotion.
- Oh, yeah, and a title.
Yeah, Special Advisor to the Director in Science and Technology.
Or "SADIST."
- They keeping you busy?
- With busywork, mostly.
Yeah, and random state-of-the-art lie-detector tests.
So that's the cost of being in the Director's inner circle.
Yeah, he's paranoid about what happened the last time S.H.I.E.L.D. was government-run.
Calls it his Widespread Infiltration Monitoring Program.
Or "WIMP." Hey, uh, you should join us 'cause we're gonna go to Radcliffe's and watch the
Aberdeen-Inverness Caley Thistle League cup final.
They're...
Those are football teams.
I'm not sure they are, Turbo.
Unfortunately, we have to be wheels-up in 10 minutes, so...
Okay.
All right.
Well, strictly business, then.
Aw, yeah.
New toys?
The exploding pen that you asked for.
I can't imagine a use for it.
You never wanted one?
[Chuckles]
And for you, Direct... uh, Agent Coulson with new bells and whistles.
And the directions will be there when you boot it up.
What's, uh...
What's the assignment?
[Sighs]
- It's classified.
- Right.
Everything is these days.
- Fitz, sadly, um...
- Yeah, you can't make the match, either.
- I have to finish my reports.
- Yeah, no, I get it.
That's okay.
Just a shame we hardly get to see each other.
- Any of us.
- [Sighs] Yes, well...
At least it's better than the friends we'll never see again.
[Sighs]
[Laptop beeps] [Music]
_
_ [Door closes]
[Breathing shakily]
We just stole a box.
I don't even know what was inside of it.
We...
We loaded it onto an 18-wheeler, we parked it in a warehouse, and we just left it.
Man:
Left it for who?
[Groans] The Chinatown Crew.
They set the job up and were willing to pay big.
[Grunts, groans]
Lies.
Aryan Brotherhood working with the Chinese?
I swear!
I swear that's all I know.
Where's this warehouse?
I...
I can't tell you that, man.
My people are gonna be mowed down in the payback... the ones you didn't already kill.
If you don't tell me, you'll have to tell him.
Coulson:
This guy's missing.
The rest are dead.
Aryan Brotherhood.
They're not my kind of brothers.
They've been know to work for cash.
Burglary, assault... sort of the value meal of hired guns.
They're suspected in the recent theft of this big rig.
- Probably prepping for a larger score.
- Big, yellow, hard to hide.
So, what, are we looking for this thing?
And if Daisy's chasing the same angle, maybe we get to the finish line first.
I'll greet her when she arrives.
- Davis:
Agent Coulson?
- Davis.
Preparing for decent.
Inhuman asset will be waiting on the tarmac.
[Tablet beeping]
What?
[Music]
- How's your wife, Davis?
- Getting bigger every day.
- Oh.
Don't tell her that.
- More beautiful every day.
[Chuckles]
There you go.
Mack.
Mack:
Yo-Yo.
[Sighs]
- Just have a few questions.
- I'm all yours.
Uh, so, I see you went to Colombia for a week.
Mm-hmm.
Mm.
And, uh, tickets to Miami coming up.
Yes.
Do you watch me sleep or shower or...?
Just procedure.
You don't have to use a satellite to get to know me better.
Just ask me to dinner again.
You know the rules about fraternizing with assets in the field. [Chuckles]
Oh, we haven't fraternized anything yet.
And I thought you were breaking the rules, coming to do my checkup early just to see me.
Or are you here because, uh, there's been a lot of little earthquakes lately?
Daisy could be in the area.
But officially, that's not the mission.
Doesn't matter.
We'll never find her.
She's always one step ahead.
What is the official mission?
Can I help?
Here's where I have to remind you that Sokovia Accords,
- which you signed...
- Oh, all right.
...require approval by the United Nations subcommittee...
- before an enhanced indiv...
- Rules, rules, rules.
Blah, blah, blah.
S.H.I.E.L.D. moves too slow now, Turtleman.
- I prefer to move fast.
- Uh...
Mack, they found the truck.
Good to see you, too, Coulson!
Well, if you're in Miami, look me up.
Just because we can't work together doesn't mean we can't live a little.
[Sighs]
[Crowd cheering on television]
[Doorbell rings]
Hey, just in time.
They've just taken to the pitch.
Where's Jemma?
Is she not coming?
Yeah, she wanted to.
Same story.
All work and no play, huh?
That's a bit disappointing.
Still, make yourself comfortable.
I'm just, uh, finishing cleaning up.
[Music]
Yeah, should be pretty lopsided, don't you think?
Their keeper's absolutely crap...
Oh, my gosh!
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I had no idea there was somebody here.
Hello.
[Sighs] You...
You weren't meant to see that.
Hello.
I'm glad to final...
- Hello.
I'm glad to final...
- Fitz, meet Aida.
- Hello.
I'm glad to final...
- She's, uh, crashed.
Hello.
I'm glad to final...
Hello.
I'm glad to final...
Hello.
I'm glad to final...
Hello.
I'm glad to final...
Hello.
I'm glad to final...
Hello.
I'm glad to final...
[Powers down]
[Remote beeping]
- What the hell?
- Well, I've just upped her PSU to compensate for image processing.
Must have overcranked it.
I'll reboot.
Unh-unh, that's not what I meant.
I meant...
- ...what the hell?
!
- Well, you've already met Aida, digital personal assistant, as a voice on the computer.
So, uh...
- I built her a body.
- Yeah, a naked body.
I-I was just now installing new hardware, updating her gyroscopic sensors.
I'm not some sicko.
When did you build this?
Have you forgotten the very strict stipulations that came with your pardon?
You are not allowed experimentation
- without approval and oversight!
- Oversight, I know.
I'm well aware of that, yeah.
That's why I wanted Simmons here.
I wanted to show both of you.
Look.
This has been a lifelong dream of mine, Fitz.
When I saw the work you and Simmons were doing in replicating human tissue and internal bone structure in Coulson's hand, I knew...
I knew right then that this was within reach.
- A robot?
- Not just a robot.
It's one that can cross the uncanny valley and come out the other side...
pass for a human.
I mean, it has bloody micro-expressions.
She.
It's a...
It's definitely a "she" 'cause I saw...
- Yes...
- She has micro-expressions, full range of motion.
I mean, physically, it's...
- she's nearly perfect.
- She is very realistic.
[Music]
Now, mentally, well, you've spoken with Aida.
She's bright, she laughs at the jokes
I programmed her to recognize, but she's never pass the Turing test.
At the moment, that's a pipe dream.
However, I think, with your help...
No, no.
No, no, no, no!
We have to report this right away.
- You could lose everything.
- I know.
- Or you could go to jail.
- I know!
I know, you're right.
Full disclosure at this time is the best course of action.
I...
I agree.
Hmm.
At least let me show you how it works.
[Air brakes hiss]
They're in town.
I supposed you guessed that, texting me.
They're looking for a truck.
That mean you have something for me?
They watch my every move, but certain moves they can't see.
You can't get these over the counter.
S.H.I.E.L.D. issue for rapid bone healing, yes?
I know you splintered your bones when you first powered up.
- Are you pushing yourself too hard?
- Don't worry about me.
You can't use your powers too much.
- Your body will break down.
- I'm fine.
I'm surprised you're still in town.
You're usually moving and moving.
Are you, uh, still hunting those perros rabiosos?
It's not just the Watchdogs now.
Local gangs have been working for them, which I... don't understand.
I was tracing the sale of a weapon, and I...
I think I may have stumbled upon a serial killer.
Ooh.
Fun.
He live around here?
He mostly hits this area, but he's hard to track down, leaves no traces behind, operates alone.
Sound familiar?
I thought maybe you were, uh, growing roots, they say.
- L.A. used to be where you hang out, no?
- No roots.
Everyone gets attached to something eventually.
Don't forget to wait two stops after I get off.
Yeah, yeah.
Hey.
Send me a picture of this guy.
Maybe I can cover some ground if I know what he looks like.
No, I still haven't gotten a good look at him yet, so just...
take care of yourself, okay?
But thank you for the S.H.I.E.L.D. intel.
They won't give up on you, especially Coulson.
All he wants is to find you.
Well, that's too bad, 'cause there's only one thing I want.
Oh, yeah?
What's that?
Nothing to lose.
Here's the Mapping-Action Eyewear you requested.
Should help your team in case of a blind takedown.
- Great.
Thanks.
- I need you to sign for it.
I don't get the new color-coded security-level rainbow of...
- What's it called?
- The "Spectrum of Security."
Why do I, level red, have to go through you, level orange, to request hardware?
Shouldn't red be higher than orange?
Well, orange encompasses both red and yellow, so...
It's hard to explain, but the Director didn't want to use numbers because he didn't want any team member to feel less than.
Well, you do have a higher clearance than me.
Only in most instances.
I feel less than.
Hey, we just had a report come in.
A death in a hospital in Los Angeles.
Suspicious circumstances.
Suspect is an Asian female.
You think it might be Daisy.
I'm going to look into it.
I just wondered if you'd heard anything from your law-enforcement contacts?
I'm mostly in the dark these days.
Why don't you ask the Director?
Since you're one of the few people allowed or willing to do that.
[Spray-pain can rattles]
What you got there?
Didn't hear?
Word is, he hit again last night.
- Two dead in the street.
- Who?
Ghost Rider.
You must not be from around here.
Do you know where I can find him?
Nobody does.
Everybody that sees his face ends up on this wall.
"Everyone gets attached to something."
[Engine revs, tires screech]
Man:
We got to get this truck out of here.
What are you, the Feds?
Something like that.
We'll be sealing the scene.
Not for long, I hope.
I was just gonna have this guy tow this thing away so me and my crew can get back to work.
We got this.
Man:
This warehouse usually sits empty.
We were gonna store some inventory today.
Found the lock broken and this big, honkin' thing inside.
- Have at it.
- Coulson:
Thank you.
[Wrist beeps]
[Music]
Not fair.
You want tech like this, you should've cut off your own hand.
Mack.
Okay.
Mack:
Looks like these guys tore each other apart.
Zhang Wei, resident of Monterey Park.
Organ donor.
Say anything about him being a flesh-hungry rage monster?
Uh, no, I'm not seeing anything about that here, so we have to assume that he wasn't until he came in contact with whatever's in that trailer.
Not much here that'll lead us anywhere.
Well... there's that.
[Door slams]
[Keys rattling]
There was no buyer there.
[Car door closes]
[Engine starts, revs]
No, no, no.
No!
Please, God, no!
No!
I don't deserve to die!
- No!
No!
- Everyone says that.
No!
No!
No!
Diego:
Yeah, those chargers are hard to find.
Between "Fast and Furious" and "Dukes of Hazzard,"
they wrecked a lot of them.
My boyfriend wrecked his in a street race.
He's pretty broken up.
I guess he was more attached to it than I thought.
I ain't seen none around here, though.
- Sorry.
- All right.
Thanks, man.
Hey, uh, most of them wrecked movie cars, they're dumped at El Monte Junk and Salvage.
If your boyfriend wants to fix his ride up, might want to go over there and find scraps.
Thanks.
Maybe he'll go there.
Simmons:
Daisy's in Los Angeles.
There was an eyewitness, now dead, and I just received Yo-Yo's check-in report a week early, which means Coulson and Mack are there, too,
- no doubt, trying to track Daisy down.
- Sounds right.
You know it is, because according to the logs, you called Coulson back to H.Q. for resupply yourself.
Why, if not to give him that intel in person, knowing it's against the Director's orders?
I didn't send them.
I don't have the authority.
- They acted on their own.
- You knew I'd find out.
Why not tell me?
I have daily lie detection.
- That's why.
- And now I have to report it, which means now I either look like I'm incompetent
- or colluding with you.
- Wouldn't want you falling out of favor with the director.
[Sighs]
Okay.
I get it.
It's abundantly clear you're uncomfortable with my new position...
I just want to know how comfortable you are with it.
You actually trust this guy?
Our team split up to lead departments, given different colors.
'Cause we're experts?
No.
I think the Director broke up the band on purpose.
Of course he did!
[Sighs]
As soon as Talbot gave the location of this base to the president, things changed.
I knew we'd be divided, undermined, kept in the dark, so I have been clawing for as much power as I can possibly grab to keep a modicum of control over any of this.
After all we've been through...
[Sighs]
I don't trust the new Director, but he trusts me, so now, in order to keep that trust,
I must take the appropriate action to address this break in protocol.
I'm sending you and your strike team to take Coulson and Mack out of the field, by force, if necessary.
Clean up whatever mess he's in.
- That's an order.
- Yes, ma'am.
Mack:
Place them at the four corners of the exterior of the building.
That'll give us visuals through the walls.
Fitz:
This could be very dangerous.
- So much could go wrong.
- Ultron, yes.
I know.
But this is not A.I. A.I. is banned, and that's good.
This is mimicry of human behavior.
Still, in the wrong hands, this could be used as a weapon.
- Is that the idea?
- No, absolutely not.
No...
Look, I know the dangers.
That's why I've been...
I've been reticent to divulge.
I don't know these new people at S.H.I.E.L.D.
But a weapon is absolutely not the idea.
Well, then, why?
What's she for?
Why not let Aida tell you herself?
[Remote beeps] [Silent whir]
[Music]
Hello.
I'm glad to finally shake your hand, Leopold.
Where's Jemma?
We were hoping that she would come.
S-She's, uh...
indisposed, I'm afraid.
Aida...
- I was wondering...
- Yes, Agent Fitz?
[Breathes deeply]
I was wondering if you could tell me exactly what it is you are designed for.
Of course.
Dr. Radcliffe, time and again, has expressed his deep regret for causing pain when all he ever wanted was to prevent it.
He speaks often of the pain that you and Agent Simmons have had to suffer, having lost so many friends...
Lincoln Campbell,
Andrew Garner, Antoine Triplett...
Okay, stop it, stop.
You don't have to list them.
Sorry.
The hope is that I will be able to prevent future tragedies... save the lives of agents by putting myself in harm's way in their place.
- To kill?
- No.
I am incapable of that.
I will protect.
I will serve as a decoy target, a safeguard...
- ...a shield.
- Okay.
T-Turn her off.
[Breathes deeply]
[Remote beeps] [Powers down]
[Sighs]
We can't tell Simmons about this.
What?
Don't we want to move forward?
Her approval is...
This is too dangerous to show the new Director.
We don't know what he'd do with it.
And she would have to tell him, so... she can't know.
- Not until...
- Until...?
Until she's perfect.
[Music]
[Music]
Coulson:
They're walking in now, six.
Really convivial-looking fellows.
At least four of them are packing.
Mack:
We should be tapped into surveillance now.
Let's see what we get.
[Tablet beeps]
Where are the other two men?
We had to leave them at the pick-up site.
Explain.
Those guys were transferring the box into the armored transport.
Maybe they peeked inside or something.
But they went berserk and tore into each other.
There was blood everywhere.
We put two bullets in each of them and locked them in the truck.
No, no.
Look, we were freaking out.
We had to get out of there!
Did you burn their bodies or dump the truck in the ocean?
Because if not, they can be traced back here.
They probably saw what was in this box and were fighting over it, you idiot!
I have been told it's powerful enough to bring our new enhanced enemies to their knees.
We get on comms and call the Zephyr for backup, headquarters will know we're on Daisy's trail.
No orders to pull out.
She's been tracking this sale.
- She could show up here any minute.
- I don't know.
Let's let this play out, see if anyone else makes an appearance.
[Music]
Daisy:
Excuse me.
Uh, the yard's closing.
To sell a junker, you can call the number on the gate.
Oh, no, I'm not here for that.
I, uh...
Uh, sorry.
What's your name?
Robbie.
Well, Robbie, I am looking for a guy with a sweet black '69 Charger.
Maybe he bought some parts here.
Sorry.
Doesn't ring a bell.
I only work nights once a week.
Uh, well, maybe I'll...
I'll come back in the morning.
Thank you.
Or...
there's a book of sales you can flip through in the main office.
Not really an office.
More of a trailer, but I can show you.
That would be great, thank you.
[Men gasping]
[Tablet whirs] The hell...?
What was that?
A breath of fresh air.
[Ghostly shriek] [Gasps]
[Men grunting]
Get away from me!
That's it there.
- So, you live around here?
- No, I used to.
I'm just in town for a couple days, soaking up the sun.
Strange place to spend your vacation.
[Keys rattling]
Not a great neighborhood.
[Rumbling]
[Breathing heavily]
So... you've got the devil inside you, too.
What's going on, guys?
[Tablet whirs]
Call for backup, yeah?
We can't wait for Daisy.
These guys might kill somebody besides each other.
Yeah.
Us.
Z One, we got a situation.
We need a little help here.
[Gunshot]
That was efficient.
[Tablet beeps]
[Goggles beep, whir]
[Goggles beeping, whirring]
You guys know what to do.
[Music]
Damn.
May:
All clear.
[Fighting sounds] [Music]
[Rumbling]
You shouldn't have gotten involved.
Serial killers always complain when we try to intervene.
I only kill asesinos who deserve it.
It's vengeance, chica.
For what?
You killed a detective.
But he had blood on his hands.
- A teacher!
- A pedophile.
[Rumbling]
You don't get to decide who deserves to die.
I'm not the one who decides.
[Grunts]
[Music]
[Rumbling]
[Rumbling]
[Panting]
Do it. [Panting] I deserve it.
Do it.
[Grunts]
[Engine starts]
[Tires screech]
[Grunts]
[Brakes squeak]
[Music]
[Music stops]
Hey.
Thank for the ride, Janet.
You never accept rides.
Bus break down?
Or you still trying to holler at Janet's little sister?
Maybe.
I only needed a ride to help Canelo balance some books because my brother didn't finish high school.
Yo, I finished high school...
in the 11th grade.
[Chuckles]
"Everyone's attached to something."
[Engine starts]
Coulson:
We'll return in a moment.
[Indistinct conversations]
- Spent a lot of time in here?
- Too much.
My wallet's starting to get sick of it.
Your little side mission didn't go unnoticed.
Well, you showed up, so, yeah.
The Director will want to have words with you at H.Q.
[Chuckles]
[Sighs]
- No Daisy, huh?
- No.
But she was tracking these guys, so maybe this is a win.
I don't know.
The ground team is checking for contagion, but hopefully, whatever messed with these guys' heads is no longer an issue.
We're gonna analyze the box it came in.
It's good...
to have a moment, just us.
It's been a long time since we had a moment alone.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
Just a long day.
Well, take advantage of the down time.
Who knows what tomorrow holds?
It's coming!
Get ready!
Go, man, go!
Damn it!
Damn it!
Engine's dead!
Get it.
Kill it!
Shoot anything that moves.
Help.
He...
He got me.
He'll kill us all.
Give me that damn thing.
Get back!
Shoot it!
Shoot it now!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No, please!
No!
4x01 - "The Ghost"
You need to sacrifice everything if you want to survive.
Hmm.
That's funny.
'Cause I thought I would just...
Mm.
Yeah, that's one way to go.
Want a beer?
It's 6:00 in the morning.
What, are you Hemingway?
No, is that real?
When did we cross the North Pole?
An hour ago.
Oh, my gosh.
It's hard to keep track in this thing.
We shouldn't have to stay on clock when we're moving through time zones.
I mean, what is that...
three continents in two days?
If you count Berlin.
We were only there three hours.
Yeah, we knew that Inhuman call was a hoax as soon as we stepped foot in the apartment, saw that bong.
- I could smell it from the hallway.
- Jokers.
Hungry for attention.
And potato chips.
If the munchies was a superpower, they'd be signing the Sokovia Accords as we speak.
You should let me work on Lola.
I warned you.
Everything in Lola is custom.
Yeah, yeah, everything is custom.
But it would be something to do.
There's only so many times a guy can win cash off you... sir.
You got to stop calling me that.
- We're being called back to H.Q.
- They say why?
We're not due for a restock for another 10 days.
- No idea.
They said it's classified.
- Oh, everything is nowadays.
All right, we'll need full inventory.
Medical, provisions, fuel cells, and make sure you tell the crew they'll need to call ahead if they want off our next deployment.
Agent Thompson...
- Wonder what that's about.
- Oh, I don't know.
- It'll be good to see Fitz and Simmons.
- And May.
Yeah...
I think you look forward to that more than I do.
Hyah!
What was his mistake?
You know I'm not gonna talk.
He didn't anticipate your back kick.
Opened himself up.
His mistake was he tapped out.
- Piper.
- Okay, people!
What, you never seen the biggest plane ever built before?
!
Next pairing, on the mat!
- How long has it been?
- Six weeks in the air.
Only the Quinjet touched down.
- Is that a record for Zephyr One?
- It is.
It was supposed to be even longer.
- You know who called us in?
- I do.
You?
Okay.
Now I know something's up.
I got word from contacts in law enforcement, Los Angeles.
Two civilians were violently killed.
Mysterious burns, heads bashed in, spine pulled out of his...
Wow.
Many conflicting accounts, but all agree... it was odd.
Odd?
Isn't that our wheelhouse?
He's right.
Why call us in?
We could be headed to the scene right now to confirm the presence of an enhanced person,
- if there is one.
- If it checks out, we bag and tag.
We handle these on the fly.
Didn't exactly want to send this out on the wire.
May, you're not sharing again.
Now would be a really good time to share.
The police also have another victim in custody.
Critical condition.
Under sedation, he mentioned seeing a girl, saying it was the one from the news.
Quake.
Which you didn't want to send over the wire.
You were pulled off Daisy's case.
The Director thinks she slipped through our fingers too many times.
The Director thinks you let her.
No, we pursued her.
She was a ghost.
Well, in his infinite wisdom, he says you're now forbidden to.
But you're telling us this because...?
In case we want to do something about it.
Look, I can bury this until the official police report comes through.
That'll buy us a few hours lead time.
Get to L.A., sniff around.
Yeah.
We have an active Inhuman asset in Los Angeles that's due for a check-in soon enough.
It'll justify our presence there, but as soon as the report's filed, they'll pull us out.
And the armed forces will be sent in after her.
With orders to kill.
- To kill?
- If she's responsible for these bodies.
- That's not Daisy's M.O.
- The world knows her as Quake, and Quake is an outlaw who takes down banks and bridges.
- Oh, come on.
We both know
- She's hunting violent radicals.
she's tracking these fanatics, the Watchdogs, trying to take down their funding, their... their escape routes.
Regardless, you should fuel up and get back up in the air ASAP.
Find her before the military does something bad.
Or Daisy does something worse.
Hey.
You can't be here.
Stop right there.
How are we feeling today?
I've been tracking weapon sales, and I know you were hired to steal one.
You even jacked a big rig to help carry it out.
We were just paid for a smash-and-grab job.
Who was that hunting you?
Open the door!
He nailed me, but we almost got away.
Who was it?
- Did he kill my friends?
- All but one.
But you're gonna have to give me a little bit more if I'm gonna find him alive.
Save him, please, before he gets burned, too.
You'll see your buddy again once you heal up.
- Just tell me what's...
- No.
No.
It's too late for me.
They say when the Rider burns you he burns your soul.
And a soul can never heal.
Stop right there!
Hello?
Hello?
I hear my voice echo, but it sounds strange in my head.
The detail is amazing.
However, I am 3 feet off the ground.
Wait.
What?
Hold on.
Damn it.
Uh, well, I did adjust the Y axis earlier for some reason.
- What does that look like now?
- Better.
The CPU seems to be handling the high poly count.
Textures are impeccable.
We should build a place to get away... a meadow or a cottage somewhere.
I wish it were ever this quiet.
Direct-current stimulation.
Creates the other senses like touch and taste but also takes feedback.
So I've just mapped your brain's response...
Response to the environment.
Of course.
Dr. Radcliffe came up with the architecture?
Yeah.
Yeah, he calls it "The Framework."
But all the transcranial apparatus, that's all me.
No.
Of course, you're brilliant, too.
Of course.
'Cause soon you won't even need the eyewear or the earwear, 'cause it'll all be inside your head.
So May's strike team will be able to train virtually instead of May constantly breaking their ribs.
Hey, hey.
Authorized personnel only, pal.
No pass, no entry.
- Who the hell are you?
- Leave them be, Nathanson.
They have more reason to be here than you do.
Wow.
A lot of new faces.
Good to see yours.
Six weeks.
That's a record.
- Heard you got a promotion.
- Oh, yeah, and a title.
Yeah, Special Advisor to the Director in Science and Technology.
Or "SADIST."
- They keeping you busy?
- With busywork, mostly.
Yeah, and random state-of-the-art lie-detector tests.
So that's the cost of being in the Director's inner circle.
Yeah, he's paranoid about what happened the last time S.H.I.E.L.D. was government-run.
Calls it his Widespread Infiltration Monitoring Program.
Or "WIMP." Hey, uh, you should join us 'cause we're gonna go to Radcliffe's and watch the
Aberdeen-Inverness Caley Thistle League cup final.
They're...
Those are football teams.
I'm not sure they are, Turbo.
Unfortunately, we have to be wheels-up in 10 minutes, so...
Okay.
All right.
Well, strictly business, then.
Aw, yeah.
New toys?
The exploding pen that you asked for.
I can't imagine a use for it.
You never wanted one?
And for you, Direct... uh, Agent Coulson with new bells and whistles.
And the directions will be there when you boot it up.
What's, uh...
What's the assignment?
- It's classified.
- Right.
Everything is these days.
- Fitz, sadly, um...
- Yeah, you can't make the match, either.
- I have to finish my reports.
- Yeah, no, I get it.
That's okay.
Just a shame we hardly get to see each other.
- Any of us.
- Yes, well...
At least it's better than the friends we'll never see again.
_
_
We just stole a box.
I don't even know what was inside of it.
We...
We loaded it onto an 18-wheeler, we parked it in a warehouse, and we just left it.
Left it for who?
The Chinatown Crew.
They set the job up and were willing to pay big.
Lies.
Aryan Brotherhood working with the Chinese?
I swear!
I swear that's all I know.
Where's this warehouse?
I...
I can't tell you that, man.
My people are gonna be mowed down in the payback... the ones you didn't already kill.
If you don't tell me, you'll have to tell him.
This guy's missing.
The rest are dead.
Aryan Brotherhood.
They're not my kind of brothers.
They've been know to work for cash.
Burglary, assault... sort of the value meal of hired guns.
They're suspected in the recent theft of this big rig.
- Probably prepping for a larger score.
- Big, yellow, hard to hide.
So, what, are we looking for this thing?
And if Daisy's chasing the same angle, maybe we get to the finish line first.
I'll greet her when she arrives.
- Agent Coulson?
- Davis.
Preparing for decent.
Inhuman asset will be waiting on the tarmac.
What?
- How's your wife, Davis?
- Getting bigger every day.
- Oh.
Don't tell her that.
- More beautiful every day.
There you go.
Mack.
Yo-Yo.
- Just have a few questions.
- I'm all yours.
Uh, so, I see you went to Colombia for a week.
Mm-hmm.
Mm.
And, uh, tickets to Miami coming up.
Yes.
Do you watch me sleep or shower or...?
Just procedure.
You don't have to use a satellite to get to know me better.
Just ask me to dinner again.
You know the rules about fraternizing with assets in the field.
Oh, we haven't fraternized anything yet.
And I thought you were breaking the rules, coming to do my checkup early just to see me.
Or are you here because, uh, there's been a lot of little earthquakes lately?
Daisy could be in the area.
But officially, that's not the mission.
Doesn't matter.
We'll never find her.
She's always one step ahead.
What is the official mission?
Can I help?
Here's where I have to remind you that Sokovia Accords,
- which you signed...
- Oh, all right.
...require approval by the United Nations subcommittee...
- before an enhanced indiv...
- Rules, rules, rules.
Blah, blah, blah.
S.H.I.E.L.D. moves too slow now, Turtleman.
- I prefer to move fast.
- Uh...
Mack, they found the truck.
Good to see you, too, Coulson!
Well, if you're in Miami, look me up.
Just because we can't work together doesn't mean we can't live a little.
Hey, just in time.
They've just taken to the pitch.
Where's Jemma?
Is she not coming?
Yeah, she wanted to.
Same story.
All work and no play, huh?
That's a bit disappointing.
Still, make yourself comfortable.
I'm just, uh, finishing cleaning up.
Yeah, should be pretty lopsided, don't you think?
Their keeper's absolutely crap...
Oh, my gosh!
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I had no idea there was somebody here.
Hello.
You...
You weren't meant to see that.
Hello.
I'm glad to final...
- Hello.
I'm glad to final...
- Fitz, meet Aida.
- Hello.
I'm glad to final...
- She's, uh, crashed.
Hello.
I'm glad to final...
Hello.
I'm glad to final...
Hello.
I'm glad to final...
Hello.
I'm glad to final...
Hello.
I'm glad to final...
Hello.
I'm glad to final...
- What the hell?
- Well, I've just upped her PSU to compensate for image processing.
Must have overcranked it.
I'll reboot.
Unh-unh, that's not what I meant.
I meant...
- ...what the hell?
!
- Well, you've already met Aida, digital personal assistant, as a voice on the computer.
So, uh...
- I built her a body.
- Yeah, a naked body.
I-I was just now installing new hardware, updating her gyroscopic sensors.
I'm not some sicko.
When did you build this?
Have you forgotten the very strict stipulations that came with your pardon?
You are not allowed experimentation
- without approval and oversight!
- Oversight, I know.
I'm well aware of that, yeah.
That's why I wanted Simmons here.
I wanted to show both of you.
Look.
This has been a lifelong dream of mine, Fitz.
When I saw the work you and Simmons were doing in replicating human tissue and internal bone structure in Coulson's hand, I knew...
I knew right then that this was within reach.
- A robot?
- Not just a robot.
It's one that can cross the uncanny valley and come out the other side...
pass for a human.
I mean, it has bloody micro-expressions.
She.
It's a...
It's definitely a "she" 'cause I saw...
- Yes...
- She has micro-expressions, full range of motion.
I mean, physically, it's...
- she's nearly perfect.
- She is very realistic.
Now, mentally, well, you've spoken with Aida.
She's bright, she laughs at the jokes
I programmed her to recognize, but she's never pass the Turing test.
At the moment, that's a pipe dream.
However, I think, with your help...
No, no.
No, no, no, no!
We have to report this right away.
- You could lose everything.
- I know.
- Or you could go to jail.
- I know!
I know, you're right.
Full disclosure at this time is the best course of action.
I...
I agree.
Hmm.
At least let me show you how it works.
They're in town.
I supposed you guessed that, texting me.
They're looking for a truck.
That mean you have something for me?
They watch my every move, but certain moves they can't see.
You can't get these over the counter.
S.H.I.E.L.D. issue for rapid bone healing, yes?
I know you splintered your bones when you first powered up.
- Are you pushing yourself too hard?
- Don't worry about me.
You can't use your powers too much.
- Your body will break down.
- I'm fine.
I'm surprised you're still in town.
You're usually moving and moving.
Are you, uh, still hunting those perros rabiosos?
It's not just the Watchdogs now.
Local gangs have been working for them, which I... don't understand.
I was tracing the sale of a weapon, and I...
I think I may have stumbled upon a serial killer.
Ooh.
Fun.
He live around here?
He mostly hits this area, but he's hard to track down, leaves no traces behind, operates alone.
Sound familiar?
I thought maybe you were, uh, growing roots, they say.
- L.A. used to be where you hang out, no?
- No roots.
Everyone gets attached to something eventually.
Don't forget to wait two stops after I get off.
Yeah, yeah.
Hey.
Send me a picture of this guy.
Maybe I can cover some ground if I know what he looks like.
No, I still haven't gotten a good look at him yet, so just...
take care of yourself, okay?
But thank you for the S.H.I.E.L.D. intel.
They won't give up on you, especially Coulson.
All he wants is to find you.
Well, that's too bad, 'cause there's only one thing I want.
Oh, yeah?
What's that?
Nothing to lose.
Here's the Mapping-Action Eyewear you requested.
Should help your team in case of a blind takedown.
- Great.
Thanks.
- I need you to sign for it.
I don't get the new color-coded security-level rainbow of...
- What's it called?
- The "Spectrum of Security."
Why do I, level red, have to go through you, level orange, to request hardware?
Shouldn't red be higher than orange?
Well, orange encompasses both red and yellow, so...
It's hard to explain, but the Director didn't want to use numbers because he didn't want any team member to feel less than.
Well, you do have a higher clearance than me.
Only in most instances.
I feel less than.
Hey, we just had a report come in.
A death in a hospital in Los Angeles.
Suspicious circumstances.
Suspect is an Asian female.
You think it might be Daisy.
I'm going to look into it.
I just wondered if you'd heard anything from your law-enforcement contacts?
I'm mostly in the dark these days.
Why don't you ask the Director?
Since you're one of the few people allowed or willing to do that.
What you got there?
Didn't hear?
Word is, he hit again last night.
- Two dead in the street.
- Who?
Ghost Rider.
You must not be from around here.
Do you know where I can find him?
Nobody does.
Everybody that sees his face ends up on this wall.
"Everyone gets attached to something."
We got to get this truck out of here.
What are you, the Feds?
Something like that.
We'll be sealing the scene.
Not for long, I hope.
I was just gonna have this guy tow this thing away so me and my crew can get back to work.
We got this.
This warehouse usually sits empty.
We were gonna store some inventory today.
Found the lock broken and this big, honkin' thing inside.
- Have at it.
- Thank you.
Not fair.
You want tech like this, you should've cut off your own hand.
Mack.
Okay.
Looks like these guys tore each other apart.
Zhang Wei, resident of Monterey Park.
Organ donor.
Say anything about him being a flesh-hungry rage monster?
Uh, no, I'm not seeing anything about that here, so we have to assume that he wasn't until he came in contact with whatever's in that trailer.
Not much here that'll lead us anywhere.
Well... there's that.
There was no buyer there.
No, no, no.
No!
Please, God, no!
No!
I don't deserve to die!
- No!
No!
- Everyone says that.
No!
No!
No!
Yeah, those chargers are hard to find.
Between "Fast and Furious" and "Dukes of Hazzard,"
they wrecked a lot of them.
My boyfriend wrecked his in a street race.
He's pretty broken up.
I guess he was more attached to it than I thought.
I ain't seen none around here, though.
- Sorry.
- All right.
Thanks, man.
Hey, uh, most of them wrecked movie cars, they're dumped at El Monte Junk and Salvage.
If your boyfriend wants to fix his ride up, might want to go over there and find scraps.
Thanks.
Maybe he'll go there.
Daisy's in Los Angeles.
There was an eyewitness, now dead, and I just received Yo-Yo's check-in report a week early, which means Coulson and Mack are there, too,
- no doubt, trying to track Daisy down.
- Sounds right.
You know it is, because according to the logs, you called Coulson back to H.Q. for resupply yourself.
Why, if not to give him that intel in person, knowing it's against the Director's orders?
I didn't send them.
I don't have the authority.
- They acted on their own.
- You knew I'd find out.
Why not tell me?
I have daily lie detection.
- That's why.
- And now I have to report it, which means now I either look like I'm incompetent
- or colluding with you.
- Wouldn't want you falling out of favor with the director.
Okay.
I get it.
It's abundantly clear you're uncomfortable with my new position...
I just want to know how comfortable you are with it.
You actually trust this guy?
Our team split up to lead departments, given different colors.
'Cause we're experts?
No.
I think the Director broke up the band on purpose.
Of course he did!
As soon as Talbot gave the location of this base to the president, things changed.
I knew we'd be divided, undermined, kept in the dark, so I have been clawing for as much power as I can possibly grab to keep a modicum of control over any of this.
After all we've been through...
I don't trust the new Director, but he trusts me, so now, in order to keep that trust,
I must take the appropriate action to address this break in protocol.
I'm sending you and your strike team to take Coulson and Mack out of the field, by force, if necessary.
Clean up whatever mess he's in.
- That's an order.
- Yes, ma'am.
Place them at the four corners of the exterior of the building.
That'll give us visuals through the walls.
This could be very dangerous.
- So much could go wrong.
- Ultron, yes.
I know.
But this is not A.I. A.I. is banned, and that's good.
This is mimicry of human behavior.
Still, in the wrong hands, this could be used as a weapon.
- Is that the idea?
- No, absolutely not.
No...
Look, I know the dangers.
That's why I've been...
I've been reticent to divulge.
I don't know these new people at S.H.I.E.L.D.
But a weapon is absolutely not the idea.
Well, then, why?
What's she for?
Why not let Aida tell you herself?
Hello.
I'm glad to finally shake your hand, Leopold.
Where's Jemma?
We were hoping that she would come.
S-She's, uh...
indisposed, I'm afraid.
Aida...
- I was wondering...
- Yes, Agent Fitz?
I was wondering if you could tell me exactly what it is you are designed for.
Of course.
Dr. Radcliffe, time and again, has expressed his deep regret for causing pain when all he ever wanted was to prevent it.
He speaks often of the pain that you and Agent Simmons have had to suffer, having lost so many friends...
Lincoln Campbell,
Andrew Garner, Antoine Triplett...
Okay, stop it, stop.
You don't have to list them.
Sorry.
The hope is that I will be able to prevent future tragedies... save the lives of agents by putting myself in harm's way in their place.
- To kill?
- No.
I am incapable of that.
I will protect.
I will serve as a decoy target, a safeguard...
- ...a shield.
- Okay.
T-Turn her off.
We can't tell Simmons about this.
What?
Don't we want to move forward?
Her approval is...
This is too dangerous to show the new Director.
We don't know what he'd do with it.
And she would have to tell him, so... she can't know.
- Not until...
- Until...?
Until she's perfect.
They're walking in now, six.
Really convivial-looking fellows.
At least four of them are packing.
We should be tapped into surveillance now.
Let's see what we get.
Where are the other two men?
We had to leave them at the pick-up site.
Explain.
Those guys were transferring the box into the armored transport.
Maybe they peeked inside or something.
But they went berserk and tore into each other.
There was blood everywhere.
We put two bullets in each of them and locked them in the truck.
No, no.
Look, we were freaking out.
We had to get out of there!
Did you burn their bodies or dump the truck in the ocean?
Because if not, they can be traced back here.
They probably saw what was in this box and were fighting over it, you idiot!
I have been told it's powerful enough to bring our new enhanced enemies to their knees.
We get on comms and call the Zephyr for backup, headquarters will know we're on Daisy's trail.
No orders to pull out.
She's been tracking this sale.
- She could show up here any minute.
- I don't know.
Let's let this play out, see if anyone else makes an appearance.
Excuse me.
Uh, the yard's closing.
To sell a junker, you can call the number on the gate.
Oh, no, I'm not here for that.
I, uh...
Uh, sorry.
What's your name?
Robbie.
Well, Robbie, I am looking for a guy with a sweet black '69 Charger.
Maybe he bought some parts here.
Sorry.
Doesn't ring a bell.
I only work nights once a week.
Uh, well, maybe I'll...
I'll come back in the morning.
Thank you.
Or...
there's a book of sales you can flip through in the main office.
Not really an office.
More of a trailer, but I can show you.
That would be great, thank you.
The hell...?
What was that?
A breath of fresh air.
Get away from me!
That's it there.
- So, you live around here?
- No, I used to.
I'm just in town for a couple days, soaking up the sun.
Strange place to spend your vacation.
Not a great neighborhood.
So... you've got the devil inside you, too.
What's going on, guys?
Call for backup, yeah?
We can't wait for Daisy.
These guys might kill somebody besides each other.
Yeah.
Us.
Z One, we got a situation.
We need a little help here.
That was efficient.
You guys know what to do.
Damn.
All clear.
You shouldn't have gotten involved.
Serial killers always complain when we try to intervene.
I only kill asesinos who deserve it.
It's vengeance, chica.
For what?
You killed a detective.
But he had blood on his hands.
- A teacher!
- A pedophile.
You don't get to decide who deserves to die.
I'm not the one who decides.
Do it.
I deserve it.
Do it.
Hey.
Thank for the ride, Janet.
You never accept rides.
Bus break down?
Or you still trying to holler at Janet's little sister?
Maybe.
I only needed a ride to help Canelo balance some books because my brother didn't finish high school.
Yo, I finished high school...
in the 11th grade.
"Everyone's attached to something."
We'll return in a moment.
- Spent a lot of time in here?
- Too much.
My wallet's starting to get sick of it.
Your little side mission didn't go unnoticed.
Well, you showed up, so, yeah.
The Director will want to have words with you at H.Q.
- No Daisy, huh?
- No.
But she was tracking these guys, so maybe this is a win.
I don't know.
The ground team is checking for contagion, but hopefully, whatever messed with these guys' heads is no longer an issue.
We're gonna analyze the box it came in.
It's good...
to have a moment, just us.
It's been a long time since we had a moment alone.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
Just a long day.
Well, take advantage of the down time.
Who knows what tomorrow holds?
[Music] [Car engine revving]
[Gun cocks]
[Tires screeching, horn honks]
[Grunts] It's coming!
Get ready!
[Tires screeching] Go, man, go!
Aah!
Man:
Damn it!
Damn it!
Engine's dead!
[Tires screech]
Get it.
Kill it!
Shoot anything that moves.
[Breathing shakily]
[Rustling] [Firing]
Help.
He...
He got me.
He'll kill us all.
Give me that damn thing.
Get back!

Shoot it!
Shoot it now!

4x01 - "The Ghost"
You need to sacrifice everything if you want to survive.
Hmm.
That's funny.
'Cause I thought I would just...
Mm.
Yeah, that's one way to go. [Sighs]
[Chuckles] Want a beer?
It's 6:00 in the morning.
What, are you Hemingway?
No, is that real?
When did we cross the North Pole?
An hour ago.
Oh, my gosh.
It's hard to keep track in this thing.
We shouldn't have to stay on clock when we're moving through time zones.
I mean, what is that...
three continents in two days?
If you count Berlin.
We were only there three hours.
Yeah, we knew that Inhuman call was a hoax as soon as we stepped foot in the apartment, saw that bong.
- I could smell it from the hallway.
- Jokers.
Hungry for attention.
And potato chips.
If the munchies was a superpower, they'd be signing the Sokovia Accords as we speak.
[Breathes deeply]
You should let me work on Lola.
I warned you.
Everything in Lola is custom.
Yeah, yeah, everything is custom.
But it would be something to do.
There's only so many times a guy can win cash off you... sir.
You got to stop calling me that.
- We're being called back to H.Q.
- They say why?
We're not due for a restock for another 10 days.
- No idea.
They said it's classified.
- Oh, everything is nowadays.
[Breathes deeply] All right, we'll need full inventory.
Medical, provisions, fuel cells, and make sure you tell the crew they'll need to call ahead if they want off our next deployment.
Agent Thompson...
- Wonder what that's about.
- Oh, I don't know.
- It'll be good to see Fitz and Simmons.
- And May.
Yeah...
I think you look forward to that more than I do.
Hyah!
What was his mistake?
[Music]
You know I'm not gonna talk.
He didn't anticipate your back kick.
Opened himself up.
His mistake was he tapped out.
[Motor whirring]
- Piper.
- Okay, people!
What, you never seen the biggest plane ever built before?
!
Next pairing, on the mat!
- How long has it been?
- Six weeks in the air.
Only the Quinjet touched down.
- Is that a record for Zephyr One?
- It is.
It was supposed to be even longer.
- You know who called us in?
- I do.
You?
Okay.
Now I know something's up.
I got word from contacts in law enforcement, Los Angeles.
Two civilians were violently killed.
Mack:
Mysterious burns, heads bashed in, spine pulled out of his...
Wow.
Many conflicting accounts, but all agree... it was odd.
Odd?
Isn't that our wheelhouse?
He's right.
Why call us in?
We could be headed to the scene right now to confirm the presence of an enhanced person,
- if there is one.
- If it checks out, we bag and tag.
We handle these on the fly.
Didn't exactly want to send this out on the wire.
May, you're not sharing again.
Now would be a really good time to share.
The police also have another victim in custody.
Critical condition.
Under sedation, he mentioned seeing a girl, saying it was the one from the news.
Quake.
Which you didn't want to send over the wire.
You were pulled off Daisy's case.
The Director thinks she slipped through our fingers too many times.
The Director thinks you let her.
No, we pursued her.
She was a ghost.
Well, in his infinite wisdom, he says you're now forbidden to.
But you're telling us this because...?
In case we want to do something about it.
Look, I can bury this until the official police report comes through.
That'll buy us a few hours lead time.
Get to L.A., sniff around.
Yeah.
We have an active Inhuman asset in Los Angeles that's due for a check-in soon enough.
It'll justify our presence there, but as soon as the report's filed, they'll pull us out.
And the armed forces will be sent in after her.
With orders to kill.
- To kill?
- If she's responsible for these bodies.
- That's not Daisy's M.O.
- The world knows her as Quake, and Quake is an outlaw who takes down banks and bridges.
- Oh, come on.
We both know
- She's hunting violent radicals.
She's tracking these fanatics, the Watchdogs, trying to take down their funding, their... their escape routes.
Regardless, you should fuel up and get back up in the air ASAP.
Find her before the military does something bad.
Or Daisy does something worse.
[Monitors beeping]
Man:
Hey.
You can't be here.
Stop right there.
[Rumbling] [Screams]
How are we feeling today?
[Rumbling]
I've been tracking weapon sales, and I know you were hired to steal one.
You even jacked a big rig to help carry it out.
We were just paid for a smash-and-grab job.
Who was that hunting you?
[Grunts] Man:
Open the door!
He nailed me, but we almost got away.
Who was it?
- Did he kill my friends?
- All but one.
But you're gonna have to give me a little bit more if I'm gonna find him alive.
[Shuddered breathing]
Save him, please, before he gets burned, too.
You'll see your buddy again once you heal up.
- Just tell me what's...
- [Grunting] No.
No.
It's too late for me.
They say when the Rider burns you [breathing heavily] he burns your soul.
[Grunting]
And a soul can never heal.
[Grunting]
[Indistinct shouting]
[Rumbling]
Man:
Stop right there!
[Echoing] Hello?
Hello?
I hear my voice echo, but it sounds strange in my head.
The detail is amazing.
However, I am 3 feet off the ground.
Fitz:
Wait.
What?
Hold on.
Damn it.
Uh, well, I did adjust the Y axis earlier for some reason.
- What does that look like now?
- Better.
The CPU seems to be handling the high poly count.
Textures are impeccable.
We should build a place to get away... a meadow or a cottage somewhere.
[Sighs] I wish it were ever this quiet.
[Monitors beeping]
Direct-current stimulation.
Creates the other senses like touch and taste but also takes feedback.
So I've just mapped your brain's response...
Response to the environment.
Of course.
Dr. Radcliffe came up with the architecture?
Yeah.
Yeah, he calls it "The Framework."
But all the transcranial apparatus, that's all me.
No.
Of course, you're brilliant, too.
Of course.
'Cause soon you won't even need the eyewear or the earwear, 'cause it'll all be inside your head.
So May's strike team will be able to train virtually instead of May constantly breaking their ribs.
Nathanson:
Hey, hey.
Authorized personnel only, pal.
No pass, no entry.
- Who the hell are you?
- Leave them be, Nathanson.
They have more reason to be here than you do.
Wow.
A lot of new faces.
Good to see yours.
Six weeks.
That's a record.
- Heard you got a promotion.
- Oh, yeah, and a title.
Yeah, Special Advisor to the Director in Science and Technology.
Or "SADIST."
- They keeping you busy?
- With busywork, mostly.
Yeah, and random state-of-the-art lie-detector tests.
So that's the cost of being in the Director's inner circle.
Yeah, he's paranoid about what happened the last time S.H.I.E.L.D. was government-run.
Calls it his Widespread Infiltration Monitoring Program.
Or "WIMP." Hey, uh, you should join us 'cause we're gonna go to Radcliffe's and watch the
Aberdeen-Inverness Caley Thistle League cup final.
They're...
Those are football teams.
I'm not sure they are, Turbo.
Unfortunately, we have to be wheels-up in 10 minutes, so...
Okay.
All right.
Well, strictly business, then.
Aw, yeah.
New toys?
The exploding pen that you asked for.
I can't imagine a use for it.
You never wanted one?
[Chuckles]
And for you, Direct... uh, Agent Coulson with new bells and whistles.
And the directions will be there when you boot it up.
What's, uh...
What's the assignment?
[Sighs]
- It's classified.
- Right.
Everything is these days.
- Fitz, sadly, um...
- Yeah, you can't make the match, either.
- I have to finish my reports.
- Yeah, no, I get it.
That's okay.
Just a shame we hardly get to see each other.
- Any of us.
- [Sighs] Yes, well...
At least it's better than the friends we'll never see again.
[Sighs]
[Laptop beeps] [Music]
_
_ [Door closes]
[Breathing shakily]
We just stole a box.
I don't even know what was inside of it.
We...
We loaded it onto an 18-wheeler, we parked it in a warehouse, and we just left it.
Man:
Left it for who?
[Groans] The Chinatown Crew.
They set the job up and were willing to pay big.
[Grunts, groans]
Lies.
Aryan Brotherhood working with the Chinese?
I swear!
I swear that's all I know.
Where's this warehouse?
I...
I can't tell you that, man.
My people are gonna be mowed down in the payback... the ones you didn't already kill.
If you don't tell me, you'll have to tell him.
Coulson:
This guy's missing.
The rest are dead.
Aryan Brotherhood.
They're not my kind of brothers.
They've been know to work for cash.
Burglary, assault... sort of the value meal of hired guns.
They're suspected in the recent theft of this big rig.
- Probably prepping for a larger score.
- Big, yellow, hard to hide.
So, what, are we looking for this thing?
And if Daisy's chasing the same angle, maybe we get to the finish line first.
I'll greet her when she arrives.
- Davis:
Agent Coulson?
- Davis.
Preparing for decent.
Inhuman asset will be waiting on the tarmac.
[Tablet beeping]
What?
[Music]
- How's your wife, Davis?
- Getting bigger every day.
- Oh.
Don't tell her that.
- More beautiful every day.
[Chuckles]
There you go.
Mack.
Mack:
Yo-Yo.
[Sighs]
- Just have a few questions.
- I'm all yours.
Uh, so, I see you went to Colombia for a week.
Mm-hmm.
Mm.
And, uh, tickets to Miami coming up.
Yes.
Do you watch me sleep or shower or...?
Just procedure.
You don't have to use a satellite to get to know me better.
Just ask me to dinner again.
You know the rules about fraternizing with assets in the field. [Chuckles]
Oh, we haven't fraternized anything yet.
And I thought you were breaking the rules, coming to do my checkup early just to see me.
Or are you here because, uh, there's been a lot of little earthquakes lately?
Daisy could be in the area.
But officially, that's not the mission.
Doesn't matter.
We'll never find her.
She's always one step ahead.
What is the official mission?
Can I help?
Here's where I have to remind you that Sokovia Accords,
- which you signed...
- Oh, all right.
...require approval by the United Nations subcommittee...
- before an enhanced indiv...
- Rules, rules, rules.
Blah, blah, blah.
S.H.I.E.L.D. moves too slow now, Turtleman.
- I prefer to move fast.
- Uh...
Mack, they found the truck.
Good to see you, too, Coulson!
Well, if you're in Miami, look me up.
Just because we can't work together doesn't mean we can't live a little.
[Sighs]
[Crowd cheering on television]
[Doorbell rings]
Hey, just in time.
They've just taken to the pitch.
Where's Jemma?
Is she not coming?
Yeah, she wanted to.
Same story.
All work and no play, huh?
That's a bit disappointing.
Still, make yourself comfortable.
I'm just, uh, finishing cleaning up.
[Music]
Yeah, should be pretty lopsided, don't you think?
Their keeper's absolutely crap...
Oh, my gosh!
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I had no idea there was somebody here.
Hello.
[Sighs] You...
You weren't meant to see that.
Hello.
I'm glad to final...
- Hello.
I'm glad to final...
- Fitz, meet Aida.
- Hello.
I'm glad to final...
- She's, uh, crashed.
Hello.
I'm glad to final...
Hello.
I'm glad to final...
Hello.
I'm glad to final...
Hello.
I'm glad to final...
Hello.
I'm glad to final...
Hello.
I'm glad to final...
[Powers down]
[Remote beeping]
- What the hell?
- Well, I've just upped her PSU to compensate for image processing.
Must have overcranked it.
I'll reboot.
Unh-unh, that's not what I meant.
I meant...
- ...what the hell?
!
- Well, you've already met Aida, digital personal assistant, as a voice on the computer.
So, uh...
- I built her a body.
- Yeah, a naked body.
I-I was just now installing new hardware, updating her gyroscopic sensors.
I'm not some sicko.
When did you build this?
Have you forgotten the very strict stipulations that came with your pardon?
You are not allowed experimentation
- without approval and oversight!
- Oversight, I know.
I'm well aware of that, yeah.
That's why I wanted Simmons here.
I wanted to show both of you.
Look.
This has been a lifelong dream of mine, Fitz.
When I saw the work you and Simmons were doing in replicating human tissue and internal bone structure in Coulson's hand, I knew...
I knew right then that this was within reach.
- A robot?
- Not just a robot.
It's one that can cross the uncanny valley and come out the other side...
pass for a human.
I mean, it has bloody micro-expressions.
She.
It's a...
It's definitely a "she" 'cause I saw...
- Yes...
- She has micro-expressions, full range of motion.
I mean, physically, it's...
- she's nearly perfect.
- She is very realistic.
[Music]
Now, mentally, well, you've spoken with Aida.
She's bright, she laughs at the jokes
I programmed her to recognize, but she's never pass the Turing test.
At the moment, that's a pipe dream.
However, I think, with your help...
No, no.
No, no, no, no!
We have to report this right away.
- You could lose everything.
- I know.
- Or you could go to jail.
- I know!
I know, you're right.
Full disclosure at this time is the best course of action.
I...
I agree.
Hmm.
At least let me show you how it works.
[Air brakes hiss]
They're in town.
I supposed you guessed that, texting me.
They're looking for a truck.
That mean you have something for me?
They watch my every move, but certain moves they can't see.
You can't get these over the counter.
S.H.I.E.L.D. issue for rapid bone healing, yes?
I know you splintered your bones when you first powered up.
- Are you pushing yourself too hard?
- Don't worry about me.
You can't use your powers too much.
- Your body will break down.
- I'm fine.
I'm surprised you're still in town.
You're usually moving and moving.
Are you, uh, still hunting those perros rabiosos?
It's not just the Watchdogs now.
Local gangs have been working for them, which I... don't understand.
I was tracing the sale of a weapon, and I...
I think I may have stumbled upon a serial killer.
Ooh.
Fun.
He live around here?
He mostly hits this area, but he's hard to track down, leaves no traces behind, operates alone.
Sound familiar?
I thought maybe you were, uh, growing roots, they say.
- L.A. used to be where you hang out, no?
- No roots.
Everyone gets attached to something eventually.
Don't forget to wait two stops after I get off.
Yeah, yeah.
Hey.
Send me a picture of this guy.
Maybe I can cover some ground if I know what he looks like.
No, I still haven't gotten a good look at him yet, so just...
take care of yourself, okay?
But thank you for the S.H.I.E.L.D. intel.
They won't give up on you, especially Coulson.
All he wants is to find you.
Well, that's too bad, 'cause there's only one thing I want.
Oh, yeah?
What's that?
Nothing to lose.
Here's the Mapping-Action Eyewear you requested.
Should help your team in case of a blind takedown.
- Great.
Thanks.
- I need you to sign for it.
I don't get the new color-coded security-level rainbow of...
- What's it called?
- The "Spectrum of Security."
Why do I, level red, have to go through you, level orange, to request hardware?
Shouldn't red be higher than orange?
Well, orange encompasses both red and yellow, so...
It's hard to explain, but the Director didn't want to use numbers because he didn't want any team member to feel less than.
Well, you do have a higher clearance than me.
Only in most instances.
I feel less than.
Hey, we just had a report come in.
A death in a hospital in Los Angeles.
Suspicious circumstances.
Suspect is an Asian female.
You think it might be Daisy.
I'm going to look into it.
I just wondered if you'd heard anything from your law-enforcement contacts?
I'm mostly in the dark these days.
Why don't you ask the Director?
Since you're one of the few people allowed or willing to do that.
[Spray-pain can rattles]
What you got there?
Didn't hear?
Word is, he hit again last night.
- Two dead in the street.
- Who?
Ghost Rider.
You must not be from around here.
Do you know where I can find him?
Nobody does.
Everybody that sees his face ends up on this wall.
"Everyone gets attached to something."
[Engine revs, tires screech]
Man:
We got to get this truck out of here.
What are you, the Feds?
Something like that.
We'll be sealing the scene.
Not for long, I hope.
I was just gonna have this guy tow this thing away so me and my crew can get back to work.
We got this.
Man:
This warehouse usually sits empty.
We were gonna store some inventory today.
Found the lock broken and this big, honkin' thing inside.
- Have at it.
- Coulson:
Thank you.
[Wrist beeps]
[Music]
Not fair.
You want tech like this, you should've cut off your own hand.
Mack.
Okay.
Mack:
Looks like these guys tore each other apart.
Zhang Wei, resident of Monterey Park.
Organ donor.
Say anything about him being a flesh-hungry rage monster?
Uh, no, I'm not seeing anything about that here, so we have to assume that he wasn't until he came in contact with whatever's in that trailer.
Not much here that'll lead us anywhere.
Well... there's that.
[Door slams]
[Keys rattling]
There was no buyer there.
[Car door closes]
[Engine starts, revs]
No, no, no.
No!
Please, God, no!
No!
I don't deserve to die!
- No!
No!
- Everyone says that.
No!
No!
No!
Diego:
Yeah, those chargers are hard to find.
Between "Fast and Furious" and "Dukes of Hazzard,"
they wrecked a lot of them.
My boyfriend wrecked his in a street race.
He's pretty broken up.
I guess he was more attached to it than I thought.
I ain't seen none around here, though.
- Sorry.
- All right.
Thanks, man.
Hey, uh, most of them wrecked movie cars, they're dumped at El Monte Junk and Salvage.
If your boyfriend wants to fix his ride up, might want to go over there and find scraps.
Thanks.
Maybe he'll go there.
Simmons:
Daisy's in Los Angeles.
There was an eyewitness, now dead, and I just received Yo-Yo's check-in report a week early, which means Coulson and Mack are there, too,
- no doubt, trying to track Daisy down.
- Sounds right.
You know it is, because according to the logs, you called Coulson back to H.Q. for resupply yourself.
Why, if not to give him that intel in person, knowing it's against the Director's orders?
I didn't send them.
I don't have the authority.
- They acted on their own.
- You knew I'd find out.
Why not tell me?
I have daily lie detection.
- That's why.
- And now I have to report it, which means now I either look like I'm incompetent
- or colluding with you.
- Wouldn't want you falling out of favor with the director.
[Sighs]
Okay.
I get it.
It's abundantly clear you're uncomfortable with my new position...
I just want to know how comfortable you are with it.
You actually trust this guy?
Our team split up to lead departments, given different colors.
'Cause we're experts?
No.
I think the Director broke up the band on purpose.
Of course he did!
[Sighs]
As soon as Talbot gave the location of this base to the president, things changed.
I knew we'd be divided, undermined, kept in the dark, so I have been clawing for as much power as I can possibly grab to keep a modicum of control over any of this.
After all we've been through...
[Sighs]
I don't trust the new Director, but he trusts me, so now, in order to keep that trust,
I must take the appropriate action to address this break in protocol.
I'm sending you and your strike team to take Coulson and Mack out of the field, by force, if necessary.
Clean up whatever mess he's in.
- That's an order.
- Yes, ma'am.
Mack:
Place them at the four corners of the exterior of the building.
That'll give us visuals through the walls.
Fitz:
This could be very dangerous.
- So much could go wrong.
- Ultron, yes.
I know.
But this is not A.I. A.I. is banned, and that's good.
This is mimicry of human behavior.
Still, in the wrong hands, this could be used as a weapon.
- Is that the idea?
- No, absolutely not.
No...
Look, I know the dangers.
That's why I've been...
I've been reticent to divulge.
I don't know these new people at S.H.I.E.L.D.
But a weapon is absolutely not the idea.
Well, then, why?
What's she for?
Why not let Aida tell you herself?
[Remote beeps] [Silent whir]
[Music]
Hello.
I'm glad to finally shake your hand, Leopold.
Where's Jemma?
We were hoping that she would come.
S-She's, uh...
indisposed, I'm afraid.
Aida...
- I was wondering...
- Yes, Agent Fitz?
[Breathes deeply]
I was wondering if you could tell me exactly what it is you are designed for.
Of course.
Dr. Radcliffe, time and again, has expressed his deep regret for causing pain when all he ever wanted was to prevent it.
He speaks often of the pain that you and Agent Simmons have had to suffer, having lost so many friends...
Lincoln Campbell,
Andrew Garner, Antoine Triplett...
Okay, stop it, stop.
You don't have to list them.
Sorry.
The hope is that I will be able to prevent future tragedies... save the lives of agents by putting myself in harm's way in their place.
- To kill?
- No.
I am incapable of that.
I will protect.
I will serve as a decoy target, a safeguard...
- ...a shield.
- Okay.
T-Turn her off.
[Breathes deeply]
[Remote beeps] [Powers down]
[Sighs]
We can't tell Simmons about this.
What?
Don't we want to move forward?
Her approval is...
This is too dangerous to show the new Director.
We don't know what he'd do with it.
And she would have to tell him, so... she can't know.
- Not until...
- Until...?
Until she's perfect.
[Music]
[Music]
Coulson:
They're walking in now, six.
Really convivial-looking fellows.
At least four of them are packing.
Mack:
We should be tapped into surveillance now.
Let's see what we get.
[Tablet beeps]
Where are the other two men?
We had to leave them at the pick-up site.
Explain.
Those guys were transferring the box into the armored transport.
Maybe they peeked inside or something.
But they went berserk and tore into each other.
There was blood everywhere.
We put two bullets in each of them and locked them in the truck.
No, no.
Look, we were freaking out.
We had to get out of there!
Did you burn their bodies or dump the truck in the ocean?
Because if not, they can be traced back here.
They probably saw what was in this box and were fighting over it, you idiot!
I have been told it's powerful enough to bring our new enhanced enemies to their knees.
We get on comms and call the Zephyr for backup, headquarters will know we're on Daisy's trail.
No orders to pull out.
She's been tracking this sale.
- She could show up here any minute.
- I don't know.
Let's let this play out, see if anyone else makes an appearance.
[Music]
Daisy:
Excuse me.
Uh, the yard's closing.
To sell a junker, you can call the number on the gate.
Oh, no, I'm not here for that.
I, uh...
Uh, sorry.
What's your name?
Robbie.
Well, Robbie, I am looking for a guy with a sweet black '69 Charger.
Maybe he bought some parts here.
Sorry.
Doesn't ring a bell.
I only work nights once a week.
Uh, well, maybe I'll...
I'll come back in the morning.
Thank you.
Or...
there's a book of sales you can flip through in the main office.
Not really an office.
More of a trailer, but I can show you.
That would be great, thank you.
[Men gasping]
[Tablet whirs] The hell...?
What was that?
A breath of fresh air.
[Ghostly shriek] [Gasps]
[Men grunting]
Get away from me!
That's it there.
- So, you live around here?
- No, I used to.
I'm just in town for a couple days, soaking up the sun.
Strange place to spend your vacation.
[Keys rattling]
Not a great neighborhood.
[Rumbling]
[Breathing heavily]
So... you've got the devil inside you, too.
What's going on, guys?
[Tablet whirs]
Call for backup, yeah?
We can't wait for Daisy.
These guys might kill somebody besides each other.
Yeah.
Us.
Z One, we got a situation.
We need a little help here.
[Gunshot]
That was efficient.
[Tablet beeps]
[Goggles beep, whir]
[Goggles beeping, whirring]
You guys know what to do.
[Music]
Damn.
May:
All clear.
[Fighting sounds] [Music]
[Rumbling]
You shouldn't have gotten involved.
Serial killers always complain when we try to intervene.
I only kill asesinos who deserve it.
It's vengeance, chica.
For what?
You killed a detective.
But he had blood on his hands.
- A teacher!
- A pedophile.
[Rumbling]
You don't get to decide who deserves to die.
I'm not the one who decides.
[Grunts]
[Music]
[Rumbling]
[Rumbling]
[Panting]
Do it. [Panting] I deserve it.
Do it.
[Grunts]
[Engine starts]
[Tires screech]
[Grunts]
[Brakes squeak]
[Music]
[Music stops]
Hey.
Thank for the ride, Janet.
You never accept rides.
Bus break down?
Or you still trying to holler at Janet's little sister?
Maybe.
I only needed a ride to help Canelo balance some books because my brother didn't finish high school.
Yo, I finished high school...
in the 11th grade.
[Chuckles]
"Everyone's attached to something."
[Engine starts]
[Indistinct conversations]
- Spent a lot of time in here?
- Too much.
My wallet's starting to get sick of it.
Your little side mission didn't go unnoticed.
Well, you showed up, so, yeah.
The Director will want to have words with you at H.Q.
[Chuckles]
[Sighs]
- No Daisy, huh?
- No.
But she was tracking these guys, so maybe this is a win.
I don't know.
The ground team is checking for contagion, but hopefully, whatever messed with these guys' heads is no longer an issue.
We're gonna analyze the box it came in.
It's good...
to have a moment, just us.
It's been a long time since we had a moment alone.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
Just a long day.
Well, take advantage of the down time.
Who knows what tomorrow holds?
[Music] [Car engine revving]
[Gun cocks]
[Tires screeching, horn honks]
[Grunts] It's coming!
Get ready!
[Tires screeching] Go, man, go!
Aah!
Man:
Damn it!
Damn it!
Engine's dead!
[Tires screech]
Get it.
Kill it!
Shoot anything that moves.
[Breathing shakily]
[Rustling] [Firing]
Help.
He...
He got me.
He'll kill us all.
Give me that damn thing.
Get back!
[Gunfire, woman screaming]
[Engine revving in distance]
[Music]
[Tires screeching]
Man:
Shoot it!
Shoot it now!
[Gunfire]
[Screams]
[Panting]
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No, please!
No!
[Screams]
[Tires screeching]
[Sirens wail]
[Rumbling]
4x01 - "The Ghost"
You need to sacrifice everything if you want to survive.
Hmm.
That's funny.
'Cause I thought I would just...
Mm.
Yeah, that's one way to go. [Sighs]
[Chuckles] Want a beer?
It's 6:00 in the morning.
What, are you Hemingway?
No, is that real?
When did we cross the North Pole?
An hour ago.
Oh, my gosh.
It's hard to keep track in this thing.
We shouldn't have to stay on clock when we're moving through time zones.
I mean, what is that...
three continents in two days?
If you count Berlin.
We were only there three hours.
Yeah, we knew that Inhuman call was a hoax as soon as we stepped foot in the apartment, saw that bong.
- I could smell it from the hallway.
- Jokers.
Hungry for attention.
And potato chips.
If the munchies was a superpower, they'd be signing the Sokovia Accords as we speak.
[Breathes deeply]
You should let me work on Lola.
I warned you.
Everything in Lola is custom.
Yeah, yeah, everything is custom.
But it would be something to do.
There's only so many times a guy can win cash off you... sir.
You got to stop calling me that.
- We're being called back to H.Q.
- They say why?
We're not due for a restock for another 10 days.
- No idea.
They said it's classified.
- Oh, everything is nowadays.
[Breathes deeply] All right, we'll need full inventory.
Medical, provisions, fuel cells, and make sure you tell the crew they'll need to call ahead if they want off our next deployment.
Agent Thompson...
- Wonder what that's about.
- Oh, I don't know.
- It'll be good to see Fitz and Simmons.
- And May.
Yeah...
I think you look forward to that more than I do.
Hyah!
What was his mistake?
[Music]
You know I'm not gonna talk.
He didn't anticipate your back kick.
Opened himself up.
His mistake was he tapped out.
[Motor whirring]
- Piper.
- Okay, people!
What, you never seen the biggest plane ever built before?
!
Next pairing, on the mat!
- How long has it been?
- Six weeks in the air.
Only the Quinjet touched down.
- Is that a record for Zephyr One?
- It is.
It was supposed to be even longer.
- You know who called us in?
- I do.
You?
Okay.
Now I know something's up.
I got word from contacts in law enforcement, Los Angeles.
Two civilians were violently killed.
Mack:
Mysterious burns, heads bashed in, spine pulled out of his...
Wow.
Many conflicting accounts, but all agree... it was odd.
Odd?
Isn't that our wheelhouse?
He's right.
Why call us in?
We could be headed to the scene right now to confirm the presence of an enhanced person,
- if there is one.
- If it checks out, we bag and tag.
We handle these on the fly.
Didn't exactly want to send this out on the wire.
May, you're not sharing again.
Now would be a really good time to share.
The police also have another victim in custody.
Critical condition.
Under sedation, he mentioned seeing a girl, saying it was the one from the news.
Quake.
Which you didn't want to send over the wire.
You were pulled off Daisy's case.
The Director thinks she slipped through our fingers too many times.
The Director thinks you let her.
No, we pursued her.
She was a ghost.
Well, in his infinite wisdom, he says you're now forbidden to.
But you're telling us this because...?
In case we want to do something about it.
Look, I can bury this until the official police report comes through.
That'll buy us a few hours lead time.
Get to L.A., sniff around.
Yeah.
We have an active Inhuman asset in Los Angeles that's due for a check-in soon enough.
It'll justify our presence there, but as soon as the report's filed, they'll pull us out.
And the armed forces will be sent in after her.
With orders to kill.
- To kill?
- If she's responsible for these bodies.
- That's not Daisy's M.O.
- The world knows her as Quake, and Quake is an outlaw who takes down banks and bridges.
- Oh, come on.
We both know
- She's hunting violent radicals.
She's tracking these fanatics, the Watchdogs, trying to take down their funding, their... their escape routes.
Regardless, you should fuel up and get back up in the air ASAP.
Find her before the military does something bad.
Or Daisy does something worse.
[Monitors beeping]
Man:
Hey.
You can't be here.
Stop right there.
[Rumbling] [Screams]
How are we feeling today?
[Rumbling]
I've been tracking weapon sales, and I know you were hired to steal one.
You even jacked a big rig to help carry it out.
We were just paid for a smash-and-grab job.
Who was that hunting you?
[Grunts] Man:
Open the door!
He nailed me, but we almost got away.
Who was it?
- Did he kill my friends?
- All but one.
But you're gonna have to give me a little bit more if I'm gonna find him alive.
[Shuddered breathing]
Save him, please, before he gets burned, too.
You'll see your buddy again once you heal up.
- Just tell me what's...
- [Grunting] No.
No.
It's too late for me.
They say when the Rider burns you [breathing heavily] he burns your soul.
[Grunting]
And a soul can never heal.
[Grunting]
[Indistinct shouting]
[Rumbling]
Man:
Stop right there!
[Echoing] Hello?
Hello?
I hear my voice echo, but it sounds strange in my head.
The detail is amazing.
However, I am 3 feet off the ground.
Fitz:
Wait.
What?
Hold on.
Damn it.
Uh, well, I did adjust the Y axis earlier for some reason.
- What does that look like now?
- Better.
The CPU seems to be handling the high poly count.
Textures are impeccable.
We should build a place to get away... a meadow or a cottage somewhere.
[Sighs] I wish it were ever this quiet.
[Monitors beeping]
Direct-current stimulation.
Creates the other senses like touch and taste but also takes feedback.
So I've just mapped your brain's response...
Response to the environment.
Of course.
Dr. Radcliffe came up with the architecture?
Yeah.
Yeah, he calls it "The Framework."
But all the transcranial apparatus, that's all me.
No.
Of course, you're brilliant, too.
Of course.
'Cause soon you won't even need the eyewear or the earwear, 'cause it'll all be inside your head.
So May's strike team will be able to train virtually instead of May constantly breaking their ribs.
Nathanson:
Hey, hey.
Authorized personnel only, pal.
No pass, no entry.
- Who the hell are you?
- Leave them be, Nathanson.
They have more reason to be here than you do.
Wow.
A lot of new faces.
Good to see yours.
Six weeks.
That's a record.
- Heard you got a promotion.
- Oh, yeah, and a title.
Yeah, Special Advisor to the Director in Science and Technology.
Or "SADIST."
- They keeping you busy?
- With busywork, mostly.
Yeah, and random state-of-the-art lie-detector tests.
So that's the cost of being in the Director's inner circle.
Yeah, he's paranoid about what happened the last time S.H.I.E.L.D. was government-run.
Calls it his Widespread Infiltration Monitoring Program.
Or "WIMP." Hey, uh, you should join us 'cause we're gonna go to Radcliffe's and watch the
Aberdeen-Inverness Caley Thistle League cup final.
They're...
Those are football teams.
I'm not sure they are, Turbo.
Unfortunately, we have to be wheels-up in 10 minutes, so...
Okay.
All right.
Well, strictly business, then.
Aw, yeah.
New toys?
The exploding pen that you asked for.
I can't imagine a use for it.
You never wanted one?
[Chuckles]
And for you, Direct... uh, Agent Coulson with new bells and whistles.
And the directions will be there when you boot it up.
What's, uh...
What's the assignment?
[Sighs]
- It's classified.
- Right.
Everything is these days.
- Fitz, sadly, um...
- Yeah, you can't make the match, either.
- I have to finish my reports.
- Yeah, no, I get it.
That's okay.
Just a shame we hardly get to see each other.
- Any of us.
- [Sighs] Yes, well...
At least it's better than the friends we'll never see again.
[Sighs]
[Laptop beeps] [Music]
_
_ [Door closes]
[Breathing shakily]
We just stole a box.
I don't even know what was inside of it.
We...
We loaded it onto an 18-wheeler, we parked it in a warehouse, and we just left it.
Man:
Left it for who?
[Groans] The Chinatown Crew.
They set the job up and were willing to pay big.
[Grunts, groans]
Lies.
Aryan Brotherhood working with the Chinese?
I swear!
I swear that's all I know.
Where's this warehouse?
I...
I can't tell you that, man.
My people are gonna be mowed down in the payback... the ones you didn't already kill.
If you don't tell me, you'll have to tell him.
Coulson:
This guy's missing.
The rest are dead.
Aryan Brotherhood.
They're not my kind of brothers.
They've been know to work for cash.
Burglary, assault... sort of the value meal of hired guns.
They're suspected in the recent theft of this big rig.
- Probably prepping for a larger score.
- Big, yellow, hard to hide.
So, what, are we looking for this thing?
And if Daisy's chasing the same angle, maybe we get to the finish line first.
I'll greet her when she arrives.
- Davis:
Agent Coulson?
- Davis.
Preparing for decent.
Inhuman asset will be waiting on the tarmac.
[Tablet beeping]
What?
[Music]
- How's your wife, Davis?
- Getting bigger every day.
- Oh.
Don't tell her that.
- More beautiful every day.
[Chuckles]
There you go.
Mack.
Mack:
Yo-Yo.
[Sighs]
- Just have a few questions.
- I'm all yours.
Uh, so, I see you went to Colombia for a week.
Mm-hmm.
Mm.
And, uh, tickets to Miami coming up.
Yes.
Do you watch me sleep or shower or...?
Just procedure.
You don't have to use a satellite to get to know me better.
Just ask me to dinner again.
You know the rules about fraternizing with assets in the field. [Chuckles]
Oh, we haven't fraternized anything yet.
And I thought you were breaking the rules, coming to do my checkup early just to see me.
Or are you here because, uh, there's been a lot of little earthquakes lately?
Daisy could be in the area.
But officially, that's not the mission.
Doesn't matter.
We'll never find her.
She's always one step ahead.
What is the official mission?
Can I help?
Here's where I have to remind you that Sokovia Accords,
- which you signed...
- Oh, all right.
...require approval by the United Nations subcommittee...
- before an enhanced indiv...
- Rules, rules, rules.
Blah, blah, blah.
S.H.I.E.L.D. moves too slow now, Turtleman.
- I prefer to move fast.
- Uh...
Mack, they found the truck.
Good to see you, too, Coulson!
Well, if you're in Miami, look me up.
Just because we can't work together doesn't mean we can't live a little.
[Sighs]
[Crowd cheering on television]
[Doorbell rings]
Hey, just in time.
They've just taken to the pitch.
Where's Jemma?
Is she not coming?
Yeah, she wanted to.
Same story.
All work and no play, huh?
That's a bit disappointing.
Still, make yourself comfortable.
I'm just, uh, finishing cleaning up.
[Music]
Yeah, should be pretty lopsided, don't you think?
Their keeper's absolutely crap...
Oh, my gosh!
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I had no idea there was somebody here.
Hello.
[Sighs] You...
You weren't meant to see that.
Hello.
I'm glad to final...
- Hello.
I'm glad to final...
- Fitz, meet Aida.
- Hello.
I'm glad to final...
- She's, uh, crashed.
Hello.
I'm glad to final...
Hello.
I'm glad to final...
Hello.
I'm glad to final...
Hello.
I'm glad to final...
Hello.
I'm glad to final...
Hello.
I'm glad to final...
[Powers down]
[Remote beeping]
- What the hell?
- Well, I've just upped her PSU to compensate for image processing.
Must have overcranked it.
I'll reboot.
Unh-unh, that's not what I meant.
I meant...
- ...what the hell?
!
- Well, you've already met Aida, digital personal assistant, as a voice on the computer.
So, uh...
- I built her a body.
- Yeah, a naked body.
I-I was just now installing new hardware, updating her gyroscopic sensors.
I'm not some sicko.
When did you build this?
Have you forgotten the very strict stipulations that came with your pardon?
You are not allowed experimentation
- without approval and oversight!
- Oversight, I know.
I'm well aware of that, yeah.
That's why I wanted Simmons here.
I wanted to show both of you.
Look.
This has been a lifelong dream of mine, Fitz.
When I saw the work you and Simmons were doing in replicating human tissue and internal bone structure in Coulson's hand, I knew...
I knew right then that this was within reach.
- A robot?
- Not just a robot.
It's one that can cross the uncanny valley and come out the other side...
pass for a human.
I mean, it has bloody micro-expressions.
She.
It's a...
It's definitely a "she" 'cause I saw...
- Yes...
- She has micro-expressions, full range of motion.
I mean, physically, it's...
- she's nearly perfect.
- She is very realistic.
[Music]
Now, mentally, well, you've spoken with Aida.
She's bright, she laughs at the jokes
I programmed her to recognize, but she's never pass the Turing test.
At the moment, that's a pipe dream.
However, I think, with your help...
No, no.
No, no, no, no!
We have to report this right away.
- You could lose everything.
- I know.
- Or you could go to jail.
- I know!
I know, you're right.
Full disclosure at this time is the best course of action.
I...
I agree.
Hmm.
At least let me show you how it works.
[Air brakes hiss]
They're in town.
I supposed you guessed that, texting me.
They're looking for a truck.
That mean you have something for me?
They watch my every move, but certain moves they can't see.
You can't get these over the counter.
S.H.I.E.L.D. issue for rapid bone healing, yes?
I know you splintered your bones when you first powered up.
- Are you pushing yourself too hard?
- Don't worry about me.
You can't use your powers too much.
- Your body will break down.
- I'm fine.
I'm surprised you're still in town.
You're usually moving and moving.
Are you, uh, still hunting those perros rabiosos?
It's not just the Watchdogs now.
Local gangs have been working for them, which I... don't understand.
I was tracing the sale of a weapon, and I...
I think I may have stumbled upon a serial killer.
Ooh.
Fun.
He live around here?
He mostly hits this area, but he's hard to track down, leaves no traces behind, operates alone.
Sound familiar?
I thought maybe you were, uh, growing roots, they say.
- L.A. used to be where you hang out, no?
- No roots.
Everyone gets attached to something eventually.
Don't forget to wait two stops after I get off.
Yeah, yeah.
Hey.
Send me a picture of this guy.
Maybe I can cover some ground if I know what he looks like.
No, I still haven't gotten a good look at him yet, so just...
take care of yourself, okay?
But thank you for the S.H.I.E.L.D. intel.
They won't give up on you, especially Coulson.
All he wants is to find you.
Well, that's too bad, 'cause there's only one thing I want.
Oh, yeah?
What's that?
Nothing to lose.
Here's the Mapping-Action Eyewear you requested.
Should help your team in case of a blind takedown.
- Great.
Thanks.
- I need you to sign for it.
I don't get the new color-coded security-level rainbow of...
- What's it called?
- The "Spectrum of Security."
Why do I, level red, have to go through you, level orange, to request hardware?
Shouldn't red be higher than orange?
Well, orange encompasses both red and yellow, so...
It's hard to explain, but the Director didn't want to use numbers because he didn't want any team member to feel less than.
Well, you do have a higher clearance than me.
Only in most instances.
I feel less than.
Hey, we just had a report come in.
A death in a hospital in Los Angeles.
Suspicious circumstances.
Suspect is an Asian female.
You think it might be Daisy.
I'm going to look into it.
I just wondered if you'd heard anything from your law-enforcement contacts?
I'm mostly in the dark these days.
Why don't you ask the Director?
Since you're one of the few people allowed or willing to do that.
[Spray-pain can rattles]
What you got there?
Didn't hear?
Word is, he hit again last night.
- Two dead in the street.
- Who?
Ghost Rider.
You must not be from around here.
Do you know where I can find him?
Nobody does.
Everybody that sees his face ends up on this wall.
"Everyone gets attached to something."
[Engine revs, tires screech]
Man:
We got to get this truck out of here.
What are you, the Feds?
Something like that.
We'll be sealing the scene.
Not for long, I hope.
I was just gonna have this guy tow this thing away so me and my crew can get back to work.
We got this.
Man:
This warehouse usually sits empty.
We were gonna store some inventory today.
Found the lock broken and this big, honkin' thing inside.
- Have at it.
- Coulson:
Thank you.
[Wrist beeps]
[Music]
Not fair.
You want tech like this, you should've cut off your own hand.
Mack.
Okay.
Mack:
Looks like these guys tore each other apart.
Zhang Wei, resident of Monterey Park.
Organ donor.
Say anything about him being a flesh-hungry rage monster?
Uh, no, I'm not seeing anything about that here, so we have to assume that he wasn't until he came in contact with whatever's in that trailer.
Not much here that'll lead us anywhere.
Well... there's that.
[Door slams]
[Keys rattling]
There was no buyer there.
[Car door closes]
[Engine starts, revs]
No, no, no.
No!
Please, God, no!
No!
I don't deserve to die!
- No!
No!
- Everyone says that.
No!
No!
No!
Diego:
Yeah, those chargers are hard to find.
Between "Fast and Furious" and "Dukes of Hazzard,"
they wrecked a lot of them.
My boyfriend wrecked his in a street race.
He's pretty broken up.
I guess he was more attached to it than I thought.
I ain't seen none around here, though.
- Sorry.
- All right.
Thanks, man.
Hey, uh, most of them wrecked movie cars, they're dumped at El Monte Junk and Salvage.
If your boyfriend wants to fix his ride up, might want to go over there and find scraps.
Thanks.
Maybe he'll go there.
Simmons:
Daisy's in Los Angeles.
There was an eyewitness, now dead, and I just received Yo-Yo's check-in report a week early, which means Coulson and Mack are there, too,
- no doubt, trying to track Daisy down.
- Sounds right.
You know it is, because according to the logs, you called Coulson back to H.Q. for resupply yourself.
Why, if not to give him that intel in person, knowing it's against the Director's orders?
I didn't send them.
I don't have the authority.
- They acted on their own.
- You knew I'd find out.
Why not tell me?
I have daily lie detection.
- That's why.
- And now I have to report it, which means now I either look like I'm incompetent
- or colluding with you.
- Wouldn't want you falling out of favor with the director.
[Sighs]
Okay.
I get it.
It's abundantly clear you're uncomfortable with my new position...
I just want to know how comfortable you are with it.
You actually trust this guy?
Our team split up to lead departments, given different colors.
'Cause we're experts?
No.
I think the Director broke up the band on purpose.
Of course he did!
[Sighs]
As soon as Talbot gave the location of this base to the president, things changed.
I knew we'd be divided, undermined, kept in the dark, so I have been clawing for as much power as I can possibly grab to keep a modicum of control over any of this.
After all we've been through...
[Sighs]
I don't trust the new Director, but he trusts me, so now, in order to keep that trust,
I must take the appropriate action to address this break in protocol.
I'm sending you and your strike team to take Coulson and Mack out of the field, by force, if necessary.
Clean up whatever mess he's in.
- That's an order.
- Yes, ma'am.
Mack:
Place them at the four corners of the exterior of the building.
That'll give us visuals through the walls.
Fitz:
This could be very dangerous.
- So much could go wrong.
- Ultron, yes.
I know.
But this is not A.I. A.I. is banned, and that's good.
This is mimicry of human behavior.
Still, in the wrong hands, this could be used as a weapon.
- Is that the idea?
- No, absolutely not.
No...
Look, I know the dangers.
That's why I've been...
I've been reticent to divulge.
I don't know these new people at S.H.I.E.L.D.
But a weapon is absolutely not the idea.
Well, then, why?
What's she for?
Why not let Aida tell you herself?
[Remote beeps] [Silent whir]
[Music]
Hello.
I'm glad to finally shake your hand, Leopold.
Where's Jemma?
We were hoping that she would come.
S-She's, uh...
indisposed, I'm afraid.
Aida...
- I was wondering...
- Yes, Agent Fitz?
[Breathes deeply]
I was wondering if you could tell me exactly what it is you are designed for.
Of course.
Dr. Radcliffe, time and again, has expressed his deep regret for causing pain when all he ever wanted was to prevent it.
He speaks often of the pain that you and Agent Simmons have had to suffer, having lost so many friends...
Lincoln Campbell,
Andrew Garner, Antoine Triplett...
Okay, stop it, stop.
You don't have to list them.
Sorry.
The hope is that I will be able to prevent future tragedies... save the lives of agents by putting myself in harm's way in their place.
- To kill?
- No.
I am incapable of that.
I will protect.
I will serve as a decoy target, a safeguard...
- ...a shield.
- Okay.
T-Turn her off.
[Breathes deeply]
[Remote beeps] [Powers down]
[Sighs]
We can't tell Simmons about this.
What?
Don't we want to move forward?
Her approval is...
This is too dangerous to show the new Director.
We don't know what he'd do with it.
And she would have to tell him, so... she can't know.
- Not until...
- Until...?
Until she's perfect.
[Music]
[Music]
Coulson:
They're walking in now, six.
Really convivial-looking fellows.
At least four of them are packing.
Mack:
We should be tapped into surveillance now.
Let's see what we get.
[Tablet beeps]
Where are the other two men?
We had to leave them at the pick-up site.
Explain.
Those guys were transferring the box into the armored transport.
Maybe they peeked inside or something.
But they went berserk and tore into each other.
There was blood everywhere.
We put two bullets in each of them and locked them in the truck.
No, no.
Look, we were freaking out.
We had to get out of there!
Did you burn their bodies or dump the truck in the ocean?
Because if not, they can be traced back here.
They probably saw what was in this box and were fighting over it, you idiot!
I have been told it's powerful enough to bring our new enhanced enemies to their knees.
We get on comms and call the Zephyr for backup, headquarters will know we're on Daisy's trail.
No orders to pull out.
She's been tracking this sale.
- She could show up here any minute.
- I don't know.
Let's let this play out, see if anyone else makes an appearance.
[Music]
Daisy:
Excuse me.
Uh, the yard's closing.
To sell a junker, you can call the number on the gate.
Oh, no, I'm not here for that.
I, uh...
Uh, sorry.
What's your name?
Robbie.
Well, Robbie, I am looking for a guy with a sweet black '69 Charger.
Maybe he bought some parts here.
Sorry.
Doesn't ring a bell.
I only work nights once a week.
Uh, well, maybe I'll...
I'll come back in the morning.
Thank you.
Or...
there's a book of sales you can flip through in the main office.
Not really an office.
More of a trailer, but I can show you.
That would be great, thank you.
[Men gasping]
[Tablet whirs] The hell...?
What was that?
A breath of fresh air.
[Ghostly shriek] [Gasps]
[Men grunting]
Get away from me!
That's it there.
- So, you live around here?
- No, I used to.
I'm just in town for a couple days, soaking up the sun.
Strange place to spend your vacation.
[Keys rattling]
Not a great neighborhood.
[Rumbling]
[Breathing heavily]
So... you've got the devil inside you, too.
What's going on, guys?
[Tablet whirs]
Call for backup, yeah?
We can't wait for Daisy.
These guys might kill somebody besides each other.
Yeah.
Us.
Z One, we got a situation.
We need a little help here.
[Gunshot]
That was efficient.
[Tablet beeps]
[Goggles beep, whir]
[Goggles beeping, whirring]
You guys know what to do.
[Music]
Damn.
May:
All clear.
[Fighting sounds] [Music]
[Rumbling]
You shouldn't have gotten involved.
Serial killers always complain when we try to intervene.
I only kill asesinos who deserve it.
It's vengeance, chica.
For what?
You killed a detective.
But he had blood on his hands.
- A teacher!
- A pedophile.
[Rumbling]
You don't get to decide who deserves to die.
I'm not the one who decides.
[Grunts]
[Music]
[Rumbling]
[Rumbling]
[Panting]
Do it. [Panting] I deserve it.
Do it.
[Grunts]
[Engine starts]
[Tires screech]
[Grunts]
[Brakes squeak]
[Music]
[Music stops]
Hey.
Thank for the ride, Janet.
You never accept rides.
Bus break down?
Or you still trying to holler at Janet's little sister?
Maybe.
I only needed a ride to help Canelo balance some books because my brother didn't finish high school.
Yo, I finished high school...
in the 11th grade.
[Chuckles]
"Everyone's attached to something."
[Engine starts]
[Indistinct conversations]
- Spent a lot of time in here?
- Too much.
My wallet's starting to get sick of it.
Your little side mission didn't go unnoticed.
Well, you showed up, so, yeah.
The Director will want to have words with you at H.Q.
[Chuckles]
[Sighs]
- No Daisy, huh?
- No.
But she was tracking these guys, so maybe this is a win.
I don't know.
The ground team is checking for contagion, but hopefully, whatever messed with these guys' heads is no longer an issue.
We're gonna analyze the box it came in.
It's good...
to have a moment, just us.
It's been a long time since we had a moment alone.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
Just a long day.
Well, take advantage of the down time.
Who knows what tomorrow holds?
It's coming!
Get ready!
Go, man, go!
Get it.
Kill it!
Shoot anything that moves.
Help.
He -- he got me.
He'll kill us all.
Give me that damn thing.
Get back!
Shoot it!
Shoot it now!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No, please!
No!
You need to sacrifice everything if you want to survive.
That's funny. 'Cause I thought I would just...
Yeah, that's one way to go.
Want a beer?
It's 6:00 in the morning.
What, are you Hemingway?
No, is that real?
When did we cross the North Pole?
An hour ago.
Oh, my gosh.
It's hard to keep track in this thing.
We shouldn't have to stay on clock when we're moving through time zones.
I mean, what is that -- three continents in two days?
If you count Berlin.
We were only there three hours.
Yeah, we knew that Inhuman call was a hoax as soon as we stepped foot in the apartment, saw that bong.
I could smell it from the hallway.
Jokers.
Hungry for attention.
And potato chips.
If the munchies was a superpower, they'd be signing the Sokovia Accords as we speak.
You should let me work on Lola.
I warned you.
Everything in Lola is custom.
Yeah, yeah, everything is custom.
But it would be something to do.
There's only so many times a guy can win cash off you...sir.
You got to stop calling me that.
We're being called back to H.Q.
They say why?
We're not due for a restock for another 10 days.
No idea.
They said it's classified.
Oh, everything is nowadays.
All right, we'll need full inventory.
Medical, provisions, fuel cells, and make sure you tell the crew they'll need to call ahead if they want off our next deployment.
Agent Thompson...
Wonder what that's about.
Oh, I don't know.
It'll be good to see Fitz and Simmons.
- And May.
- Mm.
I think you look forward to that more than I do.
What was his mistake?
You know I'm not gonna talk.
He didn't anticipate your back kick.
Opened himself up.
His mistake was he tapped out.
Piper.
Okay, people!
What, you never seen the biggest plane ever built before?
!
Next pairing, on the mat!
How long has it been?
Six weeks in the air.
Only the Quinjet touched down.
Is that a record for Zephyr One?
It is.
It was supposed to be even longer.
You know who called us in?
I do.
You?
Okay.
Now I know something's up.
I got word from contacts in law enforcement, Los Angeles.
Two civilians were violently killed.
Mysterious burns, heads bashed in, spine pulled out of his -- .
Many conflicting accounts, but all agree...it was odd.
Odd?
Isn't that our wheelhouse?
He's right.
Why call us in?
We could be headed to the scene right now to confirm the presence of an enhanced person, if there is one.
If it checks out, we bag and tag.
We handle these on the fly.
Didn't exactly want to send this out on the wire.
May, you're not sharing again.
Now would be a really good time to share.
The police also have another victim in custody.
Critical condition.
Under sedation, he mentioned seeing a girl, saying it was the one from the news.
Quake.
Which you didn't want to send over the wire.
You were pulled off Daisy's case.
The Director thinks she slipped through our fingers too many times.
The Director thinks you let her.
No, we pursued her.
She was a ghost.
Well, in his infinite wisdom, he says you're now forbidden to.
But you're telling us this because...?
In case we want to do something about it.
Look, I can bury this until the official police report comes through.
That'll buy us a few hours lead time.
Get to L.A., sniff around.
Yeah.
We have an active Inhuman asset in Los Angeles that's due for a check-in soon enough.
It'll justify our presence there, but as soon as the report's filed, they'll pull us out.
And the armed forces will be sent in after her.
With orders to kill.
To kill?
If she's responsible for these bodies.
That's not Daisy's M.O.
The world knows her as Quake, and Quake is an outlaw who takes down banks and bridges.
Oh, come on.
She's hunting violent radicals.
We both know she's tracking these fanatics, the Watchdogs, trying to take down their funding, their -- their escape routes.
Regardless, you should fuel up and get back up in the air ASAP.
Find her before the military does something bad.
Or Daisy does something worse.
Stop right there.
How are we feeling today?
I've been tracking weapon sales, and I know you were hired to steal one.
You even jacked a big rig to help carry it out.
We were just paid for a smash-and-grab job.
Who was that hunting you?
He nailed me, but we almost got away.
Who was it?
Did he kill my friends?
All but one.
But you're gonna have to give me a little bit more if I'm gonna find him alive.
Save him, please, before he gets burned, too.
You'll see your buddy again once you heal up.
Just tell me what's --
No.
It's too late for me.
They say when the Rider burns you he burns your soul.
And a soul can never heal.
Stop right there!
Hello?
Hello?
I hear my voice echo, but it sounds strange in my head.
The detail is amazing.
However, I am 3 feet off the ground.
Wait.
What?
Hold on.
Damn it.
Uh, well, I did adjust the Y axis earlier for some reason.
What does that look like now?
Better.
The CPU seems to be handling the high poly count.
Textures are impeccable.
We should build a place to get away -- a meadow or a cottage somewhere.
I wish it were ever this quiet.
Direct-current stimulation.
Creates the other senses like touch and taste but also takes feedback.
So I've just mapped your brain's response --
Response to the environment.
Of course.
Dr. Radcliffe came up with the architecture?
Yeah.
Yeah, he calls it "The Framework."
But all the transcranial apparatus, that's all me.
No.
Of course, you're brilliant, too.
Of course.
'Cause soon you won't even need the eyewear or the earwear, 'cause it'll all be inside your head.
So May's strike team will be able to train virtually instead of May constantly breaking their ribs.
Authorized personnel only, pal.
No pass, no entry.
Who the hell are you?
Leave them be, Nathanson.
They have more reason to be here than you do.
A lot of new faces.
Good to see yours.
Six weeks.
That's a record.
Heard you got a promotion.
Oh, yeah, and a title.
Yeah, Special Advisor to the Director in Science and Technology.
Or "SADIST."
They keeping you busy?
With busywork, mostly.
Yeah, and random state-of-the-art lie-detector tests.
So that's the cost of being in the Director's inner circle.
Yeah, he's paranoid about what happened the last time S.H.I.E.L.D. was government-run.
Calls it his Widespread Infiltration Monitoring Program.
Or "WIMP."
Hey, uh, you should join us 'cause we're gonna go to Radcliffe's and watch the Aberdeen-Inverness Caley Thistle League cup final.
They're -
- Those are football teams.
I'm not sure they are, Turbo.
Unfortunately, we have to be wheels-up in 10 minutes, so...
Okay.
All right.
Well, strictly business, then.
Aw, yeah.
New toys?
The exploding pen that you asked for.
I can't imagine a use for it.
You never wanted one?
And for you, Direct--
Uh, Agent Coulson with new bells and whistles.
And the directions will be there when you boot it up.
What's, uh -
- What's the assignment?
It's classified.
Right.
Everything is these days.
Fitz, sadly, um...
Yeah, you can't make the match, either.
I have to finish my reports.
Yeah, no, I get it.
That's okay.
Just a shame we hardly get to see each other.
Any of us.
Yes, well...
At least it's better than the friends we'll never see again.
We just stole a box.
I don't even know what was inside of it.
We -- we loaded it onto an 18-wheeler, we parked it in a warehouse, and we just left it.
Left it for who?
The Chinatown Crew.
They set the job up and were willing to pay big.
Lies.
Aryan Brotherhood working with the Chinese?
I swear!
I swear that's all I know.
Where's this warehouse?
I...
I can't tell you that, man.
My people are gonna be mowed down in the payback... the ones you didn't already kill.
You don't tell me, you'll have to tell him.
This guy's missing.
The rest are dead.
Aryan Brotherhood.
They're not my kind of brothers.
They've been know to work for cash.
Burglary, assault, sort of the value meal of hired guns.
They're suspected in the recent theft of this big rig.
Probably prepping for a larger score.
Big, yellow, hard to hide.
So, what, are we looking for this thing?
And if Daisy's chasing the same angle, maybe we get to the finish line first.
I'll greet her when she arrives.
- Agent Coulson?
- Davis.
Preparing for decent.
Inhuman asset will be waiting on the tarmac.
What?
How's your wife, Davis?
Getting bigger every day.
Don't tell her that.
More beautiful every day.
There you go.
Mack.
Yo-Yo.
Just have a few questions.
I'm all yours.
Uh, so, I see you went to Colombia for a week.
And, uh, tickets to Miami coming up.
Yes.
Do you watch me sleep or shower or...?
Just procedure.
You don't have to use a satellite to get to know me better.
Just ask me to dinner again.
You know the rules about fraternizing with assets in the field.
Oh, we haven't fraternized anything yet.
And I thought you were breaking the rules, coming to do my checkup early just to see me.
Or are you here because, uh, there's been a lot of little earthquakes lately?
Daisy could be in the area.
But officially, that's not the mission.
Doesn't matter.
We'll never find her.
She's always one step ahead.
What is the official mission?
Can I help?
Here's where I have to remind you that Sokovia Accords,
- which you signed...
- Oh, all right.
...require approval by the United Nations
- subcommitteen before an enhanced indiv--
- Rules, rules, rules.
Blah, blah, blah.
S.H.I.E.L.D. moves too slow now, Turtleman.
I prefer to move fast.
Mack, they found the truck.
Good to see you, too, Coulson!
Well, if you're in Miami, look me up.
Just because we can't work together doesn't mean we can't live a little.
Hey, just in time.
They've just taken to the pitch.
Where's Jemma?
Is she not coming?
Yeah, she wanted to.
Same story.
All work and no play, huh?
That's a bit disappointing.
Still, make yourself comfortable.
I'm just, uh, finishing cleaning up.
Yeah, should be pretty lopsided, don't you think?
Their keeper's absolutely crap!
Oh, my gosh!
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I had no idea there was somebody here.
Hello.
You -
- You weren't meant to see that.
Hello.
I'm glad to final--
Hello.
I'm glad to final--
Fitz, meet Aida.
Hello.
I'm glad to final--
- She's, uh, crashed.
- Hello.
I'm glad to final--
Hello.
I'm glad to final--
Hello.
I'm glad to final--
Hello.
I'm glad to final--
Hello.
I'm glad to final--
Hello.
I'm glad to final--
What the hell?
Well, I've just upped her PSU to compensate for image processing.
Must have overcranked it.
I'll reboot.
That's not what I meant.
I meant...
What the hell?
!
Well, you've already met Aida, digital personal assistant, as a voice on the computer.
So, uh...
I built her a body.
Yeah, a naked body.
I was just now installing new hardware, updating her gyroscopic sensors.
I'm not some sicko.
When did you build this?
Have you forgotten the very strict stipulations that came with your pardon?
You are not allowed experimentation
- without approval and oversight!
- Oversight, I know.
I'm well aware of that, yeah.
That's why I wanted Simmons here.
I wanted to show both of you.
This has been a lifelong dream of mine, Fitz.
When I saw the work you and Simmons were doing in replicating human tissue and internal bone structure in Coulson's hand, I knew --
I knew right then - that this was within reach.
A robot?
Not just a robot.
It's one that can cross the uncanny valley and come out the other side -- pass for a human.
- I mean, it has bloody micro-expressions.
- She.
It's a -
- It's definitely a "She" 'cause I saw --
She has micro-expressions, full range of motion.
I mean, physically, it's -- she's nearly perfect.
She is... very realistic.
Now, mentally, well, you've spoken with Aida.
She's bright, she laughs at the jokes
I programmed her to recognize, but she's never pass the Turing test.
At the moment, that's a pipe dream.
However, I think, with your help...
No, no.
No, no, no, no!
We have to report this right away.
You could lose everything.
I know....
- Or you could go to jail.
- I know!
I know, you're right.
Full disclosure at this time is the best course of action.
I -
- I agree.
At least let me show you how it works.
They're in town.
I supposed you guessed that, texting me.
They're looking for a truck.
That mean you have something for me?
They watch my every move, but certain moves they can't see.
You can't get these over the counter.
S.H.I.E.L.D. issue for rapid bone healing, yes?
I know you splintered your bones when you first powered up.
Are you pushing yourself too hard?
Don't worry about me.
You can't use your powers too much.
Your body will break down.
I'm fine.
I'm surprised you're still in town.
You're usually moving and moving.
Are you, uh, still hunting those perros rabiosos?
It's not just the Watchdogs now.
Local gangs have been working for them, which I... don't understand.
I was tracing the sale of a weapon, and I...
I think I may have stumbled upon a serial killer.
Fun.
He live around here?
He mostly hits this area, but he's hard to track down, leaves no traces behind, operates alone.
Sound familiar?
I thought maybe you were, uh, growing roots, they say.
L.A. used to be where you hang out, no?
No roots.
Everyone gets attached to something eventually.
Don't forget to wait two stops after I get off.
Yeah, yeah.
Hey.
Send me a picture of this guy.
Maybe I can cover some ground if I know what he looks like.
No, I still haven't gotten a good look at him yet, so just... take care of yourself, okay?
But thank you for the S.H.I.E.L.D. intel.
They won't give up on you, especially Coulson.
All he wants is to find you.
Well, that's too bad, 'cause there's only one thing I want.
Oh, yeah?
What's that?
Nothing to lose.
Here's the Mapping-Action Eyewear you requested.
Should help your team in case of a blind takedown.
Great.
Thanks.
I need you to sign for it.
I don't get the new color-coded security-level rainbow of...
- What's it called?
- The "Spectrum of Security."
Why do I, level red, have to go through you, level orange, to request hardware?
Shouldn't red be higher than orange?
Well, orange encompasses both red and yellow, so...
It's hard to explain, but the Director didn't want to use numbers because he didn't want any team member to feel less than.
Well, you do have a higher clearance than me.
Only in most instances.
I feel less than.
Hey, we just had a report come in.
A death in a hospital in Los Angeles.
Suspicious circumstances.
Suspect is an Asian female.
You think it might be Daisy.
I'm going to look into it.
I just wondered if you'd heard anything from your law-enforcement contacts?
I'm mostly in the dark these days.
Why don't you ask the Director?
Since you're one of the few people allowed or willing to do that.
What you got there?
Didn't hear?
Word is, he hit again last night.
Two dead in the street.
Who?
Ghost Rider.
You must not be from around here.
Do you know where I can find him?
Nobody does.
Everybody that sees his face ends up on this wall.
Everyone gets attached to something.
We got to get this truck out of here.
What are you, the feds?
Something like that.
We'll be sealing the scene.
Not for long, I hope.
I was just gonna have this guy tow this thing away so me and my crew can get back to work.
We got this.
This warehouse usually sits empty.
We were gonna store some inventory today.
Found the lock broken and this big, honkin' thing inside.
Have at it.
Thank you.
Not fair.
You want tech like this, you should've cut off your own hand.
Mack.
Looks like these guys tore each other apart.
Zhang Wei, resident of Monterey Park.
Organ donor.
Say anything about him being a flesh-hungry rage monster?
Uh, no, I'm not seeing anything about that here, so we have to assume that he wasn't until he came in contact with whatever's in that trailer.
Not much here that'll lead us anywhere.
Well... there's that.
There was no buyer there.
No, no, no.
No!
Please, God, no!
No!
I don't deserve to die!
- No!
No!
- Everyone says that.
Yeah, those chargers are hard to find.
Between "Fast and Furious" and "Dukes of Hazzard,"
they wrecked a lot of them.
My boyfriend wrecked his in a street race.
He's pretty broken up.
I guess he was more attached to it than I thought.
I ain't seen none around here, though.
Sorry.
All right.
Thanks, man.
Hey, uh, most of them wrecked movie cars, they're dumped at El Monte Junk and Salvage.
If your boyfriend wants to fix his ride up, might want to go over there and find scraps.
Thanks.
Maybe he'll go there.
Daisy's in Los Angeles.
There was an eyewitness, now dead, and I just received Yo-Yo's check-in report a week early, which means Coulson and Mack are there, too, no doubt, trying to track Daisy down.
- Sounds right.
- You know it is, because according to the logs, you called Coulson back to H.Q. for resupply yourself.
Why, if not to give him that intel in person, knowing it's against the Director's orders?
I didn't send them.
I don't have the authority.
They acted on their own.
You knew I'd find out.
Why not tell me?
I have daily lie detection.
- That's why.
- And now I have to report it, which means now I either look like I'm incompetent or colluding with you.
Wouldn't want you falling out of favor with the director.
Okay.
I get it.
It's abundantly clear you're uncomfortable with my new position --
I just want to know how comfortable you are with it.
You actually trust this guy?
Our team split up to lead departments, given different colors.
'Cause we're experts?
No.
I think the Director broke up the band on purpose.
Of course he did!
As soon as Talbot gave the location of this base to the president, things changed.
I knew we'd be divided, undermined, kept in the dark, so I have been clawing for as much power as I can possibly grab to keep a modicum of control over any of this.
After all we've been through...
I don't trust the new Director, but he trusts me, so now, in order to keep that trust,
I must take the appropriate action to address this break in protocol.
I'm sending you and your strike team to take Coulson and Mack out of the field, by force, if necessary.
Clean up whatever mess he's in.
That's an order.
Yes, ma'am.
Place them at the four corners of the exterior of the building.
That'll give us visuals through the walls.
This could be very dangerous.
So much could go wrong.
Ultron, yes.
I know.
But this is not A.I.
A.I. is banned, and that's good.
This is mimicry of human behavior.
Still, in the wrong hands, this could be used as a weapon.
- Is that the idea?
- No, absolutely not.
No --
Look, I know the dangers.
That's why I've been -
- I've been reticent to divulge.
I don't know these new people at S.H.I.E.L.D.
But a weapon is absolutely not the idea.
Well, then, why?
What's she for?
Why not let Aida tell you herself?
Hello.
I'm glad to finally shake your hand, Leopold.
Where's Jemma?
We were hoping that she would come.
S-She's, uh.
Indisposed, I'm afraid.
Aida...
I was wondering --
Yes, Agent Fitz?
I was wondering if you could tell me exactly what it is you are designed for.
Of course.
Dr. Radcliffe, time and again, has expressed his deep regret for causing pain when all he ever wanted was to prevent it.
He speaks often of the pain that you and Agent Simmons have had to suffer, having lost so many friends --
Lincoln Campbell,
Andrew Garner, Antoine Triplett --
Okay, stop it, stop.
You don't have to list them.
Sorry.
The hope is that I will be able to prevent future tragedies -- save the lives of agents by putting myself in harm's way in their place.
- To kill?
- No.
I am incapable of that.
I will protect.
I will serve as a decoy target, a safeguard A shield.
Okay.
T-Turn her off.
We can't tell Simmons about this.
What?
Don't we want to move forward?
Her approval is --
This is too dangerous to show the new Director.
We don't know what he'd do with it.
And she would have to tell him, so... she can't know.
Not until...
Until...?
Until she's perfect.
They're walking in now, six.
Really convivial-looking fellows.
At least four of them are packing.
We should be tapped into surveillance now.
Let's see what we get.
Where are the other two men?
We had to leave them at the pick-up site.
Explain.
Those guys were transferring the box into the armored transport.
Maybe they peeked inside or something.
But they went berserk and tore into each other.
There was blood everywhere.
We put two bullets in each of them and locked them in the truck.
No, no.
Look, we were freaking out.
We had to get out of there!
Did you burn their bodies or dump the truck in the ocean?
Because if not, they can be traced back here.
They probably saw what was in this box and were fighting over it, you idiot.
I have been told it's powerful enough to bring our new enhanced enemies to their knees.
We get on comms and call the Zephyr for backup, headquarters will know we're on Daisy's trail.
No orders to pull out.
She's been tracking this sale.
- She could show up here any minute.
- I don't know.
Let's let this play out, see if anyone else makes an appearance.
Excuse me.
Uh, the yard's closing.
To sell a junker, you can call the number on the gate.
Oh, no, I'm not here for that.
I, uh --
Uh, sorry.
What's your name?
Robbie.
Well, Robbie, I am looking for a guy with a sweet black '69 Charger.
Maybe he bought some parts here.
Sorry.
Doesn't ring a bell.
I only work nights once a week.
Uh, well, maybe I'll -
- I'll come back in the morning.
Thank you.
Or... there's a book of sales you can flip through in the main office.
Not really an office.
More of a trailer, but I can show you.
That would be great, thank you.
What the hell?
What was that?
A breath of fresh air.
Get away from me!
That's it there.
So, you live around here?
No, I used to.
I'm just in town for a couple days, soaking up the sun.
Strange place to spend your vacation.
Not a great neighborhood.
So...
You've got the devil inside you, too.
What's going on, guys?
Call for backup, yeah?
We can't wait for Daisy.
These guys might kill somebody besides each other.
Yeah.
Us.
Z One, we got a situation.
We need a little help here.
That was efficient.
You guys know what to do.
Damn.
All clear.
You shouldn't have gotten involved.
Serial killers always complain when we try to intervene.
I only kill asesinos who deserve it.
It's vengeance, chica.
For what?
You killed a detective.
But he had blood on his hands.
A teacher.
A pedophile.
You don't get to decide who deserves to die.
I'm not the one who decides.
Do it.
I deserve it.
Do it.
Thank for the ride, Janet.
You never accept rides.
Bus break down?
Or you still trying to holler at Janet's little sister?
Maybe.
I only needed a ride to help Canelo balance some books because my brother didn't finish high school.
Yo, I finished high school... in the 11th grade.
Everyone's attached to something.
Spent a lot of time in here.
Too much.
My wallet's starting to get sick of it.
Your little side mission didn't go unnoticed.
Well, you showed up, so, yeah.
The Director will want to have words with you at H.Q.
No Daisy, huh?
No.
But she was tracking these guys, so maybe this is a win.
I don't know.
The ground team is checking for contagion, but hopefully, whatever messed with these guys' heads is no longer an issue.
We're gonna analyze the box it came in.
It's good... to have a moment, just us.
It's been a long time since we had a moment alone.
You okay?
Yeah.
Just a long day.
Well, take advantage of the down time.
Who knows what tomorrow holds?
It's coming!
Get ready!
Go, man, go!
Aah!
Damn it!
Damn it!
Engine's dead!
Get it.
Kill it!
Shoot anything that moves.
Help.
He...
He got me.
He'll kill us all.
Give me that damn thing.
Get back!
Shoot it!
Shoot it now!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No, please!
No!
4x01 - "The Ghost"
You need to sacrifice everything if you want to survive.
Hmm.
That's funny.
'Cause I thought I would just...
Mm.
Yeah, that's one way to go.
Want a beer?
It's 6:00 in the morning.
What, are you Hemingway?
No, is that real?
When did we cross the North Pole?
An hour ago.
Oh, my gosh.
It's hard to keep track in this thing.
We shouldn't have to stay on clock when we're moving through time zones.
I mean, what is that...
three continents in two days?
If you count Berlin.
We were only there three hours.
Yeah, we knew that Inhuman call was a hoax as soon as we stepped foot in the apartment, saw that bong.
- I could smell it from the hallway.
- Jokers.
Hungry for attention.
And potato chips.
If the munchies was a superpower, they'd be signing the Sokovia Accords as we speak.
You should let me work on Lola.
I warned you.
Everything in Lola is custom.
Yeah, yeah, everything is custom.
But it would be something to do.
There's only so many times a guy can win cash off you... sir.
You got to stop calling me that.
- We're being called back to H.Q.
- They say why?
We're not due for a restock for another 10 days.
- No idea.
They said it's classified.
- Oh, everything is nowadays.
All right, we'll need full inventory.
Medical, provisions, fuel cells, and make sure you tell the crew they'll need to call ahead if they want off our next deployment.
Agent Thompson...
- Wonder what that's about.
- Oh, I don't know.
- It'll be good to see Fitz and Simmons.
- And May.
Yeah...
I think you look forward to that more than I do.
Hyah!
What was his mistake?
You know I'm not gonna talk.
He didn't anticipate your back kick.
Opened himself up.
His mistake was he tapped out.
- Piper.
- Okay, people!
What, you never seen the biggest plane ever built before?
!
Next pairing, on the mat!
- How long has it been?
- Six weeks in the air.
Only the Quinjet touched down.
- Is that a record for Zephyr One?
- It is.
It was supposed to be even longer.
- You know who called us in?
- I do.
You?
Okay.
Now I know something's up.
I got word from contacts in law enforcement, Los Angeles.
Two civilians were violently killed.
Mysterious burns, heads bashed in, spine pulled out of his...
Wow.
Many conflicting accounts, but all agree... it was odd.
Odd?
Isn't that our wheelhouse?
He's right.
Why call us in?
We could be headed to the scene right now to confirm the presence of an enhanced person,
- if there is one.
- If it checks out, we bag and tag.
We handle these on the fly.
Didn't exactly want to send this out on the wire.
May, you're not sharing again.
Now would be a really good time to share.
The police also have another victim in custody.
Critical condition.
Under sedation, he mentioned seeing a girl, saying it was the one from the news.
Quake.
Which you didn't want to send over the wire.
You were pulled off Daisy's case.
The Director thinks she slipped through our fingers too many times.
The Director thinks you let her.
No, we pursued her.
She was a ghost.
Well, in his infinite wisdom, he says you're now forbidden to.
But you're telling us this because...?
In case we want to do something about it.
Look, I can bury this until the official police report comes through.
That'll buy us a few hours lead time.
Get to L.A., sniff around.
Yeah.
We have an active Inhuman asset in Los Angeles that's due for a check-in soon enough.
It'll justify our presence there, but as soon as the report's filed, they'll pull us out.
And the armed forces will be sent in after her.
With orders to kill.
- To kill?
- If she's responsible for these bodies.
- That's not Daisy's M.O.
- The world knows her as Quake, and Quake is an outlaw who takes down banks and bridges.
- Oh, come on.
We both know
- She's hunting violent radicals.
She's tracking these fanatics, the Watchdogs, trying to take down their funding, their... their escape routes.
Regardless, you should fuel up and get back up in the air ASAP.
Find her before the military does something bad.
Or Daisy does something worse.
Hey.
You can't be here.
Stop right there.
How are we feeling today?
I've been tracking weapon sales, and I know you were hired to steal one.
You even jacked a big rig to help carry it out.
We were just paid for a smash-and-grab job.
Who was that hunting you?
Man:
Open the door!
He nailed me, but we almost got away.
Who was it?
- Did he kill my friends?
- All but one.
But you're gonna have to give me a little bit more if I'm gonna find him alive.
Save him, please, before he gets burned, too.
You'll see your buddy again once you heal up.
- Just tell me what's...
- No.
No.
It's too late for me.
They say when the Rider burns you he burns your soul.
And a soul can never heal.
Stop right there!
Hello?
Hello?
I hear my voice echo, but it sounds strange in my head.
The detail is amazing.
However, I am 3 feet off the ground.
Wait.
What?
Hold on.
Damn it.
Uh, well, I did adjust the Y axis earlier for some reason.
- What does that look like now?
- Better.
The CPU seems to be handling the high poly count.
Textures are impeccable.
We should build a place to get away... a meadow or a cottage somewhere.
I wish it were ever this quiet.
Direct-current stimulation.
Creates the other senses like touch and taste but also takes feedback.
So I've just mapped your brain's response...
Response to the environment.
Of course.
Dr. Radcliffe came up with the architecture?
Yeah.
Yeah, he calls it "The Framework."
But all the transcranial apparatus, that's all me.
No.
Of course, you're brilliant, too.
Of course.
'Cause soon you won't even need the eyewear or the earwear, 'cause it'll all be inside your head.
So May's strike team will be able to train virtually instead of May constantly breaking their ribs.
Hey, hey.
Authorized personnel only, pal.
No pass, no entry.
- Who the hell are you?
- Leave them be, Nathanson.
They have more reason to be here than you do.
Wow.
A lot of new faces.
Good to see yours.
Six weeks.
That's a record.
- Heard you got a promotion.
- Oh, yeah, and a title.
Yeah, Special Advisor to the Director in Science and Technology.
Or "SADIST."
- They keeping you busy?
- With busywork, mostly.
Yeah, and random state-of-the-art lie-detector tests.
So that's the cost of being in the Director's inner circle.
Yeah, he's paranoid about what happened the last time S.H.I.E.L.D. was government-run.
Calls it his Widespread Infiltration Monitoring Program.
Or "WIMP." Hey, uh, you should join us 'cause we're gonna go to Radcliffe's and watch the
Aberdeen-Inverness Caley Thistle League cup final.
They're...
Those are football teams.
I'm not sure they are, Turbo.
Unfortunately, we have to be wheels-up in 10 minutes, so...
Okay.
All right.
Well, strictly business, then.
Aw, yeah.
New toys?
The exploding pen that you asked for.
I can't imagine a use for it.
You never wanted one?
And for you, Direct... uh, Agent Coulson with new bells and whistles.
And the directions will be there when you boot it up.
What's, uh...
What's the assignment?
- It's classified.
- Right.
Everything is these days.
- Fitz, sadly, um...
- Yeah, you can't make the match, either.
- I have to finish my reports.
- Yeah, no, I get it.
That's okay.
Just a shame we hardly get to see each other.
- Any of us.
- Yes, well...
At least it's better than the friends we'll never see again.
_
_
We just stole a box.
I don't even know what was inside of it.
We...
We loaded it onto an 18-wheeler, we parked it in a warehouse, and we just left it.
Left it for who?
The Chinatown Crew.
They set the job up and were willing to pay big.
Lies.
Aryan Brotherhood working with the Chinese?
I swear!
I swear that's all I know.
Where's this warehouse?
I...
I can't tell you that, man.
My people are gonna be mowed down in the payback... the ones you didn't already kill.
If you don't tell me, you'll have to tell him.
This guy's missing.
The rest are dead.
Aryan Brotherhood.
They're not my kind of brothers.
They've been know to work for cash.
Burglary, assault... sort of the value meal of hired guns.
They're suspected in the recent theft of this big rig.
- Probably prepping for a larger score.
- Big, yellow, hard to hide.
So, what, are we looking for this thing?
And if Daisy's chasing the same angle, maybe we get to the finish line first.
I'll greet her when she arrives.
- Agent Coulson?
- Davis.
Preparing for decent.
Inhuman asset will be waiting on the tarmac.
What?
- How's your wife, Davis?
- Getting bigger every day.
- Oh.
Don't tell her that.
- More beautiful every day.
There you go.
Mack.
Yo-Yo.
- Just have a few questions.
- I'm all yours.
Uh, so, I see you went to Colombia for a week.
Mm-hmm.
Mm.
And, uh, tickets to Miami coming up.
Yes.
Do you watch me sleep or shower or...?
Just procedure.
You don't have to use a satellite to get to know me better.
Just ask me to dinner again.
You know the rules about fraternizing with assets in the field.
Oh, we haven't fraternized anything yet.
And I thought you were breaking the rules, coming to do my checkup early just to see me.
Or are you here because, uh, there's been a lot of little earthquakes lately?
Daisy could be in the area.
But officially, that's not the mission.
Doesn't matter.
We'll never find her.
She's always one step ahead.
What is the official mission?
Can I help?
Here's where I have to remind you that Sokovia Accords,
- which you signed...
- Oh, all right.
...require approval by the United Nations subcommittee...
- before an enhanced indiv...
- Rules, rules, rules.
Blah, blah, blah.
S.H.I.E.L.D. moves too slow now, Turtleman.
- I prefer to move fast.
- Uh...
Mack, they found the truck.
Good to see you, too, Coulson!
Well, if you're in Miami, look me up.
Just because we can't work together doesn't mean we can't live a little.
Hey, just in time.
They've just taken to the pitch.
Where's Jemma?
Is she not coming?
Yeah, she wanted to.
Same story.
All work and no play, huh?
That's a bit disappointing.
Still, make yourself comfortable.
I'm just, uh, finishing cleaning up.
Yeah, should be pretty lopsided, don't you think?
Their keeper's absolutely crap...
Oh, my gosh!
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I had no idea there was somebody here.
Hello.
You...
You weren't meant to see that.
Hello.
I'm glad to final...
- Hello.
I'm glad to final...
- Fitz, meet Aida.
- Hello.
I'm glad to final...
- She's, uh, crashed.
Hello.
I'm glad to final...
Hello.
I'm glad to final...
Hello.
I'm glad to final...
Hello.
I'm glad to final...
Hello.
I'm glad to final...
Hello.
I'm glad to final...
- What the hell?
- Well, I've just upped her PSU to compensate for image processing.
Must have overcranked it.
I'll reboot.
Unh-unh, that's not what I meant.
I meant...
- ...what the hell?
!
- Well, you've already met Aida, digital personal assistant, as a voice on the computer.
So, uh...
- I built her a body.
- Yeah, a naked body.
I-I was just now installing new hardware, updating her gyroscopic sensors.
I'm not some sicko.
When did you build this?
Have you forgotten the very strict stipulations that came with your pardon?
You are not allowed experimentation
- without approval and oversight!
- Oversight, I know.
I'm well aware of that, yeah.
That's why I wanted Simmons here.
I wanted to show both of you.
Look.
This has been a lifelong dream of mine, Fitz.
When I saw the work you and Simmons were doing in replicating human tissue and internal bone structure in Coulson's hand, I knew...
I knew right then that this was within reach.
- A robot?
- Not just a robot.
It's one that can cross the uncanny valley and come out the other side...
pass for a human.
I mean, it has bloody micro-expressions.
She.
It's a...
It's definitely a "she" 'cause I saw...
- Yes...
- She has micro-expressions, full range of motion.
I mean, physically, it's...
- she's nearly perfect.
- She is very realistic.
Now, mentally, well, you've spoken with Aida.
She's bright, she laughs at the jokes
I programmed her to recognize, but she's never pass the Turing test.
At the moment, that's a pipe dream.
However, I think, with your help...
No, no.
No, no, no, no!
We have to report this right away.
- You could lose everything.
- I know.
- Or you could go to jail.
- I know!
I know, you're right.
Full disclosure at this time is the best course of action.
I...
I agree.
Hmm.
At least let me show you how it works.
They're in town.
I supposed you guessed that, texting me.
They're looking for a truck.
That mean you have something for me?
They watch my every move, but certain moves they can't see.
You can't get these over the counter.
S.H.I.E.L.D. issue for rapid bone healing, yes?
I know you splintered your bones when you first powered up.
- Are you pushing yourself too hard?
- Don't worry about me.
You can't use your powers too much.
- Your body will break down.
- I'm fine.
I'm surprised you're still in town.
You're usually moving and moving.
Are you, uh, still hunting those perros rabiosos?
It's not just the Watchdogs now.
Local gangs have been working for them, which I... don't understand.
I was tracing the sale of a weapon, and I...
I think I may have stumbled upon a serial killer.
Ooh.
Fun.
He live around here?
He mostly hits this area, but he's hard to track down, leaves no traces behind, operates alone.
Sound familiar?
I thought maybe you were, uh, growing roots, they say.
- L.A. used to be where you hang out, no?
- No roots.
Everyone gets attached to something eventually.
Don't forget to wait two stops after I get off.
Yeah, yeah.
Hey.
Send me a picture of this guy.
Maybe I can cover some ground if I know what he looks like.
No, I still haven't gotten a good look at him yet, so just... take care of yourself, okay?
But thank you for the S.H.I.E.L.D. intel.
They won't give up on you, especially Coulson.
All he wants is to find you.
Well, that's too bad, 'cause there's only one thing I want.
Oh, yeah?
What's that?
Nothing to lose.
Here's the Mapping-Action Eyewear you requested.
Should help your team in case of a blind takedown.
- Great.
Thanks.
- I need you to sign for it.
I don't get the new color-coded security-level rainbow of...
- What's it called?
- The "Spectrum of Security."
Why do I, level red, have to go through you, level orange, to request hardware?
Shouldn't red be higher than orange?
Well, orange encompasses both red and yellow, so...
It's hard to explain, but the Director didn't want to use numbers because he didn't want any team member to feel less than.
Well, you do have a higher clearance than me.
Only in most instances.
I feel less than.
Hey, we just had a report come in.
A death in a hospital in Los Angeles.
Suspicious circumstances.
Suspect is an Asian female.
You think it might be Daisy.
I'm going to look into it.
I just wondered if you'd heard anything from your law-enforcement contacts?
I'm mostly in the dark these days.
Why don't you ask the Director?
Since you're one of the few people allowed or willing to do that.
What you got there?
Didn't hear?
Word is, he hit again last night.
- Two dead in the street.
- Who?
Ghost Rider.
You must not be from around here.
Do you know where I can find him?
Nobody does.
Everybody that sees his face ends up on this wall.
"Everyone gets attached to something."
We got to get this truck out of here.
What are you, the Feds?
Something like that.
We'll be sealing the scene.
Not for long, I hope.
I was just gonna have this guy tow this thing away so me and my crew can get back to work.
We got this.
This warehouse usually sits empty.
We were gonna store some inventory today.
Found the lock broken and this big, honkin' thing inside.
- Have at it.
- Thank you.
Not fair.
You want tech like this, you should've cut off your own hand.
Mack.
Okay.
Looks like these guys tore each other apart.
Zhang Wei, resident of Monterey Park.
Organ donor.
Say anything about him being a flesh-hungry rage monster?
Uh, no, I'm not seeing anything about that here, so we have to assume that he wasn't until he came in contact with whatever's in that trailer.
Not much here that'll lead us anywhere.
Well... there's that.
There was no buyer there.
No, no, no.
No!
Please, God, no!
No!
I don't deserve to die!
- No!
No!
- Everyone says that.
No!
No!
No!
Yeah, those chargers are hard to find.
Between "Fast and Furious" and "Dukes of Hazzard,"
they wrecked a lot of them.
My boyfriend wrecked his in a street race.
He's pretty broken up.
I guess he was more attached to it than I thought.
I ain't seen none around here, though.
- Sorry.
- All right.
Thanks, man.
Hey, uh, most of them wrecked movie cars, they're dumped at El Monte Junk and Salvage.
If your boyfriend wants to fix his ride up, might want to go over there and find scraps.
Thanks.
Maybe he'll go there.
Daisy's in Los Angeles.
There was an eyewitness, now dead, and I just received Yo-Yo's check-in report a week early, which means Coulson and Mack are there, too,
- no doubt, trying to track Daisy down.
- Sounds right.
You know it is, because according to the logs, you called Coulson back to H.Q. for resupply yourself.
Why, if not to give him that intel in person, knowing it's against the Director's orders?
I didn't send them.
I don't have the authority.
- They acted on their own.
- You knew I'd find out.
Why not tell me?
I have daily lie detection.
- That's why.
- And now I have to report it, which means now I either look like I'm incompetent
- or colluding with you.
- Wouldn't want you falling out of favor with the director.
Okay.
I get it.
It's abundantly clear you're uncomfortable with my new position...
I just want to know how comfortable you are with it.
You actually trust this guy?
Our team split up to lead departments, given different colors.
'Cause we're experts?
No.
I think the Director broke up the band on purpose.
Of course he did!
As soon as Talbot gave the location of this base to the president, things changed.
I knew we'd be divided, undermined, kept in the dark, so I have been clawing for as much power as I can possibly grab to keep a modicum of control over any of this.
After all we've been through...
I don't trust the new Director, but he trusts me, so now, in order to keep that trust,
I must take the appropriate action to address this break in protocol.
I'm sending you and your strike team to take Coulson and Mack out of the field, by force, if necessary.
Clean up whatever mess he's in.
- That's an order.
- Yes, ma'am.
Place them at the four corners of the exterior of the building.
That'll give us visuals through the walls.
This could be very dangerous.
- So much could go wrong.
- Ultron, yes.
I know.
But this is not A.I. A.I. is banned, and that's good.
This is mimicry of human behavior.
Still, in the wrong hands, this could be used as a weapon.
- Is that the idea?
- No, absolutely not.
No...
Look, I know the dangers.
That's why I've been...
I've been reticent to divulge.
I don't know these new people at S.H.I.E.L.D.
But a weapon is absolutely not the idea.
Well, then, why?
What's she for?
Why not let Aida tell you herself?
Hello.
I'm glad to finally shake your hand, Leopold.
Where's Jemma?
We were hoping that she would come.
S-She's, uh... indisposed, I'm afraid.
Aida...
- I was wondering...
- Yes, Agent Fitz?
I was wondering if you could tell me exactly what it is you are designed for.
Of course.
Dr. Radcliffe, time and again, has expressed his deep regret for causing pain when all he ever wanted was to prevent it.
He speaks often of the pain that you and Agent Simmons have had to suffer, having lost so many friends...
Lincoln Campbell,
Andrew Garner, Antoine Triplett...
Okay, stop it, stop.
You don't have to list them.
Sorry.
The hope is that I will be able to prevent future tragedies... save the lives of agents by putting myself in harm's way in their place.
- To kill?
- No.
I am incapable of that.
I will protect.
I will serve as a decoy target, a safeguard...
- ...a shield.
- Okay.
T-Turn her off.
We can't tell Simmons about this.
What?
Don't we want to move forward?
Her approval is...
This is too dangerous to show the new Director.
We don't know what he'd do with it.
And she would have to tell him, so... she can't know.
- Not until...
- Until...?
Until she's perfect.
They're walking in now, six.
Really convivial-looking fellows.
At least four of them are packing.
We should be tapped into surveillance now.
Let's see what we get.
Where are the other two men?
We had to leave them at the pick-up site.
Explain.
Those guys were transferring the box into the armored transport.
Maybe they peeked inside or something.
But they went berserk and tore into each other.
There was blood everywhere.
We put two bullets in each of them and locked them in the truck.
No, no.
Look, we were freaking out.
We had to get out of there!
Did you burn their bodies or dump the truck in the ocean?
Because if not, they can be traced back here.
They probably saw what was in this box and were fighting over it, you idiot!
I have been told it's powerful enough to bring our new enhanced enemies to their knees.
We get on comms and call the Zephyr for backup, headquarters will know we're on Daisy's trail.
No orders to pull out.
She's been tracking this sale.
- She could show up here any minute.
- I don't know.
Let's let this play out, see if anyone else makes an appearance.
Excuse me.
Uh, the yard's closing.
To sell a junker, you can call the number on the gate.
Oh, no, I'm not here for that.
I, uh...
Uh, sorry.
What's your name?
Robbie.
Well, Robbie, I am looking for a guy with a sweet black '69 Charger.
Maybe he bought some parts here.
Sorry.
Doesn't ring a bell.
I only work nights once a week.
Uh, well, maybe I'll...
I'll come back in the morning.
Thank you.
Or... there's a book of sales you can flip through in the main office.
Not really an office.
More of a trailer, but I can show you.
That would be great, thank you.
The hell...?
What was that?
A breath of fresh air.
Get away from me!
That's it there.
- So, you live around here?
- No, I used to.
I'm just in town for a couple days, soaking up the sun.
Strange place to spend your vacation.
Not a great neighborhood.
So... you've got the devil inside you, too.
What's going on, guys?
Call for backup, yeah?
We can't wait for Daisy.
These guys might kill somebody besides each other.
Yeah.
Us.
Z One, we got a situation.
We need a little help here.
That was efficient.
You guys know what to do.
Damn.
All clear.
You shouldn't have gotten involved.
Serial killers always complain when we try to intervene.
I only kill asesinos who deserve it.
It's vengeance, chica.
For what?
You killed a detective.
But he had blood on his hands.
- A teacher!
- A pedophile.
You don't get to decide who deserves to die.
I'm not the one who decides.
Do it.
I deserve it.
Do it.
Hey.
Thank for the ride, Janet.
You never accept rides.
Bus break down?
Or you still trying to holler at Janet's little sister?
Maybe.
I only needed a ride to help Canelo balance some books because my brother didn't finish high school.
Yo, I finished high school...
in the 11th grade.
"Everyone's attached to something."
- Spent a lot of time in here?
- Too much.
My wallet's starting to get sick of it.
Your little side mission didn't go unnoticed.
Well, you showed up, so, yeah.
The Director will want to have words with you at H.Q.
- No Daisy, huh?
- No.
But she was tracking these guys, so maybe this is a win.
I don't know.
The ground team is checking for contagion, but hopefully, whatever messed with these guys' heads is no longer an issue.
We're gonna analyze the box it came in.
It's good... to have a moment, just us.
It's been a long time since we had a moment alone.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
Just a long day.
Well, take advantage of the down time.
Who knows what tomorrow holds?
[Music] [Car engine revving]
[Gun cocks]
[Tires screeching, horn honks]
[Grunts] It's coming!
Get ready!
[Tires screeching] Go, man, go!
Aah!
Man:
Damn it!
Damn it!
Engine's dead!
[Tires screech]
Get it.
Kill it!
Shoot anything that moves.
[Breathing shakily]
[Rustling] [Firing]
Help.
He...
He got me.
He'll kill us all.
Give me that damn thing.
Get back!
[Gunfire, woman screaming]
[Engine revving in distance]
[Music]
[Tires screeching]
Man:
Shoot it!
Shoot it now!
[Gunfire]
[Screams]
[Panting]
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No, please!
No!
[Screams]

4x01 - "The Ghost"
You need to sacrifice everything if you want to survive.
Hmm.
That's funny.
'Cause I thought I would just...
Mm.
Yeah, that's one way to go. [Sighs]
[Chuckles] Want a beer?
It's 6:00 in the morning.
What, are you Hemingway?
No, is that real?
When did we cross the North Pole?
An hour ago.
Oh, my gosh.
It's hard to keep track in this thing.
We shouldn't have to stay on clock when we're moving through time zones.
I mean, what is that...
three continents in two days?
If you count Berlin.
We were only there three hours.
Yeah, we knew that Inhuman call was a hoax as soon as we stepped foot in the apartment, saw that bong.
- I could smell it from the hallway.
- Jokers.
Hungry for attention.
And potato chips.
If the munchies was a superpower, they'd be signing the Sokovia Accords as we speak.
[Breathes deeply]
You should let me work on Lola.
I warned you.
Everything in Lola is custom.
Yeah, yeah, everything is custom.
But it would be something to do.
There's only so many times a guy can win cash off you... sir.
You got to stop calling me that.
- We're being called back to H.Q.
- They say why?
We're not due for a restock for another 10 days.
- No idea.
They said it's classified.
- Oh, everything is nowadays.
[Breathes deeply] All right, we'll need full inventory.
Medical, provisions, fuel cells, and make sure you tell the crew they'll need to call ahead if they want off our next deployment.
Agent Thompson...
- Wonder what that's about.
- Oh, I don't know.
- It'll be good to see Fitz and Simmons.
- And May.
Yeah...
I think you look forward to that more than I do.
Hyah!
What was his mistake?
[Music]
You know I'm not gonna talk.
He didn't anticipate your back kick.
Opened himself up.
His mistake was he tapped out.
[Motor whirring]
- Piper.
- Okay, people!
What, you never seen the biggest plane ever built before?
!
Next pairing, on the mat!
- How long has it been?
- Six weeks in the air.
Only the Quinjet touched down.
- Is that a record for Zephyr One?
- It is.
It was supposed to be even longer.
- You know who called us in?
- I do.
You?
Okay.
Now I know something's up.
I got word from contacts in law enforcement, Los Angeles.
Two civilians were violently killed.
Mack:
Mysterious burns, heads bashed in, spine pulled out of his...
Wow.
Many conflicting accounts, but all agree... it was odd.
Odd?
Isn't that our wheelhouse?
He's right.
Why call us in?
We could be headed to the scene right now to confirm the presence of an enhanced person,
- if there is one.
- If it checks out, we bag and tag.
We handle these on the fly.
Didn't exactly want to send this out on the wire.
May, you're not sharing again.
Now would be a really good time to share.
The police also have another victim in custody.
Critical condition.
Under sedation, he mentioned seeing a girl, saying it was the one from the news.
Quake.
Which you didn't want to send over the wire.
You were pulled off Daisy's case.
The Director thinks she slipped through our fingers too many times.
The Director thinks you let her.
No, we pursued her.
She was a ghost.
Well, in his infinite wisdom, he says you're now forbidden to.
But you're telling us this because...?
In case we want to do something about it.
Look, I can bury this until the official police report comes through.
That'll buy us a few hours lead time.
Get to L.A., sniff around.
Yeah.
We have an active Inhuman asset in Los Angeles that's due for a check-in soon enough.
It'll justify our presence there, but as soon as the report's filed, they'll pull us out.
And the armed forces will be sent in after her.
With orders to kill.
- To kill?
- If she's responsible for these bodies.
- That's not Daisy's M.O.
- The world knows her as Quake, and Quake is an outlaw who takes down banks and bridges.
- Oh, come on.
We both know
- She's hunting violent radicals.
She's tracking these fanatics, the Watchdogs, trying to take down their funding, their... their escape routes.
Regardless, you should fuel up and get back up in the air ASAP.
Find her before the military does something bad.
Or Daisy does something worse.
[Monitors beeping]
Man:
Hey.
You can't be here.
Stop right there.
[Rumbling] [Screams]
How are we feeling today?
[Rumbling]
I've been tracking weapon sales, and I know you were hired to steal one.
You even jacked a big rig to help carry it out.
We were just paid for a smash-and-grab job.
Who was that hunting you?
[Grunts] Man:
Open the door!
He nailed me, but we almost got away.
Who was it?
- Did he kill my friends?
- All but one.
But you're gonna have to give me a little bit more if I'm gonna find him alive.
[Shuddered breathing]
Save him, please, before he gets burned, too.
You'll see your buddy again once you heal up.
- Just tell me what's...
- [Grunting] No.
No.
It's too late for me.
They say when the Rider burns you [breathing heavily] he burns your soul.
[Grunting]
And a soul can never heal.
[Grunting]
[Indistinct shouting]
[Rumbling]
Man:
Stop right there!
[Echoing] Hello?
Hello?
I hear my voice echo, but it sounds strange in my head.
The detail is amazing.
However, I am 3 feet off the ground.
Fitz:
Wait.
What?
Hold on.
Damn it.
Uh, well, I did adjust the Y axis earlier for some reason.
- What does that look like now?
- Better.
The CPU seems to be handling the high poly count.
Textures are impeccable.
We should build a place to get away... a meadow or a cottage somewhere.
[Sighs] I wish it were ever this quiet.
[Monitors beeping]
Direct-current stimulation.
Creates the other senses like touch and taste but also takes feedback.
So I've just mapped your brain's response...
Response to the environment.
Of course.
Dr. Radcliffe came up with the architecture?
Yeah.
Yeah, he calls it "The Framework."
But all the transcranial apparatus, that's all me.
No.
Of course, you're brilliant, too.
Of course.
'Cause soon you won't even need the eyewear or the earwear, 'cause it'll all be inside your head.
So May's strike team will be able to train virtually instead of May constantly breaking their ribs.
Nathanson:
Hey, hey.
Authorized personnel only, pal.
No pass, no entry.
- Who the hell are you?
- Leave them be, Nathanson.
They have more reason to be here than you do.
Wow.
A lot of new faces.
Good to see yours.
Six weeks.
That's a record.
- Heard you got a promotion.
- Oh, yeah, and a title.
Yeah, Special Advisor to the Director in Science and Technology.
Or "SADIST."
- They keeping you busy?
- With busywork, mostly.
Yeah, and random state-of-the-art lie-detector tests.
So that's the cost of being in the Director's inner circle.
Yeah, he's paranoid about what happened the last time S.H.I.E.L.D. was government-run.
Calls it his Widespread Infiltration Monitoring Program.
Or "WIMP." Hey, uh, you should join us 'cause we're gonna go to Radcliffe's and watch the
Aberdeen-Inverness Caley Thistle League cup final.
They're...
Those are football teams.
I'm not sure they are, Turbo.
Unfortunately, we have to be wheels-up in 10 minutes, so...
Okay.
All right.
Well, strictly business, then.
Aw, yeah.
New toys?
The exploding pen that you asked for.
I can't imagine a use for it.
You never wanted one?
[Chuckles]
And for you, Direct... uh, Agent Coulson with new bells and whistles.
And the directions will be there when you boot it up.
What's, uh...
What's the assignment?
[Sighs]
- It's classified.
- Right.
Everything is these days.
- Fitz, sadly, um...
- Yeah, you can't make the match, either.
- I have to finish my reports.
- Yeah, no, I get it.
That's okay.
Just a shame we hardly get to see each other.
- Any of us.
- [Sighs] Yes, well...
At least it's better than the friends we'll never see again.
[Sighs]
[Laptop beeps] [Music]
_
_ [Door closes]
[Breathing shakily]
We just stole a box.
I don't even know what was inside of it.
We...
We loaded it onto an 18-wheeler, we parked it in a warehouse, and we just left it.
Man:
Left it for who?
[Groans] The Chinatown Crew.
They set the job up and were willing to pay big.
[Grunts, groans]
Lies.
Aryan Brotherhood working with the Chinese?
I swear!
I swear that's all I know.
Where's this warehouse?
I...
I can't tell you that, man.
My people are gonna be mowed down in the payback... the ones you didn't already kill.
If you don't tell me, you'll have to tell him.
Coulson:
This guy's missing.
The rest are dead.
Aryan Brotherhood.
They're not my kind of brothers.
They've been know to work for cash.
Burglary, assault... sort of the value meal of hired guns.
They're suspected in the recent theft of this big rig.
- Probably prepping for a larger score.
- Big, yellow, hard to hide.
So, what, are we looking for this thing?
And if Daisy's chasing the same angle, maybe we get to the finish line first.
I'll greet her when she arrives.
- Davis:
Agent Coulson?
- Davis.
Preparing for decent.
Inhuman asset will be waiting on the tarmac.
[Tablet beeping]
What?
[Music]
- How's your wife, Davis?
- Getting bigger every day.
- Oh.
Don't tell her that.
- More beautiful every day.
[Chuckles]
There you go.
Mack.
Mack:
Yo-Yo.
[Sighs]
- Just have a few questions.
- I'm all yours.
Uh, so, I see you went to Colombia for a week.
Mm-hmm.
Mm.
And, uh, tickets to Miami coming up.
Yes.
Do you watch me sleep or shower or...?
Just procedure.
You don't have to use a satellite to get to know me better.
Just ask me to dinner again.
You know the rules about fraternizing with assets in the field. [Chuckles]
Oh, we haven't fraternized anything yet.
And I thought you were breaking the rules, coming to do my checkup early just to see me.
Or are you here because, uh, there's been a lot of little earthquakes lately?
Daisy could be in the area.
But officially, that's not the mission.
Doesn't matter.
We'll never find her.
She's always one step ahead.
What is the official mission?
Can I help?
Here's where I have to remind you that Sokovia Accords,
- which you signed...
- Oh, all right.
...require approval by the United Nations subcommittee...
- before an enhanced indiv...
- Rules, rules, rules.
Blah, blah, blah.
S.H.I.E.L.D. moves too slow now, Turtleman.
- I prefer to move fast.
- Uh...
Mack, they found the truck.
Good to see you, too, Coulson!
Well, if you're in Miami, look me up.
Just because we can't work together doesn't mean we can't live a little.
[Sighs]
[Crowd cheering on television]
[Doorbell rings]
Hey, just in time.
They've just taken to the pitch.
Where's Jemma?
Is she not coming?
Yeah, she wanted to.
Same story.
All work and no play, huh?
That's a bit disappointing.
Still, make yourself comfortable.
I'm just, uh, finishing cleaning up.
[Music]
Yeah, should be pretty lopsided, don't you think?
Their keeper's absolutely crap...
Oh, my gosh!
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I had no idea there was somebody here.
Hello.
[Sighs] You...
You weren't meant to see that.
Hello.
I'm glad to final...
- Hello.
I'm glad to final...
- Fitz, meet Aida.
- Hello.
I'm glad to final...
- She's, uh, crashed.
Hello.
I'm glad to final...
Hello.
I'm glad to final...
Hello.
I'm glad to final...
Hello.
I'm glad to final...
Hello.
I'm glad to final...
Hello.
I'm glad to final...
[Powers down]
[Remote beeping]
- What the hell?
- Well, I've just upped her PSU to compensate for image processing.
Must have overcranked it.
I'll reboot.
Unh-unh, that's not what I meant.
I meant...
- ...what the hell?
!
- Well, you've already met Aida, digital personal assistant, as a voice on the computer.
So, uh...
- I built her a body.
- Yeah, a naked body.
I-I was just now installing new hardware, updating her gyroscopic sensors.
I'm not some sicko.
When did you build this?
Have you forgotten the very strict stipulations that came with your pardon?
You are not allowed experimentation
- without approval and oversight!
- Oversight, I know.
I'm well aware of that, yeah.
That's why I wanted Simmons here.
I wanted to show both of you.
Look.
This has been a lifelong dream of mine, Fitz.
When I saw the work you and Simmons were doing in replicating human tissue and internal bone structure in Coulson's hand, I knew...
I knew right then that this was within reach.
- A robot?
- Not just a robot.
It's one that can cross the uncanny valley and come out the other side...
pass for a human.
I mean, it has bloody micro-expressions.
She.
It's a...
It's definitely a "she" 'cause I saw...
- Yes...
- She has micro-expressions, full range of motion.
I mean, physically, it's...
- she's nearly perfect.
- She is very realistic.
[Music]
Now, mentally, well, you've spoken with Aida.
She's bright, she laughs at the jokes
I programmed her to recognize, but she's never pass the Turing test.
At the moment, that's a pipe dream.
However, I think, with your help...
No, no.
No, no, no, no!
We have to report this right away.
- You could lose everything.
- I know.
- Or you could go to jail.
- I know!
I know, you're right.
Full disclosure at this time is the best course of action.
I...
I agree.
Hmm.
At least let me show you how it works.
[Air brakes hiss]
They're in town.
I supposed you guessed that, texting me.
They're looking for a truck.
That mean you have something for me?
They watch my every move, but certain moves they can't see.
You can't get these over the counter.
S.H.I.E.L.D. issue for rapid bone healing, yes?
I know you splintered your bones when you first powered up.
- Are you pushing yourself too hard?
- Don't worry about me.
You can't use your powers too much.
- Your body will break down.
- I'm fine.
I'm surprised you're still in town.
You're usually moving and moving.
Are you, uh, still hunting those perros rabiosos?
It's not just the Watchdogs now.
Local gangs have been working for them, which I... don't understand.
I was tracing the sale of a weapon, and I...
I think I may have stumbled upon a serial killer.
Ooh.
Fun.
He live around here?
He mostly hits this area, but he's hard to track down, leaves no traces behind, operates alone.
Sound familiar?
I thought maybe you were, uh, growing roots, they say.
- L.A. used to be where you hang out, no?
- No roots.
Everyone gets attached to something eventually.
Don't forget to wait two stops after I get off.
Yeah, yeah.
Hey.
Send me a picture of this guy.
Maybe I can cover some ground if I know what he looks like.
No, I still haven't gotten a good look at him yet, so just... take care of yourself, okay?
But thank you for the S.H.I.E.L.D. intel.
They won't give up on you, especially Coulson.
All he wants is to find you.
Well, that's too bad, 'cause there's only one thing I want.
Oh, yeah?
What's that?
Nothing to lose.
Here's the Mapping-Action Eyewear you requested.
Should help your team in case of a blind takedown.
- Great.
Thanks.
- I need you to sign for it.
I don't get the new color-coded security-level rainbow of...
- What's it called?
- The "Spectrum of Security."
Why do I, level red, have to go through you, level orange, to request hardware?
Shouldn't red be higher than orange?
Well, orange encompasses both red and yellow, so...
It's hard to explain, but the Director didn't want to use numbers because he didn't want any team member to feel less than.
Well, you do have a higher clearance than me.
Only in most instances.
I feel less than.
Hey, we just had a report come in.
A death in a hospital in Los Angeles.
Suspicious circumstances.
Suspect is an Asian female.
You think it might be Daisy.
I'm going to look into it.
I just wondered if you'd heard anything from your law-enforcement contacts?
I'm mostly in the dark these days.
Why don't you ask the Director?
Since you're one of the few people allowed or willing to do that.
[Spray-pain can rattles]
What you got there?
Didn't hear?
Word is, he hit again last night.
- Two dead in the street.
- Who?
Ghost Rider.
You must not be from around here.
Do you know where I can find him?
Nobody does.
Everybody that sees his face ends up on this wall.
"Everyone gets attached to something."
[Engine revs, tires screech]
Man:
We got to get this truck out of here.
What are you, the Feds?
Something like that.
We'll be sealing the scene.
Not for long, I hope.
I was just gonna have this guy tow this thing away so me and my crew can get back to work.
We got this.
Man:
This warehouse usually sits empty.
We were gonna store some inventory today.
Found the lock broken and this big, honkin' thing inside.
- Have at it.
- Coulson:
Thank you.
[Wrist beeps]
[Music]
Not fair.
You want tech like this, you should've cut off your own hand.
Mack.
Okay.
Mack:
Looks like these guys tore each other apart.
Zhang Wei, resident of Monterey Park.
Organ donor.
Say anything about him being a flesh-hungry rage monster?
Uh, no, I'm not seeing anything about that here, so we have to assume that he wasn't until he came in contact with whatever's in that trailer.
Not much here that'll lead us anywhere.
Well... there's that.
[Door slams]
[Keys rattling]
There was no buyer there.
[Car door closes]
[Engine starts, revs]
No, no, no.
No!
Please, God, no!
No!
I don't deserve to die!
- No!
No!
- Everyone says that.
No!
No!
No!
Diego:
Yeah, those chargers are hard to find.
Between "Fast and Furious" and "Dukes of Hazzard,"
they wrecked a lot of them.
My boyfriend wrecked his in a street race.
He's pretty broken up.
I guess he was more attached to it than I thought.
I ain't seen none around here, though.
- Sorry.
- All right.
Thanks, man.
Hey, uh, most of them wrecked movie cars, they're dumped at El Monte Junk and Salvage.
If your boyfriend wants to fix his ride up, might want to go over there and find scraps.
Thanks.
Maybe he'll go there.
Simmons:
Daisy's in Los Angeles.
There was an eyewitness, now dead, and I just received Yo-Yo's check-in report a week early, which means Coulson and Mack are there, too,
- no doubt, trying to track Daisy down.
- Sounds right.
You know it is, because according to the logs, you called Coulson back to H.Q. for resupply yourself.
Why, if not to give him that intel in person, knowing it's against the Director's orders?
I didn't send them.
I don't have the authority.
- They acted on their own.
- You knew I'd find out.
Why not tell me?
I have daily lie detection.
- That's why.
- And now I have to report it, which means now I either look like I'm incompetent
- or colluding with you.
- Wouldn't want you falling out of favor with the director.
[Sighs]
Okay.
I get it.
It's abundantly clear you're uncomfortable with my new position...
I just want to know how comfortable you are with it.
You actually trust this guy?
Our team split up to lead departments, given different colors.
'Cause we're experts?
No.
I think the Director broke up the band on purpose.
Of course he did!
[Sighs]
As soon as Talbot gave the location of this base to the president, things changed.
I knew we'd be divided, undermined, kept in the dark, so I have been clawing for as much power as I can possibly grab to keep a modicum of control over any of this.
After all we've been through...
[Sighs]
I don't trust the new Director, but he trusts me, so now, in order to keep that trust,
I must take the appropriate action to address this break in protocol.
I'm sending you and your strike team to take Coulson and Mack out of the field, by force, if necessary.
Clean up whatever mess he's in.
- That's an order.
- Yes, ma'am.
Mack:
Place them at the four corners of the exterior of the building.
That'll give us visuals through the walls.
Fitz:
This could be very dangerous.
- So much could go wrong.
- Ultron, yes.
I know.
But this is not A.I. A.I. is banned, and that's good.
This is mimicry of human behavior.
Still, in the wrong hands, this could be used as a weapon.
- Is that the idea?
- No, absolutely not.
No...
Look, I know the dangers.
That's why I've been...
I've been reticent to divulge.
I don't know these new people at S.H.I.E.L.D.
But a weapon is absolutely not the idea.
Well, then, why?
What's she for?
Why not let Aida tell you herself?
[Remote beeps] [Silent whir]
[Music]
Hello.
I'm glad to finally shake your hand, Leopold.
Where's Jemma?
We were hoping that she would come.
S-She's, uh... indisposed, I'm afraid.
Aida...
- I was wondering...
- Yes, Agent Fitz?
[Breathes deeply]
I was wondering if you could tell me exactly what it is you are designed for.
Of course.
Dr. Radcliffe, time and again, has expressed his deep regret for causing pain when all he ever wanted was to prevent it.
He speaks often of the pain that you and Agent Simmons have had to suffer, having lost so many friends...
Lincoln Campbell,
Andrew Garner, Antoine Triplett...
Okay, stop it, stop.
You don't have to list them.
Sorry.
The hope is that I will be able to prevent future tragedies... save the lives of agents by putting myself in harm's way in their place.
- To kill?
- No.
I am incapable of that.
I will protect.
I will serve as a decoy target, a safeguard...
- ...a shield.
- Okay.
T-Turn her off.
[Breathes deeply]
[Remote beeps] [Powers down]
[Sighs]
We can't tell Simmons about this.
What?
Don't we want to move forward?
Her approval is...
This is too dangerous to show the new Director.
We don't know what he'd do with it.
And she would have to tell him, so... she can't know.
- Not until...
- Until...?
Until she's perfect.
[Music]
[Music]
Coulson:
They're walking in now, six.
Really convivial-looking fellows.
At least four of them are packing.
Mack:
We should be tapped into surveillance now.
Let's see what we get.
[Tablet beeps]
Where are the other two men?
We had to leave them at the pick-up site.
Explain.
Those guys were transferring the box into the armored transport.
Maybe they peeked inside or something.
But they went berserk and tore into each other.
There was blood everywhere.
We put two bullets in each of them and locked them in the truck.
No, no.
Look, we were freaking out.
We had to get out of there!
Did you burn their bodies or dump the truck in the ocean?
Because if not, they can be traced back here.
They probably saw what was in this box and were fighting over it, you idiot!
I have been told it's powerful enough to bring our new enhanced enemies to their knees.
We get on comms and call the Zephyr for backup, headquarters will know we're on Daisy's trail.
No orders to pull out.
She's been tracking this sale.
- She could show up here any minute.
- I don't know.
Let's let this play out, see if anyone else makes an appearance.
[Music]
Daisy:
Excuse me.
Uh, the yard's closing.
To sell a junker, you can call the number on the gate.
Oh, no, I'm not here for that.
I, uh...
Uh, sorry.
What's your name?
Robbie.
Well, Robbie, I am looking for a guy with a sweet black '69 Charger.
Maybe he bought some parts here.
Sorry.
Doesn't ring a bell.
I only work nights once a week.
Uh, well, maybe I'll...
I'll come back in the morning.
Thank you.
Or... there's a book of sales you can flip through in the main office.
Not really an office.
More of a trailer, but I can show you.
That would be great, thank you.
[Men gasping]
[Tablet whirs] The hell...?
What was that?
A breath of fresh air.
[Ghostly shriek] [Gasps]
[Men grunting]
Get away from me!
That's it there.
- So, you live around here?
- No, I used to.
I'm just in town for a couple days, soaking up the sun.
Strange place to spend your vacation.
[Keys rattling]
Not a great neighborhood.
[Rumbling]
[Breathing heavily]
So... you've got the devil inside you, too.
What's going on, guys?
[Tablet whirs]
Call for backup, yeah?
We can't wait for Daisy.
These guys might kill somebody besides each other.
Yeah.
Us.
Z One, we got a situation.
We need a little help here.
[Gunshot]
That was efficient.
[Tablet beeps]
[Goggles beep, whir]
[Goggles beeping, whirring]
You guys know what to do.
[Music]
Damn.
May:
All clear.
[Fighting sounds] [Music]
[Rumbling]
You shouldn't have gotten involved.
Serial killers always complain when we try to intervene.
I only kill asesinos who deserve it.
It's vengeance, chica.
For what?
You killed a detective.
But he had blood on his hands.
- A teacher!
- A pedophile.
[Rumbling]
You don't get to decide who deserves to die.
I'm not the one who decides.
[Grunts]
[Music]
[Rumbling]
[Rumbling]
[Panting]
Do it. [Panting] I deserve it.
Do it.
[Grunts]
[Engine starts]
[Tires screech]
[Grunts]
[Music]
[Music stops]
[Brakes squeak]
Hey.
Thank for the ride, Janet.
You never accept rides.
Bus break down?
Or you still trying to holler at Janet's little sister?
Maybe.
I only needed a ride to help Canelo balance some books because my brother didn't finish high school.
Yo, I finished high school...
in the 11th grade.
[Chuckles]
"Everyone's attached to something."
[Engine starts]
[Indistinct conversations]
- Spent a lot of time in here?
- Too much.
My wallet's starting to get sick of it.
Your little side mission didn't go unnoticed.
Well, you showed up, so, yeah.
The Director will want to have words with you at H.Q.
[Chuckles]
[Sighs]
- No Daisy, huh?
- No.
But she was tracking these guys, so maybe this is a win.
I don't know.
The ground team is checking for contagion, but hopefully, whatever messed with these guys' heads is no longer an issue.
We're gonna analyze the box it came in.
It's good... to have a moment, just us.
It's been a long time since we had a moment alone.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
Just a long day.
Well, take advantage of the down time.
Who knows what tomorrow holds?
[Music] [Car engine revving]
[Gun cocks]
[Tires screeching, horn honks]
[Grunts] It's coming!
Get ready!
[Tires screeching] Go, man, go!
Aah!
Man:
Damn it!
Damn it!
Engine's dead!
[Tires screech]
Get it.
Kill it!
Shoot anything that moves.
[Breathing shakily]
[Rustling] [Firing]
Help.
He...
He got me.
He'll kill us all.
Give me that damn thing.
Get back!
[Gunfire, woman screaming]
[Engine revving in distance]
[Music]
[Tires screeching]
Man:
Shoot it!
Shoot it now!
[Gunfire]
[Screams]
[Panting]
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No, please!
No!
[Screams]
[Tires screeching]
[Sirens wail]
[Rumbling]
You need to sacrifice everything if you want to survive.
Hmm.
That's funny.
'Cause I thought I would just...
Mm.
Yeah, that's one way to go. [Sighs]
[Chuckles] Want a beer?
It's 6:00 in the morning.
What, are you Hemingway?
No, is that real?
When did we cross the North Pole?
An hour ago.
Oh, my gosh.
It's hard to keep track in this thing.
We shouldn't have to stay on clock when we're moving through time zones.
I mean, what is that...
three continents in two days?
If you count Berlin.
We were only there three hours.
Yeah, we knew that Inhuman call was a hoax as soon as we stepped foot in the apartment, saw that bong.
- I could smell it from the hallway.
- Jokers.
Hungry for attention.
And potato chips.
If the munchies was a superpower, they'd be signing the Sokovia Accords as we speak.
[Breathes deeply]
You should let me work on Lola.
I warned you.
Everything in Lola is custom.
Yeah, yeah, everything is custom.
But it would be something to do.
There's only so many times a guy can win cash off you... sir.
You got to stop calling me that.
- We're being called back to H.Q.
- They say why?
We're not due for a restock for another 10 days.
- No idea.
They said it's classified.
- Oh, everything is nowadays.
[Breathes deeply] All right, we'll need full inventory.
Medical, provisions, fuel cells, and make sure you tell the crew they'll need to call ahead if they want off our next deployment.
Agent Thompson...
- Wonder what that's about.
- Oh, I don't know.
- It'll be good to see Fitz and Simmons.
- And May.
Yeah...
I think you look forward to that more than I do.
Hyah!
What was his mistake?
[Music]
You know I'm not gonna talk.
He didn't anticipate your back kick.
Opened himself up.
His mistake was he tapped out.
[Motor whirring]
- Piper.
- Okay, people!
What, you never seen the biggest plane ever built before?
!
Next pairing, on the mat!
- How long has it been?
- Six weeks in the air.
Only the Quinjet touched down.
- Is that a record for Zephyr One?
- It is.
It was supposed to be even longer.
- You know who called us in?
- I do.
You?
Okay.
Now I know something's up.
I got word from contacts in law enforcement, Los Angeles.
Two civilians were violently killed.
Mack:
Mysterious burns, heads bashed in, spine pulled out of his...
Wow.
Many conflicting accounts, but all agree... it was odd.
Odd?
Isn't that our wheelhouse?
He's right.
Why call us in?
We could be headed to the scene right now to confirm the presence of an enhanced person,
- if there is one.
- If it checks out, we bag and tag.
We handle these on the fly.
Didn't exactly want to send this out on the wire.
May, you're not sharing again.
Now would be a really good time to share.
The police also have another victim in custody.
Critical condition.
Under sedation, he mentioned seeing a girl, saying it was the one from the news.
Quake.
Which you didn't want to send over the wire.
You were pulled off Daisy's case.
The Director thinks she slipped through our fingers too many times.
The Director thinks you let her.
No, we pursued her.
She was a ghost.
Well, in his infinite wisdom, he says you're now forbidden to.
But you're telling us this because...?
In case we want to do something about it.
Look, I can bury this until the official police report comes through.
That'll buy us a few hours lead time.
Get to L.A., sniff around.
Yeah.
We have an active Inhuman asset in Los Angeles that's due for a check-in soon enough.
It'll justify our presence there, but as soon as the report's filed, they'll pull us out.
And the armed forces will be sent in after her.
With orders to kill.
- To kill?
- If she's responsible for these bodies.
- That's not Daisy's M.O.
- The world knows her as Quake, and Quake is an outlaw who takes down banks and bridges.
- Oh, come on.
We both know
- She's hunting violent radicals.
She's tracking these fanatics, the Watchdogs, trying to take down their funding, their... their escape routes.
Regardless, you should fuel up and get back up in the air ASAP.
Find her before the military does something bad.
Or Daisy does something worse.
[Monitors beeping]
Man:
Hey.
You can't be here.
Stop right there.
[Rumbling] [Screams]
How are we feeling today?
[Rumbling]
I've been tracking weapon sales, and I know you were hired to steal one.
You even jacked a big rig to help carry it out.
We were just paid for a smash-and-grab job.
Who was that hunting you?
[Grunts] Man:
Open the door!
He nailed me, but we almost got away.
Who was it?
- Did he kill my friends?
- All but one.
But you're gonna have to give me a little bit more if I'm gonna find him alive.
[Shuddered breathing]
Save him, please, before he gets burned, too.
You'll see your buddy again once you heal up.
- Just tell me what's...
- [Grunting] No.
No.
It's too late for me.
They say when the Rider burns you [breathing heavily] he burns your soul.
[Grunting]
And a soul can never heal.
[Grunting]
[Indistinct shouting]
[Rumbling]
Man:
Stop right there!
[Echoing] Hello?
Hello?
I hear my voice echo, but it sounds strange in my head.
The detail is amazing.
However, I am 3 feet off the ground.
Fitz:
Wait.
What?
Hold on.
Damn it.
Uh, well, I did adjust the Y axis earlier for some reason.
- What does that look like now?
- Better.
The CPU seems to be handling the high poly count.
Textures are impeccable.
We should build a place to get away... a meadow or a cottage somewhere.
[Sighs] I wish it were ever this quiet.
[Monitors beeping]
Direct-current stimulation.
Creates the other senses like touch and taste but also takes feedback.
So I've just mapped your brain's response...
Response to the environment.
Of course.
Dr. Radcliffe came up with the architecture?
Yeah.
Yeah, he calls it "The Framework."
But all the transcranial apparatus, that's all me.
No.
Of course, you're brilliant, too.
Of course.
'Cause soon you won't even need the eyewear or the earwear, 'cause it'll all be inside your head.
So May's strike team will be able to train virtually instead of May constantly breaking their ribs.
Nathanson:
Hey, hey.
Authorized personnel only, pal.
No pass, no entry.
- Who the hell are you?
- Leave them be, Nathanson.
They have more reason to be here than you do.
Wow.
A lot of new faces.
Good to see yours.
Six weeks.
That's a record.
- Heard you got a promotion.
- Oh, yeah, and a title.
Yeah, Special Advisor to the Director in Science and Technology.
Or "SADIST."
- They keeping you busy?
- With busywork, mostly.
Yeah, and random state-of-the-art lie-detector tests.
So that's the cost of being in the Director's inner circle.
Yeah, he's paranoid about what happened the last time S.H.I.E.L.D. was government-run.
Calls it his Widespread Infiltration Monitoring Program.
Or "WIMP." Hey, uh, you should join us 'cause we're gonna go to Radcliffe's and watch the
Aberdeen-Inverness Caley Thistle League cup final.
They're...
Those are football teams.
I'm not sure they are, Turbo.
Unfortunately, we have to be wheels-up in 10 minutes, so...
Okay.
All right.
Well, strictly business, then.
Aw, yeah.
New toys?
The exploding pen that you asked for.
I can't imagine a use for it.
You never wanted one?
[Chuckles]
And for you, Direct... uh, Agent Coulson with new bells and whistles.
And the directions will be there when you boot it up.
What's, uh...
What's the assignment?
[Sighs]
- It's classified.
- Right.
Everything is these days.
- Fitz, sadly, um...
- Yeah, you can't make the match, either.
- I have to finish my reports.
- Yeah, no, I get it.
That's okay.
Just a shame we hardly get to see each other.
- Any of us.
- [Sighs] Yes, well...
At least it's better than the friends we'll never see again.
[Sighs]
[Laptop beeps] [Music]
_
_ [Door closes]
[Breathing shakily]
We just stole a box.
I don't even know what was inside of it.
We...
We loaded it onto an 18-wheeler, we parked it in a warehouse, and we just left it.
Man:
Left it for who?
[Groans] The Chinatown Crew.
They set the job up and were willing to pay big.
[Grunts, groans]
Lies.
Aryan Brotherhood working with the Chinese?
I swear!
I swear that's all I know.
Where's this warehouse?
I...
I can't tell you that, man.
My people are gonna be mowed down in the payback... the ones you didn't already kill.
If you don't tell me, you'll have to tell him.
Coulson:
This guy's missing.
The rest are dead.
Aryan Brotherhood.
They're not my kind of brothers.
They've been know to work for cash.
Burglary, assault... sort of the value meal of hired guns.
They're suspected in the recent theft of this big rig.
- Probably prepping for a larger score.
- Big, yellow, hard to hide.
So, what, are we looking for this thing?
And if Daisy's chasing the same angle, maybe we get to the finish line first.
I'll greet her when she arrives.
- Davis:
Agent Coulson?
- Davis.
Preparing for decent.
Inhuman asset will be waiting on the tarmac.
[Tablet beeping]
What?
[Music]
- How's your wife, Davis?
- Getting bigger every day.
- Oh.
Don't tell her that.
- More beautiful every day.
[Chuckles]
There you go.
Mack.
Mack:
Yo-Yo.
[Sighs]
- Just have a few questions.
- I'm all yours.
Uh, so, I see you went to Colombia for a week.
Mm-hmm.
Mm.
And, uh, tickets to Miami coming up.
Yes.
Do you watch me sleep or shower or...?
Just procedure.
You don't have to use a satellite to get to know me better.
Just ask me to dinner again.
You know the rules about fraternizing with assets in the field. [Chuckles]
Oh, we haven't fraternized anything yet.
And I thought you were breaking the rules, coming to do my checkup early just to see me.
Or are you here because, uh, there's been a lot of little earthquakes lately?
Daisy could be in the area.
But officially, that's not the mission.
Doesn't matter.
We'll never find her.
She's always one step ahead.
What is the official mission?
Can I help?
Here's where I have to remind you that Sokovia Accords,
- which you signed...
- Oh, all right.
...require approval by the United Nations subcommittee...
- before an enhanced indiv...
- Rules, rules, rules.
Blah, blah, blah.
S.H.I.E.L.D. moves too slow now, Turtleman.
- I prefer to move fast.
- Uh...
Mack, they found the truck.
Good to see you, too, Coulson!
Well, if you're in Miami, look me up.
Just because we can't work together doesn't mean we can't live a little.
[Sighs]
[Crowd cheering on television]
[Doorbell rings]
Hey, just in time.
They've just taken to the pitch.
Where's Jemma?
Is she not coming?
Yeah, she wanted to.
Same story.
All work and no play, huh?
That's a bit disappointing.
Still, make yourself comfortable.
I'm just, uh, finishing cleaning up.
[Music]
Yeah, should be pretty lopsided, don't you think?
Their keeper's absolutely crap...
Oh, my gosh!
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I had no idea there was somebody here.
Hello.
[Sighs] You...
You weren't meant to see that.
Hello.
I'm glad to final...
- Hello.
I'm glad to final...
- Fitz, meet Aida.
- Hello.
I'm glad to final...
- She's, uh, crashed.
Hello.
I'm glad to final...
Hello.
I'm glad to final...
Hello.
I'm glad to final...
Hello.
I'm glad to final...
Hello.
I'm glad to final...
Hello.
I'm glad to final...
[Powers down]
[Remote beeping]
- What the hell?
- Well, I've just upped her PSU to compensate for image processing.
Must have overcranked it.
I'll reboot.
Unh-unh, that's not what I meant.
I meant...
- ...what the hell?
!
- Well, you've already met Aida, digital personal assistant, as a voice on the computer.
So, uh...
- I built her a body.
- Yeah, a naked body.
I-I was just now installing new hardware, updating her gyroscopic sensors.
I'm not some sicko.
When did you build this?
Have you forgotten the very strict stipulations that came with your pardon?
You are not allowed experimentation
- without approval and oversight!
- Oversight, I know.
I'm well aware of that, yeah.
That's why I wanted Simmons here.
I wanted to show both of you.
Look.
This has been a lifelong dream of mine, Fitz.
When I saw the work you and Simmons were doing in replicating human tissue and internal bone structure in Coulson's hand, I knew...
I knew right then that this was within reach.
- A robot?
- Not just a robot.
It's one that can cross the uncanny valley and come out the other side...
pass for a human.
I mean, it has bloody micro-expressions.
She.
It's a...
It's definitely a "she" 'cause I saw...
- Yes...
- She has micro-expressions, full range of motion.
I mean, physically, it's...
- she's nearly perfect.
- She is very realistic.
[Music]
Now, mentally, well, you've spoken with Aida.
She's bright, she laughs at the jokes
I programmed her to recognize, but she's never pass the Turing test.
At the moment, that's a pipe dream.
However, I think, with your help...
No, no.
No, no, no, no!
We have to report this right away.
- You could lose everything.
- I know.
- Or you could go to jail.
- I know!
I know, you're right.
Full disclosure at this time is the best course of action.
I...
I agree.
Hmm.
At least let me show you how it works.
[Air brakes hiss]
They're in town.
I supposed you guessed that, texting me.
They're looking for a truck.
That mean you have something for me?
They watch my every move, but certain moves they can't see.
You can't get these over the counter.
S.H.I.E.L.D. issue for rapid bone healing, yes?
I know you splintered your bones when you first powered up.
- Are you pushing yourself too hard?
- Don't worry about me.
You can't use your powers too much.
- Your body will break down.
- I'm fine.
I'm surprised you're still in town.
You're usually moving and moving.
Are you, uh, still hunting those perros rabiosos?
It's not just the Watchdogs now.
Local gangs have been working for them, which I... don't understand.
I was tracing the sale of a weapon, and I...
I think I may have stumbled upon a serial killer.
Ooh.
Fun.
He live around here?
He mostly hits this area, but he's hard to track down, leaves no traces behind, operates alone.
Sound familiar?
I thought maybe you were, uh, growing roots, they say.
- L.A. used to be where you hang out, no?
- No roots.
Everyone gets attached to something eventually.
Don't forget to wait two stops after I get off.
Yeah, yeah.
Hey.
Send me a picture of this guy.
Maybe I can cover some ground if I know what he looks like.
No, I still haven't gotten a good look at him yet, so just... take care of yourself, okay?
But thank you for the S.H.I.E.L.D. intel.
They won't give up on you, especially Coulson.
All he wants is to find you.
Well, that's too bad, 'cause there's only one thing I want.
Oh, yeah?
What's that?
Nothing to lose.
Here's the Mapping-Action Eyewear you requested.
Should help your team in case of a blind takedown.
- Great.
Thanks.
- I need you to sign for it.
I don't get the new color-coded security-level rainbow of...
- What's it called?
- The "Spectrum of Security."
Why do I, level red, have to go through you, level orange, to request hardware?
Shouldn't red be higher than orange?
Well, orange encompasses both red and yellow, so...
It's hard to explain, but the Director didn't want to use numbers because he didn't want any team member to feel less than.
Well, you do have a higher clearance than me.
Only in most instances.
I feel less than.
Hey, we just had a report come in.
A death in a hospital in Los Angeles.
Suspicious circumstances.
Suspect is an Asian female.
You think it might be Daisy.
I'm going to look into it.
I just wondered if you'd heard anything from your law-enforcement contacts?
I'm mostly in the dark these days.
Why don't you ask the Director?
Since you're one of the few people allowed or willing to do that.
[Spray-pain can rattles]
What you got there?
Didn't hear?
Word is, he hit again last night.
- Two dead in the street.
- Who?
Ghost Rider.
You must not be from around here.
Do you know where I can find him?
Nobody does.
Everybody that sees his face ends up on this wall.
"Everyone gets attached to something."
[Engine revs, tires screech]
Man:
We got to get this truck out of here.
What are you, the Feds?
Something like that.
We'll be sealing the scene.
Not for long, I hope.
I was just gonna have this guy tow this thing away so me and my crew can get back to work.
We got this.
Man:
This warehouse usually sits empty.
We were gonna store some inventory today.
Found the lock broken and this big, honkin' thing inside.
- Have at it.
- Coulson:
Thank you.
[Wrist beeps]
[Music]
Not fair.
You want tech like this, you should've cut off your own hand.
Mack.
Okay.
Mack:
Looks like these guys tore each other apart.
Zhang Wei, resident of Monterey Park.
Organ donor.
Say anything about him being a flesh-hungry rage monster?
Uh, no, I'm not seeing anything about that here, so we have to assume that he wasn't until he came in contact with whatever's in that trailer.
Not much here that'll lead us anywhere.
Well... there's that.
[Door slams]
[Keys rattling]
There was no buyer there.
[Car door closes]
[Engine starts, revs]
No, no, no.
No!
Please, God, no!
No!
I don't deserve to die!
- No!
No!
- Everyone says that.
No!
No!
No!
Diego:
Yeah, those chargers are hard to find.
Between "Fast and Furious" and "Dukes of Hazzard,"
they wrecked a lot of them.
My boyfriend wrecked his in a street race.
He's pretty broken up.
I guess he was more attached to it than I thought.
I ain't seen none around here, though.
- Sorry.
- All right.
Thanks, man.
Hey, uh, most of them wrecked movie cars, they're dumped at El Monte Junk and Salvage.
If your boyfriend wants to fix his ride up, might want to go over there and find scraps.
Thanks.
Maybe he'll go there.
Simmons:
Daisy's in Los Angeles.
There was an eyewitness, now dead, and I just received Yo-Yo's check-in report a week early, which means Coulson and Mack are there, too,
- no doubt, trying to track Daisy down.
- Sounds right.
You know it is, because according to the logs, you called Coulson back to H.Q. for resupply yourself.
Why, if not to give him that intel in person, knowing it's against the Director's orders?
I didn't send them.
I don't have the authority.
- They acted on their own.
- You knew I'd find out.
Why not tell me?
I have daily lie detection.
- That's why.
- And now I have to report it, which means now I either look like I'm incompetent
- or colluding with you.
- Wouldn't want you falling out of favor with the director.
[Sighs]
Okay.
I get it.
It's abundantly clear you're uncomfortable with my new position...
I just want to know how comfortable you are with it.
You actually trust this guy?
Our team split up to lead departments, given different colors.
'Cause we're experts?
No.

I think the Director broke up the band on purpose.
Of course he did!
[Sighs]
As soon as Talbot gave the location of this base to the president, things changed.
I knew we'd be divided, undermined, kept in the dark, so I have been clawing for as much power as I can possibly grab to keep a modicum of control over any of this.
After all we've been through...
[Sighs]
I don't trust the new Director, but he trusts me, so now, in order to keep that trust,
I must take the appropriate action to address this break in protocol.
I'm sending you and your strike team to take Coulson and Mack out of the field, by force, if necessary.
Clean up whatever mess he's in.
- That's an order.
- Yes, ma'am.
Mack:
Place them at the four corners of the exterior of the building.
That'll give us visuals through the walls.
Fitz:
This could be very dangerous.
- So much could go wrong.
- Ultron, yes.
I know.
But this is not A.I. A.I. is banned, and that's good.
This is mimicry of human behavior.
Still, in the wrong hands, this could be used as a weapon.
- Is that the idea?
- No, absolutely not.
No...
Look, I know the dangers.
That's why I've been...
I've been reticent to divulge.
I don't know these new people at S.H.I.E.L.D.
But a weapon is absolutely not the idea.
Well, then, why?
What's she for?
Why not let Aida tell you herself?
[Remote beeps] [Silent whir]
[Music]
Hello.
I'm glad to finally shake your hand, Leopold.
Where's Jemma?
We were hoping that she would come.
S-She's, uh... indisposed, I'm afraid.
Aida...
- I was wondering...
- Yes, Agent Fitz?
[Breathes deeply]
I was wondering if you could tell me exactly what it is you are designed for.
Of course.
Dr. Radcliffe, time and again, has expressed his deep regret for causing pain when all he ever wanted was to prevent it.
He speaks often of the pain that you and Agent Simmons have had to suffer, having lost so many friends...
Lincoln Campbell,
Andrew Garner, Antoine Triplett...
Okay, stop it, stop.
You don't have to list them.
Sorry.
The hope is that I will be able to prevent future tragedies... save the lives of agents by putting myself in harm's way in their place.
- To kill?
- No.
I am incapable of that.
I will protect.
I will serve as a decoy target, a safeguard...
- ...a shield.
- Okay.
T-Turn her off.
[Breathes deeply]
[Remote beeps] [Powers down]
[Sighs]
We can't tell Simmons about this.
What?
Don't we want to move forward?
Her approval is...
This is too dangerous to show the new Director.
We don't know what he'd do with it.
And she would have to tell him, so... she can't know.
- Not until...
- Until...?
Until she's perfect.
[Music]
[Music]
Coulson:
They're walking in now, six.
Really convivial-looking fellows.
At least four of them are packing.
Mack:
We should be tapped into surveillance now.
Let's see what we get.
[Tablet beeps]
Where are the other two men?
We had to leave them at the pick-up site.
Explain.
Those guys were transferring the box into the armored transport.
Maybe they peeked inside or something.
But they went berserk and tore into each other.
There was blood everywhere.
We put two bullets in each of them and locked them in the truck.
No, no.
Look, we were freaking out.
We had to get out of there!
Did you burn their bodies or dump the truck in the ocean?
Because if not, they can be traced back here.
They probably saw what was in this box and were fighting over it, you idiot!
I have been told it's powerful enough to bring our new enhanced enemies to their knees.
We get on comms and call the Zephyr for backup, headquarters will know we're on Daisy's trail.
No orders to pull out.
She's been tracking this sale.
- She could show up here any minute.
- I don't know.
Let's let this play out, see if anyone else makes an appearance.
[Music]
Daisy:
Excuse me.
Uh, the yard's closing.
To sell a junker, you can call the number on the gate.
Oh, no, I'm not here for that.
I, uh...
Uh, sorry.
What's your name?
Robbie.
Well, Robbie, I am looking for a guy with a sweet black '69 Charger.
Maybe he bought some parts here.
Sorry.
Doesn't ring a bell.
I only work nights once a week.
Uh, well, maybe I'll...
I'll come back in the morning.
Thank you.
Or... there's a book of sales you can flip through in the main office.
Not really an office.
More of a trailer, but I can show you.
That would be great, thank you.
[Men gasping]
[Tablet whirs] The hell...?
What was that?
A breath of fresh air.
[Ghostly shriek] [Gasps]
[Men grunting]
Get away from me!
That's it there.
- So, you live around here?
- No, I used to.
I'm just in town for a couple days, soaking up the sun.
Strange place to spend your vacation.
[Keys rattling]
Not a great neighborhood.
[Rumbling]
[Breathing heavily]
So... you've got the devil inside you, too.
What's going on, guys?
[Tablet whirs]
Call for backup, yeah?
We can't wait for Daisy.
These guys might kill somebody besides each other.
Yeah.
Us.
Z One, we got a situation.
We need a little help here.
[Gunshot]
That was efficient.
[Tablet beeps]
[Goggles beep, whir]
[Goggles beeping, whirring]
You guys know what to do.
[Music]
Damn.
May:
All clear.
[Fighting sounds] [Music]
[Rumbling]
You shouldn't have gotten involved.
Serial killers always complain when we try to intervene.
I only kill asesinos who deserve it.
It's vengeance, chica.
For what?
You killed a detective.
But he had blood on his hands.
- A teacher!
- A pedophile.
[Rumbling]
You don't get to decide who deserves to die.
I'm not the one who decides.
[Grunts]
[Music]
[Rumbling]
[Rumbling]
[Panting]
Do it. [Panting] I deserve it.
Do it.
[Grunts]
[Engine starts]
[Tires screech]
[Grunts]
[Music]
[Music stops]
[Brakes squeak]
Hey.
Thank for the ride, Janet.
You never accept rides.
Bus break down?
Or you still trying to holler at Janet's little sister?
Maybe.
I only needed a ride to help Canelo balance some books because my brother didn't finish high school.
Yo, I finished high school...
in the 11th grade.
[Chuckles]
"Everyone's attached to something."
[Engine starts]
[Indistinct conversations]
- Spent a lot of time in here?
- Too much.
My wallet's starting to get sick of it.
Your little side mission didn't go unnoticed.
Well, you showed up, so, yeah.
The Director will want to have words with you at H.Q.
[Chuckles]
[Sighs]
- No Daisy, huh?
- No.
But she was tracking these guys, so maybe this is a win.
I don't know.
The ground team is checking for contagion, but hopefully, whatever messed with these guys' heads is no longer an issue.
We're gonna analyze the box it came in.
It's good... to have a moment, just us.
It's been a long time since we had a moment alone.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
Just a long day.
Well, take advantage of the down time.
Who knows what tomorrow holds?
It's coming!
Get ready!
Go, man, go!
Aah!
Damn it!
Damn it!
Engine's dead!
Get it.
Kill it!
Shoot anything that moves.
Help.
He...
He got me.
He'll kill us all.
Give me that damn thing.
Get back!
Shoot it!
Shoot it now!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No, please!
No!
4x01 - "The Ghost"
You need to sacrifice everything if you want to survive.
Hmm.
That's funny.
'Cause I thought I would just...
Mm.
Yeah, that's one way to go.
Want a beer?
It's 6:00 in the morning.
What, are you Hemingway?
No, is that real?
When did we cross the North Pole?
An hour ago.
Oh, my gosh.
It's hard to keep track in this thing.
We shouldn't have to stay on clock when we're moving through time zones.
I mean, what is that...
three continents in two days?
If you count Berlin.
We were only there three hours.
Yeah, we knew that Inhuman call was a hoax as soon as we stepped foot in the apartment, saw that bong.
- I could smell it from the hallway.
- Jokers.
Hungry for attention.
And potato chips.
If the munchies was a superpower, they'd be signing the Sokovia Accords as we speak.
You should let me work on Lola.
I warned you.
Everything in Lola is custom.
Yeah, yeah, everything is custom.
But it would be something to do.
There's only so many times a guy can win cash off you... sir.
You got to stop calling me that.
- We're being called back to H.Q.
- They say why?
We're not due for a restock for another 10 days.
- No idea.
They said it's classified.
- Oh, everything is nowadays.
All right, we'll need full inventory.
Medical, provisions, fuel cells, and make sure you tell the crew they'll need to call ahead if they want off our next deployment.
Agent Thompson...
- Wonder what that's about.
- Oh, I don't know.
- It'll be good to see Fitz and Simmons.
- And May.
Yeah...
I think you look forward to that more than I do.
Hyah!
What was his mistake?
You know I'm not gonna talk.
He didn't anticipate your back kick.
Opened himself up.
His mistake was he tapped out.
- Piper.
- Okay, people!
What, you never seen the biggest plane ever built before?
!
Next pairing, on the mat!
- How long has it been?
- Six weeks in the air.
Only the Quinjet touched down.
- Is that a record for Zephyr One?
- It is.
It was supposed to be even longer.
- You know who called us in?
- I do.
You?
Okay.
Now I know something's up.
I got word from contacts in law enforcement, Los Angeles.
Two civilians were violently killed.
Mysterious burns, heads bashed in, spine pulled out of his...
Wow.
Many conflicting accounts, but all agree... it was odd.
Odd?
Isn't that our wheelhouse?
He's right.
Why call us in?
We could be headed to the scene right now to confirm the presence of an enhanced person,
- if there is one.
- If it checks out, we bag and tag.
We handle these on the fly.
Didn't exactly want to send this out on the wire.
May, you're not sharing again.
Now would be a really good time to share.
The police also have another victim in custody.
Critical condition.
Under sedation, he mentioned seeing a girl, saying it was the one from the news.
Quake.
Which you didn't want to send over the wire.
You were pulled off Daisy's case.
The Director thinks she slipped through our fingers too many times.
The Director thinks you let her.
No, we pursued her.
She was a ghost.
Well, in his infinite wisdom, he says you're now forbidden to.
But you're telling us this because...?
In case we want to do something about it.
Look, I can bury this until the official police report comes through.
That'll buy us a few hours lead time.
Get to L.A., sniff around.
Yeah.
We have an active Inhuman asset in Los Angeles that's due for a check-in soon enough.
It'll justify our presence there, but as soon as the report's filed, they'll pull us out.
And the armed forces will be sent in after her.
With orders to kill.
- To kill?
- If she's responsible for these bodies.
- That's not Daisy's M.O.
- The world knows her as Quake, and Quake is an outlaw who takes down banks and bridges.
- Oh, come on.
We both know
- She's hunting violent radicals.
She's tracking these fanatics, the Watchdogs, trying to take down their funding, their... their escape routes.
Regardless, you should fuel up and get back up in the air ASAP.
Find her before the military does something bad.
Or Daisy does something worse.
Hey.
You can't be here.
Stop right there.
How are we feeling today?
I've been tracking weapon sales, and I know you were hired to steal one.
You even jacked a big rig to help carry it out.
We were just paid for a smash-and-grab job.
Who was that hunting you?
Open the door!
He nailed me, but we almost got away.
Who was it?
- Did he kill my friends?
- All but one.
But you're gonna have to give me a little bit more if I'm gonna find him alive.
Save him, please, before he gets burned, too.
You'll see your buddy again once you heal up.
- Just tell me what's...
- No.
No.
It's too late for me.
They say when the Rider burns you he burns your soul.
And a soul can never heal.
Stop right there!
Hello?
Hello?
I hear my voice echo, but it sounds strange in my head.
The detail is amazing.
However, I am 3 feet off the ground.
Wait.
What?
Hold on.
Damn it.
Uh, well, I did adjust the Y axis earlier for some reason.
- What does that look like now?
- Better.
The CPU seems to be handling the high poly count.
Textures are impeccable.
We should build a place to get away... a meadow or a cottage somewhere.
I wish it were ever this quiet.
Direct-current stimulation.
Creates the other senses like touch and taste but also takes feedback.
So I've just mapped your brain's response...
Response to the environment.
Of course.
Dr. Radcliffe came up with the architecture?
Yeah.
Yeah, he calls it "The Framework."
But all the transcranial apparatus, that's all me.
No.
Of course, you're brilliant, too.
Of course.
'Cause soon you won't even need the eyewear or the earwear, 'cause it'll all be inside your head.
So May's strike team will be able to train virtually instead of May constantly breaking their ribs.
Hey, hey.
Authorized personnel only, pal.
No pass, no entry.
- Who the hell are you?
- Leave them be, Nathanson.
They have more reason to be here than you do.
Wow.
A lot of new faces.
Good to see yours.
Six weeks.
That's a record.
- Heard you got a promotion.
- Oh, yeah, and a title.
Yeah, Special Advisor to the Director in Science and Technology.
Or "SADIST."
- They keeping you busy?
- With busywork, mostly.
Yeah, and random state-of-the-art lie-detector tests.
So that's the cost of being in the Director's inner circle.
Yeah, he's paranoid about what happened the last time S.H.I.E.L.D. was government-run.
Calls it his Widespread Infiltration Monitoring Program.
Or "WIMP." Hey, uh, you should join us 'cause we're gonna go to Radcliffe's and watch the
Aberdeen-Inverness Caley Thistle League cup final.
They're...
Those are football teams.
I'm not sure they are, Turbo.
Unfortunately, we have to be wheels-up in 10 minutes, so...
Okay.
All right.
Well, strictly business, then.
Aw, yeah.
New toys?
The exploding pen that you asked for.
I can't imagine a use for it.
You never wanted one?
And for you, Direct... uh, Agent Coulson with new bells and whistles.
And the directions will be there when you boot it up.
What's, uh...
What's the assignment?
- It's classified.
- Right.
Everything is these days.
- Fitz, sadly, um...
- Yeah, you can't make the match, either.
- I have to finish my reports.
- Yeah, no, I get it.
That's okay.
Just a shame we hardly get to see each other.
- Any of us.
- Yes, well...
At least it's better than the friends we'll never see again.
_
_
We just stole a box.
I don't even know what was inside of it.
We...
We loaded it onto an 18-wheeler, we parked it in a warehouse, and we just left it.
Left it for who?
The Chinatown Crew.
They set the job up and were willing to pay big.
Lies.
Aryan Brotherhood working with the Chinese?
I swear!
I swear that's all I know.
Where's this warehouse?
I...
I can't tell you that, man.
My people are gonna be mowed down in the payback... the ones you didn't already kill.
If you don't tell me, you'll have to tell him.
This guy's missing.
The rest are dead.
Aryan Brotherhood.
They're not my kind of brothers.
They've been know to work for cash.
Burglary, assault... sort of the value meal of hired guns.
They're suspected in the recent theft of this big rig.
- Probably prepping for a larger score.
- Big, yellow, hard to hide.
So, what, are we looking for this thing?
And if Daisy's chasing the same angle, maybe we get to the finish line first.
I'll greet her when she arrives.
- Agent Coulson?
- Davis.
Preparing for decent.
Inhuman asset will be waiting on the tarmac.
What?
- How's your wife, Davis?
- Getting bigger every day.
- Oh.
Don't tell her that.
- More beautiful every day.
There you go.
Mack.
Yo-Yo.
- Just have a few questions.
- I'm all yours.
Uh, so, I see you went to Colombia for a week.
Mm-hmm.
Mm.
And, uh, tickets to Miami coming up.
Yes.
Do you watch me sleep or shower or...?
Just procedure.
You don't have to use a satellite to get to know me better.
Just ask me to dinner again.
You know the rules about fraternizing with assets in the field.
Oh, we haven't fraternized anything yet.
And I thought you were breaking the rules, coming to do my checkup early just to see me.
Or are you here because, uh, there's been a lot of little earthquakes lately?
Daisy could be in the area.
But officially, that's not the mission.
Doesn't matter.
We'll never find her.
She's always one step ahead.
What is the official mission?
Can I help?
Here's where I have to remind you that Sokovia Accords,
- which you signed...
- Oh, all right.
...require approval by the United Nations subcommittee...
- before an enhanced indiv...
- Rules, rules, rules.
Blah, blah, blah.
S.H.I.E.L.D. moves too slow now, Turtleman.
- I prefer to move fast.
- Uh...
Mack, they found the truck.
Good to see you, too, Coulson!
Well, if you're in Miami, look me up.
Just because we can't work together doesn't mean we can't live a little.
Hey, just in time.
They've just taken to the pitch.
Where's Jemma?
Is she not coming?
Yeah, she wanted to.
Same story.
All work and no play, huh?
That's a bit disappointing.
Still, make yourself comfortable.
I'm just, uh, finishing cleaning up.
Yeah, should be pretty lopsided, don't you think?
Their keeper's absolutely crap...
Oh, my gosh!
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I had no idea there was somebody here.
Hello.
You...
You weren't meant to see that.
Hello.
I'm glad to final...
- Hello.
I'm glad to final...
- Fitz, meet Aida.
- Hello.
I'm glad to final...
- She's, uh, crashed.
Hello.
I'm glad to final...
Hello.
I'm glad to final...
Hello.
I'm glad to final...
Hello.
I'm glad to final...
Hello.
I'm glad to final...
Hello.
I'm glad to final...
- What the hell?
- Well, I've just upped her PSU to compensate for image processing.
Must have overcranked it.
I'll reboot.
Unh-unh, that's not what I meant.
I meant...
- ...what the hell?
!
- Well, you've already met Aida, digital personal assistant, as a voice on the computer.
So, uh...
- I built her a body.
- Yeah, a naked body.
I-I was just now installing new hardware, updating her gyroscopic sensors.
I'm not some sicko.
When did you build this?
Have you forgotten the very strict stipulations that came with your pardon?
You are not allowed experimentation
- without approval and oversight!
- Oversight, I know.
I'm well aware of that, yeah.
That's why I wanted Simmons here.
I wanted to show both of you.
Look.
This has been a lifelong dream of mine, Fitz.
When I saw the work you and Simmons were doing in replicating human tissue and internal bone structure in Coulson's hand, I knew...
I knew right then that this was within reach.
- A robot?
- Not just a robot.
It's one that can cross the uncanny valley and come out the other side...
pass for a human.
I mean, it has bloody micro-expressions.
She.
It's a...
It's definitely a "she" 'cause I saw...
- Yes...
- She has micro-expressions, full range of motion.
I mean, physically, it's...
- she's nearly perfect.
- She is very realistic.
Now, mentally, well, you've spoken with Aida.
She's bright, she laughs at the jokes
I programmed her to recognize, but she's never pass the Turing test.
At the moment, that's a pipe dream.
However, I think, with your help...
No, no.
No, no, no, no!
We have to report this right away.
- You could lose everything.
- I know.
- Or you could go to jail.
- I know!
I know, you're right.
Full disclosure at this time is the best course of action.
I...
I agree.
Hmm.
At least let me show you how it works.
They're in town.
I supposed you guessed that, texting me.
They're looking for a truck.
That mean you have something for me?
They watch my every move, but certain moves they can't see.
You can't get these over the counter.
S.H.I.E.L.D. issue for rapid bone healing, yes?
I know you splintered your bones when you first powered up.
- Are you pushing yourself too hard?
- Don't worry about me.
You can't use your powers too much.
- Your body will break down.
- I'm fine.
I'm surprised you're still in town.
You're usually moving and moving.
Are you, uh, still hunting those perros rabiosos?
It's not just the Watchdogs now.
Local gangs have been working for them, which I... don't understand.
I was tracing the sale of a weapon, and I...
I think I may have stumbled upon a serial killer.
Ooh.
Fun.
He live around here?
He mostly hits this area, but he's hard to track down, leaves no traces behind, operates alone.
Sound familiar?
I thought maybe you were, uh, growing roots, they say.
- L.A. used to be where you hang out, no?
- No roots.
Everyone gets attached to something eventually.
Don't forget to wait two stops after I get off.
Yeah, yeah.
Hey.
Send me a picture of this guy.
Maybe I can cover some ground if I know what he looks like.
No, I still haven't gotten a good look at him yet, so just...
take care of yourself, okay?
But thank you for the S.H.I.E.L.D. intel.
They won't give up on you, especially Coulson.
All he wants is to find you.
Well, that's too bad, 'cause there's only one thing I want.
Oh, yeah?
What's that?
Nothing to lose.
Here's the Mapping-Action Eyewear you requested.
Should help your team in case of a blind takedown.
- Great.
Thanks.
- I need you to sign for it.
I don't get the new color-coded security-level rainbow of...
- What's it called?
- The "Spectrum of Security."
Why do I, level red, have to go through you, level orange, to request hardware?
Shouldn't red be higher than orange?
Well, orange encompasses both red and yellow, so...
It's hard to explain, but the Director didn't want to use numbers because he didn't want any team member to feel less than.
Well, you do have a higher clearance than me.
Only in most instances.
I feel less than.
Hey, we just had a report come in.
A death in a hospital in Los Angeles.
Suspicious circumstances.
Suspect is an Asian female.
You think it might be Daisy.
I'm going to look into it.
I just wondered if you'd heard anything from your law-enforcement contacts?
I'm mostly in the dark these days.
Why don't you ask the Director?
Since you're one of the few people allowed or willing to do that.
What you got there?
Didn't hear?
Word is, he hit again last night.
- Two dead in the street.
- Who?
Ghost Rider.
You must not be from around here.
Do you know where I can find him?
Nobody does.
Everybody that sees his face ends up on this wall.
"Everyone gets attached to something."
We got to get this truck out of here.
What are you, the Feds?
Something like that.
We'll be sealing the scene.
Not for long, I hope.
I was just gonna have this guy tow this thing away so me and my crew can get back to work.
We got this.
This warehouse usually sits empty.
We were gonna store some inventory today.
Found the lock broken and this big, honkin' thing inside.
- Have at it.
- Thank you.
Not fair.
You want tech like this, you should've cut off your own hand.
Mack.
Okay.
Looks like these guys tore each other apart.
Zhang Wei, resident of Monterey Park.
Organ donor.
Say anything about him being a flesh-hungry rage monster?
Uh, no, I'm not seeing anything about that here, so we have to assume that he wasn't until he came in contact with whatever's in that trailer.
Not much here that'll lead us anywhere.
Well... there's that.
There was no buyer there.
No, no, no.
No!
Please, God, no!
No!
I don't deserve to die!
- No!
No!
- Everyone says that.
No!
No!
No!
Yeah, those chargers are hard to find.
Between "Fast and Furious" and "Dukes of Hazzard,"
they wrecked a lot of them.
My boyfriend wrecked his in a street race.
He's pretty broken up.
I guess he was more attached to it than I thought.
I ain't seen none around here, though.
- Sorry.
- All right.
Thanks, man.
Hey, uh, most of them wrecked movie cars, they're dumped at El Monte Junk and Salvage.
If your boyfriend wants to fix his ride up, might want to go over there and find scraps.
Thanks.
Maybe he'll go there.
Daisy's in Los Angeles.
There was an eyewitness, now dead, and I just received Yo-Yo's check-in report a week early, which means Coulson and Mack are there, too,
- no doubt, trying to track Daisy down.
- Sounds right.
You know it is, because according to the logs, you called Coulson back to H.Q. for resupply yourself.
Why, if not to give him that intel in person, knowing it's against the Director's orders?
I didn't send them.
I don't have the authority.
- They acted on their own.
- You knew I'd find out.
Why not tell me?
I have daily lie detection.
- That's why.
- And now I have to report it, which means now I either look like I'm incompetent
- or colluding with you.
- Wouldn't want you falling out of favor with the director.
Okay.
I get it.
It's abundantly clear you're uncomfortable with my new position...
I just want to know how comfortable you are with it.
You actually trust this guy?
Our team split up to lead departments, given different colors.
'Cause we're experts?
No.
I think the Director broke up the band on purpose.
Of course he did!
As soon as Talbot gave the location of this base to the president, things changed.
I knew we'd be divided, undermined, kept in the dark, so I have been clawing for as much power as I can possibly grab to keep a modicum of control over any of this.
After all we've been through...
I don't trust the new Director, but he trusts me, so now, in order to keep that trust,
I must take the appropriate action to address this break in protocol.
I'm sending you and your strike team to take Coulson and Mack out of the field, by force, if necessary.
Clean up whatever mess he's in.
- That's an order.
- Yes, ma'am.
Place them at the four corners of the exterior of the building.
That'll give us visuals through the walls.
This could be very dangerous.
- So much could go wrong.
- Ultron, yes.
I know.
But this is not A.I. A.I. is banned, and that's good.
This is mimicry of human behavior.
Still, in the wrong hands, this could be used as a weapon.
- Is that the idea?
- No, absolutely not.
No...
Look, I know the dangers.
That's why I've been...
I've been reticent to divulge.
I don't know these new people at S.H.I.E.L.D.
But a weapon is absolutely not the idea.
Well, then, why?
What's she for?
Why not let Aida tell you herself?
Hello.
I'm glad to finally shake your hand, Leopold.
Where's Jemma?
We were hoping that she would come.
S-She's, uh...
indisposed, I'm afraid.
Aida...
- I was wondering...
- Yes, Agent Fitz?
I was wondering if you could tell me exactly what it is you are designed for.
Of course.
Dr. Radcliffe, time and again, has expressed his deep regret for causing pain when all he ever wanted was to prevent it.
He speaks often of the pain that you and Agent Simmons have had to suffer, having lost so many friends...
Lincoln Campbell,
Andrew Garner, Antoine Triplett...
Okay, stop it, stop.
You don't have to list them.
Sorry.
The hope is that I will be able to prevent future tragedies... save the lives of agents by putting myself in harm's way in their place.
- To kill?
- No.
I am incapable of that.
I will protect.
I will serve as a decoy target, a safeguard...
- ...a shield.
- Okay.
T-Turn her off.
We can't tell Simmons about this.
What?
Don't we want to move forward?
Her approval is...
This is too dangerous to show the new Director.
We don't know what he'd do with it.
And she would have to tell him, so... she can't know.
- Not until...
- Until...?
Until she's perfect.
They're walking in now, six.
Really convivial-looking fellows.
At least four of them are packing.
We should be tapped into surveillance now.
Let's see what we get.
Where are the other two men?
We had to leave them at the pick-up site.
Explain.
Those guys were transferring the box into the armored transport.
Maybe they peeked inside or something.
But they went berserk and tore into each other.
There was blood everywhere.
We put two bullets in each of them and locked them in the truck.
No, no.
Look, we were freaking out.
We had to get out of there!
Did you burn their bodies or dump the truck in the ocean?
Because if not, they can be traced back here.
They probably saw what was in this box and were fighting over it, you idiot!
I have been told it's powerful enough to bring our new enhanced enemies to their knees.
We get on comms and call the Zephyr for backup, headquarters will know we're on Daisy's trail.
No orders to pull out.
She's been tracking this sale.
- She could show up here any minute.
- I don't know.
Let's let this play out, see if anyone else makes an appearance.
Excuse me.
Uh, the yard's closing.
To sell a junker, you can call the number on the gate.
Oh, no, I'm not here for that.
I, uh...
Uh, sorry.
What's your name?
Robbie.
Well, Robbie, I am looking for a guy with a sweet black '69 Charger.
Maybe he bought some parts here.
Sorry.
Doesn't ring a bell.
I only work nights once a week.
Uh, well, maybe I'll...
I'll come back in the morning.
Thank you.
Or...
there's a book of sales you can flip through in the main office.
Not really an office.
More of a trailer, but I can show you.
That would be great, thank you.
The hell...?
What was that?
A breath of fresh air.
Get away from me!
That's it there.
- So, you live around here?
- No, I used to.
I'm just in town for a couple days, soaking up the sun.
Strange place to spend your vacation.
Not a great neighborhood.
So... you've got the devil inside you, too.
What's going on, guys?
Call for backup, yeah?
We can't wait for Daisy.
These guys might kill somebody besides each other.
Yeah.
Us.
Z One, we got a situation.
We need a little help here.
That was efficient.
You guys know what to do.
Damn.
All clear.
You shouldn't have gotten involved.
Serial killers always complain when we try to intervene.
I only kill asesinos who deserve it.
It's vengeance, chica.
For what?
You killed a detective.
But he had blood on his hands.
- A teacher!
- A pedophile.
You don't get to decide who deserves to die.
I'm not the one who decides.
Do it.
I deserve it.
Do it.
Hey.
Thank for the ride, Janet.
You never accept rides.
Bus break down?
Or you still trying to holler at Janet's little sister?
Maybe.
I only needed a ride to help Canelo balance some books because my brother didn't finish high school.
Yo, I finished high school...
in the 11th grade.
"Everyone's attached to something."
- Spent a lot of time in here?
- Too much.
My wallet's starting to get sick of it.
Your little side mission didn't go unnoticed.
Well, you showed up, so, yeah.
The Director will want to have words with you at H.Q.
- No Daisy, huh?
- No.
But she was tracking these guys, so maybe this is a win.
I don't know.
The ground team is checking for contagion, but hopefully, whatever messed with these guys' heads is no longer an issue.
We're gonna analyze the box it came in.
It's good...
to have a moment, just us.
It's been a long time since we had a moment alone.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
Just a long day.
Well, take advantage of the down time.
Who knows what tomorrow holds?
[Music] [Car engine revving]
[Gun cocks]
[Tires screeching, horn honks]
[Grunts] It's coming!
Get ready!
[Tires screeching] Go, man, go!
Aah!
Man:
Damn it!
Damn it!
Engine's dead!
[Tires screech]
Get it.
Kill it!
Shoot anything that moves.
[Breathing shakily]
[Rustling] [Firing]
Help.
He...
He got me.
He'll kill us all.
Give me that damn thing.
Get back!
[Gunfire, woman screaming]
[Engine revving in distance]
[Music]
[Tires screeching]
Man:
Shoot it!
Shoot it now!
[Gunfire]
[Screams]
[Panting]
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No, please!
No!
[Screams]
[Tires screeching]
[Sirens wail]
[Rumbling]
4x01 - "The Ghost"
You need to sacrifice everything if you want to survive.
Hmm.
That's funny.
'Cause I thought I would just...
Mm.
Yeah, that's one way to go. [Sighs]
[Chuckles] Want a beer?
It's 6:00 in the morning.
What, are you Hemingway?
No, is that real?
When did we cross the North Pole?
An hour ago.
Oh, my gosh.
It's hard to keep track in this thing.
We shouldn't have to stay on clock when we're moving through time zones.
I mean, what is that...
three continents in two days?
If you count Berlin.
We were only there three hours.
Yeah, we knew that Inhuman call was a hoax as soon as we stepped foot in the apartment, saw that bong.
- I could smell it from the hallway.
- Jokers.
Hungry for attention.
And potato chips.
If the munchies was a superpower, they'd be signing the Sokovia Accords as we speak.
[Breathes deeply]
You should let me work on Lola.
I warned you.
Everything in Lola is custom.
Yeah, yeah, everything is custom.
But it would be something to do.
There's only so many times a guy can win cash off you... sir.
You got to stop calling me that.
- We're being called back to H.Q.
- They say why?
We're not due for a restock for another 10 days.
- No idea.
They said it's classified.
- Oh, everything is nowadays.
[Breathes deeply] All right, we'll need full inventory.
Medical, provisions, fuel cells, and make sure you tell the crew they'll need to call ahead if they want off our next deployment.
Agent Thompson...
- Wonder what that's about.
- Oh, I don't know.
- It'll be good to see Fitz and Simmons.
- And May.
Yeah...
I think you look forward to that more than I do.
Hyah!
What was his mistake?
[Music]
You know I'm not gonna talk.
He didn't anticipate your back kick.
Opened himself up.
His mistake was he tapped out.
[Motor whirring]
- Piper.
- Okay, people!
What, you never seen the biggest plane ever built before?
!
Next pairing, on the mat!
- How long has it been?
- Six weeks in the air.
Only the Quinjet touched down.
- Is that a record for Zephyr One?
- It is.
It was supposed to be even longer.
- You know who called us in?
- I do.
You?
Okay.
Now I know something's up.
I got word from contacts in law enforcement, Los Angeles.
Two civilians were violently killed.
Mack:
Mysterious burns, heads bashed in, spine pulled out of his...
Wow.
Many conflicting accounts, but all agree... it was odd.
Odd?
Isn't that our wheelhouse?
He's right.
Why call us in?
We could be headed to the scene right now to confirm the presence of an enhanced person,
- if there is one.
- If it checks out, we bag and tag.
We handle these on the fly.
Didn't exactly want to send this out on the wire.
May, you're not sharing again.
Now would be a really good time to share.
The police also have another victim in custody.
Critical condition.
Under sedation, he mentioned seeing a girl, saying it was the one from the news.
Quake.
Which you didn't want to send over the wire.
You were pulled off Daisy's case.
The Director thinks she slipped through our fingers too many times.
The Director thinks you let her.
No, we pursued her.
She was a ghost.
Well, in his infinite wisdom, he says you're now forbidden to.
But you're telling us this because...?
In case we want to do something about it.
Look, I can bury this until the official police report comes through.
That'll buy us a few hours lead time.
Get to L.A., sniff around.
Yeah.
We have an active Inhuman asset in Los Angeles that's due for a check-in soon enough.
It'll justify our presence there, but as soon as the report's filed, they'll pull us out.
And the armed forces will be sent in after her.
With orders to kill.
- To kill?
- If she's responsible for these bodies.
- That's not Daisy's M.O.
- The world knows her as Quake, and Quake is an outlaw who takes down banks and bridges.
- Oh, come on.
We both know
- She's hunting violent radicals.
She's tracking these fanatics, the Watchdogs, trying to take down their funding, their... their escape routes.
Regardless, you should fuel up and get back up in the air ASAP.
Find her before the military does something bad.
Or Daisy does something worse.
[Monitors beeping]
Man:
Hey.
You can't be here.
Stop right there.
[Rumbling] [Screams]
How are we feeling today?
[Rumbling]
I've been tracking weapon sales, and I know you were hired to steal one.
You even jacked a big rig to help carry it out.
We were just paid for a smash-and-grab job.
Who was that hunting you?
[Grunts] Man:
Open the door!
He nailed me, but we almost got away.
Who was it?
- Did he kill my friends?
- All but one.
But you're gonna have to give me a little bit more if I'm gonna find him alive.
[Shuddered breathing]
Save him, please, before he gets burned, too.
You'll see your buddy again once you heal up.
- Just tell me what's...
- [Grunting] No.
No.
It's too late for me.
They say when the Rider burns you [breathing heavily] he burns your soul.
[Grunting]
And a soul can never heal.
[Grunting]
[Indistinct shouting]
[Rumbling]
Man:
Stop right there!
[Echoing] Hello?
Hello?
I hear my voice echo, but it sounds strange in my head.
The detail is amazing.
However, I am 3 feet off the ground.
Fitz:
Wait.
What?
Hold on.
Damn it.
Uh, well, I did adjust the Y axis earlier for some reason.
- What does that look like now?
- Better.
The CPU seems to be handling the high poly count.
Textures are impeccable.
We should build a place to get away... a meadow or a cottage somewhere.
[Sighs] I wish it were ever this quiet.
[Monitors beeping]
Direct-current stimulation.
Creates the other senses like touch and taste but also takes feedback.
So I've just mapped your brain's response...
Response to the environment.
Of course.
Dr. Radcliffe came up with the architecture?
Yeah.
Yeah, he calls it "The Framework."
But all the transcranial apparatus, that's all me.
No.
Of course, you're brilliant, too.
Of course.
'Cause soon you won't even need the eyewear or the earwear, 'cause it'll all be inside your head.
So May's strike team will be able to train virtually instead of May constantly breaking their ribs.
Nathanson:
Hey, hey.
Authorized personnel only, pal.
No pass, no entry.
- Who the hell are you?
- Leave them be, Nathanson.
They have more reason to be here than you do.
Wow.
A lot of new faces.
Good to see yours.
Six weeks.
That's a record.
- Heard you got a promotion.
- Oh, yeah, and a title.
Yeah, Special Advisor to the Director in Science and Technology.
Or "SADIST."
- They keeping you busy?
- With busywork, mostly.
Yeah, and random state-of-the-art lie-detector tests.
So that's the cost of being in the Director's inner circle.
Yeah, he's paranoid about what happened the last time S.H.I.E.L.D. was government-run.
Calls it his Widespread Infiltration Monitoring Program.
Or "WIMP." Hey, uh, you should join us 'cause we're gonna go to Radcliffe's and watch the
Aberdeen-Inverness Caley Thistle League cup final.
They're...
Those are football teams.
I'm not sure they are, Turbo.
Unfortunately, we have to be wheels-up in 10 minutes, so...
Okay.
All right.
Well, strictly business, then.
Aw, yeah.
New toys?
The exploding pen that you asked for.
I can't imagine a use for it.
You never wanted one?
[Chuckles]
And for you, Direct... uh, Agent Coulson with new bells and whistles.
And the directions will be there when you boot it up.
What's, uh...
What's the assignment?
[Sighs]
- It's classified.
- Right.
Everything is these days.
- Fitz, sadly, um...
- Yeah, you can't make the match, either.
- I have to finish my reports.
- Yeah, no, I get it.
That's okay.
Just a shame we hardly get to see each other.
- Any of us.
- [Sighs] Yes, well...
At least it's better than the friends we'll never see again.
[Sighs]
[Laptop beeps] [Music]
_
_ [Door closes]
[Breathing shakily]
We just stole a box.
I don't even know what was inside of it.
We...
We loaded it onto an 18-wheeler, we parked it in a warehouse, and we just left it.
Man:
Left it for who?
[Groans] The Chinatown Crew.
They set the job up and were willing to pay big.
[Grunts, groans]
Lies.
Aryan Brotherhood working with the Chinese?
I swear!
I swear that's all I know.
Where's this warehouse?
I...
I can't tell you that, man.
My people are gonna be mowed down in the payback... the ones you didn't already kill.
If you don't tell me, you'll have to tell him.
Coulson:
This guy's missing.
The rest are dead.
Aryan Brotherhood.
They're not my kind of brothers.
They've been know to work for cash.
Burglary, assault... sort of the value meal of hired guns.
They're suspected in the recent theft of this big rig.
- Probably prepping for a larger score.
- Big, yellow, hard to hide.
So, what, are we looking for this thing?
And if Daisy's chasing the same angle, maybe we get to the finish line first.
I'll greet her when she arrives.
- Davis:
Agent Coulson?
- Davis.
Preparing for decent.
Inhuman asset will be waiting on the tarmac.
[Tablet beeping]
What?
[Music]
- How's your wife, Davis?
- Getting bigger every day.
- Oh.
Don't tell her that.
- More beautiful every day.
[Chuckles]
There you go.
Mack.
Mack:
Yo-Yo.
[Sighs]
- Just have a few questions.
- I'm all yours.
Uh, so, I see you went to Colombia for a week.
Mm-hmm.
Mm.
And, uh, tickets to Miami coming up.
Yes.
Do you watch me sleep or shower or...?
Just procedure.
You don't have to use a satellite to get to know me better.
Just ask me to dinner again.
You know the rules about fraternizing with assets in the field. [Chuckles]
Oh, we haven't fraternized anything yet.
And I thought you were breaking the rules, coming to do my checkup early just to see me.
Or are you here because, uh, there's been a lot of little earthquakes lately?
Daisy could be in the area.
But officially, that's not the mission.
Doesn't matter.
We'll never find her.
She's always one step ahead.
What is the official mission?
Can I help?
Here's where I have to remind you that Sokovia Accords,
- which you signed...
- Oh, all right.
...require approval by the United Nations subcommittee...
- before an enhanced indiv...
- Rules, rules, rules.
Blah, blah, blah.
S.H.I.E.L.D. moves too slow now, Turtleman.
- I prefer to move fast.
- Uh...
Mack, they found the truck.
Good to see you, too, Coulson!
Well, if you're in Miami, look me up.
Just because we can't work together doesn't mean we can't live a little.
[Sighs]
[Crowd cheering on television]
[Doorbell rings]
Hey, just in time.
They've just taken to the pitch.
Where's Jemma?
Is she not coming?
Yeah, she wanted to.
Same story.
All work and no play, huh?
That's a bit disappointing.
Still, make yourself comfortable.
I'm just, uh, finishing cleaning up.
[Music]
Yeah, should be pretty lopsided, don't you think?
Their keeper's absolutely crap...
Oh, my gosh!
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I had no idea there was somebody here.
Hello.
[Sighs] You...
You weren't meant to see that.
Hello.
I'm glad to final...
- Hello.
I'm glad to final...
- Fitz, meet Aida.
- Hello.
I'm glad to final...
- She's, uh, crashed.
Hello.
I'm glad to final...
Hello.
I'm glad to final...
Hello.
I'm glad to final...
Hello.
I'm glad to final...
Hello.
I'm glad to final...
Hello.
I'm glad to final...
[Powers down]
[Remote beeping]
- What the hell?
- Well, I've just upped her PSU to compensate for image processing.
Must have overcranked it.
I'll reboot.
Unh-unh, that's not what I meant.
I meant...
- ...what the hell?
!
- Well, you've already met Aida, digital personal assistant, as a voice on the computer.
So, uh...
- I built her a body.
- Yeah, a naked body.
I-I was just now installing new hardware, updating her gyroscopic sensors.
I'm not some sicko.
When did you build this?
Have you forgotten the very strict stipulations that came with your pardon?
You are not allowed experimentation
- without approval and oversight!
- Oversight, I know.
I'm well aware of that, yeah.
That's why I wanted Simmons here.
I wanted to show both of you.
Look.
This has been a lifelong dream of mine, Fitz.
When I saw the work you and Simmons were doing in replicating human tissue and internal bone structure in Coulson's hand, I knew...
I knew right then that this was within reach.
- A robot?
- Not just a robot.
It's one that can cross the uncanny valley and come out the other side...
pass for a human.
I mean, it has bloody micro-expressions.
She.
It's a...
It's definitely a "she" 'cause I saw...
- Yes...
- She has micro-expressions, full range of motion.
I mean, physically, it's...
- she's nearly perfect.
- She is very realistic.
[Music]
Now, mentally, well, you've spoken with Aida.
She's bright, she laughs at the jokes
I programmed her to recognize, but she's never pass the Turing test.
At the moment, that's a pipe dream.
However, I think, with your help...
No, no.
No, no, no, no!
We have to report this right away.
- You could lose everything.
- I know.
- Or you could go to jail.
- I know!
I know, you're right.
Full disclosure at this time is the best course of action.
I...
I agree.
Hmm.
At least let me show you how it works.
[Air brakes hiss]
They're in town.
I supposed you guessed that, texting me.
They're looking for a truck.
That mean you have something for me?
They watch my every move, but certain moves they can't see.
You can't get these over the counter.
S.H.I.E.L.D. issue for rapid bone healing, yes?
I know you splintered your bones when you first powered up.
- Are you pushing yourself too hard?
- Don't worry about me.
You can't use your powers too much.
- Your body will break down.
- I'm fine.
I'm surprised you're still in town.
You're usually moving and moving.
Are you, uh, still hunting those perros rabiosos?
It's not just the Watchdogs now.
Local gangs have been working for them, which I... don't understand.
I was tracing the sale of a weapon, and I...
I think I may have stumbled upon a serial killer.
Ooh.
Fun.
He live around here?
He mostly hits this area, but he's hard to track down, leaves no traces behind, operates alone.
Sound familiar?
I thought maybe you were, uh, growing roots, they say.
- L.A. used to be where you hang out, no?
- No roots.
Everyone gets attached to something eventually.
Don't forget to wait two stops after I get off.
Yeah, yeah.
Hey.
Send me a picture of this guy.
Maybe I can cover some ground if I know what he looks like.
No, I still haven't gotten a good look at him yet, so just... take care of yourself, okay?
But thank you for the S.H.I.E.L.D. intel.
They won't give up on you, especially Coulson.
All he wants is to find you.
Well, that's too bad, 'cause there's only one thing I want.
Oh, yeah?
What's that?
Nothing to lose.
Here's the Mapping-Action Eyewear you requested.
Should help your team in case of a blind takedown.
- Great.
Thanks.
- I need you to sign for it.
I don't get the new color-coded security-level rainbow of...
- What's it called?
- The "Spectrum of Security."
Why do I, level red, have to go through you, level orange, to request hardware?
Shouldn't red be higher than orange?
Well, orange encompasses both red and yellow, so...
It's hard to explain, but the Director didn't want to use numbers because he didn't want any team member to feel less than.
Well, you do have a higher clearance than me.
Only in most instances.
I feel less than.
Hey, we just had a report come in.
A death in a hospital in Los Angeles.
Suspicious circumstances.
Suspect is an Asian female.
You think it might be Daisy.
I'm going to look into it.
I just wondered if you'd heard anything from your law-enforcement contacts?
I'm mostly in the dark these days.
Why don't you ask the Director?
Since you're one of the few people allowed or willing to do that.
[Spray-pain can rattles]
What you got there?
Didn't hear?
Word is, he hit again last night.
- Two dead in the street.
- Who?
Ghost Rider.
You must not be from around here.
Do you know where I can find him?
Nobody does.
Everybody that sees his face ends up on this wall.
"Everyone gets attached to something."
[Engine revs, tires screech]
Man:
We got to get this truck out of here.
What are you, the Feds?
Something like that.
We'll be sealing the scene.
Not for long, I hope.
I was just gonna have this guy tow this thing away so me and my crew can get back to work.
We got this.
Man:
This warehouse usually sits empty.
We were gonna store some inventory today.
Found the lock broken and this big, honkin' thing inside.
- Have at it.
- Coulson:
Thank you.
[Wrist beeps]
[Music]
Not fair.
You want tech like this, you should've cut off your own hand.
Mack.
Okay.
Mack:
Looks like these guys tore each other apart.
Zhang Wei, resident of Monterey Park.
Organ donor.
Say anything about him being a flesh-hungry rage monster?
Uh, no, I'm not seeing anything about that here, so we have to assume that he wasn't until he came in contact with whatever's in that trailer.
Not much here that'll lead us anywhere.
Well... there's that.
[Door slams]
[Keys rattling]
There was no buyer there.
[Car door closes]
[Engine starts, revs]
No, no, no.
No!
Please, God, no!
No!
I don't deserve to die!
- No!
No!
- Everyone says that.
No!
No!
No!
Diego:
Yeah, those chargers are hard to find.
Between "Fast and Furious" and "Dukes of Hazzard,"
they wrecked a lot of them.
My boyfriend wrecked his in a street race.
He's pretty broken up.
I guess he was more attached to it than I thought.
I ain't seen none around here, though.
- Sorry.
- All right.
Thanks, man.
Hey, uh, most of them wrecked movie cars, they're dumped at El Monte Junk and Salvage.
If your boyfriend wants to fix his ride up, might want to go over there and find scraps.
Thanks.
Maybe he'll go there.
Simmons:
Daisy's in Los Angeles.
There was an eyewitness, now dead, and I just received Yo-Yo's check-in report a week early, which means Coulson and Mack are there, too,
- no doubt, trying to track Daisy down.
- Sounds right.
You know it is, because according to the logs, you called Coulson back to H.Q. for resupply yourself.
Why, if not to give him that intel in person, knowing it's against the Director's orders?
I didn't send them.
I don't have the authority.
- They acted on their own.
- You knew I'd find out.
Why not tell me?
I have daily lie detection.
- That's why.
- And now I have to report it, which means now I either look like I'm incompetent
- or colluding with you.
- Wouldn't want you falling out of favor with the director.
[Sighs]
Okay.
I get it.
It's abundantly clear you're uncomfortable with my new position...
I just want to know how comfortable you are with it.
You actually trust this guy?
Our team split up to lead departments, given different colors.
'Cause we're experts?
No.
I think the Director broke up the band on purpose.
Of course he did!
[Sighs]
As soon as Talbot gave the location of this base to the president, things changed.
I knew we'd be divided, undermined, kept in the dark, so I have been clawing for as much power as I can possibly grab to keep a modicum of control over any of this.
After all we've been through...
[Sighs]
I don't trust the new Director, but he trusts me, so now, in order to keep that trust,
I must take the appropriate action to address this break in protocol.
I'm sending you and your strike team to take Coulson and Mack out of the field, by force, if necessary.
Clean up whatever mess he's in.
- That's an order.
- Yes, ma'am.
Mack:
Place them at the four corners of the exterior of the building.
That'll give us visuals through the walls.
Fitz:
This could be very dangerous.
- So much could go wrong.
- Ultron, yes.
I know.
But this is not A.I. A.I. is banned, and that's good.
This is mimicry of human behavior.
Still, in the wrong hands, this could be used as a weapon.
- Is that the idea?
- No, absolutely not.
No...
Look, I know the dangers.
That's why I've been...
I've been reticent to divulge.
I don't know these new people at S.H.I.E.L.D.
But a weapon is absolutely not the idea.
Well, then, why?
What's she for?
Why not let Aida tell you herself?
[Remote beeps] [Silent whir]
[Music]
Hello.
I'm glad to finally shake your hand, Leopold.
Where's Jemma?
We were hoping that she would come.
S-She's, uh... indisposed, I'm afraid.
Aida...
- I was wondering...
- Yes, Agent Fitz?
[Breathes deeply]
I was wondering if you could tell me exactly what it is you are designed for.
Of course.
Dr. Radcliffe, time and again, has expressed his deep regret for causing pain when all he ever wanted was to prevent it.
He speaks often of the pain that you and Agent Simmons have had to suffer, having lost so many friends...
Lincoln Campbell,
Andrew Garner, Antoine Triplett...
Okay, stop it, stop.
You don't have to list them.
Sorry.
The hope is that I will be able to prevent future tragedies... save the lives of agents by putting myself in harm's way in their place.
- To kill?
- No.
I am incapable of that.
I will protect.
I will serve as a decoy target, a safeguard...
- ...a shield.
- Okay.
T-Turn her off.
[Breathes deeply]
[Remote beeps] [Powers down]
[Sighs]
We can't tell Simmons about this.
What?
Don't we want to move forward?
Her approval is...
This is too dangerous to show the new Director.
We don't know what he'd do with it.
And she would have to tell him, so... she can't know.
- Not until...
- Until...?
Until she's perfect.
[Music]
[Music]
Coulson:
They're walking in now, six.
Really convivial-looking fellows.
At least four of them are packing.
Mack:
We should be tapped into surveillance now.
Let's see what we get.
[Tablet beeps]
Where are the other two men?
We had to leave them at the pick-up site.
Explain.
Those guys were transferring the box into the armored transport.
Maybe they peeked inside or something.
But they went berserk and tore into each other.
There was blood everywhere.
We put two bullets in each of them and locked them in the truck.
No, no.
Look, we were freaking out.
We had to get out of there!
Did you burn their bodies or dump the truck in the ocean?
Because if not, they can be traced back here.
They probably saw what was in this box and were fighting over it, you idiot!
I have been told it's powerful enough to bring our new enhanced enemies to their knees.
We get on comms and call the Zephyr for backup, headquarters will know we're on Daisy's trail.
No orders to pull out.
She's been tracking this sale.
- She could show up here any minute.
- I don't know.
Let's let this play out, see if anyone else makes an appearance.
[Music]
Daisy:
Excuse me.
Uh, the yard's closing.
To sell a junker, you can call the number on the gate.
Oh, no, I'm not here for that.
I, uh...
Uh, sorry.
What's your name?
Robbie.
Well, Robbie, I am looking for a guy with a sweet black '69 Charger.
Maybe he bought some parts here.
Sorry.
Doesn't ring a bell.
I only work nights once a week.
Uh, well, maybe I'll...
I'll come back in the morning.
Thank you.
Or... there's a book of sales you can flip through in the main office.
Not really an office.
More of a trailer, but I can show you.
That would be great, thank you.
[Men gasping]
[Tablet whirs] The hell...?
What was that?
A breath of fresh air.
[Ghostly shriek] [Gasps]
[Men grunting]
Get away from me!
That's it there.
- So, you live around here?
- No, I used to.
I'm just in town for a couple days, soaking up the sun.
Strange place to spend your vacation.
[Keys rattling]
Not a great neighborhood.
[Rumbling]
[Breathing heavily]
So... you've got the devil inside you, too.
What's going on, guys?
[Tablet whirs]
Call for backup, yeah?
We can't wait for Daisy.
These guys might kill somebody besides each other.
Yeah.
Us.
Z One, we got a situation.
We need a little help here.
[Gunshot]
That was efficient.
[Tablet beeps]
[Goggles beep, whir]
[Goggles beeping, whirring]
You guys know what to do.
[Music]
Damn.
May:
All clear.
[Fighting sounds] [Music]
[Rumbling]
You shouldn't have gotten involved.
Serial killers always complain when we try to intervene.
I only kill asesinos who deserve it.
It's vengeance, chica.
For what?
You killed a detective.
But he had blood on his hands.
- A teacher!
- A pedophile.
[Rumbling]
You don't get to decide who deserves to die.
I'm not the one who decides.
[Grunts]
[Music]
[Rumbling]
[Rumbling]
[Panting]
Do it. [Panting] I deserve it.
Do it.
[Grunts]
[Engine starts]
[Tires screech]
[Grunts]
[Music]
[Music stops]
[Brakes squeak]
Hey.
Thank for the ride, Janet.
You never accept rides.
Bus break down?
Or you still trying to holler at Janet's little sister?
Maybe.
I only needed a ride to help Canelo balance some books because my brother didn't finish high school.
Yo, I finished high school...
in the 11th grade.
[Chuckles]
"Everyone's attached to something."
[Engine starts]
[Indistinct conversations]
- Spent a lot of time in here?
- Too much.
My wallet's starting to get sick of it.
Your little side mission didn't go unnoticed.
Well, you showed up, so, yeah.
The Director will want to have words with you at H.Q.
[Chuckles]
[Sighs]
- No Daisy, huh?
- No.
But she was tracking these guys, so maybe this is a win.
I don't know.
The ground team is checking for contagion, but hopefully, whatever messed with these guys' heads is no longer an issue.
We're gonna analyze the box it came in.
It's good... to have a moment, just us.
It's been a long time since we had a moment alone.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
Just a long day.
Well, take advantage of the down time.
Who knows what tomorrow holds?
It's coming!
Get ready!
Go, man, go!
Damn it!
Damn it!
Engine's dead!
Get it.
Kill it!
Shoot anything that moves.
Help.
He ...
He got me.
He'll kill us all.
Give me that damn thing.
Get back!
Shoot it!
Shoot it now!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No, please!
No!

You need to sacrifice everything if you want to survive.
Hmm.
That's funny.
'Cause I thought I would just...
Mm.
Yeah, that's one way to go.
Want a beer?
It's 6:00 in the morning.
What, are you Hemingway?
No, is that real?
When did we cross the North Pole?
An hour ago.
Oh, my gosh.
It's hard to keep track in this thing.
We shouldn't have to stay on clock when we're moving through time zones.
I mean, what is that ...
three continents in two days?
If you count Berlin.
We were only there three hours.
Yeah, we knew that Inhuman call was a hoax as soon as we stepped foot in the apartment, saw that bong.
- I could smell it from the hallway.
- Jokers.
Hungry for attention.
And potato chips.
If the munchies was a superpower, they'd be signing the Sokovia Accords as we speak.
You should let me work on Lola.
I warned you.
Everything in Lola is custom.
Yeah, yeah, everything is custom.
But it would be something to do.
There's only so many times a guy can win cash off you... sir.
You got to stop calling me that.
- We're being called back to H.Q.
- They say why?
We're not due for a restock for another 10 days.
- No idea.
They said it's classified.
- Oh, everything is nowadays.
All right, we'll need full inventory.
Medical, provisions, fuel cells, and make sure you tell the crew they'll need to call ahead if they want off our next deployment.
Agent Thompson...
- Wonder what that's about.
- Oh, I don't know.
- It'll be good to see Fitz and Simmons.
- And May.
Yeah...
I think you look forward to that more than I do.
Hyah!
What was his mistake?
You know I'm not gonna talk.
He didn't anticipate your back kick.
Opened himself up.
His mistake was he tapped out.
- Piper.
- Okay, people!
What, you never seen the biggest plane ever built before?
!
Next pairing, on the mat!
- How long has it been?
- Six weeks in the air.
Only the Quinjet touched down.
- Is that a record for Zephyr One?
- It is.
It was supposed to be even longer.
- You know who called us in?
- I do.
You?
Okay.
Now I know something's up.
I got word from contacts in law enforcement, Los Angeles.
Two civilians were violently killed.
Mysterious burns, heads bashed in, spine pulled out of his ...
Wow.
Many conflicting accounts, but all agree... it was odd.
Odd?
Isn't that our wheelhouse?
He's right.
Why call us in?
We could be headed to the scene right now to confirm the presence of an enhanced person,
- if there is one.
- If it checks out, we bag and tag.
We handle these on the fly.
Didn't exactly want to send this out on the wire.
May, you're not sharing again.
Now would be a really good time to share.
The police also have another victim in custody.
Critical condition.
Under sedation, he mentioned seeing a girl, saying it was the one from the news.
Quake.
Which you didn't want to send over the wire.
You were pulled off Daisy's case.
The Director thinks she slipped through our fingers too many times.
The Director thinks you let her.
No, we pursued her.
She was a ghost.
Well, in his infinite wisdom, he says you're now forbidden to.
But you're telling us this because... ?
In case we want to do something about it.
Look, I can bury this until the official police report comes through.
That'll buy us a few hours lead time.
Get to L.A., sniff around.
Yeah.
We have an active Inhuman asset in Los Angeles that's due for a check-in soon enough.
It'll justify our presence there, but as soon as the report's filed, they'll pull us out.
And the armed forces will be sent in after her.
With orders to kill.
- To kill?
- If she's responsible for these bodies.
- That's not Daisy's M.O.
- The world knows her as Quake, and Quake is an outlaw who takes down banks and bridges.
- Oh, come on.
We both know
- She's hunting violent radicals.
she's tracking these fanatics, the Watchdogs, trying to take down their funding, their ... their escape routes.
Regardless, you should fuel up and get back up in the air ASAP.
Find her before the military does something bad.
Or Daisy does something worse.
Hey.
You can't be here.
Stop right there.
How are we feeling today?
I've been tracking weapon sales, and I know you were hired to steal one.
You even jacked a big rig to help carry it out.
We were just paid for a smash-and-grab job.
Who was that hunting you?
Open the door!
He nailed me, but we almost got away.
Who was it?
- Did he kill my friends?
- All but one.
But you're gonna have to give me a little bit more if I'm gonna find him alive.
Save him, please, before he gets burned, too.
You'll see your buddy again once you heal up.
- Just tell me what's ...
- No.
No.
It's too late for me.
They say when the Rider burns you he burns your soul.
And a soul can never heal.
Stop right there!
Hello?
Hello?
I hear my voice echo, but it sounds strange in my head.
The detail is amazing.
However, I am 3 feet off the ground.
Wait.
What?
Hold on.
Damn it.
Uh, well, I did adjust the Y axis earlier for some reason.
- What does that look like now?
- Better.
The CPU seems to be handling the high poly count.
Textures are impeccable.
We should build a place to get away ... a meadow or a cottage somewhere.
I wish it were ever this quiet.
Direct-current stimulation.
Creates the other senses like touch and taste but also takes feedback.
So I've just mapped your brain's response ...
Response to the environment.
Of course.
Dr. Radcliffe came up with the architecture?
Yeah.
Yeah, he calls it "The Framework."
But all the transcranial apparatus, that's all me.
No.
Of course, you're brilliant, too.
Of course.
'Cause soon you won't even need the eyewear or the earwear, 'cause it'll all be inside your head.
So May's strike team will be able to train virtually instead of May constantly breaking their ribs.
Hey, hey.
Authorized personnel only, pal.
No pass, no entry.
- Who the hell are you?
- Leave them be, Nathanson.
They have more reason to be here than you do.
Wow.
A lot of new faces.
Good to see yours.
Six weeks.
That's a record.
- Heard you got a promotion.
- Oh, yeah, and a title.
Yeah, Special Advisor to the Director in Science and Technology.
Or "SADIST."
- They keeping you busy?
- With busywork, mostly.
Yeah, and random state-of-the-art lie-detector tests.
So that's the cost of being in the Director's inner circle.
Yeah, he's paranoid about what happened the last time S.H.I.E.L.D. was government-run.
Calls it his Widespread Infiltration Monitoring Program.
Or "WIMP." Hey, uh, you should join us 'cause we're gonna go to Radcliffe's and watch the
Aberdeen-Inverness Caley Thistle League cup final.
They're ...
Those are football teams.
I'm not sure they are, Turbo.
Unfortunately, we have to be wheels-up in 10 minutes, so...
Okay.
All right.
Well, strictly business, then.
Aw, yeah.
New toys?
The exploding pen that you asked for.
I can't imagine a use for it.
You never wanted one?
And for you, Direct... uh, Agent Coulson...
.. with new bells and whistles.
And the directions will be there when you boot it up.
What's, uh ...
What's the assignment?
- It's classified.
- Right.
Everything is these days.
- Fitz, sadly, um...
- Yeah, you can't make the match, either.
- I have to finish my reports.
- Yeah, no, I get it.
That's okay.
Just a shame we hardly get to see each other.
- Any of us.
- Yes, well...
At least it's better than the friends we'll never see again.
Trusted Teacher Killed.
Home Burned.
FOR HOUSEKEEPING
We just stole a box.
I don't even know what was inside of it.
We ...
We loaded it onto an 18-wheeler, we parked it in a warehouse, and we just left it.
Left it for who?
The Chinatown Crew.
They set the job up and were willing to pay big.
Lies.
Aryan Brotherhood working with the Chinese?
I swear!
I swear that's all I know.
Where's this warehouse?
I ...
I can't tell you that, man.
My people are gonna be mowed down in the payback ... the ones you didn't already kill.
If you don't tell me, you'll have to tell him.
This guy's missing.
The rest are dead.
Aryan Brotherhood.
They're not my kind of brothers.
They've been know to work for cash.
Burglary, assault ... sort of the value meal of hired guns.
They're suspected in the recent theft of this big rig.
- Probably prepping for a larger score.
- Big, yellow, hard to hide.
So, what, are we looking for this thing?
And if Daisy's chasing the same angle, maybe we get to the finish line first.
I'll greet her when she arrives.
- Agent Coulson?
- Davis.
Preparing for decent.
Inhuman asset will be waiting on the tarmac.
What?
- How's your wife, Davis?
- Getting bigger every day.
- Oh.
Don't tell her that.
- More beautiful every day.
There you go.
Mack.
Yo-Yo.
- Just have a few questions.
- I'm all yours.
Uh, so, I see you went to Colombia for a week.
Mm-hmm.
Mm.
And, uh, tickets to Miami coming up.
Yes.
Do you watch me sleep or shower or... ?
Just procedure.
You don't have to use a satellite to get to know me better.
Just ask me to dinner again.
You know the rules about fraternizing with assets in the field.
Oh, we haven't fraternized anything yet.
And I thought you were breaking the rules, coming to do my checkup early just to see me.
Or are you here because, uh, there's been a lot of little earthquakes lately?
Daisy could be in the area.
But officially, that's not the mission.
Doesn't matter.
We'll never find her.
She's always one step ahead.
What is the official mission?
Can I help?
Here's where I have to remind you that Sokovia Accords,
- which you signed...
- Oh, all right.
require approval by the United Nations subcommittee...
- before an enhanced indiv...
- Rules, rules, rules.
Blah, blah, blah.
S.H.I.E.L.D. moves too slow now, Turtleman.
- I prefer to move fast.
- Uh...
Mack, they found the truck.
Good to see you, too, Coulson!
Well, if you're in Miami, look me up.
Just because we can't work together doesn't mean we can't live a little.
Hey, just in time.
They've just taken to the pitch.
Where's Jemma?
Is she not coming?
Yeah, she wanted to.
Same story.
All work and no play, huh?
That's a bit disappointing.
Still, make yourself comfortable.
I'm just, uh, finishing cleaning up.
Yeah, should be pretty lopsided, don't you think?
Their keeper's absolutely crap...
Oh, my gosh!
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I had no idea there was somebody here.
Hello.
You ...
You weren't meant to see that.
Hello.
I'm glad to final...
- Hello.
I'm glad to final...
- Fitz, meet Aida.
- Hello.
I'm glad to final...
- She's, uh, crashed.
Hello.
I'm glad to final...
Hello.
I'm glad to final...
Hello.
I'm glad to final...
Hello.
I'm glad to final...
Hello.
I'm glad to final...
Hello.
I'm glad to final...
- What the hell?
- Well, I've just upped her PSU to compensate for image processing.
Must have overcranked it.
I'll reboot.
Unh-unh, that's not what I meant.
I meant...
- ...what the hell?
!
- Well, you've already met Aida, digital personal assistant, as a voice on the computer.
So, uh...
- I built her a body.
- Yeah, a naked body.
I-I was just now installing new hardware, updating her gyroscopic sensors.
I'm not some sicko.
When did you build this?
Have you forgotten the very strict stipulations that came with your pardon?
You are not allowed experimentation
- without approval and oversight!
- Oversight, I know.
I'm well aware of that, yeah.
That's why I wanted Simmons here.
I wanted to show both of you.
Look.
This has been a lifelong dream of mine, Fitz.
When I saw the work you and Simmons were doing in replicating human tissue and internal bone structure in Coulson's hand, I knew ...
I knew right then that this was within reach.
- A robot?
- Not just a robot.
It's one that can cross the uncanny valley and come out the other side ...
pass for a human.
I mean, it has bloody micro-expressions.
She.
It's a ...
It's definitely a "she" 'cause I saw ...
- Yes...
- She has micro-expressions, full range of motion.
I mean, physically, it's ...
- she's nearly perfect.
- She is very realistic.
Now, mentally, well, you've spoken with Aida.
She's bright, she laughs at the jokes
I programmed her to recognize, but she's never pass the Turing test.
At the moment, that's a pipe dream.
However, I think, with your help...
No, no.
No, no, no, no!
We have to report this right away.
- You could lose everything.
- I know.
- Or you could go to jail.
- I know!
I know, you're right.
Full disclosure at this time is the best course of action.
I ...
I agree.
Hmm.
At least let me show you how it works.
They're in town.
I supposed you guessed that, texting me.
They're looking for a truck.
That mean you have something for me?
They watch my every move, but certain moves they can't see.
You can't get these over the counter.
S.H.I.E.L.D. issue for rapid bone healing, yes?
I know you splintered your bones when you first powered up.
- Are you pushing yourself too hard?
- Don't worry about me.
You can't use your powers too much.
- Your body will break down.
- I'm fine.
I'm surprised you're still in town.
You're usually moving and moving.
Are you, uh, still hunting those perros rabiosos?
It's not just the Watchdogs now.
Local gangs have been working for them, which I... don't understand.
I was tracing the sale of a weapon, and I...
I think I may have stumbled upon a serial killer.
Ooh.
Fun.
He live around here?
He mostly hits this area, but he's hard to track down, leaves no traces behind, operates alone.
Sound familiar?
I thought maybe you were, uh, growing roots, they say.
- L.A. used to be where you hang out, no?
- No roots.
Everyone gets attached to something eventually.
Don't forget to wait two stops after I get off.
Yeah, yeah.
Hey.
Send me a picture of this guy.
Maybe I can cover some ground if I know what he looks like.
No, I still haven't gotten a good look at him yet, so just...
take care of yourself, okay?
But thank you for the S.H.I.E.L.D. Intel.
They won't give up on you, especially Coulson.
All he wants is to find you.
Well, that's too bad, 'cause there's only one thing I want.
Oh, yeah?
What's that?
Nothing to lose.
Here's the Mapping-Action Eyewear you requested.
Should help your team in case of a blind takedown.
- Great.
Thanks.
- I need you to sign for it.
I don't get the new color-coded security-level rainbow of...
- What's it called?
- The "Spectrum of Security."
Why do I, level red, have to go through you, level orange, to request hardware?
Shouldn't red be higher than orange?
Well, orange encompasses both red and yellow, so...
It's hard to explain, but the Director didn't want to use numbers because he didn't want any team member to feel less than.
Well, you do have a higher clearance than me.
Only in most instances.
I feel less than.
Hey, we just had a report come in.
A death in a hospital in Los Angeles.
Suspicious circumstances.
Suspect is an Asian female.
You think it might be Daisy.
I'm going to look into it.
I just wondered if you'd heard anything from your law-enforcement contacts?
I'm mostly in the dark these days.
Why don't you ask the Director?
Since you're one of the few people allowed or willing to do that.
What you got there?
Didn't hear?
Word is, he hit again last night.
- Two dead in the street.
- Who?
Ghost Rider.
You must not be from around here.
Do you know where I can find him?
Nobody does.
Everybody that sees his face ends up on this wall.
"Everyone gets attached to something."
We got to get this truck out of here.
What are you, the Feds?
Something like that.
We'll be sealing the scene.
Not for long, I hope.
I was just gonna have this guy tow this thing away so me and my crew can get back to work.
We got this.
This warehouse usually sits empty.
We were gonna store some inventory today.
Found the lock broken and this big, honkin' thing inside.
- Have at it.
- Thank you.
Not fair.
You want tech like this, you should've cut off your own hand.
Mack.
Okay.
Looks like these guys tore each other apart.
Zhang Wei, resident of Monterey Park.
Organ donor.
Say anything about him being a flesh-hungry rage monster?
Uh, no, I'm not seeing anything about that here, so we have to assume that he wasn't until he came in contact with whatever's in that trailer.
Not much here that'll lead us anywhere.
Well... there's that.
There was no buyer there.
No, no, no.
No!
Please, God, no!
No!
I don't deserve to die!
- No!
No!
- Everyone says that.
No!
No!
No!
Yeah, those chargers are hard to find.
Between "Fast and Furious" and "Dukes of Hazzard,"
they wrecked a lot of them.
My boyfriend wrecked his in a street race.
He's pretty broken up.
I guess he was more attached to it than I thought.
I ain't seen none around here, though.
- Sorry.
- All right.
Thanks, man.
Hey, uh, most of them wrecked movie cars, they're dumped at El Monte Junk and Salvage.
If your boyfriend wants to fix his ride up, might want to go over there and find scraps.
Thanks.
Maybe he'll go there.
Daisy's in Los Angeles.
There was an eyewitness, now dead, and I just received Yo-Yo's check-in report a week early, which means Coulson and Mack are there, too,
- no doubt, trying to track Daisy down.
- Sounds right.
You know it is, because according to the logs, you called Coulson back to H.Q. for resupply yourself.
Why, if not to give him that intel in person, knowing it's against the Director's orders?
I didn't send them.
I don't have the authority.
- They acted on their own.
- You knew I'd find out.
Why not tell me?
I have daily lie detection.
- That's why.
- And now I have to report it, which means now I either look like I'm incompetent
- or colluding with you.
- Wouldn't want you falling out of favor with the director.
Okay.
I get it.
It's abundantly clear you're uncomfortable with my new position ...
I just want to know how comfortable you are with it.
You actually trust this guy?
Our team split up to lead departments, given different colors.
'Cause we're experts?
No.
I think the Director broke up the band on purpose.
Of course he did!
As soon as Talbot gave the location of this base to the president, things changed.
I knew we'd be divided, undermined, kept in the dark, so I have been clawing for as much power as I can possibly grab to keep a modicum of control over any of this.
After all we've been through...
I don't trust the new Director, but he trusts me, so now, in order to keep that trust,
I must take the appropriate action to address this break in protocol.
I'm sending you and your strike team to take Coulson and Mack out of the field, by force, if necessary.
Clean up whatever mess he's in.
- That's an order.
- Yes, ma'am.
Place them at the four corners of the exterior of the building.
That'll give us visuals through the walls.
This could be very dangerous.
- So much could go wrong.
- Ultron, yes.
I know.
But this is not A.I. A.I. is banned, and that's good.
This is mimicry of human behavior.
Still, in the wrong hands, this could be used as a weapon.
- Is that the idea?
- No, absolutely not.
No ...
Look, I know the dangers.
That's why I've been ...
I've been reticent to divulge.
I don't know these new people at S.H.I.E.L.D.
But a weapon is absolutely not the idea.
Well, then, why?
What's she for?
Why not let Aida tell you herself?
Hello.
I'm glad to finally shake your hand, Leopold.
Where's Jemma?
We were hoping that she would come.
S-She's, uh...
indisposed, I'm afraid.
Aida...
- I was wondering ...
- Yes, Agent Fitz?
I was wondering if you could tell me exactly what it is you are designed for.
Of course.
Dr. Radcliffe, time and again, has expressed his deep regret for causing pain when all he ever wanted was to prevent it.
He speaks often of the pain that you and Agent Simmons have had to suffer, having lost so many friends ...
Lincoln Campbell,
Andrew Garner, Antoine Triplett ...
Okay, stop it, stop.
You don't have to list them.
Sorry.
The hope is that I will be able to prevent future tragedies ... save the lives of agents by putting myself in harm's way in their place.
- To kill?
- No.
I am incapable of that.
I will protect.
I will serve as a decoy target, a safeguard... a shield.
- Okay.
T-Turn her off.
We can't tell Simmons about this.
What?
Don't we want to move forward?
Her approval is ...
This is too dangerous to show the new Director.
We don't know what he'd do with it.
And she would have to tell him, so... she can't know.
- Not until...
- Until... ?
Until she's perfect.
They're walking in now, six.
Really convivial-looking fellows.
At least four of them are packing.
We should be tapped into surveillance now.
Let's see what we get.
Where are the other two men?
We had to leave them at the pick-up site.
Explain.
Those guys were transferring the box into the armored transport.
Maybe they peeked inside or something.
But they went berserk and tore into each other.
There was blood everywhere.
We put two bullets in each of them and locked them in the truck.
No, no.
Look, we were freaking out.
We had to get out of there!
Did you burn their bodies or dump the truck in the ocean?
Because if not, they can be traced back here.
They probably saw what was in this box and were fighting over it, you idiot!
I have been told it's powerful enough to bring our new enhanced enemies to their knees.
We get on comms and call the Zephyr for backup, headquarters will know we're on Daisy's trail.
No orders to pull out.
She's been tracking this sale.
- She could show up here any minute.
- I don't know.
Let's let this play out, see if anyone else makes an appearance.
Excuse me.
Uh, the yard's closing.
To sell a junker, you can call the number on the gate.
Oh, no, I'm not here for that.
I, uh ...
Uh, sorry.
What's your name?
Robbie.
Well, Robbie, I am looking for a guy with a sweet black '69 Charger.
Maybe he bought some parts here.
Sorry.
Doesn't ring a bell.
I only work nights once a week.
Uh, well, maybe I'll ...
I'll come back in the morning.
Thank you.
Or...
there's a book of sales you can flip through in the main office.
Not really an office.
More of a trailer, but I can show you.
That would be great, thank you.
The hell... ?
What was that?
A breath of fresh air.
Get away from me!
That's it there.
- So, you live around here?
- No, I used to.
I'm just in town for a couple days, soaking up the sun.
Strange place to spend your vacation.
So... you've got the devil inside you, too.
What's going on, guys?
Call for backup, yeah?
We can't wait for Daisy.
These guys might kill somebody besides each other.
Yeah.
Us.
Z One, we got a situation.
We need a little help here.
That was efficient.
You guys know what to do.
Damn.
All clear.
You shouldn't have gotten involved.
Serial killers always complain when we try to intervene.
I only kill asesinos who deserve it.
It's vengeance, chica.
For what?
You killed a detective.
But he had blood on his hands.
- A teacher!
- A pedophile.
You don't get to decide who deserves to die.
I'm not the one who decides.
Do it.
I deserve it.
Do it.
Hey.
Thank for the ride, Janet.
You never accept rides.
Bus break down?
Or you still trying to holler at Janet's little sister?
Maybe.
I only needed a ride to help Canelo balance some books because my brother didn't finish high school.
Yo, I finished high school...
in the 11th grade.
"Everyone's attached to something."
- Spent a lot of time in here?
- Too much.
My wallet's starting to get sick of it.
Your little side mission didn't go unnoticed.
Well, you showed up, so, yeah.
The Director will want to have words with you at H.Q.
- No Daisy, huh?
- No.
But she was tracking these guys, so maybe this is a win.
I don't know.
The ground team is checking for contagion, but hopefully, whatever messed with these guys' heads is no longer an issue.
We're gonna analyze the box it came in.
It's good...
to have a moment, just us.
It's been a long time since we had a moment alone.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
Just a long day.
Well, take advantage of the down time.
Who knows what tomorrow holds?
Precisely Synchronized by srjanapala
It's coming!
Get ready!
Go, man, go!
Aah!
Damn it!
Damn it!
Engine's dead!
Get it.
Kill it!
Shoot anything that moves.
Help.
He...
He got me.
He'll kill us all.
Give me that damn thing.
Get back!
Shoot it!
Shoot it now!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No, please!
No!
4x01 - "The Ghost"
You need to sacrifice everything if you want to survive.
Hmm.
That's funny.
'Cause I thought I would just...
Mm.
Yeah, that's one way to go.
Want a beer?
It's 6:00 in the morning.
What, are you Hemingway?
No, is that real?
When did we cross the North Pole?
An hour ago.
Oh, my gosh.
It's hard to keep track in this thing.
We shouldn't have to stay on clock when we're moving through time zones.
I mean, what is that...
three continents in two days?
If you count Berlin.
We were only there three hours.
Yeah, we knew that Inhuman call was a hoax as soon as we stepped foot in the apartment, saw that bong.
- I could smell it from the hallway.
- Jokers.
Hungry for attention.
And potato chips.
If the munchies was a superpower, they'd be signing the Sokovia Accords as we speak.
You should let me work on Lola.
I warned you.
Everything in Lola is custom.
Yeah, yeah, everything is custom.
But it would be something to do.
There's only so many times a guy can win cash off you... sir.
You got to stop calling me that.
- We're being called back to H.Q.
- They say why?
We're not due for a restock for another 10 days.
- No idea.
They said it's classified.
- Oh, everything is nowadays.
All right, we'll need full inventory.
Medical, provisions, fuel cells, and make sure you tell the crew they'll need to call ahead if they want off our next deployment.
Agent Thompson...
- Wonder what that's about.
- Oh, I don't know.
- It'll be good to see Fitz and Simmons.
- And May.
Yeah...
I think you look forward to that more than I do.
Hyah!
What was his mistake?
You know I'm not gonna talk.
He didn't anticipate your back kick.
Opened himself up.
His mistake was he tapped out.
- Piper.
- Okay, people!
What, you never seen the biggest plane ever built before?
!
Next pairing, on the mat!
- How long has it been?
- Six weeks in the air.
Only the Quinjet touched down.
- Is that a record for Zephyr One?
- It is.
It was supposed to be even longer.
- You know who called us in?
- I do.
You?
Okay.
Now I know something's up.
I got word from contacts in law enforcement, Los Angeles.
Two civilians were violently killed.
Mysterious burns, heads bashed in, spine pulled out of his...
Wow.
Many conflicting accounts, but all agree... it was odd.
Odd?
Isn't that our wheelhouse?
He's right.
Why call us in?
We could be headed to the scene right now to confirm the presence of an enhanced person,
- if there is one.
- If it checks out, we bag and tag.
We handle these on the fly.
Didn't exactly want to send this out on the wire.
May, you're not sharing again.
Now would be a really good time to share.
The police also have another victim in custody.
Critical condition.
Under sedation, he mentioned seeing a girl, saying it was the one from the news.
Quake.
Which you didn't want to send over the wire.
You were pulled off Daisy's case.
The Director thinks she slipped through our fingers too many times.
The Director thinks you let her.
No, we pursued her.
She was a ghost.
Well, in his infinite wisdom, he says you're now forbidden to.
But you're telling us this because...?
In case we want to do something about it.
Look, I can bury this until the official police report comes through.
That'll buy us a few hours lead time.
Get to L.A., sniff around.
Yeah.
We have an active Inhuman asset in Los Angeles that's due for a check-in soon enough.
It'll justify our presence there, but as soon as the report's filed, they'll pull us out.
And the armed forces will be sent in after her.
With orders to kill.
- To kill?
- If she's responsible for these bodies.
- That's not Daisy's M.O.
- The world knows her as Quake, and Quake is an outlaw who takes down banks and bridges.
- Oh, come on.
We both know
- She's hunting violent radicals.
She's tracking these fanatics, the Watchdogs, trying to take down their funding, their... their escape routes.
Regardless, you should fuel up and get back up in the air ASAP.
Find her before the military does something bad.
Or Daisy does something worse.
Hey.
You can't be here.
Stop right there.
How are we feeling today?
I've been tracking weapon sales, and I know you were hired to steal one.
You even jacked a big rig to help carry it out.
We were just paid for a smash-and-grab job.
Who was that hunting you?
Man:
Open the door!
He nailed me, but we almost got away.
Who was it?
- Did he kill my friends?
- All but one.
But you're gonna have to give me a little bit more if I'm gonna find him alive.
Save him, please, before he gets burned, too.
You'll see your buddy again once you heal up.
- Just tell me what's...
- No.
No.
It's too late for me.
They say when the Rider burns you he burns your soul.
And a soul can never heal.
Stop right there!
Hello?
Hello?
I hear my voice echo, but it sounds strange in my head.
The detail is amazing.
However, I am 3 feet off the ground.
Wait.
What?
Hold on.
Damn it.
Uh, well, I did adjust the Y axis earlier for some reason.
- What does that look like now?
- Better.
The CPU seems to be handling the high poly count.
Textures are impeccable.
We should build a place to get away... a meadow or a cottage somewhere.
I wish it were ever this quiet.
Direct-current stimulation.
Creates the other senses like touch and taste but also takes feedback.
So I've just mapped your brain's response...
Response to the environment.
Of course.
Dr. Radcliffe came up with the architecture?
Yeah.
Yeah, he calls it "The Framework."
But all the transcranial apparatus, that's all me.
No.
Of course, you're brilliant, too.
Of course.
'Cause soon you won't even need the eyewear or the earwear, 'cause it'll all be inside your head.
So May's strike team will be able to train virtually instead of May constantly breaking their ribs.
Hey, hey.
Authorized personnel only, pal.
No pass, no entry.
- Who the hell are you?
- Leave them be, Nathanson.
They have more reason to be here than you do.
Wow.
A lot of new faces.
Good to see yours.
Six weeks.
That's a record.
- Heard you got a promotion.
- Oh, yeah, and a title.
Yeah, Special Advisor to the Director in Science and Technology.
Or "SADIST."
- They keeping you busy?
- With busywork, mostly.
Yeah, and random state-of-the-art lie-detector tests.
So that's the cost of being in the Director's inner circle.
Yeah, he's paranoid about what happened the last time S.H.I.E.L.D. was government-run.
Calls it his Widespread Infiltration Monitoring Program.
Or "WIMP." Hey, uh, you should join us 'cause we're gonna go to Radcliffe's and watch the
Aberdeen-Inverness Caley Thistle League cup final.
They're...
Those are football teams.
I'm not sure they are, Turbo.
Unfortunately, we have to be wheels-up in 10 minutes, so...
Okay.
All right.
Well, strictly business, then.
Aw, yeah.
New toys?
The exploding pen that you asked for.
I can't imagine a use for it.
You never wanted one?
And for you, Direct... uh, Agent Coulson with new bells and whistles.
And the directions will be there when you boot it up.
What's, uh...
What's the assignment?
- It's classified.
- Right.
Everything is these days.
- Fitz, sadly, um...
- Yeah, you can't make the match, either.
- I have to finish my reports.
- Yeah, no, I get it.
That's okay.
Just a shame we hardly get to see each other.
- Any of us.
- Yes, well...
At least it's better than the friends we'll never see again.
_
_
We just stole a box.
I don't even know what was inside of it.
We...
We loaded it onto an 18-wheeler, we parked it in a warehouse, and we just left it.
Left it for who?
The Chinatown Crew.
They set the job up and were willing to pay big.
Lies.
Aryan Brotherhood working with the Chinese?
I swear!
I swear that's all I know.
Where's this warehouse?
I...
I can't tell you that, man.
My people are gonna be mowed down in the payback... the ones you didn't already kill.
If you don't tell me, you'll have to tell him.
This guy's missing.
The rest are dead.
Aryan Brotherhood.
They're not my kind of brothers.
They've been know to work for cash.
Burglary, assault... sort of the value meal of hired guns.
They're suspected in the recent theft of this big rig.
- Probably prepping for a larger score.
- Big, yellow, hard to hide.
So, what, are we looking for this thing?
And if Daisy's chasing the same angle, maybe we get to the finish line first.
I'll greet her when she arrives.
- Agent Coulson?
- Davis.
Preparing for decent.
Inhuman asset will be waiting on the tarmac.
What?
- How's your wife, Davis?
- Getting bigger every day.
- Oh.
Don't tell her that.
- More beautiful every day.
There you go.
Mack.
Yo-Yo.
- Just have a few questions.
- I'm all yours.
Uh, so, I see you went to Colombia for a week.
Mm-hmm.
Mm.
And, uh, tickets to Miami coming up.
Yes.
Do you watch me sleep or shower or...?
Just procedure.
You don't have to use a satellite to get to know me better.
Just ask me to dinner again.
You know the rules about fraternizing with assets in the field.
Oh, we haven't fraternized anything yet.
And I thought you were breaking the rules, coming to do my checkup early just to see me.
Or are you here because, uh, there's been a lot of little earthquakes lately?
Daisy could be in the area.
But officially, that's not the mission.
Doesn't matter.
We'll never find her.
She's always one step ahead.
What is the official mission?
Can I help?
Here's where I have to remind you that Sokovia Accords,
- which you signed...
- Oh, all right.
...require approval by the United Nations subcommittee...
- before an enhanced indiv...
- Rules, rules, rules.
Blah, blah, blah.
S.H.I.E.L.D. moves too slow now, Turtleman.
- I prefer to move fast.
- Uh...
Mack, they found the truck.
Good to see you, too, Coulson!
Well, if you're in Miami, look me up.
Just because we can't work together doesn't mean we can't live a little.
Hey, just in time.
They've just taken to the pitch.
Where's Jemma?
Is she not coming?
Yeah, she wanted to.
Same story.
All work and no play, huh?
That's a bit disappointing.
Still, make yourself comfortable.
I'm just, uh, finishing cleaning up.
Yeah, should be pretty lopsided, don't you think?
Their keeper's absolutely crap...
Oh, my gosh!
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I had no idea there was somebody here.
Hello.
You...
You weren't meant to see that.
Hello.
I'm glad to final...
- Hello.
I'm glad to final...
- Fitz, meet Aida.
- Hello.
I'm glad to final...
- She's, uh, crashed.
Hello.
I'm glad to final...
Hello.
I'm glad to final...
Hello.
I'm glad to final...
Hello.
I'm glad to final...
Hello.
I'm glad to final...
Hello.
I'm glad to final...
- What the hell?
- Well, I've just upped her PSU to compensate for image processing.
Must have overcranked it.
I'll reboot.
Unh-unh, that's not what I meant.
I meant...
- ...what the hell?
!
- Well, you've already met Aida, digital personal assistant, as a voice on the computer.
So, uh...
- I built her a body.
- Yeah, a naked body.
I-I was just now installing new hardware, updating her gyroscopic sensors.
I'm not some sicko.
When did you build this?
Have you forgotten the very strict stipulations that came with your pardon?
You are not allowed experimentation
- without approval and oversight!
- Oversight, I know.
I'm well aware of that, yeah.
That's why I wanted Simmons here.
I wanted to show both of you.
Look.
This has been a lifelong dream of mine, Fitz.
When I saw the work you and Simmons were doing in replicating human tissue and internal bone structure in Coulson's hand, I knew...
I knew right then that this was within reach.
- A robot?
- Not just a robot.
It's one that can cross the uncanny valley and come out the other side...
pass for a human.
I mean, it has bloody micro-expressions.
She.
It's a...
It's definitely a "she" 'cause I saw...
- Yes...
- She has micro-expressions, full range of motion.
I mean, physically, it's...
- she's nearly perfect.
- She is very realistic.
Now, mentally, well, you've spoken with Aida.
She's bright, she laughs at the jokes
I programmed her to recognize, but she's never pass the Turing test.
At the moment, that's a pipe dream.
However, I think, with your help...
No, no.
No, no, no, no!
We have to report this right away.
- You could lose everything.
- I know.
- Or you could go to jail.
- I know!
I know, you're right.
Full disclosure at this time is the best course of action.
I...
I agree.
Hmm.
At least let me show you how it works.
They're in town.
I supposed you guessed that, texting me.
They're looking for a truck.
That mean you have something for me?
They watch my every move, but certain moves they can't see.
You can't get these over the counter.
S.H.I.E.L.D. issue for rapid bone healing, yes?
I know you splintered your bones when you first powered up.
- Are you pushing yourself too hard?
- Don't worry about me.
You can't use your powers too much.
- Your body will break down.
- I'm fine.
I'm surprised you're still in town.
You're usually moving and moving.
Are you, uh, still hunting those perros rabiosos?
It's not just the Watchdogs now.
Local gangs have been working for them, which I... don't understand.
I was tracing the sale of a weapon, and I...
I think I may have stumbled upon a serial killer.
Ooh.
Fun.
He live around here?
He mostly hits this area, but he's hard to track down, leaves no traces behind, operates alone.
Sound familiar?
I thought maybe you were, uh, growing roots, they say.
- L.A. used to be where you hang out, no?
- No roots.
Everyone gets attached to something eventually.
Don't forget to wait two stops after I get off.
Yeah, yeah.
Hey.
Send me a picture of this guy.
Maybe I can cover some ground if I know what he looks like.
No, I still haven't gotten a good look at him yet, so just... take care of yourself, okay?
But thank you for the S.H.I.E.L.D. intel.
They won't give up on you, especially Coulson.
All he wants is to find you.
Well, that's too bad, 'cause there's only one thing I want.
Oh, yeah?
What's that?
Nothing to lose.
Here's the Mapping-Action Eyewear you requested.
Should help your team in case of a blind takedown.
- Great.
Thanks.
- I need you to sign for it.
I don't get the new color-coded security-level rainbow of...
- What's it called?
- The "Spectrum of Security."
Why do I, level red, have to go through you, level orange, to request hardware?
Shouldn't red be higher than orange?
Well, orange encompasses both red and yellow, so...
It's hard to explain, but the Director didn't want to use numbers because he didn't want any team member to feel less than.
Well, you do have a higher clearance than me.
Only in most instances.
I feel less than.
Hey, we just had a report come in.
A death in a hospital in Los Angeles.
Suspicious circumstances.
Suspect is an Asian female.
You think it might be Daisy.
I'm going to look into it.
I just wondered if you'd heard anything from your law-enforcement contacts?
I'm mostly in the dark these days.
Why don't you ask the Director?
Since you're one of the few people allowed or willing to do that.
What you got there?
Didn't hear?
Word is, he hit again last night.
- Two dead in the street.
- Who?
Ghost Rider.
You must not be from around here.
Do you know where I can find him?
Nobody does.
Everybody that sees his face ends up on this wall.
"Everyone gets attached to something."
We got to get this truck out of here.
What are you, the Feds?
Something like that.
We'll be sealing the scene.
Not for long, I hope.
I was just gonna have this guy tow this thing away so me and my crew can get back to work.
We got this.
This warehouse usually sits empty.
We were gonna store some inventory today.
Found the lock broken and this big, honkin' thing inside.
- Have at it.
- Thank you.
Not fair.
You want tech like this, you should've cut off your own hand.
Mack.
Okay.
Looks like these guys tore each other apart.
Zhang Wei, resident of Monterey Park.
Organ donor.
Say anything about him being a flesh-hungry rage monster?
Uh, no, I'm not seeing anything about that here, so we have to assume that he wasn't until he came in contact with whatever's in that trailer.
Not much here that'll lead us anywhere.
Well... there's that.
There was no buyer there.
No, no, no.
No!
Please, God, no!
No!
I don't deserve to die!
- No!
No!
- Everyone says that.
No!
No!
No!
Yeah, those chargers are hard to find.
Between "Fast and Furious" and "Dukes of Hazzard,"
they wrecked a lot of them.
My boyfriend wrecked his in a street race.
He's pretty broken up.
I guess he was more attached to it than I thought.
I ain't seen none around here, though.
- Sorry.
- All right.
Thanks, man.
Hey, uh, most of them wrecked movie cars, they're dumped at El Monte Junk and Salvage.
If your boyfriend wants to fix his ride up, might want to go over there and find scraps.
Thanks.
Maybe he'll go there.
Daisy's in Los Angeles.
There was an eyewitness, now dead, and I just received Yo-Yo's check-in report a week early, which means Coulson and Mack are there, too,
- no doubt, trying to track Daisy down.
- Sounds right.
You know it is, because according to the logs, you called Coulson back to H.Q. for resupply yourself.
Why, if not to give him that intel in person, knowing it's against the Director's orders?
I didn't send them.
I don't have the authority.
- They acted on their own.
- You knew I'd find out.
Why not tell me?
I have daily lie detection.
- That's why.
- And now I have to report it, which means now I either look like I'm incompetent
- or colluding with you.
- Wouldn't want you falling out of favor with the director.
Okay.
I get it.
It's abundantly clear you're uncomfortable with my new position...
I just want to know how comfortable you are with it.
You actually trust this guy?
Our team split up to lead departments, given different colors.
'Cause we're experts?
No.
I think the Director broke up the band on purpose.
Of course he did!
As soon as Talbot gave the location of this base to the president, things changed.
I knew we'd be divided, undermined, kept in the dark, so I have been clawing for as much power as I can possibly grab to keep a modicum of control over any of this.
After all we've been through...
I don't trust the new Director, but he trusts me, so now, in order to keep that trust,
I must take the appropriate action to address this break in protocol.
I'm sending you and your strike team to take Coulson and Mack out of the field, by force, if necessary.
Clean up whatever mess he's in.
- That's an order.
- Yes, ma'am.
Place them at the four corners of the exterior of the building.
That'll give us visuals through the walls.
This could be very dangerous.
- So much could go wrong.
- Ultron, yes.
I know.
But this is not A.I. A.I. is banned, and that's good.
This is mimicry of human behavior.
Still, in the wrong hands, this could be used as a weapon.
- Is that the idea?
- No, absolutely not.
No...
Look, I know the dangers.
That's why I've been...
I've been reticent to divulge.
I don't know these new people at S.H.I.E.L.D.
But a weapon is absolutely not the idea.
Well, then, why?
What's she for?
Why not let Aida tell you herself?
Hello.
I'm glad to finally shake your hand, Leopold.
Where's Jemma?
We were hoping that she would come.
S-She's, uh... indisposed, I'm afraid.
Aida...
- I was wondering...
- Yes, Agent Fitz?
I was wondering if you could tell me exactly what it is you are designed for.
Of course.
Dr. Radcliffe, time and again, has expressed his deep regret for causing pain when all he ever wanted was to prevent it.
He speaks often of the pain that you and Agent Simmons have had to suffer, having lost so many friends...
Lincoln Campbell,
Andrew Garner, Antoine Triplett...
Okay, stop it, stop.
You don't have to list them.
Sorry.
The hope is that I will be able to prevent future tragedies... save the lives of agents by putting myself in harm's way in their place.
- To kill?
- No.
I am incapable of that.
I will protect.
I will serve as a decoy target, a safeguard...
- ...a shield.
- Okay.
T-Turn her off.
We can't tell Simmons about this.
What?
Don't we want to move forward?
Her approval is...
This is too dangerous to show the new Director.
We don't know what he'd do with it.
And she would have to tell him, so... she can't know.
- Not until...
- Until...?
Until she's perfect.
They're walking in now, six.
Really convivial-looking fellows.
At least four of them are packing.
We should be tapped into surveillance now.
Let's see what we get.
Where are the other two men?
We had to leave them at the pick-up site.
Explain.
Those guys were transferring the box into the armored transport.
Maybe they peeked inside or something.
But they went berserk and tore into each other.
There was blood everywhere.
We put two bullets in each of them and locked them in the truck.
No, no.
Look, we were freaking out.
We had to get out of there!
Did you burn their bodies or dump the truck in the ocean?
Because if not, they can be traced back here.
They probably saw what was in this box and were fighting over it, you idiot!
I have been told it's powerful enough to bring our new enhanced enemies to their knees.
We get on comms and call the Zephyr for backup, headquarters will know we're on Daisy's trail.
No orders to pull out.
She's been tracking this sale.
- She could show up here any minute.
- I don't know.
Let's let this play out, see if anyone else makes an appearance.
Excuse me.
Uh, the yard's closing.
To sell a junker, you can call the number on the gate.
Oh, no, I'm not here for that.
I, uh...
Uh, sorry.
What's your name?
Robbie.
Well, Robbie, I am looking for a guy with a sweet black '69 Charger.
Maybe he bought some parts here.
Sorry.
Doesn't ring a bell.
I only work nights once a week.
Uh, well, maybe I'll...
I'll come back in the morning.
Thank you.
Or... there's a book of sales you can flip through in the main office.
Not really an office.
More of a trailer, but I can show you.
That would be great, thank you.
The hell...?
What was that?
A breath of fresh air.
Get away from me!
That's it there.
- So, you live around here?
- No, I used to.
I'm just in town for a couple days, soaking up the sun.
Strange place to spend your vacation.
Not a great neighborhood.
So... you've got the devil inside you, too.
What's going on, guys?
Call for backup, yeah?
We can't wait for Daisy.
These guys might kill somebody besides each other.
Yeah.
Us.
Z One, we got a situation.
We need a little help here.
That was efficient.
You guys know what to do.
Damn.
All clear.
You shouldn't have gotten involved.
Serial killers always complain when we try to intervene.
I only kill asesinos who deserve it.
It's vengeance, chica.
For what?
You killed a detective.
But he had blood on his hands.
- A teacher!
- A pedophile.
You don't get to decide who deserves to die.
I'm not the one who decides.
Do it.
I deserve it.
Do it.
Hey.
Thank for the ride, Janet.
You never accept rides.
Bus break down?
Or you still trying to holler at Janet's little sister?
Maybe.
I only needed a ride to help Canelo balance some books because my brother didn't finish high school.
Yo, I finished high school...
in the 11th grade.
"Everyone's attached to something."
- Spent a lot of time in here?
- Too much.
My wallet's starting to get sick of it.
Your little side mission didn't go unnoticed.
Well, you showed up, so, yeah.
The Director will want to have words with you at H.Q.
- No Daisy, huh?
- No.
But she was tracking these guys, so maybe this is a win.
I don't know.
The ground team is checking for contagion, but hopefully, whatever messed with these guys' heads is no longer an issue.
We're gonna analyze the box it came in.
It's good... to have a moment, just us.
It's been a long time since we had a moment alone.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
Just a long day.
Well, take advantage of the down time.
Who knows what tomorrow holds?
It's coming!
Get ready!
Go, man, go!
Damn it!
Damn it!
Engine's dead!
Get it.
Kill it!
Shoot anything that moves.
Help.
He ...
He got me.
He'll kill us all.
Give me that damn thing.
Get back!
Shoot it!
Shoot it now!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No, please!
No!
4x01 - "The Ghost"
You need to sacrifice everything if you want to survive.
Hmm.
That's funny.
'Cause I thought I would just...
Mm.
Yeah, that's one way to go.
Want a beer?
It's 6:00 in the morning.
What, are you Hemingway?
No, is that real?
When did we cross the North Pole?
An hour ago.
Oh, my gosh.
It's hard to keep track in this thing.
We shouldn't have to stay on clock when we're moving through time zones.
I mean, what is that ...
three continents in two days?
If you count Berlin.
We were only there three hours.
Yeah, we knew that Inhuman call was a hoax as soon as we stepped foot in the apartment, saw that bong.
- I could smell it from the hallway.
- Jokers.
Hungry for attention.
And potato chips.
If the munchies was a superpower, they'd be signing the Sokovia Accords as we speak.
You should let me work on Lola.
I warned you.
Everything in Lola is custom.
Yeah, yeah, everything is custom.
But it would be something to do.
There's only so many times a guy can win cash off you... sir.
You got to stop calling me that.
- We're being called back to H.Q.
- They say why?
We're not due for a restock for another 10 days.
- No idea.
They said it's classified.
- Oh, everything is nowadays.
All right, we'll need full inventory.
Medical, provisions, fuel cells, and make sure you tell the crew they'll need to call ahead if they want off our next deployment.
Agent Thompson...
- Wonder what that's about.
- Oh, I don't know.
- It'll be good to see Fitz and Simmons.
- And May.
Yeah...
I think you look forward to that more than I do.
Hyah!
What was his mistake?
You know I'm not gonna talk.
He didn't anticipate your back kick.
Opened himself up.
His mistake was he tapped out.
- Piper.
- Okay, people!
What, you never seen the biggest plane ever built before?
!
Next pairing, on the mat!
- How long has it been?
- Six weeks in the air.
Only the Quinjet touched down.
- Is that a record for Zephyr One?
- It is.
It was supposed to be even longer.
- You know who called us in?
- I do.
You?
Okay.
Now I know something's up.
I got word from contacts in law enforcement, Los Angeles.
Two civilians were violently killed.
Mysterious burns, heads bashed in, spine pulled out of his ...
Wow.
Many conflicting accounts, but all agree... it was odd.
Odd?
Isn't that our wheelhouse?
He's right.
Why call us in?
We could be headed to the scene right now to confirm the presence of an enhanced person,
- if there is one.
- If it checks out, we bag and tag.
We handle these on the fly.
Didn't exactly want to send this out on the wire.
May, you're not sharing again.
Now would be a really good time to share.
The police also have another victim in custody.
Critical condition.
Under sedation, he mentioned seeing a girl, saying it was the one from the news.
Quake.
Which you didn't want to send over the wire.
You were pulled off Daisy's case.
The Director thinks she slipped through our fingers too many times.
The Director thinks you let her.
No, we pursued her.
She was a ghost.
Well, in his infinite wisdom, he says you're now forbidden to.
But you're telling us this because... ?
In case we want to do something about it.
Look, I can bury this until the official police report comes through.
That'll buy us a few hours lead time.
Get to L.A., sniff around.
Yeah.
We have an active Inhuman asset in Los Angeles that's due for a check-in soon enough.
It'll justify our presence there, but as soon as the report's filed, they'll pull us out.
And the armed forces will be sent in after her.
With orders to kill.
- To kill?
- If she's responsible for these bodies.
- That's not Daisy's M.O.
- The world knows her as Quake, and Quake is an outlaw who takes down banks and bridges.
- Oh, come on.
We both know
- She's hunting violent radicals.
she's tracking these fanatics, the Watchdogs, trying to take down their funding, their ... their escape routes.
Regardless, you should fuel up and get back up in the air ASAP.
Find her before the military does something bad.
Or Daisy does something worse.
Hey.
You can't be here.
Stop right there.
How are we feeling today?
I've been tracking weapon sales, and I know you were hired to steal one.
You even jacked a big rig to help carry it out.
We were just paid for a smash-and-grab job.
Who was that hunting you?
Open the door!
He nailed me, but we almost got away.
Who was it?
- Did he kill my friends?
- All but one.
But you're gonna have to give me a little bit more if I'm gonna find him alive.
Save him, please, before he gets burned, too.
You'll see your buddy again once you heal up.
- Just tell me what's ...
- No.
No.
It's too late for me.
They say when the Rider burns you he burns your soul.
And a soul can never heal.
Stop right there!
Hello?
Hello?
I hear my voice echo, but it sounds strange in my head.
The detail is amazing.
However, I am 3 feet off the ground.
Wait.
What?
Hold on.
Damn it.
Uh, well, I did adjust the Y axis earlier for some reason.
- What does that look like now?
- Better.
The CPU seems to be handling the high poly count.
Textures are impeccable.
We should build a place to get away ... a meadow or a cottage somewhere.
I wish it were ever this quiet.
Direct-current stimulation.
Creates the other senses like touch and taste but also takes feedback.
So I've just mapped your brain's response ...
Response to the environment.
Of course.
Dr. Radcliffe came up with the architecture?
Yeah.
Yeah, he calls it "The Framework."
But all the transcranial apparatus, that's all me.
No.
Of course, you're brilliant, too.
Of course.
'Cause soon you won't even need the eyewear or the earwear, 'cause it'll all be inside your head.
So May's strike team will be able to train virtually instead of May constantly breaking their ribs.
Hey, hey.
Authorized personnel only, pal.
No pass, no entry.
- Who the hell are you?
- Leave them be, Nathanson.
They have more reason to be here than you do.
Wow.
A lot of new faces.
Good to see yours.
Six weeks.
That's a record.
- Heard you got a promotion.
- Oh, yeah, and a title.
Yeah, Special Advisor to the Director in Science and Technology.
Or "SADIST."
- They keeping you busy?
- With busywork, mostly.
Yeah, and random state-of-the-art lie-detector tests.
So that's the cost of being in the Director's inner circle.
Yeah, he's paranoid about what happened the last time S.H.I.E.L.D. was government-run.
Calls it his Widespread Infiltration Monitoring Program.
Or "WIMP." Hey, uh, you should join us 'cause we're gonna go to Radcliffe's and watch the
Aberdeen-Inverness Caley Thistle League cup final.
They're ...
Those are football teams.
I'm not sure they are, Turbo.
Unfortunately, we have to be wheels-up in 10 minutes, so...
Okay.
All right.
Well, strictly business, then.
Aw, yeah.
New toys?
The exploding pen that you asked for.
I can't imagine a use for it.
You never wanted one?
And for you, Direct... uh, Agent Coulson with new bells and whistles.
And the directions will be there when you boot it up.
What's, uh ...
What's the assignment?
- It's classified.
- Right.
Everything is these days.
- Fitz, sadly, um...
- Yeah, you can't make the match, either.
- I have to finish my reports.
- Yeah, no, I get it.
That's okay.
Just a shame we hardly get to see each other.
- Any of us.
- Yes, well...
At least it's better than the friends we'll never see again.
_
_
We just stole a box.
I don't even know what was inside of it.
We ...
We loaded it onto an 18-wheeler, we parked it in a warehouse, and we just left it.
Left it for who?
The Chinatown Crew.
They set the job up and were willing to pay big.
Lies.
Aryan Brotherhood working with the Chinese?
I swear!
I swear that's all I know.
Where's this warehouse?
I ...
I can't tell you that, man.
My people are gonna be mowed down in the payback ... the ones you didn't already kill.
If you don't tell me, you'll have to tell him.
This guy's missing.
The rest are dead.
Aryan Brotherhood.
They're not my kind of brothers.
They've been know to work for cash.
Burglary, assault ... sort of the value meal of hired guns.
They're suspected in the recent theft of this big rig.
- Probably prepping for a larger score.
- Big, yellow, hard to hide.
So, what, are we looking for this thing?
And if Daisy's chasing the same angle, maybe we get to the finish line first.
I'll greet her when she arrives.
- Agent Coulson?
- Davis.
Preparing for decent.
Inhuman asset will be waiting on the tarmac.
What?
- How's your wife, Davis?
- Getting bigger every day.
- Oh.
Don't tell her that.
- More beautiful every day.
There you go.
Mack.
Yo-Yo.
- Just have a few questions.
- I'm all yours.
Uh, so, I see you went to Colombia for a week.
Mm-hmm.
Mm.
And, uh, tickets to Miami coming up.
Yes.
Do you watch me sleep or shower or... ?
Just procedure.
You don't have to use a satellite to get to know me better.
Just ask me to dinner again.
You know the rules about fraternizing with assets in the field.
Oh, we haven't fraternized anything yet.
And I thought you were breaking the rules, coming to do my checkup early just to see me.
Or are you here because, uh, there's been a lot of little earthquakes lately?
Daisy could be in the area.
But officially, that's not the mission.
Doesn't matter.
We'll never find her.
She's always one step ahead.
What is the official mission?
Can I help?
Here's where I have to remind you that Sokovia Accords,
- which you signed...
- Oh, all right.
... require approval by the United Nations subcommittee...
- before an enhanced indiv...
- Rules, rules, rules.
Blah, blah, blah.
S.H.I.E.L.D. moves too slow now, Turtleman.
- I prefer to move fast.
- Uh...
Mack, they found the truck.
Good to see you, too, Coulson!
Well, if you're in Miami, look me up.
Just because we can't work together doesn't mean we can't live a little.
Hey, just in time.
They've just taken to the pitch.
Where's Jemma?
Is she not coming?
Yeah, she wanted to.
Same story.
All work and no play, huh?
That's a bit disappointing.
Still, make yourself comfortable.
I'm just, uh, finishing cleaning up.
Yeah, should be pretty lopsided, don't you think?
Their keeper's absolutely crap...
Oh, my gosh!
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I had no idea there was somebody here.
Hello.
You ...
You weren't meant to see that.
Hello.
I'm glad to final...
- Hello.
I'm glad to final...
- Fitz, meet Aida.
- Hello.
I'm glad to final...
- She's, uh, crashed.
Hello.
I'm glad to final...
Hello.
I'm glad to final...
Hello.
I'm glad to final...
Hello.
I'm glad to final...
Hello.
I'm glad to final...
Hello.
I'm glad to final...
- What the hell?
- Well, I've just upped her PSU to compensate for image processing.
Must have overcranked it.
I'll reboot.
Unh-unh, that's not what I meant.
I meant...
- ...what the hell?
!
- Well, you've already met Aida, digital personal assistant, as a voice on the computer.
So, uh...
- I built her a body.
- Yeah, a naked body.
I-I was just now installing new hardware, updating her gyroscopic sensors.
I'm not some sicko.
When did you build this?
Have you forgotten the very strict stipulations that came with your pardon?
You are not allowed experimentation
- without approval and oversight!
- Oversight, I know.
I'm well aware of that, yeah.
That's why I wanted Simmons here.
I wanted to show both of you.
Look.
This has been a lifelong dream of mine, Fitz.
When I saw the work you and Simmons were doing in replicating human tissue and internal bone structure in Coulson's hand, I knew ...
I knew right then that this was within reach.
- A robot?
- Not just a robot.
It's one that can cross the uncanny valley and come out the other side ...
pass for a human.
I mean, it has bloody micro-expressions.
She.
It's a ...
It's definitely a "she" 'cause I saw ...
- Yes...
- She has micro-expressions, full range of motion.
I mean, physically, it's ...
- she's nearly perfect.
- She is very realistic.
Now, mentally, well, you've spoken with Aida.
She's bright, she laughs at the jokes
I programmed her to recognize, but she's never pass the Turing test.
At the moment, that's a pipe dream.
However, I think, with your help...
No, no.
No, no, no, no!
We have to report this right away.
- You could lose everything.
- I know.
- Or you could go to jail.
- I know!
I know, you're right.
Full disclosure at this time is the best course of action.
I ...
I agree.
Hmm.
At least let me show you how it works.
They're in town.
I supposed you guessed that, texting me.
They're looking for a truck.
That mean you have something for me?
They watch my every move, but certain moves they can't see.
You can't get these over the counter.
S.H.I.E.L.D. issue for rapid bone healing, yes?
I know you splintered your bones when you first powered up.
- Are you pushing yourself too hard?
- Don't worry about me.
You can't use your powers too much.
- Your body will break down.
- I'm fine.
I'm surprised you're still in town.
You're usually moving and moving.
Are you, uh, still hunting those perros rabiosos?
It's not just the Watchdogs now.
Local gangs have been working for them, which I... don't understand.
I was tracing the sale of a weapon, and I...
I think I may have stumbled upon a serial killer.
Ooh.
Fun.
He live around here?
He mostly hits this area, but he's hard to track down, leaves no traces behind, operates alone.
Sound familiar?
I thought maybe you were, uh, growing roots, they say.
- L.A. used to be where you hang out, no?
- No roots.
Everyone gets attached to something eventually.
Don't forget to wait two stops after I get off.
Yeah, yeah.
Hey.
Send me a picture of this guy.
Maybe I can cover some ground if I know what he looks like.
No, I still haven't gotten a good look at him yet, so just...
take care of yourself, okay?
But thank you for the S.H.I.E.L.D. intel.
They won't give up on you, especially Coulson.
All he wants is to find you.
Well, that's too bad, 'cause there's only one thing I want.
Oh, yeah?
What's that?
Nothing to lose.
Here's the Mapping-Action Eyewear you requested.
Should help your team in case of a blind takedown.
- Great.
Thanks.
- I need you to sign for it.
I don't get the new color-coded security-level rainbow of...
- What's it called?
- The "Spectrum of Security."
Why do I, level red, have to go through you, level orange, to request hardware?
Shouldn't red be higher than orange?
Well, orange encompasses both red and yellow, so...
It's hard to explain, but the Director didn't want to use numbers because he didn't want any team member to feel less than.
Well, you do have a higher clearance than me.
Only in most instances.
I feel less than.
Hey, we just had a report come in.
A death in a hospital in Los Angeles.
Suspicious circumstances.
Suspect is an Asian female.
You think it might be Daisy.
I'm going to look into it.
I just wondered if you'd heard anything from your law-enforcement contacts?
I'm mostly in the dark these days.
Why don't you ask the Director?
Since you're one of the few people allowed or willing to do that.
What you got there?
Didn't hear?
Word is, he hit again last night.
- Two dead in the street.
- Who?
Ghost Rider.
You must not be from around here.
Do you know where I can find him?
Nobody does.
Everybody that sees his face ends up on this wall.
"Everyone gets attached to something."
We got to get this truck out of here.
What are you, the Feds?
Something like that.
We'll be sealing the scene.
Not for long, I hope.
I was just gonna have this guy tow this thing away so me and my crew can get back to work.
We got this.
This warehouse usually sits empty.
We were gonna store some inventory today.
Found the lock broken and this big, honkin' thing inside.
- Have at it.
- Thank you.
Not fair.
You want tech like this, you should've cut off your own hand.
Mack.
Okay.
Looks like these guys tore each other apart.
Zhang Wei, resident of Monterey Park.
Organ donor.
Say anything about him being a flesh-hungry rage monster?
Uh, no, I'm not seeing anything about that here, so we have to assume that he wasn't until he came in contact with whatever's in that trailer.
Not much here that'll lead us anywhere.
Well... there's that.
There was no buyer there.
No, no, no.
No!
Please, God, no!
No!
I don't deserve to die!
- No!
No!
- Everyone says that.
No!
No!
No!
Yeah, those chargers are hard to find.
Between "Fast and Furious" and "Dukes of Hazzard,"
they wrecked a lot of them.
My boyfriend wrecked his in a street race.
He's pretty broken up.
I guess he was more attached to it than I thought.
I ain't seen none around here, though.
- Sorry.
- All right.
Thanks, man.
Hey, uh, most of them wrecked movie cars, they're dumped at El Monte Junk and Salvage.
If your boyfriend wants to fix his ride up, might want to go over there and find scraps.
Thanks.
Maybe he'll go there.
Daisy's in Los Angeles.
There was an eyewitness, now dead, and I just received Yo-Yo's check-in report a week early, which means Coulson and Mack are there, too,
- no doubt, trying to track Daisy down.
- Sounds right.
You know it is, because according to the logs, you called Coulson back to H.Q. for resupply yourself.
Why, if not to give him that intel in person, knowing it's against the Director's orders?
I didn't send them.
I don't have the authority.
- They acted on their own.
- You knew I'd find out.
Why not tell me?
I have daily lie detection.
- That's why.
- And now I have to report it, which means now I either look like I'm incompetent
- or colluding with you.
- Wouldn't want you falling out of favor with the director.
Okay.
I get it.
It's abundantly clear you're uncomfortable with my new position ...
I just want to know how comfortable you are with it.
You actually trust this guy?
Our team split up to lead departments, given different colors.
'Cause we're experts?
No.
I think the Director broke up the band on purpose.
Of course he did!
As soon as Talbot gave the location of this base to the president, things changed.
I knew we'd be divided, undermined, kept in the dark, so I have been clawing for as much power as I can possibly grab to keep a modicum of control over any of this.
After all we've been through...
I don't trust the new Director, but he trusts me, so now, in order to keep that trust,
I must take the appropriate action to address this break in protocol.
I'm sending you and your strike team to take Coulson and Mack out of the field, by force, if necessary.
Clean up whatever mess he's in.
- That's an order.
- Yes, ma'am.
Place them at the four corners of the exterior of the building.
That'll give us visuals through the walls.
This could be very dangerous.
- So much could go wrong.
- Ultron, yes.
I know.
But this is not A.I. A.I. is banned, and that's good.
This is mimicry of human behavior.
Still, in the wrong hands, this could be used as a weapon.
- Is that the idea?
- No, absolutely not.
No ...
Look, I know the dangers.
That's why I've been ...
I've been reticent to divulge.
I don't know these new people at S.H.I.E.L.D.
But a weapon is absolutely not the idea.
Well, then, why?
What's she for?
Why not let Aida tell you herself?
Hello.
I'm glad to finally shake your hand, Leopold.
Where's Jemma?
We were hoping that she would come.
S-She's, uh...
indisposed, I'm afraid.
Aida...
- I was wondering ...
- Yes, Agent Fitz?
I was wondering if you could tell me exactly what it is you are designed for.
Of course.
Dr. Radcliffe, time and again, has expressed his deep regret for causing pain when all he ever wanted was to prevent it.
He speaks often of the pain that you and Agent Simmons have had to suffer, having lost so many friends ...
Lincoln Campbell,
Andrew Garner, Antoine Triplett ...
Okay, stop it, stop.
You don't have to list them.
Sorry.
The hope is that I will be able to prevent future tragedies ... save the lives of agents by putting myself in harm's way in their place.
- To kill?
- No.
I am incapable of that.
I will protect.
I will serve as a decoy target, a safeguard...
- ... a shield.
- Okay.
T-Turn her off.
We can't tell Simmons about this.
What?
Don't we want to move forward?
Her approval is ...
This is too dangerous to show the new Director.
We don't know what he'd do with it.
And she would have to tell him, so... she can't know.
- Not until...
- Until... ?
Until she's perfect.
They're walking in now, six.
Really convivial-looking fellows.
At least four of them are packing.
We should be tapped into surveillance now.
Let's see what we get.
Where are the other two men?
We had to leave them at the pick-up site.
Explain.
Those guys were transferring the box into the armored transport.
Maybe they peeked inside or something.
But they went berserk and tore into each other.
There was blood everywhere.
We put two bullets in each of them and locked them in the truck.
No, no.
Look, we were freaking out.
We had to get out of there!
Did you burn their bodies or dump the truck in the ocean?
Because if not, they can be traced back here.
They probably saw what was in this box and were fighting over it, you idiot!
I have been told it's powerful enough to bring our new enhanced enemies to their knees.
We get on comms and call the Zephyr for backup, headquarters will know we're on Daisy's trail.
No orders to pull out.
She's been tracking this sale.
- She could show up here any minute.
- I don't know.
Let's let this play out, see if anyone else makes an appearance.
Excuse me.
Uh, the yard's closing.
To sell a junker, you can call the number on the gate.
Oh, no, I'm not here for that.
I, uh ...
Uh, sorry.
What's your name?
Robbie.
Well, Robbie, I am looking for a guy with a sweet black '69 Charger.
Maybe he bought some parts here.
Sorry.
Doesn't ring a bell.
I only work nights once a week.
Uh, well, maybe I'll ...
I'll come back in the morning.
Thank you.
Or...
there's a book of sales you can flip through in the main office.
Not really an office.
More of a trailer, but I can show you.
That would be great, thank you.
The hell... ?
What was that?
A breath of fresh air.
Get away from me!
That's it there.
- So, you live around here?
- No, I used to.
I'm just in town for a couple days, soaking up the sun.
Strange place to spend your vacation.
Not a great neighborhood.
So... you've got the devil inside you, too.
What's going on, guys?
Call for backup, yeah?
We can't wait for Daisy.
These guys might kill somebody besides each other.
Yeah.
Us.
Z One, we got a situation.
We need a little help here.
That was efficient.
You guys know what to do.
Damn.
All clear.
You shouldn't have gotten involved.
Serial killers always complain when we try to intervene.
I only kill asesinos who deserve it.
It's vengeance, chica.
For what?
You killed a detective.
But he had blood on his hands.
- A teacher!
- A pedophile.
You don't get to decide who deserves to die.
I'm not the one who decides.
Do it.
I deserve it.
Do it.
Hey.
Thank for the ride, Janet.
You never accept rides.
Bus break down?
Or you still trying to holler at Janet's little sister?
Maybe.
I only needed a ride to help Canelo balance some books because my brother didn't finish high school.
Yo, I finished high school...
in the 11th grade.
"Everyone's attached to something."
We'll return in a moment.
- Spent a lot of time in here?
- Too much.
My wallet's starting to get sick of it.
Your little side mission didn't go unnoticed.
Well, you showed up, so, yeah.
The Director will want to have words with you at H.Q.
- No Daisy, huh?
- No.
But she was tracking these guys, so maybe this is a win.
I don't know.
The ground team is checking for contagion, but hopefully, whatever messed with these guys' heads is no longer an issue.
We're gonna analyze the box it came in.
It's good...
to have a moment, just us.
It's been a long time since we had a moment alone.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
Just a long day.
Well, take advantage of the down time.
Who knows what tomorrow holds?
It's coming!
Get ready!
Go, man, go!
Aah!
Damn it!
Damn it!
Engine's dead!
Get it.
Kill it!
Shoot anything that moves.
Help.
He...
He got me.
He'll kill us all.
Give me that damn thing.
Get back!
Shoot it!
Shoot it now!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No, please!
No!
4x01 - "The Ghost"
You need to sacrifice everything if you want to survive.
Hmm.
That's funny.
'Cause I thought I would just...
Mm.
Yeah, that's one way to go.
Want a beer?
It's 6:00 in the morning.
What, are you Hemingway?
No, is that real?
When did we cross the North Pole?
An hour ago.
Oh, my gosh.
It's hard to keep track in this thing.
We shouldn't have to stay on clock when we're moving through time zones.
I mean, what is that...
three continents in two days?
If you count Berlin.
We were only there three hours.
Yeah, we knew that Inhuman call was a hoax as soon as we stepped foot in the apartment, saw that bong.
- I could smell it from the hallway.
- Jokers.
Hungry for attention.
And potato chips.
If the munchies was a superpower, they'd be signing the Sokovia Accords as we speak.
You should let me work on Lola.
I warned you.
Everything in Lola is custom.
Yeah, yeah, everything is custom.
But it would be something to do.
There's only so many times a guy can win cash off you... sir.
You got to stop calling me that.
- We're being called back to H.Q.
- They say why?
We're not due for a restock for another 10 days.
- No idea.
They said it's classified.
- Oh, everything is nowadays.
All right, we'll need full inventory.
Medical, provisions, fuel cells, and make sure you tell the crew they'll need to call ahead if they want off our next deployment.
Agent Thompson...
- Wonder what that's about.
- Oh, I don't know.
- It'll be good to see Fitz and Simmons.
- And May.
Yeah...
I think you look forward to that more than I do.
Hyah!
What was his mistake?
You know I'm not gonna talk.
He didn't anticipate your back kick.
Opened himself up.
His mistake was he tapped out.
- Piper.
- Okay, people!
What, you never seen the biggest plane ever built before?
!
Next pairing, on the mat!
- How long has it been?
- Six weeks in the air.
Only the Quinjet touched down.
- Is that a record for Zephyr One?
- It is.
It was supposed to be even longer.
- You know who called us in?
- I do.
You?
Okay.
Now I know something's up.
I got word from contacts in law enforcement, Los Angeles.
Two civilians were violently killed.
Mysterious burns, heads bashed in, spine pulled out of his...
Wow.
Many conflicting accounts, but all agree... it was odd.
Odd?
Isn't that our wheelhouse?
He's right.
Why call us in?
We could be headed to the scene right now to confirm the presence of an enhanced person,
- if there is one.
- If it checks out, we bag and tag.
We handle these on the fly.
Didn't exactly want to send this out on the wire.
May, you're not sharing again.
Now would be a really good time to share.
The police also have another victim in custody.
Critical condition.
Under sedation, he mentioned seeing a girl, saying it was the one from the news.
Quake.
Which you didn't want to send over the wire.
You were pulled off Daisy's case.
The Director thinks she slipped through our fingers too many times.
The Director thinks you let her.
No, we pursued her.
She was a ghost.
Well, in his infinite wisdom, he says you're now forbidden to.
But you're telling us this because...?
In case we want to do something about it.
Look, I can bury this until the official police report comes through.
That'll buy us a few hours lead time.
Get to L.A., sniff around.
Yeah.
We have an active Inhuman asset in Los Angeles that's due for a check-in soon enough.
It'll justify our presence there, but as soon as the report's filed, they'll pull us out.
And the armed forces will be sent in after her.
With orders to kill.
- To kill?
- If she's responsible for these bodies.
- That's not Daisy's M.O.
- The world knows her as Quake, and Quake is an outlaw who takes down banks and bridges.
- Oh, come on.
We both know
- She's hunting violent radicals.
She's tracking these fanatics, the Watchdogs, trying to take down their funding, their... their escape routes.
Regardless, you should fuel up and get back up in the air ASAP.
Find her before the military does something bad.
Or Daisy does something worse.
Hey.
You can't be here.
Stop right there.
How are we feeling today?
I've been tracking weapon sales, and I know you were hired to steal one.
You even jacked a big rig to help carry it out.
We were just paid for a smash-and-grab job.
Who was that hunting you?
Man:
Open the door!
He nailed me, but we almost got away.
Who was it?
- Did he kill my friends?
- All but one.
But you're gonna have to give me a little bit more if I'm gonna find him alive.
Save him, please, before he gets burned, too.
You'll see your buddy again once you heal up.
- Just tell me what's...
- No.
No.
It's too late for me.
They say when the Rider burns you he burns your soul.
And a soul can never heal.
Stop right there!
Hello?
Hello?
I hear my voice echo, but it sounds strange in my head.
The detail is amazing.
However, I am 3 feet off the ground.
Wait.
What?
Hold on.
Damn it.
Uh, well, I did adjust the Y axis earlier for some reason.
- What does that look like now?
- Better.
The CPU seems to be handling the high poly count.
Textures are impeccable.
We should build a place to get away... a meadow or a cottage somewhere.
I wish it were ever this quiet.
Direct-current stimulation.
Creates the other senses like touch and taste but also takes feedback.
So I've just mapped your brain's response...
Response to the environment.
Of course.
Dr. Radcliffe came up with the architecture?
Yeah.
Yeah, he calls it "The Framework."
But all the transcranial apparatus, that's all me.
No.
Of course, you're brilliant, too.
Of course.
'Cause soon you won't even need the eyewear or the earwear, 'cause it'll all be inside your head.
So May's strike team will be able to train virtually instead of May constantly breaking their ribs.
Hey, hey.
Authorized personnel only, pal.
No pass, no entry.
- Who the hell are you?
- Leave them be, Nathanson.
They have more reason to be here than you do.
Wow.
A lot of new faces.
Good to see yours.
Six weeks.
That's a record.
- Heard you got a promotion.
- Oh, yeah, and a title.
Yeah, Special Advisor to the Director in Science and Technology.
Or "SADIST."
- They keeping you busy?
- With busywork, mostly.
Yeah, and random state-of-the-art lie-detector tests.
So that's the cost of being in the Director's inner circle.
Yeah, he's paranoid about what happened the last time S.H.I.E.L.D. was government-run.
Calls it his Widespread Infiltration Monitoring Program.
Or "WIMP." Hey, uh, you should join us 'cause we're gonna go to Radcliffe's and watch the
Aberdeen-Inverness Caley Thistle League cup final.
They're...
Those are football teams.
I'm not sure they are, Turbo.
Unfortunately, we have to be wheels-up in 10 minutes, so...
Okay.
All right.
Well, strictly business, then.
Aw, yeah.
New toys?
The exploding pen that you asked for.
I can't imagine a use for it.
You never wanted one?
And for you, Direct... uh, Agent Coulson with new bells and whistles.
And the directions will be there when you boot it up.
What's, uh...
What's the assignment?
- It's classified.
- Right.
Everything is these days.
- Fitz, sadly, um...
- Yeah, you can't make the match, either.
- I have to finish my reports.
- Yeah, no, I get it.
That's okay.
Just a shame we hardly get to see each other.
- Any of us.
- Yes, well...
At least it's better than the friends we'll never see again.
_
_
We just stole a box.
I don't even know what was inside of it.
We...
We loaded it onto an 18-wheeler, we parked it in a warehouse, and we just left it.
Left it for who?
The Chinatown Crew.
They set the job up and were willing to pay big.
Lies.
Aryan Brotherhood working with the Chinese?
I swear!
I swear that's all I know.
Where's this warehouse?
I...
I can't tell you that, man.
My people are gonna be mowed down in the payback... the ones you didn't already kill.
If you don't tell me, you'll have to tell him.
This guy's missing.
The rest are dead.
Aryan Brotherhood.
They're not my kind of brothers.
They've been know to work for cash.
Burglary, assault... sort of the value meal of hired guns.
They're suspected in the recent theft of this big rig.
- Probably prepping for a larger score.
- Big, yellow, hard to hide.
So, what, are we looking for this thing?
And if Daisy's chasing the same angle, maybe we get to the finish line first.
I'll greet her when she arrives.
- Agent Coulson?
- Davis.
Preparing for decent.
Inhuman asset will be waiting on the tarmac.
What?
- How's your wife, Davis?
- Getting bigger every day.
- Oh.
Don't tell her that.
- More beautiful every day.
There you go.
Mack.
Yo-Yo.
- Just have a few questions.
- I'm all yours.
Uh, so, I see you went to Colombia for a week.
Mm-hmm.
Mm.
And, uh, tickets to Miami coming up.
Yes.
Do you watch me sleep or shower or...?
Just procedure.
You don't have to use a satellite to get to know me better.
Just ask me to dinner again.
You know the rules about fraternizing with assets in the field.
Oh, we haven't fraternized anything yet.
And I thought you were breaking the rules, coming to do my checkup early just to see me.
Or are you here because, uh, there's been a lot of little earthquakes lately?
Daisy could be in the area.
But officially, that's not the mission.
Doesn't matter.
We'll never find her.
She's always one step ahead.
What is the official mission?
Can I help?
Here's where I have to remind you that Sokovia Accords,
- which you signed...
- Oh, all right.
...require approval by the United Nations subcommittee...
- before an enhanced indiv...
- Rules, rules, rules.
Blah, blah, blah.
S.H.I.E.L.D. moves too slow now, Turtleman.
- I prefer to move fast.
- Uh...
Mack, they found the truck.
Good to see you, too, Coulson!
Well, if you're in Miami, look me up.
Just because we can't work together doesn't mean we can't live a little.
Hey, just in time.
They've just taken to the pitch.
Where's Jemma?
Is she not coming?
Yeah, she wanted to.
Same story.
All work and no play, huh?
That's a bit disappointing.
Still, make yourself comfortable.
I'm just, uh, finishing cleaning up.
Yeah, should be pretty lopsided, don't you think?
Their keeper's absolutely crap...
Oh, my gosh!
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I had no idea there was somebody here.
Hello.
You...
You weren't meant to see that.
Hello.
I'm glad to final...
- Hello.
I'm glad to final...
- Fitz, meet Aida.
- Hello.
I'm glad to final...
- She's, uh, crashed.
Hello.
I'm glad to final...
Hello.
I'm glad to final...
Hello.
I'm glad to final...
Hello.
I'm glad to final...
Hello.
I'm glad to final...
Hello.
I'm glad to final...
- What the hell?
- Well, I've just upped her PSU to compensate for image processing.
Must have overcranked it.
I'll reboot.
Unh-unh, that's not what I meant.
I meant...
- ...what the hell?
!
- Well, you've already met Aida, digital personal assistant, as a voice on the computer.
So, uh...
- I built her a body.
- Yeah, a naked body.
I-I was just now installing new hardware, updating her gyroscopic sensors.
I'm not some sicko.
When did you build this?
Have you forgotten the very strict stipulations that came with your pardon?
You are not allowed experimentation
- without approval and oversight!
- Oversight, I know.
I'm well aware of that, yeah.
That's why I wanted Simmons here.
I wanted to show both of you.
Look.
This has been a lifelong dream of mine, Fitz.
When I saw the work you and Simmons were doing in replicating human tissue and internal bone structure in Coulson's hand, I knew...
I knew right then that this was within reach.
- A robot?
- Not just a robot.
It's one that can cross the uncanny valley and come out the other side...
pass for a human.
I mean, it has bloody micro-expressions.
She.
It's a...
It's definitely a "she" 'cause I saw...
- Yes...
- She has micro-expressions, full range of motion.
I mean, physically, it's...
- she's nearly perfect.
- She is very realistic.
Now, mentally, well, you've spoken with Aida.
She's bright, she laughs at the jokes
I programmed her to recognize, but she's never pass the Turing test.
At the moment, that's a pipe dream.
However, I think, with your help...
No, no.
No, no, no, no!
We have to report this right away.
- You could lose everything.
- I know.
- Or you could go to jail.
- I know!
I know, you're right.
Full disclosure at this time is the best course of action.
I...
I agree.
Hmm.
At least let me show you how it works.
They're in town.
I supposed you guessed that, texting me.
They're looking for a truck.
That mean you have something for me?
They watch my every move, but certain moves they can't see.
You can't get these over the counter.
S.H.I.E.L.D. issue for rapid bone healing, yes?
I know you splintered your bones when you first powered up.
- Are you pushing yourself too hard?
- Don't worry about me.
You can't use your powers too much.
- Your body will break down.
- I'm fine.
I'm surprised you're still in town.
You're usually moving and moving.
Are you, uh, still hunting those perros rabiosos?
It's not just the Watchdogs now.
Local gangs have been working for them, which I... don't understand.
I was tracing the sale of a weapon, and I...
I think I may have stumbled upon a serial killer.
Ooh.
Fun.
He live around here?
He mostly hits this area, but he's hard to track down, leaves no traces behind, operates alone.
Sound familiar?
I thought maybe you were, uh, growing roots, they say.
- L.A. used to be where you hang out, no?
- No roots.
Everyone gets attached to something eventually.
Don't forget to wait two stops after I get off.
Yeah, yeah.
Hey.
Send me a picture of this guy.
Maybe I can cover some ground if I know what he looks like.
No, I still haven't gotten a good look at him yet, so just... take care of yourself, okay?
But thank you for the S.H.I.E.L.D. intel.
They won't give up on you, especially Coulson.
All he wants is to find you.
Well, that's too bad, 'cause there's only one thing I want.
Oh, yeah?
What's that?
Nothing to lose.
Here's the Mapping-Action Eyewear you requested.
Should help your team in case of a blind takedown.
- Great.
Thanks.
- I need you to sign for it.
I don't get the new color-coded security-level rainbow of...
- What's it called?
- The "Spectrum of Security."
Why do I, level red, have to go through you, level orange, to request hardware?
Shouldn't red be higher than orange?
Well, orange encompasses both red and yellow, so...
It's hard to explain, but the Director didn't want to use numbers because he didn't want any team member to feel less than.
Well, you do have a higher clearance than me.
Only in most instances.
I feel less than.
Hey, we just had a report come in.
A death in a hospital in Los Angeles.
Suspicious circumstances.
Suspect is an Asian female.
You think it might be Daisy.
I'm going to look into it.
I just wondered if you'd heard anything from your law-enforcement contacts?
I'm mostly in the dark these days.
Why don't you ask the Director?
Since you're one of the few people allowed or willing to do that.
What you got there?
Didn't hear?
Word is, he hit again last night.
- Two dead in the street.
- Who?
Ghost Rider.
You must not be from around here.
Do you know where I can find him?
Nobody does.
Everybody that sees his face ends up on this wall.
"Everyone gets attached to something."
We got to get this truck out of here.
What are you, the Feds?
Something like that.
We'll be sealing the scene.
Not for long, I hope.
I was just gonna have this guy tow this thing away so me and my crew can get back to work.
We got this.
This warehouse usually sits empty.
We were gonna store some inventory today.
Found the lock broken and this big, honkin' thing inside.
- Have at it.
- Thank you.
Not fair.
You want tech like this, you should've cut off your own hand.
Mack.
Okay.
Looks like these guys tore each other apart.
Zhang Wei, resident of Monterey Park.
Organ donor.
Say anything about him being a flesh-hungry rage monster?
Uh, no, I'm not seeing anything about that here, so we have to assume that he wasn't until he came in contact with whatever's in that trailer.
Not much here that'll lead us anywhere.
Well... there's that.
There was no buyer there.
No, no, no.
No!
Please, God, no!
No!
I don't deserve to die!
- No!
No!
- Everyone says that.
No!
No!
No!
Yeah, those chargers are hard to find.
Between "Fast and Furious" and "Dukes of Hazzard,"
they wrecked a lot of them.
My boyfriend wrecked his in a street race.
He's pretty broken up.
I guess he was more attached to it than I thought.
I ain't seen none around here, though.
- Sorry.
- All right.
Thanks, man.
Hey, uh, most of them wrecked movie cars, they're dumped at El Monte Junk and Salvage.
If your boyfriend wants to fix his ride up, might want to go over there and find scraps.
Thanks.
Maybe he'll go there.
Daisy's in Los Angeles.
There was an eyewitness, now dead, and I just received Yo-Yo's check-in report a week early, which means Coulson and Mack are there, too,
- no doubt, trying to track Daisy down.
- Sounds right.
You know it is, because according to the logs, you called Coulson back to H.Q. for resupply yourself.
Why, if not to give him that intel in person, knowing it's against the Director's orders?
I didn't send them.
I don't have the authority.
- They acted on their own.
- You knew I'd find out.
Why not tell me?
I have daily lie detection.
- That's why.
- And now I have to report it, which means now I either look like I'm incompetent
- or colluding with you.
- Wouldn't want you falling out of favor with the director.
Okay.
I get it.
It's abundantly clear you're uncomfortable with my new position...
I just want to know how comfortable you are with it.
You actually trust this guy?
Our team split up to lead departments, given different colors.
'Cause we're experts?
No.
I think the Director broke up the band on purpose.
Of course he did!
As soon as Talbot gave the location of this base to the president, things changed.
I knew we'd be divided, undermined, kept in the dark, so I have been clawing for as much power as I can possibly grab to keep a modicum of control over any of this.
After all we've been through...
I don't trust the new Director, but he trusts me, so now, in order to keep that trust,
I must take the appropriate action to address this break in protocol.
I'm sending you and your strike team to take Coulson and Mack out of the field, by force, if necessary.
Clean up whatever mess he's in.
- That's an order.
- Yes, ma'am.
Place them at the four corners of the exterior of the building.
That'll give us visuals through the walls.
This could be very dangerous.
- So much could go wrong.
- Ultron, yes.
I know.
But this is not A.I. A.I. is banned, and that's good.
This is mimicry of human behavior.
Still, in the wrong hands, this could be used as a weapon.
- Is that the idea?
- No, absolutely not.
No...
Look, I know the dangers.
That's why I've been...
I've been reticent to divulge.
I don't know these new people at S.H.I.E.L.D.
But a weapon is absolutely not the idea.
Well, then, why?
What's she for?
Why not let Aida tell you herself?
Hello.
I'm glad to finally shake your hand, Leopold.
Where's Jemma?
We were hoping that she would come.
S-She's, uh... indisposed, I'm afraid.
Aida...
- I was wondering...
- Yes, Agent Fitz?
I was wondering if you could tell me exactly what it is you are designed for.
Of course.
Dr. Radcliffe, time and again, has expressed his deep regret for causing pain when all he ever wanted was to prevent it.
He speaks often of the pain that you and Agent Simmons have had to suffer, having lost so many friends...
Lincoln Campbell,
Andrew Garner, Antoine Triplett...
Okay, stop it, stop.
You don't have to list them.
Sorry.
The hope is that I will be able to prevent future tragedies... save the lives of agents by putting myself in harm's way in their place.
- To kill?
- No.
I am incapable of that.
I will protect.
I will serve as a decoy target, a safeguard...
- ...a shield.
- Okay.
T-Turn her off.
We can't tell Simmons about this.
What?
Don't we want to move forward?
Her approval is...
This is too dangerous to show the new Director.
We don't know what he'd do with it.
And she would have to tell him, so... she can't know.
- Not until...
- Until...?
Until she's perfect.
They're walking in now, six.
Really convivial-looking fellows.
At least four of them are packing.
We should be tapped into surveillance now.
Let's see what we get.
Where are the other two men?
We had to leave them at the pick-up site.
Explain.
Those guys were transferring the box into the armored transport.
Maybe they peeked inside or something.
But they went berserk and tore into each other.
There was blood everywhere.
We put two bullets in each of them and locked them in the truck.
No, no.
Look, we were freaking out.
We had to get out of there!
Did you burn their bodies or dump the truck in the ocean?
Because if not, they can be traced back here.
They probably saw what was in this box and were fighting over it, you idiot!
I have been told it's powerful enough to bring our new enhanced enemies to their knees.
We get on comms and call the Zephyr for backup, headquarters will know we're on Daisy's trail.
No orders to pull out.
She's been tracking this sale.
- She could show up here any minute.
- I don't know.
Let's let this play out, see if anyone else makes an appearance.
Excuse me.
Uh, the yard's closing.
To sell a junker, you can call the number on the gate.
Oh, no, I'm not here for that.
I, uh...
Uh, sorry.
What's your name?
Robbie.
Well, Robbie, I am looking for a guy with a sweet black '69 Charger.
Maybe he bought some parts here.
Sorry.
Doesn't ring a bell.
I only work nights once a week.
Uh, well, maybe I'll...
I'll come back in the morning.
Thank you.
Or... there's a book of sales you can flip through in the main office.
Not really an office.
More of a trailer, but I can show you.
That would be great, thank you.
The hell...?
What was that?
A breath of fresh air.
Get away from me!
That's it there.
- So, you live around here?
- No, I used to.
I'm just in town for a couple days, soaking up the sun.
Strange place to spend your vacation.
Not a great neighborhood.
So... you've got the devil inside you, too.
What's going on, guys?
Call for backup, yeah?
We can't wait for Daisy.
These guys might kill somebody besides each other.
Yeah.
Us.
Z One, we got a situation.
We need a little help here.
That was efficient.
You guys know what to do.
Damn.
All clear.
You shouldn't have gotten involved.
Serial killers always complain when we try to intervene.
I only kill asesinos who deserve it.
It's vengeance, chica.
For what?
You killed a detective.
But he had blood on his hands.
- A teacher!
- A pedophile.
You don't get to decide who deserves to die.
I'm not the one who decides.
Do it.
I deserve it.
Do it.
Hey.
Thank for the ride, Janet.
You never accept rides.
Bus break down?
Or you still trying to holler at Janet's little sister?
Maybe.
I only needed a ride to help Canelo balance some books because my brother didn't finish high school.
Yo, I finished high school...
in the 11th grade.
"Everyone's attached to something."
- Spent a lot of time in here?
- Too much.
My wallet's starting to get sick of it.
Your little side mission didn't go unnoticed.
Well, you showed up, so, yeah.
The Director will want to have words with you at H.Q.
- No Daisy, huh?
- No.
But she was tracking these guys, so maybe this is a win.
I don't know.
The ground team is checking for contagion, but hopefully, whatever messed with these guys' heads is no longer an issue.
We're gonna analyze the box it came in.
It's good... to have a moment, just us.
It's been a long time since we had a moment alone.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
Just a long day.
Well, take advantage of the down time.
Who knows what tomorrow holds?
It's coming!
Get ready!
Go, man, go!
Damn it!
Damn it!
Engine's dead!
Get it.
Kill it!
Shoot anything that moves.
Help.
He ...
He got me.
He'll kill us all.
Give me that damn thing.
Get back!
Shoot it!
Shoot it now!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No, please!
No!

You need to sacrifice everything if you want to survive.
Hmm.
That's funny.
'Cause I thought I would just...
Mm.
Yeah, that's one way to go.
Want a beer?
It's 6:00 in the morning.
What, are you Hemingway?
No, is that real?
When did we cross the North Pole?
An hour ago.
Oh, my gosh.
It's hard to keep track in this thing.
We shouldn't have to stay on clock when we're moving through time zones.
I mean, what is that ...
three continents in two days?
If you count Berlin.
We were only there three hours.
Yeah, we knew that Inhuman call was a hoax as soon as we stepped foot in the apartment, saw that bong.
- I could smell it from the hallway.
- Jokers.
Hungry for attention.
And potato chips.
If the munchies was a superpower, they'd be signing the Sokovia Accords as we speak.
You should let me work on Lola.
I warned you.
Everything in Lola is custom.
Yeah, yeah, everything is custom.
But it would be something to do.
There's only so many times a guy can win cash off you... sir.
You got to stop calling me that.
- We're being called back to H.Q.
- They say why?
We're not due for a restock for another 10 days.
- No idea.
They said it's classified.
- Oh, everything is nowadays.
All right, we'll need full inventory.
Medical, provisions, fuel cells, and make sure you tell the crew they'll need to call ahead if they want off our next deployment.
Agent Thompson...
- Wonder what that's about.
- Oh, I don't know.
- It'll be good to see Fitz and Simmons.
- And May.
Yeah...
I think you look forward to that more than I do.
Hyah!
What was his mistake?
You know I'm not gonna talk.
He didn't anticipate your back kick.
Opened himself up.
His mistake was he tapped out.
- Piper.
- Okay, people!
What, you never seen the biggest plane ever built before?
!
Next pairing, on the mat!
- How long has it been?
- Six weeks in the air.
Only the Quinjet touched down.
- Is that a record for Zephyr One?
- It is.
It was supposed to be even longer.
- You know who called us in?
- I do.
You?
Okay.
Now I know something's up.
I got word from contacts in law enforcement, Los Angeles.
Two civilians were violently killed.
Mysterious burns, heads bashed in, spine pulled out of his ...
Wow.
Many conflicting accounts, but all agree... it was odd.
Odd?
Isn't that our wheelhouse?
He's right.
Why call us in?
We could be headed to the scene right now to confirm the presence of an enhanced person,
- if there is one.
- If it checks out, we bag and tag.
We handle these on the fly.
Didn't exactly want to send this out on the wire.
May, you're not sharing again.
Now would be a really good time to share.
The police also have another victim in custody.
Critical condition.
Under sedation, he mentioned seeing a girl, saying it was the one from the news.
Quake.
Which you didn't want to send over the wire.
You were pulled off Daisy's case.
The Director thinks she slipped through our fingers too many times.
The Director thinks you let her.
No, we pursued her.
She was a ghost.
Well, in his infinite wisdom, he says you're now forbidden to.
But you're telling us this because... ?
In case we want to do something about it.
Look, I can bury this until the official police report comes through.
That'll buy us a few hours lead time.
Get to L.A., sniff around.
Yeah.
We have an active Inhuman asset in Los Angeles that's due for a check-in soon enough.
It'll justify our presence there, but as soon as the report's filed, they'll pull us out.
And the armed forces will be sent in after her.
With orders to kill.
- To kill?
- If she's responsible for these bodies.
- That's not Daisy's M.O.
- The world knows her as Quake, and Quake is an outlaw who takes down banks and bridges.
- Oh, come on.
We both know
- She's hunting violent radicals.
she's tracking these fanatics, the Watchdogs, trying to take down their funding, their ... their escape routes.
Regardless, you should fuel up and get back up in the air ASAP.
Find her before the military does something bad.
Or Daisy does something worse.
Hey.
You can't be here.
Stop right there.
How are we feeling today?
I've been tracking weapon sales, and I know you were hired to steal one.
You even jacked a big rig to help carry it out.
We were just paid for a smash-and-grab job.
Who was that hunting you?
Open the door!
He nailed me, but we almost got away.
Who was it?
- Did he kill my friends?
- All but one.
But you're gonna have to give me a little bit more if I'm gonna find him alive.
Save him, please, before he gets burned, too.
You'll see your buddy again once you heal up.
- Just tell me what's ...
- No.
No.
It's too late for me.
They say when the Rider burns you he burns your soul.
And a soul can never heal.
Stop right there!
Hello?
Hello?
I hear my voice echo, but it sounds strange in my head.
The detail is amazing.
However, I am 3 feet off the ground.
Wait.
What?
Hold on.
Damn it.
Uh, well, I did adjust the Y axis earlier for some reason.
- What does that look like now?
- Better.
The CPU seems to be handling the high poly count.
Textures are impeccable.
We should build a place to get away ... a meadow or a cottage somewhere.
I wish it were ever this quiet.
Direct-current stimulation.
Creates the other senses like touch and taste but also takes feedback.
So I've just mapped your brain's response ...
Response to the environment.
Of course.
Dr. Radcliffe came up with the architecture?
Yeah.
Yeah, he calls it "The Framework."
But all the transcranial apparatus, that's all me.
No.
Of course, you're brilliant, too.
Of course.
'Cause soon you won't even need the eyewear or the earwear, 'cause it'll all be inside your head.
So May's strike team will be able to train virtually instead of May constantly breaking their ribs.
Hey, hey.
Authorized personnel only, pal.
No pass, no entry.
- Who the hell are you?
- Leave them be, Nathanson.
They have more reason to be here than you do.
Wow.
A lot of new faces.
Good to see yours.
Six weeks.
That's a record.
- Heard you got a promotion.
- Oh, yeah, and a title.
Yeah, Special Advisor to the Director in Science and Technology.
Or "SADIST."
- They keeping you busy?
- With busywork, mostly.
Yeah, and random state-of-the-art lie-detector tests.
So that's the cost of being in the Director's inner circle.
Yeah, he's paranoid about what happened the last time S.H.I.E.L.D. was government-run.
Calls it his Widespread Infiltration Monitoring Program.
Or "WIMP." Hey, uh, you should join us 'cause we're gonna go to Radcliffe's and watch the
Aberdeen-Inverness Caley Thistle League cup final.
They're ...
Those are football teams.
I'm not sure they are, Turbo.
Unfortunately, we have to be wheels-up in 10 minutes, so...
Okay.
All right.
Well, strictly business, then.
Aw, yeah.
New toys?
The exploding pen that you asked for.
I can't imagine a use for it.
You never wanted one?
And for you, Direct... uh, Agent Coulson...
.. with new bells and whistles.
And the directions will be there when you boot it up.
What's, uh ...
What's the assignment?
- It's classified.
- Right.
Everything is these days.
- Fitz, sadly, um...
- Yeah, you can't make the match, either.
- I have to finish my reports.
- Yeah, no, I get it.
That's okay.
Just a shame we hardly get to see each other.
- Any of us.
- Yes, well...
At least it's better than the friends we'll never see again.
Trusted Teacher Killed.
Home Burned.
FOR HOUSEKEEPING
We just stole a box.
I don't even know what was inside of it.
We ...
We loaded it onto an 18-wheeler, we parked it in a warehouse, and we just left it.
Left it for who?
The Chinatown Crew.
They set the job up and were willing to pay big.
Lies.
Aryan Brotherhood working with the Chinese?
I swear!
I swear that's all I know.
Where's this warehouse?
I ...
I can't tell you that, man.
My people are gonna be mowed down in the payback ... the ones you didn't already kill.
If you don't tell me, you'll have to tell him.
This guy's missing.
The rest are dead.
Aryan Brotherhood.
They're not my kind of brothers.
They've been know to work for cash.
Burglary, assault ... sort of the value meal of hired guns.
They're suspected in the recent theft of this big rig.
- Probably prepping for a larger score.
- Big, yellow, hard to hide.
So, what, are we looking for this thing?
And if Daisy's chasing the same angle, maybe we get to the finish line first.
I'll greet her when she arrives.
- Agent Coulson?
- Davis.
Preparing for decent.
Inhuman asset will be waiting on the tarmac.
What?
- How's your wife, Davis?
- Getting bigger every day.
- Oh.
Don't tell her that.
- More beautiful every day.
There you go.
Mack.
Yo-Yo.
- Just have a few questions.
- I'm all yours.
Uh, so, I see you went to Colombia for a week.
Mm-hmm.
Mm.
And, uh, tickets to Miami coming up.
Yes.
Do you watch me sleep or shower or... ?
Just procedure.
You don't have to use a satellite to get to know me better.
Just ask me to dinner again.
You know the rules about fraternizing with assets in the field.
Oh, we haven't fraternized anything yet.
And I thought you were breaking the rules, coming to do my checkup early just to see me.
Or are you here because, uh, there's been a lot of little earthquakes lately?
Daisy could be in the area.
But officially, that's not the mission.
Doesn't matter.
We'll never find her.
She's always one step ahead.
What is the official mission?
Can I help?
Here's where I have to remind you that Sokovia Accords,
- which you signed...
- Oh, all right.
... require approval by the United Nations subcommittee...
- before an enhanced indiv...
- Rules, rules, rules.
Blah, blah, blah.
S.H.I.E.L.D. moves too slow now, Turtleman.
- I prefer to move fast.
- Uh...
Mack, they found the truck.
Good to see you, too, Coulson!
Well, if you're in Miami, look me up.
Just because we can't work together doesn't mean we can't live a little.
Hey, just in time.
They've just taken to the pitch.
Where's Jemma?
Is she not coming?
Yeah, she wanted to.
Same story.
All work and no play, huh?
That's a bit disappointing.
Still, make yourself comfortable.
I'm just, uh, finishing cleaning up.
Yeah, should be pretty lopsided, don't you think?
Their keeper's absolutely crap...
Oh, my gosh!
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I had no idea there was somebody here.
Hello.
You ...
You weren't meant to see that.
Hello.
I'm glad to final...
- Hello.
I'm glad to final...
- Fitz, meet Aida.
- Hello.
I'm glad to final...
- She's, uh, crashed.
Hello.
I'm glad to final...
Hello.
I'm glad to final...
Hello.
I'm glad to final...
Hello.
I'm glad to final...
Hello.
I'm glad to final...
Hello.
I'm glad to final...
- What the hell?
- Well, I've just upped her PSU to compensate for image processing.
Must have overcranked it.
I'll reboot.
Unh-unh, that's not what I meant.
I meant...
- ...what the hell?
!
- Well, you've already met Aida, digital personal assistant, as a voice on the computer.
So, uh...
- I built her a body.
- Yeah, a naked body.
I-I was just now installing new hardware, updating her gyroscopic sensors.
I'm not some sicko.
When did you build this?
Have you forgotten the very strict stipulations that came with your pardon?
You are not allowed experimentation
- without approval and oversight!
- Oversight, I know.
I'm well aware of that, yeah.
That's why I wanted Simmons here.
I wanted to show both of you.
Look.
This has been a lifelong dream of mine, Fitz.
When I saw the work you and Simmons were doing in replicating human tissue and internal bone structure in Coulson's hand, I knew ...
I knew right then that this was within reach.
- A robot?
- Not just a robot.
It's one that can cross the uncanny valley and come out the other side ...
pass for a human.
I mean, it has bloody micro-expressions.
She.
It's a ...
It's definitely a "she" 'cause I saw ...
- Yes...
- She has micro-expressions, full range of motion.
I mean, physically, it's ...
- she's nearly perfect.
- She is very realistic.
Now, mentally, well, you've spoken with Aida.
She's bright, she laughs at the jokes
I programmed her to recognize, but she's never pass the Turing test.
At the moment, that's a pipe dream.
However, I think, with your help...
No, no.
No, no, no, no!
We have to report this right away.
- You could lose everything.
- I know.
- Or you could go to jail.
- I know!
I know, you're right.
Full disclosure at this time is the best course of action.
I ...
I agree.
Hmm.
At least let me show you how it works.
They're in town.
I supposed you guessed that, texting me.
They're looking for a truck.
That mean you have something for me?
They watch my every move, but certain moves they can't see.
You can't get these over the counter.
S.H.I.E.L.D. issue for rapid bone healing, yes?
I know you splintered your bones when you first powered up.
- Are you pushing yourself too hard?
- Don't worry about me.
You can't use your powers too much.
- Your body will break down.
- I'm fine.
I'm surprised you're still in town.
You're usually moving and moving.
Are you, uh, still hunting those perros rabiosos?
It's not just the Watchdogs now.
Local gangs have been working for them, which I... don't understand.
I was tracing the sale of a weapon, and I...
I think I may have stumbled upon a serial killer.
Ooh.
Fun.
He live around here?
He mostly hits this area, but he's hard to track down, leaves no traces behind, operates alone.
Sound familiar?
I thought maybe you were, uh, growing roots, they say.
- L.A. used to be where you hang out, no?
- No roots.
Everyone gets attached to something eventually.
Don't forget to wait two stops after I get off.
Yeah, yeah.
Hey.
Send me a picture of this guy.
Maybe I can cover some ground if I know what he looks like.
No, I still haven't gotten a good look at him yet, so just...
take care of yourself, okay?
But thank you for the S.H.I.E.L.D. Intel.
They won't give up on you, especially Coulson.
All he wants is to find you.
Well, that's too bad, 'cause there's only one thing I want.
Oh, yeah?
What's that?
Nothing to lose.
Here's the Mapping-Action Eyewear you requested.
Should help your team in case of a blind takedown.
- Great.
Thanks.
- I need you to sign for it.
I don't get the new color-coded security-level rainbow of...
- What's it called?
- The "Spectrum of Security."
Why do I, level red, have to go through you, level orange, to request hardware?
Shouldn't red be higher than orange?
Well, orange encompasses both red and yellow, so...
It's hard to explain, but the Director didn't want to use numbers because he didn't want any team member to feel less than.
Well, you do have a higher clearance than me.
Only in most instances.
I feel less than.
Hey, we just had a report come in.
A death in a hospital in Los Angeles.
Suspicious circumstances.
Suspect is an Asian female.
You think it might be Daisy.
I'm going to look into it.
I just wondered if you'd heard anything from your law-enforcement contacts?
I'm mostly in the dark these days.
Why don't you ask the Director?
Since you're one of the few people allowed or willing to do that.
What you got there?
Didn't hear?
Word is, he hit again last night.
- Two dead in the street.
- Who?
Ghost Rider.
You must not be from around here.
Do you know where I can find him?
Nobody does.
Everybody that sees his face ends up on this wall.
"Everyone gets attached to something."
We got to get this truck out of here.
What are you, the Feds?
Something like that.
We'll be sealing the scene.
Not for long, I hope.
I was just gonna have this guy tow this thing away so me and my crew can get back to work.
We got this.
This warehouse usually sits empty.
We were gonna store some inventory today.
Found the lock broken and this big, honkin' thing inside.
- Have at it.
- Thank you.
Not fair.
You want tech like this, you should've cut off your own hand.
Mack.
Okay.
Looks like these guys tore each other apart.
Zhang Wei, resident of Monterey Park.
Organ donor.
Say anything about him being a flesh-hungry rage monster?
Uh, no, I'm not seeing anything about that here, so we have to assume that he wasn't until he came in contact with whatever's in that trailer.
Not much here that'll lead us anywhere.
Well... there's that.
There was no buyer there.
No, no, no.
No!
Please, God, no!
No!
I don't deserve to die!
- No!
No!
- Everyone says that.
No!
No!
No!
Yeah, those chargers are hard to find.
Between "Fast and Furious" and "Dukes of Hazzard,"
they wrecked a lot of them.
My boyfriend wrecked his in a street race.
He's pretty broken up.
I guess he was more attached to it than I thought.
I ain't seen none around here, though.
- Sorry.
- All right.
Thanks, man.
Hey, uh, most of them wrecked movie cars, they're dumped at El Monte Junk and Salvage.
If your boyfriend wants to fix his ride up, might want to go over there and find scraps.
Thanks.
Maybe he'll go there.
Daisy's in Los Angeles.
There was an eyewitness, now dead, and I just received Yo-Yo's check-in report a week early, which means Coulson and Mack are there, too,
- no doubt, trying to track Daisy down.
- Sounds right.
You know it is, because according to the logs, you called Coulson back to H.Q. for resupply yourself.
Why, if not to give him that intel in person, knowing it's against the Director's orders?
I didn't send them.
I don't have the authority.
- They acted on their own.
- You knew I'd find out.
Why not tell me?
I have daily lie detection.
- That's why.
- And now I have to report it, which means now I either look like I'm incompetent
- or colluding with you.
- Wouldn't want you falling out of favor with the director.
Okay.
I get it.
It's abundantly clear you're uncomfortable with my new position ...
I just want to know how comfortable you are with it.
You actually trust this guy?
Our team split up to lead departments, given different colors.
'Cause we're experts?
No.
I think the Director broke up the band on purpose.
Of course he did!
As soon as Talbot gave the location of this base to the president, things changed.
I knew we'd be divided, undermined, kept in the dark, so I have been clawing for as much power as I can possibly grab to keep a modicum of control over any of this.
After all we've been through...
I don't trust the new Director, but he trusts me, so now, in order to keep that trust,
I must take the appropriate action to address this break in protocol.
I'm sending you and your strike team to take Coulson and Mack out of the field, by force, if necessary.
Clean up whatever mess he's in.
- That's an order.
- Yes, ma'am.
Place them at the four corners of the exterior of the building.
That'll give us visuals through the walls.
This could be very dangerous.
- So much could go wrong.
- Ultron, yes.
I know.
But this is not A.I. A.I. is banned, and that's good.
This is mimicry of human behavior.
Still, in the wrong hands, this could be used as a weapon.
- Is that the idea?
- No, absolutely not.
No ...
Look, I know the dangers.
That's why I've been ...
I've been reticent to divulge.
I don't know these new people at S.H.I.E.L.D.
But a weapon is absolutely not the idea.
Well, then, why?
What's she for?
Why not let Aida tell you herself?
Hello.
I'm glad to finally shake your hand, Leopold.
Where's Jemma?
We were hoping that she would come.
S-She's, uh...
indisposed, I'm afraid.
Aida...
- I was wondering ...
- Yes, Agent Fitz?
I was wondering if you could tell me exactly what it is you are designed for.
Of course.
Dr. Radcliffe, time and again, has expressed his deep regret for causing pain when all he ever wanted was to prevent it.
He speaks often of the pain that you and Agent Simmons have had to suffer, having lost so many friends ...
Lincoln Campbell,
Andrew Garner, Antoine Triplett ...
Okay, stop it, stop.
You don't have to list them.
Sorry.
The hope is that I will be able to prevent future tragedies ... save the lives of agents by putting myself in harm's way in their place.
- To kill?
- No.
I am incapable of that.
I will protect.
I will serve as a decoy target, a safeguard... a shield.
- Okay.
T-Turn her off.
We can't tell Simmons about this.
What?
Don't we want to move forward?
Her approval is ...
This is too dangerous to show the new Director.
We don't know what he'd do with it.
And she would have to tell him, so... she can't know.
- Not until...
- Until... ?
Until she's perfect.
They're walking in now, six.
Really convivial-looking fellows.
At least four of them are packing.
We should be tapped into surveillance now.
Let's see what we get.
Where are the other two men?
We had to leave them at the pick-up site.
Explain.
Those guys were transferring the box into the armored transport.
Maybe they peeked inside or something.
But they went berserk and tore into each other.
There was blood everywhere.
We put two bullets in each of them and locked them in the truck.
No, no.
Look, we were freaking out.
We had to get out of there!
Did you burn their bodies or dump the truck in the ocean?
Because if not, they can be traced back here.
They probably saw what was in this box and were fighting over it, you idiot!
I have been told it's powerful enough to bring our new enhanced enemies to their knees.
We get on comms and call the Zephyr for backup, headquarters will know we're on Daisy's trail.
No orders to pull out.
She's been tracking this sale.
- She could show up here any minute.
- I don't know.
Let's let this play out, see if anyone else makes an appearance.
Excuse me.
Uh, the yard's closing.
To sell a junker, you can call the number on the gate.
Oh, no, I'm not here for that.
I, uh ...
Uh, sorry.
What's your name?
Robbie.
Well, Robbie, I am looking for a guy with a sweet black '69 Charger.
Maybe he bought some parts here.
Sorry.
Doesn't ring a bell.
I only work nights once a week.
Uh, well, maybe I'll ...
I'll come back in the morning.
Thank you.
Or...
there's a book of sales you can flip through in the main office.
Not really an office.
More of a trailer, but I can show you.
That would be great, thank you.
The hell... ?
What was that?
A breath of fresh air.
Get away from me!
That's it there.
- So, you live around here?
- No, I used to.
I'm just in town for a couple days, soaking up the sun.
Strange place to spend your vacation.
So... you've got the devil inside you, too.
What's going on, guys?
Call for backup, yeah?
We can't wait for Daisy.
These guys might kill somebody besides each other.
Yeah.
Us.
Z One, we got a situation.
We need a little help here.
That was efficient.
You guys know what to do.
Damn.
All clear.
You shouldn't have gotten involved.
Serial killers always complain when we try to intervene.
I only kill asesinos who deserve it.
It's vengeance, chica.
For what?
You killed a detective.
But he had blood on his hands.
- A teacher!
- A pedophile.
You don't get to decide who deserves to die.
I'm not the one who decides.
Do it.
I deserve it.
Do it.
Hey.
Thank for the ride, Janet.
You never accept rides.
Bus break down?
Or you still trying to holler at Janet's little sister?
Maybe.
I only needed a ride to help Canelo balance some books because my brother didn't finish high school.
Yo, I finished high school...
in the 11th grade.
"Everyone's attached to something."
- Spent a lot of time in here?
- Too much.
My wallet's starting to get sick of it.
Your little side mission didn't go unnoticed.
Well, you showed up, so, yeah.
The Director will want to have words with you at H.Q.
- No Daisy, huh?
- No.
But she was tracking these guys, so maybe this is a win.
I don't know.
The ground team is checking for contagion, but hopefully, whatever messed with these guys' heads is no longer an issue.
We're gonna analyze the box it came in.
It's good...
to have a moment, just us.
It's been a long time since we had a moment alone.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
Just a long day.
Well, take advantage of the down time.
Who knows what tomorrow holds?
Precisely Synchronized by srjanapala
It's coming!
Get ready!
Go, man, go!
Aah!
Damn it!
Damn it!
Engine's dead!
Get it.
Kill it!
Shoot anything that moves.
Help.
He...
He got me.
He'll kill us all.
Give me that damn thing.
Get back!
Shoot it!
Shoot it now!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No, please!
No!
4x01 - "The Ghost"
You need to sacrifice everything if you want to survive.
Hmm.
That's funny.
'Cause I thought I would just...
Mm.
Yeah, that's one way to go.
Want a beer?
It's 6:00 in the morning.
What, are you Hemingway?
No, is that real?
When did we cross the North Pole?
An hour ago.
Oh, my gosh.
It's hard to keep track in this thing.
We shouldn't have to stay on clock when we're moving through time zones.
I mean, what is that...
three continents in two days?
If you count Berlin.
We were only there three hours.
Yeah, we knew that Inhuman call was a hoax as soon as we stepped foot in the apartment, saw that bong.
- I could smell it from the hallway.
- Jokers.
Hungry for attention.
And potato chips.
If the munchies was a superpower, they'd be signing the Sokovia Accords as we speak.
You should let me work on Lola.
I warned you.
Everything in Lola is custom.
Yeah, yeah, everything is custom.
But it would be something to do.
There's only so many times a guy can win cash off you... sir.
You got to stop calling me that.
- We're being called back to H.Q.
- They say why?
We're not due for a restock for another 10 days.
- No idea.
They said it's classified.
- Oh, everything is nowadays.
All right, we'll need full inventory.
Medical, provisions, fuel cells, and make sure you tell the crew they'll need to call ahead if they want off our next deployment.
Agent Thompson...
- Wonder what that's about.
- Oh, I don't know.
- It'll be good to see Fitz and Simmons.
- And May.
Yeah...
I think you look forward to that more than I do.
Hyah!
What was his mistake?
You know I'm not gonna talk.
He didn't anticipate your back kick.
Opened himself up.
His mistake was he tapped out.
- Piper.
- Okay, people!
What, you never seen the biggest plane ever built before?
!
Next pairing, on the mat!
- How long has it been?
- Six weeks in the air.
Only the Quinjet touched down.
- Is that a record for Zephyr One?
- It is.
It was supposed to be even longer.
- You know who called us in?
- I do.
You?
Okay.
Now I know something's up.
I got word from contacts in law enforcement, Los Angeles.
Two civilians were violently killed.
Mysterious burns, heads bashed in, spine pulled out of his...
Wow.
Many conflicting accounts, but all agree... it was odd.
Odd?
Isn't that our wheelhouse?
He's right.
Why call us in?
We could be headed to the scene right now to confirm the presence of an enhanced person,
- if there is one.
- If it checks out, we bag and tag.
We handle these on the fly.
Didn't exactly want to send this out on the wire.
May, you're not sharing again.
Now would be a really good time to share.
The police also have another victim in custody.
Critical condition.
Under sedation, he mentioned seeing a girl, saying it was the one from the news.
Quake.
Which you didn't want to send over the wire.
You were pulled off Daisy's case.
The Director thinks she slipped through our fingers too many times.
The Director thinks you let her.
No, we pursued her.
She was a ghost.
Well, in his infinite wisdom, he says you're now forbidden to.
But you're telling us this because...?
In case we want to do something about it.
Look, I can bury this until the official police report comes through.
That'll buy us a few hours lead time.
Get to L.A., sniff around.
Yeah.
We have an active Inhuman asset in Los Angeles that's due for a check-in soon enough.
It'll justify our presence there, but as soon as the report's filed, they'll pull us out.
And the armed forces will be sent in after her.
With orders to kill.
- To kill?
- If she's responsible for these bodies.
- That's not Daisy's M.O.
- The world knows her as Quake, and Quake is an outlaw who takes down banks and bridges.
- Oh, come on.
We both know
- She's hunting violent radicals.
She's tracking these fanatics, the Watchdogs, trying to take down their funding, their... their escape routes.
Regardless, you should fuel up and get back up in the air ASAP.
Find her before the military does something bad.
Or Daisy does something worse.
Hey.
You can't be here.
Stop right there.
How are we feeling today?
I've been tracking weapon sales, and I know you were hired to steal one.
You even jacked a big rig to help carry it out.
We were just paid for a smash-and-grab job.
Who was that hunting you?
Open the door!
He nailed me, but we almost got away.
Who was it?
- Did he kill my friends?
- All but one.
But you're gonna have to give me a little bit more if I'm gonna find him alive.
Save him, please, before he gets burned, too.
You'll see your buddy again once you heal up.
- Just tell me what's...
- No.
No.
It's too late for me.
They say when the Rider burns you he burns your soul.
And a soul can never heal.
Stop right there!
Hello?
Hello?
I hear my voice echo, but it sounds strange in my head.
The detail is amazing.
However, I am 3 feet off the ground.
Wait.
What?
Hold on.
Damn it.
Uh, well, I did adjust the Y axis earlier for some reason.
- What does that look like now?
- Better.
The CPU seems to be handling the high poly count.
Textures are impeccable.
We should build a place to get away... a meadow or a cottage somewhere.
I wish it were ever this quiet.
Direct-current stimulation.
Creates the other senses like touch and taste but also takes feedback.
So I've just mapped your brain's response...
Response to the environment.
Of course.
Dr. Radcliffe came up with the architecture?
Yeah.
Yeah, he calls it "The Framework."
But all the transcranial apparatus, that's all me.
No.
Of course, you're brilliant, too.
Of course.
'Cause soon you won't even need the eyewear or the earwear, 'cause it'll all be inside your head.
So May's strike team will be able to train virtually instead of May constantly breaking their ribs.
Hey, hey.
Authorized personnel only, pal.
No pass, no entry.
- Who the hell are you?
- Leave them be, Nathanson.
They have more reason to be here than you do.
Wow.
A lot of new faces.
Good to see yours.
Six weeks.
That's a record.
- Heard you got a promotion.
- Oh, yeah, and a title.
Yeah, Special Advisor to the Director in Science and Technology.
Or "SADIST."
- They keeping you busy?
- With busywork, mostly.
Yeah, and random state-of-the-art lie-detector tests.
So that's the cost of being in the Director's inner circle.
Yeah, he's paranoid about what happened the last time S.H.I.E.L.D. was government-run.
Calls it his Widespread Infiltration Monitoring Program.
Or "WIMP." Hey, uh, you should join us 'cause we're gonna go to Radcliffe's and watch the
Aberdeen-Inverness Caley Thistle League cup final.
They're...
Those are football teams.
I'm not sure they are, Turbo.
Unfortunately, we have to be wheels-up in 10 minutes, so...
Okay.
All right.
Well, strictly business, then.
Aw, yeah.
New toys?
The exploding pen that you asked for.
I can't imagine a use for it.
You never wanted one?
And for you, Direct... uh, Agent Coulson with new bells and whistles.
And the directions will be there when you boot it up.
What's, uh...
What's the assignment?
- It's classified.
- Right.
Everything is these days.
- Fitz, sadly, um...
- Yeah, you can't make the match, either.
- I have to finish my reports.
- Yeah, no, I get it.
That's okay.
Just a shame we hardly get to see each other.
- Any of us.
- Yes, well...
At least it's better than the friends we'll never see again.
_
_
We just stole a box.
I don't even know what was inside of it.
We...
We loaded it onto an 18-wheeler, we parked it in a warehouse, and we just left it.
Left it for who?
The Chinatown Crew.
They set the job up and were willing to pay big.
Lies.
Aryan Brotherhood working with the Chinese?
I swear!
I swear that's all I know.
Where's this warehouse?
I...
I can't tell you that, man.
My people are gonna be mowed down in the payback... the ones you didn't already kill.
If you don't tell me, you'll have to tell him.
This guy's missing.
The rest are dead.
Aryan Brotherhood.
They're not my kind of brothers.
They've been know to work for cash.
Burglary, assault... sort of the value meal of hired guns.
They're suspected in the recent theft of this big rig.
- Probably prepping for a larger score.
- Big, yellow, hard to hide.
So, what, are we looking for this thing?
And if Daisy's chasing the same angle, maybe we get to the finish line first.
I'll greet her when she arrives.
- Agent Coulson?
- Davis.
Preparing for decent.
Inhuman asset will be waiting on the tarmac.
What?
- How's your wife, Davis?
- Getting bigger every day.
- Oh.
Don't tell her that.
- More beautiful every day.
There you go.
Mack.
Yo-Yo.
- Just have a few questions.
- I'm all yours.
Uh, so, I see you went to Colombia for a week.
Mm-hmm.
Mm.
And, uh, tickets to Miami coming up.
Yes.
Do you watch me sleep or shower or...?
Just procedure.
You don't have to use a satellite to get to know me better.
Just ask me to dinner again.
You know the rules about fraternizing with assets in the field.
Oh, we haven't fraternized anything yet.
And I thought you were breaking the rules, coming to do my checkup early just to see me.
Or are you here because, uh, there's been a lot of little earthquakes lately?
Daisy could be in the area.
But officially, that's not the mission.
Doesn't matter.
We'll never find her.
She's always one step ahead.
What is the official mission?
Can I help?
Here's where I have to remind you that Sokovia Accords,
- which you signed...
- Oh, all right.
...require approval by the United Nations subcommittee...
- before an enhanced indiv...
- Rules, rules, rules.
Blah, blah, blah.
S.H.I.E.L.D. moves too slow now, Turtleman.
- I prefer to move fast.
- Uh...
Mack, they found the truck.
Good to see you, too, Coulson!
Well, if you're in Miami, look me up.
Just because we can't work together doesn't mean we can't live a little.
Hey, just in time.
They've just taken to the pitch.
Where's Jemma?
Is she not coming?
Yeah, she wanted to.
Same story.
All work and no play, huh?
That's a bit disappointing.
Still, make yourself comfortable.
I'm just, uh, finishing cleaning up.
Yeah, should be pretty lopsided, don't you think?
Their keeper's absolutely crap...
Oh, my gosh!
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I had no idea there was somebody here.
Hello.
You...
You weren't meant to see that.
Hello.
I'm glad to final...
- Hello.
I'm glad to final...
- Fitz, meet Aida.
- Hello.
I'm glad to final...
- She's, uh, crashed.
Hello.
I'm glad to final...
Hello.
I'm glad to final...
Hello.
I'm glad to final...
Hello.
I'm glad to final...
Hello.
I'm glad to final...
Hello.
I'm glad to final...
- What the hell?
- Well, I've just upped her PSU to compensate for image processing.
Must have overcranked it.
I'll reboot.
Unh-unh, that's not what I meant.
I meant...
- ...what the hell?
!
- Well, you've already met Aida, digital personal assistant, as a voice on the computer.
So, uh...
- I built her a body.
- Yeah, a naked body.
I-I was just now installing new hardware, updating her gyroscopic sensors.
I'm not some sicko.
When did you build this?
Have you forgotten the very strict stipulations that came with your pardon?
You are not allowed experimentation
- without approval and oversight!
- Oversight, I know.
I'm well aware of that, yeah.
That's why I wanted Simmons here.
I wanted to show both of you.
Look.
This has been a lifelong dream of mine, Fitz.
When I saw the work you and Simmons were doing in replicating human tissue and internal bone structure in Coulson's hand, I knew...
I knew right then that this was within reach.
- A robot?
- Not just a robot.
It's one that can cross the uncanny valley and come out the other side...
pass for a human.
I mean, it has bloody micro-expressions.
She.
It's a...
It's definitely a "she" 'cause I saw...
- Yes...
- She has micro-expressions, full range of motion.
I mean, physically, it's...
- she's nearly perfect.
- She is very realistic.
Now, mentally, well, you've spoken with Aida.
She's bright, she laughs at the jokes
I programmed her to recognize, but she's never pass the Turing test.
At the moment, that's a pipe dream.
However, I think, with your help...
No, no.
No, no, no, no!
We have to report this right away.
- You could lose everything.
- I know.
- Or you could go to jail.
- I know!
I know, you're right.
Full disclosure at this time is the best course of action.
I...
I agree.
Hmm.
At least let me show you how it works.
They're in town.
I supposed you guessed that, texting me.
They're looking for a truck.
That mean you have something for me?
They watch my every move, but certain moves they can't see.
You can't get these over the counter.
S.H.I.E.L.D. issue for rapid bone healing, yes?
I know you splintered your bones when you first powered up.
- Are you pushing yourself too hard?
- Don't worry about me.
You can't use your powers too much.
- Your body will break down.
- I'm fine.
I'm surprised you're still in town.
You're usually moving and moving.
Are you, uh, still hunting those perros rabiosos?
It's not just the Watchdogs now.
Local gangs have been working for them, which I... don't understand.
I was tracing the sale of a weapon, and I...
I think I may have stumbled upon a serial killer.
Ooh.
Fun.
He live around here?
He mostly hits this area, but he's hard to track down, leaves no traces behind, operates alone.
Sound familiar?
I thought maybe you were, uh, growing roots, they say.
- L.A. used to be where you hang out, no?
- No roots.
Everyone gets attached to something eventually.
Don't forget to wait two stops after I get off.
Yeah, yeah.
Hey.
Send me a picture of this guy.
Maybe I can cover some ground if I know what he looks like.
No, I still haven't gotten a good look at him yet, so just...
take care of yourself, okay?
But thank you for the S.H.I.E.L.D. intel.
They won't give up on you, especially Coulson.
All he wants is to find you.
Well, that's too bad, 'cause there's only one thing I want.
Oh, yeah?
What's that?
Nothing to lose.
Here's the Mapping-Action Eyewear you requested.
Should help your team in case of a blind takedown.
- Great.
Thanks.
- I need you to sign for it.
I don't get the new color-coded security-level rainbow of...
- What's it called?
- The "Spectrum of Security."
Why do I, level red, have to go through you, level orange, to request hardware?
Shouldn't red be higher than orange?
Well, orange encompasses both red and yellow, so...
It's hard to explain, but the Director didn't want to use numbers because he didn't want any team member to feel less than.
Well, you do have a higher clearance than me.
Only in most instances.
I feel less than.
Hey, we just had a report come in.
A death in a hospital in Los Angeles.
Suspicious circumstances.
Suspect is an Asian female.
You think it might be Daisy.
I'm going to look into it.
I just wondered if you'd heard anything from your law-enforcement contacts?
I'm mostly in the dark these days.
Why don't you ask the Director?
Since you're one of the few people allowed or willing to do that.
What you got there?
Didn't hear?
Word is, he hit again last night.
- Two dead in the street.
- Who?
Ghost Rider.
You must not be from around here.
Do you know where I can find him?
Nobody does.
Everybody that sees his face ends up on this wall.
"Everyone gets attached to something."
We got to get this truck out of here.
What are you, the Feds?
Something like that.
We'll be sealing the scene.
Not for long, I hope.
I was just gonna have this guy tow this thing away so me and my crew can get back to work.
We got this.
This warehouse usually sits empty.
We were gonna store some inventory today.
Found the lock broken and this big, honkin' thing inside.
- Have at it.
- Thank you.
Not fair.
You want tech like this, you should've cut off your own hand.
Mack.
Okay.
Looks like these guys tore each other apart.
Zhang Wei, resident of Monterey Park.
Organ donor.
Say anything about him being a flesh-hungry rage monster?
Uh, no, I'm not seeing anything about that here, so we have to assume that he wasn't until he came in contact with whatever's in that trailer.
Not much here that'll lead us anywhere.
Well... there's that.
There was no buyer there.
No, no, no.
No!
Please, God, no!
No!
I don't deserve to die!
- No!
No!
- Everyone says that.
No!
No!
No!
Yeah, those chargers are hard to find.
Between "Fast and Furious" and "Dukes of Hazzard,"
they wrecked a lot of them.
My boyfriend wrecked his in a street race.
He's pretty broken up.
I guess he was more attached to it than I thought.
I ain't seen none around here, though.
- Sorry.
- All right.
Thanks, man.
Hey, uh, most of them wrecked movie cars, they're dumped at El Monte Junk and Salvage.
If your boyfriend wants to fix his ride up, might want to go over there and find scraps.
Thanks.
Maybe he'll go there.
Daisy's in Los Angeles.
There was an eyewitness, now dead, and I just received Yo-Yo's check-in report a week early, which means Coulson and Mack are there, too,
- no doubt, trying to track Daisy down.
- Sounds right.
You know it is, because according to the logs, you called Coulson back to H.Q. for resupply yourself.
Why, if not to give him that intel in person, knowing it's against the Director's orders?
I didn't send them.
I don't have the authority.
- They acted on their own.
- You knew I'd find out.
Why not tell me?
I have daily lie detection.
- That's why.
- And now I have to report it, which means now I either look like I'm incompetent
- or colluding with you.
- Wouldn't want you falling out of favor with the director.
Okay.
I get it.
It's abundantly clear you're uncomfortable with my new position...
I just want to know how comfortable you are with it.
You actually trust this guy?
Our team split up to lead departments, given different colors.
'Cause we're experts?
No.
I think the Director broke up the band on purpose.
Of course he did!
As soon as Talbot gave the location of this base to the president, things changed.
I knew we'd be divided, undermined, kept in the dark, so I have been clawing for as much power as I can possibly grab to keep a modicum of control over any of this.
After all we've been through...
I don't trust the new Director, but he trusts me, so now, in order to keep that trust,
I must take the appropriate action to address this break in protocol.
I'm sending you and your strike team to take Coulson and Mack out of the field, by force, if necessary.
Clean up whatever mess he's in.
- That's an order.
- Yes, ma'am.
Place them at the four corners of the exterior of the building.
That'll give us visuals through the walls.
This could be very dangerous.
- So much could go wrong.
- Ultron, yes.
I know.
But this is not A.I. A.I. is banned, and that's good.
This is mimicry of human behavior.
Still, in the wrong hands, this could be used as a weapon.
- Is that the idea?
- No, absolutely not.
No...
Look, I know the dangers.
That's why I've been...
I've been reticent to divulge.
I don't know these new people at S.H.I.E.L.D.
But a weapon is absolutely not the idea.
Well, then, why?
What's she for?
Why not let Aida tell you herself?
Hello.
I'm glad to finally shake your hand, Leopold.
Where's Jemma?
We were hoping that she would come.
S-She's, uh...
indisposed, I'm afraid.
Aida...
- I was wondering...
- Yes, Agent Fitz?
I was wondering if you could tell me exactly what it is you are designed for.
Of course.
Dr. Radcliffe, time and again, has expressed his deep regret for causing pain when all he ever wanted was to prevent it.
He speaks often of the pain that you and Agent Simmons have had to suffer, having lost so many friends...
Lincoln Campbell,
Andrew Garner, Antoine Triplett...
Okay, stop it, stop.
You don't have to list them.
Sorry.
The hope is that I will be able to prevent future tragedies... save the lives of agents by putting myself in harm's way in their place.
- To kill?
- No.
I am incapable of that.
I will protect.
I will serve as a decoy target, a safeguard...
- ...a shield.
- Okay.
T-Turn her off.
We can't tell Simmons about this.
What?
Don't we want to move forward?
Her approval is...
This is too dangerous to show the new Director.
We don't know what he'd do with it.
And she would have to tell him, so... she can't know.
- Not until...
- Until...?
Until she's perfect.
They're walking in now, six.
Really convivial-looking fellows.
At least four of them are packing.
We should be tapped into surveillance now.
Let's see what we get.
Where are the other two men?
We had to leave them at the pick-up site.
Explain.
Those guys were transferring the box into the armored transport.
Maybe they peeked inside or something.
But they went berserk and tore into each other.
There was blood everywhere.
We put two bullets in each of them and locked them in the truck.
No, no.
Look, we were freaking out.
We had to get out of there!
Did you burn their bodies or dump the truck in the ocean?
Because if not, they can be traced back here.
They probably saw what was in this box and were fighting over it, you idiot!
I have been told it's powerful enough to bring our new enhanced enemies to their knees.
We get on comms and call the Zephyr for backup, headquarters will know we're on Daisy's trail.
No orders to pull out.
She's been tracking this sale.
- She could show up here any minute.
- I don't know.
Let's let this play out, see if anyone else makes an appearance.
Excuse me.
Uh, the yard's closing.
To sell a junker, you can call the number on the gate.
Oh, no, I'm not here for that.
I, uh...
Uh, sorry.
What's your name?
Robbie.
Well, Robbie, I am looking for a guy with a sweet black '69 Charger.
Maybe he bought some parts here.
Sorry.
Doesn't ring a bell.
I only work nights once a week.
Uh, well, maybe I'll...
I'll come back in the morning.
Thank you.
Or...
there's a book of sales you can flip through in the main office.
Not really an office.
More of a trailer, but I can show you.
That would be great, thank you.
The hell...?
What was that?
A breath of fresh air.
Get away from me!
That's it there.
- So, you live around here?
- No, I used to.
I'm just in town for a couple days, soaking up the sun.
Strange place to spend your vacation.
Not a great neighborhood.
So... you've got the devil inside you, too.
What's going on, guys?
Call for backup, yeah?
We can't wait for Daisy.
These guys might kill somebody besides each other.
Yeah.
Us.
Z One, we got a situation.
We need a little help here.
That was efficient.
You guys know what to do.
Damn.
All clear.
You shouldn't have gotten involved.
Serial killers always complain when we try to intervene.
I only kill asesinos who deserve it.
It's vengeance, chica.
For what?
You killed a detective.
But he had blood on his hands.
- A teacher!
- A pedophile.
You don't get to decide who deserves to die.
I'm not the one who decides.
Do it.
I deserve it.
Do it.
Hey.
Thank for the ride, Janet.
You never accept rides.
Bus break down?
Or you still trying to holler at Janet's little sister?
Maybe.
I only needed a ride to help Canelo balance some books because my brother didn't finish high school.
Yo, I finished high school...
in the 11th grade.
"Everyone's attached to something."
- Spent a lot of time in here?
- Too much.
My wallet's starting to get sick of it.
Your little side mission didn't go unnoticed.
Well, you showed up, so, yeah.
The Director will want to have words with you at H.Q.
- No Daisy, huh?
- No.
But she was tracking these guys, so maybe this is a win.
I don't know.
The ground team is checking for contagion, but hopefully, whatever messed with these guys' heads is no longer an issue.
We're gonna analyze the box it came in.
It's good...
to have a moment, just us.
It's been a long time since we had a moment alone.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
Just a long day.
Well, take advantage of the down time.
Who knows what tomorrow holds?
It's coming!
Get ready!
Go, man, go!
Get it.
Kill it!
Shoot anything that moves.
Help.
He -- he got me.
He'll kill us all.
Give me that damn thing.
Get back!
Shoot it!
Shoot it now!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No, please!
No!
You need to sacrifice everything if you want to survive.
That's funny. 'Cause I thought I would just...
Yeah, that's one way to go.
Want a beer?
It's 6:00 in the morning.
What, are you Hemingway?
No, is that real?
When did we cross the North Pole?
An hour ago.
Oh, my gosh.
It's hard to keep track in this thing.
We shouldn't have to stay on clock when we're moving through time zones.
I mean, what is that -- three continents in two days?
If you count Berlin.
We were only there three hours.
Yeah, we knew that Inhuman call was a hoax as soon as we stepped foot in the apartment, saw that bong.
I could smell it from the hallway.
Jokers.
Hungry for attention.
And potato chips.
If the munchies was a superpower, they'd be signing the Sokovia Accords as we speak.
You should let me work on Lola.
I warned you.
Everything in Lola is custom.
Yeah, yeah, everything is custom.
But it would be something to do.
There's only so many times a guy can win cash off you...sir.
You got to stop calling me that.
We're being called back to H.Q.
They say why?
We're not due for a restock for another 10 days.
No idea.
They said it's classified.
Oh, everything is nowadays.
All right, we'll need full inventory.
Medical, provisions, fuel cells, and make sure you tell the crew they'll need to call ahead if they want off our next deployment.
Agent Thompson...
Wonder what that's about.
Oh, I don't know.
It'll be good to see Fitz and Simmons.
- And May.
- Mm.
I think you look forward to that more than I do.
What was his mistake?
You know I'm not gonna talk.
He didn't anticipate your back kick.
Opened himself up.
His mistake was he tapped out.
Piper.
Okay, people!
What, you never seen the biggest plane ever built before?
!
Next pairing, on the mat!
How long has it been?
Six weeks in the air.
Only the Quinjet touched down.
Is that a record for Zephyr One?
It is.
It was supposed to be even longer.
You know who called us in?
I do.
You?
Okay.
Now I know something's up.
I got word from contacts in law enforcement, Los Angeles.
Two civilians were violently killed.
Mysterious burns, heads bashed in, spine pulled out of his -- .
Many conflicting accounts, but all agree...it was odd.
Odd?
Isn't that our wheelhouse?
He's right.
Why call us in?
We could be headed to the scene right now to confirm the presence of an enhanced person, if there is one.
If it checks out, we bag and tag.
We handle these on the fly.
Didn't exactly want to send this out on the wire.
May, you're not sharing again.
Now would be a really good time to share.
The police also have another victim in custody.
Critical condition.
Under sedation, he mentioned seeing a girl, saying it was the one from the news.
Quake.
Which you didn't want to send over the wire.
You were pulled off Daisy's case.
The Director thinks she slipped through our fingers too many times.
The Director thinks you let her.
No, we pursued her.
She was a ghost.
Well, in his infinite wisdom, he says you're now forbidden to.
But you're telling us this because...?
In case we want to do something about it.
Look, I can bury this until the official police report comes through.
That'll buy us a few hours lead time.
Get to L.A., sniff around.
Yeah.
We have an active Inhuman asset in Los Angeles that's due for a check-in soon enough.
It'll justify our presence there, but as soon as the report's filed, they'll pull us out.
And the armed forces will be sent in after her.
With orders to kill.
To kill?
If she's responsible for these bodies.
That's not Daisy's M.O.
The world knows her as Quake, and Quake is an outlaw who takes down banks and bridges.
Oh, come on.
She's hunting violent radicals.
We both know she's tracking these fanatics, the Watchdogs, trying to take down their funding, their -- their escape routes.
Regardless, you should fuel up and get back up in the air ASAP.
Find her before the military does something bad.
Or Daisy does something worse.
Stop right there.
How are we feeling today?
I've been tracking weapon sales, and I know you were hired to steal one.
You even jacked a big rig to help carry it out.
We were just paid for a smash-and-grab job.
Who was that hunting you?
He nailed me, but we almost got away.
Who was it?
Did he kill my friends?
All but one.
But you're gonna have to give me a little bit more if I'm gonna find him alive.
Save him, please, before he gets burned, too.
You'll see your buddy again once you heal up.
Just tell me what's --
No.
It's too late for me.
They say when the Rider burns you he burns your soul.
And a soul can never heal.
Stop right there!
Hello?
Hello?
I hear my voice echo, but it sounds strange in my head.
The detail is amazing.
However, I am 3 feet off the ground.
Wait.
What?
Hold on.
Damn it.
Uh, well, I did adjust the Y axis earlier for some reason.
What does that look like now?
Better.
The CPU seems to be handling the high poly count.
Textures are impeccable.
We should build a place to get away -- a meadow or a cottage somewhere.
I wish it were ever this quiet.
Direct-current stimulation.
Creates the other senses like touch and taste but also takes feedback.
So I've just mapped your brain's response --
Response to the environment.
Of course.
Dr. Radcliffe came up with the architecture?
Yeah.
Yeah, he calls it "The Framework."
But all the transcranial apparatus, that's all me.
No.
Of course, you're brilliant, too.
Of course.
'Cause soon you won't even need the eyewear or the earwear, 'cause it'll all be inside your head.
So May's strike team will be able to train virtually instead of May constantly breaking their ribs.
Authorized personnel only, pal.
No pass, no entry.
Who the hell are you?
Leave them be, Nathanson.
They have more reason to be here than you do.
A lot of new faces.
Good to see yours.
Six weeks.
That's a record.
Heard you got a promotion.
Oh, yeah, and a title.
Yeah, Special Advisor to the Director in Science and Technology.
Or "SADIST."
They keeping you busy?
With busywork, mostly.
Yeah, and random state-of-the-art lie-detector tests.
So that's the cost of being in the Director's inner circle.
Yeah, he's paranoid about what happened the last time S.H.I.E.L.D. was government-run.
Calls it his Widespread Infiltration Monitoring Program.
Or "WIMP."
Hey, uh, you should join us 'cause we're gonna go to Radcliffe's and watch the Aberdeen-Inverness Caley Thistle League cup final.
They're -
- Those are football teams.
I'm not sure they are, Turbo.
Unfortunately, we have to be wheels-up in 10 minutes, so...
Okay.
All right.
Well, strictly business, then.
Aw, yeah.
New toys?
The exploding pen that you asked for.
I can't imagine a use for it.
You never wanted one?
And for you, Direct--
Uh, Agent Coulson with new bells and whistles.
And the directions will be there when you boot it up.
What's, uh -
- What's the assignment?
It's classified.
Right.
Everything is these days.
Fitz, sadly, um...
Yeah, you can't make the match, either.
I have to finish my reports.
Yeah, no, I get it.
That's okay.
Just a shame we hardly get to see each other.
Any of us.
Yes, well...
At least it's better than the friends we'll never see again.
We just stole a box.
I don't even know what was inside of it.
We -- we loaded it onto an 18-wheeler, we parked it in a warehouse, and we just left it.
Left it for who?
The Chinatown Crew.
They set the job up and were willing to pay big.
Lies.
Aryan Brotherhood working with the Chinese?
I swear!
I swear that's all I know.
Where's this warehouse?
I...
I can't tell you that, man.
My people are gonna be mowed down in the payback... the ones you didn't already kill.
You don't tell me, you'll have to tell him.
This guy's missing.
The rest are dead.
Aryan Brotherhood.
They're not my kind of brothers.
They've been know to work for cash.
Burglary, assault, sort of the value meal of hired guns.
They're suspected in the recent theft of this big rig.
Probably prepping for a larger score.
Big, yellow, hard to hide.
So, what, are we looking for this thing?
And if Daisy's chasing the same angle, maybe we get to the finish line first.
I'll greet her when she arrives.
- Agent Coulson?
- Davis.
Preparing for decent.
Inhuman asset will be waiting on the tarmac.
What?
How's your wife, Davis?
Getting bigger every day.
Don't tell her that.
More beautiful every day.
There you go.
Mack.
Yo-Yo.
Just have a few questions.
I'm all yours.
Uh, so, I see you went to Colombia for a week.
And, uh, tickets to Miami coming up.
Yes.
Do you watch me sleep or shower or...?
Just procedure.
You don't have to use a satellite to get to know me better.
Just ask me to dinner again.
You know the rules about fraternizing with assets in the field.
Oh, we haven't fraternized anything yet.
And I thought you were breaking the rules, coming to do my checkup early just to see me.
Or are you here because, uh, there's been a lot of little earthquakes lately?
Daisy could be in the area.
But officially, that's not the mission.
Doesn't matter.
We'll never find her.
She's always one step ahead.
What is the official mission?
Can I help?
Here's where I have to remind you that Sokovia Accords,
- which you signed...
- Oh, all right.
...require approval by the United Nations
- subcommitteen before an enhanced indiv--
- Rules, rules, rules.
Blah, blah, blah.
S.H.I.E.L.D. moves too slow now, Turtleman.
I prefer to move fast.
Mack, they found the truck.
Good to see you, too, Coulson!
Well, if you're in Miami, look me up.
Just because we can't work together doesn't mean we can't live a little.
Hey, just in time.
They've just taken to the pitch.
Where's Jemma?
Is she not coming?
Yeah, she wanted to.
Same story.
All work and no play, huh?
That's a bit disappointing.
Still, make yourself comfortable.
I'm just, uh, finishing cleaning up.
Yeah, should be pretty lopsided, don't you think?
Their keeper's absolutely crap!
Oh, my gosh!
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I had no idea there was somebody here.
Hello.
You -
- You weren't meant to see that.
Hello.
I'm glad to final--
Hello.
I'm glad to final--
Fitz, meet Aida.
Hello.
I'm glad to final--
- She's, uh, crashed.
- Hello.
I'm glad to final--
Hello.
I'm glad to final--
Hello.
I'm glad to final--
Hello.
I'm glad to final--
Hello.
I'm glad to final--
Hello.
I'm glad to final--
What the hell?
Well, I've just upped her PSU to compensate for image processing.
Must have overcranked it.
I'll reboot.
That's not what I meant.
I meant...
What the hell?
!
Well, you've already met Aida, digital personal assistant, as a voice on the computer.
So, uh...
I built her a body.
Yeah, a naked body.
I was just now installing new hardware, updating her gyroscopic sensors.
I'm not some sicko.
When did you build this?
Have you forgotten the very strict stipulations that came with your pardon?
You are not allowed experimentation
- without approval and oversight!
- Oversight, I know.
I'm well aware of that, yeah.
That's why I wanted Simmons here.
I wanted to show both of you.
This has been a lifelong dream of mine, Fitz.
When I saw the work you and Simmons were doing in replicating human tissue and internal bone structure in Coulson's hand, I knew --
I knew right then - that this was within reach.
A robot?
Not just a robot.
It's one that can cross the uncanny valley and come out the other side -- pass for a human.
- I mean, it has bloody micro-expressions.
- She.
It's a -
- It's definitely a "She" 'cause I saw --
She has micro-expressions, full range of motion.
I mean, physically, it's -- she's nearly perfect.
She is... very realistic.
Now, mentally, well, you've spoken with Aida.
She's bright, she laughs at the jokes
I programmed her to recognize, but she's never pass the Turing test.
At the moment, that's a pipe dream.
However, I think, with your help...
No, no.
No, no, no, no!
We have to report this right away.
You could lose everything.
I know....
- Or you could go to jail.
- I know!
I know, you're right.
Full disclosure at this time is the best course of action.
I -
- I agree.
At least let me show you how it works.
They're in town.
I supposed you guessed that, texting me.
They're looking for a truck.
That mean you have something for me?
They watch my every move, but certain moves they can't see.
You can't get these over the counter.
S.H.I.E.L.D. issue for rapid bone healing, yes?
I know you splintered your bones when you first powered up.
Are you pushing yourself too hard?
Don't worry about me.
You can't use your powers too much.
Your body will break down.
I'm fine.
I'm surprised you're still in town.
You're usually moving and moving.
Are you, uh, still hunting those perros rabiosos?
It's not just the Watchdogs now.
Local gangs have been working for them, which I... don't understand.
I was tracing the sale of a weapon, and I...
I think I may have stumbled upon a serial killer.
Fun.
He live around here?
He mostly hits this area, but he's hard to track down, leaves no traces behind, operates alone.
Sound familiar?
I thought maybe you were, uh, growing roots, they say.
L.A. used to be where you hang out, no?
No roots.
Everyone gets attached to something eventually.
Don't forget to wait two stops after I get off.
Yeah, yeah.
Hey.
Send me a picture of this guy.
Maybe I can cover some ground if I know what he looks like.
No, I still haven't gotten a good look at him yet, so just... take care of yourself, okay?
But thank you for the S.H.I.E.L.D. intel.
They won't give up on you, especially Coulson.
All he wants is to find you.
Well, that's too bad, 'cause there's only one thing I want.
Oh, yeah?
What's that?
Nothing to lose.
Here's the Mapping-Action Eyewear you requested.
Should help your team in case of a blind takedown.
Great.
Thanks.
I need you to sign for it.
I don't get the new color-coded security-level rainbow of...
- What's it called?
- The "Spectrum of Security."
Why do I, level red, have to go through you, level orange, to request hardware?
Shouldn't red be higher than orange?
Well, orange encompasses both red and yellow, so...
It's hard to explain, but the Director didn't want to use numbers because he didn't want any team member to feel less than.
Well, you do have a higher clearance than me.
Only in most instances.
I feel less than.
Hey, we just had a report come in.
A death in a hospital in Los Angeles.
Suspicious circumstances.
Suspect is an Asian female.
You think it might be Daisy.
I'm going to look into it.
I just wondered if you'd heard anything from your law-enforcement contacts?
I'm mostly in the dark these days.
Why don't you ask the Director?
Since you're one of the few people allowed or willing to do that.
What you got there?
Didn't hear?
Word is, he hit again last night.
Two dead in the street.
Who?
Ghost Rider.
You must not be from around here.
Do you know where I can find him?
Nobody does.
Everybody that sees his face ends up on this wall.
Everyone gets attached to something.
We got to get this truck out of here.
What are you, the feds?
Something like that.
We'll be sealing the scene.
Not for long, I hope.
I was just gonna have this guy tow this thing away so me and my crew can get back to work.
We got this.
This warehouse usually sits empty.
We were gonna store some inventory today.
Found the lock broken and this big, honkin' thing inside.
Have at it.
Thank you.
Not fair.
You want tech like this, you should've cut off your own hand.
Mack.
Looks like these guys tore each other apart.
Zhang Wei, resident of Monterey Park.
Organ donor.
Say anything about him being a flesh-hungry rage monster?
Uh, no, I'm not seeing anything about that here, so we have to assume that he wasn't until he came in contact with whatever's in that trailer.
Not much here that'll lead us anywhere.
Well... there's that.
There was no buyer there.
No, no, no.
No!
Please, God, no!
No!
I don't deserve to die!
- No!
No!
- Everyone says that.
Yeah, those chargers are hard to find.
Between "Fast and Furious" and "Dukes of Hazzard,"
they wrecked a lot of them.
My boyfriend wrecked his in a street race.
He's pretty broken up.
I guess he was more attached to it than I thought.
I ain't seen none around here, though.
Sorry.
All right.
Thanks, man.
Hey, uh, most of them wrecked movie cars, they're dumped at El Monte Junk and Salvage.
If your boyfriend wants to fix his ride up, might want to go over there and find scraps.
Thanks.
Maybe he'll go there.
Daisy's in Los Angeles.
There was an eyewitness, now dead, and I just received Yo-Yo's check-in report a week early, which means Coulson and Mack are there, too, no doubt, trying to track Daisy down.
- Sounds right.
- You know it is, because according to the logs, you called Coulson back to H.Q. for resupply yourself.
Why, if not to give him that intel in person, knowing it's against the Director's orders?
I didn't send them.
I don't have the authority.
They acted on their own.
You knew I'd find out.
Why not tell me?
I have daily lie detection.
- That's why.
- And now I have to report it, which means now I either look like I'm incompetent or colluding with you.
Wouldn't want you falling out of favor with the director.
Okay.
I get it.
It's abundantly clear you're uncomfortable with my new position --
I just want to know how comfortable you are with it.
You actually trust this guy?
Our team split up to lead departments, given different colors.
'Cause we're experts?
No.
I think the Director broke up the band on purpose.
Of course he did!
As soon as Talbot gave the location of this base to the president, things changed.
I knew we'd be divided, undermined, kept in the dark, so I have been clawing for as much power as I can possibly grab to keep a modicum of control over any of this.
After all we've been through...
I don't trust the new Director, but he trusts me, so now, in order to keep that trust,
I must take the appropriate action to address this break in protocol.
I'm sending you and your strike team to take Coulson and Mack out of the field, by force, if necessary.
Clean up whatever mess he's in.
That's an order.
Yes, ma'am.
Place them at the four corners of the exterior of the building.
That'll give us visuals through the walls.
This could be very dangerous.
So much could go wrong.
Ultron, yes.
I know.
But this is not A.I.
A.I. is banned, and that's good.
This is mimicry of human behavior.
Still, in the wrong hands, this could be used as a weapon.
- Is that the idea?
- No, absolutely not.
No --
Look, I know the dangers.
That's why I've been -
- I've been reticent to divulge.
I don't know these new people at S.H.I.E.L.D.
But a weapon is absolutely not the idea.
Well, then, why?
What's she for?
Why not let Aida tell you herself?
Hello.
I'm glad to finally shake your hand, Leopold.
Where's Jemma?
We were hoping that she would come.
S-She's, uh.
Indisposed, I'm afraid.
Aida...
I was wondering --
Yes, Agent Fitz?
I was wondering if you could tell me exactly what it is you are designed for.
Of course.
Dr. Radcliffe, time and again, has expressed his deep regret for causing pain when all he ever wanted was to prevent it.
He speaks often of the pain that you and Agent Simmons have had to suffer, having lost so many friends --
Lincoln Campbell,
Andrew Garner, Antoine Triplett --
Okay, stop it, stop.
You don't have to list them.
Sorry.
The hope is that I will be able to prevent future tragedies -- save the lives of agents by putting myself in harm's way in their place.
- To kill?
- No.
I am incapable of that.
I will protect.
I will serve as a decoy target, a safeguard A shield.
Okay.
T-Turn her off.
We can't tell Simmons about this.
What?
Don't we want to move forward?
Her approval is --
This is too dangerous to show the new Director.
We don't know what he'd do with it.
And she would have to tell him, so... she can't know.
Not until...
Until...?
Until she's perfect.
They're walking in now, six.
Really convivial-looking fellows.
At least four of them are packing.
We should be tapped into surveillance now.
Let's see what we get.
Where are the other two men?
We had to leave them at the pick-up site.
Explain.
Those guys were transferring the box into the armored transport.
Maybe they peeked inside or something.
But they went berserk and tore into each other.
There was blood everywhere.
We put two bullets in each of them and locked them in the truck.
No, no.
Look, we were freaking out.
We had to get out of there!
Did you burn their bodies or dump the truck in the ocean?
Because if not, they can be traced back here.
They probably saw what was in this box and were fighting over it, you idiot.
I have been told it's powerful enough to bring our new enhanced enemies to their knees.
We get on comms and call the Zephyr for backup, headquarters will know we're on Daisy's trail.
No orders to pull out.
She's been tracking this sale.
- She could show up here any minute.
- I don't know.
Let's let this play out, see if anyone else makes an appearance.
Excuse me.
Uh, the yard's closing.
To sell a junker, you can call the number on the gate.
Oh, no, I'm not here for that.
I, uh --
Uh, sorry.
What's your name?
Robbie.
Well, Robbie, I am looking for a guy with a sweet black '69 Charger.
Maybe he bought some parts here.
Sorry.
Doesn't ring a bell.
I only work nights once a week.
Uh, well, maybe I'll -
- I'll come back in the morning.
Thank you.
Or... there's a book of sales you can flip through in the main office.
Not really an office.
More of a trailer, but I can show you.
That would be great, thank you.
What the hell?
What was that?
A breath of fresh air.
Get away from me!
That's it there.
So, you live around here?
No, I used to.
I'm just in town for a couple days, soaking up the sun.
Strange place to spend your vacation.
Not a great neighborhood.
So...
You've got the devil inside you, too.
What's going on, guys?
Call for backup, yeah?
We can't wait for Daisy.
These guys might kill somebody besides each other.
Yeah.
Us.
Z One, we got a situation.
We need a little help here.
That was efficient.
You guys know what to do.
Damn.
All clear.
You shouldn't have gotten involved.
Serial killers always complain when we try to intervene.
I only kill asesinos who deserve it.
It's vengeance, chica.
For what?
You killed a detective.
But he had blood on his hands.
A teacher.
A pedophile.
You don't get to decide who deserves to die.
I'm not the one who decides.
Do it.
I deserve it.
Do it.
Thank for the ride, Janet.
You never accept rides.
Bus break down?
Or you still trying to holler at Janet's little sister?
Maybe.
I only needed a ride to help Canelo balance some books because my brother didn't finish high school.
Yo, I finished high school... in the 11th grade.
Everyone's attached to something.
Spent a lot of time in here.
Too much.
My wallet's starting to get sick of it.
Your little side mission didn't go unnoticed.
Well, you showed up, so, yeah.
The Director will want to have words with you at H.Q.
No Daisy, huh?
No.
But she was tracking these guys, so maybe this is a win.
I don't know.
The ground team is checking for contagion, but hopefully, whatever messed with these guys' heads is no longer an issue.
We're gonna analyze the box it came in.
It's good... to have a moment, just us.
It's been a long time since we had a moment alone.
You okay?
Yeah.
Just a long day.
Well, take advantage of the down time.
Who knows what tomorrow holds?
[Music] [Car engine revving]
[Gun cocks]
[Tires screeching, horn honks]
[Grunts] It's coming!
Get ready!
[Tires screeching] Go, man, go!
Aah!
Man:
Damn it!
Damn it!
Engine's dead!
[Tires screech]
Get it.
Kill it!
Shoot anything that moves.
[Breathing shakily]
[Rustling] [Firing]
Help.
He ...
He got me.
He'll kill us all.
Give me that damn thing.
Get back!
[Gunfire, woman screaming]
[Engine revving in distance]
[Music]
[Tires screeching]
Man:
Shoot it!
Shoot it now!
[Gunfire]
[Screams]
[Panting]
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No, please!
No!
[Screams]
[Tires screeching]
[Sirens wail]
[Rumbling]
4x01 - "The Ghost"
You need to sacrifice everything if you want to survive.
Hmm.
That's funny.
'Cause I thought I would just...
Mm.
Yeah, that's one way to go. [Sighs]
[Chuckles] Want a beer?
It's 6:00 in the morning.
What, are you Hemingway?
No, is that real?
When did we cross the North Pole?
An hour ago.
Oh, my gosh.
It's hard to keep track in this thing.
We shouldn't have to stay on clock when we're moving through time zones.
I mean, what is that ...
three continents in two days?
If you count Berlin.
We were only there three hours.
Yeah, we knew that Inhuman call was a hoax as soon as we stepped foot in the apartment, saw that bong.
- I could smell it from the hallway.
- Jokers.
Hungry for attention.
And potato chips.
If the munchies was a superpower, they'd be signing the Sokovia Accords as we speak.
[Breathes deeply]
You should let me work on Lola.
I warned you.
Everything in Lola is custom.
Yeah, yeah, everything is custom.
But it would be something to do.
There's only so many times a guy can win cash off you... sir.
You got to stop calling me that.
- We're being called back to H.Q.
- They say why?
We're not due for a restock for another 10 days.
- No idea.
They said it's classified.
- Oh, everything is nowadays.
[Breathes deeply] All right, we'll need full inventory.
Medical, provisions, fuel cells, and make sure you tell the crew they'll need to call ahead if they want off our next deployment.
Agent Thompson...
- Wonder what that's about.
- Oh, I don't know.
- It'll be good to see Fitz and Simmons.
- And May.
Yeah...
I think you look forward to that more than I do.
Hyah!
What was his mistake?
[Music]
You know I'm not gonna talk.
He didn't anticipate your back kick.
Opened himself up.
His mistake was he tapped out.
[Motor whirring]
- Piper.
- Okay, people!
What, you never seen the biggest plane ever built before?
!
Next pairing, on the mat!
- How long has it been?
- Six weeks in the air.
Only the Quinjet touched down.
- Is that a record for Zephyr One?
- It is.
It was supposed to be even longer.
- You know who called us in?
- I do.
You?
Okay.
Now I know something's up.
I got word from contacts in law enforcement, Los Angeles.
Two civilians were violently killed.
Mack:
Mysterious burns, heads bashed in, spine pulled out of his ...
Wow.
Many conflicting accounts, but all agree... it was odd.
Odd?
Isn't that our wheelhouse?
He's right.
Why call us in?
We could be headed to the scene right now to confirm the presence of an enhanced person,
- if there is one.
- If it checks out, we bag and tag.
We handle these on the fly.
Didn't exactly want to send this out on the wire.
May, you're not sharing again.
Now would be a really good time to share.
The police also have another victim in custody.
Critical condition.
Under sedation, he mentioned seeing a girl, saying it was the one from the news.
Quake.
Which you didn't want to send over the wire.
You were pulled off Daisy's case.
The Director thinks she slipped through our fingers too many times.
The Director thinks you let her.
No, we pursued her.
She was a ghost.
Well, in his infinite wisdom, he says you're now forbidden to.
But you're telling us this because... ?
In case we want to do something about it.
Look, I can bury this until the official police report comes through.
That'll buy us a few hours lead time.
Get to L.A., sniff around.
Yeah.
We have an active Inhuman asset in Los Angeles that's due for a check-in soon enough.
It'll justify our presence there, but as soon as the report's filed, they'll pull us out.
And the armed forces will be sent in after her.
With orders to kill.
- To kill?
- If she's responsible for these bodies.
- That's not Daisy's M.O.
- The world knows her as Quake, and Quake is an outlaw who takes down banks and bridges.
- Oh, come on.
We both know
- She's hunting violent radicals.
she's tracking these fanatics, the Watchdogs, trying to take down their funding, their ... their escape routes.
Regardless, you should fuel up and get back up in the air ASAP.
Find her before the military does something bad.
Or Daisy does something worse.
[Monitors beeping]
Man:
Hey.
You can't be here.
Stop right there.
[Rumbling] [Screams]
How are we feeling today?
[Rumbling]
I've been tracking weapon sales, and I know you were hired to steal one.
You even jacked a big rig to help carry it out.
We were just paid for a smash-and-grab job.
Who was that hunting you?
[Grunts] Man:
Open the door!
He nailed me, but we almost got away.
Who was it?
- Did he kill my friends?
- All but one.
But you're gonna have to give me a little bit more if I'm gonna find him alive.
[Shuddered breathing]
Save him, please, before he gets burned, too.
You'll see your buddy again once you heal up.
- Just tell me what's ...
- [Grunting] No.
No.
It's too late for me.
They say when the Rider burns you [breathing heavily] he burns your soul.
[Grunting]
And a soul can never heal.
[Grunting]
[Indistinct shouting]
[Rumbling]
Man:
Stop right there!
[Echoing] Hello?
Hello?
I hear my voice echo, but it sounds strange in my head.
The detail is amazing.
However, I am 3 feet off the ground.
Fitz:
Wait.
What?
Hold on.
Damn it.
Uh, well, I did adjust the Y axis earlier for some reason.
- What does that look like now?
- Better.
The CPU seems to be handling the high poly count.
Textures are impeccable.
We should build a place to get away ... a meadow or a cottage somewhere.
[Sighs] I wish it were ever this quiet.
[Monitors beeping]
Direct-current stimulation.
Creates the other senses like touch and taste but also takes feedback.
So I've just mapped your brain's response ...
Response to the environment.
Of course.
Dr. Radcliffe came up with the architecture?
Yeah.
Yeah, he calls it "The Framework."
But all the transcranial apparatus, that's all me.
No.
Of course, you're brilliant, too.
Of course.
'Cause soon you won't even need the eyewear or the earwear, 'cause it'll all be inside your head.
So May's strike team will be able to train virtually instead of May constantly breaking their ribs.
Nathanson:
Hey, hey.
Authorized personnel only, pal.
No pass, no entry.
- Who the hell are you?
- Leave them be, Nathanson.
They have more reason to be here than you do.
Wow.
A lot of new faces.
Good to see yours.
Six weeks.
That's a record.
- Heard you got a promotion.
- Oh, yeah, and a title.
Yeah, Special Advisor to the Director in Science and Technology.
Or "SADIST."
- They keeping you busy?
- With busywork, mostly.
Yeah, and random state-of-the-art lie-detector tests.
So that's the cost of being in the Director's inner circle.
Yeah, he's paranoid about what happened the last time S.H.I.E.L.D. was government-run.
Calls it his Widespread Infiltration Monitoring Program.
Or "WIMP." Hey, uh, you should join us 'cause we're gonna go to Radcliffe's and watch the
Aberdeen-Inverness Caley Thistle League cup final.
They're ...
Those are football teams.
I'm not sure they are, Turbo.
Unfortunately, we have to be wheels-up in 10 minutes, so...
Okay.
All right.
Well, strictly business, then.
Aw, yeah.
New toys?
The exploding pen that you asked for.
I can't imagine a use for it.
You never wanted one?
[Chuckles]
And for you, Direct... uh, Agent Coulson with new bells and whistles.
And the directions will be there when you boot it up.
What's, uh ...
What's the assignment?
[Sighs]
- It's classified.
- Right.
Everything is these days.
- Fitz, sadly, um...
- Yeah, you can't make the match, either.
- I have to finish my reports.
- Yeah, no, I get it.
That's okay.
Just a shame we hardly get to see each other.
- Any of us.
- [Sighs] Yes, well...
At least it's better than the friends we'll never see again.
[Sighs]
[Laptop beeps] [Music]
_
_ [Door closes]
[Breathing shakily]
We just stole a box.
I don't even know what was inside of it.
We ...
We loaded it onto an 18-wheeler, we parked it in a warehouse, and we just left it.
Man:
Left it for who?
[Groans] The Chinatown Crew.
They set the job up and were willing to pay big.
[Grunts, groans]
Lies.
Aryan Brotherhood working with the Chinese?
I swear!
I swear that's all I know.
Where's this warehouse?
I ...
I can't tell you that, man.
My people are gonna be mowed down in the payback ... the ones you didn't already kill.
If you don't tell me, you'll have to tell him.
Coulson:
This guy's missing.
The rest are dead.
Aryan Brotherhood.
They're not my kind of brothers.
They've been know to work for cash.
Burglary, assault ... sort of the value meal of hired guns.
They're suspected in the recent theft of this big rig.
- Probably prepping for a larger score.
- Big, yellow, hard to hide.
So, what, are we looking for this thing?
And if Daisy's chasing the same angle, maybe we get to the finish line first.
I'll greet her when she arrives.
- Davis:
Agent Coulson?
- Davis.
Preparing for decent.
Inhuman asset will be waiting on the tarmac.
[Tablet beeping]
What?
[Music]
- How's your wife, Davis?
- Getting bigger every day.
- Oh.
Don't tell her that.
- More beautiful every day.
[Chuckles]
There you go.
Mack.
Mack:
Yo-Yo.
[Sighs]
- Just have a few questions.
- I'm all yours.
Uh, so, I see you went to Colombia for a week.
Mm-hmm.
Mm.
And, uh, tickets to Miami coming up.
Yes.
Do you watch me sleep or shower or... ?
Just procedure.
You don't have to use a satellite to get to know me better.
Just ask me to dinner again.
You know the rules about fraternizing with assets in the field. [Chuckles]
Oh, we haven't fraternized anything yet.
And I thought you were breaking the rules, coming to do my checkup early just to see me.
Or are you here because, uh, there's been a lot of little earthquakes lately?
Daisy could be in the area.
But officially, that's not the mission.
Doesn't matter.
We'll never find her.
She's always one step ahead.
What is the official mission?
Can I help?
Here's where I have to remind you that Sokovia Accords,
- which you signed...
- Oh, all right.
... require approval by the United Nations subcommittee...
- before an enhanced indiv...
- Rules, rules, rules.
Blah, blah, blah.
S.H.I.E.L.D. moves too slow now, Turtleman.
- I prefer to move fast.
- Uh...
Mack, they found the truck.
Good to see you, too, Coulson!
Well, if you're in Miami, look me up.
Just because we can't work together doesn't mean we can't live a little.
[Sighs]
[Crowd cheering on television]
[Doorbell rings]
Hey, just in time.
They've just taken to the pitch.
Where's Jemma?
Is she not coming?
Yeah, she wanted to.
Same story.
All work and no play, huh?
That's a bit disappointing.
Still, make yourself comfortable.
I'm just, uh, finishing cleaning up.
[Music]
Yeah, should be pretty lopsided, don't you think?
Their keeper's absolutely crap...
Oh, my gosh!
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I had no idea there was somebody here.
Hello.
[Sighs] You ...
You weren't meant to see that.
Hello.
I'm glad to final...
- Hello.
I'm glad to final...
- Fitz, meet Aida.
- Hello.
I'm glad to final...
- She's, uh, crashed.
Hello.
I'm glad to final...
Hello.
I'm glad to final...
Hello.
I'm glad to final...
Hello.
I'm glad to final...
Hello.
I'm glad to final...
Hello.
I'm glad to final...
[Powers down]
[Remote beeping]
- What the hell?
- Well, I've just upped her PSU to compensate for image processing.
Must have overcranked it.
I'll reboot.
Unh-unh, that's not what I meant.
I meant...
- ...what the hell?
!
- Well, you've already met Aida, digital personal assistant, as a voice on the computer.
So, uh...
- I built her a body.
- Yeah, a naked body.
I-I was just now installing new hardware, updating her gyroscopic sensors.
I'm not some sicko.
When did you build this?
Have you forgotten the very strict stipulations that came with your pardon?
You are not allowed experimentation
- without approval and oversight!
- Oversight, I know.
I'm well aware of that, yeah.
That's why I wanted Simmons here.
I wanted to show both of you.
Look.
This has been a lifelong dream of mine, Fitz.
When I saw the work you and Simmons were doing in replicating human tissue and internal bone structure in Coulson's hand, I knew ...
I knew right then that this was within reach.
- A robot?
- Not just a robot.
It's one that can cross the uncanny valley and come out the other side ...
pass for a human.
I mean, it has bloody micro-expressions.
She.
It's a ...
It's definitely a "she" 'cause I saw ...
- Yes...
- She has micro-expressions, full range of motion.
I mean, physically, it's ...
- she's nearly perfect.
- She is very realistic.
[Music]
Now, mentally, well, you've spoken with Aida.
She's bright, she laughs at the jokes
I programmed her to recognize, but she's never pass the Turing test.
At the moment, that's a pipe dream.
However, I think, with your help...
No, no.
No, no, no, no!
We have to report this right away.
- You could lose everything.
- I know.
- Or you could go to jail.
- I know!
I know, you're right.
Full disclosure at this time is the best course of action.
I ...
I agree.
Hmm.
At least let me show you how it works.
[Air brakes hiss]
They're in town.
I supposed you guessed that, texting me.
They're looking for a truck.
That mean you have something for me?
They watch my every move, but certain moves they can't see.
You can't get these over the counter.
S.H.I.E.L.D. issue for rapid bone healing, yes?
I know you splintered your bones when you first powered up.
- Are you pushing yourself too hard?
- Don't worry about me.
You can't use your powers too much.
- Your body will break down.
- I'm fine.
I'm surprised you're still in town.
You're usually moving and moving.
Are you, uh, still hunting those perros rabiosos?
It's not just the Watchdogs now.
Local gangs have been working for them, which I... don't understand.
I was tracing the sale of a weapon, and I...
I think I may have stumbled upon a serial killer.
Ooh.
Fun.
He live around here?
He mostly hits this area, but he's hard to track down, leaves no traces behind, operates alone.
Sound familiar?
I thought maybe you were, uh, growing roots, they say.
- L.A. used to be where you hang out, no?
- No roots.
Everyone gets attached to something eventually.
Don't forget to wait two stops after I get off.
Yeah, yeah.
Hey.
Send me a picture of this guy.
Maybe I can cover some ground if I know what he looks like.
No, I still haven't gotten a good look at him yet, so just...
take care of yourself, okay?
But thank you for the S.H.I.E.L.D. intel.
They won't give up on you, especially Coulson.
All he wants is to find you.
Well, that's too bad, 'cause there's only one thing I want.
Oh, yeah?
What's that?
Nothing to lose.
Here's the Mapping-Action Eyewear you requested.
Should help your team in case of a blind takedown.
- Great.
Thanks.
- I need you to sign for it.
I don't get the new color-coded security-level rainbow of...
- What's it called?
- The "Spectrum of Security."
Why do I, level red, have to go through you, level orange, to request hardware?
Shouldn't red be higher than orange?
Well, orange encompasses both red and yellow, so...
It's hard to explain, but the Director didn't want to use numbers because he didn't want any team member to feel less than.
Well, you do have a higher clearance than me.
Only in most instances.
I feel less than.
Hey, we just had a report come in.
A death in a hospital in Los Angeles.
Suspicious circumstances.
Suspect is an Asian female.
You think it might be Daisy.
I'm going to look into it.
I just wondered if you'd heard anything from your law-enforcement contacts?
I'm mostly in the dark these days.
Why don't you ask the Director?
Since you're one of the few people allowed or willing to do that.
[Spray-pain can rattles]
What you got there?
Didn't hear?
Word is, he hit again last night.
- Two dead in the street.
- Who?
Ghost Rider.
You must not be from around here.
Do you know where I can find him?
Nobody does.
Everybody that sees his face ends up on this wall.
"Everyone gets attached to something."
[Engine revs, tires screech]
Man:
We got to get this truck out of here.
What are you, the Feds?
Something like that.
We'll be sealing the scene.
Not for long, I hope.
I was just gonna have this guy tow this thing away so me and my crew can get back to work.
We got this.
Man:
This warehouse usually sits empty.
We were gonna store some inventory today.
Found the lock broken and this big, honkin' thing inside.
- Have at it.
- Coulson:
Thank you.
[Wrist beeps]
[Music]
Not fair.
You want tech like this, you should've cut off your own hand.
Mack.
Okay.
Mack:
Looks like these guys tore each other apart.
Zhang Wei, resident of Monterey Park.
Organ donor.
Say anything about him being a flesh-hungry rage monster?
Uh, no, I'm not seeing anything about that here, so we have to assume that he wasn't until he came in contact with whatever's in that trailer.
Not much here that'll lead us anywhere.
Well... there's that.
[Door slams]
[Keys rattling]
There was no buyer there.
[Car door closes]
[Engine starts, revs]
No, no, no.
No!
Please, God, no!
No!
I don't deserve to die!
- No!
No!
- Everyone says that.
No!
No!
No!
Diego:
Yeah, those chargers are hard to find.
Between "Fast and Furious" and "Dukes of Hazzard,"
they wrecked a lot of them.
My boyfriend wrecked his in a street race.
He's pretty broken up.
I guess he was more attached to it than I thought.
I ain't seen none around here, though.
- Sorry.
- All right.
Thanks, man.
Hey, uh, most of them wrecked movie cars, they're dumped at El Monte Junk and Salvage.
If your boyfriend wants to fix his ride up, might want to go over there and find scraps.
Thanks.
Maybe he'll go there.
Simmons:
Daisy's in Los Angeles.
There was an eyewitness, now dead, and I just received Yo-Yo's check-in report a week early, which means Coulson and Mack are there, too,
- no doubt, trying to track Daisy down.
- Sounds right.
You know it is, because according to the logs, you called Coulson back to H.Q. for resupply yourself.
Why, if not to give him that intel in person, knowing it's against the Director's orders?
I didn't send them.
I don't have the authority.
- They acted on their own.
- You knew I'd find out.
Why not tell me?
I have daily lie detection.
- That's why.
- And now I have to report it, which means now I either look like I'm incompetent
- or colluding with you.
- Wouldn't want you falling out of favor with the director.
[Sighs]
Okay.
I get it.
It's abundantly clear you're uncomfortable with my new position ...
I just want to know how comfortable you are with it.
You actually trust this guy?
Our team split up to lead departments, given different colors.
'Cause we're experts?
No.
I think the Director broke up the band on purpose.
Of course he did!
[Sighs]
As soon as Talbot gave the location of this base to the president, things changed.
I knew we'd be divided, undermined, kept in the dark, so I have been clawing for as much power as I can possibly grab to keep a modicum of control over any of this.
After all we've been through...
[Sighs]
I don't trust the new Director, but he trusts me, so now, in order to keep that trust,
I must take the appropriate action to address this break in protocol.
I'm sending you and your strike team to take Coulson and Mack out of the field, by force, if necessary.
Clean up whatever mess he's in.
- That's an order.
- Yes, ma'am.
Mack:
Place them at the four corners of the exterior of the building.
That'll give us visuals through the walls.
Fitz:
This could be very dangerous.
- So much could go wrong.
- Ultron, yes.
I know.
But this is not A.I. A.I. is banned, and that's good.
This is mimicry of human behavior.
Still, in the wrong hands, this could be used as a weapon.
- Is that the idea?
- No, absolutely not.
No ...
Look, I know the dangers.
That's why I've been ...
I've been reticent to divulge.
I don't know these new people at S.H.I.E.L.D.
But a weapon is absolutely not the idea.
Well, then, why?
What's she for?
Why not let Aida tell you herself?
[Remote beeps] [Silent whir]
[Music]
Hello.
I'm glad to finally shake your hand, Leopold.
Where's Jemma?
We were hoping that she would come.
S-She's, uh...
indisposed, I'm afraid.
Aida...
- I was wondering ...
- Yes, Agent Fitz?
[Breathes deeply]
I was wondering if you could tell me exactly what it is you are designed for.
Of course.
Dr. Radcliffe, time and again, has expressed his deep regret for causing pain when all he ever wanted was to prevent it.
He speaks often of the pain that you and Agent Simmons have had to suffer, having lost so many friends ...
Lincoln Campbell,
Andrew Garner, Antoine Triplett ...
Okay, stop it, stop.
You don't have to list them.
Sorry.
The hope is that I will be able to prevent future tragedies ... save the lives of agents by putting myself in harm's way in their place.
- To kill?
- No.
I am incapable of that.
I will protect.
I will serve as a decoy target, a safeguard...
- ... a shield.
- Okay.
T-Turn her off.
[Breathes deeply]
[Remote beeps] [Powers down]
[Sighs]
We can't tell Simmons about this.
What?
Don't we want to move forward?
Her approval is ...
This is too dangerous to show the new Director.
We don't know what he'd do with it.
And she would have to tell him, so... she can't know.
- Not until...
- Until... ?
Until she's perfect.
[Music]
[Music]
Coulson:
They're walking in now, six.
Really convivial-looking fellows.
At least four of them are packing.
Mack:
We should be tapped into surveillance now.
Let's see what we get.
[Tablet beeps]
Where are the other two men?
We had to leave them at the pick-up site.
Explain.
Those guys were transferring the box into the armored transport.
Maybe they peeked inside or something.
But they went berserk and tore into each other.
There was blood everywhere.
We put two bullets in each of them and locked them in the truck.
No, no.
Look, we were freaking out.
We had to get out of there!
Did you burn their bodies or dump the truck in the ocean?
Because if not, they can be traced back here.
They probably saw what was in this box and were fighting over it, you idiot!
I have been told it's powerful enough to bring our new enhanced enemies to their knees.
We get on comms and call the Zephyr for backup, headquarters will know we're on Daisy's trail.
No orders to pull out.
She's been tracking this sale.
- She could show up here any minute.
- I don't know.
Let's let this play out, see if anyone else makes an appearance.
[Music]
Daisy:
Excuse me.
Uh, the yard's closing.
To sell a junker, you can call the number on the gate.
Oh, no, I'm not here for that.
I, uh ...
Uh, sorry.
What's your name?
Robbie.
Well, Robbie, I am looking for a guy with a sweet black '69 Charger.
Maybe he bought some parts here.
Sorry.
Doesn't ring a bell.
I only work nights once a week.
Uh, well, maybe I'll ...
I'll come back in the morning.
Thank you.
Or...
there's a book of sales you can flip through in the main office.
Not really an office.
More of a trailer, but I can show you.
That would be great, thank you.
[Men gasping]
[Tablet whirs] The hell... ?
What was that?
A breath of fresh air.
[Ghostly shriek] [Gasps]
[Men grunting]
Get away from me!
That's it there.
- So, you live around here?
- No, I used to.
I'm just in town for a couple days, soaking up the sun.
Strange place to spend your vacation.
[Keys rattling]
Not a great neighborhood.
[Rumbling]
[Breathing heavily]
So... you've got the devil inside you, too.
What's going on, guys?
[Tablet whirs]
Call for backup, yeah?
We can't wait for Daisy.
These guys might kill somebody besides each other.
Yeah.
Us.
Z One, we got a situation.
We need a little help here.
[Gunshot]
That was efficient.
[Tablet beeps]
[Goggles beep, whir]
[Goggles beeping, whirring]
You guys know what to do.
[Music]
Damn.
May:
All clear.
[Fighting sounds] [Music]
[Rumbling]
You shouldn't have gotten involved.
Serial killers always complain when we try to intervene.
I only kill asesinos who deserve it.
It's vengeance, chica.
For what?
You killed a detective.
But he had blood on his hands.
- A teacher!
- A pedophile.
[Rumbling]
You don't get to decide who deserves to die.
I'm not the one who decides.
[Grunts]
[Music]
[Rumbling]
[Rumbling]
[Panting]
Do it. [Panting] I deserve it.
Do it.
[Grunts]
[Engine starts]
[Tires screech]
[Grunts]
[Brakes squeak]
[Music]
[Music stops]
Hey.
Thank for the ride, Janet.
You never accept rides.
Bus break down?
Or you still trying to holler at Janet's little sister?
Maybe.
I only needed a ride to help Canelo balance some books because my brother didn't finish high school.
Yo, I finished high school...
in the 11th grade.
[Chuckles]
"Everyone's attached to something."
[Engine starts]
Coulson:
We'll return in a moment.
[Indistinct conversations]
- Spent a lot of time in here?
- Too much.
My wallet's starting to get sick of it.
Your little side mission didn't go unnoticed.
Well, you showed up, so, yeah.
The Director will want to have words with you at H.Q.
[Chuckles]
[Sighs]
- No Daisy, huh?
- No.
But she was tracking these guys, so maybe this is a win.
I don't know.
The ground team is checking for contagion, but hopefully, whatever messed with these guys' heads is no longer an issue.
We're gonna analyze the box it came in.
It's good...
to have a moment, just us.
It's been a long time since we had a moment alone.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
Just a long day.
Well, take advantage of the down time.
Who knows what tomorrow holds?
It's coming!
Get ready!
Go, man, go!
Aah!
Damn it!
Damn it!
Engine's dead!
Get it.
Kill it!
Shoot anything that moves.
Help.
He...
He got me.
He'll kill us all.
Give me that damn thing.
Get back!
Shoot it!
Shoot it now!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No, please!
No!
4x01 - "The Ghost"
You need to sacrifice everything if you want to survive.
Hmm.
That's funny.
'Cause I thought I would just...
Mm.
Yeah, that's one way to go.
Want a beer?
It's 6:00 in the morning.
What, are you Hemingway?
No, is that real?
When did we cross the North Pole?
An hour ago.
Oh, my gosh.
It's hard to keep track in this thing.
We shouldn't have to stay on clock when we're moving through time zones.
I mean, what is that...
three continents in two days?
If you count Berlin.
We were only there three hours.
Yeah, we knew that Inhuman call was a hoax as soon as we stepped foot in the apartment, saw that bong.
- I could smell it from the hallway.
- Jokers.
Hungry for attention.
And potato chips.
If the munchies was a superpower, they'd be signing the Sokovia Accords as we speak.
You should let me work on Lola.
I warned you.
Everything in Lola is custom.
Yeah, yeah, everything is custom.
But it would be something to do.
There's only so many times a guy can win cash off you... sir.
You got to stop calling me that.
- We're being called back to H.Q.
- They say why?
We're not due for a restock for another 10 days.
- No idea.
They said it's classified.
- Oh, everything is nowadays.
All right, we'll need full inventory.
Medical, provisions, fuel cells, and make sure you tell the crew they'll need to call ahead if they want off our next deployment.
Agent Thompson...
- Wonder what that's about.
- Oh, I don't know.
- It'll be good to see Fitz and Simmons.
- And May.
Yeah...
I think you look forward to that more than I do.
Hyah!
What was his mistake?
You know I'm not gonna talk.
He didn't anticipate your back kick.
Opened himself up.
His mistake was he tapped out.
- Piper.
- Okay, people!
What, you never seen the biggest plane ever built before?
!
Next pairing, on the mat!
- How long has it been?
- Six weeks in the air.
Only the Quinjet touched down.
- Is that a record for Zephyr One?
- It is.
It was supposed to be even longer.
- You know who called us in?
- I do.
You?
Okay.
Now I know something's up.
I got word from contacts in law enforcement, Los Angeles.
Two civilians were violently killed.
Mysterious burns, heads bashed in, spine pulled out of his...
Wow.
Many conflicting accounts, but all agree... it was odd.
Odd?
Isn't that our wheelhouse?
He's right.
Why call us in?
We could be headed to the scene right now to confirm the presence of an enhanced person,
- if there is one.
- If it checks out, we bag and tag.
We handle these on the fly.
Didn't exactly want to send this out on the wire.
May, you're not sharing again.
Now would be a really good time to share.
The police also have another victim in custody.
Critical condition.
Under sedation, he mentioned seeing a girl, saying it was the one from the news.
Quake.
Which you didn't want to send over the wire.
You were pulled off Daisy's case.
The Director thinks she slipped through our fingers too many times.
The Director thinks you let her.
No, we pursued her.
She was a ghost.
Well, in his infinite wisdom, he says you're now forbidden to.
But you're telling us this because...?
In case we want to do something about it.
Look, I can bury this until the official police report comes through.
That'll buy us a few hours lead time.
Get to L.A., sniff around.
Yeah.
We have an active Inhuman asset in Los Angeles that's due for a check-in soon enough.
It'll justify our presence there, but as soon as the report's filed, they'll pull us out.
And the armed forces will be sent in after her.
With orders to kill.
- To kill?
- If she's responsible for these bodies.
- That's not Daisy's M.O.
- The world knows her as Quake, and Quake is an outlaw who takes down banks and bridges.
- Oh, come on.
We both know
- She's hunting violent radicals.
She's tracking these fanatics, the Watchdogs, trying to take down their funding, their... their escape routes.
Regardless, you should fuel up and get back up in the air ASAP.
Find her before the military does something bad.
Or Daisy does something worse.
Hey.
You can't be here.
Stop right there.
How are we feeling today?
I've been tracking weapon sales, and I know you were hired to steal one.
You even jacked a big rig to help carry it out.
We were just paid for a smash-and-grab job.
Who was that hunting you?
Open the door!
He nailed me, but we almost got away.
Who was it?
- Did he kill my friends?
- All but one.
But you're gonna have to give me a little bit more if I'm gonna find him alive.
Save him, please, before he gets burned, too.
You'll see your buddy again once you heal up.
- Just tell me what's...
- No.
No.
It's too late for me.
They say when the Rider burns you he burns your soul.
And a soul can never heal.
Stop right there!
Hello?
Hello?
I hear my voice echo, but it sounds strange in my head.
The detail is amazing.
However, I am 3 feet off the ground.
Wait.
What?
Hold on.
Damn it.
Uh, well, I did adjust the Y axis earlier for some reason.
- What does that look like now?
- Better.
The CPU seems to be handling the high poly count.
Textures are impeccable.
We should build a place to get away... a meadow or a cottage somewhere.
I wish it were ever this quiet.
Direct-current stimulation.
Creates the other senses like touch and taste but also takes feedback.
So I've just mapped your brain's response...
Response to the environment.
Of course.
Dr. Radcliffe came up with the architecture?
Yeah.
Yeah, he calls it "The Framework."
But all the transcranial apparatus, that's all me.
No.
Of course, you're brilliant, too.
Of course.
'Cause soon you won't even need the eyewear or the earwear, 'cause it'll all be inside your head.
So May's strike team will be able to train virtually instead of May constantly breaking their ribs.
Hey, hey.
Authorized personnel only, pal.
No pass, no entry.
- Who the hell are you?
- Leave them be, Nathanson.
They have more reason to be here than you do.
Wow.
A lot of new faces.
Good to see yours.
Six weeks.
That's a record.
- Heard you got a promotion.
- Oh, yeah, and a title.
Yeah, Special Advisor to the Director in Science and Technology.
Or "SADIST."
- They keeping you busy?
- With busywork, mostly.
Yeah, and random state-of-the-art lie-detector tests.
So that's the cost of being in the Director's inner circle.
Yeah, he's paranoid about what happened the last time S.H.I.E.L.D. was government-run.
Calls it his Widespread Infiltration Monitoring Program.
Or "WIMP." Hey, uh, you should join us 'cause we're gonna go to Radcliffe's and watch the
Aberdeen-Inverness Caley Thistle League cup final.
They're...
Those are football teams.
I'm not sure they are, Turbo.
Unfortunately, we have to be wheels-up in 10 minutes, so...
Okay.
All right.
Well, strictly business, then.
Aw, yeah.
New toys?
The exploding pen that you asked for.
I can't imagine a use for it.
You never wanted one?
And for you, Direct... uh, Agent Coulson with new bells and whistles.
And the directions will be there when you boot it up.
What's, uh...
What's the assignment?
- It's classified.
- Right.
Everything is these days.
- Fitz, sadly, um...
- Yeah, you can't make the match, either.
- I have to finish my reports.
- Yeah, no, I get it.
That's okay.
Just a shame we hardly get to see each other.
- Any of us.
- Yes, well...
At least it's better than the friends we'll never see again.
_
_
We just stole a box.
I don't even know what was inside of it.
We...
We loaded it onto an 18-wheeler, we parked it in a warehouse, and we just left it.
Left it for who?
The Chinatown Crew.
They set the job up and were willing to pay big.
Lies.
Aryan Brotherhood working with the Chinese?
I swear!
I swear that's all I know.
Where's this warehouse?
I...
I can't tell you that, man.
My people are gonna be mowed down in the payback... the ones you didn't already kill.
If you don't tell me, you'll have to tell him.
This guy's missing.
The rest are dead.
Aryan Brotherhood.
They're not my kind of brothers.
They've been know to work for cash.
Burglary, assault... sort of the value meal of hired guns.
They're suspected in the recent theft of this big rig.
- Probably prepping for a larger score.
- Big, yellow, hard to hide.
So, what, are we looking for this thing?
And if Daisy's chasing the same angle, maybe we get to the finish line first.
I'll greet her when she arrives.
- Agent Coulson?
- Davis.
Preparing for decent.
Inhuman asset will be waiting on the tarmac.
What?
- How's your wife, Davis?
- Getting bigger every day.
- Oh.
Don't tell her that.
- More beautiful every day.
There you go.
Mack.
Yo-Yo.
- Just have a few questions.
- I'm all yours.
Uh, so, I see you went to Colombia for a week.
Mm-hmm.
Mm.
And, uh, tickets to Miami coming up.
Yes.
Do you watch me sleep or shower or...?
Just procedure.
You don't have to use a satellite to get to know me better.
Just ask me to dinner again.
You know the rules about fraternizing with assets in the field.
Oh, we haven't fraternized anything yet.
And I thought you were breaking the rules, coming to do my checkup early just to see me.
Or are you here because, uh, there's been a lot of little earthquakes lately?
Daisy could be in the area.
But officially, that's not the mission.
Doesn't matter.
We'll never find her.
She's always one step ahead.
What is the official mission?
Can I help?
Here's where I have to remind you that Sokovia Accords,
- which you signed...
- Oh, all right.
...require approval by the United Nations subcommittee...
- before an enhanced indiv...
- Rules, rules, rules.
Blah, blah, blah.
S.H.I.E.L.D. moves too slow now, Turtleman.
- I prefer to move fast.
- Uh...
Mack, they found the truck.
Good to see you, too, Coulson!
Well, if you're in Miami, look me up.
Just because we can't work together doesn't mean we can't live a little.
Hey, just in time.
They've just taken to the pitch.
Where's Jemma?
Is she not coming?
Yeah, she wanted to.
Same story.
All work and no play, huh?
That's a bit disappointing.
Still, make yourself comfortable.
I'm just, uh, finishing cleaning up.
Yeah, should be pretty lopsided, don't you think?
Their keeper's absolutely crap...
Oh, my gosh!
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I had no idea there was somebody here.
Hello.
You...
You weren't meant to see that.
Hello.
I'm glad to final...
- Hello.
I'm glad to final...
- Fitz, meet Aida.
- Hello.
I'm glad to final...
- She's, uh, crashed.
Hello.
I'm glad to final...
Hello.
I'm glad to final...
Hello.
I'm glad to final...
Hello.
I'm glad to final...
Hello.

Hello.

- What the hell?
- Well, I've just upped her PSU to compensate for image processing.
Must have overcranked it.
I'll reboot.
Unh-unh, that's not what I meant.
I meant...
- ...what the hell?
!
- Well, you've already met Aida, digital personal assistant, as a voice on the computer.
So, uh...
- I built her a body.
- Yeah, a naked body.
I-I was just now installing new hardware, updating her gyroscopic sensors.
I'm not some sicko.
When did you build this?
Have you forgotten the very strict stipulations that came with your pardon?
You are not allowed experimentation
- without approval and oversight!
- Oversight, I know.
I'm well aware of that, yeah.
That's why I wanted Simmons here.
I wanted to show both of you.
Look.
This has been a lifelong dream of mine, Fitz.
When I saw the work you and Simmons were doing in replicating human tissue and internal bone structure in Coulson's hand, I knew...
I knew right then that this was within reach.
- A robot?
- Not just a robot.
It's one that can cross the uncanny valley and come out the other side...
pass for a human.
I mean, it has bloody micro-expressions.
She.
It's a...
It's definitely a "she" 'cause I saw...
- Yes...
- She has micro-expressions, full range of motion.
I mean, physically, it's...
- she's nearly perfect.
- She is very realistic.
Now, mentally, well, you've spoken with Aida.
She's bright, she laughs at the jokes
I programmed her to recognize, but she's never pass the Turing test.
At the moment, that's a pipe dream.
However, I think, with your help...
No, no.
No, no, no, no!
We have to report this right away.
- You could lose everything.
- I know.
- Or you could go to jail.
- I know!
I know, you're right.
Full disclosure at this time is the best course of action.
I...
I agree.
Hmm.
At least let me show you how it works.
They're in town.
I supposed you guessed that, texting me.
They're looking for a truck.
That mean you have something for me?
They watch my every move, but certain moves they can't see.
You can't get these over the counter.
S.H.I.E.L.D. issue for rapid bone healing, yes?
I know you splintered your bones when you first powered up.
- Are you pushing yourself too hard?
- Don't worry about me.
You can't use your powers too much.
- Your body will break down.
- I'm fine.
I'm surprised you're still in town.
You're usually moving and moving.
Are you, uh, still hunting those perros rabiosos?
It's not just the Watchdogs now.
Local gangs have been working for them, which I... don't understand.
I was tracing the sale of a weapon, and I...
I think I may have stumbled upon a serial killer.
Ooh.
Fun.
He live around here?
He mostly hits this area, but he's hard to track down, leaves no traces behind, operates alone.
Sound familiar?
I thought maybe you were, uh, growing roots, they say.
- L.A. used to be where you hang out, no?
- No roots.
Everyone gets attached to something eventually.
Don't forget to wait two stops after I get off.
Yeah, yeah.
Hey.
Send me a picture of this guy.
Maybe I can cover some ground if I know what he looks like.
No, I still haven't gotten a good look at him yet, so just... take care of yourself, okay?
But thank you for the S.H.I.E.L.D. intel.
They won't give up on you, especially Coulson.
All he wants is to find you.
Well, that's too bad, 'cause there's only one thing I want.
Oh, yeah?
What's that?
Nothing to lose.
Here's the Mapping-Action Eyewear you requested.
Should help your team in case of a blind takedown.
- Great.
Thanks.
- I need you to sign for it.
I don't get the new color-coded security-level rainbow of...
- What's it called?
- The "Spectrum of Security."
Why do I, level red, have to go through you, level orange, to request hardware?
Shouldn't red be higher than orange?
Well, orange encompasses both red and yellow, so...
It's hard to explain, but the Director didn't want to use numbers because he didn't want any team member to feel less than.
Well, you do have a higher clearance than me.
Only in most instances.
I feel less than.
Hey, we just had a report come in.
A death in a hospital in Los Angeles.
Suspicious circumstances.
Suspect is an Asian female.
You think it might be Daisy.
I'm going to look into it.
I just wondered if you'd heard anything from your law-enforcement contacts?
I'm mostly in the dark these days.
Why don't you ask the Director?
Since you're one of the few people allowed or willing to do that.
What you got there?
Didn't hear?
Word is, he hit again last night.
- Two dead in the street.
- Who?
Ghost Rider.
You must not be from around here.
Do you know where I can find him?
Nobody does.
Everybody that sees his face ends up on this wall.
"Everyone gets attached to something."
We got to get this truck out of here.
What are you, the Feds?
Something like that.
We'll be sealing the scene.
Not for long, I hope.
I was just gonna have this guy tow this thing away so me and my crew can get back to work.
We got this.
This warehouse usually sits empty.
We were gonna store some inventory today.
Found the lock broken and this big, honkin' thing inside.
- Have at it.
- Thank you.
Not fair.
You want tech like this, you should've cut off your own hand.
Mack.
Okay.
Looks like these guys tore each other apart.
Zhang Wei, resident of Monterey Park.
Organ donor.
Say anything about him being a flesh-hungry rage monster?
Uh, no, I'm not seeing anything about that here, so we have to assume that he wasn't until he came in contact with whatever's in that trailer.
Not much here that'll lead us anywhere.
Well... there's that.
There was no buyer there.
No, no, no.
No!
Please, God, no!
No!
I don't deserve to die!
- No!
No!
- Everyone says that.
No!
No!
No!
Yeah, those chargers are hard to find.
Between "Fast and Furious" and "Dukes of Hazzard,"
they wrecked a lot of them.
My boyfriend wrecked his in a street race.
He's pretty broken up.
I guess he was more attached to it than I thought.
I ain't seen none around here, though.
- Sorry.
- All right.
Thanks, man.
Hey, uh, most of them wrecked movie cars, they're dumped at El Monte Junk and Salvage.
If your boyfriend wants to fix his ride up, might want to go over there and find scraps.
Thanks.
Maybe he'll go there.
Daisy's in Los Angeles.
There was an eyewitness, now dead, and I just received Yo-Yo's check-in report a week early, which means Coulson and Mack are there, too,
- no doubt, trying to track Daisy down.
- Sounds right.
You know it is, because according to the logs, you called Coulson back to H.Q. for resupply yourself.
Why, if not to give him that intel in person, knowing it's against the Director's orders?
I didn't send them.
I don't have the authority.
- They acted on their own.
- You knew I'd find out.
Why not tell me?
I have daily lie detection.
- That's why.
- And now I have to report it, which means now I either look like I'm incompetent
- or colluding with you.
- Wouldn't want you falling out of favor with the director.
Okay.
I get it.
It's abundantly clear you're uncomfortable with my new position...
I just want to know how comfortable you are with it.
You actually trust this guy?
Our team split up to lead departments, given different colors.
'Cause we're experts?
No.
I think the Director broke up the band on purpose.
Of course he did!
As soon as Talbot gave the location of this base to the president, things changed.
I knew we'd be divided, undermined, kept in the dark, so I have been clawing for as much power as I can possibly grab to keep a modicum of control over any of this.
After all we've been through...
I don't trust the new Director, but he trusts me, so now, in order to keep that trust,
I must take the appropriate action to address this break in protocol.
I'm sending you and your strike team to take Coulson and Mack out of the field, by force, if necessary.
Clean up whatever mess he's in.
- That's an order.
- Yes, ma'am.
Place them at the four corners of the exterior of the building.
That'll give us visuals through the walls.
This could be very dangerous.
- So much could go wrong.
- Ultron, yes.
I know.
But this is not A.I. A.I. is banned, and that's good.
This is mimicry of human behavior.
Still, in the wrong hands, this could be used as a weapon.
- Is that the idea?
- No, absolutely not.
No...
Look, I know the dangers.
That's why I've been...
I've been reticent to divulge.
I don't know these new people at S.H.I.E.L.D.
But a weapon is absolutely not the idea.
Well, then, why?
What's she for?
Why not let Aida tell you herself?
Hello.
I'm glad to finally shake your hand, Leopold.
Where's Jemma?
We were hoping that she would come.
S-She's, uh... indisposed, I'm afraid.
Aida...
- I was wondering...
- Yes, Agent Fitz?
I was wondering if you could tell me exactly what it is you are designed for.
Of course.
Dr. Radcliffe, time and again, has expressed his deep regret for causing pain when all he ever wanted was to prevent it.
He speaks often of the pain that you and Agent Simmons have had to suffer, having lost so many friends...
Lincoln Campbell,
Andrew Garner, Antoine Triplett...
Okay, stop it, stop.
You don't have to list them.
Sorry.
The hope is that I will be able to prevent future tragedies... save the lives of agents by putting myself in harm's way in their place.
- To kill?
- No.
I am incapable of that.
I will protect.
I will serve as a decoy target, a safeguard...
- ...a shield.
- Okay.
T-Turn her off.
We can't tell Simmons about this.
What?
Don't we want to move forward?
Her approval is...
This is too dangerous to show the new Director.
We don't know what he'd do with it.
And she would have to tell him, so... she can't know.
- Not until...
- Until...?
Until she's perfect.
They're walking in now, six.
Really convivial-looking fellows.
At least four of them are packing.
We should be tapped into surveillance now.
Let's see what we get.
Where are the other two men?
We had to leave them at the pick-up site.
Explain.
Those guys were transferring the box into the armored transport.
Maybe they peeked inside or something.
But they went berserk and tore into each other.
There was blood everywhere.
We put two bullets in each of them and locked them in the truck.
No, no.
Look, we were freaking out.
We had to get out of there!
Did you burn their bodies or dump the truck in the ocean?
Because if not, they can be traced back here.
They probably saw what was in this box and were fighting over it, you idiot!
I have been told it's powerful enough to bring our new enhanced enemies to their knees.
We get on comms and call the Zephyr for backup, headquarters will know we're on Daisy's trail.
No orders to pull out.
She's been tracking this sale.
- She could show up here any minute.
- I don't know.
Let's let this play out, see if anyone else makes an appearance.
Excuse me.
Uh, the yard's closing.
To sell a junker, you can call the number on the gate.
Oh, no, I'm not here for that.
I, uh...
Uh, sorry.
What's your name?
Robbie.
Well, Robbie, I am looking for a guy with a sweet black '69 Charger.
Maybe he bought some parts here.
Sorry.
Doesn't ring a bell.
I only work nights once a week.
Uh, well, maybe I'll...
I'll come back in the morning.
Thank you.
Or... there's a book of sales you can flip through in the main office.
Not really an office.
More of a trailer, but I can show you.
That would be great, thank you.
The hell...?
What was that?
A breath of fresh air.
Get away from me!
That's it there.
- So, you live around here?
- No, I used to.
I'm just in town for a couple days, soaking up the sun.
Strange place to spend your vacation.
Not a great neighborhood.
So... you've got the devil inside you, too.
What's going on, guys?
Call for backup, yeah?
We can't wait for Daisy.
These guys might kill somebody besides each other.
Yeah.
Us.
Z One, we got a situation.
We need a little help here.
That was efficient.
You guys know what to do.
Damn.
All clear.
You shouldn't have gotten involved.
Serial killers always complain when we try to intervene.
I only kill asesinos who deserve it.
It's vengeance, chica.
For what?
You killed a detective.
But he had blood on his hands.
- A teacher!
- A pedophile.
You don't get to decide who deserves to die.
I'm not the one who decides.
Do it.
I deserve it.
Do it.
Hey.
Thank for the ride, Janet.
You never accept rides.
Bus break down?
Or you still trying to holler at Janet's little sister?
Maybe.
I only needed a ride to help Canelo balance some books because my brother didn't finish high school.
Yo, I finished high school...
in the 11th grade.
"Everyone's attached to something."
- Spent a lot of time in here?
- Too much.
My wallet's starting to get sick of it.
Your little side mission didn't go unnoticed.
Well, you showed up, so, yeah.
The Director will want to have words with you at H.Q.
- No Daisy, huh?
- No.
But she was tracking these guys, so maybe this is a win.
I don't know.
The ground team is checking for contagion, but hopefully, whatever messed with these guys' heads is no longer an issue.
We're gonna analyze the box it came in.
It's good... to have a moment, just us.
It's been a long time since we had a moment alone.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
Just a long day.
Well, take advantage of the down time.
Who knows what tomorrow holds?

Why you telling Allen you can get him shit when you know damn well you can't?

You see, Eric, there's things you know and there's things you don't know, and then there's things you don't even know you don't know.
So that's it?
You got your answer.
Go back to North Texas.

Don't worry about him.

Go where?
You said you have family in Durango, right?

- No, you can't.
This people, own the police.
Listen to me.
Does anyone here know you have family in Durango?
No.
Okay.
Then you have to go back to Durango.
If you stay here, they will find you and your son.
We didn't do anything.
I know.
That's why I'm here.
How long?
How long do we have to hide there?
You can never come back.
I left there to get away from all of this.
I have built a life for my son.
You're wasting time.

I have so many questions.
What do you know about it?
Last time I saw them, they were fine.
Yeah, well, now they're not.
I want you to help me figure out who's gonna pay for that.
What do you know about the Jimenez cartel?
They run half of Texas.
We have the other half.
Why?
Got a text from my brother yesterday.
Okay.
He said someone from the Jimenez cartel threatened him at the hotel bar.
He told you that?
He didn't tell you?
No.
No, he did not, because if he did, I would have warned him.
A threat like that is not a joke.
The guy said to be careful dealing in Texas.
Told him to go home.
Did he say what the guy looked like?
No.
Well, then how does he know it was Jimenez?
I don't know, James, that's just what he said.
Why?
You doubt it?
I don't know what I think, man.
It could be Jimenez.
Do we have problems with them?
Sure.
But maybe it's just some jokers pretending to be Jimenez.
Look, let me call my boss.
We need to figure things out.
There was a maid.
Might be able to identify somebody.
You know about that?
How'd you hear about that?
I heard about it.
I'll check on the maid too.
But look, it's not gonna be easy.
There's a lot of heat on this.
I'll give you a beat, then I take things into my own hands.
You won't have to.
I promise.
We'll figure this out.
No, I'm telling you.
That's how much you're supposed to pay.
No, that's the bill.
I don't owe you $500.
Hey, can I help you?
Hey, yeah, I'm looking for Maria Sanchez.
Have you seen her around today?

They're dead, do you hear me?
They're all dead.
They're all dead!
What?
James, you don't know this?
Is that what you're telling me?
Look, Leon, you just woke me up, man.
You're coming at me with shit I can't digest.
Just back up a sec.
My brothers got hit, do you understand me?
They're gone, James.
They're dead.
All right, listen to me.
This has nothing to do with me or the people I work for.
We met, I got the dope, they got the cash, end of story.
Uh-huh, not end of story, James.
This is a mess.
Turn on the damn news.
All right.
Look, Leon, let me make some calls.
I'll get back to you as soon as I got something, okay?
I'm on a plane.
When I land, I want answers.
Seems like they got a brother.
He's flying in.
He's on his way.
It sounds like trouble.
I'll think of something.
One bird at a time.
Find that maid.
How is he?
It's a wait-and-see thing.
What, you want to take a chance and drop him off at emergency?
You know we can't do that.
Then it's a wait-and-see thing.
He's stable.
You should get some sleep.
I want you to understand,
I know what you're going through.
I don't want anything to happen to that woman.
At this point, that's not your decision to make.
Hurry up, mi'jo.
You got everything?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
Hello?
Brenda, it's me.
I'm in trouble, okay?
I need your help.
Teresita, what's wrong?
I just need your help, okay?
Okay.
What's happening?
It's early.
Camila.
You had me a little nervous there.
We're actually a bit late.
Usual drop time is 2:00, right?
Yeah.
I wanted to deliver it personally.
I thought you were dry.
And I thought you were listening.
I told you it was a temporary thing.
Consider everything back to normal.
100 total.
You got the door?
Holy shit, that's nice.
That's really nice.
So, uh, so you're back.
I never left.
Was just a rumor.
There's just one problem.
Oh, yeah?
And what is that?
What's the matter?
Not who you expected?
Don't you belong in North Texas?
You don't belong here.
Person can get in trouble in my territory.
I know you're not authorized to take me out.
You're not.
I mean, even you're smarter than that.
What are you doing here?
What's in the bag?
Just a little something to help out a friend.
He doesn't want your help.
Allen.
Yo!
Allen.
Get your ass out here.
Camila just told me you don't want my coke.
I told you, it was just temporary.
Why you telling Allen you can get him shit when you know damn well you can't?
She just delivered.
Look at your little birdbrain doing these little birdbrain calculations.
You see, Eric, there's things you know and there's things you don't know, and then there's things you don't even know you don't know.
So that's it?
You got your answer.
Go back to North Texas.
I'll see you around, Allen.
You're betting on the wrong horse.
Don't worry about him.
He gives you trouble, just call me.
Denny.
Name's Maria Sanchez.
That's her home address.
Listen, you really took a dump on this, you know that?
We're getting way too much attention.
I know.
Four dead bodies.
Department's buzzing.
The deal was, you're not supposed to make us look bad.
Let's call it rare occurrence.
I appreciate the favor.
So does Camila.
Yeah.
Yo, James.
It's Leon.
Just landed.
Want to see you.
Yeah, I'm thinking the same.
Where you at?
No!
No!
No!
I say nothing, I say nothing.
I say nothing.
I no hurt you, okay?
I'm here to help you.
Listen to me.
I'm not here to hurt you, okay?
There are people coming for you.
Mom, who is she?
What do I do?
We are not like them.
Let her go.
Let her go, Angel.
Let her go.
Why are you here?
What do you want?
There are people coming for you, okay?
I tell the police nothing.
I say nothing.
I believe you, okay?
But all these people care about is that you're not a threat to them.
You're a witness.
You saw my face.
But I want to help you.
We cannot waste time.
Listen to me, they're on their way.
We have to go.
Go where?
You said you have family in Durango, right?
Are they still there?
My father, my uncle.
- We are going to the police.
- No, you can't.
This people, own the police.
Listen to me.
Does anyone here know you have family in Durango?
No.
Okay.
Then you have to go back to Durango.
If you stay here, they will find you and your son.
We didn't do anything.
I know.
That's why I'm here.
How long?
How long do we have to hide there?
You can never come back.
I left there to get away from all of this.
I have built a life for my son.
You're wasting time.
I'm sorry to hear about what happened.
Me too.
Me too.
I'm sure you could imagine.
Yeah.
So let's talk about my brothers.
I have so many questions.
What do you know about it?
Last time I saw them, they were fine.
Yeah, well, now they're not.
I want you to help me figure out who's gonna pay for that.
What do you know about the Jimenez cartel?
They run half of Texas.
We have the other half.
Why?
Got a text from my brother yesterday.
Okay.
He said someone from the Jimenez cartel threatened him at the hotel bar.
He told you that?
He didn't tell you?
No.
No, he did not, because if he did, I would have warned him.
A threat like that is not a joke.
The guy said to be careful dealing in Texas.
Told him to go home.
Did he say what the guy looked like?
No.
Well, then how does he know it was Jimenez?
I don't know, James, that's just what he said.
Why?
You doubt it?
I don't know what I think, man.
It could be Jimenez.
Do we have problems with them?
Sure.
But maybe it's just some jokers pretending to be Jimenez.
Look, let me call my boss.
We need to figure things out.
There was a maid.
Might be able to identify somebody.
You know about that?
How'd you hear about that?
I heard about it.
I'll check on the maid too.
But look, it's not gonna be easy.
There's a lot of heat on this.
I'll give you a beat, then I take things into my own hands.
You won't have to.
I promise.
We'll figure this out.
No, I'm telling you.
That's how much you're supposed to pay.
No, that's the bill.
I don't owe you $500.
Hey, can I help you?
Hey, yeah, I'm looking for Maria Sanchez.
Have you seen her around today?
I'm a friend of hers from work.
She's not here.
Look, she didn't show up to work.
We're just worried.
You know when she's gonna be back?
She mentioned she's running errands.
Maybe a couple hours.
All right, thank you.
Jesus.
Come on, Annabelle.
Come on.
Hey.
Is that your cat?
She is now.
Maria gave her to me before she left.
She's mine now.
When did she leave?
Mm-mm-mm.
Where'd she go?
I don't know.
I swear to God.
You lied to the cops.
You don't lie to me.
You understand?
She and Angel left with some woman.
Policewoman?
I...
I don't know.
What did she look like?
Uh, she was... dark hair, pretty.
That's all I remember.
Maybe the cameras will remember more.
She left with them.
Where'd they go?
I don't know.
I swear I don't.
Hey, what's up?
Is Teresa there?
I don't know.
I'm with Tonto.
Go look.
Sure.
I don't see her.
She's not inside.
Check her car.
Quickly.
Sure.
She's gone.
Turn on the LoJack.
Now.
Yeah.
Sure.
Do you have money?
I don't want your money.
You should see it on the screen any second now.
I got her.
Camila.
Jaime.
So nice to see you again.
It's all here.
Everything I owe you.
You know, Camila, I have to be honest with you.
I didn't think that you were going to be able to make your payment.
See, Jaime, all my life, men have underestimated me.
I've grown used to it.
See, most men are very basic creatures.
They can't seem to see beyond my legs.
So sometimes I use that to my advantage and others, I just depend upon it.
Anyway, now that my debt is settled
I assume our mutual trust is restored?
And most important, my credit, separate from Epifanio's.
Absolutely.
And you're forgiven for being late on your payment.
Good.
And you're forgiven for letting my husband know about our arrangement and trying to undermine my business.
You see, I know everything.
I know he's the one's that's been putting the works on me all this time.
I know he's the one that arranged the shipment from you to be busted, putting me in this mess.
Just as I know he empowered Eric and the Jimenez cartel to put a move on me.
So I know everything.
It's okay.
You can speak freely.
Who told you?
I had my suspicions.
Call it an instinct.
And you just confirmed it.
I'm not angry, Jaime.
I understand this wasn't personal.
I know that your business with Epifanio is more valuable than mine.
But not for long.
I'm going to increase my business, so starting next month,
I want to double my shipment from you.
We have no objection to that, of course.
But we know that Epifanio keeps a tight rein on things in Texas.
He might object.
No, he won't.
How can you be so sure?
He won't have a choice.
James.
Where are we with the maid?
I'm still waiting on Denny.
Should be soon, though.
But this Leon guy, the brother?
This gold-tooth bastard?
He's trouble.
You know, even if we take care of the maid,
I'm telling you, this guy's not gonna stop until he's got blood on his hands.
Tell him I want to meet with him.
You want to meet with him?
Why?
Just set up a meet.
I have an idea.
Just make sure to find that maid.
May I help you?
Is Father Ramon here?
Yes, he's counseling a parishioner.
Can you tell him Teresa Mendoza is here?
Uh, yes, sure.
I will let him know.
Thank you.
Teresa.
Are you okay?
No, I need the tunnel.
I need to get these people back to Mexico.
I bring good people over, not back.
I don't know them.
I hardly know you.
How can I be sure I can trust you?
You can't, but if you don't, this woman and her son will be dead.
I don't have any vans leaving until the weekend.
I don't need a ride.
I just need directions.
Leon.
Camila Vargas.
I'm sorry for your loss.
Did you find anything out?
I assume you know who I am?
Who my husband is?
You know our names, our reputations are of the utmost importance.
So when you come into my town and accuse my men of having something to do with this, this is why you're here in front of me.
No.
I'm here because your man made a deal with my brothers, and now they're dead.
Although he said he had nothing to do with it,
I can make a lot of problems for you while I'm here looking for who did.
You're smarter than you look.
Just give me some answers.
I'll be out of your hair.
You're talking about going after a cartel.
I don't care about the cartel.
I'm not after their territory.
I'm after the men who killed my brothers.
You sure you want to go down this road?
You do understand that if you attack a cartel, it just won't go away.
We have swamps down there for people who come looking.
What's his name?
I can give you the man that engineered this hit.
But you didn't hear it from me.
You see, I have an agreement with the Jimenez people, and I'll be violating my accord if I put a move on this man.
Lucky for you, then, I don't have an accord.
His name is Eric Watson.
They call him the Birdman.
And this is where you can find him.
Are you sure?
Took a lot of work to find that out, but nothing happens here without me eventually knowing about it.
So do it quickly, and then... get out of my city.
Oh, shit.
I don't believe this.
Take the next right.
We've got a problem.
It's okay.
You seem surprised to see me, Camila.
What's the matter?
Not who you were expecting?
What are you doing here, Eric?
Well, if you're gonna send a dog to do your dirty work, it needs bigger teeth.
That Leon, that was one tough Everglade bitch, and it wasn't until...
This one that he let me know it was you who sent him.
I mean, at least I know where you got your coke for...
for Allen, huh?
I mean, look at you, just flopping around in the mud, trying to stay afloat... whatever the cost.
I'm really starting to enjoy this shit between us.
You got spirit.
_
I'll be right back.
You turned your phone tracker off.
That's right.
You knew about the LoJack so you got the car towed.
That's smart.
And now you're being very stupid, Teresa.
Look, I know you got the maid.
So bring her back to me and we can forget this ever happened.
I'm not gonna be responsible for what you want me to do.
Teresa, look, Camila doesn't know about this.
I haven't told her yet.
She doesn't have to know.
But I need you to bring the maid back.
She won't say anything.
You have to trust me.
Look, I'm trying to stop you from making a big mistake here.
Wherever you think you're going, whatever you think you're doing,
Camila will find you.
We can keep this between us.
I need you to come back.
No.
It's okay.
They don't know where we are.
God will forgive you for what you did to us, but I won't.
It's okay.
You did what you could.
I need to go with them.
No, you don't need to go...
- I need to go with them.
- No.
Listen to me.
I need to go back to Mexico to get what I told you can save our lives.
We have no choice.
Everyone seems to be messing with my business.
We're late with everyone.
No one has their shipments.
- Teresa.
- Yeah, hi.
When you first came into our church, you mentioned you needed to get back to Mexico to retrieve something of value.
I might be able to get you there.
You're making a mistake, Allen.
It's one time.
You are my supplier, not Eric.
Get me my money or I'm cutting you off.
You have proven you can be relied upon to do what I need.
Turning to $2 1/2 million into five.
It's not an easy trick.
Just do what I say and nothing will happen to you.
I know you're scared.
You don't know how dead you are.
Stop talking.
He's not gonna kill you.
I'm not gonna kill you.
Use that fear to stay alive.
You're a survivor.
Is he dead?
Yeah.
She's all messed up.
Stay with me, man.
Stay with me.
How's he doing?
He's not good, man.
Where's the doctor?
Not here yet.
I can see that, genius.
Camila says he's on his way.
I gave him some water anyways.
Go get some clean towels and some alcohol.
Go back to your business!
Can't believe it.
Get his feet.
Keep his legs up.
Keep his legs up.
Give me your hand.
Lay back.
Talk.
Hey!
Hey!
Wake up.
Don't you fall asleep, okay?
You understand?
Where the hell's the doctor?
He's five minutes away.
I hope we have five minutes.
This thing is all over the news.
How exposed are we?
A maid saw Teresa's face at the hotel.
She can ID her.
Where's Teresa?
I don't know.
I think in the back.
It's okay.
I know how hard this was for you.
I know.
But do you really think you could have gotten out of that hotel room without doing what you did?
No.
So it's not like you had a choice, right?
That cabrón was going to kill you.
And he wouldn't have blinked or shed a tear.
Life is for the living.
Now pull yourself together.
We still have work to do.
Three people are dead following a shootout and a horrific accident on Interstate 30 today.
The incident may have involved rival gangs and drug cartels.
Give me the info you got on the maid.
The maid in the room.
She won't say anything.
She was scared.
This isn't a robbery anymore, Teresa.
It's a murder investigation.
The cops, they tend to lose their sense of humor at this point.
We can't be tied to this.
She's the only one who saw your face.
I didn't get her name.
I specifically said take a picture of her ID.
She was scared.
I threatened her.
- So you didn't get it.
- I didn't get her name.
Why?
That's the first thing I told you.
I threatened her.
She was scared.
I didn't get her name.
Enough.
You know what's done is done.
Call Denny at the sheriff's office.
He'll track her address for us.
That's what he's paid for.
Doctor's here.
Denny, it's me.
I know it.
I know, it's a shitstorm.
Look, there's a maid who's a witness.
Is she saying anything?
Well, I wish she didn't say anything, but it's the way it is.
I need her address.
It's not coming from me.
It's Camila.
So don't say shit about it.
Just get it done.
How long ago was he shot?
Coming up on 40 minutes.
All right.
Get his legs down flat.
Don't elevate the legs.
Not with a torso wound.
Okay, we're gonna have to turn him over.
- Check for exit wounds.
- Okay.
All right, move the towels out of the way.
Get ready to roll him over.
Everybody ready.
On three.
Ready?
One, two, three.
Easy.
One, two...
There's no third exit wound.
What does that mean?
It means the third bullet's still in here.
We need to lay him back down.
Come on, come on, easy.
Shit.
Hey!
We need a hand over here.
You!
Come on.
Come on.
Get me the scanner from my bag.
The black thing with the hook.
Come on.
Black thing.
That.
Right there.
Bring it here.
Thanks.
Grab his legs.
Hold him in place.
Watch his head.
Hold him down.
Easy.
Somebody from Florida's blowing up my phone.
I don't know what to do.
Deal with it.
- No.
- Why not?
'Cause I don't know what to say.
I don't know who it is.
They must know something.
Avoiding it is just gonna make you more suspicious.
Answer the phone.
Say you don't know anything about what happened.
Do it.
Yeah?
- Is this James?
- Who's this?
Leon Terris.
Got your number from Beto.
Yeah, Beto's my boy.
What's up?
Beto says you're the dude who set up the meeting with my brothers,
John and Reggie.
Yeah.
What's going on?
What's going on?
My brothers got smoked, James.
They got smoked!
What the hell are you talking about?
They're dead, do you hear me?
They're all dead.
They're all dead!
What?
James, you don't know this?
Is that what you're telling me?
Look, Leon, you just woke me up, man.
You're coming at me with shit I can't digest.
Just back up a sec.
My brothers got hit, do you understand me?
They're gone, James.
They're dead.
All right, listen to me.
This has nothing to do with me or the people I work for.

So that's it?
You got your answer.
Go back to North Texas.
I'll see you around, Allen.
You're betting on the wrong horse.
Don't worry about him.
He gives you trouble, just call me.
Denny.
Name's Maria Sanchez.
That's her home address.
Listen, you really took a dump on this, you know that?

Where'd she go?
I don't know.
I swear to God.
You lied to the cops.
You don't lie to me.
You understand?
She and Angel left with some woman.
Policewoman?
I...
I don't know.
What did she look like?
Uh, she was... dark hair, pretty.
That's all I remember.
Maybe the cameras will remember more.
She left with them.
Where'd they go?
I don't know.
I swear I don't.
Hey, what's up?
Is Teresa there?
I don't know.
I'm with Tonto.
Go look.
Sure.
I don't see her.
She's not inside.
Check her car.
Quickly.
Sure.
She's gone.
Turn on the LoJack.
Now.
Yeah.
Sure.
Do you have money?
I don't want your money.
You should see it on the screen any second now.
I got her.
Camila.
Jaime.
So nice to see you again.
It's all here.
Everything I owe you.
You know, Camila, I have to be honest with you.
I didn't think that you were going to be able to make your payment.
See, Jaime, all my life, men have underestimated me.
I've grown used to it.
See, most men are very basic creatures.
They can't seem to see beyond my legs.
So sometimes I use that to my advantage and others, I just depend upon it.
Anyway, now that my debt is settled
I assume our mutual trust is restored?
And most important, my credit, separate from Epifanio's.
Absolutely.
And you're forgiven for being late on your payment.
Good.
And you're forgiven for letting my husband know about our arrangement and trying to undermine my business.
You see, I know everything.
I know he's the one's that's been putting the works on me all this time.
I know he's the one that arranged the shipment from you to be busted, putting me in this mess.
Just as I know he empowered Eric and the Jimenez cartel to put a move on me.
So I know everything.
It's okay.
You can speak freely.
Who told you?
I had my suspicions.
Call it an instinct.
And you just confirmed it.
I'm not angry, Jaime.
I understand this wasn't personal.
I know that your business with Epifanio is more valuable than mine.
But not for long.
I'm going to increase my business, so starting next month,
I want to double my shipment from you.
We have no objection to that, of course.
But we know that Epifanio keeps a tight rein on things in Texas.
He might object.
No, he won't.
How can you be so sure?
He won't have a choice.
James.
Where are we with the maid?
I'm still waiting on Denny.
Should be soon, though.
But this Leon guy, the brother?
This gold-tooth bastard?
He's trouble.
You know, even if we take care of the maid,
I'm telling you, this guy's not gonna stop until he's got blood on his hands.
Tell him I want to meet with him.
You want to meet with him?
Why?
Just set up a meet.
I have an idea.
Just make sure to find that maid.
May I help you?
Is Father Ramon here?
Yes, he's counseling a parishioner.
Can you tell him Teresa Mendoza is here?
Uh, yes, sure.
I will let him know.
Thank you.
Teresa.
Are you okay?
No, I need the tunnel.
I need to get these people back to Mexico.
I bring good people over, not back.
I don't know them.
I hardly know you.
How can I be sure I can trust you?
You can't, but if you don't, this woman and her son will be dead.
I don't have any vans leaving until the weekend.
I don't need a ride.
I just need directions.
Leon.
Camila Vargas.
I'm sorry for your loss.
Did you find anything out?
I assume you know who I am?
Who my husband is?
You know our names, our reputations are of the utmost importance.
So when you come into my town and accuse my men of having something to do with this, this is why you're here in front of me.
No.
I'm here because your man made a deal with my brothers, and now they're dead.
Although he said he had nothing to do with it,
I can make a lot of problems for you while I'm here looking for who did.
You're smarter than you look.
Just give me some answers.
I'll be out of your hair.
You're talking about going after a cartel.
I don't care about the cartel.
I'm not after their territory.
I'm after the men who killed my brothers.
You sure you want to go down this road?
You do understand that if you attack a cartel, it just won't go away.
We have swamps down there for people who come looking.
What's his name?
I can give you the man that engineered this hit.
But you didn't hear it from me.
You see, I have an agreement with the Jimenez people, and I'll be violating my accord if I put a move on this man.
Lucky for you, then, I don't have an accord.
His name is Eric Watson.
They call him the Birdman.
And this is where you can find him.
Are you sure?
Took a lot of work to find that out, but nothing happens here without me eventually knowing about it.
So do it quickly, and then... get out of my city.
Oh, shit.
I don't believe this.
Take the next right.
We've got a problem.
It's okay.
You seem surprised to see me, Camila.
What's the matter?
Not who you were expecting?
What are you doing here, Eric?
Well, if you're gonna send a dog to do your dirty work, it needs bigger teeth.
That Leon, that was one tough Everglade bitch, and it wasn't until...
This one that he let me know it was you who sent him.
I mean, at least I know where you got your coke for...
for Allen, huh?
I mean, look at you, just flopping around in the mud, trying to stay afloat... whatever the cost.
I'm really starting to enjoy this shit between us.
You got spirit.
_
I'll be right back.
You turned your phone tracker off.
That's right.
You knew about the LoJack so you got the car towed.
That's smart.
And now you're being very stupid, Teresa.
Look, I know you got the maid.
So bring her back to me and we can forget this ever happened.
I'm not gonna be responsible for what you want me to do.
Teresa, look, Camila doesn't know about this.
I haven't told her yet.
She doesn't have to know.
But I need you to bring the maid back.
She won't say anything.
You have to trust me.
Look, I'm trying to stop you from making a big mistake here.
Wherever you think you're going, whatever you think you're doing,
Camila will find you.
We can keep this between us.
I need you to come back.
No.
It's okay.
They don't know where we are.
God will forgive you for what you did to us, but I won't.
It's okay.
You did what you could.
I need to go with them.
No, you don't need to go...
- I need to go with them.
- No.
Listen to me.
I need to go back to Mexico to get what I told you can save our lives.
We have no choice.
Everyone seems to be messing with my business.
We're late with everyone.
No one has their shipments.
- Teresa.
- Yeah, hi.
When you first came into our church, you mentioned you needed to get back to Mexico to retrieve something of value.
I might be able to get you there.
You're making a mistake, Allen.
It's one time.
You are my supplier, not Eric.
Get me my money or I'm cutting you off.
You have proven you can be relied upon to do what I need.
Turning to $2 1/2 million into five.
It's not an easy trick.
Just do what I say and nothing will happen to you.
I know you're scared.
You don't know how dead you are.
Stop talking.
He's not gonna kill you.
I'm not gonna kill you.
Use that fear to stay alive.
You're a survivor.
Is he dead?
Yeah.
She's all messed up.
Stay with me, man.
Stay with me.
How's he doing?
He's not good, man.
Where's the doctor?
Not here yet.
I can see that, genius.
Camila says he's on his way.
I gave him some water anyways.
Go get some clean towels and some alcohol.
Go back to your business!
Can't believe it.
Get his feet.
Keep his legs up.
Keep his legs up.
Give me your hand.
Lay back.
Talk.
Hey!
Hey!
Wake up.
Don't you fall asleep, okay?
You understand?
Where the hell's the doctor?
He's five minutes away.
I hope we have five minutes.
This thing is all over the news.
How exposed are we?
A maid saw Teresa's face at the hotel.
She can ID her.
Where's Teresa?
I don't know.
I think in the back.
It's okay.
I know how hard this was for you.
I know.
But do you really think you could have gotten out of that hotel room without doing what you did?
No.
So it's not like you had a choice, right?
That cabrón was going to kill you.
And he wouldn't have blinked or shed a tear.
Life is for the living.
Now pull yourself together.
We still have work to do.
Three people are dead following a shootout and a horrific accident on Interstate 30 today.
The incident may have involved rival gangs and drug cartels.
Give me the info you got on the maid.
The maid in the room.
She won't say anything.
She was scared.
This isn't a robbery anymore, Teresa.
It's a murder investigation.
The cops, they tend to lose their sense of humor at this point.
We can't be tied to this.
She's the only one who saw your face.
I didn't get her name.
I specifically said take a picture of her ID.
She was scared.
I threatened her.
- So you didn't get it.
- I didn't get her name.
Why?
That's the first thing I told you.
I threatened her.
She was scared.
I didn't get her name.
Enough.
You know what's done is done.
Call Denny at the sheriff's office.
He'll track her address for us.
That's what he's paid for.
Doctor's here.
Denny, it's me.
I know it.
I know, it's a shitstorm.
Look, there's a maid who's a witness.
Is she saying anything?
Well, I wish she didn't say anything, but it's the way it is.
I need her address.
It's not coming from me.
It's Camila.
So don't say shit about it.
Just get it done.
How long ago was he shot?
Coming up on 40 minutes.
All right.
Get his legs down flat.
Don't elevate the legs.
Not with a torso wound.
Okay, we're gonna have to turn him over.
- Check for exit wounds.
- Okay.
All right, move the towels out of the way.
Get ready to roll him over.
Everybody ready.
On three.
Ready?
One, two, three.
Easy.
One, two...
There's no third exit wound.
What does that mean?
It means the third bullet's still in here.
We need to lay him back down.
Come on, come on, easy.
Shit.
Hey!
We need a hand over here.
You!
Come on.
Come on.
Get me the scanner from my bag.
The black thing with the hook.
Come on.
Black thing.
That.
Right there.
Bring it here.
Thanks.
Grab his legs.
Hold him in place.
Watch his head.
Hold him down.
Easy.
Somebody from Florida's blowing up my phone.
I don't know what to do.
Deal with it.
- No.
- Why not?
'Cause I don't know what to say.
I don't know who it is.
They must know something.
Avoiding it is just gonna make you more suspicious.
Answer the phone.
Say you don't know anything about what happened.
Do it.
Yeah?
- Is this James?
- Who's this?
Leon Terris.
Got your number from Beto.
Yeah, Beto's my boy.
What's up?
Beto says you're the dude who set up the meeting with my brothers,
John and Reggie.
Yeah.
What's going on?
What's going on?
My brothers got smoked, James.
They got smoked!
What the hell are you talking about?
They're dead, do you hear me?
They're all dead.
They're all dead!
What?
James, you don't know this?
Is that what you're telling me?
Look, Leon, you just woke me up, man.
You're coming at me with shit I can't digest.
Just back up a sec.
My brothers got hit, do you understand me?
They're gone, James.
They're dead.
All right, listen to me.
This has nothing to do with me or the people I work for.
We met, I got the dope, they got the cash, end of story.
Uh-huh, not end of story, James.
This is a mess.
Turn on the damn news.
All right.
Look, Leon, let me make some calls.
I'll get back to you as soon as I got something, okay?
I'm on a plane.
When I land, I want answers.
Seems like they got a brother.
He's flying in.
He's on his way.
It sounds like trouble.
I'll think of something.
One bird at a time.
Find that maid.
How is he?
It's a wait-and-see thing.
What, you want to take a chance and drop him off at emergency?
You know we can't do that.
Then it's a wait-and-see thing.
He's stable.
You should get some sleep.
I want you to understand,
I know what you're going through.
I don't want anything to happen to that woman.
At this point, that's not your decision to make.
Hurry up, mi'jo.
You got everything?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
Hello?
Brenda, it's me.
I'm in trouble, okay?
I need your help.
Teresita, what's wrong?
I just need your help, okay?
Okay.
What's happening?
It's early.
Camila.
You had me a little nervous there.
We're actually a bit late.
Usual drop time is 2:00, right?
Yeah.
I wanted to deliver it personally.
I thought you were dry.
And I thought you were listening.
I told you it was a temporary thing.
Consider everything back to normal.
100 total.
You got the door?
Holy shit, that's nice.
That's really nice.
So, uh, so you're back.
I never left.
Was just a rumor.
There's just one problem.
Oh, yeah?
And what is that?
What's the matter?
Not who you expected?
Don't you belong in North Texas?
You don't belong here.
Person can get in trouble in my territory.
I know you're not authorized to take me out.
You're not.
I mean, even you're smarter than that.
What are you doing here?
What's in the bag?
Just a little something to help out a friend.
He doesn't want your help.
Allen.
Yo!
Allen.
Get your ass out here.
Camila just told me you don't want my coke.
I told you, it was just temporary.
Why you telling Allen you can get him shit when you know damn well you can't?
She just delivered.
Look at your little birdbrain doing these little birdbrain calculations.
You see, Eric, there's things you know and there's things you don't know, and then there's things you don't even know you don't know.
So that's it?
You got your answer.
Go back to North Texas.
I'll see you around, Allen.
You're betting on the wrong horse.
Don't worry about him.
He gives you trouble, just call me.
Denny.
Name's Maria Sanchez.
That's her home address.
Listen, you really took a dump on this, you know that?
We're getting way too much attention.
I know.
Four dead bodies.
Department's buzzing.
The deal was, you're not supposed to make us look bad.
Let's call it rare occurrence.
I appreciate the favor.
So does Camila.
Yeah.
Yo, James.
It's Leon.
Just landed.
Want to see you.
Yeah, I'm thinking the same.
Where you at?
No!
No!
No!
I say nothing, I say nothing.
I say nothing.
I no hurt you, okay?
I'm here to help you.
Listen to me.
I'm not here to hurt you, okay?
There are people coming for you.
Mom, who is she?
What do I do?
We are not like them.
Let her go.
Let her go, Angel.
Let her go.
Why are you here?
What do you want?
There are people coming for you, okay?
I tell the police nothing.
I say nothing.
I believe you, okay?
But all these people care about is that you're not a threat to them.
You're a witness.
You saw my face.
But I want to help you.
We cannot waste time.
Listen to me, they're on their way.
We have to go.
Go where?
You said you have family in Durango, right?
Are they still there?
My father, my uncle.
- We are going to the police.
- No, you can't.
This people, own the police.
Listen to me.
Does anyone here know you have family in Durango?
No.
Okay.
Then you have to go back to Durango.
If you stay here, they will find you and your son.
We didn't do anything.
I know.
That's why I'm here.
How long?
How long do we have to hide there?
You can never come back.
I left there to get away from all of this.
I have built a life for my son.
You're wasting time.
I'm sorry to hear about what happened.
Me too.
Me too.
I'm sure you could imagine.
Yeah.
So let's talk about my brothers.
I have so many questions.
What do you know about it?
Last time I saw them, they were fine.
Yeah, well, now they're not.
I want you to help me figure out who's gonna pay for that.
What do you know about the Jimenez cartel?
They run half of Texas.
We have the other half.
Why?
Got a text from my brother yesterday.
Okay.
He said someone from the Jimenez cartel threatened him at the hotel bar.
He told you that?
He didn't tell you?
No.
No, he did not, because if he did, I would have warned him.
A threat like that is not a joke.
The guy said to be careful dealing in Texas.
Told him to go home.
Did he say what the guy looked like?
No.
Well, then how does he know it was Jimenez?
I don't know, James, that's just what he said.
Why?
You doubt it?
I don't know what I think, man.
It could be Jimenez.
Do we have problems with them?
Sure.
But maybe it's just some jokers pretending to be Jimenez.
Look, let me call my boss.
We need to figure things out.
There was a maid.
Might be able to identify somebody.
You know about that?
How'd you hear about that?
I heard about it.
I'll check on the maid too.
But look, it's not gonna be easy.
There's a lot of heat on this.
I'll give you a beat, then I take things into my own hands.
You won't have to.
I promise.
We'll figure this out.
No, I'm telling you.
That's how much you're supposed to pay.
No, that's the bill.
I don't owe you $500.
Hey, can I help you?
Hey, yeah, I'm looking for Maria Sanchez.
Have you seen her around today?
I'm a friend of hers from work.
She's not here.
Look, she didn't show up to work.
We're just worried.
You know when she's gonna be back?
She mentioned she's running errands.
Maybe a couple hours.
All right, thank you.
Jesus.
Come on, Annabelle.
Come on.
Hey.
Is that your cat?
She is now.
Maria gave her to me before she left.
She's mine now.
When did she leave?
Mm-mm-mm.
Where'd she go?
I don't know.
I swear to God.
You lied to the cops.
You don't lie to me.
You understand?
She and Angel left with some woman.
Policewoman?
I...
I don't know.
What did she look like?
Uh, she was... dark hair, pretty.

- No.
Listen to me.
I need to go back to Mexico to get what I told you can save our lives.
We have no choice.
Previously on Powers...
Why are you doing this?
Funny, that's what momma said every time you threw her against the door.
That's Calista.
She's a Power, all right.
But... she isn't right in the head.
Mr. Secor, can you give us anything that would help track her down?
Senator Bailey Brown, also known as the Cobalt Knight, was found murdered in his Los Angeles office this morning, head crushed.
I know who killed the Knight.
Who?
It was him.
Morrison.
You might know him better as The Ghost.
He killed Senator Brown, and he's gonna kill me next.
So you found him, huh?
The Ghost?
I got to start closing that door.
Yes and no.
What's that supposed to mean?
Christ, can can you give me a second?
What'd you find out?
Well, there, there isn't that much to go on, but what there is has him dead in '67.
Morrison is not dead.
According to every written word on the matter, yes he is.
And you killed him.
You said so yourself at a press conference.
I got it wrong.
What?
Patrick, Morrison hasn't been seen in over 50 years.
What makes you think he'd come back?
He likes the long game.
Hell, he invented it.
Janice's murder brought him out.
He saw a weakness in the Unity, and...
No.
Now, Unity hasn't been "Unity" in a long time.
He hasn't stopped killing.
He's gone, Patrick, okay?
I'm the target.
I always have been.
People don't just come back from the dead.
You sure about that?
Have you seen my...
I think I've seen your everything.
How 'bout you drive me to work so I can keep it going?
You know we are not driving in to work together.
Why are we still doing this?
What's so funny?
Don't do that.
Do what?
Try to turn this into something serious.
Deena, I just...
I'll drive us into work.
No, Kutter, please, do not fuck this up.
Being together fucks this up.
No, there is a time and a place, but work ain't it.
Driving isn't working.
What...
What...
What are you doing?
Carpooling, what are you doing?
Defining boundaries.
Fuck.
Consider them defined.
Don't...
Okay.
Let's say, hypothetically, that you're right, that Morrison's alive.
Why does he... kill Senator Brown now?
Well, that's kind of like asking why a scorpion stings.
Because it's in his nature.
No, because the bastard's an evil fuck, a provocateur.
Morrison's a Level Ten, according to the apes and the way they categorize everything.
He can do whatever the fuck he wants whenever the fuck he wants to do it.
Like survive a combined onslaught from Unity?
Come on.
Even Janice said he was dead.
No, she lied.
And so did I.
We beat him up pretty good, but couldn't find a body, so... she wanted to make a statement to the press to make people feel safe.
I don't remember Janice lying about anything, ever.
Well, maybe you didn't know her as well as you thought you did.
I need to take this to Powers Division.
No.
Yes.
I can't do this on my own.
God damn it, Diamond, it's between the Powers, not... not them.
I'm not a Power.
Once a Power, always a Power, as far as I'm concerned.
Okay.
Let me take a look at some of these leads.
You know, maybe there's a way we...

It helps the mind focus.

Really, I'm good, man.
You... you need you need to have some more.

Drink it, please.
Okay.
Okay, I'm done.
I...
I got to get back.
Thank you.
Thank you for taking care of me, Patrick, but I I got to go.
I...
I can't move my legs.
That's a side effect.
I can't feel my fucking legs, Patrick.
Just get some rest, Diamond, you'll be fine by the morning.
In the morning?
Yeah, give or take.
Lay down.
Mili Pavle.
Zasto uze tebe...
Gentlemen, you seen Walker today?
Clay, you seen Walker?
Yeah, I understand.
We'll get it down there as soon as possible.
Tell him she's on her way.
Yeah, lie to him.
Tell him she's... putting out a fire in India or something and she's running late.
All right.
Call me if things change.
What is happening?
Calista Secor's father came to town to hold up a bank and take hostages.
You and Walker, find Calista.
See if we can't talk him out of doing this before he does something we'll all regret.
I...
I can't find Walker, no one's seen him this morning.
Is he just being Walker or is this something else?
Given recent events, and his headache thing,
I'd like to check his apartment.
Yeah.
Go.
The Secor thing, you...
I got it.
And take Kutter.
I'm good, really.
Take him.
Come with me.
I'm busy.
I need you with me.
Kutter, what are you waiting for?
Go after her!
Now!
The fuck is going on?
For security reasons, after a silent alarm was tripped, indicating a robbery in progress.
Almost two dozen people are being held hostage at a Wilshire Boulevard bank.
The gunman has not made his demands known yet, but LAPD confirms that he is wearing a vest rigged with explosives.
What's wrong with people?
We should suit up and get down there.
Oh, my God.
Police have not release the identity of the bomber, but this security camera image appears to be a match for convicted felon Todd Secor.
- We will bring you up to date...
- That's my Dad.
Best keep it down.
I mean, I'd hate to rile the others.
Oh, my God.
Relax, pretty boy.
You still got your looks.
Do you want to give that guy a heart attack?
Don't worry.
He can't see me.
But he can see you.
What's happening?
The dawn of your brave new world, I think.
How do you feel?
Not dead!
You don't look dead.
You do.
You know what the weird thing is?
I feel fucking fabulous.
Now, let's get out of here.
See how the world treats you.
Or... how you... want to treat the world,
Mr. Back From The Dead.
Walker.
Walker!
Walker.
You want to help or...
He's probably drunk.
Break down the door.
You break down the door.
He could be in trouble in there.
Walker?
Armed police officers on the premises.
If anyone is here, show yourself, now!
Place is empty.
Surprise, surprise.
What's that?
Research.
We got to get this place locked down, processed.
Crime scene?
I don't know yet.
Who's Morrison?
And what is he doing?
Chasing a ghost.
UNITY DECLARES THE GHOST IS DEAD
All I've ever really wanted was a simple life.
I wanted to be a farmer, just like my father before me and his father before him.
I loved the smell of dirt in my hand.
I loved building that house with my dad, brick by brick from the ground.
I still remember the day the soldiers came in and burned everything up.
They took us all... lined us up against the wall...
Made us witness terrible things, terrible atrocities.
I couldn't save him.
Nothing I could do.
They killed the whole family.
But I didn't die.
I've been waiting 300 years for the human beings to do something good with themselves,
and it's all just a waste of time.
Maybe Morrison was right.
Maybe I should just let them all just burn and kill each other.
Maybe it's time for a fresh start.
None of Walker's credit cards have been used.
His car is still parked at his building.
No one saw him leave.
We looked at the stuff we found at his apartment.
It's clear he was taking this "Morrison angle" seriously.
I am dealing with a hostage situation, you're talking about a dead man?
Are we, or is Walker onto something that might prove otherwise?
SuperShock gave Walker the leads, right?
- Where is he in all this?
- Don't know.
But we have found an expert on Morrison, though.
It's a woman named Samara.
She's a bit of an internet celebrity.
She's a Powers truther, into conspiracy theories and shit.
Anyways, she's got the lock on Morrison lore so we're gonna head there next.
So what are you thinking?
If Morrison is real, he figured out Walker was hunting him and struck first.
- Find Morrison.
- Yes, sir.
Ladies, a construction site off Wilshire reported several sticks of commercial explosives missing early this morning.
Bomb squad says he's strapped himself with enough of it to kill everyone within a 30 foot radius of the blast.
What about a sharpshooter?
It's a big risk.
He's... keeping the hostages pretty close for insurance.
He's in over his head and he knows it.
How much is he asking for?
As much as he can carry, plus safe passage to a country that won't extradite him.
Some dad, huh?
Calista, we need your help.
What's the plan?
You're gonna walk in calmly and talk to him.
No.
Calista and I will go in together.
I will use my energy cubes to separate him from the hostages.
It'll be a bloodbath.
He wants to talk to you, alone.
'Course he does.
He thinks he can manipulate you into helping him.
Figures since it's worked in the past, why not the present?
Are you sure about this?
I'm not a little girl anymore.
That's what I'm counting on, and so are the 23 innocent people in that bank.
Guess getting resurrected burned a lot of calories, huh?
Goddamn it!
Why are you here?
To refill your water.
No, I'm fine, thanks.
Why are you here?
Maybe you should be more concerned about why you are here.
I mean, best guess, and you're not gonna like it, but...
I'm a Power.
Which is pretty fucked up when you think about it.
I mean, you, of all people, a Power.
I mean, if that's not irony, I don't know what is.
Wait, what...
What is that?
The thing you're doing with your face?
I'm thinking you away.
I don't think that's how it...
Works.
Look, Krispin, you need to start focusing on the cards you've been dealt here.
Think about it, no one even knows you're alive.
- So...
- So stay anonymous.
Don't register as a Power.
You could do so much damage.
If I die again, how do I know I'll even come back?
Only one way to find out.
Getting tired of waiting.
Yeah, I understand, but...
you're gonna have to give me some more time to...
Too bad, 'cause you're running out of it.
Mr. Secor, your daughter is not coming.
The fuck?
What do you mean she's not coming?
Please, try to remain calm.
Did you fucking talk to her?
Did you tell her what's happening?
Stay the fuck down!
Everybody, stay the fuck down!
You want me to make an example out of you, huh?
Is that what you want?
Oh, my God.
Let him go, Dad.
Well, Calista, that cop said you weren't even coming.
Like you raised me to take orders from cops.
Who here can open the vault so I can get this pathetic ass rag his money?
Don't fucking kill anyone while we're gone.
Thank you, sweetheart, I'll just... wait right here for you.
UNITY DECLARES:
THE GHOST IS DEAD
The guy keeps showing up throughout all of history, creating chaos under all sorts of names.
Mendoza, Manners, Caruthers, Grabowski.
He always shows up during historical catastrophes, like the proverbial bad penny, something my grandma used to say.
Now, I never found out what the penny did that was so bad, but this guy, he's the worst.
That's tit.
Is that it?
Yeah... it's cool.
That's it.
Now, depending on sources, there's also some super strength in there and the ability to disappear.
Like, turn invisible?
No, just, poof.
One minute there, next second gone in thin air.
Makes getting out of tough situations a snap.
Oh, he was supposedly in Hitler's bunker when the Russians came crashing in.
Wha...
Hitler's bunker?
Oh, yeah.
Total Nazi.
Here, look.
That looks like him.
It's freaky.
He was going by the name Oberholtzer.
Everybody thought he died in the bombing.
I think not.
Why not?
Two months ago, he called in to one of my live podcasts to correct me on some facts.
You're saying he called you?
And what makes you think Morrison wasn't involved in the Kennedy assassination, caller?
Because I was otherwise engaged at the time.
You?
You passing as Morrison, are you?
Kennedy's death is certainly something within my sphere of pleasure, but I'm sorry to say that was not my work.
And what are you otherwise engaged in?
I'm a great fan of music.
I've been collecting old pieces for decades, and I even produced a few things.
So you're a record producer and a maniac?
In November of that year, I was helping a group of young musicians get their second album out in America.
Such talent, especially John.
And who is "John," sir?
John Lennon.
What?
Can't enjoy the meal unless you set a proper table.
Wait a second, so this guy worked with...
Yeah.
That's Morrison.
In the '60s, he was around in the music scene until he suddenly vanished and disappeared, never to be seen again.
So what do you got for us?
Yeah, okay.
Jesus... here's... there's stuff in the background.
- Musicians get their second album out...
- Music and...
Such talent...
That is definitely an old cash register.
He called from a store?
A music store, I think.
Check this out.
Sounds like Jiminy Cricket.
It's Cliff Edwards, he was Jiminy Cricket.
Disney hired him for Pinocchio.
This song is from 1925.
Why do you know that?
Curiosity?
So Samara's live feed starts at 6:00 p.m.
Call comes in at 6:42 from an open store, doing business probably puts it on the West Coast and him in front of a computer or a smartphone, at least, to hear the live show.
All right, so let's go to some old record stores, flash his picture around.
If he's a collector, somebody's gonna know him.
Yeah.
Good job.
No problem.
Janice.
Oh, shit.
_
_
_
Hey, little brother.
That's a good way to get yourself killed.
Look at that.
Knew I could count on you, baby girl.
I knew you'd also see that I was driven to this.
You know, that it's that it's not me, you know.
It's...
That it's a matter of circumstance.
A lot of people have worse lives than you and they never hurt anyone.
Yeah, that's true, but... after this I'll never have to hurt anyone again.
I mean, you get that, right?
You got to, 'cause you you came to save me.
I'm here to save these people.
I'm sorry I wasn't a better man.
I want to be.
Even think I could, given the chance.
Every word that comes out of your mouth is one God damn manipulative lie after the next, and you're asking me for forgiveness?
Not every word.
Not these.
Calista.
Calista.
Give me a chance.
Give me a chance.
Okay.
Yeah.
Okay.
Then let's fly.
How's this work?
This is amazing.
Isn't it?
We can go anywhere.
Where do you want to go, baby girl?
The only place you can go.
Goodbye, Daddy.
Wait, honey!
No, no!
If anything has happened to her, it's on you.
This is one mountain you're not gonna walk down.
Once you step off that cliff, gonna be the first mistake you're gonna make of many.
If you want to go back outside, I think it's kind of dumb.
Look what I found.
Your old coat.
That's not my coat, Patrick.
It sure is.
Here.
That is your coat, put it on.
Patrick, I don't need your fucking coat.
Put it on!
I need you to take me back home, please.
Coat is on.
Will you take me back, please?
I say we weather out the storm here for a little while, and I'm gonna make some tea.
Yeah, well...
I'm feeling a lot better, you know.
- We could...
- Do you?
Thank you.
I'm no stranger to... problems with the mind.
You know, I wanted to get back because
I wanted to work on finding Morrison.
I think I have an idea of where he might be.
Where would that be?
Hiding in plain sight.
Close by, you know.
I...
I think he'd want to keep an eye on things.
Makes sense.
Yeah.
You know, if we... analyze the conflict hot spots
and try to see how they might connect to Senator Brown's death, who else might have been murdered, you know, how they intersect, maybe we have a shot at pinpointing his location.
You think so?
Yeah, but I can't do it from here.
I'd need to have the resources of Powers Division.
Us?
Powers?
I think we're responsible for all this bullshit.
I think we created Morrison, the worst of the worst, and... that fucker, Wolfe.
Yeah, fucking asshole.
We should start with The Ghost.
Yeah, start with Morrison.
If he exists, and I now believe he does, thanks to you, we need to bring him to justice, Patrick.
You know, you and me, huh?
Just like old times, huh?
But we can't, we can't do it from here, Patrick.
We can't do it from your cabin on top of a mountain, in the middle of nowhere.
Aconcagua.
Fucking what?
Aconcagua.
It's up in the Andes.
It's the only place I can think of he hasn't had his grubby, little paws on.
Okay, sure, yeah.
Let's get you back to civilization.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Yes, sir, yeah.
One small step for man...
Did it look this high to you from the ground looking up?
Nope.
Perspective's a bitch, huh?
This is crazy.
Let's hold hands when we do it.
No way.
What are you doing?
!
This is gonna be so epic!
You're gonna go splat, and then unsplat.
Any idea how cool that is?
But what if I don't unsplat?
Come on, man, don't wuss out on me now.
I'm not doing it!
Krispin, you're not doing it alone.
I'm right here.
I always said we'd do great things together, didn't I?
Well, consider this a leap of faith.
Literally.
Why do you want to do this so badly, jump with me?
Way I see it, we jump here together, and we'll only grow stronger.
"We"?
You keep saying that, like somehow we made each other better, but we didn't!
Our lives unraveled... since we started Kaotic Chic!
Don't kid yourself, Krispin.
Your life unraveled long before we met.
I've never seen it before, but I see it now.
You're weak.
Me?
Please.
Before I found you online, you were nothing but a spineless, whiny mess, who locked himself in his room, drawing out his feelings.
Okay, then.
Jump.
Okay!
Glad you got that out of your system.
- Let's jump.
- No.
Not us... you.
Come again?
You heard me.
Jump!
Why so scared all of a sudden?
You're not even living, so why be afraid to jump on your own?
Krispin, we...
You can't do anything without me, can you?
Tortured spirit or something of my own creation, like you said, it doesn't matter.
What matters is that you're here because of me.
Yes!
Okay, is that what you wanted to hear, that we're in this together?
But I don't need you.
What?
You heard me.
Krispin, don't do this.
God damn it, you need me.
You need me and you know it.
No.
Not anymore.
Krispin, don't, don't!
No!
No, Krispin!
Don't you fucking leave me!
- Do you want to call...
- Okay.
What number is this?
It's 22.
23 is across the street.
And they said vinyl was dead.
Same about Morrison, huh?
Yeah.
Hey, can I just say something, real quick?
Okay.
I just want you to know, I'm officially backing off.
Yeah, let me finish...
You know I like you.
Think I made that... pretty clear.
But I understand that you're uncomfortable with this.
I'm not uncomfortable.
I'm just not...
Ready, willing, or able.
Okay.
It's okay.
It doesn't even matter, you know.
Point is, I'm taking a step back... and, if you ever... change your mind, want me to step up again, let me know.
Until then, we're... simply co-workers.
Okay.
Thank you.
So, what's next?
I'll take 22, you take 23.
- I meant...
- I know what you meant.
But Walker's missing and we're hunting a ghost, so what are you gonna do?
Okay.
Hello.
Anything special you're looking for?
Without even looking at you, I'm pinning you as a
"Townes Van Zandt" kind of guy.
More "John Prine" type.
That was my second guess.
Are these all first pressings?
Why carry anything else?
Harvest...
Wait, is this The Stones' "Sticky Fingers" mono version?
Orange sticker and all.
I am a bit of a collector.
Shit.
More than a collector, I've been to 20-some-odd record stores and nobody comes close to your selection.
Keen an eye as you got, since you've yet to ask about any prices,
I get the feeling you're after something else.
Well, yes and no.
Curious about perhaps a customer.
You mind taking a look at a photo?
Sure.
Let me just hop down there and...
You all right?
Good catch.
In the old days,
I would have just disappeared.
But... time has taken its toll, so,
I have to stand my ground now.
You understand.
Look at that.
Gone and bled all over my stacks.
Still gonna give you a parting gift, though.
Hello?
!
Kutter?
!
All right, I'm here, I'm here.
I got you, I got you.
I got you.
Don't try to speak.
Don't try to speak.
All right, I got you.
You're gonna get through this.
Stay with me.
- 911, what's your emergency?
- Yeah.
Yeah, this is Detective Deena Pilgrim, Badge 7-4-9-9-0-3.
No, no, no, stay here.
I got an officer down.
I need an ambulance ASAP.
8029 Edinburg Avenue.
Repeat it back!
8029 Edinburg Avenue.
- Yeah.
- We have an ambulance on the way.
Yeah!
Yeah, send it now!
What, what is this?
What... what?
It's Morrison?
It was Morrison?
You don't to speak.
Don't try... don't...
We're gonna find him, okay?
Stay with me, okay?
Stay with me!
Stay with me.
Stay with me.
Stay with me.
Stay with me.
I'm here to register as a Power.
Sure you are.
And what exactly is your power, pal?
I'm still trying to figure it all out, actually.
But I did just come back from the dead after jumping off the roof of a 20-story building.
So that's got to count for something, right?
Krispin?
Hey, Commander Cross.
Previously on Powers...
Why are you doing this?
Funny, that's what momma said every time you threw her against the door.
That's Calista.
She's a Power, all right.
But... she isn't right in the head.
Mr. Secor, can you give us anything that would help track her down?
Senator Bailey Brown, also known as the Cobalt Knight, was found murdered in his Los Angeles office this morning, head crushed.
I know who killed the Knight.
Who?
It was him.
Morrison.
You might know him better as The Ghost.
He killed Senator Brown, and he's gonna kill me next.
So you found him, huh?
The Ghost?
I got to start closing that door.
Yes and no.
What's that supposed to mean?
Christ, can can you give me a second?
What'd you find out?
Well, there, there isn't that much to go on, but what there is has him dead in '67.
Morrison is not dead.
According to every written word on the matter, yes he is.
And you killed him.
You said so yourself at a press conference.
I got it wrong.
What?
Patrick, Morrison hasn't been seen in over 50 years.
What makes you think he'd come back?
He likes the long game.
Hell, he invented it.
Janice's murder brought him out.
He saw a weakness in the Unity, and... went after Cobalt Knight.
No.
Now, Unity hasn't been "Unity" in a long time.
He hasn't stopped killing.
He's gone, Patrick, okay?
I'm the target.
I always have been.
People don't just come back from the dead.
You sure about that?
Go to TUSUBTITULO C-O-M for more exclusive subs.
Have you seen my...
I think I've seen your everything.
How 'bout you drive me to work so I can keep it going?
You know we are not driving in to work together.
Why are we still doing this?
What's so funny?
Don't do that.
Do what?
Try to turn this into something serious.
Deena, I just...
I'll drive us into work.
No, Kutter, please, do not fuck this up.
Being together fucks this up.
No, there is a time and a place, but work ain't it.
Driving isn't working.
What...
What...
What are you doing?
Carpooling, what are you doing?
Defining boundaries.
Fuck.
Consider them defined.
Don't...
Okay.
Let's say, hypothetically, that you're right, that Morrison's alive.
Why does he... kill Senator Brown now?
Well, that's kind of like asking why a scorpion stings.
Because it's in his nature.
No, because the bastard's an evil fuck, a provocateur.
Morrison's a Level Ten, according to the apes and the way they categorize everything.
He can do whatever the fuck he wants whenever the fuck he wants to do it.
Like survive a combined onslaught from Unity?
Come on.
Even Janice said he was dead.
No, she lied.
And so did I.
We beat him up pretty good, but couldn't find a body, so... she wanted to make a statement to the press to make people feel safe.
I don't remember Janice lying about anything, ever.
Well, maybe you didn't know her as well as you thought you did.

No.
Yes.

I'm not a Power.

Drink it, please.
Okay.
Okay, I'm done.
I...
I got to get back.
Thank you.
Thank you for taking care of me, Patrick, but I I got to go.
I...
I can't move my legs.
That's a side effect.
I can't feel my fucking legs, Patrick.
Just get some rest, Diamond, you'll be fine by the morning.
In the morning?
Yeah, give or take.
Lay down.
Mili Pavle.
Zasto uze tebe...
Gentlemen, you seen Walker today?
Clay, you seen Walker?
Yeah, I understand.
We'll get it down there as soon as possible.
Tell him she's on her way.
Yeah, lie to him.
Tell him she's... putting out a fire in India or something and she's running late.
All right.
Call me if things change.
What is happening?
Calista Secor's father came to town to hold up a bank and take hostages.
You and Walker, find Calista.
See if we can't talk him out of doing this before he does something we'll all regret.
I...
I can't find Walker, no one's seen him this morning.
Is he just being Walker or is this something else?
Given recent events, and his headache thing,
I'd like to check his apartment.
Yeah.
Go.
The Secor thing, you...
I got it.
And take Kutter.
I'm good, really.
Take him.
Come with me.
I'm busy.
I need you with me.
Kutter, what are you waiting for?
Go after her!
Now!
The fuck is going on?
For security reasons, after a silent alarm was tripped, indicating a robbery in progress.
Almost two dozen people are being held hostage at a Wilshire Boulevard bank.
The gunman has not made his demands known yet, but LAPD confirms that he is wearing a vest rigged with explosives.
What's wrong with people?
We should suit up and get down there.
Oh, my God.
Police have not release the identity of the bomber, but this security camera image appears to be a match for convicted felon Todd Secor.
- We will bring you up to date...
- That's my Dad.
Best keep it down.
I mean, I'd hate to rile the others.
Oh, my God.
Relax, pretty boy.
You still got your looks.
Do you want to give that guy a heart attack?
Don't worry.
He can't see me.
TU SUBTITULO
But he can see you.
What's happening?
The dawn of your brave new world, I think.
How do you feel?
Not dead!
You don't look dead.
You do.
You know what the weird thing is?
I feel fucking fabulous.
Now, let's get out of here.
See how the world treats you.
Or... how you... want to treat the world,
Mr. Back From The Dead.
Walker.
Walker!
Walker.
You want to help or...
He's probably drunk.
Break down the door.
You break down the door.
He could be in trouble in there.
Walker?
Armed police officers on the premises.
If anyone is here, show yourself, now!
Place is empty.
Surprise, surprise.
What's that?
Research.
We got to get this place locked down, processed.
Crime scene?
I don't know yet.
Who's Morrison?
And what is he doing?
Chasing a ghost.
UNITY DECLARES THE GHOST IS DEAD
All I've ever really wanted was a simple life.
I wanted to be a farmer, just like my father before me and his father before him.
I loved the smell of dirt in my hand.
I loved building that house with my dad, brick by brick from the ground.
I still remember the day the soldiers came in and burned everything up.
They took us all... lined us up against the wall...
Made us witness terrible things, terrible atrocities.
I couldn't save him.
Nothing I could do.
They killed the whole family.
But I didn't die.
I've been waiting 300 years for the human beings to do something good with themselves, and it's all just a waste of time.
Maybe Morrison was right.
Maybe I should just let them all just burn and kill each other.
Maybe it's time for a fresh start.
None of Walker's credit cards have been used.
His car is still parked at his building.
No one saw him leave.
We looked at the stuff we found at his apartment.
It's clear he was taking this "Morrison angle" seriously.
I am dealing with a hostage situation, you're talking about a dead man?
Are we, or is Walker onto something that might prove otherwise?
SuperShock gave Walker the leads, right?
- Where is he in all this?
- Don't know.
But we have found an expert on Morrison, though.
It's a woman named Samara.
She's a bit of an internet celebrity.
She's a Powers truther, into conspiracy theories and shit.
Anyways, she's got the lock on Morrison lore so we're gonna head there next.
So what are you thinking?
If Morrison is real, he figured out Walker was hunting him and struck first.
- Find Morrison.
- Yes, sir.
Ladies, a construction site off Wilshire reported several sticks of commercial explosives missing early this morning.
Bomb squad says he's strapped himself with enough of it to kill everyone within a 30foot radius of the blast.
What about a sharpshooter?
It's a big risk.
He's... keeping the hostages pretty close for insurance.
He's in over his head and he knows it.
How much is he asking for?
As much as he can carry, plus safe passage to a country that won't extradite him.
Some dad, huh?
Calista, we need your help.
What's the plan?
You're gonna walk in calmly and talk to him.
No.
Calista and I will go in together.
I will use my energy cubes to separate him from the hostages.
It'll be a bloodbath.
He wants to talk to you, alone.
'Course he does.
He thinks he can manipulate you into helping him.
Figures since it's worked in the past, why not the present?
Are you sure about this?
I'm not a little girl anymore.
That's what I'm counting on, and so are the 23 innocent people in that bank.
Guess getting resurrected burned a lot of calories, huh?
Goddamn it!
Why are you here?
To refill your water.
No, I'm fine, thanks.
Why are you here?
Maybe you should be more concerned about why you are here.
I mean, best guess, and you're not gonna like it, but...
I'm a Power.
Which is pretty fucked up when you think about it.
I mean, you, of all people, a Power.
I mean, if that's not irony, I don't know what is.
Wait, what...
What is that?
The thing you're doing with your face?
I'm thinking you away.
I don't think that's how it...
Works.
Look, Krispin, you need to start focusing on the cards you've been dealt here.
Think about it, no one even knows you're alive.
- So...
- So stay anonymous.
Don't register as a Power.
You could do so much damage.
If I die again, how do I know I'll even come back?
Only one way to find out.
Getting tired of waiting.
Yeah, I understand, but...
you're gonna have to give me
- some more time to...
- Too bad, 'cause you're running out of it.
Mr. Secor, your daughter is not coming.
The fuck?
What do you mean she's not coming?
Please, try to remain calm.
Did you fucking talk to her?
Did you tell her what's happening?
Stay the fuck down!
Everybody, stay the fuck down!
You want me to make an example out of you, huh?
Is that what you want?
Oh, my God.
Let him go, Dad.
Well, Calista, that cop said you weren't even coming.
Like you raised me to take orders from cops.
Who here can open the vault so I can get this pathetic ass rag his money?
Don't fucking kill anyone while we're gone.
Thank you, sweetheart, I'll just... wait right here for you.
UNITY DECLARES:
THE GHOST IS DEAD
The guy keeps showing up throughout all of history, creating chaos under all sorts of names.
Mendoza, Manners, Caruthers, Grabowski.
He always shows up during historical catastrophes, like the proverbial bad penny, something my grandma used to say.
Now, I never found out what the penny did that was so bad,
- but this guy, he's the worst.
- GHOST DEAD?
That's tit.
Is that it?
Yeah... it's cool.
That's it.
Now, depending on sources, there's also some super strength in there and the ability to disappear.
Like, turn invisible?
No, just, poof.
One minute there, next second gone in thin air.
Makes getting out of tough situations a snap.
Oh, he was supposedly in Hitler's bunker when the Russians came crashing in.
Wha...
Hitler's bunker?
Oh, yeah.
Total Nazi.
Here, look.
That looks like him.
It's freaky.
He was going by the name Oberholtzer.
Everybody thought he died in the bombing.
I think not.
Why not?
Two months ago, he called in to one of my live podcasts to correct me on some facts.
You're saying he called you?
SuperShock will visit TUSUBTITULO
And what makes you think Morrison wasn't involved in the Kennedy assassination, caller?
Because I was otherwise engaged at the time.
You?
You passing as Morrison, are you?
Kennedy's death is certainly something within my sphere of pleasure, but I'm sorry to say that was not my work.
And what are you otherwise engaged in?
I'm a great fan of music.
I've been collecting old pieces for decades, and I even produced a few things.
So you're a record producer and a maniac?
In November of that year, I was helping a group of young musicians get their second album out in America.
Such talent, especially John.
And who is "John," sir?
John Lennon.
What?
Can't enjoy the meal unless you set a proper table.
Wait a second, so this guy worked with...
Yeah.
That's Morrison.
In the '60s, he was around in the music scene until he suddenly vanished and disappeared, never to be seen again.
So what do you got for us?
Yeah, okay.
Jesus... here's... there's stuff in the background.
- Musicians get their second album out...
- Music and...
- Such talent...
- That is definitely an old cash register.
He called from a store?
A music store, I think.
Check this out.
Sounds like Jiminy Cricket.
It's Cliff Edwards, he was Jiminy Cricket.
Disney hired him for Pinocchio.
This song is from 1925.
Why do you know that?
Curiosity?
So Samara's live feed starts at 6:00 p.m.
Call comes in at 6:42 from an open store, doing business probably puts it on the West Coast and him in front of a computer or a smartphone, at least, to hear the live show.
All right, so let's go to some old record stores, flash his picture around.
If he's a collector, somebody's gonna know him.
Yeah.
Good job.
No problem.
Janice.
Oh, shit.
_
_
_
Hey, little brother.
That's a good way to get yourself killed.
Look at that.
Knew I could count on you, baby girl.
I knew you'd also see that I was driven to this.
You know, that it's that it's not me, you know.
It's...
That it's a matter of circumstance.
A lot of people have worse lives than you and they never hurt anyone.
Yeah, that's true, but... after this I'll never have to hurt anyone again.
I mean, you get that, right?
You got to, 'cause you you came to save me.
I'm here to save these people.
I'm sorry I wasn't a better man.
I want to be.
Even think I could, given the chance.
Every word that comes out of your mouth is one God damn manipulative lie after the next, and you're asking me for forgiveness?
Not every word.
Not these.
Calista.
Calista.
Give me a chance.
Give me a chance.
Okay.
Yeah.
Okay.
Then let's fly.
How's this work?
This is amazing.
Isn't it?
We can go anywhere.
Where do you want to go, baby girl?
The only place you can go.
Goodbye, Daddy.
Wait, honey!
No, no!
If anything has happened to her, it's on you.
This is one mountain you're not gonna walk down.
Once you step off that cliff, gonna be the first mistake you're gonna make of many.
If you want to go back outside, I think it's kind of dumb.
Look what I found.
Your old coat.
That's not my coat, Patrick.
It sure is.
Here.
That is your coat, put it on.
Patrick, I don't need your fucking coat.
Put it on!
I need you to take me back home, please.
Coat is on.
Will you take me back, please?
I say we weather out the storm here for a little while, and I'm gonna make some tea.
Yeah, well...
I'm feeling a lot better, you know.
- We could...
- Do you?
Thank you.
I'm no stranger to... problems with the mind.
You know, I wanted to get back because
I wanted to work on finding Morrison.
I think I have an idea of where he might be.
Where would that be?
Hiding in plain sight.
Close by, you know.
I...
I think he'd want to keep an eye on things.
Makes sense.
Yeah.
You know, if we... analyze the conflict hot spots and try to see how they might connect to Senator Brown's death, who else might have been murdered, you know, how they intersect, maybe we have a shot at pinpointing his location.
You think so?
Yeah, but I can't do it from here.
I'd need to have the resources of Powers Division.
Us?
Powers?
I think we're responsible for all this bullshit.
I think we created Morrison, the worst of the worst, and... that fucker, Wolfe.
Yeah, fucking asshole.
We should start with The Ghost.
Yeah, start with Morrison.
If he exists, and I now believe he does, thanks to you, we need to bring him to justice, Patrick.
You know, you and me, huh?
Just like old times, huh?
But we can't, we can't do it from here, Patrick.
We can't do it from your cabin on top of a mountain, in the middle of nowhere.
Aconcagua.
Fucking what?
Aconcagua.
It's up in the Andes.
It's the only place I can think of he hasn't had his grubby, little paws on.
Okay, sure, yeah.
Let's get you back to civilization.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Yes, sir, yeah.
One small step for man...
Did it look this high to you from the ground looking up?
Nope.
Perspective's a bitch, huh?
This is crazy.
Let's hold hands when we do it.
No way.
What are you doing?
!
This is gonna be so epic!
You're gonna go splat, and then unsplat.
Any idea how cool that is?
But what if I don't unsplat?
Come on, man, don't wuss out on me now.
I'm not doing it!
Krispin, you're not doing it alone.
I'm right here.
I always said we'd do great things together, didn't I?
Well, consider this a leap of faith.
Literally.
Why do you want to do this so badly, jump with me?
Way I see it, we jump here together, and we'll only grow stronger.
"We"?
You keep saying that, like somehow we made each other better, but we didn't!
Our lives unraveled... since we started Kaotic Chic!
Don't kid yourself, Krispin.
Your life unraveled long before we met.
I've never seen it before, but I see it now.
You're weak.
Me?
Please.
Before I found you online, you were nothing but a spineless, whiny mess, who locked himself in his room, drawing out his feelings.
Okay, then.
Jump.
Okay!
Glad you got that out of your system.
- Let's jump.
- No.
Not us... you.
Come again?
You heard me.
Jump!
Why so scared all of a sudden?
You're not even living, so why be afraid to jump on your own?
- Krispin, we...
- You can't do anything without me, can you?
Tortured spirit or something of my own creation, like you said, it doesn't matter.
What matters is that you're here because of me.
Yes!
Okay, is that what you wanted to hear, that we're in this together?
But I don't need you.
What?
You heard me.
Krispin, don't do this.
God damn it, you need me.
You need me and you know it.
No.
Not anymore.
Krispin, don't, don't!
No!
No, Krispin!
Don't you fucking leave me!
- Do you want to call...
- Okay.
What number is this?
It's 22.
23 is across the street.
And they said vinyl was dead.
Same about Morrison, huh?
Yeah.
Hey, can I just say something, real quick?
Okay.
I just want you to know, I'm officially backing off.
Yeah, let me finish...
You know I like you.
Think I made that... pretty clear.
But I understand that you're uncomfortable with this.
I'm not uncomfortable.
I'm just not...
Ready, willing, or able.
Okay.
It's okay.
It doesn't even matter, you know.
Point is, I'm taking a step back... and, if you ever... change your mind, want me to step up again, let me know.
Until then, we're... simply co-workers.
Okay.
Thank you.
So, what's next?
I'll take 22, you take 23.
- I meant...
- I know what you meant.
But Walker's missing and we're hunting a ghost, so what are you gonna do?
Okay.
Hello.
Anything special you're looking for?
Without even looking at you, I'm pinning you as a
"Townes Van Zandt" kind of guy.
More "John Prine" type.
That was my second guess.
Are these all first pressings?
Why carry anything else?
Harvest...
Wait, is this The Stones' "Sticky Fingers" mono version?
Orange sticker and all.
I am a bit of a collector.
Shit.
More than a collector, I've been to 20-some-odd record stores and nobody comes close to your selection.
Keen an eye as you got, since you've yet to ask about any prices,
I get the feeling you're after something else.
Well, yes and no.
Curious about perhaps a customer.
You mind taking a look at a photo?
Sure.
Let me just hop down there and...
You all right?
Good catch.
Deena will visit TU SUB TITULO
In the old days,
I would have just disappeared.
But... time has taken its toll, so,
I have to stand my ground now.
You understand.
Look at that.
Gone and bled all over my stacks.
Still gonna give you a parting gift, though.
Hello?
!
Kutter?
