Right here, the one I'm holding up.
Yeah?
Now pull it back towards your eyes.
Don't even think about it.
Go!
That means you're left-eye dominant.
That means you close your right eye when you shoot.
There's a couple universal rules when you're handling a weapon.
Number one is, you don't point the weapon at anything unless you're prepared to shoot.
Wanna hold your...
Keep your thumbs relaxed.
You want to put it right over the front sighting.
Then, when you pull the trigger, just the same steady pressure.
Go.
Bingo.

I told you.
Are you calling me a liar?
Your very own...
I hit the balloon.
...little pink, uh...
He just wants a toy that I hit!
Mommy, it's okay.
Just zip it, okay?
Look, you just can't let people walk all...
You know, this is bullshit.
Look, lady, it's called Pop the Balloon.
You want something...
Stay here.
...then pop the fucking balloon.
Don't fuck...
Don't curse in front of my child.
Look at that.
Magic.
Here you go.
Whoa.
What is this?
Are you charity night at the fair?
I'm just trying to help.
Help?
Help with what?
I don't need you...
You know what?
My kid, my business, okay?
Jenny...
is everything okay?
No.
This a-hole is trying to steal my cash, and this one is sticking his face where it doesn't belong.
I think I have it from here, sir.
Appreciate it.
Here you go.
Thank you.
Yeah!
Whoo!
Whoo!
When all of this is over, I want to leave and go on a trip with you.
Where would we go?
I don't know.
Your beach.
From the photos.
What about your mom?
You still like her.
Cate...
How did you guys meet?
Your mom?
She was, uh, young, and she was with a dance company.
And, uh, she was pretty opinionated.
Gave me, uh...
Gave me a hard time most of the time.
I don't know.
She made me laugh, I guess.
Well, then you came along.
We should take a picture while we're still at the top.
Okay.
That's a good idea.
All right.
You ready?
Yep.
Ready?
One, two, three.
Hello, Matty.
Jesus!
Christ, Cap.
What are you doing with I.A.?
What are you talking about?
I didn't speak to them.
I got pictures.
You're as dirty as me, pal.
Question is, what the hell could you have that they want?
You've been thinking about making a deal, haven't you, Matty?
I didn't say nothing.
They wanted to talk.
I didn't...
Fu...
Fuck you!
I got him here, just like you said.
I did good, right?
That you did.
This is Detective Keenan.
Shots fired, officer down.
Repeat: shots fired, officer down.
Signal 50 and 48.
Send the fucking E.M.s now!
Where you at, Detective?
Blue Bird Motel, Glenwood and Avery.
Oh, geez!
Hurry!
Roger.
Signal 50 and 48.
E.M.s on the way.
Can you identify the suspect?
Nick Barrow.
You're gonna get us out of this, right?
Yeah.
I am.
He killed a cop!
Are you sure?
I'm holding the fucking APB in my hand.
I...
I don't know that there's anything else I can do for you now.
There's nothing else you can do, Oscar?
You better hope that's not the case, my friend.
Chief?
Chief, let's go!
Mm...
Rise and shine.
Time to fight bad guys.
Morning.
Mm-hmm.
How can you say that?
The Sex Pistols were a great band.
No, they were a great bad band.
Cate, something's happened.
What?
Pack your stuff now.
Why?
Because they found us.
Wait.
I thought you said no one knew where we were.
Cate, I'm serious.
- Come on.
Grab your bag.
- We gotta go.
Nick.
Nick.
It's okay, Cate.
I got a plan.
I need you to do exactly what I say.
We need something to separate the sheriff and the deputy.
Then we can meet at the rendezvous point in ten minutes.
- Put your hands up.
- Don't move!
If something goes wrong, no matter what happens, get out of town and do not come back.
This is non-negotiable.
Get out the way!
Coming through!
Freeze!
Come on, Cate.
Out!
Out of the car right now!
Get down.
Don't move!
Oh, I got your ass now.
Try and run again.
Put your hands up and get on your knees.
Lay down!
"Nicholas Barrow, wanted for the murder of Detective Matthew Miller."
Is this you?
Do you believe everything you read?
Yeah, when it has the words "APB" on top of it, I do.
Some people got killed, and the person who put me on that APB thinks that I did it.
And that's your story, and you're sticking to that, huh?
Hey, Sheriff, will you listen to me?
The guy that I'm running from has connections everywhere.
That APB isn't real.
He's using you to track me down.
Don't make that call!
Please don't make that call!
I want you to sit down!
A man lives his life, and everything he was fits into a goddamn box.
He say anything?
What?
Matty.
Did he say anything before he passed?
He was pretty far gone.
First Dinardi, now Matty.
You saw him, right?
I mean Barrow.
You...
You saw him?
Yeah, I saw him.
What about it?
What went down?
Why not put two in his head right then and there?
What do you want from me, Darrell, huh?
You want to hear me say I fucked up?
Fine, I fucked up!
All right?
You happy?
He got the jump on me.
Barrow got the jump on me.
I had to make a decision.
Hey, Cap.
We got him.
Call just came in from a sheriff on the APB you put out.
All right.
Let's do this.
Boss, they're here.
I'm Detective Garcia, the two-four.
I'm looking for Sheriff Braydon.
- Right here.
- Sheriff, you have to listen to me.
These guys aren't cops.
Look like cops to me.
Sheriff, will you listen to me?
He been like this the whole time?
Sheriff, these guys aren't...
We good to go?
Yeah, as soon as we verify your badge numbers.
7138.
7396.
Call them in, Dean.
You got it.
Zone nine.
P.A.
Uh, Sheriff Braydon's office up in Hastings.
We're looking to confirm two badge numbers relating to a transfer.
Sure.
Hold on.
All right.
First one.
Thank you.
Sheriff!
Sheriff, these guys aren't cops!
Sheriff, please.
Nick...
I no longer care about you, Nick.
You are dead.
I'm gonna send you to your grave, and then I'm going to do the same thing to your daughter.
Hey.
Uh, that was weird.
What was weird?
I just got a call from A.P.D. C.I.
A detective named Keenan.
He's 15 minutes out to pick up his prisoner.
What prisoner?
Barrow.
Keenan's freaking out.
He's never heard of anyone named Detective Garcia, and...
Son of a bitch!
Don't call anyone!
Get Dean!
How did you get me on the APB?
Are you sick enough to kill a cop just to set me up?
I didn't kill any cop.
Then how did you...
Shit!
Dean!
Dean!
Fuck!
Where the fuck you at?
Dean!
Shut your ass up!
You know how to use that thing?
You want to find out?
Put your hands up.
Give me the keys.
Get down!
Put your gun on him.
Now it's my turn to talk.
I didn't kill Alejandro, Victor.
I think the guy behind this name is Keenan, and he's a cop.
How do I know you weren't in on it?
I've got nothing to hide.
That's why I'm not gonna kill you.
You're not gonna kill me because if you do... this will never end.
I'm gonna prove to you that I had nothing to do with it.
And then I'm gonna ask for something in return.
Your word as a father that when you hear the truth, that you leave Cate alone.
I didn't kill Alejandro, Victor.
Go.
Get down.
Get down.
Come on.
I told you this was non-negotiable.
I just saved your life.
Okay?
A thank you would be nice.
Well, don't do it again.
I was trying to help you!
I don't need your help!
Oh, you could have fooled me.
I can't do this if I know you're in danger.
And as long as you're with me...
You're starting to become...
What?
I'm starting to become what?
Too involved.
I want to be involved!
What if you got hurt?
Everything I would have done would have meant nothing.
Everything you've done?
Everything I've done has been for you.
The running!
The hiding!
All of it has been for you!
Damn it, Nick!
I just want to help you.
I don't need your help.
Cate.
Open the...
Cate!
Cate!
Run a print on this.
Prints match the ones that was taken off the keychain.
She got busted with a couple of friends.
What did I tell you?
Who was arrested with her?
Who bailed her out?
I want all the information.
All of it!
You got it, Cap.
Becca, I'm at your place, you need to call me.
This day could not end soon enough.
I couldn't find Cate and my window was closing with Victor.
Matty's death just wasn't sitting right with me.
Would Keenan really be desperate enough to kill his own men?
And if so, why?
I had Harper do some digging into Matty's personal files.
Turns out the guy was going through a nasty divorce.
But Miller was crafty.
He started a dummy corporation which had only one hidden asset.
A boat.
Sounds like a good place to start.
- Cate!
- Not quite.
Keenan.
Very good, Nick.
Let me talk to my daughter.
Nick, I want you to listen to me very carefully.
I'm gonna give you an address, and I don't give a shit if you're in Timbuktu.
You've got 15 minutes to get there.
Now you listen to me, you fuck.
If you harm her in any way
I promise, I'll...
Nick, I need you to focus, okay?
Otherwise you're not gonna make it in time.
I have your money.
What money?
The money Matty Miller took.
I got it.
Mechanicsville, south side of the old brickworks.
Come alone.
No tricks.
Send her over, Keenan.
And the money?
Somewhere close.
And that's where it stays until I have my daughter.
Then you've made a critical error in judgment.
Just like Matty Miller?
What the fuck is he talking about?
He's talking shit.
Only thing that makes sense, Keenan.
Internal affairs, right?
Is that why you killed him?
He turned on you?
You killed Matty?
He was gonna give the money over to I.A.
He had you dead to rights.
He had all of you.
You motherfucker!
How does he know about all this shit, Cap?
Doesn't matter!
If there's money floating around, it's gonna take us down!
You gonna kill everybody, Keenan?
What the hell else you ain't telling us, Cap?
Nothing.
I thought you said we were all in the fucking clear, huh?
Mosley!
Ah!
Fuck!
Fuck you, Keenan!
This way.
It's over now, right?
Almost.
Soon.
You saved me.
Yeah.
Well then, we're even.
Now this could be tricky.
And a lot more dangerous.
We got the context.
Keenan, Victor, everyone we need.
All right, here's the plan.
We gotta spread a little rumor...
Wait a minute.
I have an idea.
No.
You do not have any idea, okay?
You are not getting involved in this.
Nick, you just said it yourself...
I am not getting in this with you right now.
We don't have a choice.
No way, Cate.
No way.
Now the next part of this can get a little more difficult.
We get through this and the heat is off.
Then you're done with this.
Clean slate.
It's not about going inside or outside.
It's about being smart, not drawing attention to yourself, blending in.
You look.
You wait.
You think.
The sight lines are the front of our target.
Then there's the exit plan.
Are you walking out or you driving out?
Don't point the weapon at anything unless you're prepared to shoot.
Detective Keenan!
You gonna kill me?
You know the best advice my father ever gave me, Detective?
Don't sell myself short.
Ever.
Killing's the easy part.
Getting away with it.
That's the trick.
You have two neighbors.
One is away for another two weeks.
The other couple is home.
The lady's at least 75.
Her husband's older.
It's now 10:20.
She's been asleep for two hours.
He's parked in front of the TV watching the Braves, hearing aid out.
And then, of course, there's this.
You're a drinker.
Now, it might take a lot, and you might hide it well, but I know.
How many times have you come out here and waved your gun around?
Or yelled at some kids for hitting a ball into your yard?
I think I can get away with it.
You just made a pretty good case of why I could kill you, too.
Answer this.
Why my dad?
Your dad fills a lot of holes, sweetheart.
Gave Victor Vasquez someone to blame for his son's murder so he could move on with his life.
You know, there was only one thing that could put me in jail, and you saved me the trouble of having to go look for it by bringing it right to me and putting it in my refrigerator.
Go home, kid.
What was it you said, Detective?
I need to move on with my life?
Hm?
Well, guess what?
I'm not ready.
What are you gonna do to him?
Nothing good.
"D.A. recovered stolen evidence money.
Detective Keenan's still missing, wanted for multiple murders within the Atlanta PD.
In light of these developments, original suspect Nick Barrow has been exonerated of all charges."
Looks like I won't be collecting that insurance money.
No.
I think you got a better payout.
You're right.
Appreciate it, Harp.
Get out of here, kid.
Well, it looks like my plan worked out pretty well.
Yeah.
I was closer than you think.
Old habits die hard.
Lucy and I finally spoke, and were able to agree on one thing.
Going forward, it would be best for her to focus on getting better.
If she needed anything, we'd be there for her.
Lucy also thought that the best thing for Cate was to live with me.
I agreed.
I guess maybe I was more ready to be a dad than I realized.
Do you think... that when we're back in town
I'll be seeing a lot of you?
Will you be seeing a lot of me?
Well, let's see.
I do live in an apartment by myself.
I was thinking about getting a fish.
Yeah, you'll be seeing a lot of me.
Okay, good, because there's this place I do my recitals.
And they're closed every Sunday.
What are you talking about?
Most people pay cash so the cash register's gotta be completely full, and I already have a good out.
Okay, the place next to it?
Went out of business.
They're completely vacant.
No one's in the area.
I could get in and out of there so quickly.
Okay, let's just take it one step at a time here, please.
Focus on graduating high school.
I'm just saying.
Uh-huh.
I have something for you.
What is it?
Well, I...
I know you have a bunch of just me.
I thought maybe you'd like one with both of us.
I love it.

Morning, Sir Roger!
Remember me?
Ma Brewer.
- Give my regards to Lady Scatcherd.
- Sir Roger, please can you help me?
I've got three kids.
I'm all on my own.
Fresh lavender.
- What else is there to do?
- It seems I must give a speech or two.
That is what we've come to hear.
Why, look.
It's Dr Thorne.
- This is good of you.
- No, I thought I owed it to Sir Roger to witness his folly.
Well, stay and hear Moffatt speak.
He's trembling like jelly.
Miss Dunstable, may I present Dr Thorne.
But I know all about you.
Tell me, how is your charming niece?
Mary is well.
She'd be surprised to find herself the topic of your conversation.
I'm an American, Dr Thorne.
We know no boundaries.
Mr Moffatt, it's time.
Is it, really?
Oh, my God, is it, really?
- And where is your opponent?
- Old Scatcherd?
- I very much doubt he's been able to leave his bed.
- I pray he has not.
Now, this Moffatt?
Mr Moffat. 'Ey, there he is, there, look!
And what has he ever done for us, eh?
Nothing, right?
Now, listen, I know I may not look much like this picture that they've drawn of me.
Eh?
But next to that fat pimply item of unearned income,
- who drove down here, by the way, in a carriage...
- Ooh!
.. with a smattering of lords and ladies,
I mean, compared to him, I think I look all right, don't I, eh?
Ha ha ha!
- We know you, Sir Roger!
You're one of us!
- I am, indeed!
You know why?
I came up the hard way.
Didn't I?
Eh?
I may be a rich man now, I may be a baronet, but... but when I started out,
I had nowt but a raw potato in my pocket to gnaw on if the hunger got too bad.
So don't don't let him tell you that I don't know what it's like to be without!
Right?
Thank you!
This is your moment, Mr Moffat.
It's time to deliver your speech.
Good luck.
I am a thoroughpaced reformer.
- You what?
- A thoroughpaced reformer.
- Go on, Snip!
We've got the point!
I believe very firmly in reform.
Drat your reform, Snippy!
For what nation can pride themselves more on the rights granted to their citizens?
The right to chuck this!
Poor Mr Moffatt.
He isn't making much of a mark.
He should have spent more time with the voters.
He should have spent more money ON the voters.
Do you doubt our English democracy?
Say something about their daughters.
Praise their wives.
Praise the town.
Barchester's a fine town, but even a fine town can improve with reform.
I rest my case.
It is time to build on the great achievements and push further along the road to freedom!
Tom!
Tom!
The tailor's son, Stole a pig and away he ran!
Eh?
Look at the pampered swine!
You couldn't fight for a pate sandwich, never mind for a working man's vote!
Right?
- Oh!
Ahh!
- Oh, dear.
Up.
Up!
- Mr Gresham.
- Mr Gresham?
How nice to see you.
It's nice to see you too, Mary.
But I mustn't disturb you at this hour.
- Is your uncle at home?
- Not yet.
He went to the election and hasn't been back since.
Mary, now that I'm here, can I say how sorry I am for all this... difficulty?
It can't be helped, sir.
I hate to think that we've banished you.
Beatrice is hardly speaking to us.
I must love her for that.
Is it true she is engaged to Mr Oriel?
It is.
It seems quick to me, but they're very determined.
- You know Beatrice.
- I certainly do.
There's a servant here from Boxall Hill, Miss Mary.
He says Sir Roger's been struck down.
The doctor's with him now and he's sent a list of things he needs.
I'll come at once.
And ask Thomas to saddle my pony.
I must go.
I'm in the way.
Please, do let me know the news of Sir Roger.
Why have you come?
I couldn't leave Lady Scatcherd to face this with no woman to lean on.
- She has her servants.
- Would you like her to leave me to the servants in such a case?
Here are the things you've asked for.
What can I do?
Bring me a kettle of hot water, a glass and a spoon.
Is that your niece, Thorne?
I don't believe I've ever seen her before.
- She's come to help Lady Scatcherd.
- Oh.
Has Louis arrived yet?
His train must be in.
He won't be long.
I'm sure of it.
Thank you.
To be beaten by four votes seems very harsh.
There'll be a rematch before too long.
Sir Roger did not look as if he would ever make it to Parliament.
- Would you run again, Moffatt?
- I think not.
- How do you do?
- Hm.
Ugh.
Miss Dunstable leaves in the morning.
It must be tonight.
- But, aunt --
- Frank, do not let me down.
I have promised your Mama your family is saved.
Isn't that what you want?
- Of course.
- Then, into the breach with you.
Just as soon as that tiresome young man relinquishes her.
These people!
They accuse us of toadying, but it seems to me they are the toadies.
Oh?
Have I been accused of toadying?
You know what I mean.
Miss Gresham wishes to live well on my fortune.
Her brother aims to buy back his estate with yours.
That has put me in my place.
Why don't you and I join forces?
We could make a noise, and no mistake.
Oh, you've cheered me up, Mr Moffatt.
I have refused Lord Porlock, but one proposal seemed a poor return for a whole week in the country.
Now at least I can claim two.
- Two refusals?
- I'm afraid so.
But be honest, Mr Moffatt.
You want their breeding as much as they want your money.
- And you don't?
- No.
I'd like a man who thinks like a gentleman, but whether he is one or not doesn't matter much to me.
There is your moment.
- You!
Where are they?
- Upstairs, Sir Louis.
In Sir Roger's room.
You look too fine for this kind of work as this, young lady.
Louis!
Oh, is it really you?
Now, steady on, old girl!
Don't squeeze me to death, or else you'll have no-one left to keep you company.
It is good of you to come.
It's wonderful to see you.
I say.
That looks pretty scrappy, guvnor.
Wouldn't you rather have something stronger?
I would, Louis, boy.
Fetch him some brandy.
I've a bottle with me if there's none here.
Sshh!
What difference can it make now, eh?
True enough, I suppose.
Give me some while you're at it.
The nursing standard's gone up.
Miss Thorne is the doctor's niece.
- Come to help me.
- That's good of you.
Can you stay?
Very well.
If I'm not in the way.
I doubt you could ever be in the way.
What did old Moffatt want?
He was curious about my marriage intentions.
- Do you have any?
- No immediate ones.
You see, Mr Gresham, I would rather be courted as a woman than a bank account.
I don't blame you.
Although my aunt will be furious.
She's set on our union.
She thinks I'm proposing now.
And will you propose?
I like you much better than I thought I would.
And I would love to save Greshamsbury.
And if I were not too old for you, and if your heart were not already taken, and if, and if, and if...
What shall I say?
Say you proposed and I refused.
She can't argue with that.
But do not propose.
To me or anyone else but Miss Thorne.
I fear I may be avoiding my duty.
That is noble, but wrong.
Your duty is to your Queen and your God, I hope, but not to keeping your family in luxury.
Your back is straight, your arms are strong.
Make what you can of your life, for yourself and Miss Thorne.
We are the last ones downstairs.
How pleased you will be to be rid of us all in the morning.
Not at all.
We're hoping to see a great deal more of you.
If only that could be.
Goodnight, Lady De Courcy.
And thank you.
What did she mean?
Only that Greshamsbury will not be saved by the gold from the oil of Lebanon.
Thorne.
Can I help you, Scatcherd?
You know what I told you about the will?
I do, and it troubles me that you have not altered it, if you've done something you don't want to do.
I have altered it.
I've added a letter, what you call a codicil... .. saying you, and only you, know the name of Anne's eldest child.
I wish.
I wish.
- Never mind.
- What?
What do you wish?
That I could have met her once before I die.
That is all.
The innocent girl that I made fatherless.
Would it mean so very much?
I think it would give me the strength to face what is coming, and go on my way without regret.
Very well.
I will grant your wish.
What?
She is there.
In the firelight.
Mary Thorne.
That is daughter of Anne Scatcherd.
What?
Is this the truth?
But...
Miss Thorne!
Can I do something for you?
You can cheer me with your lovely face.
- And so you have done.
- If only every patient could be mended so easily.
Would you accept the thanks of a dying man?
I thank you, Thorne.
You brought an angel into this house... .. to make it easier for me to face what lies beyond the grave.
Go to sleep now, Scatcherd.
What a Sleeping Beauty scene is this?
How's the guvnor?
Come, Lady Scatcherd.
You were with him to the last.
That is the best a wife can hope for.
Mary, take Lady Scatcherd to her room.
So, Louis, although you are now the baronet, your father spoke of you to me and... has left you... under my charge.
I hope you will remember you can always turn to me for comfort in your sorrow at his end.
Oh, don't worry about me, Doctor.
I have lived my whole life in the shadow of a great tree and now that tree has fallen.
Maybe it's my time in the sun at last.
- Can you stay here for your mother?
- Certainly not.
I will go to London from the funeral.
You may send whatever money is due to me there.
Gus?
Whatever is the matter?
He's gone.
He left this for me.
The very devil!
How dare he say you did not love him?
Did you love him?
Well, whether I did or not, it isn't very gentlemanly to say so.
Gentlemanly?
There is nothing gentlemanly about him.
Moffat!
- Where is that devil Moffat?
- He left straight after breakfast.
Take my advice and let him go.
She's better off without him.
I'm back, Mama.
Come in.
Did you have a nice time at the Oriels, my dear?
Caleb came in and we all had tea.
- Ah.
- You may call him Caleb to us, and, of course, when you're alone together, but don't use his name too freely.
No, Mama.
Who else was there?
Mary was with us.
- Mary Thorne?
- She'd come in from Boxall Hill.
We hadn't seen each other since my engagement, so Patience invited her.
Patience Oriel may ask whom she pleases to the Rectory.
But you must support your brother.
- Surely, when I'm Mrs Oriel.
- When you're married you may do as you wish, but you are not married yet.
- Did she talk of Frank?
- Yes.
Does he write to her?
No, he does not, nor she to him.
You wrong Mary, Mama.
I'm going up to change.
Little minx.
- Beatrice?
- Mary Thorne!
Oh, good afternoon, Lady Arabella.
- Is Dr Thorne at home?
- Yes, he is.
I'll show you through.
My Lady Arabella Gresham.
This is an honour, Lady Arabella.
You're aware that Mary was this afternoon having tea with Beatrice and Miss Oriel?
I do not believe I've congratulated you on Beatrice's engagement.
You see, I must take you into my confidence, Dr Thorne.
You know very well how I worry about Frank.
You are his mother.
And we have all, with your assistance, contrived to separate him from dear Mary.
With my assistance?
I have given no such assistance!
Nor will I!
Well, in sending her to stay with Lady Scatcherd, you agreed it were better they were kept apart.
I did not agree.
All I am saying is that I must do my duty by my own children.
- Of course you must.
- And therefore I have called to say
I think it imprudent for Beatrice and Mary to spend time together.
You expect me now to disapprove of Mary's friendship with Beatrice?
I am very fond of Beatrice.
I like their friendship.
I am glad of it.
Suppose it should lead to renewed familiarity between Frank and Mary?
I will say only this.
If you wish to put a stop to their intimacy, then tell Frank, not me.
And cease your persecution of Mary!
Persecution?
!
When I have received her all her life as if she were my own daughter?
Until it pleased you not to do so!
You forget yourself!
Good day, Dr Thorne.
Good day, Lady Arabella.
I've asked them to bring the horse round.
Though I know Louis will want something more handsome for you.
Don't listen to him.
I love Firebird.
Riding him is a gentle thing.
But I'm afraid I've put you to a great deal of trouble.
Not at all.
You've helped me more than I can say over these past weeks.
I've grown used to having you with me.
It's time you went back to your own life.
- Lady Scatcherd!
- Louis's back.
I wasn't expecting him.
Oh, don't tell me she's putting you up on that damn thing again!
And I am very happy that she has.
For a person who rides like you, Miss Thorne!
For such a horsewoman!
Lady Scatcherd, it's ridiculous!
Don't talk so, Sir Louis, when I am perfectly content.
Well, I call it a crime against nature!
Why, properly mounted, I'd back you against anything in Hyde Park!
Joe!
This is Jonah, my new man.
Every gentleman should have a man.
- Joe!
It's empty!
- Right you are, Sir Louis, sir.
I'm sorry.
I can't seem to keep this steed still around your sorry excuse for a horse.
You mustn't abuse my pet, but, please, give your horse its head.
A damn shame!
Should you not have gone to your parents first with this news?
No.
Because I believe it rests with you as to what I tell them.
Surely not.
Mary is owed a word on the matter, and so are they, but I've no part to play.
Would you object to me as a suitor?
Frank, you must consider carefully.
You are a fine fellow and any young woman would be lucky to have you.
Well, then.
It is not as simple as that.
Greshamsbury has been your family seat for centuries.
It would pain your father deeply, were he to be the Gresham to lose it.
You would have me follow my aunt's advice and marry Miss Dunstable.
Not if you don't care for her.
As a matter of fact I like her very much,
- but as a friend.
- Not her, then.
Believe me, it costs me nothing to disagree with Lady De Courcy on any given topic.
Do you object to me personally?
I would be proud to call you nephew, but I beg you, consider your parents and what it means to them.
I am too far in, Doctor.
My mother asked me not to see Mary and I have kept to that, but it has altered nothing.
Before you speak out, there is something you should know.
It will not change my mind.
Possibly not, but you should know it, all the same.
You have always heard that Mary is my niece.
And so she is my brother's daughter.
But not quite according to the laws that normally govern these things.
Go on.
Forgive me, it is hard to go on.
For when I do, I think I must destroy the happiness of one I love more than my life.
Well, surely, the truth can't be so very bad, sir.
It is bad enough, by heaven.
A Mr Mortimer Gazebee.
Dawson, would you please send word to Mr Gresham?
You must be Miss Gresham and Miss Beatrice.
You've done your homework.
I think you know my uncle, Lord De Courcy.
I am here as a lawyer on his recommendation.
He told me Greshamsbury Park was a fine place, but it is even finer than he led me to believe.
- The question is, can it be saved?
- Beatrice, please.
How can we be helpful, Mr Gazebee?
Would it be useful if I show you the gardens while we wait for Papa?
- Nothing could be more so.
- Good.
- Beatrice will tell him what we're up to.
- I certainly will.
Shall we go?
Lord De Courcy thinks I may be helpful.
Poor Papa will be grateful for any help that he can get.
Lady Scatcherd.
You've caught me unprepared, Doctor.
- Let me see what I can offer you.
- Stay where you are.
I had a message from your son.
How is he?
If he's still drinking too much,
- you must exert your influence.
- Oh, Doctor.
You have more say with him than I.
And Miss Thorne more than either of us.
You cut a fine figure, Miss Thorne.
I hope that means you'll be kinder about my trusty steed.
It's true, I'm a good judge of horseflesh.
Nobody knows more about it than I.
I believe you.
Nobody knows more about women, either.
You will make me blush, Sir Louis.
Mary is a wonderful influence.
But?
I think she should go home.
It's time.
- Doctor?
- No.
Sir Louis, I wish I could persuade you to drink a little less.
I'll give it thought, Doctor.
- Now, the Greshamsbury title deeds.
- You mustn't worry about that.
Your lawyers know all there is to know.
It's what my lawyers tell me that brings me here.
See, I gather I've more £90,000 tied up in the Greshamsbury estate.
Something of that kind.
The estate is a fine one.
There is no risk.
- What if I need the money?
- But you don't.
Everyone needs money, Doctor.
You shall control everything in a short while, Sir Louis, and until then, I shall see that you are amply provided for.
And if I've a mind to live there?
Perhaps, but I should have thought it rather large for a bachelor.
Should you, indeed?
Now, Doctor, what would you think of my getting married?
I should be delighted.
It was your father's dearest wish that you should marry soon and well.
As to that, I do not think you will quarrel with my choice.
What would you say to Miss Mary Thorne?
Well?
Wouldn't she be a good wife?
Have you spoken to her?
Yes and no.
I've not exactly popped it to her, but I've been doing the civil and if she's up to snuff, she'll know very well what I'm after.
Well, Sir Louis, you do Mary a great honour, of course, but might it not be sensible to wait until you know each other a little better?
But you don't disapprove?
I disapprove only of hasty choices.
Whether we talk of Greshamsbury or my niece,
I know my advice is only binding on you for a little while longer, but I urge it just the same.
With your permission, I will study the estate in detail.
There may be sources of income as yet untapped.
They'd need to be very lucrative.
Or perhaps a new system of repayment
- that would keep Sir Louis content for a few years.
- I doubt it.
I believe his man of business is an honourable fellow --
That is a matter of opinion!
He is the soul of honour and will do what he can, but when Sir Louis takes possession, that may not be much.
They say Sir Louis drinks heavily.
Not heavily enough.
Sir Louis is a strong man, Mr Gazebee.
He may drink too much, but he's not going anywhere.
Still, we have room for manoeuvre.
Frank?
What are you doing here?
I didn't expect to see you before the end of term.
I have business to discuss with you, but it can wait.
No need.
With your permission, Lady Arabella,
I will re-join you the day after tomorrow.
We will be delighted to see you.
I should have introduced you.
Mr Gazebee has come to advise us --
As to whether there is any way to rescue the estate.
Are you leaving, Mr Gazebee?
Have they ordered you a carriage?
I think I'll walk.
It's a nice day and the country air is sweet after the soot of London.
You make me quite envious.
I would ask you to accompany me if it were not impertinent.
I should like to learn more about Greshamsbury.
I'll come if it would be useful.
- Will you wait while I fetch a coat?
- Of course.
Leaving, Mr Gazebee?
When will we see you again?
I shall be back on Thursday.
In the meantime, Miss Gresham will walk me to the station.
So that I can learn more of the estate and its dependents.
What a tireless worker she is.
Shall we go?
Perhaps Miss Beatrice would like to accompany us?
I don't think so.
Nobody knows more about the village than Augusta.
- Thank you.
- Good day.
You intend to do what?
To go to Boxall Hill and ask for Mary's hand in marriage.
Oh, Frank.
Frank, she has done all she could to catch you!
Mother, you wrong her cruelly!
You wicked boy!
To call me cruel!
When you know what we need to survive!
I shall hate Greshamsbury if I hear one more word of what I have to do to save it!
So instead you'll see us turned out to beg our bread by the roadside.
It has not quite come to that.
Oh, Frank, do you wish me to die of a broken heart?
Mother, I'd love you to be happy.
If you wish to see me happy ever again, marry money!
No!
I'd have made a fool of myself if it had not been for Miss Dunstable's good taste, and I will not do it again!
Which makes you an ungrateful and unnatural child!
- Mother --
- Out of my way!
This is not sensible, Frank.
And there is more.
Mary may not know it, but her birth is unsuited to your wife and the mother of your children.
So Dr Thorne told me when I went to him this afternoon.
But it makes no difference?
Should it?
I don't recall much talk of Moffatt's birth or Miss Dunstable's.
What else did Thorne say?
He told me to consider it carefully... .. and talk it over with you and my mother before I gave Mary my word.
Did he, indeed?
Well, I should have expected no less of him.
Very well.
But how do you mean to support her?
By working.
Many men do.
Then finish the year at Cambridge, for my sake.
- Take your degree.
- I will speak to Mary.
- I can manage this, my dear.
- I like to help.
It must be hard for you.
But these clothes will be a blessing to some poor families.
What are you doing in my room?
We're sorting your late father's clothes to give to the poor.
Burn them, for all I care.
You don't mean that.
I mean everything I say.
Just as I mean for you to let Miss Thorne and I have a moment together.
- But, Sir Louis --
- Go, please, Lady Scatcherd.
We shouldn't be alone together, Sir Louis.
It is not quite right.
But you see, Miss Thorne, I think it is exactly right.
I want us to be alone together for... the rest of our lives.
If you take my meaning.
Sir Louis, of course, I'm flattered.
Don't say "flattered".
Say...
Say "delighted".
But I'm afraid things can never be as you wish.
- Why not?
Are you engaged elsewhere?
- No.
But I'm not free.
You have led me on, Miss Thorne.
You have led me on most wickedly!
He has fallen victim to her wiles.
What is the point of talking like that, Mama?
You think everything is lost, then?
Do I think Frank will be true to Mary Thorne?
Yes, I do.
And I love him for it.
Well, I do not love him for it.
And I will not quit the field quite yet.
Master Frank!
Oh, Master Frank!
Ohh!
Let me kiss your naughty little face!
You're a sight for sore eyes, you are!
And Lord knows my eyes have been sore since I last saw you!
- Ohh!
Ohh!
- But, Lady Scatcherd, what will they say?
You forget I am a man now.
Not to me, Master Frank!
You may think what you like, you'll always be my little Master Frank!
Lady Scatcherd, you forget yourself.
Let Mr Gresham breathe.
You know I nursed Master Frank when he was a boy, Louis.
I seem to recall something of the sort, but you are Lady Scatcherd now.
All that is behind you.
It may be, but at the time we were kept alive by the charity of Master Frank's parents.
Without the home and wage they offered me,
I don't know how we'd have managed, we two.
Oh, really?
Where was the guvnor?
Your father was... away for some years.
He would have liked to have come home, but he could not.
I'm very grateful to Lady Scatcherd for remembering me.
As if I could forget!
Oh.
Look at your hair.
How dark you are.
Oh!
But it doesn't curl the way it used to.
Enough, Lady Scatcherd!
Enough!
I have come to see Miss Thorne, Sir Louis.
Oh, she's out riding.
Go straight ahead from the front door and follow that path.
You'll see her.
What does he want with her?
Oh, they're old friends, the Greshams and the Thornes.
But we Scatcherds are not old friends of the Greshams, are we?
What's got into you, Louis?
I'll make them wish they had been more courteous to the Scatcherds.
What has Master Frank ever done to harm you?
You fool!
He is doing it now!
Mr Gresham.
Ahem.
Yes, it is me, Mary.
I've come to pay my respects.
You must have thought me uncivil to stay away for so long.
Not at all.
I didn't even know you were back in Greshamsbury.
And I came to Boxall to be out of the way.
Why should you want to be out of the way?
I had my reasons.
Have you had news of me?
I have.
But I've been taken up with Lady Scatcherd's business, dealing with Sir Roger's death.
I've had no time to think of myself.
When have you ever thought of yourself?
I feel so high up, here.
Will you help me down?
Ahem.
Yes.
Mary... .. do you remember when we were last together?
I remember you were very foolish.
Then I've come to repeat my folly.
For all the months we've been apart, nothing has altered me.
Mr Gresham, there are many reasons why I am not worthy of you.
- If you knew them all --
- I do.
Or at least I know what you think I am ignorant of.
Your uncle told me all about your birth.
That is why you must not think ill of your mother for opposing me.
Any mother would have done the same.
Mary, if you'll tell me that I'm nothing to you, then I'll go away and I'll leave you in peace and my mother may be easy.
Just say the words...
"You do not love me."
"You cannot love me." And I will be gone.
Then, Mary... darling Mary, will you please be my own wife?
For the truth of it is simple;
I love you with my whole heart.
Oh, Frank.
We're looking for Lady Scatcherd.
She's only stepped out for a moment, Miss Thorne.
I'll tell Her Ladyship you're waiting for her.
- Is this her sitting room?
- It is.
The only place she was ever allowed her own way, poor thing.
Now, when you break the news to your father, you must also tell him that you will take your degree, whatever happens.
He thought you would say that.
Mr Gresham and I are old friends.
We always understand each other.
Will you honour us with your presence at dinner, Mr Gresham?
You're very kind, Sir Louis, but I have to get back.
What about you, Miss Thorne?
Will you be joining us, my mother and I?
Might I be excused?
I'm tired, so I'll ask for a tray in my room.
- I've still some packing left to do.
- Oh.
I don't think I can allow that.
Not on...
Not on your last night at Boxall Hill.
You may have to.
Careful, Mr Gresham, we are not at Greshamsbury now.
I give the orders at Boxall Hill.
No-one gives orders to Miss Thorne, not at Boxall Hill or Greshamsbury.
I should like to know Greshamsbury better.
I have an interest in the place, you know.
Yes...
I do know.
Oh, I'm sorry to have kept you.
Oh, but you're not going?
I'm afraid I must, Lady Scatcherd.
Goodbye, Mary.
I'll see you when you get home.
Sir Louis.
You've frightened him off, Louis.
Now let's go upstairs, Miss Thorne, and I'll help you pack.
He'll be a lot less cocky when you boot him out, Sir Louis.
When he's left on the roadside outside his own gates, begging for a bit of crust.
You're right, Joe.
He'll be much less cocky then.
Not bad.
For a newb.
Cheat!
You're a stuck pig, lad.
Rude.
Come on.
On your feet.
Look, am I here for a reason?
As you know... ..I am your spirit guide.
And although the ancient laws prohibit Sean Bean from interfering in the affairs of men... ..I've laid on a treat for you.
Call it an early birthday present.
Are we going to Comic-Con together?
I'm not going to Comic-Con, we'll get fucking mobbed!
No.
It's time you took a wench to the barn.
Sorry, what?
You know, put your custard in the pudding.
Stew your mutton.
Are these metaphors?
Pounce a peacock.
Right, you're just saying words now.
Look... it's time you lost your virginity, lad.
I had sex with Angelique on my French exchange.
Sheathe your sword.
Right, there you go again.
I mean, do you mean that literally, or is that another dig?
I don't know - both.
Oh, Skyscanner's got a flight to South Korea.
Is that the dictator one?
Gangnam Style one.
Oh, I like that video.
Maybe I'll go to South Korea.
You think you'll make it, though?
I mean, you didn't make it to India.
Or London.
Or the Co-op.
So, I was supposed to go to this sex party with a holy man and this girl we met on Snapchat, but she can't make it because she's pregnant and she doesn't want to run into any of the "dads",
so there's a spare ticket and we thought...
Morph, early birthday present?
ANGELIC CHORUS
Early birthday present.
Good way to lose your V plates.
Alison
- Angelique, French exchange.
Right, so we're all still...
That's still open?
I will come to this party to continue my adult sexual adventure.
Sorted.
So what is this sex party?
Big mansion, guest-list only, anyone can have sex with anyone.
Anyone?
Anyone.
ANGELIC CHORUS
I would have invited everyone, but obviously thought that would be weird for...
Pfft!
Pfft!
Pfft!
Pfft!
Pfft!
THEY GUFFAW
Why would that be weird?
Well, because, you two...
Yeah, but it didn't mean anything.
And Kent went straight to Bristol after, so...
Yeah, and Sarah didn't even stop me, or try and call me for a year, so...
OK, so, not weird at all.
Might be weird for him.
Might be weird for her.
OK, I'll get the holy man to put you on the guest list.
Here's a picture of Angelique.
That's just an image search.
For sexy French girl.
Yeah, and she came up first, so...
Gorgeous.
Yeah.
So, what do we wear to a sex party anyway?
Fucking hell!
OK.
Next stop, sex party!
Before we set off - ground rules.
What, like no kissing on the mouth?
Mate, it's not Pretty Woman.
Oh, so you have seen Pretty Woman, Kent?
Fuck!
How about, between us, no direct contact?
Let's say indirect contact only.
Like contact through another person.
Shall we say two people?
Yeah.
That seems logical, yeah.
And whatever happens in there, we never talk about it again, ever.
Like if someone walks in, and I'm wearing a strap-on pegging some dude, you can't rag on me about it for ever.
You're into pegging?
No, I was just using that as an example.
It came to you pretty quick, though, didn't it?
Oh, I've got one.
I don't want to see anyone's O face.
That goes without saying.
What if it happens by accident, Alison?
Erm...
Right, another rule - you and me, never in the same room.
If I were you... ..I'd steer clear of room 42.
Why?
What happens in room 42?
You come face-to-face with who you really are.
Condoms.
Femidoms.
Covering all the angles.
Protein bars.
For recovery.
Verruca sock?
In case there's a wet room.
Four cans of energy drink.
I don't know how long it's going to be.
Sudoku?
There might be a waiting area.
Why do you have a knife?
For the, er, oysters.
Behave yourself.
Fine.
This is just his ticket printed out again.
Oh, what, does that not work...?
Of course that doesn't fucking work!
For fuck's sake!
I was really looking forward to having sex with all them strangers.
Not as much as I was.
Or with as many of them.
I'll handle this.
Hey, let them in.
I'm not going into a sex party without my sister.
Mate, just go in.
This is weird.
Well, I bet you're bloody relieved.
What are you talking about?
Well, it works out well for you, doesn't it?
You get to say you're going to do something and then don't actually do it.
Like...
India.
Kent, India and group sex are completely different.
Not according to my uncle.
If I'd have gone in there,
I would have had the biggest fucking orgy of my life, and you'd have bottled it.
No, I would have marched right into the middle of that orgy and fucking nailed it.
Ha!
Bullshit!
Kent, what do you want me to do, you want me to break in and prove it?
What are you doing?
I'm wiping for fingerprints.
What?
In case the sex police come?
Hello?
Hello?
I need some help, can you let me out?
Fucking hell!
I think I've been forgotten about.
Can you let me out?
Yeah, sure.
Don't fucking do it!
Huh?
It's part of the game.
I'm pleading.
All right, then, bye.
That's it.
Can you leave the doors open, please?
What are you fucking doing?
Fuck's sake!
OK, last chance to back out.
I'm not backing out.
Unless you're backing out.
I'm not backing out.
Yeah, good, co I'm not either.
I'm getting some sex.
Yeah, me too.
(Good.)

Well, that's why you're here, isn't it?

I need to tell you something.
It concerns my virginity, and it may come as a bit of a shock.
What, you have lost it?
No, I'm saying I haven't.
No.
No!
Shut the front door!
I did not expect that.
Because it was a very well constructed lie, and I'm sorry for deceiving you so expertly.
But what about Angelique?
I'm sorry to say, I made her up.
But what about all those e-mails you've been showing us for the past eight years?
Fake.
I hoodwinked you all.
But that would mean you'd have to set up a fake e-mail address, send yourself e-mails, then reply to yourself over and over again for eight years.
Which is why you were all so convinced.
And I feel bad about it.
I don't think you need to, mate.
The truth is...
I've never given away my flower... ..because I wanted my first time to be with someone special.
Maybe I can help with that.

We know you don't want us to untie you.
I know I said that.
But that was an hour ago.
It's really cutting off my circulation.
He's quite convincing, isn't he?
You're overthinking this.
We just need to get you shagged.

If it pleases.
Sorry, we are in process.
I can't let you in at this time.
Or you, ever.
Fair enough, yeah.
Room 42 adheres to a strict set of rules that we take very seriously.
THEY SNIGGER
Are you laughing at my...penis?
No.
No.
What about my penis do you find funny?
I mean, it's disproportionately large for your frame.
It kind of waggles up and down when you tell us off.
And it is a bit of a horse cock, mate.
Right, so we're playing silly buggers, are we?
Please leave or I'll be forced to call the dungeon Master.
All right, listen, Voldermort, we're not in fucking Hogwarts, right.
We're ten minutes outside of Yeovil, so can you please open that fucking door?
Where's your wristband?
Spliff?
Spliff.
Feels nice.
Good.
I should probably tell you, it's my first time.
Mine too.
GONG STRIKES
They're pretty synchronised.
Ssh!
Sorry.
So, what happens next?
Kneel down with me.
Close your eyes.
OK.
And also your mouth.
What?
Argh!
No, no, no, no!
Argh!
Argh!
Argh!
Hey, be honest.
Do you think if you stayed in there, you'd've actually had sex?
I want to say no, but I haven't had a shag in fucking ages.
Maybe if there were more drink tokens.
Oh, right, so you didn't have sex with dread head?
Only petting.
What about the bat man?
Nah, but that might be because I stabbed him.
It's been pretty dry too, for me, to be fair.
Since I got back.
But there were loads of girls in Brazil, right?
Nada.
I don't think I've had sex since...
Me too.
Kent...
Yeah.
Is that man wanking?
Mr Rogerson!
Kent Blackwell, how are you keeping?
Oi!
Shoo!
Get out of it.
What the fuck happened to you?
I don't want to talk about it.
Morpheus got pissed on.
Oh, so we're just talking about it, are we?
You got off lightly, mate.
When I was in room 42...
I'm going to go back in.
Open the gates!
At least you can save it for someone special.
Mate, put a towel down.
I didn't bring a towel.
You brought fucking oysters!
There's one in the boot.
Me again.
Argh!
Well, you win some, you lose some.
Is that all you've got to say about it?
You do know six men pissed on me, right?
Maybe there's a lesson in it.
What?
I don't know.
Be yourself?
Is that the best you've got?
You laid this on for me.
I thought you had a plan, Sean.
I'm managing it from a distance, I don't have boots on the ground.
And remember...
I'm just your subconscious.
You've got to take some responsibility.
No.
Actually, I think you've got to take some responsibility.
You what?
You've been a shit spirit guide.
Now it's time I killed you.
Killed me?
Come on, Sean Bean.
You die in everything.
Yeah.
Fair enough.
Morpheus.
Yes.
Make it a clean strike.
I'll try my best.
But it's my first time, so...
You'll do fine.
CLANG
Ah!
Sean Bean?
I just killed you.
One does not simply kill Sean Bean.
Oh, my God.
Best day ever!

KIM:
All right.
Here he is.
HOWARD:
Oh, great.
Jimmy, right on time.
Good to see you.
Hello, Howard.
Hey.
Hi.
James McGill, Clifford Main.
Just "Jimmy." And it's a pleasure to meet you, Clifford.
Likewise.
We know all about your work on Sandpiper.
Well, it's a group effort.
I mean, the folks at HHM are just knockin' it out of the park.
Well, we know the case wouldn't exist without you.
Absolutely.
Once you get him on your team, you'll know why I call him "Charlie Hustle."
Jimmy, these are my associates, Brian Archuleta, and Erin Brill.
Hello.
Nice to meet you both.
It's great to meet you.
I hate to do this, but could I borrow Ms. Wexler for a moment?
If you will excuse us?
(CLEARS THROAT) Pardon me.
(CHUCKLES)
What's going on?
I just... (CLEARS THROAT) Listen, here's the thing.
If I take this job, does that mean the two of us...
I mean...
Uh, does it mean...
What?
What the hell is this?
If I take this job today, with Davis and Main, does that mean that you and me...
Is this, is this gonna happen?
Jimmy.
I...
I... (SIGHS)
One thing has absolutely nothing to do with the other.
Nothing at all.
No.
Of course not.
Why would it?
Great. (SIGHS)
Uh...
Sorry about that.
Listen, I just want to say thank you, sincerely, for your interest in me.
It's an honor to be considered, but at this time...
At this time, um,
I'm gonna have to take myself out of the running.
Thanks.
Thank you, Howard.
Uh, Jimmy?
MIKE:
Well, that was quick.
No charge.
Help me out here.
Did I dream it, or did I have $1,600,000 on my desk, in cash?
No one on God's green Earth knew we had it.
We could've split it 50-50.
We could've gone home with $800,000 each.
Tax-free.
Your point being?
Why didn't we?
I remember you saying something about doing the right thing.
You want to know why I didn't take that money?
Is that what you're asking?
Yeah, that's what I'm asking.
Me, personally, I was hired to do a job.
I did it.
That's as far as it goes.
Yeah.
Well, I know what stopped me.
And you know what?
It's never stopping me again.
(TIRES SQUEALING)

Mrs. Nguyen, it's a beautiful day out there.
You should get out of this place once in a while.
You know, throw a Frisbee, have some fun.
I have a business to run.
Uh, no.
The business is running you.
Listen to me.
You'll thank me later.

It's me.
Hello?
Hello?
It's me.
I got a new car.
You like it?
We're not taking that to the meet.
How are we gonna get there?
I'll drive.
My car.
Why?
This business requires restraint.
That is the opposite of restraint.
But I like it.
I mean, I'm proud of it.
Good.
Then you be proud of it on your own time, but not with me.
I'm not getting in that.
Okay.
Then don't.
Honestly, you don't really do anything.
I've been paying you the salary of three people to just stand behind me.
You know?
And these last few deals...
This Nacho fella, he's been comin' alone.
I mean, if he doesn't need backup men, then, I mean, why do I need you?
I should just go alone.
I'm throwing...
I'm throwing away money.
Just tossing it away into the trash.
Look, you do whatever you want, but I'm advising you, do not go to that meet without someone watching your back.
Yeah, well, of course you're gonna say that.
I mean, you don't want to be out of this easy-peasy job.
Well, I'm sorry, but this is the gravy train, and it's leaving the station right now.
So, last chance.
All aboard.
Seriously, last chance.
I'm gonna count to, say, 10, and then I'm...
All right, then.
Your services are no longer needed.
(VEHICLE APPROACHING)
Hola.
No old guy?
What, did he break a hip or something?
(CHUCKLES) I know, right?
Yeah, no, we...
We parted ways.
Yeah, saw things differently.
So...
You know how it is.
This is interesting.
Oh, yeah.
You like it?
Can I take a look?
Oh, be my guest.
Get in.
(CHUCKLES) Check it out.
Wow.
Impressive.
PRYCE:
Thank you.
Get in.
Feel the leather.
Yeah, it's a H2.
Brand-new, off the line.
Slimmer than the H1, but longer, more height.
Yeah, it's a honey.
V8 engine, 325 horsepower, tri-zone climate controls.
So, you can have a girl in a bikini and another in a parka, and they're both gonna be comfortable.
(LAUGHING)
You're running around with two girls in your SUV?
You'd be really comfortable, huh?
Oh, yeah.
Yes.
(CHUCKLES)
I'm gonna count this quick.
Do your thing.
Make sure it's right.
PRYCE:
Okey-dokey.
We are good.
Uh, same as before.
Still factory-sealed.
And, as always, you're welcome to count 'em.
I trust you.
Great.
Thank you.
See you next time.
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
Hello?
Yes.
No.
Sorry.
Uh...
Yes, this is James McGill, but I'm no longer a lawyer, so...
That's right, not a lawyer.
Bye.
(SIGHS)
So, this is what a midlife crisis looks like?
Not midlife crisis.
Clarity.
Midlife clarity.
Clarity?
Uh...
Clearly explain to me why you walked out on the best job opportunity of your life.
(SIGHS)
Get in the pool, and I'll tell ya.
Get in the pool?
(CHUCKLES) Yeah.
Come on.
Just pop in the gift shop and buy a bathing suit.
Get a one-piece, nothing fancy.
The water is perfect.
It's 82 degrees.
You can order a drink.
And you got to try this crab dip...
Why are you acting like this?
I'm not acting like anything.
I just finally decided to be me.
Everything okay, Mr. Cumpston?
Would you like another drink?
No, I'm good with this.
I'll tell you what, Mr. Cumpston.
If you really want to talk, I'll be in the bar.
Not for long.
Hey, Rolando.
Check.
What...
What do you mean, "quit the law"?
I quit it.
Simple as that.
Oh, well, thanks for explaining, Jimmy.
It's super-clear now.
Hey, buddy?
Is that a misprint right there?
It's got to be, right?
The Zafiro Anejo?
Yeah.
That's correct, actually, believe it or not.
Holy shit.
A $50 shot of tequila?
Is it worth it?
Apparently.
I mean, it's kind of a personal choice kind of thing.
Well, I can't die without trying a $50 shot of tequila, so, two, dos, neat.
And we can charge that to the room, can't we?
No, we can't.
We...
I am paying.
And he will be having a shot of your well brand, and I'll have a glass of your house red.
We have a Cabernet, a Pinot, and a Syrah.
Whatever.
Dealer's choice.
Something with alcohol.
You got it.
Jimmy.
Did something happen in Cicero?
Why did something have to happen in Cicero?
Because when I talked to you about Davis and Main, you were ready to take the job.
Now you're back, and you're suddenly quitting the law, cheating hotels out of expensive liquor, wearing a weird pinkie ring?
What, are you in the Mafia now?
Asking if we have a future.
I mean, where did that come from?
I don't know.
I just...
Well, Cicero has nothing to do with it.
It's my whole life.
Well, my life since Chuck made me come to Albuquerque.
Ever since I got here, all I've done is try to make Chuck happy, bend over backwards to please Chuck.
Chuck, Chuck, Chuck.
Well, no more.
You quitting the law, isn't that exactly what Chuck wants?
Who cares?
This is for me, okay?
I got into the law for all the wrong reasons.
I'm trusting my instincts.
I think that my talents are better spent elsewhere.
Where?
Floating in somebody else's pool?
(SCOFFS)
Jimmy, you're a great lawyer.
Why give that up?
I'm not saying it didn't have its moments, but the stuff I liked about it, selling people, convincing people,
I don't have to be a lawyer to do that.
Besides, people tell me how they see me, and it's not as a lawyer.
All right.
Here you go.
KIM:
Thank you.
Let me know if I can get you guys anything else, okay?
KEN:
Bobby, what up, brother man?
KIM:
Thanks.
Short it.
Short it.
Short it.
Short that shit.
That stock is useless.
It's got no legs.
It's like a circus freak minus the fun.
And that one's even worse.
Who's giving you these?
Please do me a favor.
Take a pillow, put it over that stock's face until you hear the deathbed queef.
Okay, so...
If you're not gonna be a lawyer, then what?
Float around and wait for your Sandpiper money to roll in?
No.
That could take years.
Sandpiper has no bearing on this at all.
Okay, then, what's the plan?
To be open to the universe.
Okay, so no plan.
Just walk the Earth, like Jules at the end of Pulp Fiction?
Look, whatever the universe presents, whatever opportunity arises,
I will take it.
Whatever opportunity?
Yeah.
Wasn't Davis and Main an opportunity?
It's a great opportunity, and you're walking away from it.
Look, shouldn't you at least try the job before you say no?
And waste everyone's time, including my own?
Kim, I appreciate your concern, but it's not for me.
I don't want it.
Jimmy, do you remember how long you studied for that bar?
How hard you worked?
Yeah.
All that effort, you're just gonna toss it away?
That's the sunk cost fallacy.
Wait, the what?
The fallacy of sunk cost.
It's what gamblers do.
They throw good money after bad thinking they can turn their luck around.
It's like, "I've already spent this much money or time, whatever.
"I got to keep going."
No, there's no reward at the end of this game.
You are making a mistake.
I know you're making a mistake.
I've been doing the right thing for all these years now, and where has it gotten me?
Nowhere.
I'm sorry.
I don't...
KEN:
It's not my thing.
I don't get it.
I just don't get it.
It's what's right for me.
(KEN LAUGHING) Donkey balls.
Pure donkey balls, dude.
Wall Street's for suckers.
Who needs that aggravation?
If the Oracle doesn't have to live there, then I sure as hell don't.
I can make a million-dollar stock trade on my laptop sitting on a toilet.
Like Midas, shitting gold bricks on my throne.
That's why Speigelman and Deitch want my business so bad.
I'm a golden God.
Look, of course I remember that.
Who forgets a thing like that?
That fart had the anger of a repressed minority community.
You fart like that in someone's face, you're gonna give them pink eye for life.
(KEN LAUGHING)
Good convo, bro.
Till next time, brother man.
Come with me.
What?
Just come on.
Trust me.
What are you gonna do?
You want to understand what I'm talking about?
Follow my lead.
Hey, buddy, could you settle a bet for us?
A what?
Sorry.
I don't want to make it sound like I was eavesdropping, but I kind of was.
We heard you talking about stocks.
Uh-huh.
Yeah, so, a question, if you could settle a debate between me and my sister.
All right.
You know what?
We probably shouldn't even bother this man.
We wouldn't normally do this, right?
But we need an expert.
This guy sounds like he knows his stuff.
Yeah, go.
Okay.
Here's the question.
When it comes to the stock market, is there, like, a financial limit to how much a person's allowed to invest?
A limit?
No.
No limit.
Knew it.
Oh, even if it's an inheritance?
You know, with, like, inheritance taxes and whatnot?
No.
Same.
That's, oh, fantastic.
Thank you, buddy.
See?
No limit.
Told you we could invest it all.
And it's a smart move, too.
Sticking it all in the bank?
No.
Um, yeah.
You can invest all your money.
Just make sure you diversify.
Yeah.
Diversify.
(FLAPS LIPS) That's...
We got to...
Hey, what do you mean, "diversify"?
Well, diversify is...
You know that saying,
"Don't put all your eggs in one basket," right?
Same principle.
No, it makes complete sense.
Thank you.
Now, if I had an idea of the money we're talking about, ballpark,
I could give you examples of smart diversification.
Yeah, um...
Look, an uncle on our father's side recently passed, and he left us somewhere in the neighborhood of $1.4 million.
And I don't mean to be greedy, but I think if we invest it smart now, we could double it, triple it, we could quadruple the whole inheritance, right?
In my opinion?
Fortune favors the bold, man.
Now, if you guys are free to join me for a drink,
I can give you a quick consult.
That's all right.
We were gonna do it ourselves through one of those online brokerage websites.
We're just gonna pick a classic, like,
I think they're called blue-chip stocks?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you can totally do it yourself.
Shoot for the tried and true.
'Course, you might be putting your cash in the Hindenburg, the Andrea Doria, Corky Romano.
Right?
They all seemed rock-solid beforehand, but then...
Yeah, not good.
Not good, yeah.
So, how do you know?
Well, that's where someone like myself comes in.
Proven track record as a wealth manager.
I take calculated but aggressive risks 'cause I want to catch lightning.
And I do.
Practically a money-printing machine.
That sounds good.
A money-printing machine.
Listen, there's a little booth over here.
There's some privacy.
We can talk.
No obligations.
We can just rap about this a little bit.
Yeah, I guess.
Yeah?
What do you say, sis?
Can we just talk?
KEN:
Electric slide on in there.
And we'll just rap a little bit.
It's no...
My name's Ken, by the way.
Uh, Viktor, with a "K."
Cool.
Viktor with a "K."
And this lovely lady is?
It's Giselle.
Giselle Saint Claire.
Ah, lovely.
Please, sit.
I won't bite.
So, Viktor with a "K" and Giselle...
Exotic names.
JIMMY:
They're Dutch.
Well, Boer, to be precise.
Our father's side of the family is from South Africa, which is where Uncle Humphrey passed away.
Oh, South Africa.
They grow them beautiful down there, right?
Charlize Theron.
And you.
Oh, well... (SCOFFS)
I've never actually been, but hope to go someday.
KEN:
Tell you what, by the time I'm done with you two, you might be taking your own private jet.
Nice.
Excuse me.
Hi.
Uh, we are sitting here now, so we could use a wine list, if you get a chance...
Hey, are you a tequila fan?
Yes.
You down for that?
You ever try Zafiro Anejo?
No, I have not, but I'm down for whatever.
Three of whatever she just said.
You got it.
All right.
So, stock market.
A great investment.
And you're picking the right time to jump in.
JIMMY:
Why do you listen to me?
I'm an idiot.
(KEN LAUGHING)
And talks about his cars, talks about...
KEN:
How many cars did he have?
KIM:
I don't think...
(JIMMY LAUGHING)
KIM:
It doesn't make sense.
That's it, Ken.
Oh, yeah.
WAITER:
Compliments of the bartender.
She thought you might want a souvenir.
Oh, my God.
Did we drink the entire bottle?
Not yet, we didn't.
(BOOING) Hey, hey, cheers.
I think we're ready for the check.
(LAUGHING)
(COUGHING)
Oh!
Now, really, it's the smart way to go.
KIM:
Okay.
But, so, to be clear, you take the money directly from our account and invest it.
Diversify.
Diversify it.
And then all the dividends and all the profits and the what-have-you comes back into our account.
Boom, absolutely.
And you'll get a detailed statement showing you how much your money is growing, biggest bulls of the month, et cetera.
Ken, buddy, let's do this.
Great.
Right there, Viktor with a "K," and, Giselle, you are next.
This is so exciting.
Mmm-hmm.
Folks, it's been a pleasure.
Oops, I got that.
Can't let you do it, son.
JIMMY:
Wait.
What?
Ken, you are the greatest.
Thank you.
No problemo.
Hey, this will be the best decision you'll ever make.
KIM:
Oh, I believe it.
All right, well, we should get out of your hair.
Yeah.
Wait, wait.
This is for you.
Now, that's got all my contact info.
Call me anytime with questions or anything at all.
Ken.
Bye.
Call me, guys.
Bye.
Try and stop us.
Wow.
(CHUCKLES)
Just wow.
(SCOFFS)
(SIGHS)
Hey.
What...
Is this right?
Yes, sir, it is.
KIM:
Go, go, go, go, go.
(BOTH LAUGHING)
Zafiro Anejo.
Shh.
He's gonna come out.
Oh, no.
I didn't read the fine print.
Wait.
Yeah.
Holy crap.
I can't...
(LAUGHING)
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
(EXHALES)
(WATER RUNNING)
Can I borrow that when you're done?
No, that's gross.
How is it gross?
Our germs have already intermingled.
It's my toothbrush.
It's different.
(SPITS)
Why is it different?
Because.
You know, gums bleed, and there's...
There's cold sores, all sorts of food and...
Come on.
What?
No.
Come on.
I'll do it right now.
I don't care.
I need to brush my teeth.
I don't have an extra.
It's not my problem.
That's fine.
I got this.
Good.
I'm fine with this.
Yeah, me, too.
Wait till you see what I floss with.
(CHUCKLES)
That's a keeper.
(LAUGHING)
Thank you, Viktor with a "K."
(CLICKS TONGUE)
Hey, wouldn't it be great if we could do that every night?
Yes, it would.
But we can't.
I know, yeah.
But I'm just saying, if we could, it would be great.
But I know we can't.
Oh, crap.
I can't be late today.
Howard is doling out assignments, and the last one through the door could get stuck in doc review.
You got somewhere to go?
Yeah.
Uh, yeah, I got somewhere.
You good?
(SIGHS) Yeah.
All good.
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
Daniel Wormald?
I'm Officer Baker.
This is Officer Saxton.
Yeah, please.
Come on in.
Come in.
It's over here.
See what they did?
I mean, all gone.
All of them, just...
Uh...
What's all gone?
I have...
I had a baseball card collection.
A major collection, all stolen.
Oh, sorry to hear that.
Was it common knowledge that you have baseball cards?
No, not really.
So, nobody in particular you can think of wanted 'em?
No.
Not that I...
No.
How'd they get in?
Uh, the back door over here.
It was open when I came home for lunch.
I mean, it was locked, but they must have jimmied it open or something.
Uh-huh.
At what time you figure this happened?
PRYCE:
I left for work at 8:15, came home for lunch at 12:30, and called you immediately.
Was anything else taken?
Cash, a fair bit, uh...
How much cash?
PRYCE:
Uh, I don't know.
Let's focus on what's important here.
You know, all I really care about are my baseball cards.
You know, I have a Topps Mickey Mantle rookie card that's irreplaceable.
It's a mint, 60/40, 90/10 on the reverse.
I can go on.
All my cards are in top-loaders, but if they're taken out and exposed to the elements,
I mean, or creased, God forbid.
I mean, you're looking at a nine-point downgrade in a matter of seconds.
I understand the first 48 hours are the most important in investigations like this.
So, the more time passes,
I mean, the less likely we are of a recovery.
So, time is of the essence here, guys.
Well, we're gonna help you out the best we can, Mr. Wormald.
Good.
Well, they really tossed this place.
(SCOFFS)
I mean, are you sure they weren't looking for anything else?
Like what?
I don't know.
Just wondering your thoughts.
I assume more baseball cards.
Did you have more baseball cards than the ones you keep locked in that case here?
Yes, in back.
Thousands.
But these were the crown jewels over here.
The all-star lineup.
Right.
Hmm.
What?
SAXTON:
Just trying to make sense of it.
What's to make sense of?
I mean, isn't it as simple as the perp was looking for more baseball cards?
Or hopped up on speed or whatever and went nuts with the vandalism?
Yeah.
I mean, that could be.
Yeah.
Pretty sweet Hummer parked in the driveway.
That yours?
Yeah, that's mine.
Uh, it's a lease.
Got a great deal on it.
It's very sweet.
They say Arnold Schwarzenegger is the reason that Hummers exist.
I don't know how, but that's what they say.
No kidding.
Yeah.
Uh...
What kind of work do you do, Mr. Wormald?
Uh, I work IT for a pharmaceutical company.
SAXTON:
Wow, computers.
God, I should've gotten into computers.
I'd have that same Hummer.
Yeah, right.
Look, guys, I'm glad you like my car.
But I think we're lookin' through the wrong end of the telescope here.
The priority is my baseball cards.
Of course.
Yes, now, I have a detailed manifest of my entire collection.
And asterisks next to the high-ticket items.
So, it's clear which ones they're gonna try to fence first.
'Cause they're super, super valuable.
So, you're gonna want to get this list out to pawnshops, uh, collectors.
Question anyone who's done any sort of crime like this in the past.
The usual suspects.
Uh, can I get you the list so you can start investigating?
Yeah, you...
Yeah, if you could get us that list...
Okay, I'll print it out.
Hank Aaron, mint.
God, my signed Derek Jeter.
Willie Mays, O-Pee-Chee.
Got to breathe.
Just keep breathing.
Keep breathing.
Okay.
I know, right?
Left the TV.
Uh-huh.
Left the computer.
Right.
Uh... (SCOFFS)
There's something wrong with this picture.
(CREAKING)
(CELL PHONE DIALING)
Hey, it's me.
Another perfect day in paradise out here.
I'm in the pool.
Okay, call me.
(LINE DISCONNECTS)
Hi.
How are you?
Hey, babe.
Did you get lunch?
I did.
MAN:
I think I'm burning up back here.
GIRL:
Really?
Well, you're just in luck.
Look what I have.
MAN:
Oh, great.
(EXCLAIMS)
Oh, yeah, you're all red back here.
Yeah.
MAN:
That feels good, babe.
GIRL:
I told you not to spend so much time in the sun.
You don't listen.
Yeah, it's me again.
Listen, as I speak, not 25 feet away from me,
I'm looking at the mark.
Think Thurston Howell III if he shacked up with Ginger.
(CHUCKLES) He's dripping in Gucci.
It's like I'm at the watering hole and I'm watching the fattest, slowest water buffalo expose his neck to me.
And I'm the lioness ready to strike.
(CHUCKLES) Come, Kim, join me.
Join the pride.
Oh, I said "lioness" because it's the females who do all the hunting.
Uh, I just wanted to be species-accurate, irrespective of my own sex.
It's a National Geographic thing.
Anyway...
Get out here.
Bye.

(SIGHS)
Santa Fe, New Mexico.
I need the number of a law firm.
Davis and Main.
Yeah, you can connect me.

OMAR:
There are a few options on the company cars.
We can arrange a test drive whenever you'd like.
Company car.
Wow.
And there's a service that will deliver it right to you, wherever you want.
And if you find you're not happy with it, it's not a big deal to change it out.
(CHUCKLES) That sounds really... (SIGHS) Yeah.
This is uh, interesting.
Oh, if... (CHUCKLES)
If this isn't to your taste, we have a collection of art in-house you can choose from.
Anytime you're ready, I can put together some samples for you to review.
I...
No, I like this.
Good.
Well, any other needs you have,
I'm here to help.
Office supplies, dietary needs...
Anything special you want stocked in the fridge?
Uh, maybe a humidifier?
Gets kind of dry in here.
Omar, I'm pretty low-maintenance.
Sure.
Well, if there's anything you need,
I'm right outside the door.
Great.
If I think of anything.
Good.
Hey, do you think...
Uh, I'm just looking at this.
Do we get a choice of desks?
What were you thinking?
Uh...
Is it possible...
Um...
Can we do a cocobolo?
Cocobolo desk?
Absolutely.
I'll get right on that.
(CHUCKLES)
(INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS)
Previously on "Better Call Saul..."
Why were you working against me?
You're not a real lawyer!
Now that I'm doing the job alone, I get the full 1500.
I can get more pills.
If you're gonna be a criminal, do your homework.
Thanks for not heading to the Bahamas with this.
- What are you doing?
- "The right thing."
Whatever it was, did you get it out of your system?
Yep, all gone.
The Sandpiper case?
It's getting too big for HHM.
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about there's an office in Santa Fe with your name on it.
Good night, ladies.
Get home safe.
See you later, Gene.
Good night.
No, no, no, no!
God damn it!
No!
Oh, c-come on.
Hey!
Hey!
Somebody!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Ah, here he is.
Oh, great.
Jimmy, right on time.
Good to see you.
Hello, Howard.
Hey.
Hi.
James McGill, Clifford Main.
Just "Jimmy." And it's a pleasure to meet you, Clifford.
Likewise.
We know all about your work on Sandpiper.
Well, it's a group effort.
I mean, the folks at HHM are just knocking it out of the park.
Well, you know, the case wouldn't exist without you.
Absolutely.
Once you get him on your team, you'll know why I call him "Charlie Hustle."
Jimmy, these are my associates...
Brian Archuleta and Erin Brill.
- Nice to meet you both.
- It's great to meet you.
I hate to do this, but, um, could I borrow Ms. Wexler for a moment?
If you will excuse us?
Pardon me.
What's going on?
I just, um
Listen, here's the thing.
If I take this job, does that mean the two of us...
I mean, uh...
Does it mean, uh...
What?
What...
What the hell is this?
If I take this job today, with Davis and Main does that mean that you and me...
Is this...
Is this gonna happen?
Jimmy, I...
I...
One thing has absolutely nothing to do with the other.
Nothing at all.
No.
Of course not.
Why would it?
Great.
Uh, sorry about that.
Listen, I just want to say thank you, sincerely,
For your interest in me.
It's an honor to be considered,
But at this time...
At this time...
Um, I'm gonna have to take myself out of the running.
Thanks.
Thank you, Howard.
Uh, Jimmy?
Well, that was quick.
No charge.
Help me out here.
Did I dream it,
Or did I have $1,600,000 on my desk in cash?
No one on god's green earth knew we had it.
We could've split it 50/50.
We could've gone home with $800,000... each!
Tax-free!
Your point being?
Why didn't we?
I remember you saying something about doing the right thing.
You want to know why I didn't take that money?
Is that what you're asking?
Yeah, that's what I'm asking.
Me, personally, I was hired to do a job.
I did it.
That's as far as it goes.
Yeah.
Well, I know what stopped me.
And you know what?
It's never stopping me again.
Chao cac co, ladies!
Chao cac co!
Mrs. Nguyen, it's a beautiful day out there.
You should get out of this place once in a while.
You know, throw a frisbee, have some fun.
I have a business to run.
Uh, no.
The business is running you.
Listen to me.
You'll thank me later.
Cucumber water for customer only.
Hey!
It's me!
Geez.
Hello?
Hello?
It's me.
I got a new car.
You like it?
We're not taking that to the meet.
How are we gonna get there?
I'll drive.
My car.
Why?
This business requires restraint.
That is the opposite of restraint.
But...
I like it.
I mean, I'm proud of it.
Good.
Then you be proud of it on your own time, but not with me.
I'm not getting in that.
Okay.
Then... then don't.
Honestly, uh, you don't really do anything.
I've been paying you the salary of three people to just stand behind me.
You know?
And...
And these...
these last few deals...
This Nacho fella, he's been coming alone.
I mean, if he doesn't need backup men, then, I mean, why do I need you?
I should just go alone.
I'm throwing...
I'm throwing away money.
Just tossing it away.
Into the trash.
Look, you do whatever you want, but I'm advising you...
do not go to that meet without someone watching your back.
Yeah, well, of course you're gonna say that.
I mean, you don't want to be out of this easy-peasy job.
Well, I'm sorry, but this is the gravy train, and it's leaving the station right now.
So last chance.
All aboard.
Seriously, last chance.
I'm gonna count to, say, 10, and then I'm...
All right, then.
Your services are no longer needed!
Hola.
No old guy?
What, did he break a hip or something?
I know, right?
Yeah, no, we, uh...
We... we parted ways.
Yeah, saw things differently.
So...
You know how it is.
This is interesting.
Oh, yeah.
You like it?
Can I take a look?
Oh.
Be my guest.
Get in.
Check it out.
Wow.
Impressive.
Thank you.
Get in.
Feel the leather.
Yeah, it's a H2.
Brand-new off the line.
Slimmer than the H1 but longer, more height.
Yeah, it's a honey.
V-8 engine, 325 horsepower, tri-zone climate controls.
So you can have a girl in a bikini and another in a parka, and they're both gonna be comfortable.
You're running around with two girls in your S.U.V., you'd be really comfortable, huh?
Oh, yeah.
Yes.
I'm gonna count this quick.
Do your thing.
Make sure it's right.
Okeydokey.
We are good.
Uh, same as before.
Uh, still factory-sealed.
And, as always, you're welcome to count them.
I trust you.
Great.
Thank you.
See you next time.
Hello?
Yes.
Uh, no.
Sorry.
But...
Yes, this is James McGill, but I'm no longer a lawyer, so...
That's right... not a lawyer.
Bye.
So, this is what a midlife crisis looks like?
Not midlife crisis.
Clarity.
Midlife clarity.
Clarity?
Huh.
Clearly explain to me why you walked out on the best job opportunity of your life.
Get in the pool, and I'll tell ya.
Get in the pool?
Yeah.
Come on.
Just pop in the gift shop and buy a bathing suit... get a one-piece, nothing fancy.
The water is perfect.
It's 82 degrees.
You can order a drink.
And you got to try this crab dip.
Why are you acting like this?
I'm not acting like anything.
I just... finally decided to be me.
Everything okay, Mr. Cumpston?
Would you like another drink?
Uh, I'm good with this.
I'll tell you what, Mr. Cumpston.
If you really want to talk, I'll be in the bar.
Not for long.
Hey, Rolando.
Check.
What do...
What do you mean "quit the law"?
I quit it.
Simple as that.
Oh, well, thanks for explaining, Jimmy.
- It's super-clear now.
- Hey, buddy?
Uh, is that a misprint right there?
It's got to be, right?
- The Zafiro Anejo?
- Yeah.
That's correct, actually, believe it or not.
Holy shit.
A $50 shot of tequila?
Is it worth it?
Apparently.
I mean, it's kind of a personal-choice kind of thing.
Well, I can't die without trying a $50 shot of tequila, so, uh... two... dos... neat.
And, uh, we can charge that to the room, can't we?
No, we can't.
We...
I am paying.
And he will be having a shot of your well brand, and I'll have a glass of your house red.
We have a Cabernet, a Pinot, and a Syrah.
Whatever.
Dealer's choice.
Something with alcohol.
You got it.
Jimmy... did something happen in Cicero?
Why did something have to happen in Cicero?
Because when I talked to you about Davis Main, you were ready to take the job.
Now you're back, and you're suddenly quitting the law, cheating hotels out of expensive liquor, wearing a weird pinkie ring?
What, are you in the Mafia now?
Asking if we have a future.
I mean, where did that come from?
I don't know.
I just...
Well, Cicero has nothing to do with it.
It's my whole life.
Well, my life since Chuck made me come to Albuquerque.
Ever since I got here, all I've done is try to make Chuck happy, bend over backwards to please Chuck.
Chuck, Chuck, Chuck.
Well, no more.
You quitting the law... isn't that exactly what Chuck wants?
Who cares?
This is for me, okay?
I-I got into the law for all the wrong reasons.
I'm trusting my instincts.
I think that my talents are better spent elsewhere.
Where?
Floating in somebody else's pool?
Jimmy, you're a great lawyer.
Why give that up?
I'm not saying it didn't have its moments, but the stuff I liked about it... selling people, convincing people...
I don't have to be a lawyer to do that.
Besides, people tell me how they see me, and it's not as a lawyer.
All right.
Here you go.
Thank you.
Lemme know if I can get you guys anything else, okay?
Bobby, what up, brother man?
Oh, thanks.
Short it.
Short it.
Short it.
Short that shit.
That stock is useless.
It's got no legs.
It's like a circus freak minus the fun.
And that one's even worse.
Who's giving you these?
Please do me a favor.
Take a pillow, put it over that stock's face until you hear the deathbed queef.
- It's a loser.
- Okay, so... if you're not gonna be a lawyer, then what?
Float around and wait for your Sandpiper money to roll in?
No.
That could take years.
Sandpiper has no bearing on this at all.
Yeah, it's got legs.
Okay, then, what's the plan?
To be open to the universe.
Okay, so no plan.
Just walk the Earth, like Jules at the end of "Pulp Fiction"?
Look, whatever the universe presents, whatever opportunity arises, I will take it.
- Whatever opportunity?
- Yeah.
Wasn't Davis Main an opportunity?
It's a great opportunity, and you're walking away from it.
Not him, not the guy who...
Look, shouldn't you at least try the job before you say no?
And waste everyone's time, including my own?
Kim, I appreciate your concern, but it's not for me.
I don't want it.
Jimmy, do you remember how long you studied for that bar?
How hard you worked?
All that effort, you're just gonna toss it away?
That's the Sunk Cost Fallacy.
W...
The what?
The Fallacy of Sunk Cost...
It's what gamblers do.
They throw good money after bad thinking they can turn their luck around.
It's like, "I've already spent this much money or time... whatever.
I got to keep going!"
No, there's no reward at the end of this game.
You are making a mistake.
I know you're making a mistake.
I've been doing the "right" thing for all these years now, and where has it gotten me?
Nowhere.
I'm sorry.
I don't...
It's not my thing.
I don't get it.
- I just don't get it.
- It's what's right for me.
Donkey balls.
Pure donkey balls, dude.
Wall Street's for suckers.
Who needs that aggravation?
If the the Oracle doesn't have to live there, then I sure as hell don't.
I can make a million-dollar stock trade on my laptop sitting on a toilet.
Like Midas, shitting gold bricks on my throne.
That's why Speigelman and Deitch want my business so bad.
I'm a golden God.
Look, of course I remember that.
Who forgets a thing like that?
That fart had the anger of a repressed minority community.
You fart like that in someone's face, you're gonna give them pinkeye for life.
Good convo, bro.
Till next time, brutha-man.
- Flip side.
On it.
- Come with me.
- What?
- Just come on.
Trust me.
What are you gonna do?
You want to understand what I'm talking about?
Follow my lead.
Hey, buddy, could you settle a bet for us?
- I what?
- Uh, sorry.
I don't want to make it sound like I was eavesdropping, but I kind of was.
Uh, we heard you talking about stocks.
Uh-huh.
Yeah, so, question... if you could settle a debate between me and my sister.
Uh, you know what?
We probably shouldn't be bothering this...
We wouldn't normally do this...
Right?
but we need an expert.
This guy sounds like he knows his stuff.
Yeah, go.
Okay.
Here's the question.
Uh, when it comes to the stock market, is there, like, a financial limit to how much a person's allowed to invest?
A limit?
No.
No limit.
Knew it.
Oh, even if it's an inheritance?
You know, with, like, inheritance taxes and whatnot?
Nope.
Same.
That's...
Oh, fantastic.
Thank you, buddy.
See?
No limit.
Told you we could invest it all.
And it's a smart move, too.
Sticking it all in the bank?
No.
Um, yeah.
You can... invest all your money.
Just make sure you diversify.
Yeah.
Diversify.
That's...
You got to...
Oh, hey, um...
What do you mean, "diversify"?
Well, diversify is...
Y-You know that saying,
"Don't put all your eggs in one basket," right?
Same principle.
No, it makes complete sense.
Thank you.
Now, if I had an idea of the money we're talking about...
Ballpark...
I could give you examples of smart diversification.
Yeah, um...
Look, an uncle on our father's side recently passed, and he left us somewhere in the neighborhood of $1.4 million.
And I don't mean to be greedy, but I think, if we invest it smart now, we could double it, triple it... we could quadruple the whole inheritance, right?
In my opinion?
Fortune favors the bold, man.
Now, if you guys are free to join me for a drink,
I can give you a quick consult.
That's all right.
We were gonna do it ourselves through one of those online brokerage websites.
We're just gonna pick, uh, a classic, like...
I think they're called blue-chip stocks?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you can totally do it yourself.
Shoot for the tried and true.
'Course, you might be putting your cash in the Hindenburg, the Andrea Doria, uh..."Corky Romano."
Right?
They all seemed rock-solid beforehand, but then...
Yeah, not good.
Not good, yeah.
So, how do you know?
Well, that's where someone like myself comes in.
Proven track record as a wealth manager.
I take calculated but aggressive risks 'cause I want to catch lightning.
And I do.
Practically a money-printing machine.
That sounds good.
A money-printing machine.
Listen, there's a little booth over here.
There's some privacy.
We can talk.
No obligations.
We can just... just rap about this a little bit.
- Yeah, I guess.
- Yeah?
What do you say, sis?
Can we just talk?
Electric slide on in there.
And we'll just rap a little bit.
It's no...
My name's Ken, by the way.
Uh, Viktor, with a "K."
Cool.
Viktor with a "K."
And this lovely lady is?
It's...
Giselle.
Giselle Saint Claire.
Ah, lovely.
Please, sit.
I won't bite.
So, Viktor with a "K" and Giselle... exotic names.
They're Dutch.
Well, Boer, to be precise.
Our... father's side of the family is from South Africa, which is where uncle Humphrey passed away.
South Africa.
They grow them beautiful down there, right?
Charlize Theron.
And you.
Oh.
Well...
I've never actually been, but hope to go someday.
Tell you what, by the time I'm done with you two, you might be taking your own private jet.
Nice.
Excuse me.
Hi.
Uh, we are sitting here now, so, uh, we could use a wine list, if you get a chance...
Hey, uh, are a tequila fan?
Yes.
You down for that?
You ever try Zafiro Anejo?
No, I have not, but I'm down for whatever.
Three of whatever she just said.
- You got it.
- All right.
So, stock market.
A great investment.
And you're picking the right time to jump in.
Why do you listen to me?
I'm an idiot.
And talks about his cars, talks about...
- How many cars did he have?
- I don't think...
- It doesn't make sense.
- That's it, Ken.
Oh, yeah.
Compliments of the bartender.
She thought you might want a souvenir.
Oh, my God.
Did we drink the entire bottle?
Not yet, we didn't.
- Boom.
- Hey, hey, cheers.
Uh, I think we're ready for the check.
No, really, it's the smart way to go.
Okay.
But, so, to be clear, you take the money directly from our account and invest it.
- Diversify.
- Diversify it.
And then all the dividends and all the profits and the...what-have-you comes back into our account.
Boom.
Absolutely.
And you'll get a detailed statement showing you how much your money is growing... biggest bulls of the month, et cetera.
Ken, buddy...
let's do this.
Great.
Right there, Viktor with a "K,"
and, Giselle, you are next.
- This is so exciting.
- Mm-hmm.
Folks, it's been a pleasure.
- Oops, I got that.
- Can't let you do it, son.
Wait.
What?
Ken, you are the greatest.
- Thank you.
- No problem-o.
Hey, this will be the best decision you'll ever make.
Oh, I believe it.
All right, well, we should get out of your hair.
- Yeah.
- Oh, wait, wait.
This... is for you.
Now, that's got all my contact info.
Call me anytime with questions or anything at all.
Ken.
Bye.
Call me, guys.
- Bye.
- Try and stop us.
Wow.
Just wow.
Hey.
What I...
Is this right?
Yes, sir, it is.
Go, go, go, go, go!
- Zafiro Anejo!
- Shh!
He's gonna come out.
Oh, no.
I didn't read the fine print.
- Wait.
- Yeah!
Holy crap.
I can't b...
Can I borrow that when you're done?
No, that's gross.
H-how is it gross?
Our germs have already intermingled.
It's my toothbrush.
It's different.
Why is it different?
Because.
You know, gums bleed, and there's... there's cold sores, all sorts of food and weir...
Let me see that.
Come on.
What?
No!
Come on!
I'll do it right now.
- I don't care.
- I need to brush my teeth.
I don't have an extra.
It's not my problem.
That's fine.
I got this.
Good.
I'm fine with this.
Yeah, me too.
Wait till you see what I floss with.
That's a keeper.
Thank you, Viktor with a "K."
Hey, wouldn't it be great if we could do that every night?
Yes, it would.
But...
We can't.
I know, yeah.
But I'm just saying, if we could, it would be great.
But I know we can't.
Oh, crap.
I can't be late today.
Howard is doling out assignments, and the last one through the door could get stuck in doc review.
You got somewhere to go?
Yeah.
Uh, yeah, I got somewhere.
You good?
Yeah.
All good.
Daniel Wormald?
I'm Officer Baker.
This is Officer Saxton.
Yeah, please.
Come on in.
Come in.
It's over here.
See what they did?
I mean, all gone.
All of them, just...
Uh, what's all gone?
I have...
I had a baseball-card collection... a major collection...
All stolen.
Oh, sorry to hear that.
Uh, was it common knowledge that you have baseball cards?
No, not really.
So, nobody in particular you can think of wanting them?
No.
Not that I...
No.
How'd they get in?
Uh, the back door over here.
It was open when I came home for lunch.
I mean, it was locked, but they must have jimmied it open or something.
Uh-huh.
At what time, uh, you figure this happened?
I left for work at 8:15, came home for lunch at 12:30, and called you immediately.
Was anything else taken?
Cash... a fair bit.
Uh, um...
How much cash?
Uh, I don't know.
You know, let's focus on what's important here, you know?
All I really care about are my baseball cards.
You know, I have a Topps Mickey Mantle rookie card that's irreplaceable.
It's a mint, 60/40, 90/10 on the reverse.
I can go on.
All my cards are in top-loaders, but if they're taken out and exposed to the elements,
I mean, or creased, God forbid,
I mean, you're looking at a 9-point downgrade in a matter of seconds.
I understand the first 48 hours are the most important in investigations like this, so the more time passes,
I mean, the less likely we are of a recovery.
So...time is of the essence here, guys.
Well, we're gonna help you out the best we can, Mr. Wormald.
Good.
Well...they really tossed this place.
I mean, are you sure they weren't looking for anything else?
Like what?
I don't know.
J-Just wondering your thoughts.
I assume more baseball cards.
Did you have more baseball cards than the ones you keep locked in that case here?
Yes, in... in back... thousands.
But these were the crown jewels over here.
You know, t-the all-star lineup.
Right.
Hmm.
What?
Just trying to make sense of it.
What's to make sense of?
I mean, isn't it as simple as the perp was looking for more baseball cards?
Or hopped up on speed or whatever and went nuts with the vandalism?
Yeah.
I mean, that could be.
Yeah.
Pretty sweet Hummer parked in the driveway.
That yours?
Yeah, that's mine.
Uh, it's a lease.
Got a great deal on it.
It's very sweet.
You know, they say Arnold Schwarzenegger is the reason that Hummers exist.
I don't know how, but that's what they say.
- No kidding.
- Yeah.
Huh.
What kind of work do you do, Mr. Wormald?
Uh, I work I.T., uh, for a pharmaceutical company.
Wow.
Computers.
God, I should've gotten into computers.
- I'd have that same Hummer.
- Yeah, right.
Look, guys, I'm glad you like my car, but I think we're looking through the wrong end of the telescope here.
You know, the priority is my baseball cards.
Of course.
Yes, now, I have a detailed manifest of my entire collection and asterisks next to the high-ticket items, so it's clear which ones they're gonna try to fence first, 'cause they're super, super valuable.
So you're gonna want to get this list out to pawnshops, uh, collectors, question anyone who's done any sort of crime like this in the past.
You know, the... the usual suspects.
Uh, can I get you the list so you can start investigating?
Yeah, you...
Yeah, if you could get us that list...
Okay, I'll...
I'll print it out.
Hank Aaron, mint.
God, my signed Derek Jeter.
Willie Mays, O-Pee-Chee.
Got to breathe.
Just keep breathing.
Keep breathing.
- Okay.
- I know, right?
- Left the TV.
- Uh-huh.
- Left the computer.
- Right.
Huh.
There's something wrong with this picture.
Hey, it's me.
Another perfect day in paradise out here.
I'm in the pool.
Okay, call me.
- Hi!
How are you?
- Hey, babe.
Did you get lunch?
I did.
You know, I think I'm burning up back here.
Oh, really?
Well, you're just in luck.
- Look what I have.
- Oh, hey, great.
Oh, yeah, you're all red back here.
Yeah.
That feels good, babe.
I told you not to spend so much time in the sun.
You don't listen.
Yeah, it's me again.
Listen, as I speak, not 25 feet away from me,
I'm looking at the mark.
Think Thurston Howell III if he shacked up with Ginger.
He's dripping in Gucci.
It's like I'm at the watering hole, and I'm watching the fattest, slowest water buffalo expose his neck to me, and I'm the lioness ready to strike.
Come, Kim.
Join me.
Join the pride.
Um, I said "lioness"
because it's the females who do all the hunting.
Uh, just wanted to be species-accurate, irrespective of my own sex.
It's a National Geographic thing.
Anyway...
Get out here.
Bye.
Santa Fe, New Mexico.
I need the number of a law firm...
Davis Main.
Yeah, you can connect me.
Davis Main.
There are a few options on the company cars.
We can arrange a test-drive whenever you'd like.
Company car... wow.
And there's a service that will deliver it right to you, wherever you want.
And if you find you're not happy with it, it's not a big deal to change it out.
That sounds really, uh...
Yeah.
This is, uh, interesting.
Oh, if, uh...
If this isn't to your taste, we have a collection of art in-house you can, uh, choose from.
Anytime you're ready,
I can put together some samples for you to review.
I...
I...
No, I like this.
Good.
Uh, well, any other needs you have, I'm here to help.
Office supplies, dietary needs...
Anything special you want stocked in the fridge?
Uh, maybe a humidifier?
Gets kind of dry in here.
Omar, I...
I'm pretty low-maintenance.
Sure.
Well, if there's anything you need,
I'm right outside the door.
Great.
If I think of anything.
Good.
Hey, do you think, um...
I'm just looking at this.
D-Do we get a choice of desks?
What were you thinking?
Um... is it possible, um...
Can we do... cocobolo?
Cocobolo desk?
Absolutely.
I'll get right on that.
Good night, ladies.
Get home safe.
- See you later.
- Good night.
No, no.
No!
No!
Goddamn it!
No.
Come on.
Hey!
Hey!
Somebody!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
-
-The problem with it is because they believe he's worth... the problem of the National Football... the football from a player...
- -that took place.
Those were attitudes...
-
-I mean, there are plenty of rules in play...
You can go.
Here he is.
Great.
Jimmy, right on time.
Good to see you.
Hello, Howard.
- Hey.
Hi.
- James McGill, Clifford Main.
Just Jimmy.
It's a pleasure to meet you, Clifford.
Likewise.
We know all about your work on Sandpiper.
Well, it's a group effort.
I mean, the folks at HHM are just knocking it out of the park.
- The case wouldn't exist without you.
- Absolutely.
Once you get him on your team, you'll know why I call him Charlie Hustle.
Jimmy, these are my associates, Brian Archuleta and Erin Brill.
- Nice to meet you both.
- Great to meet you.
I hate to do this... but could I borrow Ms. Wexler for a moment?
- If you will excuse us...
- Pardon me.
- What's going on?
- I just...
Listen, here's the thing.
If I take this job, does that mean the two of us...?
I mean...
- Does it mean...?
- What?
What?
What the hell is this?
If I take this job today with Davis Main... does that mean that you and me...?
Is this...
Is this gonna happen?
Jimmy.
I...
I...
One thing has absolutely nothing to do with the other.
- Nothing at all?
- No.
Of course not, why would it?
Great.
Sorry about that.
Listen, I just wanna say thank you, sincerely, for your interest in me.
It's an honor to be considered, but at this time...
At this time...
I'm gonna have to take myself out of the running.
Thanks.
Thank you, Howard.
Jimmy?
Well, that was quick.
- No charge.
- Help me out here.
Did I dream it... or did I have $1,600,000 on my desk in cash?
No one on God's green earth knew we had it.
We could've split it fifty-fifty.
We could've gone home with $800,000 each... tax free.
Your point being?
Why didn't we?
I remember you saying something about doing the right thing.
You wanna know why I didn't take that money?
Is that what you're asking?
Yeah, that's what I'm asking.
Me personally, I was hired to do a job...
I did it, that's as far as it goes.
Yeah, well...
I know what stopped me.
And you know what?
It's never stopping me again.
Chào các cô, ladies.
Mrs. Nguyen, it's a beautiful day out, you should get out once in a while.
Throw a Frisbee, have some fun.
I have a business to run.
No, the business is running you.
Listen to me.
You'll thank me later.
Cucumber water for customer only.
Hey, it's me.
Jesus.
Hello?
Hello?
It's me.
I got a new car.
You like it?
We're not taking that to the meet.
How are we gonna get there?
I'll drive my car.
- Why?
- This business requires restraint.
That is the opposite of restraint.
But I like it.
I mean, I'm proud of it.
Good, then you be proud of it on your own time.
But not with me, I'm not getting in that.
Okay, then don't.
Honestly, you don't really do anything.
I've been paying you the salary of three people... to just stand behind me.
You know?
And these last few deals, this Nacho fella, he's been coming alone.
I mean, if he doesn't need backup men, then, I mean, why do I need you?
I should just go alone.
I'm throwing...
I'm throwing away money.
Just tossing it away into the trash.
Look, you do whatever you want, but I'm advising you... do not go to that meet without someone watching your back.
Yeah, well, of course you're gonna say that.
I mean, you don't wanna be out of this easy-peasy job.
Well, I'm sorry, but this is the gravy train... and it's leaving the station right now.
So last chance.
All aboard.
Seriously, last chance.
I'm gonna count to, say, 10, and then I'm...
All right, then, your services are no longer needed.
No old guy?
What, did he break a hip or something?
I know, right?
Yeah, no, we...
We parted ways.
Yeah, saw things differently, so...
You know how it is.
This is interesting.
Oh, yeah.
You like it?
- Can I take a look?
- Oh, be my guest.
Get in, check it out.
- Impressive.
- Thank you.
Get in, feel the leather.
Yeah, it's a H2.
Brand-new off the line.
Slimmer than the H1, but longer, more height.
Yeah, it's a honey.
V8 engine, 325 horsepower.
Tri-zone climate controls, so you can have a girl in a bikini... and another in a parka, and they're both gonna be comfortable.
You're riding around with two girls in your SUV.
- You'd be really comfortable, huh?
- Oh, yeah.
Yes.
I'm gonna count this quick.
Do your thing, make sure it's right.
Okey-dokey, we are good.
Same as before.
Still factory sealed.
And as always, you're welcome to count them.
I trust you.
Great, thank you.
See you next time.
Hello.
Yes.
No, sorry.
Yes, this is James McGill, but I'm no longer a lawyer, so...
That's right, not a lawyer.
Bye.
So this is what a midlife crisis looks like?
Not midlife crisis.
Clarity.
Midlife clarity.
Clarity?
Clearly explain to me why you walked out on the best job opportunity of your life.
Get in the pool and I'll tell you.
- Get in the pool?
- Yeah, come on.
Pop in the gift shop and buy a bathing suit.
Get a one-piece, nothing fancy.
The water is perfect, it's 82 degrees.
You can order a drink, and you gotta try this crab dip.
- Why are you acting like this?
- I'm not acting like anything.
I just finally decided to be me.
Everything okay, Mr. Cumpston?
Would you like another drink?
I'm good with this.
I'll tell you what, Mr. Cumpston.
If you really wanna talk, I'll be in the bar.
Not for long.
Hey, Rolando, check.
What do you...
What do you mean, "quit the law"?
I quit it, simple as that.
Oh, well, thanks for explaining, Jimmy...
- it's super clear now.
- Hey, buddy?
Is that a misprint right there?
It's gotta be, right?
- The Zafiro Añejo?
- Yeah.
- That's correct, believe it or not.
- Holy shit, a $50 shot of tequila?
- Is it worth it?
- Apparently.
It's kind of a personal choice thing.
Well, I can't die without trying a $50 shot of tequila, so two.
Dos, neat, and we can charge that to the room, can't we?
No, we can't.
We...
I am paying.
And he will be having a shot of your well brand... and I'll have a glass of your house red.
We have a cabernet, a pinot and a syrah.
Whatever, dealer's choice.
- Something with alcohol.
- You got it.
Jimmy.
Did something happen in Cicero?
Why did something have to happen?
When I talked to you about Davis Main, you were ready to take the job.
Now you're back, and you're suddenly quitting the law?
Cheating hotels out of expensive liquor.
Wearing a weird pinkie ring.
What, are you in the Mafia now?
Asking if we have a future.
I mean, where did that come from?
I don't know, I just...
Cicero has nothing to do with it.
It's my whole life.
Well... my life since Chuck made me come to Albuquerque.
Ever since I got here, all I've done is try to make Chuck happy.
Bend over backwards to please Chuck.
Chuck, Chuck, Chuck.
Well, no more.
You quitting the law, isn't that exactly what Chuck wants?
Who cares?
This is for me, okay?
I got into the law for all the wrong reasons.
I'm trusting my instincts.
I think that my talents are better spent elsewhere.
Where?
Floating in somebody else's pool?
Jimmy, you're a great lawyer.
Why give that up?
I'm not saying it didn't have its moments.
But the stuff I liked about it, selling people, convincing people...
I don't have to be a lawyer to do that.
Besides, people tell me how they see me...
- and it's not as a lawyer.
- All right.
- Here you go.
- Thank you.
Let me know if I can get you guys anything else, okay?
- Bobby, what up, brother-man?
- Oh, thanks.
Short it.
Short it.
Short it.
Short that shit.
That stock is useless, it's got no legs.
It's like a circus freak minus the fun.
That one's even worse.
Who's giving you these?
Do me a favor.
Take a pillow... put it over that stock's face until you hear the deathbed queef.
- Okay, so?
- It's a loser.
If you're not gonna be a lawyer, then what?
Float around and wait for your Sandpiper money to roll in?
- That could take years.
- Sandpiper has no bearing on this at all.
Okay, then, what's the plan?
- To be open to the universe.
- Okay, so no plan.
Just walk the earth?
Like Jules at the end of Pulp Fiction?
Look, whatever the universe presents, whatever opportunity arises...
- I will take it.
- Whatever opportunity?
- Yeah.
- Wasn't Davis Main an opportunity?
It's a great opportunity, and you're walking away from it.
Look... shouldn't you at least try the job before you say no?
And waste everyone's time, including my own?
Kim, I appreciate your concern... but it's not for me.
I don't want it.
Jimmy, do you remember how long you studied for that bar?
- How hard you worked?
- It's like a burn victim...
All that effort, you're just gonna toss it away?
That's the sunk cost fallacy.
- The what?
- The fallacy of sunk cost.
It's what gamblers do, they throw good money after bad... thinking they can turn their luck around.
It's like, "I've already spent this much money..."
or time, whatever, I gotta keep going!"
No, there's no reward at the end of this game.
You are making a mistake.
I know you're making a mistake.
I've been doing the "right thing" and where has it gotten me?
- Nowhere.
- I'm sorry, I don't...
Yeah.
Not my thing.
Not my thing.
Still not my thing.
- I don't get it.
I just don't get it.
- It's what's right for me.
Donkey balls.
Pure donkey balls, dude.
Wall Street's for suckers.
Who needs that aggravation?
If the Oracle doesn't have to live there, I don't.
I can make a million-dollar stock trade on my laptop sitting on a toilet.
Like Midas, shitting gold bricks on my throne.
That's why Spiegelman and Deitch want my business.
I'm a golden god.
Of course I remember.
Who forgets that?
That fart had the anger of a repressed minority community.
You fart like that in someone's face, you're gonna give them pinkeye for life.
Good convo, bro.
Till next time, brother-man.
- Flip side, on it, check you.
- Come with me.
- What?
- Just come on, trust me.
What are you gonna do?
You wanna understand what I'm talking about?
Follow my lead.
Hey, buddy, could you settle a bet for us?
- Can I what?
- Sorry...
I don't want it to sound like I was eavesdropping, but I kind of was.
We heard you talking about stocks.
Yeah, so question... if you could settle a debate between me and my sister.
- We probably shouldn't bother...
- I wouldn't normally do this.
But we need an expert.
This guy sounds like he knows his stuff.
- Yeah, go.
- Okay, here's the question:
When it comes to the stock market, is there a financial limit... to how much a person's allowed to invest?
A limit?
No, no limit.
Knew it!
Oh, even if it's an inheritance?
You know, with, like, inheritance taxes and whatnot?
- Nope, same.
- That's...
Oh, fantastic.
Thank you, buddy.
See, no limit.
Told you we could invest it all, and it's a smart move, too.
Sticking it all in the bank?
No.
Yeah, you can invest all your money, just make sure you diversify.
Yeah, diversify.
That's...
We gotta...
Hey... what do you mean, "diversify"?
Well, diversify is...
You know the saying "don't put all your eggs in one basket"?
- Right?
Same principle.
- Makes complete sense.
Thank you.
If I had an idea of the money we're talking about, ballpark...
I could give you examples of smart diversification.
Yeah.
Look, an uncle on our father's side recently passed... and he left us somewhere in the neighborhood of 1.4 million.
And I don't mean to be greedy, but I think if we invest it smart now... we could double it, triple it... we could quadruple the whole inheritance, right?
In my opinion?
Fortune favors the bold, man.
If you're free to join me for a drink, I can give you a consult.
That's all right, we'll do it ourselves through an online brokerage site.
We're just gonna pick classic...
Like, I think they're called blue chip stocks.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You can totally do it yourself.
Shoot for the tried and true.
Of course, you might be putting your cash in the Hindenburg, Andrea Doria...
Corky Romano.
Right?
They all seemed rock solid beforehand.
But then...
- Yeah, not good.
- Not good, yeah.
So how do you know?
Well, that's where someone like myself comes in.
Proven track record as a wealth manager.
I take calculated but aggressive risks... because I wanna catch lightning, and I do.
- I'm practically a money-printing machine.
- That sounds good.
A money-printing machine.
Listen, there's a little booth over here, there's some privacy, we can talk.
No obligations, we can just rap about this a little bit.
- Yeah, I guess.
- Yeah?
What do you say, sis?
Can we just talk?
Electric slide on in there.
We'll rap a little, it's no...
- My name's Ken, by the way.
- Viktor, with a K.
Cool, Viktor with a K.
And this lovely lady is?
It's Giselle.
- Giselle Saint Claire.
- Lovely.
Please, sit.
I won't bite.
So Viktor with a K and Giselle, exotic names.
- They're Dutch.
- Well, Boer to be precise.
Our father's side of the family is from South Africa... which is where Uncle Humphrey passed away.
South Africa, they grow them beautiful down there, right?
Charlize Theron.
- And you.
- Oh, well.
I've never actually been, but hope to go someday.
Tell you what, when I'm done with you...
- you might take your own private jet.
- Nice.
Excuse me, hi.
We are sitting here now.
We could use a wine list if you get a chance...
Hey, are you a tequila fan?
Yes.
You down for that?
You ever try Zafiro Añejo?
No, I have not, but I'm down for whatever.
Three of whatever she just said.
- You got it.
- All right.
So stock market, a great investment... and you're picking the right time to jump in.
Why do you listen to him?
He's an idiot.
He talks about his cars.
He talks about...
- How many cars did he have?
- I don't think...
- It makes sense.
- That's it, Ken.
Oh, yeah.
Compliments of the bartender.
Thought you might want a souvenir.
- My God, did we drink the entire bottle?
- Not yet, we didn't.
Right here.
Hey, hey, cheers.
I think we're ready for the check.
No, really, it's a smart way to go.
Okay, but, so to be clear... you take the money directly from our account...
- and invest it...
- Diversify it.
Diversify it.
And then all the dividends and all the profits... and the what-have-you comes back into our account.
Absolutely.
You'll get a statement showing how much your money is growing...
- biggest bulls of the month, etcetera.
- Ken, buddy... let's do this.
Great.
Right there, Viktor with a K. And, Giselle, you are next.
This is so exciting.
- Folks, it's been a pleasure.
- I got that.
- Can't let you do it, son.
- Wait, what?
Ken.
- You are the greatest.
Thank you.
- No problemo.
This will be the best decision you'll make.
We should get out of your hair.
- Yeah.
- Wait, wait, wait, this... is for you.
Now, that's got all my contact info.
Call me anytime with questions, or anything at all.
- Ken.
- Bye.
Call me, guys.
- Bye.
- Try and stop us.
Just wow.
Hey.
What...?
- Is this right?
- Yes, sir, it is.
Go, go, go!
Zafiro Añejo!
Shut up.
He's gonna come out.
- Oh, no, I didn't read the fine print.
- Wait!
Yeah!
- Holy crap.
- I can't...
Can I borrow that when you're done?
No, that's gross.
How is it gross?
Our germs have already intermingled.
It's my toothbrush, it's different.
- Why is it different?
- Because.
You know, gums bleed, and there's cold sores...
All sorts of food and weird...
- Come on.
- What?
No!
- Come on, I'll do it right now.
- I don't care.
- I need to brush my teeth.
- I don't have an extra.
That's fine.
I got this.
- Good, I'm fine with it.
- Yeah, me too.
Wait till you see what I floss with.
That's a keeper.
Thank you, Viktor with a K.
Hey, wouldn't it be great if we could do that every night?
Yes, it would.
But we can't.
I know.
Yeah.
But I'm just saying, if we could it would be great.
But I know we can't.
Oh, crap, I can't be late today.
Howard is doling out assignments... and the last one through the door could get stuck in Doc Review.
You got somewhere to go?
Yeah.
Yeah, I got somewhere.
You good?
Yeah, all good.
Daniel Wormald.
I'm Officer Baker, this is Officer Saxton.
Yeah, please, come on in.
Come in, it's over here.
See what they did?
I mean, all gone.
All of them.
- Just...
- What's all gone?
I have...
I had a baseball card collection.
- A major collection, all stolen.
- Sorry to hear that.
Was it common knowledge that you have baseball cards?
No, not really.
So nobody in particular you can think of wanted them?
No, not that I...
No.
- How'd they get in?
- The back door over here.
It was open when I came home for lunch.
I mean, it was locked... but they must have jimmied it open or something.
What time you figure this happened?
I left for work at 8:15, came home for lunch at 12:30...
- and called you immediately.
- Was anything else taken?
- Cash, a fair bit.
- How much cash?
I don't know.
You know, let's focus on what's important here.
You know, all I really care about are my baseball cards.
I have a Topps Mickey Mantle rookie card that's irreplaceable.
It's a mint, 60-40, 90-10 on the reverse.
I can go on.
All my cards are in top-loaders... but if they're taken out and exposed to the elements...
I mean, or creased, God forbid...
I mean, you're looking at a 9-point downgrade in a matter of seconds.
I understand the first 48 hours are most important in investigations like this... so the more time passes, I mean, the less likely we are of a recovery.
So time is of the essence here, guys.
Well, we're gonna help you out the best we can, Mr. Wormald.
Good.
They really tossed this place.
Are you sure they weren't looking for anything else?
- Like what?
- I don't know.
Just wondering your thoughts.
I assume more baseball cards.
Did you have more than the ones in the case here?
Yes, in back.
Thousands.
But these were the crown jewels over here.
You know, the all-star lineup.
Right.
- What?
- Just trying to make sense of it.
What's to make sense of?
I mean, isn't it as simple as the perp was looking for more baseball cards?
Or hopped up on speed or whatever and went nuts with the vandalism?
Yeah.
I mean, that could be, yeah.
Pretty sweet Hummer parked in the driveway.
That yours?
Yeah, that's mine.
It's a lease.
Got a great deal on it.
It's very sweet.
They say Arnold Schwarzenegger's the reason that Hummers exist.
- Don't know how, but that's what they say.
- No kidding?
What kind of work do you do, Mr. Wormald?
I work IT... for a pharmaceutical company.
Wow, computers.
God, I should've gotten into computers.
- I'd have that same Hummer.
- Right.
Look, guys, I'm glad you like my car... but I think we're looking through the wrong end of the telescope here.
- The priority is my baseball cards.
- Of course.
Yes, now, I have a detailed manifest of my entire collection... and asterisks next to the high-ticket items.
It's clear which ones they'll try to fence first... because they're super, super valuable.
So you're gonna wanna get this list out to pawn shops, collectors.
Question anyone who's done any sort of crime like this in the past.
You know, the usual suspects.
Can I get you the list so you can start investigating?
- Yeah, if you could get us that list...
- Okay, I'll print it out.
Hank Aaron, mint.
God, my signed Derek Jeter.
Willy Mays, O-Pee-Chee.
Gotta breathe.
Just keep breathing, keep breathing.
- Okay.
- I know, right?
Left the TV...
- left the computer.
- Right.
There's something wrong with this picture.
Hey, it's me.
Another perfect day in paradise out here.
I'm in the pool.
Okay, call me.
- Hi, how are you?
- Hey, babe, did you get lunch?
I did.
- I think I'm burning up back here.
- Oh, really?
- You're just in luck.
Look what I have.
- Oh, hey, great.
- Oh, yeah, you're all red back here.
- Yeah.
I feel stupid.
I told you not to spend so much time in the sun.
You don't listen.
Yeah, it's me again.
Listen, as I speak, not 25 feet away from me...
I'm looking at the mark.
Think Thurston Howell III if he shacked up with Ginger.
He's dripping in Gucci.
It's like I'm at the watering hole... and I'm watching the fattest, slowest water buffalo... expose his neck to me, and I'm the lioness ready to strike.
Come, Kim, join me.
Join the pride.
I said "lioness" because it's the females who do all the hunting.
I just wanted to be species-accurate... irrespective of my own sex, it's a National Geographic thing.
Anyway... get out here.
Bye.
Santa Fe, New Mexico.
I need the number of a law firm, Davis Main.
Yeah, you can connect me.
There are a few options on the company cars.
We can arrange a test drive whenever you'd like.
Company car, wow.
And there's a service that will deliver it right to you, wherever you want.
And if you find you're not happy with it, it's not a big deal to change it out.
That sounds really...
Yeah.
This is interesting.
Oh, if this isn't to your taste... we have a collection of art in-house you can choose from.
Any time you're ready, I can put together some samples for you to review.
I...
I...
I like this.
Good.
Well, any other needs you have, I'm here to help.
Office supplies, dietary needs.
Anything special you want stocked in the fridge?
Maybe a humidifier?
- Gets kind of dry in here.
- Omar, I'm pretty low maintenance.
Sure.
Well, if there's anything you need, I'm right outside the door.
- Great.
If I think of anything.
- Okay.
Hey, do you think...?
I'm just looking at this.
Do we get a choice of desks?
What were you thinking?
Is it possible...?
Can we do a cocobolo?
Cocobolo desk?
Absolutely.
I'll get right on that.
Good night, ladies.
Get home safe.
KRISTA:
See you later, Gene.
RAQUEL:
Good night.

All right.
Here he is.
HOWARD:
Oh, great.
Jimmy, right on time.
Good to see you.
Hello, Howard.
Hey.
Hi.
James McGill, Clifford Main.
Just "Jimmy." And it's a pleasure to meet you, Clifford.
Likewise.
We know all about your work on Sandpiper.
Well, it's a group effort.
I mean, the folks at HHM are just knockin' it out of the park.
Well, we know the case wouldn't exist without you.
Absolutely.
Once you get him on your team, you'll know why I call him "Charlie Hustle."
Jimmy, these are my associates, Brian Archuleta, and Erin Brill.
Hello.
Nice to meet you both.
It's great to meet you.
I hate to do this, but could I borrow Ms. Wexler for a moment?
If you will excuse us?
(CLEARS THROAT) Pardon me.
(CHUCKLES)
What's going on?
I just... (CLEARS THROAT) Listen, here's the thing.
If I take this job, does that mean the two of us...
I mean...
Uh, does it mean...
What?
What the hell is this?
If I take this job today, with Davis and Main, does that mean that you and me...
Is this, is this gonna happen?
Jimmy.
I...
I... (SIGHS)
One thing has absolutely nothing to do with the other.
Nothing at all.
No.
Of course not.
Why would it?
Great. (SIGHS)
Uh...
Sorry about that.
Listen, I just want to say thank you, sincerely, for your interest in me.
It's an honor to be considered, but at this time...
At this time, um,
I'm gonna have to take myself out of the running.
Thanks.
Thank you, Howard.
Uh, Jimmy?
MIKE:
Well, that was quick.
No charge.
Help me out here.
Did I dream it, or did I have $1,600,000 on my desk, in cash?
No one on God's green Earth knew we had it.
We could've split it 50-50.
We could've gone home with $800,000 each.
Tax-free.
Your point being?
Why didn't we?
I remember you saying something about doing the right thing.
You want to know why I didn't take that money?
Is that what you're asking?
Yeah, that's what I'm asking.
Me, personally, I was hired to do a job.
I did it.
That's as far as it goes.
Yeah.
Well, I know what stopped me.
And you know what?
It's never stopping me again.
(TIRES SQUEALING)
(HUMMING)
Chao cac co, ladies.
Chao cac co.
Mrs. Nguyen, it's a beautiful day out there.
You should get out of this place once in a while.
You know, throw a Frisbee, have some fun.
I have a business to run.
Uh, no.
The business is running you.
Listen to me.
You'll thank me later.
(SIGHS)
Cucumber water for customer only.

(WOMEN GIGGLING)
(SPEAKING IN VIETNAMESE)
(HUMMING)
(TIRES SQUEALING)
Hey.
It's me.
Hello?
Hello?
It's me.
I got a new car.
You like it?
We're not taking that to the meet.
How are we gonna get there?
I'll drive.
My car.
Why?
This business requires restraint.
That is the opposite of restraint.
But I like it.
I mean, I'm proud of it.
Good.
Then you be proud of it on your own time, but not with me.
I'm not getting in that.
Okay.
Then don't.
Honestly, you don't really do anything.
I've been paying you the salary of three people to just stand behind me.
You know?
And these last few deals...
This Nacho fella, he's been comin' alone.
I mean, if he doesn't need backup men, then, I mean, why do I need you?
I should just go alone.
I'm throwing...
I'm throwing away money.
Just tossing it away into the trash.
Look, you do whatever you want, but I'm advising you, do not go to that meet without someone watching your back.
Yeah, well, of course you're gonna say that.
I mean, you don't want to be out of this easy-peasy job.
Well, I'm sorry, but this is the gravy train, and it's leaving the station right now.
So, last chance.
All aboard.
Seriously, last chance.
I'm gonna count to, say, 10, and then I'm...
All right, then.
Your services are no longer needed.
(VEHICLE APPROACHING)
Hola.
No old guy?
What, did he break a hip or something?
(CHUCKLES) I know, right?
Yeah, no, we...
We parted ways.
Yeah, saw things differently.
So...
You know how it is.
This is interesting.
Oh, yeah.
You like it?
Can I take a look?
Oh, be my guest.
Get in.
(CHUCKLES) Check it out.
Wow.
Impressive.
PRYCE:
Thank you.
Get in.
Feel the leather.
Yeah, it's a H2.
Brand-new, off the line.
Slimmer than the H1, but longer, more height.
Yeah, it's a honey.
V8 engine, 325 horsepower, tri-zone climate controls.
So, you can have a girl in a bikini and another in a parka, and they're both gonna be comfortable.
(LAUGHING)
You're running around with two girls in your SUV?
You'd be really comfortable, huh?
Oh, yeah.
Yes.
(CHUCKLES)
I'm gonna count this quick.
Do your thing.
Make sure it's right.
PRYCE:
Okey-dokey.
We are good.
Uh, same as before.
Still factory-sealed.
And, as always, you're welcome to count 'em.
I trust you.
Great.
Thank you.
See you next time.
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
Hello?
Yes.
No.
Sorry.
Uh...
Yes, this is James McGill, but I'm no longer a lawyer, so...
That's right, not a lawyer.
Bye.
(SIGHS)
So, this is what a midlife crisis looks like?
Not midlife crisis.
Clarity.
Midlife clarity.
Clarity?
Uh...
Clearly explain to me why you walked out on the best job opportunity of your life.
(SIGHS)
Get in the pool, and I'll tell ya.
Get in the pool?
(CHUCKLES) Yeah.
Come on.
Just pop in the gift shop and buy a bathing suit.
Get a one-piece, nothing fancy.
The water is perfect.
It's 82 degrees.
You can order a drink.
And you got to try this crab dip...
Why are you acting like this?
I'm not acting like anything.
I just finally decided to be me.
Everything okay, Mr. Cumpston?
Would you like another drink?
No, I'm good with this.
I'll tell you what, Mr. Cumpston.
If you really want to talk, I'll be in the bar.
Not for long.
Hey, Rolando.
Check.
What...
What do you mean, "quit the law"?
I quit it.
Simple as that.
Oh, well, thanks for explaining, Jimmy.
It's super-clear now.
Hey, buddy?
Is that a misprint right there?
It's got to be, right?
The Zafiro Anejo?
Yeah.
That's correct, actually, believe it or not.
Holy shit.
A $50 shot of tequila?
Is it worth it?
Apparently.
I mean, it's kind of a personal choice kind of thing.
Well, I can't die without trying a $50 shot of tequila, so, two, dos, neat.
And we can charge that to the room, can't we?
No, we can't.
We...
I am paying.
And he will be having a shot of your well brand, and I'll have a glass of your house red.
We have a Cabernet, a Pinot, and a Syrah.
Whatever.
Dealer's choice.
Something with alcohol.
You got it.
Jimmy.
Did something happen in Cicero?
Why did something have to happen in Cicero?
Because when I talked to you about Davis and Main, you were ready to take the job.
Now you're back, and you're suddenly quitting the law, cheating hotels out of expensive liquor, wearing a weird pinkie ring?
What, are you in the Mafia now?
Asking if we have a future.
I mean, where did that come from?
I don't know.
I just...
Well, Cicero has nothing to do with it.
It's my whole life.
Well, my life since Chuck made me come to Albuquerque.
Ever since I got here, all I've done is try to make Chuck happy, bend over backwards to please Chuck.
Chuck, Chuck, Chuck.
Well, no more.
You quitting the law, isn't that exactly what Chuck wants?
Who cares?
This is for me, okay?
I got into the law for all the wrong reasons.
I'm trusting my instincts.
I think that my talents are better spent elsewhere.
Where?
Floating in somebody else's pool?
(SCOFFS)
Jimmy, you're a great lawyer.
Why give that up?
I'm not saying it didn't have its moments, but the stuff I liked about it, selling people, convincing people,
I don't have to be a lawyer to do that.
Besides, people tell me how they see me, and it's not as a lawyer.
All right.
Here you go.
KIM:
Thank you.
Let me know if I can get you guys anything else, okay?
KEN:
Bobby, what up, brother man?
KIM:
Thanks.
Short it.
Short it.
Short it.
Short that shit.
That stock is useless.
It's got no legs.
It's like a circus freak minus the fun.
And that one's even worse.
Who's giving you these?
Please do me a favor.
Take a pillow, put it over that stock's face until you hear the deathbed queef.
Okay, so...
If you're not gonna be a lawyer, then what?
Float around and wait for your Sandpiper money to roll in?
No.
That could take years.
Sandpiper has no bearing on this at all.
Okay, then, what's the plan?
To be open to the universe.
Okay, so no plan.
Just walk the Earth, like Jules at the end of Pulp Fiction?
Look, whatever the universe presents, whatever opportunity arises,
I will take it.
Whatever opportunity?
Yeah.
Wasn't Davis and Main an opportunity?
It's a great opportunity, and you're walking away from it.
Look, shouldn't you at least try the job before you say no?
And waste everyone's time, including my own?
Kim, I appreciate your concern, but it's not for me.
I don't want it.
Jimmy, do you remember how long you studied for that bar?
How hard you worked?
Yeah.
All that effort, you're just gonna toss it away?
That's the sunk cost fallacy.
Wait, the what?
The fallacy of sunk cost.
It's what gamblers do.
They throw good money after bad thinking they can turn their luck around.
It's like, "I've already spent this much money or time, whatever.
"I got to keep going."
No, there's no reward at the end of this game.
You are making a mistake.
I know you're making a mistake.
I've been doing the right thing for all these years now, and where has it gotten me?
Nowhere.
I'm sorry.
I don't...
KEN:
It's not my thing.
I don't get it.
I just don't get it.
It's what's right for me.
(KEN LAUGHING) Donkey balls.
Pure donkey balls, dude.
Wall Street's for suckers.
Who needs that aggravation?
If the Oracle doesn't have to live there, then I sure as hell don't.
I can make a million-dollar stock trade on my laptop sitting on a toilet.
Like Midas, shitting gold bricks on my throne.
That's why Speigelman and Deitch want my business so bad.
I'm a golden God.
Look, of course I remember that.
Who forgets a thing like that?
That fart had the anger of a repressed minority community.
You fart like that in someone's face, you're gonna give them pink eye for life.
(KEN LAUGHING)
Good convo, bro.
Till next time, brother man.
Come with me.
What?
Just come on.
Trust me.
What are you gonna do?
You want to understand what I'm talking about?
Follow my lead.
Hey, buddy, could you settle a bet for us?
A what?
Sorry.
I don't want to make it sound like I was eavesdropping, but I kind of was.
We heard you talking about stocks.
Uh-huh.
Yeah, so, a question, if you could settle a debate between me and my sister.
All right.
You know what?
We probably shouldn't even bother this man.
We wouldn't normally do this, right?
But we need an expert.
This guy sounds like he knows his stuff.
Yeah, go.
Okay.
Here's the question.
When it comes to the stock market, is there, like, a financial limit to how much a person's allowed to invest?
A limit?
No.
No limit.
Knew it.
Oh, even if it's an inheritance?
You know, with, like, inheritance taxes and whatnot?
No.
Same.
That's, oh, fantastic.
Thank you, buddy.
See?
No limit.
Told you we could invest it all.
And it's a smart move, too.
Sticking it all in the bank?
No.
Um, yeah.
You can invest all your money.
Just make sure you diversify.
Yeah.
Diversify.
(FLAPS LIPS) That's...
We got to...
Hey, what do you mean, "diversify"?
Well, diversify is...
You know that saying,
"Don't put all your eggs in one basket," right?
Same principle.
No, it makes complete sense.
Thank you.
Now, if I had an idea of the money we're talking about, ballpark,
I could give you examples of smart diversification.
Yeah, um...
Look, an uncle on our father's side recently passed, and he left us somewhere in the neighborhood of $1.4 million.
And I don't mean to be greedy, but I think if we invest it smart now, we could double it, triple it, we could quadruple the whole inheritance, right?
In my opinion?
Fortune favors the bold, man.
Now, if you guys are free to join me for a drink,
I can give you a quick consult.
That's all right.
We were gonna do it ourselves through one of those online brokerage websites.
We're just gonna pick a classic, like,
I think they're called blue-chip stocks?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you can totally do it yourself.
Shoot for the tried and true.
'Course, you might be putting your cash in the Hindenburg, the Andrea Doria, Corky Romano.
Right?
They all seemed rock-solid beforehand, but then...
Yeah, not good.
Not good, yeah.
So, how do you know?
Well, that's where someone like myself comes in.
Proven track record as a wealth manager.
I take calculated but aggressive risks 'cause I want to catch lightning.
And I do.
Practically a money-printing machine.
That sounds good.
A money-printing machine.
Listen, there's a little booth over here.
There's some privacy.
We can talk.
No obligations.
We can just rap about this a little bit.
Yeah, I guess.
Yeah?
What do you say, sis?
Can we just talk?
KEN:
Electric slide on in there.
And we'll just rap a little bit.
It's no...
My name's Ken, by the way.
Uh, Viktor, with a "K."
Cool.
Viktor with a "K."
And this lovely lady is?
It's Giselle.
Giselle Saint Claire.
Ah, lovely.
Please, sit.
I won't bite.
So, Viktor with a "K" and Giselle...
Exotic names.
JIMMY:
They're Dutch.
Well, Boer, to be precise.
Our father's side of the family is from South Africa, which is where Uncle Humphrey passed away.
Oh, South Africa.
They grow them beautiful down there, right?
Charlize Theron.
And you.
Oh, well... (SCOFFS)
I've never actually been, but hope to go someday.
KEN:
Tell you what, by the time I'm done with you two, you might be taking your own private jet.
Nice.
Excuse me.
Hi.
Uh, we are sitting here now, so we could use a wine list, if you get a chance...
Hey, are you a tequila fan?
Yes.
You down for that?
You ever try Zafiro Anejo?
No, I have not, but I'm down for whatever.
Three of whatever she just said.
You got it.
All right.
So, stock market.
A great investment.
And you're picking the right time to jump in.
JIMMY:
Why do you listen to me?
I'm an idiot.
(KEN LAUGHING)
And talks about his cars, talks about...
KEN:
How many cars did he have?
KIM:
I don't think...
(JIMMY LAUGHING)
KIM:
It doesn't make sense.
That's it, Ken.
Oh, yeah.
WAITER:
Compliments of the bartender.
She thought you might want a souvenir.
Oh, my God.
Did we drink the entire bottle?
Not yet, we didn't.
(BOOING) Hey, hey, cheers.
I think we're ready for the check.
(LAUGHING)
(COUGHING)
Oh!
Now, really, it's the smart way to go.
KIM:
Okay.
But, so, to be clear, you take the money directly from our account and invest it.
Diversify.
Diversify it.
And then all the dividends and all the profits and the what-have-you comes back into our account.
Boom, absolutely.
And you'll get a detailed statement showing you how much your money is growing, biggest bulls of the month, et cetera.
Ken, buddy, let's do this.
Great.
Right there, Viktor with a "K," and, Giselle, you are next.
This is so exciting.
Mmm-hmm.
Folks, it's been a pleasure.
Oops, I got that.
Can't let you do it, son.
JIMMY:
Wait.
What?
Ken, you are the greatest.
Thank you.
No problemo.
Hey, this will be the best decision you'll ever make.
KIM:
Oh, I believe it.
All right, well, we should get out of your hair.
Yeah.
Wait, wait.
This is for you.
Now, that's got all my contact info.
Call me anytime with questions or anything at all.
Ken.
Bye.
Call me, guys.
Bye.
Try and stop us.
Wow.
(CHUCKLES)
Just wow.
(SCOFFS)
(SIGHS)
Hey.
What...
Is this right?
Yes, sir, it is.
KIM:
Go, go, go, go, go.
(BOTH LAUGHING)
Zafiro Anejo.
Shh.
He's gonna come out.
Oh, no.
I didn't read the fine print.
Wait.
Yeah.
Holy crap.
I can't...
(LAUGHING)
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
(EXHALES)
(WATER RUNNING)
Can I borrow that when you're done?
No, that's gross.
How is it gross?
Our germs have already intermingled.
It's my toothbrush.
It's different.
(SPITS)
Why is it different?
Because.
You know, gums bleed, and there's...
There's cold sores, all sorts of food and...
Come on.
What?
No.
Come on.
I'll do it right now.
I don't care.
I need to brush my teeth.
I don't have an extra.
It's not my problem.
That's fine.
I got this.
Good.
I'm fine with this.
Yeah, me, too.
Wait till you see what I floss with.
(CHUCKLES)
That's a keeper.
(LAUGHING)
Thank you, Viktor with a "K."
(CLICKS TONGUE)
Hey, wouldn't it be great if we could do that every night?
Yes, it would.
But we can't.
I know, yeah.
But I'm just saying, if we could, it would be great.
But I know we can't.
Oh, crap.
I can't be late today.
Howard is doling out assignments, and the last one through the door could get stuck in doc review.
You got somewhere to go?
Yeah.
Uh, yeah, I got somewhere.
You good?
(SIGHS) Yeah.
All good.
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
Daniel Wormald?
I'm Officer Baker.
This is Officer Saxton.
Yeah, please.
Come on in.
Come in.
It's over here.
See what they did?
I mean, all gone.
All of them, just...
Uh...
What's all gone?
I have...
I had a baseball card collection.
A major collection, all stolen.
Oh, sorry to hear that.
Was it common knowledge that you have baseball cards?
No, not really.
So, nobody in particular you can think of wanted 'em?
No.
Not that I...
No.
How'd they get in?
Uh, the back door over here.
It was open when I came home for lunch.
I mean, it was locked, but they must have jimmied it open or something.
Uh-huh.
At what time you figure this happened?
PRYCE:
I left for work at 8:15, came home for lunch at 12:30, and called you immediately.
Was anything else taken?
Cash, a fair bit, uh...
How much cash?
PRYCE:
Uh, I don't know.
Let's focus on what's important here.
You know, all I really care about are my baseball cards.
You know, I have a Topps Mickey Mantle rookie card that's irreplaceable.
It's a mint, 60/40, 90/10 on the reverse.
I can go on.
All my cards are in top-loaders, but if they're taken out and exposed to the elements,
I mean, or creased, God forbid.
I mean, you're looking at a nine-point downgrade in a matter of seconds.
I understand the first 48 hours are the most important in investigations like this.
So, the more time passes,
I mean, the less likely we are of a recovery.
So, time is of the essence here, guys.
Well, we're gonna help you out the best we can, Mr. Wormald.
Good.
Well, they really tossed this place.
(SCOFFS)
I mean, are you sure they weren't looking for anything else?
Like what?
I don't know.
Just wondering your thoughts.
I assume more baseball cards.
Did you have more baseball cards than the ones you keep locked in that case here?
Yes, in back.
Thousands.
But these were the crown jewels over here.
The all-star lineup.
Right.
Hmm.
What?
SAXTON:
Just trying to make sense of it.
What's to make sense of?
I mean, isn't it as simple as the perp was looking for more baseball cards?
Or hopped up on speed or whatever and went nuts with the vandalism?
Yeah.
I mean, that could be.
Yeah.
Pretty sweet Hummer parked in the driveway.
That yours?
Yeah, that's mine.
Uh, it's a lease.
Got a great deal on it.
It's very sweet.
They say Arnold Schwarzenegger is the reason that Hummers exist.
I don't know how, but that's what they say.
No kidding.
Yeah.
Uh...
What kind of work do you do, Mr. Wormald?
Uh, I work IT for a pharmaceutical company.
SAXTON:
Wow, computers.
God, I should've gotten into computers.
I'd have that same Hummer.
Yeah, right.
Look, guys, I'm glad you like my car.
But I think we're lookin' through the wrong end of the telescope here.
The priority is my baseball cards.
Of course.
Yes, now, I have a detailed manifest of my entire collection.
And asterisks next to the high-ticket items.
So, it's clear which ones they're gonna try to fence first.
'Cause they're super, super valuable.
So, you're gonna want to get this list out to pawnshops, uh, collectors.
Question anyone who's done any sort of crime like this in the past.
The usual suspects.
Uh, can I get you the list so you can start investigating?
Yeah, you...
Yeah, if you could get us that list...
Okay, I'll print it out.
Hank Aaron, mint.
God, my signed Derek Jeter.
Willie Mays, O-Pee-Chee.
Got to breathe.
Just keep breathing.
Keep breathing.
Okay.
I know, right?
Left the TV.
Uh-huh.
Left the computer.
Right.
Uh... (SCOFFS)
There's something wrong with this picture.

Hey, babe.
Did you get lunch?
I did.

I think I'm burning up back here.

Really?
Well, you're just in luck.
Look what I have.
MAN:
Oh, great.
(EXCLAIMS)
Oh, yeah, you're all red back here.
Yeah.
MAN:
That feels good, babe.
GIRL:
I told you not to spend so much time in the sun.
You don't listen.
Yeah, it's me again.
Listen, as I speak, not 25 feet away from me,
I'm looking at the mark.
Think Thurston Howell III if he shacked up with Ginger.
(CHUCKLES) He's dripping in Gucci.
It's like I'm at the watering hole and I'm watching the fattest, slowest water buffalo expose his neck to me.
And I'm the lioness ready to strike.
(CHUCKLES) Come, Kim, join me.
Join the pride.
Oh, I said "lioness" because it's the females who do all the hunting.
Uh, I just wanted to be species-accurate, irrespective of my own sex.
It's a National Geographic thing.
Anyway...
Get out here.
Bye.

There are a few options on the company cars.
We can arrange a test drive whenever you'd like.
Company car.
Wow.
And there's a service that will deliver it right to you, wherever you want.
And if you find you're not happy with it, it's not a big deal to change it out.
(CHUCKLES) That sounds really... (SIGHS) Yeah.
This is uh, interesting.
Oh, if... (CHUCKLES)
If this isn't to your taste, we have a collection of art in-house you can choose from.
Anytime you're ready, I can put together some samples for you to review.
I...
No, I like this.
Good.
Well, any other needs you have,
I'm here to help.
Office supplies, dietary needs...
Anything special you want stocked in the fridge?
Uh, maybe a humidifier?
Gets kind of dry in here.
Omar, I'm pretty low-maintenance.
Sure.
Well, if there's anything you need,
I'm right outside the door.
Great.
If I think of anything.
Good.
Hey, do you think...
Uh, I'm just looking at this.
Do we get a choice of desks?
What were you thinking?

Is it possible...
Um...
Can we do a cocobolo?
Cocobolo desk?
Absolutely.
I'll get right on that.

KIM:
Ah, here he is.
HOWARD:
Oh, great.
Jimmy, right on time.
Good to see you.
Hello, Howard.
Hey.
Hi.
James McGill, Clifford Main.
Just "Jimmy." And it's a pleasure to meet you, Clifford.
Likewise.
We know all about your work on Sandpiper.
Well, it's a group effort.
I mean, the folks at HHM are just knocking it out of the park.
Well, you know, the case wouldn't exist without you.
Absolutely.
Once you get him on your team, you'll know why I call him "Charlie Hustle."
Jimmy, these are my associates...
Brian Archuleta and Erin Brill.
- Nice to meet you both.
- It's great to meet you.
I hate to do this, but, um, could I borrow Ms. Wexler for a moment?
If you will excuse us?
[Clears throat] Pardon me.
[Chuckles]
What's going on?
I just, um [clears throat]
Listen, here's the thing.
If I take this job, does that mean the two of us...
I mean, uh...
Does it mean, uh...
What?
What...
What the hell is this?
If I take this job today, with Davis and Main [clears throat] does that mean that you and me...
Is this...
Is this gonna happen?
Jimmy, I...
I...
[Sighs]
One thing has absolutely nothing to do with the other.
Nothing at all.
No.
Of course not.
Why would it?
Great. [Sighs]
Uh, sorry about that.
Listen, I just want to say thank you, sincerely,
For your interest in me.
It's an honor to be considered,
But at this time...
At this time...
Um, I'm gonna have to take myself out of the running.
Thanks.
Thank you, Howard.
Uh, Jimmy?
[brakes screech]
Mike:
Well, that was quick.
No charge.
Help me out here.
Did I dream it,
Or did I have $1,600,000 on my desk in cash?
No one on god's green earth knew we had it.
We could've split it 50/50.
We could've gone home with $800,000... each!
Tax-free!
Your point being?
Why didn't we?
I remember you saying something about doing the right thing.
You want to know why I didn't take that money?
Is that what you're asking?
Yeah, that's what I'm asking.
Me, personally, I was hired to do a job.
I did it.
That's as far as it goes.
Yeah.
Well, I know what stopped me.
And you know what?
It's never stopping me again.

I have a business to run.
Uh, no.
The business is running you.
Listen to me.

Hey!
It's me!
[brake squeaks]
Geez.
Hello?
Hello?
It's me.
I got a new car.
You like it?
We're not taking that to the meet.
How are we gonna get there?
I'll drive.
My car.
Why?
This business requires restraint.
That is the opposite of restraint.
But...
I like it.
I mean, I'm proud of it.
Good.
Then you be proud of it on your own time, but not with me.
I'm not getting in that.
Okay.
Then... then don't.
Honestly, uh, you don't really do anything.
I've been paying you the salary of three people to just stand behind me.
You know?
And...
And these...
these last few deals...
This Nacho fella, he's been coming alone.
I mean, if he doesn't need backup men, then, I mean, why do I need you?
I should just go alone.
I'm throwing...
I'm throwing away money.
Just tossing it away.
Into the trash.
Look, you do whatever you want, but I'm advising you...
do not go to that meet without someone watching your back.
Yeah, well, of course you're gonna say that.
I mean, you don't want to be out of this easy-peasy job.
Well, I'm sorry, but this is the gravy train, and it's leaving the station right now.
So last chance.
All aboard.
Seriously, last chance.
I'm gonna count to, say, 10, and then I'm...
All right, then.
Your services are no longer needed!
[Bird cawing]
[Engine shuts off]
Hola.
No old guy?
What, did he break a hip or something?
[Chuckles] I know, right?
Yeah, no, we, uh...
We... we parted ways.
Yeah, saw things differently.
So...
You know how it is.
This is interesting.
Oh, yeah.
You like it?
Can I take a look?
Oh.
Be my guest.
Get in.
[Chuckles] Check it out.
Wow.
Impressive.
Thank you.
Get in.
Feel the leather.
Yeah, it's a H2.
Brand-new off the line.
Slimmer than the H1 but longer, more height.
Yeah, it's a honey.
V-8 engine, 325 horsepower, tri-zone climate controls.
So you can have a girl in a bikini and another in a parka, and they're both gonna be comfortable. [Chuckles]
You're running around with two girls in your S.U.V., you'd be really comfortable, huh?
Oh, yeah.
Yes.
[Chuckles]
I'm gonna count this quick.
Do your thing.
Make sure it's right.
Okeydokey.
We are good.
Uh, same as before.
Uh, still factory-sealed.
And, as always, you're welcome to count them.
I trust you.
Great.
Thank you.
See you next time.
[Door closes]
[Cellphone ringing]
[Cellphone beeps]
Hello?
Yes.
Uh, no.
Sorry.
But...
Yes, this is James McGill, but I'm no longer a lawyer, so...
That's right... not a lawyer.
Bye.
[Cellphone beeps]
[Sighs]
So, this is what a midlife crisis looks like?
Not midlife crisis.
Clarity.
Midlife clarity.
Clarity?
Huh.
Clearly explain to me why you walked out on the best job opportunity of your life.
[Sighs]
Get in the pool, and I'll tell ya.
Get in the pool?
[Chuckling] Yeah.
Come on.
Just pop in the gift shop and buy a bathing suit... get a one-piece, nothing fancy.
The water is perfect.
It's 82 degrees.
You can order a drink.
And you got to try this crab dip.
Why are you acting like this?
I'm not acting like anything.
I just... finally decided to be me.
Everything okay, Mr. Cumpston?
Would you like another drink?
Uh, I'm good with this.
I'll tell you what, Mr. Cumpston.
If you really want to talk, I'll be in the bar.
Not for long.
Hey, Rolando.
Check.
What do...
What do you mean "quit the law"?
- [ "Buena Vista" plays in background]
- I quit it.
Simple as that.
Oh, well, thanks for explaining, Jimmy.
- It's super-clear now.
- Hey, buddy?
Uh, is that a misprint right there?
It's got to be, right?
- The Zafiro Anejo?
- Yeah.
That's correct, actually, believe it or not.
Holy shit.
A $50 shot of tequila?
Is it worth it?
Apparently.
I mean, it's kind of a personal-choice kind of thing.
Well, I can't die without trying a $50 shot of tequila, so, uh... two... dos... neat.
And, uh, we can charge that to the room, can't we?
No, we can't.
We...
I am paying.
And he will be having a shot of your well brand, and I'll have a glass of your house red.
We have a Cabernet, a Pinot, and a Syrah.
Whatever.
Dealer's choice.
Something with alcohol.
You got it.
[Sighs]
Jimmy... did something happen in Cicero?
Why did something have to happen in Cicero?
Because when I talked to you about Davis Main, you were ready to take the job.
Now you're back, and you're suddenly quitting the law, cheating hotels out of expensive liquor, wearing a weird pinkie ring?
What, are you in the Mafia now?
Asking if we have a future.
I mean, where did that come from?
I don't know.
I just...
Well, Cicero has nothing to do with it.
It's my whole life.
Well, my life since Chuck made me come to Albuquerque.
Ever since I got here, all I've done is try to make Chuck happy, bend over backwards to please Chuck.
Chuck, Chuck, Chuck.
Well, no more.
You quitting the law... isn't that exactly what Chuck wants?
Who cares?
This is for me, okay?
I-I got into the law for all the wrong reasons.
I'm trusting my instincts.
I think that my talents are better spent elsewhere.
Where?
Floating in somebody else's pool?
- [Scoffs] - [Sighs]
Jimmy, you're a great lawyer.
Why give that up?
I'm not saying it didn't have its moments, but the stuff I liked about it... selling people, convincing people...
I don't have to be a lawyer to do that.
Besides, people tell me how they see me, and it's not as a lawyer.
All right.
Here you go.
Thank you.
Lemme know if I can get you guys anything else, okay?
KEN:
Bobby, what up, brother man?
Oh, thanks.
Short it.
Short it.
Short it.
Short that shit.
That stock is useless.
It's got no legs.
It's like a circus freak minus the fun.
And that one's even worse.
Who's giving you these?
Please do me a favor.
Take a pillow, put it over that stock's face until you hear the deathbed queef.
- KEN:
It's a loser.
- Okay, so... if you're not gonna be a lawyer, then what?
Float around and wait for your Sandpiper money to roll in?
No.
That could take years.
Sandpiper has no bearing on this at all.
Yeah, it's got legs.
Okay, then, what's the plan?
To be open to the universe.
Okay, so no plan.
Just walk the Earth, like Jules at the end of "Pulp Fiction"?
Look, whatever the universe presents, whatever opportunity arises, I will take it.
- Whatever opportunity?
- Yeah.
Wasn't Davis Main an opportunity?
It's a great opportunity, and you're walking away from it.
Not him, not the guy who...
Look, shouldn't you at least try the job before you say no?
And waste everyone's time, including my own?
Kim, I appreciate your concern, but it's not for me.
I don't want it.
Jimmy, do you remember how long you studied for that bar?
How hard you worked?
All that effort, you're just gonna toss it away?
That's the Sunk Cost Fallacy.
W...
The what?
The Fallacy of Sunk Cost...
It's what gamblers do.
They throw good money after bad thinking they can turn their luck around.
It's like, "I've already spent this much money or time... whatever.
I got to keep going!"
No, there's no reward at the end of this game.
You are making a mistake.
I know you're making a mistake.
I've been doing the "right" thing for all these years now, and where has it gotten me?
Nowhere.
I'm sorry.
I don't...
[Sighs]
[ "Transatlantic" plays in background]
It's not my thing.
I don't get it.
- I just don't get it.
- It's what's right for me.
[Laughs]
Donkey balls.
Pure donkey balls, dude.
Wall Street's for suckers.
Who needs that aggravation?
If the the Oracle doesn't have to live there, then I sure as hell don't.
I can make a million-dollar stock trade on my laptop sitting on a toilet.
Like Midas, shitting gold bricks on my throne.
That's why Speigelman and Deitch want my business so bad.
I'm a golden God.
Look, of course I remember that.
Who forgets a thing like that?
That fart had the anger of a repressed minority community.
You fart like that in someone's face, you're gonna give them pinkeye for life.
[Laughs]
Good convo, bro.
Till next time, brutha-man.
- Flip side.
On it.
- Come with me.
- What?
- Just come on.
Trust me.
What are you gonna do?
You want to understand what I'm talking about?
Follow my lead.
[Indistinct conversations]
Hey, buddy, could you settle a bet for us?
- I what?
- Uh, sorry.
I don't want to make it sound like I was eavesdropping, but I kind of was.
Uh, we heard you talking about stocks.
Uh-huh.
Yeah, so, question... if you could settle a debate between me and my sister.
Uh, you know what?
We probably shouldn't be bothering this...
We wouldn't normally do this...
Right?
but we need an expert.
This guy sounds like he knows his stuff.
Yeah, go.
Okay.
Here's the question.
Uh, when it comes to the stock market, is there, like, a financial limit to how much a person's allowed to invest?
A limit?
No.
No limit.
Knew it.
Oh, even if it's an inheritance?
You know, with, like, inheritance taxes and whatnot?
Nope.
Same.
That's...
Oh, fantastic.
Thank you, buddy.
See?
No limit.
Told you we could invest it all.
And it's a smart move, too.
Sticking it all in the bank?
No.
Um, yeah.
You can... invest all your money.
Just make sure you diversify.
Yeah.
Diversify.
[Clicks tongue] That's...
You got to...
Oh, hey, um...
What do you mean, "diversify"?
Well, diversify is...
Y-You know that saying,
"Don't put all your eggs in one basket," right?
Same principle.
No, it makes complete sense.
Thank you.
Now, if I had an idea of the money we're talking about...
Ballpark...
I could give you examples of smart diversification.
[Sighs] Yeah, um...
Look, an uncle on our father's side recently passed, and he left us somewhere in the neighborhood of $1.4 million.
And I don't mean to be greedy, but I think, if we invest it smart now, we could double it, triple it... we could quadruple the whole inheritance, right?
In my opinion?
Fortune favors the bold, man.
Now, if you guys are free to join me for a drink,
I can give you a quick consult.
That's all right.
We were gonna do it ourselves through one of those online brokerage websites.
We're just gonna pick, uh, a classic, like...
I think they're called blue-chip stocks?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you can totally do it yourself.
Shoot for the tried and true.
'Course, you might be putting your cash in the Hindenburg, the Andrea Doria, uh..."Corky Romano."
- [Chuckles]
- Right?
They all seemed rock-solid beforehand, but then...
Yeah, not good.
Not good, yeah.
So, how do you know?
Well, that's where someone like myself comes in.
Proven track record as a wealth manager.
I take calculated but aggressive risks 'cause I want to catch lightning.
And I do.
Practically a money-printing machine.
[Chuckling] That sounds good.
A money-printing machine.
Listen, there's a little booth over here.
There's some privacy.
We can talk.
No obligations.
We can just... just rap about this a little bit.
- Yeah, I guess.
- Yeah?
What do you say, sis?
Can we just talk?
Electric slide on in there.
And we'll just rap a little bit.
It's no...
My name's Ken, by the way.
Uh, Viktor, with a "K."
Cool.
Viktor with a "K."
And this lovely lady is?
It's...
Giselle.
Giselle Saint Claire.
Ah, lovely.
Please, sit.
I won't bite.
So, Viktor with a "K" and Giselle... exotic names.
JIMMY:
They're Dutch.
Well, Boer, to be precise.
Our... father's side of the family is from South Africa, which is where uncle Humphrey passed away.
South Africa.
They grow them beautiful down there, right?
Charlize Theron.
And you.
Oh.
Well...
I've never actually been, but hope to go someday.
Tell you what, by the time I'm done with you two, you might be taking your own private jet.
Nice.
Excuse me.
Hi.
Uh, we are sitting here now, so, uh, we could use a wine list, if you get a chance...
Hey, uh, are a tequila fan?
Yes.
You down for that?
You ever try Zafiro Anejo?
No, I have not, but I'm down for whatever.
Three of whatever she just said.
- You got it.
- All right.
So, stock market.
A great investment.
And you're picking the right time to jump in.
- [ "Goldigger" plays in background]
- Why do you listen to me?
I'm an idiot.
[Laughs]
And talks about his cars, talks about...
[Jimmy and Ken laugh]
- How many cars did he have?
- I don't think...
[Laughter]
- It doesn't make sense.
- That's it, Ken.
Oh, yeah.
Compliments of the bartender.
She thought you might want a souvenir.
Oh, my God.
Did we drink the entire bottle?
Not yet, we didn't.
- Boom.
- Hey, hey, cheers.
Uh, I think we're ready for the check.
[Laughter]
[Groans]
No, really, it's the smart way to go.
KIM:
Okay.
But, so, to be clear, you take the money directly from our account and invest it.
- Diversify.
- Diversify it.
And then all the dividends and all the profits and the...what-have-you comes back into our account.
Boom.
Absolutely.
And you'll get a detailed statement showing you how much your money is growing... biggest bulls of the month, et cetera.
Ken, buddy...
let's do this.
Great.
Right there, Viktor with a "K,"
and, Giselle, you are next.
- This is so exciting.
- Mm-hmm.
Folks, it's been a pleasure.
- Oops, I got that.
- Can't let you do it, son.
Wait.
What?
Ken, you are the greatest.
- Thank you.
- No problem-o.
Hey, this will be the best decision you'll ever make.
Oh, I believe it.
All right, well, we should get out of your hair.
- Yeah.
- Oh, wait, wait.
This... is for you.
Now, that's got all my contact info.
Call me anytime with questions or anything at all.
Ken.
Bye.
Call me, guys.
- Bye.
- Try and stop us.
[Laughs]
Wow.
[Chuckles]
Just wow.
[Inhales deeply]
[Chuckles]
[Exhales slowly]
Hey.
What I...
Is this right?
Yes, sir, it is.
- ["Music Wine" plays in background]
- KIM:
Go, go, go, go, go!
[Both laugh]
- Zafiro Anejo!
- Shh!
He's gonna come out. [Laughs]
Oh, no.
I didn't read the fine print.
- Wait.
- Yeah!
[Both laugh]
Holy crap.
I can't b...
[Laughing]
[Breathes deeply]
[Chuckles]
[Chuckles]
[Laughter, indistinct conversations]
[Water turns on]
Can I borrow that when you're done?
[Chuckles] No, that's gross.
H-how is it gross?
Our germs have already intermingled.
It's my toothbrush.
It's different.
Why is it different?
Because.
You know, gums bleed, and there's... there's cold sores, all sorts of food and weir...
Let me see that.
Come on.
What?
No!
Come on!
I'll do it right now.
- I don't care.
- I need to brush my teeth.
I don't have an extra.
It's not my problem.
That's fine.
I got this.
Good.
I'm fine with this.
Yeah, me too.
Wait till you see what I floss with.
[Laughing]
[Jewelry clattering]
That's a keeper.
[Chuckles] Thank you, Viktor with a "K."
Hey, wouldn't it be great if we could do that every night?
Yes, it would.
But...
We can't.
I know, yeah.
But I'm just saying, if we could, it would be great.
But I know we can't.
Oh, crap.
I can't be late today.
Howard is doling out assignments, and the last one through the door could get stuck in doc review.
You got somewhere to go?
Yeah.
Uh, yeah, I got somewhere.

Daniel Wormald?
I'm Officer Baker.
This is Officer Saxton.
Yeah, please.
Come on in.
Come in.
It's over here.
See what they did?
I mean, all gone.
All of them, just...
Uh, what's all gone?
I have...
I had a baseball-card collection... a major collection...
All stolen.
Oh, sorry to hear that.
Uh, was it common knowledge that you have baseball cards?
No, not really.
So, nobody in particular you can think of wanting them?
No.
Not that I...
No.
How'd they get in?
Uh, the back door over here.
It was open when I came home for lunch.
I mean, it was locked, but they must have jimmied it open or something.
Uh-huh.
At what time, uh, you figure this happened?
I left for work at 8:15, came home for lunch at 12:30, and called you immediately.
Was anything else taken?
Cash... a fair bit.
Uh, um...
How much cash?
Uh, I don't know.
You know, let's focus on what's important here, you know?
All I really care about are my baseball cards.
You know, I have a Topps Mickey Mantle rookie card that's irreplaceable.
It's a mint, 60/40, 90/10 on the reverse.
I can go on.
All my cards are in top-loaders, but if they're taken out and exposed to the elements,
I mean, or creased, God forbid,
I mean, you're looking at a 9-point downgrade in a matter of seconds.
I understand the first 48 hours are the most important in investigations like this, so the more time passes,
I mean, the less likely we are of a recovery.
So...time is of the essence here, guys.
Well, we're gonna help you out the best we can, Mr. Wormald.
Good.
Well...they really tossed this place.
-[Scoffs]
-I mean, are you sure they weren't looking for anything else?
Like what?
I don't know.
J-Just wondering your thoughts.
I assume more baseball cards.
Did you have more baseball cards than the ones you keep locked in that case here?
Yes, in... in back... thousands.
But these were the crown jewels over here.
You know, t-the all-star lineup.
Right.
Hmm.
What?
Just trying to make sense of it.
What's to make sense of?
I mean, isn't it as simple as the perp was looking for more baseball cards?
Or hopped up on speed or whatever and went nuts with the vandalism?
Yeah.
I mean, that could be.
Yeah.
Pretty sweet Hummer parked in the driveway.
That yours?
Yeah, that's mine.
Uh, it's a lease.
Got a great deal on it.
It's very sweet.
You know, they say Arnold Schwarzenegger is the reason that Hummers exist.
I don't know how, but that's what they say.
- No kidding.
- Yeah.
Huh.
What kind of work do you do, Mr. Wormald?
Uh, I work I.T., uh, for a pharmaceutical company.
Wow.
Computers.
God, I should've gotten into computers.
- I'd have that same Hummer.
- [Chuckles] Yeah, right.
Look, guys, I'm glad you like my car, but I think we're looking through the wrong end of the telescope here.
You know, the priority is my baseball cards.
Of course.
Yes, now, I have a detailed manifest of my entire collection and asterisks next to the high-ticket items, so it's clear which ones they're gonna try to fence first, 'cause they're super, super valuable.
So you're gonna want to get this list out to pawnshops, uh, collectors, question anyone who's done any sort of crime like this in the past.
You know, the... the usual suspects.
Uh, can I get you the list so you can start investigating?
Yeah, you...
Yeah, if you could get us that list...
Okay, I'll...
I'll print it out.
Hank Aaron, mint.
God, my signed Derek Jeter.
Willie Mays, O-Pee-Chee.
Got to breathe.
Just keep breathing.
Keep breathing.
- Okay.
- I know, right?
- Left the TV.
- Uh-huh.
- Left the computer.
- Right.
Huh.
There's something wrong with this picture.
[Printer whirring in distance]

[Dialing]
Hey, it's me.
Another perfect day in paradise out here.
I'm in the pool.
Okay, call me.
[Cellphone beeps]
- Hi!
How are you?
- Hey, babe.
Did you get lunch?
WOMAN:
I did.
MAN:
You know, I think I'm burning up back here.
Oh, really?
Well, you're just in luck.
- Look what I have.
- Oh, hey, great.
Oh, yeah, you're all red back here.
Yeah.
That feels good, babe.
- [Dialing]
- I told you not to spend so much time in the sun.
You don't listen.
Yeah, it's me again.
Listen, as I speak, not 25 feet away from me,
I'm looking at the mark.
Think Thurston Howell III if he shacked up with Ginger.
[Chuckles] He's dripping in Gucci.
It's like I'm at the watering hole, and I'm watching the fattest, slowest water buffalo expose his neck to me, and I'm the lioness ready to strike.
[Chuckles] Come, Kim.
Join me.
Join the pride.
Um, I said "lioness"
because it's the females who do all the hunting.
Uh, just wanted to be species-accurate, irrespective of my own sex.
It's a National Geographic thing.
Anyway...
Get out here.
Bye.
[Cellphone beeps]
[Lawnmower running in distance]
[Chuckles]
[Dialing]
Santa Fe, New Mexico.
I need the number of a law firm...
Davis Main.
Yeah, you can connect me.
[Indistinct conversations]
[Telephone rings in distance]
WOMAN:
Davis Main.
OMAR:
There are a few options on the company cars.
We can arrange a test-drive whenever you'd like.
Company car... wow.
And there's a service that will deliver it right to you, wherever you want.
And if you find you're not happy with it, it's not a big deal to change it out.
That sounds really, uh...
[Sighs] Yeah.
This is, uh, interesting.
Oh, if, uh... [Chuckles]
If this isn't to your taste, we have a collection of art in-house you can, uh, choose from.
Anytime you're ready,
I can put together some samples for you to review.
I...
I...
No, I like this.
Good.
Uh, well, any other needs you have, I'm here to help.
Office supplies, dietary needs...
Anything special you want stocked in the fridge?
Uh, maybe a humidifier?
Gets kind of dry in here.
Omar, I...
I'm pretty low-maintenance.
Sure.
Well, if there's anything you need,
I'm right outside the door.
Great.
If I think of anything.
Good.
Hey, do you think, um...
I'm just looking at this.
D-Do we get a choice of desks?
What were you thinking?
Um... is it possible, um...
Can we do... cocobolo?
Cocobolo desk?
Absolutely.
I'll get right on that.
[Chuckles]

No, no.
No!
No!
Goddamn it!
No.
Come on.
Hey!
Hey!
Somebody!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
...the problem with it is because they believe he's worth the problem of the National Football the football from a player that took place.
Those were attitudes I mean, there are plenty of rules in play...
You can go.
Ah.
Here he is.
Great.
Jimmy, right on time.
Good to see you.
Hello, Howard.
- Hey.
Hi.
- James McGill, Clifford Main.
Just Jimmy.
It's a pleasure to meet you, Clifford.
Likewise.
We know all about your work on Sandpiper.
Well, it's a group effort.
I mean, the folks at HHM are just knocking it out of the park.
- The case wouldn't exist without you.
- Absolutely.
Once you get him on your team, you'll know why I call him Charlie Hustle.
Jimmy, these are my associates, Brian Archuleta and Erin Brill.
- Nice to meet you both.
- Great to meet you.
I hate to do this but could I borrow Ms. Wexler for a moment?
- If you will excuse us...
- Ahem.
Pardon me.
- What's going on?
- I just...
Ahem.
Listen, here's the thing.
If I take this job, does that mean the two of us...?
I mean...
- Does it mean...?
- What?
What?
What the hell is this?
If I take this job today with Davis Main does that mean that you and me...?
Is this...
Is this gonna happen?
Jimmy.
I...
I...
One thing has absolutely nothing to do with the other.
- Nothing at all?
- No.
Of course not, why would it?
Great.
Uh...
Sorry about that.
Listen, I just wanna say thank you, sincerely, for your interest in me.
It's an honor to be considered, but at this time...
At this time I'm gonna have to take myself out of the running.
Thanks.
- Thank you, Howard.
- Uh...
Jimmy?
Well, that was quick.
- No charge.
- Help me out here.
Did I dream it or did I have $1,600,000 on my desk in cash?
No one on God's green earth knew we had it.
We could've split it fifty-fifty.
We could've gone home with $800,000 each tax free.
Your point being?
Why didn't we?
I remember you saying something about doing the right thing.
You wanna know why I didn't take that money?
Is that what you're asking?
Yeah, that's what I'm asking.
Me personally, I was hired to do a job I did it, that's as far as it goes.
Yeah, well I know what stopped me.
And you know what?
It's never stopping me again.
Chào các cô, ladies.
Mrs. Nguyen, it's a beautiful day out, you should get out once in a while.
Throw a Frisbee, have some fun.
I have a business to run.
No, the business is running you.
Listen to me.
You'll thank me later.
Cucumber water for customer only.
Hey, it's me.
Jesus.
Hello?
Hello?
It's me.
I got a new car.
You like it?
We're not taking that to the meet.
How are we gonna get there?
I'll drive my car.
- Why?
- This business requires restraint.
That is the opposite of restraint.
But I like it.
I mean, I'm proud of it.
Good, then you be proud of it on your own time.
But not with me, I'm not getting in that.
Okay, then don't.
Honestly, you don't really do anything.
I've been paying you the salary of three people to just stand behind me.
You know?
And these last few deals, this Nacho fella, he's been coming alone.
I mean, if he doesn't need backup men, then, I mean, why do I need you?
I should just go alone.
I'm throwing...
I'm throwing away money.
Just tossing it away into the trash.
Look, you do whatever you want, but I'm advising you do not go to that meet without someone watching your back.
Yeah, well, of course you're gonna say that.
I mean, you don't wanna be out of this easy-peasy job.
Well, I'm sorry, but this is the gravy train and it's leaving the station right now.
So last chance.
All aboard.
Seriously, last chance.
I'm gonna count to, say, 10, and then I'm...
All right, then, your services are no longer needed.
No old guy?
What, did he break a hip or something?
I know, right?
Yeah, no, we...
We parted ways.
Yeah, saw things differently, so...
You know how it is.
This is interesting.
Oh, yeah.
You like it?
- Can I take a look?
- Oh, be my guest.
Get in, check it out.
Wow.
- Impressive.
- Thank you.
Get in, feel the leather.
Yeah, it's a H2.
Brand-new off the line.
Slimmer than the H1, but longer, more height.
Yeah, it's a honey.
V8 engine, 325 horsepower.
Tri-zone climate controls, so you can have a girl in a bikini and another in a parka, and they're both gonna be comfortable.
Ha-ha.
You're riding around with two girls in your SUV.
- You'd be really comfortable, huh?
- Oh, yeah.
Yes.
I'm gonna count this quick.
Do your thing, make sure it's right.
Okey-dokey, we are good.
Same as before.
Still factory sealed.
And as always, you're welcome to count them.
I trust you.
Great, thank you.
See you next time.
Hello.
Yes.
No, sorry.
Yes, this is James McGill, but I'm no longer a lawyer, so...
That's right, not a lawyer.
Bye.
So this is what a midlife crisis looks like?
Not midlife crisis.
Clarity.
Midlife clarity.
Clarity?
Huh.
Clearly explain to me why you walked out on the best job opportunity of your life.
Get in the pool and I'll tell you.
- Get in the pool?
- Yeah, come on.
Pop in the gift shop and buy a bathing suit.
Get a one-piece, nothing fancy.
The water is perfect, it's 82 degrees.
You can order a drink, and you gotta try this crab dip.
- Why are you acting like this?
- I'm not acting like anything.
I just finally decided to be me.
Everything okay, Mr. Cumpston?
Would you like another drink?
I'm good with this.
I'll tell you what, Mr. Cumpston.
If you really wanna talk, I'll be in the bar.
Not for long.
Hey, Rolando, check.
What do you...
What do you mean, "quit the law"?
I quit it, simple as that.
Oh, well, thanks for explaining, Jimmy...
- ...it's super clear now.
- Hey, buddy?
Is that a misprint right there?
It's gotta be, right?
- The Zafiro Añejo?
- Yeah.
- That's correct, believe it or not.
- Holy shit, a $50 shot of tequila?
- Is it worth it?
- Apparently.
It's kind of a personal choice thing.
Well, I can't die without trying a $50 shot of tequila, so two.
Dos, neat, and we can charge that to the room, can't we?
No, we can't.
We...
I am paying.
And he will be having a shot of your well brand and I'll have a glass of your house red.
We have a cabernet, a pinot and a syrah.
Whatever, dealer's choice.
- Something with alcohol.
- You got it.
Jimmy.
Did something happen in Cicero?
Why did something have to happen?
When I talked to you about Davis Main,youwerereadytotakethejob .
Now you're back, and you're suddenly quitting the law?
Cheating hotels out of expensive liquor.
Wearing a weird pinkie ring.
What, are you in the Mafia now?
Asking if we have a future.
I mean, where did that come from?
I don't know, I just...
Cicero has nothing to do with it.
It's my whole life.
Well my life since Chuck made me come to Albuquerque.
Ever since I got here, all I've done is try to make Chuck happy.
Bend over backwards to please Chuck.
Chuck, Chuck, Chuck.
Well, no more.
You quitting the law, isn't that exactly what Chuck wants?
Who cares?
This is for me, okay?
I got into the law for all the wrong reasons.
I'm trusting my instincts.
I think that my talents are better spent elsewhere.
Where?
Floating in somebody else's pool?
Jimmy, you're a great lawyer.
Why give that up?
I'm not saying it didn't have its moments.
But the stuff I liked about it, selling people, convincing people I don't have to be a lawyer to do that.
Besides, people tell me how they see me...
- ...and it's not as a lawyer.
- All right.
- Here you go.
- Thank you.
Let me know if I can get you guys anything else.
- Bobby, what up, brother-man?
- Oh, thanks.
Short it.
Short it.
Short it.
Short that shit.
That stock is useless, it's got no legs.
It's like a circus freak minus the fun.
That one's even worse.
Who's giving you these?
Do me a favor.
Take a pillow put it over that stock's face until you hear the deathbed queef.
- Okay, so?
- It's a loser.
If you're not gonna be a lawyer, then what?
Float around and wait for your Sandpiper money to roll in?
- That could take years.
- Sandpiper has no bearing on this at all.
Okay, then, what's the plan?
- To be open to the universe.
- Okay, so no plan.
Just walk the earth?
Like Jules at the end of Pulp Fiction?
Look, whatever the universe presents, whatever opportunity arises...
- ...
I will take it.
- Whatever opportunity?
- Yeah.
- Wasn't Davis Main an opportunity?
It's a great opportunity, and you're walking away from it.
Look shouldn't you at least try the job before you say no?
And waste everyone's time, including my own?
Kim, I appreciate your concern but it's not for me.
I don't want it.
Jimmy, do you remember how long you studied for that bar?
- How hard you worked?
- It's like a burn victim...
All that effort, you're just gonna toss it away?
That's the sunk cost fallacy.
- The what?
- The fallacy of sunk cost.
It's what gamblers do, they throw good money after bad thinking they can turn their luck around.
It's like, "I've already spent this much money or time, whatever, I gotta keep going!"
No, there's no reward at the end of this game.
You are making a mistake.
I know you're making a mistake.
I've been doing the "right thing" and where has it gotten me?
- Nowhere.
- I'm sorry, I don't...
Yeah.
Not my thing.
Not my thing.
Still not my thing.
- I don't get it.
I just don't get it.
- It's what's right for me.
Ha-ha-ha.
Donkey balls.
Pure donkey balls, dude.
Wall Street's for suckers.
Who needs that aggravation?
If the Oracle doesn't have to live there, I don't.
I can make a million-dollar stock trade on my laptop sitting on a toilet.
Like Midas, shitting gold bricks on my throne.
That's why Spiegelman and Deitch want my business.
I'm a golden god.
Of course I remember.
Who forgets that?
That fart had the anger of a repressed minority community.
You fart like that in someone's face you're gonna give them pinkeye for life.
Ha-ha-ha.
Good convo, bro.
Till next time, brother-man.
- Flip side, on it, check you.
- Come with me.
- What?
- Just come on, trust me.
What are you gonna do?
You wanna understand what I'm talking about?
Follow my lead.
Hey, buddy, could you settle a bet for us?
- Can I what?
- Sorry I don't want it to sound like I was eavesdropping, but I kind of was.
We heard you talking about stocks.
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah, so question if you could settle a debate between me and my sister.
- We probably shouldn't bother...
- I wouldn't normally do this.
But we need an expert.
This guy sounds like he knows his stuff.
- Yeah, go.
- Okay, here's the question:
When it comes to the stock market, is there a financial limit to how much a person's allowed to invest?
A limit?
No, no limit.
Knew it!
Oh, even if it's an inheritance?
You know, with, like, inheritance taxes and whatnot?
- Nope, same.
- That's...
Oh, fantastic.
Thank you, buddy.
See, no limit.
Told you we could invest it all, and it's a smart move, too.
- Sticking it all in the bank?
No.
- Um...
Yeah, you can invest all your money, just make sure you diversify.
Yeah, diversify.
That's...
We gotta...
Hey what do you mean, "diversify"?
Well, diversify is...
You know the saying "don't put all your eggs in one basket"?
- Right?
Same principle.
- Makes complete sense.
Thank you.
If I had an idea of the money we're talking about, ballpark I could give you examples of smart diversification.
Yeah, um...
Look, an uncle on our father's side recently passed and he left us somewhere in the neighborhood of 1.4 million.
And I don't mean to be greedy, but I think if we invest it smart now we could double it, triple it we could quadruple the whole inheritance, right?
In my opinion?
Fortune favors the bold, man.
If you're free to join me for a drink, I can give you a consult.
That's all right, we'll do it ourselves through an online brokerage site.
We're just gonna pick classic...
Like, I think they're called blue chip stocks.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You can totally do it yourself.
Shoot for the tried and true.
Of course, you might be putting your cash in the Hindenburg, Andrea Doria Corky Romano.
Right?
They all seemed rock solid beforehand.
But then...
- Yeah, not good.
- Not good, yeah.
So how do you know?
Well, that's where someone like myself comes in.
Proven track record as a wealth manager.
I take calculated but aggressive risks because I wanna catch lightning, and I do.
- I'm practically a money-printing machine.
- That sounds good.
A money-printing machine.
Listen, there's a little booth over here, there's some privacy, we can talk.
No obligations, we can just rap about this a little bit.
- Yeah, I guess.
- Yeah?
What do you say, sis?
Can we just talk?
Electric slide on in there.
We'll rap a little, it's no...
- My name's Ken, by the way.
- Viktor, with a K.
Cool, Viktor with a K.
And this lovely lady is?
It's Giselle.
- Giselle Saint Claire.
- Ah.
Lovely.
Please, sit.
I won't bite.
So Viktor with a K and Giselle, exotic names.
- They're Dutch.
- Well, Boer to be precise.
Our father's side of the family is from South Africa which is where Uncle Humphrey passed away.
South Africa, they grow them beautiful down there, right?
Charlize Theron.
- And you.
- Oh, well.
I've never actually been, but hope to go someday.
Tell you what, when I'm done with you...
- ...you might take your own private jet.
- Nice.
Excuse me, hi.
We are sitting here now.
We could use a wine list if you get a chance...
Hey, are you a tequila fan?
Yes.
You down for that?
You ever try Zafiro Añejo?
No, I have not, but I'm down for whatever.
Three of whatever she just said.
- You got it.
- All right.
So stock market, a great investment and you're picking the right time to jump in.
Why do you listen to him?
He's an idiot.
He talks about his cars.
He talks about...
- How many cars did he have?
- I don't think...
- It makes sense.
- That's it, Ken.
Oh, yeah.
Compliments of the bartender.
Thought you might want a souvenir.
- My God, did we drink the entire bottle?
- Not yet, we didn't.
Right here.
Hey, hey, cheers.
I think we're ready for the check.
Oh...
No, really, it's a smart way to go.
Okay, but, so to be clear you take the money directly from our account...
- ...and invest it...
- Diversify it.
Diversify it.
And then all the dividends and all the profits and the what-have-you comes back into our account.
Boom.
Absolutely.
You'll get a statement showing how much your money is growing...
- ...biggest bulls of the month, etcetera.
- Ken, buddy let's do this.
Great.
Right there, Viktor with a K. And, Giselle, you are next.
- This is so exciting.
- Mm-hm.
- Folks, it's been a pleasure.
- Oops.
I got that.
- Can't let you do it, son.
- Wait, what?
Ken.
- You are the greatest.
Thank you.
- No problemo.
This will be the best decision you'll make.
We should get out of your hair.
- Yeah.
- Wait, wait, wait, this is for you.
Now, that's got all my contact info.
Call me anytime with questions, or anything at all.
- Ken.
- Bye.
Call me, guys.
- Bye.
- Try and stop us.
Wow.
Heh.
Just wow.
Hey.
What...?
- Is this right?
- Yes, sir, it is.
Go, go, go!
- Zafiro Añejo!
- Shh!
Shut up.
He's gonna come out.
- Oh, no, I didn't read the fine print.
- Wait!
Yeah!
- Holy crap.
- I can't...
Can I borrow that when you're done?
No, that's gross.
How is it gross?
Our germs have already intermingled.
It's my toothbrush, it's different.
- Why is it different?
- Because.
You know, gums bleed, and there's cold sores...
All sorts of food and weird...
- Come on.
- What?
No!
- Come on, I'll do it right now.
- I don't care.
- I need to brush my teeth.
- I don't have an extra.
That's fine.
I got this.
- Good, I'm fine with it.
- Yeah, me too.
Wait till you see what I floss with.
That's a keeper.
Thank you, Viktor with a K.
Hey, wouldn't it be great if we could do that every night?
Yes, it would.
But we can't.
I know.
Yeah.
But I'm just saying, if we could it would be great.
But I know we can't.
Oh, crap, I can't be late today.
Howard is doling out assignments and the last one through the door could get stuck in Doc Review.
You got somewhere to go?
Yeah.
Yeah, I got somewhere.
You good?
Yeah, all good.
Daniel Wormald.
I'm Officer Baker, this is Officer Saxton.
Yeah, please, come on in.
Come in, it's over here.
See what they did?
I mean, all gone.
All of them.
- Just...
- What's all gone?
I have...
I had a baseball card collection.
- A major collection, all stolen.
- Sorry to hear that.
Was it common knowledge that you have baseball cards?
No, not really.
So nobody in particular you can think of wanted them?
No, not that I...
No.
- How'd they get in?
- The back door over here.
It was open when I came home for lunch.
I mean, it was locked but they must have jimmied it open or something.
Uh-huh.
What time you figure this happened?
I left for work at 8:15, came home for lunch at 12:30...
- ...and called you immediately.
- Was anything else taken?
- Cash, a fair bit.
- How much cash?
Uh, I don't know.
You know, let's focus on what's important here.
You know, all I really care about are my baseball cards.
I have a Topps Mickey Mantle rookie card that's irreplaceable.
It's a mint, 60-40, 90-10 on the reverse.
I can go on.
All my cards are in top-loaders but if they're taken out and exposed to the elements I mean, or creased, God forbid I mean, you're looking at a 9-point downgrade in a matter of seconds.
I understand the first 48 hours are most important in investigations like this so the more time passes, I mean, the less likely we are of a recovery.
So time is of the essence here, guys.
Well, we're gonna help you out the best we can, Mr. Wormald.
Good.
They really tossed this place.
Are you sure they weren't looking for anything else?
- Like what?
- I don't know.
Just wondering your thoughts.
I assume more baseball cards.
Did you have more than the ones in the case here?
Yes, in back.
Thousands.
But these were the crown jewels over here.
You know, the all-star lineup.
Right.
Hm.
- What?
- Just trying to make sense of it.
What's to make sense of?
I mean, isn't it as simple as the perp was looking for more baseball cards?
Or hopped up on speed or whatever and went nuts with the vandalism?
Yeah.
I mean, that could be, yeah.
Pretty sweet Hummer parked in the driveway.
That yours?
Yeah, that's mine.
It's a lease.
Got a great deal on it.
It's very sweet.
They say Arnold Schwarzenegger's the reason that Hummers exist.
- Don't know how, but that's what they say.
- No kidding?
Huh.
What kind of work do you do, Mr. Wormald?
I work IT for a pharmaceutical company.
Wow, computers.
God, I should've gotten into computers.
- I'd have that same Hummer.
- Right.
Look, guys, I'm glad you like my car but I think we're looking through the wrong end of the telescope here.
- The priority is my baseball cards.
- Of course.
Yes, now, I have a detailed manifest of my entire collection and asterisks next to the high-ticket items.
It's clear which ones they'll try to fence first because they're super, super valuable.
So you're gonna wanna get this list out to pawn shops, collectors.
Question anyone who's done any sort of crime like this in the past.
You know, the usual suspects.
Can I get you the list so you can start investigating?
- Yeah, if you could get us that list...
- Okay, I'll print it out.
Hank Aaron, mint.
God, my signed Derek Jeter.
Willy Mays, O-Pee-Chee.
Gotta breathe.
Just keep breathing, keep breathing.
- Okay.
- I know, right?
- Left the TV...
- Uh-huh.
- ...
left the computer.
- Right.
Huh.
There's something wrong with this picture.
Hey, it's me.
Another perfect day in paradise out here.
I'm in the pool.
Okay, call me.
- Hi, how are you?
- Hey, babe, did you get lunch?
- I did.
- Ha-ha.
- I think I'm burning up back here.
- Oh, really?
- You're just in luck.
Look what I have.
- Oh, hey, great.
- You're all red back here.
- Yeah.
I feel stupid.
I told you not to spend so much time in the sun.
You don't listen.
Yeah, it's me again.
Listen, as I speak, not 25 feet away from me I'm looking at the mark.
Think Thurston Howell III if he shacked up with Ginger.
He's dripping in Gucci.
It's like I'm at the watering hole and I'm watching the fattest, slowest water buffalo expose his neck to me, and I'm the lioness ready to strike.
Come, Kim, join me.
Join the pride.
I said "lioness" because it's the females who do all the hunting.
I just wanted to be species-accurate irrespective of my own sex, it's a National Geographic thing.
Anyway get out here.
Bye.
Santa Fe, New Mexico.
I need the number of a law firm, Davis Main.
Yeah, you can connect me.
There are a few options on the company cars.
We can arrange a test drive whenever you'd like.
Company car, wow.
And there's a service that will deliver it right to you, wherever you want.
And if you find you're not happy with it, it's not a big deal to change it out.
That sounds really, uh...
Yeah.
This is interesting.
Oh, if this isn't to your taste we have a collection of art in-house you can choose from.
Any time you're ready, I can put together some samples for you to review.
I...
I...
I like this.
Good.
Well, any other needs you have, I'm here to help.
Office supplies, dietary needs.
Anything special you want stocked in the fridge?
Maybe a humidifier?
- Gets kind of dry in here.
- Omar, I'm pretty low maintenance.
Sure.
Well, if there's anything you need, I'm right outside the door.
- Great.
If I think of anything.
- Okay.
Hey, do you think...?
I'm just looking at this.
Do we get a choice of desks?
What were you thinking?
Is it possible...?
Can we do a cocobolo?
Cocobolo desk?
Absolutely.
I'll get right on that.
ladies.
Get home safe.
-See you later.
-Good night.
no.
No!
No!
Goddamn it!
No.
Come on.
Hey!
Hey!
Somebody!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
--the problem with it is because they believe he's worth....
--the problem of the National Football....
--the football from a player....
--that took place.
Those were attitudes....
there are plenty of rules in play....
You can go.
Here he is.
right on time.
Good to see you.
Howard.
Clifford Main.
Clifford.
Likewise.
We know all about your work on Sandpiper.
it's a group effort.
the folks at HHM are just knocking it out of the park.
-The case wouldn't exist without you.
-Absolutely.
you'll know why I call him Charlie Hustle.
Brian Archuleta and Erin Brill.
-Nice to meet you both.
-Great to meet you.
I hate to do this but could I borrow Ms. Wexler for a moment?
-If you will excuse us....
-Pardon me.
here's the thing.
does that mean the two of us...?
I mean....
-Does it mean...?
-What?
What?
What the hell is this?
If I take this job today with Davis Main does that mean that you and me...?
Is this-
- Is this gonna happen?
Jimmy.
I....
I....
One thing has absolutely nothing to do with the other.
-Nothing at all?
-No.
why would it?
Great.
Sorry about that.
for your interest in me.
but at this time-
- At this time I'm gonna have to take myself out of the running.
Thanks.
Howard.
Jimmy?
that was quick.
-No charge.
-Help me out here.
Did I dream it... 000 on my desk in cash?
No one on God's green earth knew we had it.
We could've split it fifty-fifty.
000 each tax free.
Your point being?
Why didn't we?
I remember you saying something about doing the right thing.
You wanna know why I didn't take that money?
Is that what you're asking?
that's what I'm asking.
I was hired to do a job... that's as far as it goes.
well I know what stopped me.
And you know what?
It's never stopping me again.
ladies.
you should get out once in a while.
have some fun.
I have a business to run.
the business is running you.
Listen to me.
You'll thank me later.
Cucumber water for customer only.
it's me.
Jesus.
Hello?
Hello?
It's me.
I got a new car.
You like it?
We're not taking that to the meet.
How are we gonna get there?
I'll drive my car.
-Why?
-This business requires restraint.
That is the opposite of restraint.
But I like it.
I'm proud of it.
then you be proud of it on your own time.
I'm not getting in that.
then don't.
you don't really do anything.
I've been paying you the salary of three people to just stand behind me.
he's been coming alone.
why do I need you?
I should just go alone.
I'm throwing-
- I'm throwing away money.
Just tossing it away into the trash.
but I'm advising you do not go to that meet without someone watching your back.
of course you're gonna say that.
you don't wanna be out of this easy-peasy job.
but this is the gravy train and it's leaving the station right now.
So last chance.
All aboard.
last chance.
and then I'm-- your services are no longer needed.
No old guy?
did he break a hip or something?
right?
we-
- We parted ways.
so....
You know how it is.
This is interesting.
yeah.
You like it?
be my guest.
check it out.
-Impressive.
-Thank you.
feel the leather.
it's a H2.
Brand-new off the line.
more height.
325 horsepower.
so you can have a girl in a bikini... and they're both gonna be comfortable.
You're riding around with two girls in your SUV.
yeah.
Yes.
I'm gonna count this quick.
make sure it's right.
we are good.
Same as before.
Still factory sealed.
you're welcome to count them.
I trust you.
thank you.
See you next time.
Hello.
Yes.
sorry.
so.... not a lawyer.
Bye.
So this is what a midlife crisis looks like?
Not midlife crisis.
Clarity.
Midlife clarity.
Clarity?
Clearly explain to me why you walked out on the best job opportunity of your life.
Get in the pool and I'll tell you.
come on.
nothing fancy.
it's 82 degrees.
and you gotta try this crab dip.
-Why are you acting like this?
-I'm not acting like anything.
I just finally decided to be me.
Mr. Cumpston?
Would you like another drink?
I'm good with this.
Mr. Cumpston.
I'll be in the bar.
Not for long.
check.
quit the law"?
simple as that.
Jimmy... buddy?
right?
-The Zafiro Añejo?
-Yeah.
a $50 shot of tequila?
-Is it worth it?
-Apparently.
It's kind of a personal choice thing.
so two.
can't we?
we can't.
We....
I am paying.
And he will be having a shot of your well brand and I'll have a glass of your house red.
a pinot and a syrah.
dealer's choice.
-Something with alcohol.
-You got it.
Jimmy.
Did something happen in Cicero?
Why did something have to happen?
you were ready to take the job.
and you're suddenly quitting the law?
Cheating hotels out of expensive liquor.
Wearing a weird pinkie ring.
are you in the Mafia now?
Asking if we have a future.
where did that come from?
I just....
Cicero has nothing to do with it.
It's my whole life.
Well my life since Chuck made me come to Albuquerque.
all I've done is try to make Chuck happy.
Bend over backwards to please Chuck.
no more.
isn't that exactly what Chuck wants?
okay?
I got into the law for all the wrong reasons.
I'm trusting my instincts.
I think that my talents are better spent elsewhere.
Where?
Floating in somebody else's pool?
you're a great lawyer.
Why give that up?
I'm not saying it didn't have its moments.
convincing people I don't have to be a lawyer to do that.
people tell me how they see me...
-...and it's not as a lawyer.
-All right.
-Here you go.
-Thank you.
okay?
thanks.
Short it.
Short it.
Short it.
Short that shit.
it's got no legs.
It's like a circus freak minus the fun.
That one's even worse.
Who's giving you these?
Do me a favor.
Take a pillow put it over that stock's face until you hear the deathbed queef.
so?
-It's a loser.
then what?
Float around and wait for your Sandpiper money to roll in?
-That could take years.
-Sandpiper has no bearing on this at all.
what's the plan?
so no plan.
Just walk the earth?
Like Jules at the end of Pulp Fiction?
whatever opportunity arises...
-...
I will take it.
-Whatever opportunity?
-Yeah.
-Wasn't Davis Main an opportunity?
and you're walking away from it.
Look shouldn't you at least try the job before you say no?
including my own?
I appreciate your concern but it's not for me.
I don't want it.
do you remember how long you studied for that bar?
-How hard you worked?
-It's like a burn victim.... you're just gonna toss it away?
That's the sunk cost fallacy.
-The what?
-The fallacy of sunk cost.
they throw good money after bad thinking they can turn their luck around.
I've already spent this much money...
I gotta keep going!
there's no reward at the end of this game.
You are making a mistake.
I know you're making a mistake.
I've been doing the "right thing" and where has it gotten me?
I don't....
Yeah.
Not my thing.
Not my thing.
Still not my thing.
-I don't get it.
I just don't get it.
-It's what's right for me.
dude.
Wall Street's for suckers.
Who needs that aggravation?
I don't.
I can make a million-dollar stock trade on my laptop sitting on a toilet.
shitting gold bricks on my throne.
That's why Spiegelman and Deitch want my business.
I'm a golden god.
Of course I remember.
Who forgets that?
That fart had the anger of a repressed minority community.
you're gonna give them pinkeye for life.
bro.
brother-man.
check you.
-Come with me.
trust me.
What are you gonna do?
You wanna understand what I'm talking about?
Follow my lead.
could you settle a bet for us?
-Can I what?
-Sorry... but I kind of was.
We heard you talking about stocks.
so question if you could settle a debate between me and my sister.
-We probably shouldn't bother--
-I wouldn't normally do this.
But we need an expert.
This guy sounds like he knows his stuff.
here's the question:
is there a financial limit to how much a person's allowed to invest?
A limit?
no limit.
even if it's an inheritance?
inheritance taxes and whatnot?
fantastic.
no limit.
too.
Sticking it all in the bank?
No.
just make sure you diversify.
diversify.
That's-
- We gotta-
- Hey... diversify"?
diversify is-
- You know the saying "don't put all your eggs in one basket"?
-Right?
Same principle.
-Makes complete sense.
Thank you.
ballpark I could give you examples of smart diversification.
Yeah.
an uncle on our father's side recently passed and he left us somewhere in the neighborhood of 1.4 million.
but I think if we invest it smart now... triple it... right?
In my opinion?
man.
I can give you a consult.
we'll do it ourselves through an online brokerage site.
I think they're called blue chip stocks.
yeah.
You can totally do it yourself.
Shoot for the tried and true.
Andrea Doria Corky Romano.
Right?
They all seemed rock solid beforehand.
But then.... yeah.
So how do you know?
that's where someone like myself comes in.
Proven track record as a wealth manager.
I take calculated but aggressive risks... and I do.
-I'm practically a money-printing machine.
-That sounds good.
A money-printing machine.
we can talk.
we can just rap about this a little bit.
I guess.
-Yeah?
sis?
Can we just talk?
it's no-- with a K.
Viktor with a K.
And this lovely lady is?
It's Giselle.
-Giselle Saint Claire.
-Lovely.
sit.
I won't bite.
exotic names.
Boer to be precise.
Our father's side of the family is from South Africa which is where Uncle Humphrey passed away.
right?
Charlize Theron.
well.
but hope to go someday.
when I'm done with you...
-...you might take your own private jet.
-Nice.
hi.
We are sitting here now.
We could use a wine list if you get a chance-- are you a tequila fan?
Yes.
You down for that?
You ever try Zafiro Añejo?
but I'm down for whatever.
Three of whatever she just said.
-You got it.
-All right.
a great investment and you're picking the right time to jump in.
Why do you listen to him?
He's an idiot.
He talks about his cars.
He talks about....
-How many cars did he have?
-I don't think....
Ken.
yeah.
Compliments of the bartender.
Thought you might want a souvenir.
we didn't.
cheers.
I think we're ready for the check.
it's a smart way to go.
so to be clear you take the money directly from our account...
-...and invest it--
-Diversify it.
Diversify it.
And then all the dividends and all the profits and the what-have-you comes back into our account.
Absolutely.
You'll get a statement showing how much your money is growing... buddy let's do this.
Great.
you are next.
This is so exciting.
it's been a pleasure.
-I got that.
what?
Ken.
-You are the greatest.
Thank you.
-No problemo.
This will be the best decision you'll make.
We should get out of your hair.
this... that's got all my contact info.
or anything at all.
-Ken.
-Bye.
guys.
-Bye.
-Try and stop us.
Just wow.
Hey.
What--?
it is.
go!
Zafiro Añejo!
Shut up.
He's gonna come out.
I didn't read the fine print.
-Wait!
Yeah!
-Holy crap.
-I can't--
Can I borrow that when you're done?
that's gross.
How is it gross?
Our germs have already intermingled.
it's different.
-Why is it different?
-Because.
and there's cold sores....
All sorts of food and weird--
-Come on.
-What?
No!
I'll do it right now.
-I don't care.
-I need to brush my teeth.
-I don't have an extra.
That's fine.
I got this.
me too.
Wait till you see what I floss with.
That's a keeper.
Viktor with a K.
wouldn't it be great if we could do that every night?
it would.
But we can't.
I know.
Yeah.
if we could it would be great.
But I know we can't.
I can't be late today.
Howard is doling out assignments and the last one through the door could get stuck in Doc Review.
You got somewhere to go?
I got somewhere.
You good?
all good.
this is Officer Saxton.
come on in.
it's over here.
See what they did?
all gone.
All of them.
-Just--
-What's all gone?
I have-
- I had a baseball card collection.
all stolen.
-Sorry to hear that.
Was it common knowledge that you have baseball cards?
not really.
So nobody in particular you can think of wanted them?
not that I-
- No.
-How'd they get in?
-The back door over here.
It was open when I came home for lunch.
it was locked but they must have jimmied it open or something.
What time you figure this happened?
came home for lunch at 12:30...
-...and called you immediately.
-Was anything else taken?
a fair bit.
-How much cash?
let's focus on what's important here.
all I really care about are my baseball cards.
I have a Topps Mickey Mantle rookie card that's irreplaceable.
90-10 on the reverse.
I can go on.
All my cards are in top-loaders but if they're taken out and exposed to the elements...
God forbid... you're looking at a 9-point downgrade in a matter of seconds.
I understand the first 48 hours are most important in investigations like this... the less likely we are of a recovery.
guys.
Mr. Wormald.
Good.
They really tossed this place.
Are you sure they weren't looking for anything else?
-Like what?
-I don't know.
Just wondering your thoughts.
I assume more baseball cards.
Did you have more than the ones in the case here?
in back.
Thousands.
But these were the crown jewels over here.
the all-star lineup.
Right.
-What?
-Just trying to make sense of it.
What's to make sense of?
isn't it as simple as the perp was looking for more baseball cards?
Or hopped up on speed or whatever and went nuts with the vandalism?
yeah.
Pretty sweet Hummer parked in the driveway.
That yours?
that's mine.
It's a lease.
Got a great deal on it.
It's very sweet.
They say Arnold Schwarzenegger's the reason that Hummers exist.
but that's what they say.
-No kidding?
Mr. Wormald?
I work IT for a pharmaceutical company.
computers.
I should've gotten into computers.
-I'd have that same Hummer.
-Right.
I'm glad you like my car but I think we're looking through the wrong end of the telescope here.
-The priority is my baseball cards.
-Of course.
I have a detailed manifest of my entire collection and asterisks next to the high-ticket items.
It's clear which ones they'll try to fence first... super valuable.
collectors.
Question anyone who's done any sort of crime like this in the past.
the usual suspects.
Can I get you the list so you can start investigating?
I'll print it out.
mint.
my signed Derek Jeter.
O-Pee-Chee.
keep breathing.
right?
Left the TV...
-...
left the computer.
-Right.
There's something wrong with this picture.
it's me.
Another perfect day in paradise out here.
I'm in the pool.
call me.
did you get lunch?
I did.
really?
great.
you're all red back here.
-Yeah.
I feel stupid.
I told you not to spend so much time in the sun.
You don't listen.
it's me again.
not 25 feet away from me I'm looking at the mark.
Think Thurston Howell III if he shacked up with Ginger.
He's dripping in Gucci.
It's like I'm at the watering hole... slowest water buffalo... and I'm the lioness ready to strike.
join me.
Join the pride.
I said "lioness" because it's the females who do all the hunting.
I just wanted to be species-accurate... it's a National Geographic thing.
Anyway get out here.
Bye.
New Mexico.
Davis Main.
you can connect me.
There are a few options on the company cars.
We can arrange a test drive whenever you'd like.
wow.
wherever you want.
it's not a big deal to change it out.
That sounds really....
Yeah.
This is interesting.
if this isn't to your taste we have a collection of art in-house you can choose from.
I can put together some samples for you to review.
I-
- I-
- I like this.
I'm here to help.
dietary needs.
Anything special you want stocked in the fridge?
Maybe a humidifier?
I'm pretty low maintenance.
I'm right outside the door.
-Great.
If I think of anything.
-Okay.
do you think...?
I'm just looking at this.
Do we get a choice of desks?
What were you thinking?
Is it possible...?
Can we do a cocobolo?
Cocobolo desk?
Absolutely.
I'll get right on that.
Previously on "Better Call Saul..."
Why were you working against me?
You're not a real lawyer!
Now that I'm doing the job alone, I get the full 1500.
I can get more pills.
If you're gonna be a criminal, do your homework.
Thanks for not heading to the Bahamas with this.
- What are you doing?
- "The right thing."
Whatever it was, did you get it out of your system?
Yep, all gone.
(Kim) The Sandpiper case?
It's getting too big for HHM.
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about there's an office in Santa Fe with your name on it.

KIM:
Ah, here he is.
HOWARD:
Oh, great.
Jimmy, right on time.
Good to see you.
Hello, Howard.
Hey.
Hi.
James McGill, Clifford Main.
Just "Jimmy." And it's a pleasure to meet you, Clifford.
Likewise.
We know all about your work on Sandpiper.
Well, it's a group effort.
I mean, the folks at HHM are just knocking it out of the park.
Well, you know, the case wouldn't exist without you.
Absolutely.
Once you get him on your team, you'll know why I call him "Charlie Hustle."
Jimmy, these are my associates...
Brian Archuleta and Erin Brill.
- Nice to meet you both.
- It's great to meet you.
I hate to do this, but, um, could I borrow Ms. Wexler for a moment?
If you will excuse us?
[Clears throat] Pardon me.
[Chuckles]
What's going on?
I just, um [clears throat]
Listen, here's the thing.
If I take this job, does that mean the two of us...
I mean, uh...
Does it mean, uh...
What?

Nothing at all.
No.
Of course not.

Great. [Sighs]
Uh, sorry about that.
Listen, I just want to say thank you, sincerely,
For your interest in me.
It's an honor to be considered,
But at this time...
At this time...
Um, I'm gonna have to take myself out of the running.
Thanks.
Thank you, Howard.
Uh, Jimmy?
[brakes screech]
Mike:
Well, that was quick.
No charge.
Help me out here.
Did I dream it,
Or did I have $1,600,000 on my desk in cash?
No one on god's green earth knew we had it.
We could've split it 50/50.
We could've gone home with $800,000... each!
Tax-free!
Your point being?
Why didn't we?
I remember you saying something about doing the right thing.
You want to know why I didn't take that money?
Is that what you're asking?
Yeah, that's what I'm asking.
Me, personally, I was hired to do a job.
I did it.
That's as far as it goes.
Yeah.
Well, I know what stopped me.
And you know what?
It's never stopping me again.

Geez.
Hello?
Hello?
It's me.
I got a new car.
You like it?
We're not taking that to the meet.
How are we gonna get there?
I'll drive.
My car.
Why?
This business requires restraint.
That is the opposite of restraint.
But...
I like it.
I mean, I'm proud of it.
Good.
Then you be proud of it on your own time, but not with me.
I'm not getting in that.
Okay.
Then... then don't.
Honestly, uh, you don't really do anything.
I've been paying you the salary of three people to just stand behind me.
You know?
And...
And these...
these last few deals...
This Nacho fella, he's been coming alone.
I mean, if he doesn't need backup men, then, I mean, why do I need you?
I should just go alone.
I'm throwing...
I'm throwing away money.
Just tossing it away.
Into the trash.
Look, you do whatever you want, but I'm advising you...
do not go to that meet without someone watching your back.
Yeah, well, of course you're gonna say that.
I mean, you don't want to be out of this easy-peasy job.
Well, I'm sorry, but this is the gravy train, and it's leaving the station right now.
So last chance.
All aboard.
Seriously, last chance.
I'm gonna count to, say, 10, and then I'm...
All right, then.
Your services are no longer needed!
[Bird cawing]
[Engine shuts off]
Hola.
No old guy?
What, did he break a hip or something?
[Chuckles] I know, right?
Yeah, no, we, uh...
We... we parted ways.
Yeah, saw things differently.
So...
You know how it is.
This is interesting.
Oh, yeah.
You like it?
Can I take a look?
Oh.
Be my guest.
Get in.
[Chuckles] Check it out.
Wow.
Impressive.
Thank you.
Get in.
Feel the leather.
Yeah, it's a H2.
Brand-new off the line.
Slimmer than the H1 but longer, more height.
Yeah, it's a honey.
V-8 engine, 325 horsepower, tri-zone climate controls.
So you can have a girl in a bikini and another in a parka, and they're both gonna be comfortable. [Chuckles]
You're running around with two girls in your S.U.V., you'd be really comfortable, huh?
Oh, yeah.
Yes.
[Chuckles]
I'm gonna count this quick.
Do your thing.
Make sure it's right.
Okeydokey.
We are good.
Uh, same as before.
Uh, still factory-sealed.
And, as always, you're welcome to count them.
I trust you.
Great.
Thank you.
See you next time.

That's right... not a lawyer.
Bye.

[Sighs]
So, this is what a midlife crisis looks like?
Not midlife crisis.
Clarity.
Midlife clarity.
Clarity?
Huh.
Clearly explain to me why you walked out on the best job opportunity of your life.
[Sighs]
Get in the pool, and I'll tell ya.
Get in the pool?
[Chuckling] Yeah.
Come on.
Just pop in the gift shop and buy a bathing suit... get a one-piece, nothing fancy.
The water is perfect.
It's 82 degrees.
You can order a drink.
And you got to try this crab dip.
Why are you acting like this?
I'm not acting like anything.
I just... finally decided to be me.
Everything okay, Mr. Cumpston?
Would you like another drink?
Uh, I'm good with this.
I'll tell you what, Mr. Cumpston.
If you really want to talk, I'll be in the bar.
Not for long.
Hey, Rolando.
Check.
What do...
What do you mean "quit the law"?
- [ "Buena Vista" plays in background]
- I quit it.
Simple as that.
Oh, well, thanks for explaining, Jimmy.
- It's super-clear now.
- Hey, buddy?
Uh, is that a misprint right there?
It's got to be, right?
- The Zafiro Anejo?
- Yeah.
That's correct, actually, believe it or not.
Holy shit.
A $50 shot of tequila?
Is it worth it?
Apparently.
I mean, it's kind of a personal-choice kind of thing.
Well, I can't die without trying a $50 shot of tequila, so, uh... two... dos... neat.
And, uh, we can charge that to the room, can't we?
No, we can't.
We...
I am paying.
And he will be having a shot of your well brand, and I'll have a glass of your house red.
We have a Cabernet, a Pinot, and a Syrah.
Whatever.
Dealer's choice.
Something with alcohol.
You got it.
[Sighs]
Jimmy... did something happen in Cicero?
Why did something have to happen in Cicero?
Because when I talked to you about Davis Main, you were ready to take the job.
Now you're back, and you're suddenly quitting the law, cheating hotels out of expensive liquor, wearing a weird pinkie ring?
What, are you in the Mafia now?
Asking if we have a future.
I mean, where did that come from?
I don't know.
I just...
Well, Cicero has nothing to do with it.
It's my whole life.
Well, my life since Chuck made me come to Albuquerque.
Ever since I got here, all I've done is try to make Chuck happy, bend over backwards to please Chuck.
Chuck, Chuck, Chuck.
Well, no more.
You quitting the law... isn't that exactly what Chuck wants?
Who cares?
This is for me, okay?
I-I got into the law for all the wrong reasons.
I'm trusting my instincts.
I think that my talents are better spent elsewhere.
Where?
Floating in somebody else's pool?
- [Scoffs] - [Sighs]
Jimmy, you're a great lawyer.
Why give that up?
I'm not saying it didn't have its moments, but the stuff I liked about it...
selling people, convincing people...
I don't have to be a lawyer to do that.
Besides, people tell me how they see me, and it's not as a lawyer.
All right.
Here you go.
Thank you.
Lemme know if I can get you guys anything else, okay?
KEN:
Bobby, what up, brother man?
Oh, thanks.
Short it.
Short it.
Short it.
Short that shit.
That stock is useless.
It's got no legs.
It's like a circus freak minus the fun.
And that one's even worse.
Who's giving you these?
Please do me a favor.
Take a pillow, put it over that stock's face until you hear the deathbed queef.
- KEN:
It's a loser.
- Okay, so... if you're not gonna be a lawyer, then what?
Float around and wait for your Sandpiper money to roll in?
No.
That could take years.
Sandpiper has no bearing on this at all.
Yeah, it's got legs.
Okay, then, what's the plan?
To be open to the universe.
Okay, so no plan.
Just walk the Earth, like Jules at the end of "Pulp Fiction"?
Look, whatever the universe presents, whatever opportunity arises, I will take it.
- Whatever opportunity?
- Yeah.
Wasn't Davis Main an opportunity?
It's a great opportunity, and you're walking away from it.
Not him, not the guy who...
Look, shouldn't you at least try the job before you say no?
And waste everyone's time, including my own?
Kim, I appreciate your concern, but it's not for me.
I don't want it.
Jimmy, do you remember how long you studied for that bar?
How hard you worked?
All that effort, you're just gonna toss it away?
That's the Sunk Cost Fallacy.
W...
The what?
The Fallacy of Sunk Cost...
It's what gamblers do.
They throw good money after bad thinking they can turn their luck around.
It's like, "I've already spent this much money or time... whatever.
I got to keep going!"
No, there's no reward at the end of this game.
You are making a mistake.
I know you're making a mistake.
I've been doing the "right" thing for all these years now, and where has it gotten me?
Nowhere.
I'm sorry.
I don't...
[Sighs]
[ "Transatlantic" plays in background]
It's not my thing.
I don't get it.
- I just don't get it.
- It's what's right for me.
[Laughs]
Donkey balls.
Pure donkey balls, dude.
Wall Street's for suckers.
Who needs that aggravation?
If the the Oracle doesn't have to live there, then I sure as hell don't.
I can make a million-dollar stock trade on my laptop sitting on a toilet.
Like Midas, shitting gold bricks on my throne.
That's why Speigelman and Deitch want my business so bad.
I'm a golden God.
Look, of course I remember that.
Who forgets a thing like that?
That fart had the anger of a repressed minority community.
You fart like that in someone's face, you're gonna give them pinkeye for life.
[Laughs]
Good convo, bro.
Till next time, brutha-man.
- Flip side.
On it.
- Come with me.
- What?
- Just come on.
Trust me.
What are you gonna do?
You want to understand what I'm talking about?
Follow my lead.
[Indistinct conversations]
Hey, buddy, could you settle a bet for us?
- I what?
- Uh, sorry.
I don't want to make it sound like I was eavesdropping, but I kind of was.
Uh, we heard you talking about stocks.
Uh-huh.
Yeah, so, question... if you could settle a debate between me and my sister.
Uh, you know what?
We probably shouldn't be bothering this...
We wouldn't normally do this...
Right?
But we need an expert.
This guy sounds like he knows his stuff.
Yeah, go.
Okay.
Here's the question.
Uh, when it comes to the stock market, is there, like, a financial limit to how much a person's allowed to invest?
A limit?
No.
No limit.
Knew it.
Oh, even if it's an inheritance?
You know, with, like, inheritance taxes and whatnot?
Nope.
Same.
That's...
Oh, fantastic.
Thank you, buddy.
See?
No limit.
Told you we could invest it all.
And it's a smart move, too.
Sticking it all in the bank?
No.
Um, yeah.
You can... invest all your money.
Just make sure you diversify.
Yeah.
Diversify.
[Clicks tongue] That's...
You got to...
Oh, hey, um...
What do you mean, "diversify"?
Well, diversify is...
Y-You know that saying,
"Don't put all your eggs in one basket," right?
Same principle.
No, it makes complete sense.
Thank you.
Now, if I had an idea of the money we're talking about...
Ballpark...
I could give you examples of smart diversification.
[Sighs] Yeah, um...
Look, an uncle on our father's side recently passed, and he left us somewhere in the neighborhood of $1.4 million.
And I don't mean to be greedy, but I think, if we invest it smart now, we could double it, triple it... we could quadruple the whole inheritance, right?
In my opinion?
Fortune favors the bold, man.
Now, if you guys are free to join me for a drink,
I can give you a quick consult.
That's all right.
We were gonna do it ourselves through one of those online brokerage websites.
We're just gonna pick, uh, a classic, like...
I think they're called blue-chip stocks?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you can totally do it yourself.
Shoot for the tried and true.
'Course, you might be putting your cash in the Hindenburg, the Andrea Doria, uh..."Corky Romano."
- [Chuckles]
- Right?
They all seemed rock-solid beforehand, but then...
Yeah, not good.
Not good, yeah.
So, how do you know?
Well, that's where someone like myself comes in.
Proven track record as a wealth manager.
I take calculated but aggressive risks 'cause I want to catch lightning.
And I do.
Practically a money-printing machine.
[Chuckling] That sounds good.
A money-printing machine.
Listen, there's a little booth over here.
There's some privacy.
We can talk.
No obligations.
We can just... just rap about this a little bit.
- Yeah, I guess.
- Yeah?
What do you say, sis?
Can we just talk?
Electric slide on in there.
And we'll just rap a little bit.
It's no...
My name's Ken, by the way.
Uh, Viktor, with a "K."
Cool.
Viktor with a "K."
And this lovely lady is?
It's...
Giselle.
Giselle Saint Claire.
Ah, lovely.
Please, sit.
I won't bite.
So, Viktor with a "K" and Giselle... exotic names.
JIMMY:
They're Dutch.
Well, Boer, to be precise.
Our... father's side of the family is from South Africa, which is where uncle Humphrey passed away.
South Africa.
They grow them beautiful down there, right?
Charlize Theron.
And you.
Oh.
Well...
I've never actually been, but hope to go someday.
Tell you what, by the time I'm done with you two, you might be taking your own private jet.
Nice.
Excuse me.
Hi.
Uh, we are sitting here now, so, uh, we could use a wine list, if you get a chance...
Hey, uh, are a tequila fan?
Yes.
You down for that?
You ever try Zafiro Anejo?
No, I have not, but I'm down for whatever.
Three of whatever she just said.
- You got it.
- All right.
So, stock market.
A great investment.
And you're picking the right time to jump in.
- [ "Goldigger" plays in background]
- Why do you listen to me?
I'm an idiot.
[Laughs]
And talks about his cars, talks about...
[Jimmy and Ken laugh]
- How many cars did he have?
- I don't think...
[Laughter]
- It doesn't make sense.
- That's it, Ken.
Oh, yeah.
Compliments of the bartender.
She thought you might want a souvenir.
Oh, my God.
Did we drink the entire bottle?
Not yet, we didn't.
- Boom.
- Hey, hey, cheers.
Uh, I think we're ready for the check.
[Laughter]
[Groans]
No, really, it's the smart way to go.
KIM:
Okay.
But, so, to be clear, you take the money directly from our account and invest it.
- Diversify.
- Diversify it.
And then all the dividends and all the profits and the...what-have-you comes back into our account.
Boom.
Absolutely.
And you'll get a detailed statement showing you how much your money is growing... biggest bulls of the month, et cetera.
Ken, buddy...
let's do this.
Great.
Right there, Viktor with a "K,"
and, Giselle, you are next.
- This is so exciting.
- Mm-hmm.
Folks, it's been a pleasure.
- Oops, I got that.
- Can't let you do it, son.
Wait.
What?
Ken, you are the greatest.
Thank you.
- No problem-o.
Hey, this will be the best decision you'll ever make.
Oh, I believe it.
All right, well, we should get out of your hair.
- Yeah.
- Oh, wait, wait.
This... is for you.
Now, that's got all my contact info.
Call me anytime with questions or anything at all.
Ken.
Bye.
Call me, guys.
- Bye.
- Try and stop us.
[Laughs]
Wow.
[Chuckles]
Just wow.
[Inhales deeply]
[Chuckles]
[Exhales slowly]
Hey.
What I...
Is this right?
Yes, sir, it is.
- ["Music Wine" plays in background]
- KIM:
Go, go, go, go, go!
[Both laugh]
- Zafiro Anejo!
- Shh!
He's gonna come out. [Laughs]
Oh, no.
I didn't read the fine print.
- Wait.
- Yeah!
[Both laugh]
Holy crap.
I can't b...
[Laughing]
[Breathes deeply]
[Chuckles]
[Chuckles]
[Laughter, indistinct conversations]
[Water turns on]
Can I borrow that when you're done?
[Chuckles] No, that's gross.
H-how is it gross?
Our germs have already intermingled.
It's my toothbrush.
It's different.
Why is it different?
Because.
You know, gums bleed, and there's... there's cold sores, all sorts of food and weir...
Let me see that.
Come on.
What?
No!
Come on!
I'll do it right now.
- I don't care.
- I need to brush my teeth.
I don't have an extra.
It's not my problem.
That's fine.
I got this.
Good.
I'm fine with this.
Yeah, me too.
Wait till you see what I floss with.
[Laughing]
[Jewelry clattering]
That's a keeper.
[Chuckles] Thank you, Viktor with a "K."
Hey, wouldn't it be great if we could do that every night?
Yes, it would.
But...
We can't.
I know, yeah.
But I'm just saying, if we could, it would be great.
But I know we can't.
Oh, crap.
I can't be late today.
Howard is doling out assignments, and the last one through the door could get stuck in doc review.
You got somewhere to go?
Yeah.
Uh, yeah, I got somewhere.
You good?
[Sighs] Yeah.
All good.
[Door closes]
[Dog barks in distance]

[Knock on door]
Daniel Wormald?
I'm Officer Baker.
This is Officer Saxton.
Yeah, please.
Come on in.
Come in.
It's over here.
See what they did?
I mean, all gone.
All of them, just...
Uh, what's all gone?
I have...
I had a baseball-card collection... a major collection...
All stolen.
Oh, sorry to hear that.
Uh, was it common knowledge that you have baseball cards?
No, not really.
So, nobody in particular you can think of wanting them?
No.
Not that I...
No.
How'd they get in?
Uh, the back door over here.
It was open when I came home for lunch.
I mean, it was locked, but they must have jimmied it open or something.
Uh-huh.
At what time, uh, you figure this happened?
I left for work at 8:15, came home for lunch at 12:30, and called you immediately.
Was anything else taken?
Cash... a fair bit.
Uh, um...
How much cash?
Uh, I don't know.
You know, let's focus on what's important here, you know?
All I really care about are my baseball cards.
You know, I have a Topps Mickey Mantle rookie card that's irreplaceable.
It's a mint, 60/40, 90/10 on the reverse.
I can go on.
All my cards are in top-loaders, but if they're taken out and exposed to the elements,
I mean, or creased, God forbid,
I mean, you're looking at a 9-point downgrade in a matter of seconds.
I understand the first 48 hours are the most important in investigations like this, so the more time passes,
I mean, the less likely we are of a recovery.
So...time is of the essence here, guys.
Well, we're gonna help you out the best we can, Mr. Wormald.
Good.
Well...they really tossed this place.
-[Scoffs]
- I mean, are you sure they weren't looking for anything else?
Like what?
I don't know.
J-Just wondering your thoughts.
I assume more baseball cards.
Did you have more baseball cards than the ones you keep locked in that case here?
Yes, in... in back... thousands.
But these were the crown jewels over here.
You know, t-the all-star lineup.
Right.
Hmm.
What?
Just trying to make sense of it.
What's to make sense of?
I mean, isn't it as simple as the perp was looking for more baseball cards?
Or hopped up on speed or whatever and went nuts with the vandalism?
Yeah.
I mean, that could be.
Yeah.
Pretty sweet Hummer parked in the driveway.
That yours?
Yeah, that's mine.
Uh, it's a lease.
Got a great deal on it.
It's very sweet.
You know, they say Arnold Schwarzenegger is the reason that Hummers exist.
I don't know how, but that's what they say.
- No kidding.
- Yeah.
Huh.
What kind of work do you do, Mr. Wormald?
Uh, I work I.T., uh, for a pharmaceutical company.
Wow.
Computers.
God, I should've gotten into computers.
- I'd have that same Hummer.
- [Chuckles] Yeah, right.
Look, guys, I'm glad you like my car, but I think we're looking through the wrong end of the telescope here.
You know, the priority is my baseball cards.
Of course.
Yes, now, I have a detailed manifest of my entire collection and asterisks next to the high-ticket items, so it's clear which ones they're gonna try to fence first, 'cause they're super, super valuable.
So you're gonna want to get this list out to pawnshops, uh, collectors, question anyone who's done any sort of crime like this in the past.
You know, the... the usual suspects.
Uh, can I get you the list so you can start investigating?
Yeah, you...
Yeah, if you could get us that list...
Okay, I'll...
I'll print it out.
Hank Aaron, mint.
God, my signed Derek Jeter.
Willie Mays, O-Pee-Chee.
Got to breathe.
Just keep breathing.
Keep breathing.
- Okay.
- I know, right?
Left the TV.
- Uh-huh.
- Left the computer.
- Right.
Huh.
There's something wrong with this picture.

- Hey, babe.
Did you get lunch?
WOMAN:
I did.
MAN:
You know, I think I'm burning up back here.
Oh, really?
Well, you're just in luck.
- Look what I have.
- Oh, hey, great.
Oh, yeah, you're all red back here.
Yeah.
That feels good, babe.
- [Dialing]
- I told you not to spend so much time in the sun.
You don't listen.
Yeah, it's me again.
Listen, as I speak, not 25 feet away from me,
I'm looking at the mark.
Think Thurston Howell III if he shacked up with Ginger.
[Chuckles] He's dripping in Gucci.
It's like I'm at the watering hole, and I'm watching the fattest, slowest water buffalo expose his neck to me, and I'm the lioness ready to strike.
[Chuckles] Come, Kim.
Join me.
Join the pride.
Um, I said "lioness"
because it's the females who do all the hunting.
Uh, just wanted to be species-accurate, irrespective of my own sex.
It's a National Geographic thing.
Anyway...
Get out here.
Bye.

There are a few options on the company cars.
We can arrange a test-drive whenever you'd like.
Company car... wow.
And there's a service that will deliver it right to you, wherever you want.
And if you find you're not happy with it, it's not a big deal to change it out.
That sounds really, uh...
[Sighs] Yeah.
This is, uh, interesting.
Oh, if, uh... [Chuckles]
If this isn't to your taste, we have a collection of art in-house you can, uh, choose from.
Anytime you're ready,
I can put together some samples for you to review.
I...
I...
No, I like this.
Good.
Uh, well, any other needs you have, I'm here to help.
Office supplies, dietary needs...
Anything special you want stocked in the fridge?
Uh, maybe a humidifier?
Gets kind of dry in here.
Omar, I...
I'm pretty low-maintenance.
Sure.
Well, if there's anything you need,
I'm right outside the door.
Great.
If I think of anything.
Good.
Hey, do you think, um...
I'm just looking at this.
D-Do we get a choice of desks?
What were you thinking?
Um... is it possible, um...
Can we do... cocobolo?
Cocobolo desk?
Absolutely.
I'll get right on that.

Previously on "Better Call Saul..."
Why were you working against me?
You're not a real lawyer!
Now that I'm doing the job alone, I get the full 1500.
I can get more pills.
If you're gonna be a criminal, do your homework.
Thanks for not heading to the Bahamas with this.
- What are you doing?
- "The right thing."
Whatever it was, did you get it out of your system?
Yep, all gone.
(Kim) The Sandpiper case?
It's getting too big for HHM.
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about there's an office in Santa Fe with your name on it.

Ah, here he is.
HOWARD:
Oh, great.
Jimmy, right on time.
Good to see you.
Hello, Howard.
Hey.
Hi.
James McGill, Clifford Main.
Just "Jimmy." And it's a pleasure to meet you, Clifford.
Likewise.
We know all about your work on Sandpiper.
Well, it's a group effort.
I mean, the folks at HHM are just knocking it out of the park.
Well, you know, the case wouldn't exist without you.
Absolutely.
Once you get him on your team, you'll know why I call him "Charlie Hustle."
Jimmy, these are my associates...
Brian Archuleta and Erin Brill.
- Nice to meet you both.
- It's great to meet you.
I hate to do this, but, um, could I borrow Ms. Wexler for a moment?
If you will excuse us?
[Clears throat] Pardon me.
[Chuckles]
What's going on?
I just, um [clears throat]
Listen, here's the thing.
If I take this job, does that mean the two of us...
I mean, uh...
Does it mean, uh...
What?
What...
What the hell is this?
If I take this job today, with Davis and Main [clears throat] does that mean that you and me...
Is this...
Is this gonna happen?
Jimmy, I...
I...
[Sighs]
One thing has absolutely nothing to do with the other.
Nothing at all.
No.
Of course not.
Why would it?
Great. [Sighs]
Uh, sorry about that.
Listen, I just want to say thank you, sincerely,
For your interest in me.
It's an honor to be considered,
But at this time...
At this time...
Um, I'm gonna have to take myself out of the running.
Thanks.
Thank you, Howard.
Uh, Jimmy?

Mike:
Well, that was quick.
No charge.
Help me out here.
Did I dream it,
Or did I have $1,600,000 on my desk in cash?
No one on god's green earth knew we had it.
We could've split it 50/50.
We could've gone home with $800,000... each!
Tax-free!
Your point being?
Why didn't we?
I remember you saying something about doing the right thing.
You want to know why I didn't take that money?
Is that what you're asking?
Yeah, that's what I'm asking.
Me, personally, I was hired to do a job.
I did it.
That's as far as it goes.
Yeah.
Well, I know what stopped me.
And you know what?
It's never stopping me again.

Then you be proud of it on your own time, but not with me.
I'm not getting in that.
Okay.
Then... then don't.
Honestly, uh, you don't really do anything.
I've been paying you the salary of three people to just stand behind me.
You know?
And...
And these...
these last few deals...
This Nacho fella, he's been coming alone.
I mean, if he doesn't need backup men, then, I mean, why do I need you?
I should just go alone.
I'm throwing...
I'm throwing away money.
Just tossing it away.
Into the trash.
Look, you do whatever you want, but I'm advising you...
do not go to that meet without someone watching your back.
Yeah, well, of course you're gonna say that.
I mean, you don't want to be out of this easy-peasy job.
Well, I'm sorry, but this is the gravy train, and it's leaving the station right now.
So last chance.
All aboard.
Seriously, last chance.
I'm gonna count to, say, 10, and then I'm...
All right, then.
Your services are no longer needed!
[Bird cawing]
[Engine shuts off]
Hola.
No old guy?
What, did he break a hip or something?
[Chuckles] I know, right?
Yeah, no, we, uh...
We... we parted ways.
Yeah, saw things differently.
So...
You know how it is.
This is interesting.
Oh, yeah.
You like it?
Can I take a look?
Oh.
Be my guest.
Get in.
[Chuckles] Check it out.
Wow.
Impressive.
Thank you.
Get in.
Feel the leather.
Yeah, it's a H2.
Brand-new off the line.
Slimmer than the H1 but longer, more height.
Yeah, it's a honey.
V-8 engine, 325 horsepower, tri-zone climate controls.
So you can have a girl in a bikini and another in a parka, and they're both gonna be comfortable. [Chuckles]
You're running around with two girls in your S.U.V., you'd be really comfortable, huh?
Oh, yeah.
Yes.
[Chuckles]
I'm gonna count this quick.
Do your thing.
Make sure it's right.
Okeydokey.
We are good.
Uh, same as before.
Uh, still factory-sealed.
And, as always, you're welcome to count them.
I trust you.
Great.
Thank you.
See you next time.
[Door closes]
[Cellphone ringing]
[Cellphone beeps]
Hello?
Yes.
Uh, no.
Sorry.
But...
Yes, this is James McGill, but I'm no longer a lawyer, so...
That's right... not a lawyer.
Bye.
[Cellphone beeps]
[Sighs]
So, this is what a midlife crisis looks like?
Not midlife crisis.
Clarity.
Midlife clarity.
Clarity?
Huh.
Clearly explain to me why you walked out on the best job opportunity of your life.
[Sighs]
Get in the pool, and I'll tell ya.
Get in the pool?
[Chuckling] Yeah.
Come on.
Just pop in the gift shop and buy a bathing suit... get a one-piece, nothing fancy.
The water is perfect.
It's 82 degrees.
You can order a drink.
And you got to try this crab dip.
Why are you acting like this?
I'm not acting like anything.
I just... finally decided to be me.
Everything okay, Mr. Cumpston?
Would you like another drink?
Uh, I'm good with this.
I'll tell you what, Mr. Cumpston.
If you really want to talk, I'll be in the bar.
Not for long.
Hey, Rolando.
Check.
What do...
What do you mean "quit the law"?
- [ "Buena Vista" plays in background]
- I quit it.
Simple as that.
Oh, well, thanks for explaining, Jimmy.
- It's super-clear now.
- Hey, buddy?
Uh, is that a misprint right there?
It's got to be, right?
- The Zafiro Anejo?
- Yeah.
That's correct, actually, believe it or not.
Holy shit.
A $50 shot of tequila?
Is it worth it?
Apparently.
I mean, it's kind of a personal-choice kind of thing.
Well, I can't die without trying a $50 shot of tequila, so, uh... two... dos... neat.
And, uh, we can charge that to the room, can't we?
No, we can't.
We...
I am paying.
And he will be having a shot of your well brand, and I'll have a glass of your house red.
We have a Cabernet, a Pinot, and a Syrah.
Whatever.
Dealer's choice.
Something with alcohol.
You got it.
[Sighs]
Jimmy... did something happen in Cicero?
Why did something have to happen in Cicero?
Because when I talked to you about Davis Main, you were ready to take the job.
Now you're back, and you're suddenly quitting the law, cheating hotels out of expensive liquor, wearing a weird pinkie ring?
What, are you in the Mafia now?
Asking if we have a future.
I mean, where did that come from?
I don't know.
I just...
Well, Cicero has nothing to do with it.
It's my whole life.
Well, my life since Chuck made me come to Albuquerque.
Ever since I got here, all I've done is try to make Chuck happy, bend over backwards to please Chuck.
Chuck, Chuck, Chuck.
Well, no more.
You quitting the law... isn't that exactly what Chuck wants?
Who cares?
This is for me, okay?
I-I got into the law for all the wrong reasons.
I'm trusting my instincts.
I think that my talents are better spent elsewhere.
Where?
Floating in somebody else's pool?
- [Scoffs] - [Sighs]
Jimmy, you're a great lawyer.
Why give that up?
I'm not saying it didn't have its moments, but the stuff I liked about it...
selling people, convincing people...
I don't have to be a lawyer to do that.
Besides, people tell me how they see me, and it's not as a lawyer.
All right.
Here you go.
Thank you.
Lemme know if I can get you guys anything else, okay?
KEN:
Bobby, what up, brother man?
Oh, thanks.
Short it.
Short it.
Short it.
Short that shit.
That stock is useless.
It's got no legs.
It's like a circus freak minus the fun.
And that one's even worse.
Who's giving you these?
Please do me a favor.
Take a pillow, put it over that stock's face until you hear the deathbed queef.
- KEN:
It's a loser.
- Okay, so... if you're not gonna be a lawyer, then what?
Float around and wait for your Sandpiper money to roll in?
No.
That could take years.
Sandpiper has no bearing on this at all.
Yeah, it's got legs.
Okay, then, what's the plan?
To be open to the universe.
Okay, so no plan.
Just walk the Earth, like Jules at the end of "Pulp Fiction"?
Look, whatever the universe presents, whatever opportunity arises, I will take it.
- Whatever opportunity?
- Yeah.
Wasn't Davis Main an opportunity?
It's a great opportunity, and you're walking away from it.
Not him, not the guy who...
Look, shouldn't you at least try the job before you say no?
And waste everyone's time, including my own?
Kim, I appreciate your concern, but it's not for me.
I don't want it.
Jimmy, do you remember how long you studied for that bar?
How hard you worked?
All that effort, you're just gonna toss it away?
That's the Sunk Cost Fallacy.
W...
The what?
The Fallacy of Sunk Cost...
It's what gamblers do.
They throw good money after bad thinking they can turn their luck around.
It's like, "I've already spent this much money or time... whatever.
I got to keep going!"
No, there's no reward at the end of this game.
You are making a mistake.
I know you're making a mistake.
I've been doing the "right" thing for all these years now, and where has it gotten me?
Nowhere.
I'm sorry.
I don't...
[Sighs]
[ "Transatlantic" plays in background]
It's not my thing.
I don't get it.
- I just don't get it.
- It's what's right for me.
[Laughs]
Donkey balls.
Pure donkey balls, dude.
Wall Street's for suckers.
Who needs that aggravation?
If the the Oracle doesn't have to live there, then I sure as hell don't.
I can make a million-dollar stock trade on my laptop sitting on a toilet.
Like Midas, shitting gold bricks on my throne.
That's why Speigelman and Deitch want my business so bad.
I'm a golden God.
Look, of course I remember that.
Who forgets a thing like that?
That fart had the anger of a repressed minority community.
You fart like that in someone's face, you're gonna give them pinkeye for life.
[Laughs]
Good convo, bro.
Till next time, brutha-man.
- Flip side.
On it.
- Come with me.
- What?
- Just come on.
Trust me.
What are you gonna do?
You want to understand what I'm talking about?
Follow my lead.
[Indistinct conversations]
Hey, buddy, could you settle a bet for us?
- I what?
- Uh, sorry.
I don't want to make it sound like I was eavesdropping, but I kind of was.
Uh, we heard you talking about stocks.
Uh-huh.
Yeah, so, question... if you could settle a debate between me and my sister.
Uh, you know what?
We probably shouldn't be bothering this...
We wouldn't normally do this...
Right?
but we need an expert.
This guy sounds like he knows his stuff.
Yeah, go.
Okay.
Here's the question.
Uh, when it comes to the stock market, is there, like, a financial limit to how much a person's allowed to invest?
A limit?
No.
No limit.
Knew it.
Oh, even if it's an inheritance?
You know, with, like, inheritance taxes and whatnot?
Nope.
Same.
That's...
Oh, fantastic.
Thank you, buddy.
See?
No limit.
Told you we could invest it all.
And it's a smart move, too.
Sticking it all in the bank?
No.
Um, yeah.
You can... invest all your money.
Just make sure you diversify.
Yeah.
Diversify.
[Clicks tongue] That's...
You got to...
Oh, hey, um...
What do you mean, "diversify"?
Well, diversify is...
Y-You know that saying,
"Don't put all your eggs in one basket," right?
Same principle.
No, it makes complete sense.
Thank you.
Now, if I had an idea of the money we're talking about...
Ballpark...
I could give you examples of smart diversification.
[Sighs] Yeah, um...
Look, an uncle on our father's side recently passed, and he left us somewhere in the neighborhood of $1.4 million.
And I don't mean to be greedy, but I think, if we invest it smart now, we could double it, triple it... we could quadruple the whole inheritance, right?
In my opinion?
Fortune favors the bold, man.
Now, if you guys are free to join me for a drink,
I can give you a quick consult.
That's all right.
We were gonna do it ourselves through one of those online brokerage websites.
We're just gonna pick, uh, a classic, like...
I think they're called blue-chip stocks?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you can totally do it yourself.
Shoot for the tried and true.
'Course, you might be putting your cash in the Hindenburg, the Andrea Doria, uh..."Corky Romano."
- [Chuckles]
- Right?
They all seemed rock-solid beforehand, but then...
Yeah, not good.
Not good, yeah.
So, how do you know?
Well, that's where someone like myself comes in.
Proven track record as a wealth manager.
I take calculated but aggressive risks 'cause I want to catch lightning.
And I do.
Practically a money-printing machine.
[Chuckling] That sounds good.
A money-printing machine.
Listen, there's a little booth over here.
There's some privacy.
We can talk.
No obligations.
We can just... just rap about this a little bit.
- Yeah, I guess.
- Yeah?
What do you say, sis?
Can we just talk?
Electric slide on in there.
And we'll just rap a little bit.
It's no...
My name's Ken, by the way.
Uh, Viktor, with a "K."
Cool.
Viktor with a "K."
And this lovely lady is?
It's...
Giselle.
Giselle Saint Claire.
Ah, lovely.
Please, sit.
I won't bite.
So, Viktor with a "K" and Giselle... exotic names.
JIMMY:
They're Dutch.
Well, Boer, to be precise.
Our... father's side of the family is from South Africa, which is where uncle Humphrey passed away.
South Africa.
They grow them beautiful down there, right?
Charlize Theron.
And you.
Oh.
Well...
I've never actually been, but hope to go someday.
Tell you what, by the time I'm done with you two, you might be taking your own private jet.
Nice.
Excuse me.
Hi.
Uh, we are sitting here now, so, uh, we could use a wine list, if you get a chance...
Hey, uh, are a tequila fan?
Yes.
You down for that?
You ever try Zafiro Anejo?
No, I have not, but I'm down for whatever.
Three of whatever she just said.
- You got it.
- All right.
So, stock market.
A great investment.
And you're picking the right time to jump in.
- [ "Goldigger" plays in background]
- Why do you listen to me?
I'm an idiot.
[Laughs]
And talks about his cars, talks about...
[Jimmy and Ken laugh]
- How many cars did he have?
- I don't think...
[Laughter]
- It doesn't make sense.
- That's it, Ken.
Oh, yeah.
Compliments of the bartender.
She thought you might want a souvenir.
Oh, my God.
Did we drink the entire bottle?
Not yet, we didn't.
- Boom.
- Hey, hey, cheers.
Uh, I think we're ready for the check.
[Laughter]
[Groans]
No, really, it's the smart way to go.
KIM:
Okay.
But, so, to be clear, you take the money directly from our account and invest it.
- Diversify.
- Diversify it.
And then all the dividends and all the profits and the...what-have-you comes back into our account.
Boom.
Absolutely.
And you'll get a detailed statement showing you how much your money is growing... biggest bulls of the month, et cetera.
Ken, buddy...
let's do this.
Great.
Right there, Viktor with a "K,"
and, Giselle, you are next.
- This is so exciting.
- Mm-hmm.
Folks, it's been a pleasure.
- Oops, I got that.
- Can't let you do it, son.
Wait.
What?
Ken, you are the greatest.
Thank you.
-No problem-o.
Hey, this will be the best decision you'll ever make.
Oh, I believe it.
All right, well, we should get out of your hair.
- Yeah.
- Oh, wait, wait.
This... is for you.
Now, that's got all my contact info.
Call me anytime with questions or anything at all.
Ken.
Bye.
Call me, guys.
- Bye.
- Try and stop us.
[Laughs]
Wow.
[Chuckles]
Just wow.
[Inhales deeply]
[Chuckles]
[Exhales slowly]
Hey.
What I...
Is this right?
Yes, sir, it is.
- ["Music Wine" plays in background]
- KIM:
Go, go, go, go, go!
[Both laugh]
- Zafiro Anejo!
- Shh!
He's gonna come out. [Laughs]
Oh, no.
I didn't read the fine print.
- Wait.
- Yeah!
[Both laugh]
Holy crap.
I can't b...
[Laughing]
[Breathes deeply]
[Chuckles]
[Chuckles]
[Laughter, indistinct conversations]
[Water turns on]
Can I borrow that when you're done?
[Chuckles] No, that's gross.
H-how is it gross?
Our germs have already intermingled.
It's my toothbrush.
It's different.
Why is it different?
Because.
You know, gums bleed, and there's... there's cold sores, all sorts of food and weir...
Let me see that.
Come on.
What?
No!
Come on!
I'll do it right now.
- I don't care.
- I need to brush my teeth.
I don't have an extra.
It's not my problem.
That's fine.
I got this.
Good.
I'm fine with this.
Yeah, me too.
Wait till you see what I floss with.
[Laughing]
[Jewelry clattering]
That's a keeper.
[Chuckles] Thank you, Viktor with a "K."
Hey, wouldn't it be great if we could do that every night?
Yes, it would.
But...
We can't.
I know, yeah.
But I'm just saying, if we could, it would be great.
But I know we can't.
Oh, crap.
I can't be late today.
Howard is doling out assignments, and the last one through the door could get stuck in doc review.

Yeah.

This is Officer Saxton.
Yeah, please.
Come on in.
Come in.
It's over here.
See what they did?
I mean, all gone.
All of them, just...
Uh, what's all gone?
I have...
I had a baseball-card collection... a major collection...
All stolen.
Oh, sorry to hear that.
Uh, was it common knowledge that you have baseball cards?
No, not really.
So, nobody in particular you can think of wanting them?
No.
Not that I...
No.
How'd they get in?
Uh, the back door over here.
It was open when I came home for lunch.
I mean, it was locked, but they must have jimmied it open or something.
Uh-huh.
At what time, uh, you figure this happened?
I left for work at 8:15, came home for lunch at 12:30, and called you immediately.
Was anything else taken?
Cash... a fair bit.
Uh, um...
How much cash?
Uh, I don't know.
You know, let's focus on what's important here, you know?
All I really care about are my baseball cards.
You know, I have a Topps Mickey Mantle rookie card that's irreplaceable.
It's a mint, 60/40, 90/10 on the reverse.
I can go on.
All my cards are in top-loaders, but if they're taken out and exposed to the elements,
I mean, or creased, God forbid,
I mean, you're looking at a 9-point downgrade in a matter of seconds.
I understand the first 48 hours are the most important in investigations like this, so the more time passes,
I mean, the less likely we are of a recovery.
So...time is of the essence here, guys.
Well, we're gonna help you out the best we can, Mr. Wormald.
Good.
Well...they really tossed this place.
-[Scoffs]
-I mean, are you sure they weren't looking for anything else?
Like what?
I don't know.
J-Just wondering your thoughts.
I assume more baseball cards.
Did you have more baseball cards than the ones you keep locked in that case here?
Yes, in... in back... thousands.
But these were the crown jewels over here.
You know, t-the all-star lineup.
Right.
Hmm.
What?
Just trying to make sense of it.
What's to make sense of?
I mean, isn't it as simple as the perp was looking for more baseball cards?
Or hopped up on speed or whatever and went nuts with the vandalism?
Yeah.
I mean, that could be.
Yeah.
Pretty sweet Hummer parked in the driveway.
That yours?
Yeah, that's mine.
Uh, it's a lease.
Got a great deal on it.
It's very sweet.
You know, they say Arnold Schwarzenegger is the reason that Hummers exist.
I don't know how, but that's what they say.
- No kidding.
- Yeah.
Huh.
What kind of work do you do, Mr. Wormald?
Uh, I work I.T., uh, for a pharmaceutical company.
Wow.
Computers.
God, I should've gotten into computers.
- I'd have that same Hummer.
- [Chuckles] Yeah, right.
Look, guys, I'm glad you like my car, but I think we're looking through the wrong end of the telescope here.
You know, the priority is my baseball cards.
Of course.
Yes, now, I have a detailed manifest of my entire collection and asterisks next to the high-ticket items, so it's clear which ones they're gonna try to fence first, 'cause they're super, super valuable.
So you're gonna want to get this list out to pawnshops, uh, collectors, question anyone who's done any sort of crime like this in the past.
You know, the... the usual suspects.
Uh, can I get you the list so you can start investigating?
Yeah, you...
Yeah, if you could get us that list...
Okay, I'll...
I'll print it out.
Hank Aaron, mint.
God, my signed Derek Jeter.
Willie Mays, O-Pee-Chee.
Got to breathe.
Just keep breathing.
Keep breathing.
- Okay.
- I know, right?
Left the TV.
-Uh-huh.
- Left the computer.
- Right.
Huh.

Oh, yeah, you're all red back here.
Yeah.
That feels good, babe.

You don't listen.
Yeah, it's me again.
Listen, as I speak, not 25 feet away from me,
I'm looking at the mark.

[Chuckles] Come, Kim.
Join me.
Join the pride.
Um, I said "lioness"
because it's the females who do all the hunting.
Uh, just wanted to be species-accurate, irrespective of my own sex.

There are a few options on the company cars.
We can arrange a test-drive whenever you'd like.
Company car... wow.
And there's a service that will deliver it right to you, wherever you want.
And if you find you're not happy with it, it's not a big deal to change it out.
That sounds really, uh...
[Sighs] Yeah.
This is, uh, interesting.
Oh, if, uh... [Chuckles]
If this isn't to your taste, we have a collection of art in-house you can, uh, choose from.
Anytime you're ready,
I can put together some samples for you to review.
I...
I...
No, I like this.
Good.
Uh, well, any other needs you have, I'm here to help.
Office supplies, dietary needs...
Anything special you want stocked in the fridge?
Uh, maybe a humidifier?
Gets kind of dry in here.
Omar, I...
I'm pretty low-maintenance.
Sure.
Well, if there's anything you need,
I'm right outside the door.
Great.
If I think of anything.
Good.
Hey, do you think, um...
I'm just looking at this.
D-Do we get a choice of desks?
What were you thinking?
Um... is it possible, um...
Can we do... cocobolo?
Cocobolo desk?
Absolutely.
I'll get right on that.

Why were you working against me?
You're not a real lawyer!
Now that I'm doing the job alone, I get the full 1500.
I can get more pills.
If you're gonna be a criminal, do your homework.
Thanks for not heading to the Bahamas with this.
- What are you doing?
- "The right thing."
Whatever it was, did you get it out of your system?
Yep, all gone.
(Kim) The Sandpiper case?
It's getting too big for HHM.
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about there's an office in Santa Fe with your name on it.

Oh, great.
Jimmy, right on time.
Good to see you.
Hello, Howard.
Hey.
Hi.
James McGill, Clifford Main.
Just "Jimmy." And it's a pleasure to meet you, Clifford.
Likewise.
We know all about your work on Sandpiper.
Well, it's a group effort.
I mean, the folks at HHM are just knocking it out of the park.
Well, you know, the case wouldn't exist without you.
Absolutely.
Once you get him on your team, you'll know why I call him "Charlie Hustle."
Jimmy, these are my associates...

- Nice to meet you both.

I mean, uh...
Does it mean, uh...
What?
What...
What the hell is this?
If I take this job today, with Davis and Main [clears throat] does that mean that you and me...
Is this...
Is this gonna happen?
Jimmy, I...
I...
[Sighs]
One thing has absolutely nothing to do with the other.
Nothing at all.
No.
Of course not.
Why would it?
Great. [Sighs]
Uh, sorry about that.
Listen, I just want to say thank you, sincerely,
For your interest in me.
It's an honor to be considered,
But at this time...
At this time...
Um, I'm gonna have to take myself out of the running.
Thanks.
Thank you, Howard.
Uh, Jimmy?
[brakes screech]
Mike:
Well, that was quick.
No charge.
Help me out here.
Did I dream it,
Or did I have $1,600,000 on my desk in cash?
No one on god's green earth knew we had it.
We could've split it 50/50.
We could've gone home with $800,000... each!
Tax-free!
Your point being?
Why didn't we?
I remember you saying something about doing the right thing.
You want to know why I didn't take that money?
Is that what you're asking?
Yeah, that's what I'm asking.
Me, personally, I was hired to do a job.
I did it.
That's as far as it goes.
Yeah.
Well, I know what stopped me.
And you know what?
It's never stopping me again.

I have a business to run.
Uh, no.
The business is running you.
Listen to me.
You'll thank me later.

Hey!
It's me!
[brake squeaks]
Geez.
Hello?
Hello?
It's me.
I got a new car.
You like it?
We're not taking that to the meet.
How are we gonna get there?
I'll drive.
My car.
Why?
This business requires restraint.
That is the opposite of restraint.
But...
I like it.
I mean, I'm proud of it.
Good.
Then you be proud of it on your own time, but not with me.
I'm not getting in that.
Okay.
Then... then don't.
Honestly, uh, you don't really do anything.
I've been paying you the salary of three people to just stand behind me.
You know?
And...
And these...
these last few deals...
This Nacho fella, he's been coming alone.
I mean, if he doesn't need backup men, then, I mean, why do I need you?
I should just go alone.
I'm throwing...
I'm throwing away money.
Just tossing it away.
Into the trash.
Look, you do whatever you want, but I'm advising you...
do not go to that meet without someone watching your back.
Yeah, well, of course you're gonna say that.
I mean, you don't want to be out of this easy-peasy job.
Well, I'm sorry, but this is the gravy train, and it's leaving the station right now.
So last chance.
All aboard.
Seriously, last chance.
I'm gonna count to, say, 10, and then I'm...
All right, then.
Your services are no longer needed!
[Bird cawing]
[Engine shuts off]
Hola.
No old guy?
What, did he break a hip or something?
[Chuckles] I know, right?
Yeah, no, we, uh...
We... we parted ways.
Yeah, saw things differently.
So...
You know how it is.
This is interesting.
Oh, yeah.
You like it?
Can I take a look?
Oh.
Be my guest.
Get in.
[Chuckles] Check it out.
Wow.
Impressive.
Thank you.
Get in.
Feel the leather.
Yeah, it's a H2.
Brand-new off the line.
Slimmer than the H1 but longer, more height.
Yeah, it's a honey.
V-8 engine, 325 horsepower, tri-zone climate controls.
So you can have a girl in a bikini and another in a parka, and they're both gonna be comfortable. [Chuckles]
You're running around with two girls in your S.U.V., you'd be really comfortable, huh?
Oh, yeah.
Yes.
[Chuckles]
I'm gonna count this quick.
Do your thing.
Make sure it's right.
Okeydokey.
We are good.
Uh, same as before.
Uh, still factory-sealed.
And, as always, you're welcome to count them.
I trust you.
Great.
Thank you.
See you next time.
[Door closes]
[Cellphone ringing]
[Cellphone beeps]
Hello?
Yes.
Uh, no.
Sorry.
But...
Yes, this is James McGill, but I'm no longer a lawyer, so...
That's right... not a lawyer.
Bye.
[Cellphone beeps]
[Sighs]
So, this is what a midlife crisis looks like?
Not midlife crisis.
Clarity.
Midlife clarity.
Clarity?
Huh.
Clearly explain to me why you walked out on the best job opportunity of your life.
[Sighs]
Get in the pool, and I'll tell ya.
Get in the pool?
[Chuckling] Yeah.
Come on.
Just pop in the gift shop and buy a bathing suit... get a one-piece, nothing fancy.
The water is perfect.
It's 82 degrees.
You can order a drink.
And you got to try this crab dip.
Why are you acting like this?
I'm not acting like anything.
I just... finally decided to be me.
Everything okay, Mr. Cumpston?
Would you like another drink?
Uh, I'm good with this.
I'll tell you what, Mr. Cumpston.
If you really want to talk, I'll be in the bar.
Not for long.
Hey, Rolando.
Check.
What do...
What do you mean "quit the law"?
- [ "Buena Vista" plays in background]
- I quit it.
Simple as that.
Oh, well, thanks for explaining, Jimmy.
- It's super-clear now.
- Hey, buddy?
Uh, is that a misprint right there?
It's got to be, right?
- The Zafiro Anejo?
- Yeah.
That's correct, actually, believe it or not.
Holy shit.
A $50 shot of tequila?
Is it worth it?
Apparently.
I mean, it's kind of a personal-choice kind of thing.
Well, I can't die without trying a $50 shot of tequila, so, uh... two... dos... neat.
And, uh, we can charge that to the room, can't we?
No, we can't.
We...
I am paying.
And he will be having a shot of your well brand, and I'll have a glass of your house red.
We have a Cabernet, a Pinot, and a Syrah.
Whatever.
Dealer's choice.
Something with alcohol.
You got it.
[Sighs]
Jimmy... did something happen in Cicero?
Why did something have to happen in Cicero?
Because when I talked to you about Davis Main, you were ready to take the job.
Now you're back, and you're suddenly quitting the law, cheating hotels out of expensive liquor, wearing a weird pinkie ring?
What, are you in the Mafia now?
Asking if we have a future.
I mean, where did that come from?
I don't know.
I just...
Well, Cicero has nothing to do with it.
It's my whole life.
Well, my life since Chuck made me come to Albuquerque.
Ever since I got here, all I've done is try to make Chuck happy, bend over backwards to please Chuck.
Chuck, Chuck, Chuck.
Well, no more.
You quitting the law... isn't that exactly what Chuck wants?
Who cares?
This is for me, okay?
I-I got into the law for all the wrong reasons.
I'm trusting my instincts.
I think that my talents are better spent elsewhere.
Where?
Floating in somebody else's pool?
- [Scoffs] - [Sighs]
Jimmy, you're a great lawyer.
Why give that up?
I'm not saying it didn't have its moments, but the stuff I liked about it... selling people, convincing people...
I don't have to be a lawyer to do that.
Besides, people tell me how they see me, and it's not as a lawyer.
All right.
Here you go.
Thank you.
Lemme know if I can get you guys anything else, okay?
KEN:
Bobby, what up, brother man?
Oh, thanks.
Short it.
Short it.
Short it.
Short that shit.
That stock is useless.
It's got no legs.
It's like a circus freak minus the fun.
And that one's even worse.
Who's giving you these?
Please do me a favor.
Take a pillow, put it over that stock's face until you hear the deathbed queef.
- KEN:
It's a loser.
- Okay, so... if you're not gonna be a lawyer, then what?
Float around and wait for your Sandpiper money to roll in?
No.
That could take years.
Sandpiper has no bearing on this at all.
Yeah, it's got legs.
Okay, then, what's the plan?
To be open to the universe.
Okay, so no plan.
Just walk the Earth, like Jules at the end of "Pulp Fiction"?
Look, whatever the universe presents, whatever opportunity arises, I will take it.
- Whatever opportunity?
- Yeah.
Wasn't Davis Main an opportunity?
It's a great opportunity, and you're walking away from it.
Not him, not the guy who...
Look, shouldn't you at least try the job before you say no?
And waste everyone's time, including my own?
Kim, I appreciate your concern, but it's not for me.
I don't want it.
Jimmy, do you remember how long you studied for that bar?
How hard you worked?
All that effort, you're just gonna toss it away?
That's the Sunk Cost Fallacy.
W...
The what?
The Fallacy of Sunk Cost...
It's what gamblers do.
They throw good money after bad thinking they can turn their luck around.
It's like, "I've already spent this much money or time... whatever.
I got to keep going!"
No, there's no reward at the end of this game.
You are making a mistake.
I know you're making a mistake.
I've been doing the "right" thing for all these years now, and where has it gotten me?
Nowhere.
I'm sorry.
I don't...
[Sighs]
[ "Transatlantic" plays in background]
It's not my thing.
I don't get it.
- I just don't get it.
- It's what's right for me.
[Laughs]
Donkey balls.
Pure donkey balls, dude.
Wall Street's for suckers.
Who needs that aggravation?
If the the Oracle doesn't have to live there, then I sure as hell don't.
I can make a million-dollar stock trade on my laptop sitting on a toilet.
Like Midas, shitting gold bricks on my throne.
That's why Speigelman and Deitch want my business so bad.
I'm a golden God.
Look, of course I remember that.
Who forgets a thing like that?
That fart had the anger of a repressed minority community.
You fart like that in someone's face, you're gonna give them pinkeye for life.
[Laughs]
Good convo, bro.
Till next time, brutha-man.
- Flip side.
On it.
- Come with me.
- What?
- Just come on.
Trust me.
What are you gonna do?
You want to understand what I'm talking about?
Follow my lead.
[Indistinct conversations]
Hey, buddy, could you settle a bet for us?
- I what?
- Uh, sorry.
I don't want to make it sound like I was eavesdropping, but I kind of was.
Uh, we heard you talking about stocks.
Uh-huh.
Yeah, so, question... if you could settle a debate between me and my sister.
Uh, you know what?
We probably shouldn't be bothering this...
We wouldn't normally do this...
Right?
but we need an expert.
This guy sounds like he knows his stuff.
Yeah, go.
Okay.
Here's the question.
Uh, when it comes to the stock market, is there, like, a financial limit to how much a person's allowed to invest?
A limit?
No.
No limit.
Knew it.
Oh, even if it's an inheritance?
You know, with, like, inheritance taxes and whatnot?
Nope.
Same.
That's...
Oh, fantastic.
Thank you, buddy.
See?
No limit.
Told you we could invest it all.
And it's a smart move, too.
Sticking it all in the bank?
No.
Um, yeah.
You can... invest all your money.
Just make sure you diversify.
Yeah.
Diversify.
[Clicks tongue] That's...
You got to...
Oh, hey, um...
What do you mean, "diversify"?
Well, diversify is...
Y-You know that saying,
"Don't put all your eggs in one basket," right?
Same principle.
No, it makes complete sense.
Thank you.
Now, if I had an idea of the money we're talking about...
Ballpark...
I could give you examples of smart diversification.
[Sighs] Yeah, um...
Look, an uncle on our father's side recently passed, and he left us somewhere in the neighborhood of $1.4 million.
And I don't mean to be greedy, but I think, if we invest it smart now, we could double it, triple it... we could quadruple the whole inheritance, right?
In my opinion?
Fortune favors the bold, man.
Now, if you guys are free to join me for a drink,
I can give you a quick consult.
That's all right.
We were gonna do it ourselves through one of those online brokerage websites.
We're just gonna pick, uh, a classic, like...
I think they're called blue-chip stocks?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you can totally do it yourself.
Shoot for the tried and true.
'Course, you might be putting your cash in the Hindenburg, the Andrea Doria, uh..."Corky Romano."
- [Chuckles]
- Right?
They all seemed rock-solid beforehand, but then...
Yeah, not good.
Not good, yeah.
So, how do you know?
Well, that's where someone like myself comes in.
Proven track record as a wealth manager.
I take calculated but aggressive risks 'cause I want to catch lightning.
And I do.
Practically a money-printing machine.
[Chuckling] That sounds good.
A money-printing machine.
Listen, there's a little booth over here.
There's some privacy.
We can talk.
No obligations.
We can just... just rap about this a little bit.
- Yeah, I guess.
- Yeah?
What do you say, sis?
Can we just talk?
Electric slide on in there.
And we'll just rap a little bit.
It's no...
My name's Ken, by the way.
Uh, Viktor, with a "K."
Cool.
Viktor with a "K."
And this lovely lady is?
It's...
Giselle.
Giselle Saint Claire.
Ah, lovely.
Please, sit.
I won't bite.
So, Viktor with a "K" and Giselle... exotic names.
JIMMY:
They're Dutch.
Well, Boer, to be precise.
Our... father's side of the family is from South Africa, which is where uncle Humphrey passed away.
South Africa.
They grow them beautiful down there, right?
Charlize Theron.
And you.
Oh.
Well...
I've never actually been, but hope to go someday.
Tell you what, by the time I'm done with you two, you might be taking your own private jet.
Nice.
Excuse me.
Hi.
Uh, we are sitting here now, so, uh, we could use a wine list, if you get a chance...
Hey, uh, are a tequila fan?
Yes.
You down for that?
You ever try Zafiro Anejo?
No, I have not, but I'm down for whatever.
Three of whatever she just said.
- You got it.
- All right.
So, stock market.
A great investment.
And you're picking the right time to jump in.
- [ "Goldigger" plays in background]
- Why do you listen to me?
I'm an idiot.
[Laughs]
And talks about his cars, talks about...
[Jimmy and Ken laugh]
- How many cars did he have?
- I don't think...
[Laughter]
- It doesn't make sense.
- That's it, Ken.
Oh, yeah.
Compliments of the bartender.
She thought you might want a souvenir.
Oh, my God.
Did we drink the entire bottle?
Not yet, we didn't.
- Boom.
- Hey, hey, cheers.
Uh, I think we're ready for the check.
[Laughter]
[Groans]
No, really, it's the smart way to go.
KIM:
Okay.
But, so, to be clear, you take the money directly from our account and invest it.
- Diversify.
- Diversify it.
And then all the dividends and all the profits and the...what-have-you comes back into our account.
Boom.
Absolutely.
And you'll get a detailed statement showing you how much your money is growing... biggest bulls of the month, et cetera.
Ken, buddy...
let's do this.
Great.
Right there, Viktor with a "K,"
and, Giselle, you are next.
- This is so exciting.
- Mm-hmm.
Folks, it's been a pleasure.
- Oops, I got that.
- Can't let you do it, son.
Wait.
What?
Ken, you are the greatest.
Thank you.
-No problem-o.
Hey, this will be the best decision you'll ever make.
Oh, I believe it.
All right, well, we should get out of your hair.
- Yeah.
- Oh, wait, wait.
This... is for you.
Now, that's got all my contact info.
Call me anytime with questions or anything at all.
Ken.
Bye.
Call me, guys.
- Bye.
- Try and stop us.
[Laughs]
Wow.
[Chuckles]
Just wow.
[Inhales deeply]
[Chuckles]
[Exhales slowly]
Hey.
What I...
Is this right?
Yes, sir, it is.
- ["Music Wine" plays in background]
- KIM:
Go, go, go, go, go!
[Both laugh]
- Zafiro Anejo!
- Shh!
He's gonna come out. [Laughs]
Oh, no.
I didn't read the fine print.
- Wait.
- Yeah!
[Both laugh]
Holy crap.
I can't b...
[Laughing]
[Breathes deeply]
[Chuckles]
[Chuckles]
[Laughter, indistinct conversations]
[Water turns on]
Can I borrow that when you're done?
[Chuckles] No, that's gross.
H-how is it gross?
Our germs have already intermingled.
It's my toothbrush.
It's different.
Why is it different?
Because.
You know, gums bleed, and there's... there's cold sores, all sorts of food and weir...
Let me see that.
Come on.
What?
No!
Come on!
I'll do it right now.
- I don't care.
- I need to brush my teeth.
I don't have an extra.
It's not my problem.
That's fine.
I got this.
Good.
I'm fine with this.
Yeah, me too.
Wait till you see what I floss with.
[Laughing]
[Jewelry clattering]
That's a keeper.
[Chuckles] Thank you, Viktor with a "K."
Hey, wouldn't it be great if we could do that every night?
Yes, it would.
But...
We can't.
I know, yeah.
But I'm just saying, if we could, it would be great.
But I know we can't.
Oh, crap.
I can't be late today.
Howard is doling out assignments, and the last one through the door could get stuck in doc review.
You got somewhere to go?
Yeah.
Uh, yeah, I got somewhere.
You good?
[Sighs] Yeah.
All good.
[Door closes]
[Dog barks in distance]
[Brakes squeak]
[Engine shuts off]
[Police radio chatter]
[Barking continues]
[Knock on door]
Daniel Wormald?
I'm Officer Baker.
This is Officer Saxton.
Yeah, please.
Come on in.
Come in.
It's over here.
See what they did?
I mean, all gone.
All of them, just...
Uh, what's all gone?
I have...
I had a baseball-card collection... a major collection...
All stolen.
Oh, sorry to hear that.
Uh, was it common knowledge that you have baseball cards?
No, not really.
So, nobody in particular you can think of wanting them?
No.
Not that I...
No.
How'd they get in?
Uh, the back door over here.
It was open when I came home for lunch.
I mean, it was locked, but they must have jimmied it open or something.
Uh-huh.
At what time, uh, you figure this happened?
I left for work at 8:15, came home for lunch at 12:30, and called you immediately.
Was anything else taken?
Cash... a fair bit.
Uh, um...
How much cash?
Uh, I don't know.
You know, let's focus on what's important here, you know?
All I really care about are my baseball cards.
You know, I have a Topps Mickey Mantle rookie card that's irreplaceable.
It's a mint, 60/40, 90/10 on the reverse.
I can go on.
All my cards are in top-loaders, but if they're taken out and exposed to the elements,
I mean, or creased, God forbid,
I mean, you're looking at a 9-point downgrade in a matter of seconds.
I understand the first 48 hours are the most important in investigations like this, so the more time passes,
I mean, the less likely we are of a recovery.
So...time is of the essence here, guys.
Well, we're gonna help you out the best we can, Mr. Wormald.
Good.
Well...they really tossed this place.
-[Scoffs]
-I mean, are you sure they weren't looking for anything else?
Like what?
I don't know.
J-Just wondering your thoughts.
I assume more baseball cards.
Did you have more baseball cards than the ones you keep locked in that case here?
Yes, in... in back... thousands.
But these were the crown jewels over here.
You know, t-the all-star lineup.
Right.
Hmm.
What?
Just trying to make sense of it.
What's to make sense of?
I mean, isn't it as simple as the perp was looking for more baseball cards?
Or hopped up on speed or whatever and went nuts with the vandalism?
Yeah.
I mean, that could be.
Yeah.
Pretty sweet Hummer parked in the driveway.
That yours?
Yeah, that's mine.
Uh, it's a lease.
Got a great deal on it.
It's very sweet.
You know, they say Arnold Schwarzenegger is the reason that Hummers exist.
I don't know how, but that's what they say.
- No kidding.
- Yeah.
Huh.
What kind of work do you do, Mr. Wormald?
Uh, I work I.T., uh, for a pharmaceutical company.
Wow.
Computers.
God, I should've gotten into computers.
- I'd have that same Hummer.
- [Chuckles] Yeah, right.
Look, guys, I'm glad you like my car, but I think we're looking through the wrong end of the telescope here.
You know, the priority is my baseball cards.
Of course.
Yes, now, I have a detailed manifest of my entire collection and asterisks next to the high-ticket items, so it's clear which ones they're gonna try to fence first, 'cause they're super, super valuable.
So you're gonna want to get this list out to pawnshops, uh, collectors, question anyone who's done any sort of crime like this in the past.
You know, the... the usual suspects.
Uh, can I get you the list so you can start investigating?
Yeah, you...
Yeah, if you could get us that list...
Okay, I'll...
I'll print it out.
Hank Aaron, mint.
God, my signed Derek Jeter.
Willie Mays, O-Pee-Chee.
Got to breathe.
Just keep breathing.
Keep breathing.
- Okay.
- I know, right?
Left the TV.
-Uh-huh.
- Left the computer.
- Right.
Huh.
There's something wrong with this picture.
[Printer whirring in distance]
[Flashlight clicks]
[Sighs]
[Flashlight clicks]
[Sighs]
[Dialing]
Hey, it's me.
Another perfect day in paradise out here.
I'm in the pool.
Okay, call me.
[Cellphone beeps]
- Hi!
How are you?
- Hey, babe.
Did you get lunch?
WOMAN:
I did.
MAN:
You know, I think I'm burning up back here.
Oh, really?
Well, you're just in luck.
- Look what I have.
- Oh, hey, great.
Oh, yeah, you're all red back here.
Yeah.
That feels good, babe.
- [Dialing]
- I told you not to spend so much time in the sun.
You don't listen.
Yeah, it's me again.
Listen, as I speak, not 25 feet away from me,
I'm looking at the mark.
Think Thurston Howell III if he shacked up with Ginger.
[Chuckles] He's dripping in Gucci.
It's like I'm at the watering hole, and I'm watching the fattest, slowest water buffalo expose his neck to me, and I'm the lioness ready to strike.
[Chuckles] Come, Kim.
Join me.
Join the pride.
Um, I said "lioness"
because it's the females who do all the hunting.
Uh, just wanted to be species-accurate, irrespective of my own sex.
It's a National Geographic thing.
Anyway...
Get out here.
Bye.
[Cellphone beeps]
[Lawnmower running in distance]
[Chuckles]
[Dialing]
Santa Fe, New Mexico.
I need the number of a law firm...
Davis Main.
Yeah, you can connect me.
[Indistinct conversations]
[Telephone rings in distance]
WOMAN:
Davis Main.
OMAR:
There are a few options on the company cars.
We can arrange a test-drive whenever you'd like.
Company car... wow.
And there's a service that will deliver it right to you, wherever you want.
And if you find you're not happy with it, it's not a big deal to change it out.
That sounds really, uh...
[Sighs] Yeah.
This is, uh, interesting.
Oh, if, uh... [Chuckles]
If this isn't to your taste, we have a collection of art in-house you can, uh, choose from.
Anytime you're ready,
I can put together some samples for you to review.
I...
I...
No, I like this.
Good.
Uh, well, any other needs you have, I'm here to help.
Office supplies, dietary needs...
Anything special you want stocked in the fridge?
Uh, maybe a humidifier?
Gets kind of dry in here.
Omar, I...
I'm pretty low-maintenance.
Sure.
Well, if there's anything you need,
I'm right outside the door.
Great.
If I think of anything.
Good.
Hey, do you think, um...
I'm just looking at this.
D-Do we get a choice of desks?
What were you thinking?
Um... is it possible, um...
Can we do... cocobolo?
Cocobolo desk?
Absolutely.
I'll get right on that.

[Telephone rings in distance]
Previously on "Better Call Saul..."
Why were you working against me?
You're not a real lawyer!
Now that I'm doing the job alone, I get the full 1500.
I can get more pills.
If you're gonna be a criminal, do your homework.
Thanks for not heading to the Bahamas with this.
- What are you doing?
- "The right thing."
Whatever it was, did you get it out of your system?
Yep, all gone.
The Sandpiper case?
It's getting too big for HHM.
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about there's an office in Santa Fe with your name on it.
Good night, ladies.
Get home safe.
See you later, Gene.
Good night.
No, no, no, no!
God damn it!
No!
Oh, c-come on.
Hey!
Hey!
Somebody!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Ah, here he is.
Oh, great.
Jimmy, right on time.
Good to see you.
Hello, Howard.
Hey.
Hi.
James McGill, Clifford Main.
Just "Jimmy." And it's a pleasure to meet you, Clifford.
Likewise.
We know all about your work on Sandpiper.
Well, it's a group effort.
I mean, the folks at HHM are just knocking it out of the park.
Well, you know, the case wouldn't exist without you.
Absolutely.
Once you get him on your team, you'll know why I call him "Charlie Hustle."
Jimmy, these are my associates...
Brian Archuleta and Erin Brill.
- Nice to meet you both.
- It's great to meet you.
I hate to do this, but, um, could I borrow Ms. Wexler for a moment?
If you will excuse us?
Pardon me.
What's going on?
I just, um
Listen, here's the thing.
If I take this job, does that mean the two of us...
I mean, uh...
Does it mean, uh...
What?
What...
What the hell is this?
If I take this job today, with Davis and Main does that mean that you and me...
Is this...
Is this gonna happen?
Jimmy, I...
I...
One thing has absolutely nothing to do with the other.
Nothing at all.
No.
Of course not.
Why would it?
Great.
Uh, sorry about that.
Listen, I just want to say thank you, sincerely,
For your interest in me.
It's an honor to be considered,
But at this time...
At this time...
Um, I'm gonna have to take myself out of the running.
Thanks.
Thank you, Howard.
Uh, Jimmy?
Well, that was quick.
No charge.
Help me out here.
Did I dream it,
Or did I have $1,600,000 on my desk in cash?
No one on god's green earth knew we had it.
We could've split it 50/50.
We could've gone home with $800,000... each!
Tax-free!
Your point being?
Why didn't we?
I remember you saying something about doing the right thing.
You want to know why I didn't take that money?
Is that what you're asking?
Yeah, that's what I'm asking.
Me, personally, I was hired to do a job.
I did it.
That's as far as it goes.
Yeah.
Well, I know what stopped me.
And you know what?
It's never stopping me again.
Chao cac co, ladies!
Chao cac co!
Mrs. Nguyen, it's a beautiful day out there.
You should get out of this place once in a while.
You know, throw a frisbee, have some fun.
I have a business to run.
Uh, no.
The business is running you.
Listen to me.
You'll thank me later.
Cucumber water for customer only.
Hey!
It's me!
Geez.
Hello?
Hello?
It's me.
I got a new car.
You like it?
We're not taking that to the meet.
How are we gonna get there?
I'll drive.
My car.
Why?
This business requires restraint.
That is the opposite of restraint.
But...
I like it.
I mean, I'm proud of it.
Good.
Then you be proud of it on your own time, but not with me.
I'm not getting in that.
Okay.
Then... then don't.
Honestly, uh, you don't really do anything.
I've been paying you the salary of three people to just stand behind me.
You know?
And...
And these...
these last few deals...
This Nacho fella, he's been coming alone.
I mean, if he doesn't need backup men, then, I mean, why do I need you?
I should just go alone.
I'm throwing...
I'm throwing away money.
Just tossing it away.
Into the trash.
Look, you do whatever you want, but I'm advising you...
do not go to that meet without someone watching your back.
Yeah, well, of course you're gonna say that.
I mean, you don't want to be out of this easy-peasy job.
Well, I'm sorry, but this is the gravy train, and it's leaving the station right now.
So last chance.
All aboard.
Seriously, last chance.
I'm gonna count to, say, 10, and then I'm...
All right, then.
Your services are no longer needed!
Hola.
No old guy?
What, did he break a hip or something?
I know, right?
Yeah, no, we, uh...
We... we parted ways.
Yeah, saw things differently.
So...
You know how it is.
This is interesting.
Oh, yeah.
You like it?
Can I take a look?
Oh.
Be my guest.
Get in.
Check it out.
Wow.
Impressive.
Thank you.
Get in.
Feel the leather.
Yeah, it's a H2.
Brand-new off the line.
Slimmer than the H1 but longer, more height.
Yeah, it's a honey.
V-8 engine, 325 horsepower, tri-zone climate controls.
So you can have a girl in a bikini and another in a parka, and they're both gonna be comfortable.
You're running around with two girls in your S.U.V., you'd be really comfortable, huh?
Oh, yeah.
Yes.
I'm gonna count this quick.
Do your thing.
Make sure it's right.
Okeydokey.
We are good.
Uh, same as before.
Uh, still factory-sealed.
And, as always, you're welcome to count them.
I trust you.
Great.
Thank you.
See you next time.
Hello?
Yes.
Uh, no.
Sorry.
But...
Yes, this is James McGill, but I'm no longer a lawyer, so...
That's right... not a lawyer.
Bye.
So, this is what a midlife crisis looks like?
Not midlife crisis.
Clarity.
Midlife clarity.
Clarity?
Huh.
Clearly explain to me why you walked out on the best job opportunity of your life.
Get in the pool, and I'll tell ya.
Get in the pool?
Yeah.
Come on.
Just pop in the gift shop and buy a bathing suit... get a one-piece, nothing fancy.
The water is perfect.
It's 82 degrees.
You can order a drink.
And you got to try this crab dip.
Why are you acting like this?
I'm not acting like anything.
I just... finally decided to be me.
Everything okay, Mr. Cumpston?
Would you like another drink?
Uh, I'm good with this.
I'll tell you what, Mr. Cumpston.
If you really want to talk, I'll be in the bar.
Not for long.
Hey, Rolando.
Check.
What do...
What do you mean "quit the law"?
I quit it.
Simple as that.
Oh, well, thanks for explaining, Jimmy.
- It's super-clear now.
- Hey, buddy?
Uh, is that a misprint right there?
It's got to be, right?
- The Zafiro Anejo?
- Yeah.
That's correct, actually, believe it or not.
Holy shit.
A $50 shot of tequila?
Is it worth it?
Apparently.
I mean, it's kind of a personal-choice kind of thing.
Well, I can't die without trying a $50 shot of tequila, so, uh... two... dos... neat.
And, uh, we can charge that to the room, can't we?
No, we can't.
We...
I am paying.
And he will be having a shot of your well brand, and I'll have a glass of your house red.
We have a Cabernet, a Pinot, and a Syrah.
Whatever.
Dealer's choice.
Something with alcohol.
You got it.
Jimmy... did something happen in Cicero?
Why did something have to happen in Cicero?
Because when I talked to you about Davis Main, you were ready to take the job.
Now you're back, and you're suddenly quitting the law, cheating hotels out of expensive liquor, wearing a weird pinkie ring?
What, are you in the Mafia now?
Asking if we have a future.
I mean, where did that come from?
I don't know.
I just...
Well, Cicero has nothing to do with it.
It's my whole life.
Well, my life since Chuck made me come to Albuquerque.
Ever since I got here, all I've done is try to make Chuck happy, bend over backwards to please Chuck.
Chuck, Chuck, Chuck.
Well, no more.
You quitting the law... isn't that exactly what Chuck wants?
Who cares?
This is for me, okay?
I-I got into the law for all the wrong reasons.
I'm trusting my instincts.
I think that my talents are better spent elsewhere.
Where?
Floating in somebody else's pool?
Jimmy, you're a great lawyer.
Why give that up?
I'm not saying it didn't have its moments, but the stuff I liked about it... selling people, convincing people...
I don't have to be a lawyer to do that.
Besides, people tell me how they see me, and it's not as a lawyer.
All right.
Here you go.
Thank you.
Lemme know if I can get you guys anything else, okay?
Bobby, what up, brother man?
Oh, thanks.
Short it.
Short it.
Short it.
Short that shit.
That stock is useless.
It's got no legs.
It's like a circus freak minus the fun.
And that one's even worse.
Who's giving you these?
Please do me a favor.
Take a pillow, put it over that stock's face until you hear the deathbed queef.
- It's a loser.
- Okay, so... if you're not gonna be a lawyer, then what?
Float around and wait for your Sandpiper money to roll in?
No.
That could take years.
Sandpiper has no bearing on this at all.
Yeah, it's got legs.
Okay, then, what's the plan?
To be open to the universe.
Okay, so no plan.
Just walk the Earth, like Jules at the end of "Pulp Fiction"?
Look, whatever the universe presents, whatever opportunity arises, I will take it.
- Whatever opportunity?
- Yeah.
Wasn't Davis Main an opportunity?
It's a great opportunity, and you're walking away from it.
Not him, not the guy who...
Look, shouldn't you at least try the job before you say no?
And waste everyone's time, including my own?
Kim, I appreciate your concern, but it's not for me.
I don't want it.
Jimmy, do you remember how long you studied for that bar?
How hard you worked?
All that effort, you're just gonna toss it away?
That's the Sunk Cost Fallacy.
W...
The what?
The Fallacy of Sunk Cost...
It's what gamblers do.
They throw good money after bad thinking they can turn their luck around.
It's like, "I've already spent this much money or time... whatever.
I got to keep going!"
No, there's no reward at the end of this game.
You are making a mistake.
I know you're making a mistake.
I've been doing the "right" thing for all these years now, and where has it gotten me?
Nowhere.
I'm sorry.
I don't...
It's not my thing.
I don't get it.
- I just don't get it.
- It's what's right for me.
Donkey balls.
Pure donkey balls, dude.
Wall Street's for suckers.
Who needs that aggravation?
If the the Oracle doesn't have to live there, then I sure as hell don't.
I can make a million-dollar stock trade on my laptop sitting on a toilet.
Like Midas, shitting gold bricks on my throne.
That's why Speigelman and Deitch want my business so bad.
I'm a golden God.
Look, of course I remember that.
Who forgets a thing like that?
That fart had the anger of a repressed minority community.
You fart like that in someone's face, you're gonna give them pinkeye for life.
Good convo, bro.
Till next time, brutha-man.
- Flip side.
On it.
- Come with me.
- What?
- Just come on.
Trust me.
What are you gonna do?
You want to understand what I'm talking about?
Follow my lead.
Hey, buddy, could you settle a bet for us?
- I what?
- Uh, sorry.
I don't want to make it sound like I was eavesdropping, but I kind of was.
Uh, we heard you talking about stocks.
Uh-huh.
Yeah, so, question... if you could settle a debate between me and my sister.
Uh, you know what?
We probably shouldn't be bothering this...
We wouldn't normally do this...
Right?
But we need an expert.
This guy sounds like he knows his stuff.
Yeah, go.
Okay.
Here's the question.
Uh, when it comes to the stock market, is there, like, a financial limit to how much a person's allowed to invest?
A limit?
No.
No limit.
Knew it.
Oh, even if it's an inheritance?
You know, with, like, inheritance taxes and whatnot?
Nope.
Same.
That's...
Oh, fantastic.
Thank you, buddy.
See?
No limit.
Told you we could invest it all.
And it's a smart move, too.
Sticking it all in the bank?
No.
Um, yeah.
You can... invest all your money.
Just make sure you diversify.
Yeah.
Diversify.
That's...
You got to...
Oh, hey, um...
What do you mean, "diversify"?
Well, diversify is...
Y-You know that saying,
"Don't put all your eggs in one basket," right?
Same principle.
No, it makes complete sense.
Thank you.
Now, if I had an idea of the money we're talking about...
Ballpark...
I could give you examples of smart diversification.
Yeah, um...
Look, an uncle on our father's side recently passed, and he left us somewhere in the neighborhood of $1.4 million.
And I don't mean to be greedy, but I think, if we invest it smart now, we could double it, triple it... we could quadruple the whole inheritance, right?
In my opinion?
Fortune favors the bold, man.
Now, if you guys are free to join me for a drink,
I can give you a quick consult.
That's all right.
We were gonna do it ourselves through one of those online brokerage websites.
We're just gonna pick, uh, a classic, like...
I think they're called blue-chip stocks?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you can totally do it yourself.
Shoot for the tried and true.
'Course, you might be putting your cash in the Hindenburg, the Andrea Doria, uh..."Corky Romano."
Right?
They all seemed rock-solid beforehand, but then...
Yeah, not good.
Not good, yeah.
So, how do you know?
Well, that's where someone like myself comes in.
Proven track record as a wealth manager.
I take calculated but aggressive risks 'cause I want to catch lightning.
And I do.
Practically a money-printing machine.
That sounds good.
A money-printing machine.
Listen, there's a little booth over here.
There's some privacy.
We can talk.
No obligations.
We can just... just rap about this a little bit.
- Yeah, I guess.
- Yeah?
What do you say, sis?
Can we just talk?
Electric slide on in there.
And we'll just rap a little bit.
It's no...
My name's Ken, by the way.
Uh, Viktor, with a "K."
Cool.
Viktor with a "K."
And this lovely lady is?
It's...
Giselle.
Giselle Saint Claire.
Ah, lovely.
Please, sit.
I won't bite.
So, Viktor with a "K" and Giselle... exotic names.
They're Dutch.
Well, Boer, to be precise.
Our... father's side of the family is from South Africa, which is where uncle Humphrey passed away.
South Africa.
They grow them beautiful down there, right?
Charlize Theron.
And you.
Oh.
Well...
I've never actually been, but hope to go someday.
Tell you what, by the time I'm done with you two, you might be taking your own private jet.
Nice.
Excuse me.
Hi.
Uh, we are sitting here now, so, uh, we could use a wine list, if you get a chance...
Hey, uh, are a tequila fan?
Yes.
You down for that?
You ever try Zafiro Anejo?
No, I have not, but I'm down for whatever.
Three of whatever she just said.
- You got it.
- All right.
So, stock market.
A great investment.
And you're picking the right time to jump in.
Why do you listen to me?
I'm an idiot.
And talks about his cars, talks about...
- How many cars did he have?
- I don't think...
- It doesn't make sense.
- That's it, Ken.
Oh, yeah.
Compliments of the bartender.
She thought you might want a souvenir.
Oh, my God.
Did we drink the entire bottle?
Not yet, we didn't.
- Boom.
- Hey, hey, cheers.
Uh, I think we're ready for the check.
No, really, it's the smart way to go.
Okay.
But, so, to be clear, you take the money directly from our account and invest it.
- Diversify.
- Diversify it.
And then all the dividends and all the profits and the...what-have-you comes back into our account.
Boom.
Absolutely.
And you'll get a detailed statement showing you how much your money is growing... biggest bulls of the month, et cetera.
Ken, buddy...
let's do this.
Great.
Right there, Viktor with a "K,"
and, Giselle, you are next.
- This is so exciting.
- Mm-hmm.
Folks, it's been a pleasure.
- Oops, I got that.
- Can't let you do it, son.
Wait.
What?
Ken, you are the greatest.
- Thank you.
- No problem-o.
Hey, this will be the best decision you'll ever make.
Oh, I believe it.
All right, well, we should get out of your hair.
- Yeah.
- Oh, wait, wait.
This... is for you.
Now, that's got all my contact info.
Call me anytime with questions or anything at all.
Ken.
Bye.
Call me, guys.
- Bye.
- Try and stop us.
Wow.
Just wow.
Hey.
What I...
Is this right?
Yes, sir, it is.
Go, go, go, go, go!
- Zafiro Anejo!
- Shh!
He's gonna come out.
Oh, no.
I didn't read the fine print.
- Wait.
- Yeah!
Holy crap.
I can't b...
Can I borrow that when you're done?
No, that's gross.
H-how is it gross?
Our germs have already intermingled.
It's my toothbrush.
It's different.
Why is it different?
Because.
You know, gums bleed, and there's... there's cold sores, all sorts of food and weir...
Let me see that.
Come on.
What?
No!
Come on!
I'll do it right now.
- I don't care.
- I need to brush my teeth.
I don't have an extra.
It's not my problem.
That's fine.
I got this.
Good.
I'm fine with this.
Yeah, me too.
Wait till you see what I floss with.
That's a keeper.
Thank you, Viktor with a "K."
Hey, wouldn't it be great if we could do that every night?
Yes, it would.
But...
We can't.
I know, yeah.
But I'm just saying, if we could, it would be great.
But I know we can't.
Oh, crap.
I can't be late today.
Howard is doling out assignments, and the last one through the door could get stuck in doc review.
You got somewhere to go?
Yeah.
Uh, yeah, I got somewhere.
You good?
Yeah.
All good.
Daniel Wormald?
I'm Officer Baker.
This is Officer Saxton.
Yeah, please.
Come on in.
Come in.
It's over here.
See what they did?
I mean, all gone.
All of them, just...
Uh, what's all gone?
I have...
I had a baseball-card collection... a major collection...
All stolen.
Oh, sorry to hear that.
Uh, was it common knowledge that you have baseball cards?
No, not really.
So, nobody in particular you can think of wanting them?
No.
Not that I...
No.
How'd they get in?
Uh, the back door over here.
It was open when I came home for lunch.
I mean, it was locked, but they must have jimmied it open or something.
Uh-huh.
At what time, uh, you figure this happened?
I left for work at 8:15, came home for lunch at 12:30, and called you immediately.
Was anything else taken?
Cash... a fair bit.
Uh, um...
How much cash?
Uh, I don't know.
You know, let's focus on what's important here, you know?
All I really care about are my baseball cards.
You know, I have a Topps Mickey Mantle rookie card that's irreplaceable.
It's a mint, 60/40, 90/10 on the reverse.
I can go on.
All my cards are in top-loaders, but if they're taken out and exposed to the elements,
I mean, or creased, God forbid,
I mean, you're looking at a 9-point downgrade in a matter of seconds.
I understand the first 48 hours are the most important in investigations like this, so the more time passes,
I mean, the less likely we are of a recovery.
So...time is of the essence here, guys.
Well, we're gonna help you out the best we can, Mr. Wormald.
Good.
Well...they really tossed this place.
I mean, are you sure they weren't looking for anything else?
Like what?
I don't know.
J-Just wondering your thoughts.
I assume more baseball cards.
Did you have more baseball cards than the ones you keep locked in that case here?
Yes, in... in back... thousands.
But these were the crown jewels over here.
You know, t-the all-star lineup.
Right.
Hmm.
What?
Just trying to make sense of it.
What's to make sense of?
I mean, isn't it as simple as the perp was looking for more baseball cards?
Or hopped up on speed or whatever and went nuts with the vandalism?
Yeah.
I mean, that could be.
Yeah.
Pretty sweet Hummer parked in the driveway.
That yours?
Yeah, that's mine.
Uh, it's a lease.
Got a great deal on it.
It's very sweet.
You know, they say Arnold Schwarzenegger is the reason that Hummers exist.
I don't know how, but that's what they say.
- No kidding.
- Yeah.
Huh.
What kind of work do you do, Mr. Wormald?
Uh, I work I.T., uh, for a pharmaceutical company.
Wow.
Computers.
God, I should've gotten into computers.
- I'd have that same Hummer.
- Yeah, right.
Look, guys, I'm glad you like my car, but I think we're looking through the wrong end of the telescope here.
You know, the priority is my baseball cards.
Of course.
Yes, now, I have a detailed manifest of my entire collection and asterisks next to the high-ticket items, so it's clear which ones they're gonna try to fence first, 'cause they're super, super valuable.
So you're gonna want to get this list out to pawnshops, uh, collectors, question anyone who's done any sort of crime like this in the past.
You know, the... the usual suspects.
Uh, can I get you the list so you can start investigating?
Yeah, you...
Yeah, if you could get us that list...
Okay, I'll...
I'll print it out.
Hank Aaron, mint.
God, my signed Derek Jeter.
Willie Mays, O-Pee-Chee.
Got to breathe.
Just keep breathing.
Keep breathing.
- Okay.
- I know, right?
- Left the TV.
- Uh-huh.
- Left the computer.
- Right.
Huh.
There's something wrong with this picture.
Hey, it's me.
Another perfect day in paradise out here.
I'm in the pool.
Okay, call me.
- Hi!
How are you?
- Hey, babe.
Did you get lunch?
I did.
You know, I think I'm burning up back here.
Oh, really?
Well, you're just in luck.
- Look what I have.
- Oh, hey, great.
Oh, yeah, you're all red back here.
Yeah.
That feels good, babe.
I told you not to spend so much time in the sun.
You don't listen.
Yeah, it's me again.
Listen, as I speak, not 25 feet away from me,
I'm looking at the mark.
Think Thurston Howell III if he shacked up with Ginger.
He's dripping in Gucci.
It's like I'm at the watering hole, and I'm watching the fattest, slowest water buffalo expose his neck to me, and I'm the lioness ready to strike.
Come, Kim.
Join me.
Join the pride.
Um, I said "lioness"
because it's the females who do all the hunting.
Uh, just wanted to be species-accurate, irrespective of my own sex.
It's a National Geographic thing.
Anyway...
Get out here.
Bye.
Santa Fe, New Mexico.
I need the number of a law firm...
Davis Main.
Yeah, you can connect me.
Davis Main.
There are a few options on the company cars.
We can arrange a test-drive whenever you'd like.
Company car... wow.
And there's a service that will deliver it right to you, wherever you want.
And if you find you're not happy with it, it's not a big deal to change it out.
That sounds really, uh...
Yeah.
This is, uh, interesting.
Oh, if, uh...
If this isn't to your taste, we have a collection of art in-house you can, uh, choose from.
Anytime you're ready,
I can put together some samples for you to review.
I...
I...
No, I like this.
Good.
Uh, well, any other needs you have, I'm here to help.
Office supplies, dietary needs...
Anything special you want stocked in the fridge?
Uh, maybe a humidifier?
Gets kind of dry in here.
Omar, I...
I'm pretty low-maintenance.
Sure.
Well, if there's anything you need,
I'm right outside the door.
Great.
If I think of anything.
Good.
Hey, do you think, um...
I'm just looking at this.
D-Do we get a choice of desks?
What were you thinking?
Um... is it possible, um...
Can we do... cocobolo?
Cocobolo desk?
Absolutely.
I'll get right on that.

MAN [OVER RADIO]: ... the problem with it is because they believe he's worth...
[BANGING]
MAN 2:
...the problem of the National Football the football from a player...
[BANGING] ...that took place.
Those were attitudes I mean, there are plenty of rules in play...
[♪♪♪]
MAN 1:
You can go.
KIM:
Ah.
Here he is.
HOWARD:
Great.
Jimmy, right on time.
Good to see you.
Hello, Howard.
- Hey.
Hi.
- James McGill, Clifford Main.
Just Jimmy.
It's a pleasure to meet you, Clifford.
Likewise.
We know all about your work on Sandpiper.
Well, it's a group effort.
I mean, the folks at HHM are just knocking it out of the park.
- The case wouldn't exist without you.
- Absolutely.
Once you get him on your team, you'll know why I call him Charlie Hustle.
Jimmy, these are my associates, Brian Archuleta and Erin Brill.
- Nice to meet you both.
- Great to meet you.
I hate to do this but could I borrow Ms. Wexler for a moment?
- If you will excuse us...
- Ahem.
Pardon me.
- What's going on?
- I just...
Ahem.
Listen, here's the thing.
If I take this job, does that mean the two of us...?
I mean...
- Does it mean...?
- What?
What?
What the hell is this?
If I take this job today with Davis Main does that mean that you and me...?
Is this...
Is this gonna happen?
Jimmy.
I...
I...
[SIGHS]
One thing has absolutely nothing to do with the other.
- Nothing at all?
- No.
Of course not, why would it?
Great.
Uh...
Sorry about that.
Listen, I just wanna say thank you, sincerely, for your interest in me.
It's an honor to be considered, but at this time...
At this time I'm gonna have to take myself out of the running.
Thanks.
- Thank you, Howard.
- Uh...
Jimmy?
MIKE:
Well, that was quick.
- No charge.
- Help me out here.
Did I dream it or did I have $1,600,000 on my desk in cash?
No one on God's green earth knew we had it.
We could've split it fifty-fifty.
We could've gone home with $800,000 each tax free.
Your point being?
Why didn't we?
I remember you saying something about doing the right thing.
You wanna know why I didn't take that money?
Is that what you're asking?
Yeah, that's what I'm asking.
Me personally, I was hired to do a job I did it, that's as far as it goes.
Yeah, well I know what stopped me.
And you know what?
It's never stopping me again.
[HUMMING]
Chào các cô, ladies.
Mrs. Nguyen, it's a beautiful day out, you should get out once in a while.
Throw a Frisbee, have some fun.
I have a business to run.
No, the business is running you.
Listen to me.
You'll thank me later.
Cucumber water for customer only.

[HUMMING]
Hey, it's me.
Jesus.
Hello?
Hello?
It's me.
I got a new car.
You like it?
We're not taking that to the meet.
How are we gonna get there?
I'll drive my car.
- Why?
- This business requires restraint.
That is the opposite of restraint.
But I like it.
I mean, I'm proud of it.
Good, then you be proud of it on your own time.
But not with me, I'm not getting in that.
Okay, then don't.
Honestly, you don't really do anything.
I've been paying you the salary of three people to just stand behind me.
You know?
And these last few deals, this Nacho fella, he's been coming alone.
I mean, if he doesn't need backup men, then, I mean, why do I need you?
I should just go alone.
I'm throwing...
I'm throwing away money.
Just tossing it away into the trash.
Look, you do whatever you want, but I'm advising you do not go to that meet without someone watching your back.
Yeah, well, of course you're gonna say that.
I mean, you don't wanna be out of this easy-peasy job.
Well, I'm sorry, but this is the gravy train and it's leaving the station right now.
So last chance.
All aboard.
Seriously, last chance.
I'm gonna count to, say, 10, and then I'm...
All right, then, your services are no longer needed.
[SPEAKS IN SPANISH]
No old guy?
What, did he break a hip or something?
I know, right?
Yeah, no, we...
We parted ways.
Yeah, saw things differently, so...
You know how it is.
This is interesting.
Oh, yeah.
You like it?
- Can I take a look?
- Oh, be my guest.
Get in, check it out.
Wow.
- Impressive.
- Thank you.
Get in, feel the leather.
Yeah, it's a H2.
Brand-new off the line.
Slimmer than the H1, but longer, more height.
Yeah, it's a honey.
V8 engine, 325 horsepower.
Tri-zone climate controls, so you can have a girl in a bikini and another in a parka, and they're both gonna be comfortable.
Ha-ha.
You're riding around with two girls in your SUV.
- You'd be really comfortable, huh?
- Oh, yeah.
Yes.
I'm gonna count this quick.
Do your thing, make sure it's right.
Okey-dokey, we are good.
Same as before.
Still factory sealed.
And as always, you're welcome to count them.
I trust you.
Great, thank you.
See you next time.
[CELL PHONE RINGING]
Hello.
Yes.
No, sorry.
Yes, this is James McGill, but I'm no longer a lawyer, so...
That's right, not a lawyer.
Bye.
[FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING]
KIM:
So this is what a midlife crisis looks like?
Not midlife crisis.
Clarity.
Midlife clarity.
Clarity?
Huh.
Clearly explain to me why you walked out on the best job opportunity of your life.
Get in the pool and I'll tell you.
- Get in the pool?
- Yeah, come on.
Pop in the gift shop and buy a bathing suit.
Get a one-piece, nothing fancy.
The water is perfect, it's 82 degrees.
You can order a drink, and you gotta try this crab dip.
- Why are you acting like this?
- I'm not acting like anything.
I just finally decided to be me.
Everything okay, Mr. Cumpston?
Would you like another drink?
I'm good with this.
I'll tell you what, Mr. Cumpston.
If you really wanna talk, I'll be in the bar.
Not for long.
Hey, Rolando, check.
What do you...
What do you mean, "quit the law"?
I quit it, simple as that.
Oh, well, thanks for explaining, Jimmy...
- ...it's super clear now.
- Hey, buddy?
Is that a misprint right there?
It's gotta be, right?
- The Zafiro Añejo?
- Yeah.
- That's correct, believe it or not.
- Holy shit, a $50 shot of tequila?
- Is it worth it?
- Apparently.
It's kind of a personal choice thing.
Well, I can't die without trying a $50 shot of tequila, so two.
Dos, neat, and we can charge that to the room, can't we?
No, we can't.
We...
I am paying.
And he will be having a shot of your well brand and I'll have a glass of your house red.
We have a cabernet, a pinot and a syrah.
Whatever, dealer's choice.
- Something with alcohol.
- You got it.
Jimmy.
Did something happen in Cicero?
JIMMY:
Why did something have to happen?
KIM:
When I talked to you about Davis Main,youwerereadytotakethejob .
Now you're back, and you're suddenly quitting the law?
Cheating hotels out of expensive liquor.
Wearing a weird pinkie ring.
What, are you in the Mafia now?
Asking if we have a future.
I mean, where did that come from?
I don't know, I just...
Cicero has nothing to do with it.
It's my whole life.
Well my life since Chuck made me come to Albuquerque.
Ever since I got here, all I've done is try to make Chuck happy.
Bend over backwards to please Chuck.
Chuck, Chuck, Chuck.
Well, no more.
You quitting the law, isn't that exactly what Chuck wants?
Who cares?
This is for me, okay?
I got into the law for all the wrong reasons.
I'm trusting my instincts.
I think that my talents are better spent elsewhere.
Where?
Floating in somebody else's pool?
[SCOFFS]
Jimmy, you're a great lawyer.
Why give that up?
I'm not saying it didn't have its moments.
But the stuff I liked about it, selling people, convincing people I don't have to be a lawyer to do that.
Besides, people tell me how they see me...
- ...and it's not as a lawyer.
WAITER:
All right.
- Here you go.
KIM:
Thank you.
WAITER:
Let me know if I can get you guys anything else.
MAN:
Bobby, what up, brother-man?
KIM:
Oh, thanks.
Short it.
Short it.
Short it.
Short that shit.
That stock is useless, it's got no legs.
It's like a circus freak minus the fun.
That one's even worse.
Who's giving you these?
Do me a favor.
Take a pillow put it over that stock's face until you hear the deathbed queef.
- Okay, so?
MAN:
It's a loser.
If you're not gonna be a lawyer, then what?
Float around and wait for your Sandpiper money to roll in?
- That could take years.
- Sandpiper has no bearing on this at all.
Okay, then, what's the plan?
- To be open to the universe.
- Okay, so no plan.
Just walk the earth?
Like Jules at the end of Pulp Fiction?
Look, whatever the universe presents, whatever opportunity arises...
- ...
I will take it.
- Whatever opportunity?
- Yeah.
- Wasn't Davis Main an opportunity?
It's a great opportunity, and you're walking away from it.
Look shouldn't you at least try the job before you say no?
And waste everyone's time, including my own?
Kim, I appreciate your concern but it's not for me.
I don't want it.
Jimmy, do you remember how long you studied for that bar?
- How hard you worked?
MAN:
It's like a burn victim...
All that effort, you're just gonna toss it away?
That's the sunk cost fallacy.
- The what?
- The fallacy of sunk cost.
It's what gamblers do, they throw good money after bad thinking they can turn their luck around.
It's like, "I've already spent this much money or time, whatever, I gotta keep going!"
No, there's no reward at the end of this game.
You are making a mistake.
I know you're making a mistake.
I've been doing the "right thing" and where has it gotten me?
- Nowhere.
- I'm sorry, I don't...
MAN:
Yeah.
Not my thing.
Not my thing.
Still not my thing.
- I don't get it.
I just don't get it.
- It's what's right for me.
MAN:
Ha-ha-ha.
Donkey balls.
Pure donkey balls, dude.
Wall Street's for suckers.
Who needs that aggravation?
If the Oracle doesn't have to live there, I don't.
I can make a million-dollar stock trade on my laptop sitting on a toilet.
Like Midas, shitting gold bricks on my throne.
That's why Spiegelman and Deitch want my business.
I'm a golden god.
Of course I remember.
Who forgets that?
That fart had the anger of a repressed minority community.
You fart like that in someone's face you're gonna give them pinkeye for life.
Ha-ha-ha.
Good convo, bro.
Till next time, brother-man.
- Flip side, on it, check you.
- Come with me.
- What?
- Just come on, trust me.
What are you gonna do?
You wanna understand what I'm talking about?
Follow my lead.
Hey, buddy, could you settle a bet for us?
- Can I what?
- Sorry I don't want it to sound like I was eavesdropping, but I kind of was.
We heard you talking about stocks.
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah, so question if you could settle a debate between me and my sister.
- We probably shouldn't bother...
- I wouldn't normally do this.
But we need an expert.
This guy sounds like he knows his stuff.
- Yeah, go.
- Okay, here's the question:
When it comes to the stock market, is there a financial limit to how much a person's allowed to invest?
A limit?
No, no limit.
Knew it!
Oh, even if it's an inheritance?
You know, with, like, inheritance taxes and whatnot?
- Nope, same.
- That's...
Oh, fantastic.
Thank you, buddy.
See, no limit.
Told you we could invest it all, and it's a smart move, too.
- Sticking it all in the bank?
No.
- Um...
Yeah, you can invest all your money, just make sure you diversify.
Yeah, diversify.
That's...
We gotta...
Hey what do you mean, "diversify"?
Well, diversify is...
You know the saying "don't put all your eggs in one basket"?
- Right?
Same principle.
- Makes complete sense.
Thank you.
If I had an idea of the money we're talking about, ballpark I could give you examples of smart diversification.
Yeah, um...
Look, an uncle on our father's side recently passed and he left us somewhere in the neighborhood of 1.4 million.
And I don't mean to be greedy, but I think if we invest it smart now we could double it, triple it we could quadruple the whole inheritance, right?
In my opinion?
Fortune favors the bold, man.
If you're free to join me for a drink, I can give you a consult.
That's all right, we'll do it ourselves through an online brokerage site.
We're just gonna pick classic...
Like, I think they're called blue chip stocks.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You can totally do it yourself.
Shoot for the tried and true.
Of course, you might be putting your cash in the Hindenburg, Andrea Doria Corky Romano.
Right?
They all seemed rock solid beforehand.
But then...
- Yeah, not good.
- Not good, yeah.
So how do you know?
Well, that's where someone like myself comes in.
Proven track record as a wealth manager.
I take calculated but aggressive risks because I wanna catch lightning, and I do.
- I'm practically a money-printing machine.
- That sounds good.
A money-printing machine.
Listen, there's a little booth over here, there's some privacy, we can talk.
No obligations, we can just rap about this a little bit.
- Yeah, I guess.
- Yeah?
What do you say, sis?
Can we just talk?
Electric slide on in there.
We'll rap a little, it's no...
- My name's Ken, by the way.
- Viktor, with a K.
Cool, Viktor with a K.
And this lovely lady is?
It's Giselle.
- Giselle Saint Claire.
- Ah.
Lovely.
KEN:
Please, sit.
I won't bite.
So Viktor with a K and Giselle, exotic names.
JIMMY:
They're Dutch.
- Well, Boer to be precise.
Our father's side of the family is from South Africa which is where Uncle Humphrey passed away.
South Africa, they grow them beautiful down there, right?
Charlize Theron.
- And you.
- Oh, well.
I've never actually been, but hope to go someday.
Tell you what, when I'm done with you...
- ...you might take your own private jet.
- Nice.
Excuse me, hi.
We are sitting here now.
We could use a wine list if you get a chance...
Hey, are you a tequila fan?
Yes.
You down for that?
You ever try Zafiro Añejo?
No, I have not, but I'm down for whatever.
Three of whatever she just said.
- You got it.
- All right.
So stock market, a great investment and you're picking the right time to jump in.
JIMMY:
Why do you listen to him?
He's an idiot.
He talks about his cars.
He talks about...
KEN:
How many cars did he have?
KIM:
I don't think...
[JIMMY AND KIM LAUGH]
KIM:
It makes sense.
JIMMY:
That's it, Ken.
Oh, yeah.
Compliments of the bartender.
Thought you might want a souvenir.
- My God, did we drink the entire bottle?
- Not yet, we didn't.
Right here.
Hey, hey, cheers.
I think we're ready for the check.
[COUGHS]
Oh...
No, really, it's a smart way to go.
Okay, but, so to be clear you take the money directly from our account...
- ...and invest it...
- Diversify it.
Diversify it.
And then all the dividends and all the profits and the what-have-you comes back into our account.
Boom.
Absolutely.
You'll get a statement showing how much your money is growing...
- ...biggest bulls of the month, etcetera.
- Ken, buddy let's do this.
Great.
Right there, Viktor with a K. And, Giselle, you are next.
- This is so exciting.
KEN:
Mm-hm.
WAITER:
Folks, it's been a pleasure.
- Oops.
I got that.
- Can't let you do it, son.
JIMMY:
Wait, what?
Ken.
- You are the greatest.
Thank you.
- No problemo.
This will be the best decision you'll make.
JIMMY:
We should get out of your hair.
- Yeah.
- Wait, wait, wait, this is for you.
Now, that's got all my contact info.
Call me anytime with questions, or anything at all.
- Ken.
- Bye.
Call me, guys.
- Bye.
- Try and stop us.
[KEN CHUCKLES]
Wow.
Heh.
Just wow.
[CHUCKLES]
Hey.
What...?
- Is this right?
- Yes, sir, it is.
KIM:
Go, go, go!
[LAUGHING]
- Zafiro Añejo!
- Shh!
Shut up.
He's gonna come out.
- Oh, no, I didn't read the fine print.
- Wait!
Yeah!
[LAUGHING]
- Holy crap.
- I can't...
[EXHALES]
[LAUGHS]
[LAUGHS]
Can I borrow that when you're done?
No, that's gross.
How is it gross?
Our germs have already intermingled.
It's my toothbrush, it's different.
- Why is it different?
- Because.
You know, gums bleed, and there's cold sores...
All sorts of food and weird...
- Come on.
- What?
No!
- Come on, I'll do it right now.
- I don't care.
- I need to brush my teeth.
- I don't have an extra.
That's fine.
I got this.
- Good, I'm fine with it.
- Yeah, me too.
Wait till you see what I floss with.
[LAUGHS]
That's a keeper.
Thank you, Viktor with a K.
Hey, wouldn't it be great if we could do that every night?
Yes, it would.
But we can't.
I know.
Yeah.
But I'm just saying, if we could it would be great.
But I know we can't.
Oh, crap, I can't be late today.
Howard is doling out assignments and the last one through the door could get stuck in Doc Review.
You got somewhere to go?
Yeah.
Yeah, I got somewhere.
You good?
JIMMY:
Yeah, all good.
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]
Daniel Wormald.
I'm Officer Baker, this is Officer Saxton.
Yeah, please, come on in.
Come in, it's over here.
See what they did?
I mean, all gone.
All of them.
- Just...
- What's all gone?
I have...
I had a baseball card collection.
- A major collection, all stolen.
- Sorry to hear that.
Was it common knowledge that you have baseball cards?
No, not really.
So nobody in particular you can think of wanted them?
No, not that I...
No.
- How'd they get in?
- The back door over here.
It was open when I came home for lunch.
I mean, it was locked but they must have jimmied it open or something.
Uh-huh.
What time you figure this happened?
DANIEL:
I left for work at 8:15, came home for lunch at 12:30...
- ...and called you immediately.
- Was anything else taken?
DANIEL:
Cash, a fair bit.
- How much cash?
Uh, I don't know.
You know, let's focus on what's important here.
You know, all I really care about are my baseball cards.
I have a Topps Mickey Mantle rookie card that's irreplaceable.
It's a mint, 60-40, 90-10 on the reverse.
I can go on.
All my cards are in top-loaders but if they're taken out and exposed to the elements I mean, or creased, God forbid I mean, you're looking at a 9-point downgrade in a matter of seconds.
I understand the first 48 hours are most important in investigations like this so the more time passes, I mean, the less likely we are of a recovery.
So time is of the essence here, guys.
Well, we're gonna help you out the best we can, Mr. Wormald.
Good.
[MUMBLES]
They really tossed this place.
Are you sure they weren't looking for anything else?
- Like what?
- I don't know.
Just wondering your thoughts.
I assume more baseball cards.
Did you have more than the ones in the case here?
Yes, in back.
Thousands.
But these were the crown jewels over here.
You know, the all-star lineup.
Right.
Hm.
- What?
- Just trying to make sense of it.
What's to make sense of?
I mean, isn't it as simple as the perp was looking for more baseball cards?
Or hopped up on speed or whatever and went nuts with the vandalism?
Yeah.
I mean, that could be, yeah.
Pretty sweet Hummer parked in the driveway.
That yours?
Yeah, that's mine.
It's a lease.
Got a great deal on it.
It's very sweet.
They say Arnold Schwarzenegger's the reason that Hummers exist.
- Don't know how, but that's what they say.
- No kidding?
Huh.
What kind of work do you do, Mr. Wormald?
I work IT for a pharmaceutical company.
Wow, computers.
God, I should've gotten into computers.
- I'd have that same Hummer.
- Right.
Look, guys, I'm glad you like my car but I think we're looking through the wrong end of the telescope here.
- The priority is my baseball cards.
- Of course.
Yes, now, I have a detailed manifest of my entire collection and asterisks next to the high-ticket items.
It's clear which ones they'll try to fence first because they're super, super valuable.
So you're gonna wanna get this list out to pawn shops, collectors.
Question anyone who's done any sort of crime like this in the past.
You know, the usual suspects.
Can I get you the list so you can start investigating?
- Yeah, if you could get us that list...
- Okay, I'll print it out.
Hank Aaron, mint.
God, my signed Derek Jeter.
Willy Mays, O-Pee-Chee.
Gotta breathe.
Just keep breathing, keep breathing.
- Okay.
- I know, right?
OFFICER 1:
Left the TV...
- Uh-huh.
- ...
left the computer.
- Right.
Huh.
There's something wrong with this picture.

You don't listen.
Yeah, it's me again.

He's dripping in Gucci.
It's like I'm at the watering hole and I'm watching the fattest, slowest water buffalo expose his neck to me, and I'm the lioness ready to strike.
[CHUCKLES]
Come, Kim, join me.
Join the pride.
I said "lioness" because it's the females who do all the hunting.
I just wanted to be species-accurate irrespective of my own sex, it's a National Geographic thing.
Anyway get out here.

There are a few options on the company cars.
We can arrange a test drive whenever you'd like.
Company car, wow.
And there's a service that will deliver it right to you, wherever you want.
And if you find you're not happy with it, it's not a big deal to change it out.
That sounds really, uh...
Yeah.
This is interesting.
Oh, if this isn't to your taste we have a collection of art in-house you can choose from.
Any time you're ready, I can put together some samples for you to review.
I...
I...
I like this.
Good.
Well, any other needs you have, I'm here to help.
Office supplies, dietary needs.
Anything special you want stocked in the fridge?
Maybe a humidifier?
- Gets kind of dry in here.
- Omar, I'm pretty low maintenance.
Sure.
Well, if there's anything you need, I'm right outside the door.
- Great.
If I think of anything.
- Okay.
Hey, do you think...?
I'm just looking at this.
Do we get a choice of desks?
What were you thinking?
Is it possible...?
Can we do a cocobolo?
Cocobolo desk?
Absolutely.
I'll get right on that.

Why were you working against me?
You're not a real lawyer!
Now that I'm doing the job alone, I get the full 1500.
I can get more pills.
If you're gonna be a criminal, do your homework.
Thanks for not heading to the Bahamas with this.
- What are you doing?
- "The right thing."
Whatever it was, did you get it out of your system?
Yep, all gone.
The Sandpiper case?
It's getting too big for HHM.

Oh, great.
Jimmy, right on time.
Good to see you.
Hello, Howard.
Hey.
Hi.
James McGill, Clifford Main.
Just "Jimmy." And it's a pleasure to meet you, Clifford.
Likewise.
We know all about your work on Sandpiper.
Well, it's a group effort.
I mean, the folks at HHM are just knocking it out of the park.
Well, you know, the case wouldn't exist without you.
Absolutely.
Once you get him on your team, you'll know why I call him "Charlie Hustle."
Jimmy, these are my associates...
Brian Archuleta and Erin Brill.
- Nice to meet you both.
- It's great to meet you.
I hate to do this, but, um, could I borrow Ms. Wexler for a moment?
If you will excuse us?
Pardon me.
What's going on?
I just, um
Listen, here's the thing.
If I take this job, does that mean the two of us...
I mean, uh...
Does it mean, uh...
What?
What...
What the hell is this?
If I take this job today, with Davis and Main does that mean that you and me...
Is this...
Is this gonna happen?
Jimmy, I...
I...
One thing has absolutely nothing to do with the other.
Nothing at all.
No.
Of course not.
Why would it?
Great.
Uh, sorry about that.
Listen, I just want to say thank you, sincerely,
For your interest in me.
It's an honor to be considered,
But at this time...
At this time...
Um, I'm gonna have to take myself out of the running.
Thanks.
Thank you, Howard.
Uh, Jimmy?
Mike:
Well, that was quick.
No charge.
Help me out here.
Did I dream it,
Or did I have $1,600,000 on my desk in cash?
No one on god's green earth knew we had it.
We could've split it 50/50.
We could've gone home with $800,000... each!
Tax-free!
Your point being?
Why didn't we?
I remember you saying something about doing the right thing.
You want to know why I didn't take that money?
Is that what you're asking?
Yeah, that's what I'm asking.
Me, personally, I was hired to do a job.
I did it.
That's as far as it goes.
Yeah.
Well, I know what stopped me.
And you know what?
It's never stopping me again.

Mrs. Nguyen, it's a beautiful day out there.
You should get out of this place once in a while.
You know, throw a frisbee, have some fun.
I have a business to run.
Uh, no.
The business is running you.
Listen to me.
You'll thank me later.

Hey!
It's me!
Geez.
Hello?
Hello?
It's me.
I got a new car.
You like it?
We're not taking that to the meet.
How are we gonna get there?
I'll drive.
My car.
Why?
This business requires restraint.
That is the opposite of restraint.
But...
I like it.
I mean, I'm proud of it.
Good.
Then you be proud of it on your own time, but not with me.
I'm not getting in that.
Okay.
Then... then don't.
Honestly, uh, you don't really do anything.
I've been paying you the salary of three people to just stand behind me.
You know?
And...
And these...
these last few deals...
This Nacho fella, he's been coming alone.
I mean, if he doesn't need backup men, then, I mean, why do I need you?
I should just go alone.
I'm throwing...
I'm throwing away money.
Just tossing it away.
Into the trash.
Look, you do whatever you want, but I'm advising you...
do not go to that meet without someone watching your back.
Yeah, well, of course you're gonna say that.
I mean, you don't want to be out of this easy-peasy job.
Well, I'm sorry, but this is the gravy train, and it's leaving the station right now.
So last chance.
All aboard.
Seriously, last chance.
I'm gonna count to, say, 10, and then I'm...
All right, then.
Your services are no longer needed!
Hola.
No old guy?
What, did he break a hip or something?
I know, right?
Yeah, no, we, uh...
We... we parted ways.
Yeah, saw things differently.
So...
You know how it is.
This is interesting.
Oh, yeah.
You like it?
Can I take a look?
Oh.
Be my guest.
Get in.
Check it out.
Wow.
Impressive.
Thank you.
Get in.
Feel the leather.
Yeah, it's a H2.
Brand-new off the line.
Slimmer than the H1 but longer, more height.
Yeah, it's a honey.
V-8 engine, 325 horsepower, tri-zone climate controls.
So you can have a girl in a bikini and another in a parka, and they're both gonna be comfortable.
You're running around with two girls in your S.U.V., you'd be really comfortable, huh?
Oh, yeah.
Yes.
I'm gonna count this quick.
Do your thing.
Make sure it's right.
Okeydokey.
We are good.
Uh, same as before.
Uh, still factory-sealed.
And, as always, you're welcome to count them.
I trust you.
Great.
Thank you.
See you next time.
Hello?
Yes.
Uh, no.
Sorry.
But...
Yes, this is James McGill, but I'm no longer a lawyer, so...
That's right... not a lawyer.
Bye.
So, this is what a midlife crisis looks like?
Not midlife crisis.
Clarity.
Midlife clarity.
Clarity?
Huh.
Clearly explain to me why you walked out on the best job opportunity of your life.
Get in the pool, and I'll tell ya.
Get in the pool?
Yeah.
Come on.
Just pop in the gift shop and buy a bathing suit... get a one-piece, nothing fancy.
The water is perfect.
It's 82 degrees.
You can order a drink.
And you got to try this crab dip.
Why are you acting like this?
I'm not acting like anything.
I just... finally decided to be me.
Everything okay, Mr. Cumpston?
Would you like another drink?
Uh, I'm good with this.
I'll tell you what, Mr. Cumpston.
If you really want to talk, I'll be in the bar.
Not for long.
Hey, Rolando.
Check.
What do...
What do you mean "quit the law"?
I quit it.
Simple as that.
Oh, well, thanks for explaining, Jimmy.
- It's super-clear now.
- Hey, buddy?
Uh, is that a misprint right there?
It's got to be, right?
- The Zafiro Anejo?
- Yeah.
That's correct, actually, believe it or not.
Holy shit.
A $50 shot of tequila?
Is it worth it?
Apparently.
I mean, it's kind of a personal-choice kind of thing.
Well, I can't die without trying a $50 shot of tequila, so, uh... two... dos... neat.
And, uh, we can charge that to the room, can't we?
No, we can't.
We...
I am paying.
And he will be having a shot of your well brand, and I'll have a glass of your house red.
We have a Cabernet, a Pinot, and a Syrah.
Whatever.
Dealer's choice.
Something with alcohol.
You got it.
Jimmy... did something happen in Cicero?
Why did something have to happen in Cicero?
Because when I talked to you about Davis Main, you were ready to take the job.
Now you're back, and you're suddenly quitting the law, cheating hotels out of expensive liquor, wearing a weird pinkie ring?
What, are you in the Mafia now?
Asking if we have a future.
I mean, where did that come from?
I don't know.
I just...
Well, Cicero has nothing to do with it.
It's my whole life.
Well, my life since Chuck made me come to Albuquerque.
Ever since I got here, all I've done is try to make Chuck happy, bend over backwards to please Chuck.
Chuck, Chuck, Chuck.
Well, no more.
You quitting the law... isn't that exactly what Chuck wants?
Who cares?
This is for me, okay?
I-I got into the law for all the wrong reasons.
I'm trusting my instincts.
I think that my talents are better spent elsewhere.
Where?
Floating in somebody else's pool?
Jimmy, you're a great lawyer.
Why give that up?
I'm not saying it didn't have its moments, but the stuff I liked about it...
selling people, convincing people...
I don't have to be a lawyer to do that.
Besides, people tell me how they see me, and it's not as a lawyer.
All right.
Here you go.
Thank you.
Lemme know if I can get you guys anything else, okay?
Bobby, what up, brother man?
Oh, thanks.
Short it.
Short it.
Short it.
Short that shit.
That stock is useless.
It's got no legs.
It's like a circus freak minus the fun.
And that one's even worse.
Who's giving you these?
Please do me a favor.
Take a pillow, put it over that stock's face until you hear the deathbed queef.
- It's a loser.
- Okay, so... if you're not gonna be a lawyer, then what?
Float around and wait for your Sandpiper money to roll in?
No.
That could take years.
Sandpiper has no bearing on this at all.
Yeah, it's got legs.
Okay, then, what's the plan?
To be open to the universe.
Okay, so no plan.
Just walk the Earth, like Jules at the end of "Pulp Fiction"?
Look, whatever the universe presents, whatever opportunity arises, I will take it.
- Whatever opportunity?
- Yeah.
Wasn't Davis Main an opportunity?
It's a great opportunity, and you're walking away from it.
Not him, not the guy who...
Look, shouldn't you at least try the job before you say no?
And waste everyone's time, including my own?
Kim, I appreciate your concern, but it's not for me.
I don't want it.
Jimmy, do you remember how long you studied for that bar?
How hard you worked?
All that effort, you're just gonna toss it away?
That's the Sunk Cost Fallacy.
W...
The what?
The Fallacy of Sunk Cost...
It's what gamblers do.
They throw good money after bad thinking they can turn their luck around.
It's like, "I've already spent this much money or time... whatever.
I got to keep going!"
No, there's no reward at the end of this game.
You are making a mistake.
I know you're making a mistake.
I've been doing the "right" thing for all these years now, and where has it gotten me?
Nowhere.
I'm sorry.
I don't...
It's not my thing.
I don't get it.
- I just don't get it.
- It's what's right for me.
Donkey balls.
Pure donkey balls, dude.
Wall Street's for suckers.
Who needs that aggravation?
If the the Oracle doesn't have to live there, then I sure as hell don't.
I can make a million-dollar stock trade on my laptop sitting on a toilet.
Like Midas, shitting gold bricks on my throne.
That's why Speigelman and Deitch want my business so bad.
I'm a golden God.
Look, of course I remember that.
Who forgets a thing like that?
That fart had the anger of a repressed minority community.
You fart like that in someone's face, you're gonna give them pinkeye for life.
Good convo, bro.
Till next time, brutha-man.
- Flip side.
On it.
- Come with me.
- What?
- Just come on.
Trust me.
What are you gonna do?
You want to understand what I'm talking about?
Follow my lead.
Hey, buddy, could you settle a bet for us?
- I what?
- Uh, sorry.
I don't want to make it sound like I was eavesdropping, but I kind of was.
Uh, we heard you talking about stocks.
Uh-huh.
Yeah, so, question... if you could settle a debate between me and my sister.
Uh, you know what?
We probably shouldn't be bothering this...
We wouldn't normally do this...
Right?
But we need an expert.
This guy sounds like he knows his stuff.
Yeah, go.
Okay.
Here's the question.
Uh, when it comes to the stock market, is there, like, a financial limit to how much a person's allowed to invest?
A limit?
No.
No limit.
Knew it.
Oh, even if it's an inheritance?
You know, with, like, inheritance taxes and whatnot?
Nope.
Same.
That's...
Oh, fantastic.
Thank you, buddy.
See?
No limit.
Told you we could invest it all.
And it's a smart move, too.
Sticking it all in the bank?
No.
Um, yeah.
You can... invest all your money.
Just make sure you diversify.
Yeah.
Diversify.
That's...
You got to...
Oh, hey, um...
What do you mean, "diversify"?
Well, diversify is...
Y-You know that saying,
"Don't put all your eggs in one basket," right?
Same principle.
No, it makes complete sense.
Thank you.
Now, if I had an idea of the money we're talking about...
Ballpark...
I could give you examples of smart diversification.
Yeah, um...
Look, an uncle on our father's side recently passed, and he left us somewhere in the neighborhood of $1.4 million.
And I don't mean to be greedy, but I think, if we invest it smart now, we could double it, triple it... we could quadruple the whole inheritance, right?
In my opinion?
Fortune favors the bold, man.
Now, if you guys are free to join me for a drink,
I can give you a quick consult.
That's all right.
We were gonna do it ourselves through one of those online brokerage websites.
We're just gonna pick, uh, a classic, like...
I think they're called blue-chip stocks?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you can totally do it yourself.
Shoot for the tried and true.
'Course, you might be putting your cash in the Hindenburg, the Andrea Doria, uh..."Corky Romano."
Right?
They all seemed rock-solid beforehand, but then...
Yeah, not good.
Not good, yeah.
So, how do you know?
Well, that's where someone like myself comes in.
Proven track record as a wealth manager.
I take calculated but aggressive risks 'cause I want to catch lightning.
And I do.
Practically a money-printing machine.
That sounds good.
A money-printing machine.
Listen, there's a little booth over here.
There's some privacy.
We can talk.
No obligations.
We can just... just rap about this a little bit.
- Yeah, I guess.
- Yeah?
What do you say, sis?
Can we just talk?
Electric slide on in there.
And we'll just rap a little bit.
It's no...
My name's Ken, by the way.
Uh, Viktor, with a "K."
Cool.
Viktor with a "K."
And this lovely lady is?
It's...
Giselle.
Giselle Saint Claire.
Ah, lovely.
Please, sit.
I won't bite.
So, Viktor with a "K" and Giselle... exotic names.
They're Dutch.
Well, Boer, to be precise.
Our... father's side of the family is from South Africa, which is where uncle Humphrey passed away.
South Africa.
They grow them beautiful down there, right?
Charlize Theron.
And you.
Oh.
Well...
I've never actually been, but hope to go someday.
Tell you what, by the time I'm done with you two, you might be taking your own private jet.
Nice.
Excuse me.
Hi.
Uh, we are sitting here now, so, uh, we could use a wine list, if you get a chance...
Hey, uh, are a tequila fan?
Yes.
You down for that?
You ever try Zafiro Anejo?
No, I have not, but I'm down for whatever.
Three of whatever she just said.
- You got it.
- All right.
So, stock market.
A great investment.
And you're picking the right time to jump in.
Why do you listen to me?
I'm an idiot.
And talks about his cars, talks about...
- How many cars did he have?
- I don't think...
- It doesn't make sense.
- That's it, Ken.
Oh, yeah.
Compliments of the bartender.
She thought you might want a souvenir.
Oh, my God.
Did we drink the entire bottle?
Not yet, we didn't.
- Boom.
- Hey, hey, cheers.
Uh, I think we're ready for the check.
No, really, it's the smart way to go.
Okay.
But, so, to be clear, you take the money directly from our account and invest it.
- Diversify.
- Diversify it.
And then all the dividends and all the profits and the...what-have-you comes back into our account.
Boom.
Absolutely.
And you'll get a detailed statement showing you how much your money is growing... biggest bulls of the month, et cetera.
Ken, buddy...
let's do this.
Great.
Right there, Viktor with a "K,"
and, Giselle, you are next.
- This is so exciting.
- Mm-hmm.
Folks, it's been a pleasure.
- Oops, I got that.
- Can't let you do it, son.
Wait.
What?
Ken, you are the greatest.
Thank you.
- No problem-o.
Hey, this will be the best decision you'll ever make.
Oh, I believe it.
All right, well, we should get out of your hair.
- Yeah.
- Oh, wait, wait.
This... is for you.
Now, that's got all my contact info.
Call me anytime with questions or anything at all.
Ken.
Bye.
Call me, guys.
- Bye.
- Try and stop us.
Wow.
Just wow.
Hey.
What I...
Is this right?
Yes, sir, it is.
Go, go, go, go, go!
- Zafiro Anejo!
- Shh!
He's gonna come out.
Oh, no.
I didn't read the fine print.
- Wait.
- Yeah!
Holy crap.
I can't b...
Can I borrow that when you're done?
No, that's gross.
H-how is it gross?
Our germs have already intermingled.
It's my toothbrush.
It's different.
Why is it different?
Because.
You know, gums bleed, and there's... there's cold sores, all sorts of food and weir...
Let me see that.
Come on.
What?
No!
Come on!
I'll do it right now.
- I don't care.
- I need to brush my teeth.
I don't have an extra.
It's not my problem.
That's fine.
I got this.
Good.
I'm fine with this.
Yeah, me too.
Wait till you see what I floss with.
That's a keeper.
Thank you, Viktor with a "K."
Hey, wouldn't it be great if we could do that every night?
Yes, it would.
But...
We can't.
I know, yeah.
But I'm just saying, if we could, it would be great.
But I know we can't.
Oh, crap.
I can't be late today.
Howard is doling out assignments, and the last one through the door could get stuck in doc review.
You got somewhere to go?
Yeah.
Uh, yeah, I got somewhere.
You good?
Yeah.
All good.
Daniel Wormald?
I'm Officer Baker.
This is Officer Saxton.
Yeah, please.
Come on in.
Come in.
It's over here.
See what they did?
I mean, all gone.
All of them, just...
Uh, what's all gone?
I have...
I had a baseball-card collection... a major collection...
All stolen.
Oh, sorry to hear that.
Uh, was it common knowledge that you have baseball cards?
No, not really.
So, nobody in particular you can think of wanting them?
No.
Not that I...
No.
How'd they get in?
Uh, the back door over here.
It was open when I came home for lunch.
I mean, it was locked, but they must have jimmied it open or something.
Uh-huh.
At what time, uh, you figure this happened?
I left for work at 8:15, came home for lunch at 12:30, and called you immediately.
Was anything else taken?
Cash... a fair bit.
Uh, um...
How much cash?
Uh, I don't know.
You know, let's focus on what's important here, you know?
All I really care about are my baseball cards.
You know, I have a Topps Mickey Mantle rookie card that's irreplaceable.
It's a mint, 60/40, 90/10 on the reverse.
I can go on.
All my cards are in top-loaders, but if they're taken out and exposed to the elements,
I mean, or creased, God forbid,
I mean, you're looking at a 9-point downgrade in a matter of seconds.
I understand the first 48 hours are the most important in investigations like this, so the more time passes,
I mean, the less likely we are of a recovery.
So...time is of the essence here, guys.
Well, we're gonna help you out the best we can, Mr. Wormald.
Good.
Well...they really tossed this place.
I mean, are you sure they weren't looking for anything else?
Like what?
I don't know.
J-Just wondering your thoughts.
I assume more baseball cards.
Did you have more baseball cards than the ones you keep locked in that case here?
Yes, in... in back... thousands.
But these were the crown jewels over here.
You know, t-the all-star lineup.
Right.
Hmm.
What?
Just trying to make sense of it.
What's to make sense of?
I mean, isn't it as simple as the perp was looking for more baseball cards?
Or hopped up on speed or whatever and went nuts with the vandalism?
Yeah.
I mean, that could be.
Yeah.
Pretty sweet Hummer parked in the driveway.
That yours?
Yeah, that's mine.
Uh, it's a lease.
Got a great deal on it.
It's very sweet.
You know, they say Arnold Schwarzenegger is the reason that Hummers exist.
I don't know how, but that's what they say.
- No kidding.
- Yeah.
Huh.
What kind of work do you do, Mr. Wormald?
Uh, I work I.T., uh, for a pharmaceutical company.
Wow.
Computers.
God, I should've gotten into computers.
- I'd have that same Hummer.
- Yeah, right.
Look, guys, I'm glad you like my car, but I think we're looking through the wrong end of the telescope here.
You know, the priority is my baseball cards.
Of course.
Yes, now, I have a detailed manifest of my entire collection and asterisks next to the high-ticket items, so it's clear which ones they're gonna try to fence first, 'cause they're super, super valuable.
So you're gonna want to get this list out to pawnshops, uh, collectors, question anyone who's done any sort of crime like this in the past.
You know, the... the usual suspects.
Uh, can I get you the list so you can start investigating?
Yeah, you...
Yeah, if you could get us that list...
Okay, I'll...
I'll print it out.
Hank Aaron, mint.
God, my signed Derek Jeter.
Willie Mays, O-Pee-Chee.
Got to breathe.
Just keep breathing.
Keep breathing.
- Okay.
- I know, right?
Left the TV.
- Uh-huh.
- Left the computer.
- Right.
Huh.
There's something wrong with this picture.
Hey, it's me.
Another perfect day in paradise out here.
I'm in the pool.
Okay, call me.
- Hi!
How are you?
- Hey, babe.
Did you get lunch?
I did.
You know, I think I'm burning up back here.
Oh, really?
Well, you're just in luck.
- Look what I have.
- Oh, hey, great.
Oh, yeah, you're all red back here.
Yeah.
That feels good, babe.
I told you not to spend so much time in the sun.
You don't listen.
Yeah, it's me again.
Listen, as I speak, not 25 feet away from me,
I'm looking at the mark.
Think Thurston Howell III if he shacked up with Ginger.
He's dripping in Gucci.
It's like I'm at the watering hole, and I'm watching the fattest, slowest water buffalo expose his neck to me, and I'm the lioness ready to strike.
Come, Kim.
Join me.
Join the pride.
Um, I said "lioness"
because it's the females who do all the hunting.
Uh, just wanted to be species-accurate, irrespective of my own sex.
It's a National Geographic thing.
Anyway...
Get out here.
Bye.
Santa Fe, New Mexico.
I need the number of a law firm...
Davis Main.
Yeah, you can connect me.
Davis Main.
There are a few options on the company cars.
We can arrange a test-drive whenever you'd like.
Company car... wow.
And there's a service that will deliver it right to you, wherever you want.
And if you find you're not happy with it, it's not a big deal to change it out.
That sounds really, uh...
Yeah.
This is, uh, interesting.
Oh, if, uh...
If this isn't to your taste, we have a collection of art in-house you can, uh, choose from.
Anytime you're ready,
I can put together some samples for you to review.
I...
I...
No, I like this.
Good.
Uh, well, any other needs you have, I'm here to help.
Office supplies, dietary needs...
Anything special you want stocked in the fridge?
Uh, maybe a humidifier?
Gets kind of dry in here.
Omar, I...
I'm pretty low-maintenance.
Sure.
Well, if there's anything you need,
I'm right outside the door.
Great.
If I think of anything.
Good.
Hey, do you think, um...
I'm just looking at this.
D-Do we get a choice of desks?
What were you thinking?
Um... is it possible, um...
Can we do... cocobolo?
Cocobolo desk?
Absolutely.
I'll get right on that.
_
In the criminal justice system, sexually based offenses are considered especially heinous.
In New York City, the dedicated detectives who investigate these vicious felonies are members of an elite squad known as the Special Victims Unit.
These are their stories.
Well, thank you so much for meeting me for lunch.
I've been going stir-crazy on maternity leave.
- How's being a mom?
- You were right.
It's the greatest thing ever.
- See, I told you.
- Yeah.
- You getting any sleep?
- No!
Look at me.
I was up till 4:00 a.m. last night.
- What is she, six weeks?
- Mm.
You gotta Ferberize her soon.
No, really, listen.
You gotta call my sister.
It's like two or three nights where the baby
- basically cries non-stop.
- Yeah.
But then they start to self-soothe.
Okay, then you come over and do it.
Oh, see?
Here we go.
No, I got this, I got this.
It's okay.
Hey, hey, come on.
Come on, that's a good girl, Jesse.
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Shh.
You see?
The secret is, you gotta bounce from your knees.
They love that.
Shh, shh, shh, shh... shh, shh, shh...
Ah... ah... ahh!
Hurry up, Travis.
You don't want to be late.
Can you, uh, write me a note?
You missed lunch.
Saved you some.
No need.
I already ate out.
What're you smiling at, Zach?
Oh, nothing.
Travis, Jordan.
There's still two more hours till winter break.
Yeah, get to class, or you're benched.
Zach, I expect more from you if you're gonna earn a slot.
Towel boy's never getting a slot.
On any team.
Oscar Wilde was a man of many secrets, and those secrets influenced his writing.
So you're going to finish "The Picture of Dorian Gray"
for your first quiz back in January.
Now, I know you'll be on vacation, but I expect a report of a novel of your choice from each of you when you get back.
Happy holidays.
See you.
Bye, Becka.
Have fun on the slopes.
Happy holidays.
Hey, see you, Anna.
Have fun.
Be safe.
Happy winter break, boys.
Have a good vacation, Ms. Burnap.
Oh, I will.
Oh, Jordan.
Before you go, can I get a little help?
Now?
Well, I need a ream of paper from the supply closet, and it's on a high shelf.
Yeah.
Stop, stop.
Playing hard to get?
Is that better?
Now let's see what we can do to get that average up.
_
_
Dad?
It's me.
Look, Mom's on the warpath about your girlfriend again.
So it might be a better holiday if you just ignore her when she calls.
Talk to you later.
_
- You lost?
- What?
Uh, no.
- Just waiting for a friend.
- Call him.
Kids come here to buy drugs sometimes and end up in jail.
Safe home.
Performance reviews?
Okay.
It's just part of my duties as sergeant.
We've been running up overtime.
I think we can work more efficiently.
And you have some ideas about that?
Yeah.
Take Carisi.
He's studying for the bar, trailing Barba.
I'm not so sure his focus is here.
He's learning the law.
He's becoming a better cop.
And Rollins...
is she really coming back?
I mean, we both saw her with her baby.
Seems like motherhood is her priority.
You can be a good mother and good at your job, too, Dodds.
Of course.
It's just, uh...
I think you need someone here who's all about the job.
I've got you and I've got Fin.
Me?
I'm still getting up to speed.
And Fin...
Don't underestimate him.
He knows more than anyone here.
He does.
It's just that...
He's a kicker.
He boots any call he can to someone else.
That's not true.
Sorry to interrupt.
We got a call about a missing 15-year-old boy.
- For how long?
- Over 48 hours.
Their local precinct wants us to take a look at it.
Okay.
Better safe than sorry.
That's why I figured Sarge and Carisi
- might want to check it out.
- Uh, why not you?
Well, I've been racking up a lot of overtime lately, so...
Yeah, well, I'll approve it.
Go with Dodds.
_
Zach told me he went skiing.
Cole has a timeshare in Vail.
He's always buying the kid's love.
- Cole is Zach's dad?
- Yes, we're divorced.
Zach said his father bought him a ticket, but he never texted me when he landed.
Then Cole didn't answer my calls.
So Cole had no contact with Zach, either?
No.
When he finally answered his cell, he said he'd just flown in on a red-eye with his girlfriend.
He's a pilot, she's his third flight attendant.
Did you see Zach leave?
Did he pack a bag?
His duffel bag is gone.
And his toothbrush.
Did he have a laptop or an iPad?
- It would be on his desk.
- It's not here.
Why are you bombarding me with questions?
Shouldn't you be checking every hospital, every morgue?
We're getting to that, ma'am.
Don't patronize me.
That is what Cole does.
He thinks I'm overreacting.
You are.
- Oh, now you get here!
- This is ridiculous, Serena.
Why would I take Zach over Christmas?
It's the busiest travel time of the year.
You took him last year!
Oh, wait, before you had the girlfriend.
Seriously?
Mr. and Mrs. Foster, your son is missing.
Right.
Sorry.
We'll take all the information that you can give us.
We'll try and track his cell phone.
I already tried.
I have a locator on it.
His phone's either off or it's dead.
- You track his phone?
- We share a cloud ID.
You can check his messages?
Oh, right, yeah.
I can.
Um, I set it up when I bought the phone for safety.
You had that and you didn't check?
I turned off the notifications like a year ago.
You have any idea how many texts kids send?
Okay.
There's, like, dozens of them here.
Um...
What's this?
Looks like he's sexting a girl.
That's more like a woman.
"I'll teach you so many things.
You'll be my favorite student."
Ugh.
So what is this... some woman took my son?
May I see that a minute?
"Take the LIRR to Jamaica Station.
"Meet me at the base of the AirTrain entrance.
Bring your passport.
Let's fly away."
Well...
He must've gone willingly.
I mean, look at her.
It doesn't matter.
He's 15.
She's not.
The last texts are about going to the AirTrain.
Others were more explicit, accompanied by pictures.
And we tracked Zach's phone?
Yeah, it died at Jamaica Station.
And I traced the cell the pics came from.
It's a burner.
It only sent texts to Zach, then it goes off the grid.
But I'm still going through the older texts.
Whoever this woman is, she knew exactly what she was doing.
Never shows her face.
No identifying marks or tattoos.
The texts indicate that she's older, that she knew him from school.
It's gotta be a teacher from River Park Charter High.
Okay.
We flag his passport?
First thing.
Then I checked TSA.
Zach never made it to the airport.
So talk to MTA, see if we can get security footage from Jamaica Station.
Anything else?
Yeah.
In an earlier text, she mentions the names Travis and Jordan.
Says that if Zach wants extra credit, he should ask them about it.
Okay, so classmates.
Track them down.
Won't be easy.
School's closed for winter break.
Somebody's gotta be around.
Start with the principal.
_
My father would have a cow if he saw Santa sagging on his lawn like that.
Try knocking again.
Okay, okay, I'm coming.
How much I owe you?
Actually, we're NYPD.
Oh, that's how I know you guys.
Are you Mr. Bernstein?
Principal of River Park Charter High School?
Yeah, but I'm on vacation.
Why don't you go call the pizza place, see what's taking so long?
I'm kind of busy right now.
- Can it wait?
- Afraid not.
We're searching for a missing student.
- Zach Foster.
- Zach?
He's a good kid.
Is he in trouble?
Well, we're not sure.
We got reason to believe he's with this woman.
You have any teachers who look like that?
There's been a lot of turnover in education the last few years.
- Most of my teachers are young.
- Yeah, I'll bet.
So let's rule out the older ones, the men, anybody 50 pounds heavier.
We'll start from there.
She may already be involved with two other students.
She told Zach to talk to Travis and Jordan.
- No last names?
- Mmm.
Travis and Jordan...
There's a few of each, but, uh, maybe Travis Barstow and Jordan Massina?
They're both on the wrestling team.
Zach's the equipment manager.
I don't know who that is.
She told Zach Foster to ask you about extra credit.
Zach?
No way.
Well, he's missing, maybe with her, and he could be in danger.
Yeah, in danger of getting laid.
This is no joke.
You cover for her, you're an accessory to statutory rape.
Look, we have the sexts, and we think that she sent the same ones to Zach that she sent to you.
Zach's still waiting on puberty.
She wouldn't go for him.
He's dreaming.
She likes guys with muscle.
Like you?
It's not like that.
Well, what's it like, then?
I didn't want to.
I had to.
My grades were slipping.
I would have gotten kicked off the wrestling team.
Who is she?
Ms. Burnap.
Phoebe's her first name.
She's our English teacher.
She makes me do things to her in the supply closet.
That's how I got the perfect grade on my "Leaves of Grass" essay.
Phoebe Burnap, 27.
She's been at River Park for the last year and a half.
But before that, three different schools... four years.
- Fired?
- No, she quit each time.
But when I called former administrators, two admitted that they'd heard rumors.
And they did nothing?
They said rumors always follow young, pretty teachers.
Boys talk.
Hot for teacher.
Happens everywhere.
Right, but when the teacher follows through...
That's rape.
Jordan and Travis confirmed that the sexts came from her.
But why would she use her own cell on them and a burner on Zach?
I mean, why the change in pattern?
Maybe she's learning.
Or she wants to take it to the next level with Zach.
Either way, we know who he's with.
The question is, where are they?
Well, last known whereabouts got him heading east from Jamaica Station Friday night.
So widen the scope.
See if the teacher turns up on any security cameras outside the station.
Start a canvass.
No need to.
I ran her credit cards.
She put a deposit down on a Vermont ski lodge, and she bought gas up near there Saturday morning.
How far north?
_
Front desk confirms Phoebe Burnap's in room 212
- with a young male.
- Great.
Let's move.
They request that we spare the door.
- NYPD.
Nobody move.
- What the hell?
- What's going on?
- Get out!
- Where's Zach?
- Wh... who?
- How old are you?
- He's 21... he's my husband.
Your husband?
Yes.
We eloped Friday night.
All right, how about we lose the cuffs, get dressed.
Phoebe Burnap, you're under arrest.
That's you.
We got confirmation from the two other boys you sexted.
That's my picture, yes, but I don't know where Zach got it.
Check my phone;
they didn't come from me.
We know they came from a burner cell.
I'm not even sure what that is.
Listen, if you met up with Zach Foster, you need to tell us now.
We're pulling the video from the AirTrain entrance and we're gonna put the two of you together.
I wasn't with Zach.
Honestly, he's just a kid.
Oh, not your type?
Come on, Phoebe.
Your picture's on his phone.
You asked him to meet you.
- Where is he?
- I don't know.
My husband, David, is on Christmas break from Oberlin.
We decided to elope the night he came back.
That's why we were in Vermont.
We've been together the whole time.
Okay, well, you stick to that story, and you're gonna end up in jail and on the registry for a very long time.
Is that what you want?
- I want a lawyer.
- Fine.
But the longer it takes us to find Zach, the less likely you are to get a deal.
If something happens to Zach...
I didn't do anything.
I want a lawyer.
Someone must've hacked Phoebe's phone.
These are pictures she sent to me.
Not just you.
Three of her students...
Travis, Jordan, and Zach.
She would never do that.
I know this must be hard for you, but you understand our perspective here, right?
I mean, these photos, the information from the boys...
How long have you known your... wife?
We've known each other for years.
- For years?
You're 21.
- Yeah, we met in high school.
Senior year.
Your senior year?
Well, yeah.
Her first year teaching.
Six years is not a big difference.
If she were 21 and I was 27, it'd be fine, right?
We're not here to judge you.
We just need to know when and where you met Phoebe on Friday.
She picked me up at LaGuardia a little after 3:00.
We drove up to the ski lodge and got married at the base of the mountain at midnight as snow fell all around us.
"As the snow fell." Romantic.
Yeah, it was.
We were together the whole time.
She wore me out.
He could be lying, but I doubt it.
That kid's in love.
You can't trust someone like that.
Okay, the lodge confirms their check-in time, champagne delivery to the room, and a couple's massage.
It could be some elaborate alibi, but what was her plan?
Take a 15-year-old on her honeymoon?
She text Zach, sent him tickets.
There's gotta be some connection between them.
The first two boys are athletes.
She sexted them from her regular cell, did them in her car or in her school.
It's a long throw from that to a burner cell and kidnapping.
It is, but she is Zach's last contact.
So this David knows something.
Keep him talking.
Lieutenant Benson?
Counselor Roth.
On what charges are you holding Phoebe Burnap?
Rape in the third, possibly rape in the second, kidnapping, and sexual assault.
Rape?
A jury is going to look at her, look at him...
Do you think they'll see it that way?
My client and I will need a word.
Of course.
Look, we can't prove she took Zach, but we have her dead to rights on raping two other teenaged boys.
I'm aware.
But right now, Zach is missing, and he's the priority.
If she wants a deal, she'll get one.
Zach is a nice kid.
I would never do anything to hurt him.
Well, then tell us where he is.
I'd first like to make it clear that my client is admitting to nothing.
And, unless we get a proffer agreement, we're walking out the door.
You want queen for a day, you've got it.
We don't have time to hammer out the logistics now, but I'll work with you to see that your client gets a better deal than she deserves for raping two students.
Rape?
That's not...
Ms. Burnap, we're only discussing Zach right now.
- But...
- Our concern is finding him.
I never approached Zach.
I never texted him.
He's a good student.
There was never any need for tutoring.
Tutoring... is that what you're calling it?
I was looking out for those kids.
Yeah?
In the supply closet?
Jordan and Travis come from dysfunctional homes.
There were abuse issues.
I helped them through it.
Again, let's focus on Zach.
Quickly.
Okay.
My client was set up by someone, and we know who.
Hold on...
you know who Zach's with and you've waited all this time to tell us?
Let's not waste any more of it with recriminations.
Ms. Burnap?
Jordan came to me a month ago, upset.
He was having a hard time performing.
He was feeling inadequate.
I... reassured him that he wasn't, but he told me that he already talked about it with Donald Basinski, his wrestling coach.
This Coach Basinski knew about you and Jordan?
So you see,
Ms. Burnap is a victim here, too.
A victim?
Those photos were personal.
If Basinski used them, it was without my permission.
Used them, how?
To lure Zach to him?
He is a wrestling coach.
You hear a lot of rumors about those guys.
Yeah, okay.
I showed Coach Basinski the sexts and the photos.
He said he'd put an end to it.
He didn't want you to go to the principal or the police?
He said the press could catch wind of that,
I could lose my shot at a college scholarship.
Did you just show him the photos, or did you give them to him?
I AirDropped them.
He said he needed the proof.
Give us a minute, Jordan.
Uh, I...
I don't know what this is about, but Coach... he's a good guy.
He always has time for you, no matter what.
Jordan gave the Coach the pics, and he used them to catfish Zach.
He's our man.
Okay, so Ms. Burnap was telling the truth.
Which means there are two predators at the same school.
Well, it happens.
I'm assuming no luck reaching Coach.
His cell phone went straight to voicemail.
- TARU can't trace it.
- For what it's worth,
Donald Basinski's got a stellar resume.
He's been at River Park for 12 years.
He's five-time Coach of the Year.
And if he's a predator, this kid has no idea.
Right, because predators know who to pick on.
Where does this coach live?
- Floral Park.
- Go.
Now.
- We need a warrant, Counselor.
- I'll get you one, just go.
NYPD!
Go, go, go, go!
Clear!
Two plates, two beers.
They were here.
Kitchen's clear.
Basement.
I'm going down.
I got pictures of kids over here.
All these boys.
Who are they?
What the hell happened to them?
We'll worry about that later.
Right now, we gotta find Zach.
There's nothing on real estate searches or credit cards.
Wherever he's taking these kids, he's using cash.
APB on his car has him on the New Jersey Turnpike headed north late Friday night.
No signs since then.
No luck here, either.
Principal Bernstein's going through photos now.
Copy that, Lieutenant.
Well, those are our uniforms, so they're all River Park students.
Yeah, but do you recognize any of them?
Not really.
This is only my second year.
Are these all kids Phoebe Burnap seduced?
She got a thing for wrestlers?
Wrestling team have a training camp?
No.
We barely have enough money to get to the competitions.
Have you talked to Coach Basinski about these kids?
Can't reach him.
Coach mention any holiday plans to you?
Second home, maybe someplace upstate?
He's a wrestling junkie.
He's probably spending the break in a basement somewhere looking at scouting tapes.
Um...
I don't know where this was taken, but that kid's Enrique Familia.
Okay, how do we get in touch with him?
He was only here, like, six months.
Moved back to Colombia or something.
Okay.
He ever mention going anywhere with Coach Basinski, maybe to train?
Uh, he didn't speak much English.
Only came to practice for a few months, then just kind of disappeared.
Yeah.
- Uh, that's Sam Moreau.
- Is he in your grade?
He was a few years older.
Was?
He rammed his car into a tree last Christmas drunk.
Killed himself.
Zach just started managing the team this year.
Can't Coach Basinski help you with this?
We don't know where he is right now.
Why are you looking for him?
I don't understand...
you arrested Ms. Burnap.
We did.
But she wasn't involved with your son.
Coach Basinski is?
We don't know exactly.
That son of a bitch.
That's why he took an interest in him.
That's why he said he could be on the team next year!
And you wanted him to play sports.
- So this is my fault?
- Guys, guys...
This... this isn't helpful.
We need to find your son right now.
So I want to go over everything that he told you about Coach.
Zach reveres him.
He always says Coach is the only one who believes he can make the team.
Isn't that Nat?
- Nat who?
- Nat Phelps.
His sister, Sarah, used to babysit Zach.
Nat would come over and pick her up.
How can we find him?
_
Basinski?
I haven't talked to him in years.
When he was your coach, did you ever go on any out-of-town trips with him?
- Who told you that?
- Coach is missing.
We searched his house and found some pictures.
What kind of pictures?
Looks like you're in a rural area.
- You remember that?
- I don't know.
The team traveled for competitions.
- This could be anywhere.
- I don't think so.
Team probably didn't even go with you on this trip.
I don't know what you're talking about, and I gotta get back to work.
Hey, this isn't just about you, okay?
There's a missing boy.
We heard you know him.
Zach Foster?
Zach?
Last time I saw him, he was a little kid.
Yeah, we think Coach Basinski took him somewhere.
Now maybe you heard Coach talking about a cabin?
A fishing lodge?
Someplace he might go in the winter.
Coach had a place in Pennsylvania.
But I never went there.
He mention a road or a town?
If that's where Zach is, we're pretty sure he doesn't want to be there.
There was some kind of old-fashioned general store.
Coach used to bring back treats for the team... ice cream, chocolate pretzels, candy...
He said there was a Viking, some kind of sculpture in the parking lot.
He said that?
Yeah.
I never saw it, but that's what he said.
If it helps.
Thanks.
So have you seen this boy in the last few days?
He looks kind of familiar, I guess.
Yeah?
What about him?
Yeah, Coach B.
That's how I know that kid.
They were in over the weekend.
Oh, good, so he is with the coach.
You know, his parents have been worried about him.
He's not answering his cell.
There's literally no reception up here.
Like, one bar on a good day.
Oh, so annoying, right?
Listen, you know where we might be able to find them?
I know he fishes up at the reservoir.
He must have a cabin near there.
Hey, does Coach still have that same SUV?
- Mm-hmm.
- Good.
Thank you.
Thanks.
Coach B, how you doing?
Hi, Al, what's going on?
We're having some trouble with power lines down the road.
Just want to make sure your line is grounded.
Well, the line's outside the house.
You mind showing me?
Yeah, okay.
- Whoa, what's...
- Hey, NYPD.
Where's the boy?
- Who?
- Where's the boy?
Take him to the car.
Zach!
Zach?
Okay, you take that room, and I'll take this one.
On it.
He's here!
Zach...
Zach.
He's breathing.
We need an ambulance!
Oh, Zach.
Zach...
It's okay... it's okay.
How's Zach doing?
There was alcohol and Rohypnol in his system.
No sign of external injuries.
- Okay, you did a rape kit?
- He refused it.
He's conscious now, asking for his parents.
Did you get a statement from Zach?
He's receiving treatment.
We're just about to go in there.
How're the parents doing?
They argued in the backseat all the way up here.
How is he?
I wanna see Zach.
Can we see him?
- Yes, of course.
- Follow me.
Is Basinski with the state troopers?
Yeah, they processed him so that we can extradite.
Look...
Fin, Dodds, head over.
We're gonna go talk to the boy.
This guy has been coming up to his family cabin for years.
And none of us had a clue.
That's how they get away with it.
How's Zach doing?
You know, before I saw him, he was really having a tough Christmas.
That's how this is gonna go?
What're you talking about?
Don't even try, Basinski.
We know you catfished the boy.
What?
What does that mean?
Look, never mind.
This is what really happened.
He comes from a broken home.
And neither of his folks wanted him over the holidays, so he ran away.
And if I hadn't stumbled upon him,
God knows what could have happened.
You drugged him.
I fed him.
Okay, I gave him a beer, too.
I wanted him to feel like a man.
He has no friends, no life.
You know how to pick 'em.
What, the ones who need help?
Yeah.
I do.
Do you guys even hear yourselves?
I gave him a home on the team.
I taught him how to wrestle.
He was grooming him.
Look, okay...
You're prejudiced, aren't you?
Your mind's already made up, but... but you know what I'm talking about.
Sports are good for young men.
Keeps them busy.
Channels that energy.
I bet you played football, huh?
Or boxed.
Don't change the subject.
We found Zach in that cabin.
Whatever you did to him, he was terrified.
The way you guys came through the door, I'm not surprised.
You scared him half to death.
You know what, shut up!
Stand up.
We're done, come on.
All right, all right, so look at my record!
- Come on!
- Coach of the Year!
16 years, no one's ever accused me of anything.
Coach B is a stand-up guy.
You ask any of my kids.
Yeah, we already started.
Good!
Then I'd like to exercise my right to counsel.
My mom and dad said I can go home.
Can't we do this later?
Yeah, but, uh, Zach, sometimes it's better to talk this through right away.
Now we understand that you thought that you were meeting
Ms. Burnap, but Coach Basinski showed up.
- Is that correct?
- Yeah.
He said he'd just happened to be driving by.
He offered me a ride home.
So you got in the car.
And, uh... and then what?
He drove me to his house.
He ordered pizza.
He gave me a beer.
We watched hockey.
I must've drank too much.
I don't really drink, all right?
So it must've made me pass out.
And then what happened?
That... that you remember?
I was in his car.
On a highway at night.
Look, he told me he was driving me home.
So I fell back asleep.
When I woke up, I was in that cabin.
The doors were locked.
And where was Coach?
He was in bed with me.
Listen, I know this is tough, Zach.
But was he touching you?
I woke up... because his mouth...
It wasn't your fault.
His mouth was on me.
And I wasn't into it, all right?
I'm not gay.
I-I watch porn.
I do.
And I'm talking about normal stuff.
- Girls.
- Zach, listen to me.
It means nothing.
It doesn't mean anything.
You were drugged and your body reacted, that's all.
So... what else do you remember?
Whatever he may have made you do... that's on him.
That's not on you.
Nothing else happened.
I just want to go home.
Okay.
_
Happy holidays, everyone.
Mr. Basinski, how do you plead?
Not guilty, Your Honor.
My client has been a well-respected teacher and coach for the past 16 years.
The only reason he's here is because another teacher, an admitted pedophile, cut a deal implicating him.
We request R.O.R.
Mr. O'Dwyer?
Mr. Basinski was found with an intoxicated 15-year-old.
He is being charged with kidnapping, rape in the first, and promoting the sexual performance of a child.
He may be a danger to himself and others, and he has daily contact with minors... potential victims.
You don't need to oversell, Counselor.
Mr. Basinski, bail is set at $500,000.
Should you make bond, you will be required to wear an electronic monitor and be forbidden contact with any minors.
- Understood?
- Yes, Your Honor.
Mr. and Mrs. Foster.
Lieutenant Benson said you needed to speak with me.
Actually, we don't.
But this was her idea.
They're having second thoughts about allowing Zach to testify.
Okay, well... this is a natural reaction to a traumatic experience.
Coach is out on bail.
Yes.
He put up his house as collateral.
He has to wear a monitor.
He will not go near your son or any other kid.
This is all over the news.
There are photographers at the arraignment.
Other moms are calling me, asking about Zach.
And I explained to the Fosters that there are rape shield laws in place.
Everyone at school knows Ms. Burnap and Coach Basinski were both arrested.
My boy's had it rough enough at school.
If word gets out that Ms. Burnap sent those sexts and seduced him, well, that's one thing, but I don't... we don't want the whole world knowing he's the kid who got it from the wrestling coach.
And we understand that.
And what we're asking you to do is not easy.
But you both are in a very emotional place right now...
Thank you for your help.
Serena, we're leaving.
Well, I'm sorry, I...
I tried.
You know what?
If it were my son, I don't know what I would do.
Look, it's a reach, but there are other boys.
Well, I need one of them to come forward.
Nat.
You got a minute?
Not really.
I'm, uh, Lieutenant Benson.
And I just wanted to thank you.
Because of your help, we were able to find Zach and Coach Basinski.
Zach okay?
Yeah, he will be.
We hope.
Well, good.
- Is that all?
- No.
No, it's not.
You know, Basinski will be going to trial.
So we want to get as many stories on the record as we can.
You found him with Zach.
That's enough to bury him, right?
Well...
Zach's parents might not let him testify.
Even so, the guy's going away.
Listen, the truth is, is that we need your help.
You mean testify?
- No.
Forget that.
- Hold on, just hear us out.
If we can't get more stories, he might take a plea.
And how many do you have so far?
That's what I thought.
Forget it.
I'm not gonna be your guinea pig.
Sorry.
Struck out.
Edward Yamaguchi wants to see Basinski in jail, but he's not gonna get involved.
Where are we on the ten we ID'd?
Edward was the last of them.
Zach, Nat, they're not gonna testify.
Sam Moreau is dead,
Enrique Familia's back in Colombia.
These two swear nothing happened and these three don't want their spouses or family to find out.
Look it.
You know how it goes... when a boy goes through something like this, they never tell anyone.
Excuse me.
Nat.
Can we help you?
I think I can help you.
You're willing to make a statement?
I don't have to.
Got Coach's statement right here.
He confessed to everything.
Aah!
Nat, please!
Please...
There.
It's recording.
Tell them what you did.
Your own words.
You're having a hard time, but this is not...
I said tell them!
And he confessed of his own free will?
I encouraged him.
Okay!
Yes.
"Yes" what?
What did you do?
Yes, I had sex with you...
Not sex!
You raped us!
Aah!
Okay.
You raped all of us!
It's what they wanted.
I was there for them, for you.
- No!
Never!
- No?
- I just wanted your help!
- Well, that's what I did!
You wanted someone to care, and that's what I did.
Care?
Care?
You never cared!
How many boys did you have up on your wall?
- Like trophies!
- Ohh...
Tell me again!
I want names now!
I said tell me!
Ow!
Stop it!
I want names!
Okay, it was...
Sam Moreau.
Enrique Familia.
Edward Yamaguchi.
He names four others and me.
Is that enough?
Go.
He's alive!
We're gonna need that bus.
All right, hang on.
Just hang on.
Coach Basinski died in the ambulance en route to the hospital.
He must've been in a lot of pain.
Did he bleed to death?
He did.
Good.
When did this happen?
Last night.
I got my first good night's sleep in eight years.
Don't I need to make a statement or something?
No.
Not yet.
You're under arrest for murder now.
I need to read you your rights again.
You have the right to remain silent.
- Anything you...
- I know all that.
You have the right to an attorney.
- I don't need one.
- Yes, you do.
We'll be right back.
You're not saying anything until a lawyer gets here.
Do you usually encourage your suspects to get a lawyer?
This is on us.
We pushed this kid to testify.
That's not what he did.
He was trying to get a confession.
He was molested by the man that he killed.
He planned this.
He tortured that man.
He left him to die and was glad to hear that he bled out in pain.
It was premeditated.
You're gonna charge him with first-degree murder?
That's 25 years.
His lawyer can plead for leniency at sentencing.
His life will be over.
Lieutenant, his life...
was over at 15.
Bones, you sure you don't want to run over your testimony for the morning?
No need.
I'm fully prepared.
Just so you know,
I'm hearing talk of suspension, possible anger management classes.
Both a waste of my time and the FBI's resources.
Bones, you know what?
You punched a suspect.
After that misogynist...
Meninist.
Same thing.
He told you to put a muzzle on me.
He's lucky all I did was punch him.
All right, just so you know, that the, uh, the Bureau is very big on accountability and remorse.
But I'm not sorry for my actions.
Uh-uh.
They don't need to know that.
You're making this a much larger deal than it needs to be, Booth.
So there's no scenario where you-you could take my advice.
Not off the top of my head, unlikely.
Okay, I got it.
What if I do that thing, huh?
That thing that you like.
That you wrote about, uh, in your book on page 187.
Bam.
Well, as much as I typically enjoy the thing on page 187,
I'm not currently in the mood for that particular thing.
Ah, here's a good one. 92.
The thing that you talk about on 92.
You love that.
That involves a jump.
92.
I'm not sure, but, um...
I'll wear the rabbit ears.
I might be persuaded to take your advice for the thing on page 214.
214.
What's 214?
Ah.
Very tribal.
We are in like Flynn.
214.
I will prepare the deck.
I'll grab the masks.
Is it possible that we just watched seven Star Wars movies in a row?
Well, the extreme pain in my lower back is making me believe that it is.
I told you you should have done those stretches with me.
Eh, I don't know, you know.
The bridges and the splitsy things, that just doesn't come as naturally to me as it does to you.
Well, fair enough.
You know, my yoga coach has mentioned that I have very open hips.
Oh, yeah?
Mm-hmm.
Yoga dude gettin' a little handsy?
Is that jealousy I sense?
Why would I be jealous?
It's not like you and I are...
No, I mean, of course not.
I mean, I would.
You would?
Would you?
Right now?
It feels like a moment.
And we've already let so many other moments pass by.
Oh!
Oh, oh.
Oh!
Oh, wow, are you okay?
Yeah, no, super, super okay.
It's a dead body.
Wow.
Nothing says romantic like having your first kiss interrupted by murder.
Or dirty street water.
This is pretty gnarly.
Yeah, the victim was discovered by road crews cleaning up a mudslide near Baltimore.
Was that cause of death?
I don't think so.
The decomp's pretty advanced, but the mudslide sure did a hell of a job on the remains.
Yeah, you're telling me.
Check out all these fractures on the X-rays.
That slide was one bumpy toboggan ride.
Uh, the slightly raised ridge across the central surface of the pubis, plus the anteriorly-positioned mandible tell me the victim is female.
And the receding zygomatics and wear on the dentition suggest that the victim is of Negroid descent and in her early 30s.
Presence of hairy maggot blowfly larvae suggests the victim was buried in a shallow grave, approximately two weeks before the mudslide.
That tracks with the vitreous humor in the remaining eyeball.
Hey, honey, is your shoulder okay?
Hey, what time is Brennan's hearing?
Wait, hearing?
What hearing?
I think it's going on right now.
Brennan punched a suspect.
That's a big no-no at the FBI.
Go, Dr. B.
I knew there was a reason she's my hero.
Yeah, well, I think it's got her into a bit of trouble now.
Oh, come on.
She's so good at her job, what could they possibly do to her?
Dr. Brennan,
I'm not sure you understand the severity of the situation.
You assaulted a suspect.
The FBI does not take that lightly.
Nonsense.
Between the years 1993 and 2011, FBI agents either injured or killed 150 people using firearms.
Your internal investigations let each of those agents off without a charge.
You punched an unarmed man.
And he deserved it.
You seem to believe that that excuses your actions.
That is correct.
I have no more questions at this moment.
Tomorrow, we speak to your partner.
If his testimony goes anything like yours, Dr. Brennan, you will no longer be allowed to work with the Bureau.
The panel is adjourned until tomorrow.

Hey.
How did the hearing go?
There seems to be a divide in our mutual understanding of what occurred between Mr. Walters and myself.
You're saying you didn't punch him?
Not at all.
I merely argued that I should not be held accountable.
Bet they loved that.
Unfortunately, I believe it had the opposite effect.
Uh, maybe we should get back to the case.
Hmm.
Damage to the heart muscle indicates significant endocarditis.
Heart disease?
Actually, it looks more like the kind of damage
I see on drug addicts.
I'll run a tox screen.
Ms. Warren, what do you see regarding the surgical rod in the victim's right femur?
Remodeling?
I'm referring to the rod itself.
There are no nails to hold it in place.
This kind of surgical rod has not been used in most orthopedic surgical centers in decades.
The injury's that old?
Well, not according to the remodeling, which appears to be approximately four years old.
Why was a recent injury treated with such outdated equipment?
It's unclear.
However, it should be easy to track the rod itself, given its uncommon nature.
An injury that bad, she must have been laid up for months.
That's got to suck.
Well, at least she walked again.
Yes.
I don't believe the injury caused any lasting damage.
No, I think that was about Hodgins.
Uh, not to be too nosy, but you guys do seem a little...
Cold?
Distant?
Or maybe the part where he takes all of his crap out on me?
Is it truly that bad?
I don't think it can get much worse.
Honestly, he's pushing me away.
Yeah, I did see that whole hand to the shoulder shrug-off thing.
Well, that's just par for the course these days.
Oh, here we go.
Got it.
All right.
Now you can go get an ID.
Uh, but you don't have to go right now, 'cause, you know, we're talking.
It's okay.
I, uh, I should stay busy.
You missed?
Wow.
You've never kissed a girl before, Aubrey?
What?
No, of course I have.
Lots of times.
It's just... have you ever tried to do something, but the timing was just all off?
You know what?
The timing's off now.
Let's just get back to the case, all right?
All right.
Okay.
Well, the body dump was in a pretty isolated area.
Not a lot of people around there.
Yeah, but if you go three miles straight into Baltimore, you're gonna be smack right in the middle of Perkins Homes.
Gangland.
So what, you thinking drugs?
That tracks with the heart damage that Cam found.
You ever hear of a drug called a Wiley Monkey?
Any relation to the coyote?
Anyhow, it's a, uh, big drug now in, uh, Southeast, uh, Baltimore.
It has, what, cocaine, heroin, household cleaning products in it.
Did you tell Cam?
Well, I was going to until you came in here crying about all your girl problems.
I'm not crying.
I just, I thought, you know, maybe you could give me some words of advice, if you have any.
Okay, look, Aubrey.
You know what?
There's, you know, the first kiss is always awkward.
There's lots of awkward moments.
I mean, Bones and I, we had, uh, we had many awkward moments.
Yeah, but now you're happily married.
Yeah, but we wouldn't have been happily married if we gave up after that first awkward moment.
Angela, these are spectacular.
Really?
A true improvement.
Uh, you can sit down.
It's just, uh, next time can we meet at my studio?
Oh, yeah.
In-instead of here?
It'd be more private.
Oh, your studio is Cam-free, right?
Oh, uh... don't-don't let me interrupt.
No, no, no, no.
No interruption.
I'm actually heading out the door.
Set for next time?
Yeah.
That was weird.
Yeah.
So, what's set for next time?
Oh, just where we're gonna meet up so we can go over these photos.
What's up?
My initial tox screen came back negative, so I tested some adipose tissue.
I'm pretty sure the victim was drug-free for about a decade.
I think I might know why she stopped using.
So, the only facility in the area that still uses those outdated surgical rods is a hospital in West Virginia.
The facility primarily treats inmates from the local penitentiary.
So the victim was Lola Marshall, 32.
She served 10 years for dealing crack.
Wait, does that say "fugitive?"
Yeah.
She was released from prison to the halfway house in January.
But she disappeared from there two weeks ago.
That's when the warrant went out for her rearrest.
I imagine the residents of this neighborhood would be quite displeased to have criminals living among them.
It's definitely not the suburban dream.
You must be Agent Aubrey and Dr. Brennan.
Thomas Hemingway.
You the owner of this halfway house Mr. Hemingway?
Thomas, and yes, uh, I've owned and operated
Next Step for nearly seven years now.
Hey, Louis.
30 minutes late for curfew last night.
The bus ran late.
You should have called.
You know the rules.
I'm gonna have to write you up.
And you know what happens next time.
What happens next time?
I have to send him back.
I have a responsibility to both these inmates and the community.
It means making a lot of tough choices.
Come on inside.
Through this doorway is our group therapy room.
And, uh, was Lola involved in group therapy as well?
Certainly, yeah.
We-we focus on coping mechanisms in high-stress environments.
Mock interviews, conflict resolution.
And how did Lola do with that?
Well, actually.
Uh, she got a job almost immediately.
Donuts R Us.
Yeah, she was a model inmate.
Never missed curfew, until, uh...
Until she disappeared.
Yeah.
You think Lola might have returned to her old lifestyle, don't you?
I hope not, but...
I couldn't say.
Okay, well, who could?
Lola's roommate, Jasmine.
Uh, if anyone would know, it's her.
You had been Lola's roommate since January-- you two must have been close.
Did she tell you where she was going the night she disappeared?
Mm-mm.
Like you said, me and Lola were pretty tight.
If she was planning on leaving, she would have told me.
Did she ever tell you about her life before prison?
You mean her slinging dope in the projects?
Yeah.
So do you think it's possible that Lola went back to selling drugs?
No.
She told me this story.
Like, four years ago in prison,
White Angels of Mercy beat the black off her one day in the showers.
What does that have to do with Lola's recidivism?
Uh, she was in the infirmary for months, bored out of her skull.
That's when she got her GED, turned her stuff around.
No way she worked that hard just to give it all up.
Was there anyone she didn't get along with?
There was this chump, Kenny J.
He bounced out after her first two weeks, though.
What did Kenny have against her?
Kenny was Lola's supplier.
She turned state's on him for a reduced sentence.
Okay, did Kenny have a last name?
Johnson.
You know this guy, Booth?
Um, thanks, um,
Kenny and I, we were in prison together.
You have something to show me, Ms. Warren?
Oh, Dr. Saroyan, yes.
Um, as I was re-articulating,
I noticed extensive fractures on the ribs, skull and scapulae.
The severity makes me think the victim was beaten with some kind of blunt weapon.
Repeated strikes indicate a crime of passion, so this wasn't premeditated.
Exactly.
The killer was probably super pissed.
I'm vibing we've got cause of death, but I think Dr. B's gonna want more than that.
Let me know when you have a definitive answer on cause of death.
You do not need my permission to do what you want to do, Angela.
I'm not asking your permission.
I...
Can't we even just talk about anything anymore?
I just wanted to know your opinion.
You want to go spend time with Sebastian in his studio.
I support you.
Then why does it sound like you hate the idea?
Forget how I sound.
You do you, I'll do me.
That's not how marriage works.
At least, that's not how our marriage works.
Well, things change.
Uh, sorry.
I'll come back.
No, no, Cam.
Your timing is perfect.
Sure?
Yeah, we... uh... we're fine.
We're done talking, or whatever you want to call what we were just doing.
Okay.
Hodgins, I wanted you to take a look at this tissue.
It looks like burn marks, but I haven't seen any other signs of burning in the sludge.
Neither did I on the remains.
Okay, all right.
Just leave this with me.
I'll test it for particulates and figure out what left such an isolated mark.
Thanks.
I'm just gonna...
Me, too.
I met Kenny in prison, before they dropped the charges against me.
The guy's got one hell of a record.
Seems kind of dangerous.
Okay, Kenny was the only guy in there who had my back.
It's not easy being friends with a cop.
That's fair enough, but Baltimore PD has him listed as a known suspect in at least two murders.
Rumors.
Nothing else.
Why are you protecting this guy?
I told you.
I know him, all right?
He's a good guy, or at least he's a reformed guy.
I'm just saying, try to keep an open mind.
And I'm just saying, innocent until proven guilty, right?
Hey!
Look at you.
Hot damn, that you Seeley Booth?
How are you?
Kenny J, he looks good.
Hey, man.
This here is my partner, Agent Aubrey.
Your partner.
Yeah.
I'm guessing this isn't a social call.
I'll tell you what, can we talk over here?
All right, so, um, , listen.
Lola Marshall is dead.
And you think I did it.
We just got to rule you out, Kenny.
That's all.
Actually, we're here to ask you a few questions.
When was the last time you saw Lola?
I don't know, probably when I left Next Step.
We ignored each other.
All right, you grow up the way I did, you get real good at ignoring schmucks.
Still, living in the same house as the woman who got you locked up-- that must have been hard.
Look, uh, you see that?
That's just the one I got for being chill with this guy.
All right, I got no interest in living with my head on a swivel again.
I'll tell you what, all we need is an alibi.
Where were you, uh, two weeks ago, late Friday?
I had to guess, I'd say at home, sleeping.
Watching TV.
Life's pretty boring, now.
So, in other words, you don't have an alibi.
Look, Booth, you know me.
I-I'm no killer.
Look, I'll tell you what, we know how to get in touch with you if we have any more questions, okay?
I got a few quest...
I'm proud of you, Kenny.
Take care of yourself, all right?
Come on.
The hell was that?
He doesn't need an alibi?
Booth, you're too close to this.
Stop, okay?
You saw him.
The guy got stabbed for me.
Yeah, but just because he protected you then, doesn't mean it's right for you to protect him now.
Don't tell me how to do my job, Aubrey.
The guy's a suspect in a murder investigation.
My gut says there's nothing here.
Your gut?
Booth, are you the lead on this case or his friend?
Get in the car.
I'm here, caffeinated and I'm ready to jam on some bones.
Good timing.
Hodgins just gave me his analysis of the burn mark I found.
It's gunshot residue, which means the victim wasn't just beaten, she was shot.
Aubrey tried to kiss me.
Tried to kiss you?
Yeah, it was a weird timing thing.
Um, but, our entire relationship has been a weird timing thing.
Oh, well, I didn't know that it was technically a relationship.
Because of the slowness.
Glaciers move faster.
Um, I mean, I think the feelings are there, but what if it doesn't matter?
What if the physical is just never there?
And then I never have another orgasm, and life is just a futile existence of jumping from one binge-watched show to another.
Wow.
Jessica, Aubrey is crazy about you.
It's obvious.
You think the fact that it's taken you guys months to get to an actual kiss, may have built it up a bit?
It's so frustrating.
I mean, I'm normally the forward one.
Why can't I be here?
Because you're scared.
Maybe you feel differently about him than you have about anyone else.
You know, it's easy to want to run away from things that scare you.
Easier than trying to fight through the complications.
Do you want to talk about things?
Yes.
This gunshot wound.
Until we find what part of the body this tissue is from...
We won't know whether the gunshot wound was fatal.
Exactly.
I'm on it.
Wow.
Oh, my God.
These are incredible.
Each is a piece of my soul.
That's what photography is, Angela.
It's finding the truth, the beauty, where you least expect it.
Yeah, but how do you... how do you know where to look?
You don't.
Not at first, at least.
It calls to me, though.
What does?
Beauty.
Sebastian.
Angela.
- Oh, Angela.
- Angela.
Angela.
Oh.
Hi, what are you... what are you doing here?
I thought you were having a bad dream.
Uh, yeah, I-I was.
I-I-I have not been sleeping well lately.
Anyway, I think I narrowed down where the victim was the day she died.
Great.
Great.
You should...
You should tell Booth and Aubrey.
Yeah, that's where I was heading before I heard you talking in your sleep.
You said his name, you know.
So we know that our victim was somewhere in Northeast Baltimore the day she was killed.
The tower that her cell phone pinged off of, it services this three-mile radius right around here.
I'm a visual person, okay?
I got to be able to see it.
Identifying the problem-- that's half the battle.
I-I found two other anomalies, when I was searching through the sludge, right?
The first one being rock salt.
The stuff that they use to defrost the streets when it snows?
Yeah, that's right.
Now, this type of rock salt, it's composed of sodium chloride and contains traces of cyanide.
Great, so the public service departments are trying to kill us.
Well, unfortunately, due to its toxicity, it's only used in certain poorer neighborhoods, like this one right in here.
That is still a lot of territory to cover.
You still haven't heard the pièce de résistance:
Fresh tar on the victim's shoe treads.
In our narrowed-down area here, of French fry quarter, the only street being re-paved on the day of Lola's murder, was this one here,
Kennison Avenue, right by the Arlington Estate Co-ops.
So what was Lola doing at the Co-ops?
I don't know, man.
That's all you.
I found slight fractures on the inferior surfaces of the carpals.
At first, I thought they were postmortem, maybe even the result of the mudslide she was buried in.
You were mistaken.
Yes.
The inferior surfaces of the carpals and tarsals, are fractured in the same way, indicative of a repeated stress injury over a short period of time.
Suggesting?
Suggesting the victim fought back.
These are defensive wounds.
You are incorrect again, Ms. Warren.
I have seen injuries similar to these in instances where the victim was buried alive.
The fractures are reflective of clawing or kicking her way out of an enclosed space.
Whoa.
This just got way darker and creepier.
Oh, um, I found something else.
Note the slight widening of the victim's pubic symphysis.
The victim has given birth before.
While she was still maturing.
You are speculating that the baby is now old enough to be the killer.
An angry kid abandoned by his mother?
Youknow, it's interesting to me that you didn't even visit or-or speak to your mother the whole time that she was in prison.
She didn't want me, why should I want her?
Anger and resentment are very rational feelings after being abandoned by a parent.
So what?
So those feelings didn't just go away when she moved to the halfway house.
Maybe she tried to look you up, and you couldn't see that she'd changed.
You're bitter, so you lashed out, and you killed her.
You have no idea what you're talking about.
Okay, then what changed?
Why go back and visit her now, after all of these years?
You're sweating, and it's only 70 degrees in here.
You're showing evidence of ptyalism, and your nostrils have begun broadening.
Ptyalism, right.
Except, what does that mean?
She's pregnant.
I'm right, aren't I?
Yes.
I'm three months.
Well, taking care of yourself after aging out of the system is scary enough.
Taking care of a baby on top of that...
Maybe you thought that your mother owed you something.
Then maybe you thought you can get something from her.
Then you found out that she had nothing.
And then you snapped.
You think I killed her?
!
No way!
She said she wanted us to be a family.
She said she wanted to take care of us.
That she had a real job, and that she was gonna break the cycle.
So I said okay.
I wanted that, too.
I didn't kill her.
I let myself believe that I have a future, but, I I'm alone again.
Kalani, you need to tell us if there's anything about your mother's life that may have gotten her killed.
She seemed... excited.
She-she was saving up so that when I turn 18 we could get an apartment together.
We were making plans.
Okay, look, were there any changes in habit here?
Did she have any new acquaintances in her life?
Anything like that?
Uh, the last time I saw her, sh-she was frustrated, because she had to leave early.
Something a-about some friend, some Kenny guy, was waiting in the car for her.
Kenny, Kenny Johnson?
I don't know his last name.
Just that they were at the halfway house together.
Note the slight abrasions on the superior nuchal line.
Damage from the mudslide?
Uh, I do not believe so.
These appear to be perimortem and are inconsistent with any of the other injuries sustained during the victim's murder.
Which is why I want you to swab for trace.
Booth and I spoke with Lola's daughter, Kalani.
The foster kid.
How did that go?
I remember being her age, and having no one to turn to, and having no idea what was coming next.
I recall a feeling of being overtaken, as though, if I forced myself, to think about the future, I would implode.
Angela tell you to talk to me?
No.
But, Dr. Hodgins, you're my friend and my colleague, and I care about you.
Sometimes it doesn't matter if you have the whole world supporting you, success can be just out of reach.
Then success must be redefined as that which can be accomplished.
If Kalani can't have a family with her mother and her child, then she must find an alternative that she can live with.
And if I can't find an alternative?
You have to to survive.
You make a faulty assumption, Dr. Brennan.
Survival doesn't necessarily mean living.
Kenny.
Booth, what's up, man?
What's up is that you lied to me.
Last time I asked you if you saw Lola, and you said it was, like, months.
Now I find out that you saw her the day she disappeared?
Look, you don't know what it's like.
All right, you got out of prison, right back to your cush job.
Me?
To the world, I'm just an ex-con.
Do you know how hard it was for me to get a job with my record?
I mean, they find out I'm involved in an FBI investigation, how long you think they'll let me stay?
And I didn't kill that woman.
Then why didn't you just say you were with her?
You know, back in the day, Lola ran product for me.
All right, best thing you can do right now is tell me something that I don't know.
Kalani's mine.
You and Lola were in a relationship?
No, it was casual, part of the lifestyle.
Of course, she didn't tell me the baby was mine until a month ago.
Wow.
It's not like you guys were on good terms, though.
She was all about giving Kalani a family.
It wasn't about me and her getting together, she just...
I don't know, man, she just wanted Kalani to know she has a dad.
Uh, sounds like to me, that she wanted the three of you to have a second chance.
Well, anyway, I couldn't go through with it.
I mean, look at me, man.
You think I'm a worthy dad?
If I was my dad, I'd run the other way.
All right, so yeah, I stayed in the car.
And then drove Lola back to Next Step.
And that's the last I saw her.
I swear.
I had a sex dream about Sebastian.
And Hodgins knows.
Okay.
Well, um...
Angela, do you intend to cheat on Hodgins with Sebastian?
No.
No.
Except what if part of me wants to?
I mean, I don't, I don't want to cheat on Hodgins.
I love him.
At least, I love the Hodgins that I married.
You believe his injury has damaged him irreparably?
Hasn't it?
It's not even about him not walking.
It's-it's him.
He's different.
He's... distant.
It just... it doesn't feel like a real marriage anymore.
The injury didn't impact Hodgins' spinal reflexes at a sacral level.
He's still sexually capable.
Yeah, everything about him is still capable of it.
It just doesn't make a difference if he's given up.
He can't fix that void, if he doesn't take responsibility for creating it.
I-I-I can't make him change unless he wants to.
And if he never wants to?
The rug in here is a definite match for the fiber Hodgins found in the occipital injury.
So Jasmine and Lola's room could be our crime scene.
Hodgins also found trace of brass.
Uh, maybe from what she was beaten with?
Hey, um, so should we talk?
You mean, instead of awkwardly avoiding the pink elephant in the room?
Yeah, something like that.
Then, no.
Uh, not now.
Let's get through this case.
This looks like brass.
It's not working.
It's got a broken bulb in it.
For a lamp that's not working, this one sure is lighting up like a Christmas tree.
Blood?
Definitely.
What the hell are y'all doing in my room?
This here's private property.
Jasmine Santangelo, you're under arrest for the murder of your roommate,
Lola Marshall.
Man, hell no... what the...
Aubrey.
Got something else.
You gonna deny that those drugs belong to you, too?
I didn't think so.
Let's go.
Found over a half kilo of Wiley Monkey in your room, Jasmine.
You can't prove that's mine.
Shouldn't be hard to convince a jury that a killer, fresh out of jail, got involved in the drug trade and another murder.
I didn't mean to kill my stepdad.
I just wanted him to leave me alone and stop touching me, and I swear I didn't kill Lola.
Here's how it went down in my head.
She found your stash, threatened to turn you in, so you beat her to death with that lamp.
Man, I didn't even know she was dead until y'all FBI agents showed up at Next Step.
I liked Lola.
She was good to me.
I didn't hurt her.
Somebody did.
Maybe your supplier found out that she knew your little secret.
Jasmine, listen to me.
I want to believe you, but you've got to give me something to go on here.
I can't.
It doesn't matter if I talk.
Either you'll throw me back in prison, or he will kill me.
He who?
I can't tell you.
I can't.
Ms. Warren.
Please take a look at the posterior surfaces of the left third through fifth vertebral ribs.
Now, run your finger along the damage.
It feels like pitting.
I don't understand.
How does this help us find the path of the bullet?
It doesn't.
This pitting is not the direct result of the bullet wound.
So how does that help us?
Have Dr. Hodgins swab for trace.
I need to find Angela.
So the victim was leaning up against something, like a wall?
Based on the severity of the blunt force trauma,
I would postulate that it's much more likely that at least initially, she was lying down, near unconsciousness.
Now, I believe when the bullet passed through her body, it hit the surface she was lying on, causing debris to blow back into her ribs.
Debris that was hard enough to cause pitting on the bones.
Got something for you.
Dr. Hodgins.
Do you have the results of your swabs of the injuries?
Yeah, I ran them through microspectrophotometry, and found traces of steel and also carpet fiber.
It's a polyester and polyolefin blend, like what you'd find in the trunk of a car.
Angela, now place the victim inside the trunk of a car.
The amount of damage caused by the beating suggests the killer presumed Lola was dead when he placed her in the vehicle.
You think she regained consciousness and tried to claw her way out as he was driving.
Then when the killer reached the dumpsite, he found she was still alive, and he shot her.
The bullet hit the bottom of the trunk with enough force to cause the blowback which ricocheted into her body.
Dr. Hodgins, can you determine the kind of car based on the carpet fibers and the metal alloy?
Uh, yeah, actually, I already did.
Mazda, BMW, Ford Mustang and Fusion.
Wait, BMW?
There was a BMW at the halfway house.
Uh, I'll notify Booth and Aubrey.
I-I already told you guys everything I know.
No.
We think you might have left out a few details.
Such as the fact that you're the murderer.
That's bull.
I mean, you don't have any proof.
Lola discovered Jasmine was working for you.
She refused to participate in your scam, didn't she?
Maybe she even threatened to turn you in?
You couldn't stand for that, so you beat her, and you threw her in your car.
When you saw she was still alive, you shot her.
That's a great story.
Great story.
I don't know who's gonna believe you.
I-I-I'm a public servant.
I have years of experience.
But our lab can tie Lola's body and injuries directly to your car.
We have indisputable physical evidence, Mr. Hemingway.
Was it so wrong wanting to make a little something on the side?
You know, do something for myself for once.
I mean, half those fools, they'd be back in the lifestyle with or without me.
I bet they can't wait to see you on the other side of the bars.
Okay, you can't send me there.
They'll kill me.
Relax, Thomas.
I'm sure they'll show you the same kindness that you showed them.
You ready to go home?
Yes, but not with you.
Okay, look, if this is about the dream, then I think that we...
This has nothing to do with your dream, Angela.
What is this?
That's everything.
It's all my money, property, and it's all yours.
Whoa, wait, um, I'm sorry.
I... this feels like, um, are you trying to...
We're broken.
And it's my fault, because I am... miserable.
And what's worse is
I'm making you miserable.
So change.
I know that this is painful for you, and I know that you think that I couldn't possibly understand what it's like.
But this is life.
It's hard, and it is painful, and it is every day.
But we fight.
We fight together.
This is my decision.
No, this is a coward's decision.
I am not letting you make it.
I don't care about any of the stuff in this folder.
I need you.
See you at home.

Aw, thanks, boyfriend.
I mean, my friend who is a boy.
Attaboy, Aubrey.
So, I, uh, want to kiss you.
Uh, do you think maybe it means something that you haven't yet, that we haven't...
No, it's my fault.
I mean, I built it up in my head, and now it's like this big T. Rex.
Big with short arms?
Yeah, it's-it's scary.
Yeah, I get that, um.
Yeah, but, um, uh, I'm not in a rush.
Are you?
I mean, normally, I'm really good at this kind of thing.
You know what that tells me?
That what you and I have isn't normal.
It's more special than that.
See you tomorrow?
Count on it.
Jessica!
I take full responsibility for my aggressive actions against Paul Walters, and I am prepared to accept the punishment that fits the crime.
Agent Booth, are you in agreement with your partner's assessment of the situation in question?
Completely.
And you are convinced that such actions will not be repeated in the future?
You see, Dr. Brennan represents this Bureau and its values more than any agent that I have ever worked with.
I mean, sh-she made a mistake.
Look, we all do.
And we all are gonna make mistakes in the future, and we should be able to make those mistakes.
We should be able to learn from them, grow from them, and be given a second chance.
I mean, will Bones here ever punch anyone again?
I-I-I can't say, but you should give her a chance to try.
You want this committee to forego punishment so Dr. Brennan can try not to hit people?
I will not be trying;
I will succeed.
I have no doubt you will.
With Agent Booth's help.
Exactly.
I'm sorry?
Dr. Brennan, this committee is placing you on six month's probation, to be overseen by Agent Booth.
A failure on your part will be considered a failure on his part.
We'll take it.
No, no.
Agent Booth didn't do anything wrong.
He should not be held accountable for my actions.
It doesn't matter because you're not going to do it again, right?
That's not the point.
It is the point.
You're... you are gonna do it again?
No.
Booth.
What?
Has a decision been made here?
Can you just give me one second?
Clearly not the point.
The point is, that you're not gonna hit anyone again, right?
That's not the point.
She's not... she's not going to hit anyone ever again.
- We accept.
- We're not accepting.
- We accept.
- No.
We are not...
- Not gonna take that.
- That's fine, yes, we'll take that.
What's that mean?
Bones, you sure you don't want to run over your testimony for the morning?
No need.
I'm fully prepared.
Just so you know,
I'm hearing talk of suspension, possible anger management classes.
Both a waste of my time and the FBI's resources.
Bones, you know what?
You punched a suspect.
After that misogynist...
Meninist.
Same thing.
He told you to put a muzzle on me.
He's lucky all I did was punch him.
All right, just so you know, that the, uh, the Bureau is very big on accountability and remorse.
But I'm not sorry for my actions.
Uh-uh.
They don't need to know that.
You're making this a much larger deal than it needs to be, Booth.
So there's no scenario where you-you could take my advice.
Not off the top of my head, unlikely.
Okay, I got it.
What if I do that thing, huh?
That thing that you like.
That you wrote about, uh, in your book on page 187.
Bam.
Well, as much as I typically enjoy the thing on page 187,
I'm not currently in the mood for that particular thing.
Ah, here's a good one. 92.
The thing that you talk about on 92.
You love that.
That involves a jump.
92.
I'm not sure, but, um...
I'll wear the rabbit ears.
I might be persuaded to take your advice for the thing on page 214.
214.
What's 214?
Ah.
Very tribal.
We are in like Flynn.
214.
I will prepare the deck.
I'll grab the masks.
Is it possible that we just watched seven Star Wars movies in a row?
Well, the extreme pain in my lower back is making me believe that it is.
I told you you should have done those stretches with me.
Eh, I don't know, you know.
The bridges and the splitsy things, that just doesn't come as naturally to me as it does to you.
Well, fair enough.
You know, my yoga coach has mentioned that I have very open hips.
Oh, yeah?
Mm-hmm.
Yoga dude gettin' a little handsy?
Is that jealousy I sense?
Why would I be jealous?
It's not like you and I are...
No, I mean, of course not.
I mean, I would.
You would?
Would you?
Right now?
It feels like a moment.
And we've already let so many other moments pass by.
Oh!
Oh, oh.
Oh!
Oh, wow, are you okay?
Yeah, no, super, super okay.
It's a dead body.
Wow.
Nothing says romantic like having your first kiss interrupted by murder.
Or dirty street water.
This is pretty gnarly.
Yeah, the victim was discovered by road crews cleaning up a mudslide near Baltimore.
Was that cause of death?
I don't think so.
The decomp's pretty advanced, but the mudslide sure did a hell of a job on the remains.
Yeah, you're telling me.
Check out all these fractures on the X-rays.
That slide was one bumpy toboggan ride.
Uh, the slightly raised ridge across the central surface of the pubis, plus the anteriorly-positioned mandible tell me the victim is female.
And the receding zygomatics and wear on the dentition suggest that the victim is of Negroid descent and in her early 30s.
Presence of hairy maggot blowfly larvae suggests the victim was buried in a shallow grave, approximately two weeks before the mudslide.
That tracks with the vitreous humor in the remaining eyeball.
Hey, honey, is your shoulder okay?
Hey, what time is Brennan's hearing?
Wait, hearing?
What hearing?
I think it's going on right now.
Brennan punched a suspect.
That's a big no-no at the FBI.
Go, Dr. B.
I knew there was a reason she's my hero.
Yeah, well, I think it's got her into a bit of trouble now.
Oh, come on.
She's so good at her job, what could they possibly do to her?
Dr. Brennan,
I'm not sure you understand the severity of the situation.
You assaulted a suspect.
The FBI does not take that lightly.
Nonsense.
Between the years 1993 and 2011, FBI agents either injured or killed 150 people using firearms.
Your internal investigations let each of those agents off without a charge.
You punched an unarmed man.
And he deserved it.
You seem to believe that that excuses your actions.
That is correct.
I have no more questions at this moment.
Tomorrow, we speak to your partner.
If his testimony goes anything like yours, Dr. Brennan, you will no longer be allowed to work with the Bureau.
The panel is adjourned until tomorrow.

Hey.
How did the hearing go?
There seems to be a divide in our mutual understanding of what occurred between Mr. Walters and myself.
You're saying you didn't punch him?
Not at all.
I merely argued that I should not be held accountable.
Bet they loved that.
Unfortunately, I believe it had the opposite effect.
Uh, maybe we should get back to the case.
Hmm.
Damage to the heart muscle indicates significant endocarditis.
Heart disease?
Actually, it looks more like the kind of damage
I see on drug addicts.
I'll run a tox screen.
Ms. Warren, what do you see regarding the surgical rod in the victim's right femur?
Remodeling?
I'm referring to the rod itself.
There are no nails to hold it in place.
This kind of surgical rod has not been used in most orthopedic surgical centers in decades.
The injury's that old?
Well, not according to the remodeling, which appears to be approximately four years old.
Why was a recent injury treated with such outdated equipment?
It's unclear.
However, it should be easy to track the rod itself, given its uncommon nature.
An injury that bad, she must have been laid up for months.
That's got to suck.
Well, at least she walked again.
Yes.
I don't believe the injury caused any lasting damage.
No, I think that was about Hodgins.
Uh, not to be too nosy, but you guys do seem a little...
Cold?
Distant?
Or maybe the part where he takes all of his crap out on me?
Is it truly that bad?
I don't think it can get much worse.
Honestly, he's pushing me away.
Yeah, I did see that whole hand to the shoulder shrug-off thing.
Well, that's just par for the course these days.
Oh, here we go.
Got it.
All right.
Now you can go get an ID.
Uh, but you don't have to go right now, 'cause, you know, we're talking.
It's okay.
I, uh, I should stay busy.
You missed?
Wow.
You've never kissed a girl before, Aubrey?
What?
No, of course I have.
Lots of times.
It's just... have you ever tried to do something, but the timing was just all off?
You know what?
The timing's off now.
Let's just get back to the case, all right?
All right.
Okay.
Well, the body dump was in a pretty isolated area.
Not a lot of people around there.
Yeah, but if you go three miles straight into Baltimore, you're gonna be smack right in the middle of Perkins Homes.
Gangland.
So what, you thinking drugs?
That tracks with the heart damage that Cam found.
You ever hear of a drug called a Wiley Monkey?
Any relation to the coyote?
Anyhow, it's a, uh, big drug now in, uh, Southeast, uh, Baltimore.
It has, what, cocaine, heroin, household cleaning products in it.
Did you tell Cam?
Well, I was going to until you came in here crying about all your girl problems.
I'm not crying.
I just, I thought, you know, maybe you could give me some words of advice, if you have any.
Okay, look, Aubrey.
You know what?
There's, you know, the first kiss is always awkward.
There's lots of awkward moments.
I mean, Bones and I, we had, uh, we had many awkward moments.
Yeah, but now you're happily married.
Yeah, but we wouldn't have been happily married if we gave up after that first awkward moment.
Angela, these are spectacular.
Really?
A true improvement.
Uh, you can sit down.
It's just, uh, next time can we meet at my studio?
Oh, yeah.
In-instead of here?
It'd be more private.
Oh, your studio is Cam-free, right?
Oh, uh... don't-don't let me interrupt.
No, no, no, no.
No interruption.
I'm actually heading out the door.
Set for next time?
Yeah.
That was weird.
Yeah.
So, what's set for next time?
Oh, just where we're gonna meet up so we can go over these photos.
What's up?
My initial tox screen came back negative, so I tested some adipose tissue.
I'm pretty sure the victim was drug-free for about a decade.
I think I might know why she stopped using.
So, the only facility in the area that still uses those outdated surgical rods is a hospital in West Virginia.
The facility primarily treats inmates from the local penitentiary.
So the victim was Lola Marshall, 32.
She served 10 years for dealing crack.
Wait, does that say "fugitive?"
Yeah.
She was released from prison to the halfway house in January.
But she disappeared from there two weeks ago.
That's when the warrant went out for her rearrest.
I imagine the residents of this neighborhood would be quite displeased to have criminals living among them.
It's definitely not the suburban dream.
You must be Agent Aubrey and Dr. Brennan.
Thomas Hemingway.
You the owner of this halfway house Mr. Hemingway?
Thomas, and yes, uh, I've owned and operated
Next Step for nearly seven years now.
Hey, Louis.
30 minutes late for curfew last night.
The bus ran late.
You should have called.
You know the rules.
I'm gonna have to write you up.
And you know what happens next time.
What happens next time?
I have to send him back.
I have a responsibility to both these inmates and the community.
It means making a lot of tough choices.
Come on inside.
Through this doorway is our group therapy room.
And, uh, was Lola involved in group therapy as well?
Certainly, yeah.
We-we focus on coping mechanisms in high-stress environments.
Mock interviews, conflict resolution.
And how did Lola do with that?
Well, actually.
Uh, she got a job almost immediately.
Donuts R Us.
Yeah, she was a model inmate.
Never missed curfew, until, uh...
Until she disappeared.
Yeah.
You think Lola might have returned to her old lifestyle, don't you?
I hope not, but...
I couldn't say.
Okay, well, who could?
Lola's roommate, Jasmine.
Uh, if anyone would know, it's her.
You had been Lola's roommate since January-- you two must have been close.
Did she tell you where she was going the night she disappeared?
Mm-mm.
Like you said, me and Lola were pretty tight.
If she was planning on leaving, she would have told me.
Did she ever tell you about her life before prison?
You mean her slinging dope in the projects?
Yeah.
So do you think it's possible that Lola went back to selling drugs?
No.
She told me this story.
Like, four years ago in prison,
White Angels of Mercy beat the black off her one day in the showers.
What does that have to do with Lola's recidivism?
Uh, she was in the infirmary for months, bored out of her skull.
That's when she got her GED, turned her stuff around.
No way she worked that hard just to give it all up.
Was there anyone she didn't get along with?
There was this chump, Kenny J.
He bounced out after her first two weeks, though.
What did Kenny have against her?
Kenny was Lola's supplier.
She turned state's on him for a reduced sentence.
Okay, did Kenny have a last name?
Johnson.
You know this guy, Booth?
Um, thanks, um,
Kenny and I, we were in prison together.
You have something to show me, Ms. Warren?
Oh, Dr. Saroyan, yes.
Um, as I was re-articulating,
I noticed extensive fractures on the ribs, skull and scapulae.
The severity makes me think the victim was beaten with some kind of blunt weapon.
Repeated strikes indicate a crime of passion, so this wasn't premeditated.
Exactly.
The killer was probably super pissed.
I'm vibing we've got cause of death, but I think Dr. B's gonna want more than that.
Let me know when you have a definitive answer on cause of death.
You do not need my permission to do what you want to do, Angela.
I'm not asking your permission.
I...
Can't we even just talk about anything anymore?
I just wanted to know your opinion.
You want to go spend time with Sebastian in his studio.
I support you.
Then why does it sound like you hate the idea?
Forget how I sound.
You do you, I'll do me.
That's not how marriage works.
At least, that's not how our marriage works.
Well, things change.
Uh, sorry.
I'll come back.
No, no, Cam.
Your timing is perfect.
Sure?
Yeah, we... uh... we're fine.
We're done talking, or whatever you want to call what we were just doing.
Okay.
Hodgins, I wanted you to take a look at this tissue.
It looks like burn marks, but I haven't seen any other signs of burning in the sludge.
Neither did I on the remains.
Okay, all right.
Just leave this with me.
I'll test it for particulates and figure out what left such an isolated mark.
Thanks.
I'm just gonna...
Me, too.
I met Kenny in prison, before they dropped the charges against me.
The guy's got one hell of a record.
Seems kind of dangerous.
Okay, Kenny was the only guy in there who had my back.
It's not easy being friends with a cop.
That's fair enough, but Baltimore PD has him listed as a known suspect in at least two murders.
Rumors.
Nothing else.
Why are you protecting this guy?
I told you.
I know him, all right?
He's a good guy, or at least he's a reformed guy.
I'm just saying, try to keep an open mind.
And I'm just saying, innocent until proven guilty, right?
Hey!
Look at you.
Hot damn, that you Seeley Booth?
How are you?
Kenny J, he looks good.
Hey, man.
This here is my partner, Agent Aubrey.
Your partner.
Yeah.
I'm guessing this isn't a social call.
I'll tell you what, can we talk over here?
All right, so, um, , listen.
Lola Marshall is dead.
And you think I did it.
We just got to rule you out, Kenny.
That's all.
Actually, we're here to ask you a few questions.
When was the last time you saw Lola?
I don't know, probably when I left Next Step.
We ignored each other.
All right, you grow up the way I did, you get real good at ignoring schmucks.
Still, living in the same house as the woman who got you locked up-- that must have been hard.
Look, uh, you see that?
That's just the one I got for being chill with this guy.
All right, I got no interest in living with my head on a swivel again.
I'll tell you what, all we need is an alibi.
Where were you, uh, two weeks ago, late Friday?
I had to guess, I'd say at home, sleeping.
Watching TV.
Life's pretty boring, now.
So, in other words, you don't have an alibi.
Look, Booth, you know me.
I-I'm no killer.
Look, I'll tell you what, we know how to get in touch with you if we have any more questions, okay?
I got a few quest...
I'm proud of you, Kenny.
Take care of yourself, all right?
Come on.
The hell was that?
He doesn't need an alibi?
Booth, you're too close to this.
Stop, okay?
You saw him.
The guy got stabbed for me.
Yeah, but just because he protected you then, doesn't mean it's right for you to protect him now.
Don't tell me how to do my job, Aubrey.
The guy's a suspect in a murder investigation.
My gut says there's nothing here.
Your gut?
Booth, are you the lead on this case or his friend?
Get in the car.
I'm here, caffeinated and I'm ready to jam on some bones.
Good timing.
Hodgins just gave me his analysis of the burn mark I found.
It's gunshot residue, which means the victim wasn't just beaten, she was shot.
Aubrey tried to kiss me.
Tried to kiss you?
Yeah, it was a weird timing thing.
Um, but, our entire relationship has been a weird timing thing.
Oh, well, I didn't know that it was technically a relationship.
Because of the slowness.
Glaciers move faster.
Um, I mean, I think the feelings are there, but what if it doesn't matter?
What if the physical is just never there?
And then I never have another orgasm, and life is just a futile existence of jumping from one binge-watched show to another.
Wow.
Jessica, Aubrey is crazy about you.
It's obvious.
You think the fact that it's taken you guys months to get to an actual kiss, may have built it up a bit?
It's so frustrating.
I mean, I'm normally the forward one.
Why can't I be here?
Because you're scared.
Maybe you feel differently about him than you have about anyone else.
You know, it's easy to want to run away from things that scare you.
Easier than trying to fight through the complications.
Do you want to talk about things?
Yes.
This gunshot wound.
Until we find what part of the body this tissue is from...
We won't know whether the gunshot wound was fatal.
Exactly.
I'm on it.
Wow.
Oh, my God.
These are incredible.
Each is a piece of my soul.
That's what photography is, Angela.
It's finding the truth, the beauty, where you least expect it.
Yeah, but how do you... how do you know where to look?
You don't.
Not at first, at least.
It calls to me, though.
What does?
Beauty.
Sebastian.
Angela.
- Oh, Angela.
- Angela.
Angela.
Oh.
Hi, what are you... what are you doing here?
I thought you were having a bad dream.
Uh, yeah, I-I was.
I-I-I have not been sleeping well lately.
Anyway, I think I narrowed down where the victim was the day she died.
Great.
Great.
You should...
You should tell Booth and Aubrey.
Yeah, that's where I was heading before I heard you talking in your sleep.
You said his name, you know.
So we know that our victim was somewhere in Northeast Baltimore the day she was killed.
The tower that her cell phone pinged off of, it services this three-mile radius right around here.
I'm a visual person, okay?
I got to be able to see it.
Identifying the problem-- that's half the battle.
I-I found two other anomalies, when I was searching through the sludge, right?
The first one being rock salt.
The stuff that they use to defrost the streets when it snows?
Yeah, that's right.
Now, this type of rock salt, it's composed of sodium chloride and contains traces of cyanide.
Great, so the public service departments are trying to kill us.
Well, unfortunately, due to its toxicity, it's only used in certain poorer neighborhoods, like this one right in here.
That is still a lot of territory to cover.
You still haven't heard the pièce de résistance:
Fresh tar on the victim's shoe treads.
In our narrowed-down area here, of French fry quarter, the only street being re-paved on the day of Lola's murder, was this one here,
Kennison Avenue, right by the Arlington Estate Co-ops.
So what was Lola doing at the Co-ops?
I don't know, man.
That's all you.
I found slight fractures on the inferior surfaces of the carpals.
At first, I thought they were postmortem, maybe even the result of the mudslide she was buried in.
You were mistaken.
Yes.
The inferior surfaces of the carpals and tarsals, are fractured in the same way, indicative of a repeated stress injury over a short period of time.
Suggesting?
Suggesting the victim fought back.
These are defensive wounds.
You are incorrect again, Ms. Warren.
I have seen injuries similar to these in instances where the victim was buried alive.
The fractures are reflective of clawing or kicking her way out of an enclosed space.
Whoa.
This just got way darker and creepier.
Oh, um, I found something else.
Note the slight widening of the victim's pubic symphysis.
The victim has given birth before.
While she was still maturing.
You are speculating that the baby is now old enough to be the killer.
An angry kid abandoned by his mother?
Youknow, it's interesting to me that you didn't even visit or-or speak to your mother the whole time that she was in prison.
She didn't want me, why should I want her?
Anger and resentment are very rational feelings after being abandoned by a parent.
So what?
So those feelings didn't just go away when she moved to the halfway house.
Maybe she tried to look you up, and you couldn't see that she'd changed.
You're bitter, so you lashed out, and you killed her.
You have no idea what you're talking about.
Okay, then what changed?
Why go back and visit her now, after all of these years?
You're sweating, and it's only 70 degrees in here.
You're showing evidence of ptyalism, and your nostrils have begun broadening.
Ptyalism, right.
Except, what does that mean?
She's pregnant.
I'm right, aren't I?
Yes.
I'm three months.
Well, taking care of yourself after aging out of the system is scary enough.
Taking care of a baby on top of that...
Maybe you thought that your mother owed you something.
Then maybe you thought you can get something from her.
Then you found out that she had nothing.
And then you snapped.
You think I killed her?
!
No way!
She said she wanted us to be a family.
She said she wanted to take care of us.
That she had a real job, and that she was gonna break the cycle.
So I said okay.
I wanted that, too.
I didn't kill her.
I let myself believe that I have a future, but, I I'm alone again.
Kalani, you need to tell us if there's anything about your mother's life that may have gotten her killed.
She seemed... excited.
She-she was saving up so that when I turn 18 we could get an apartment together.
We were making plans.
Okay, look, were there any changes in habit here?
Did she have any new acquaintances in her life?
Anything like that?
Uh, the last time I saw her, sh-she was frustrated, because she had to leave early.
Something a-about some friend, some Kenny guy, was waiting in the car for her.
Kenny, Kenny Johnson?
I don't know his last name.
Just that they were at the halfway house together.
Note the slight abrasions on the superior nuchal line.
Damage from the mudslide?
Uh, I do not believe so.
These appear to be perimortem and are inconsistent with any of the other injuries sustained during the victim's murder.
Which is why I want you to swab for trace.
Booth and I spoke with Lola's daughter, Kalani.
The foster kid.
How did that go?
I remember being her age, and having no one to turn to, and having no idea what was coming next.
I recall a feeling of being overtaken, as though, if I forced myself, to think about the future, I would implode.
Angela tell you to talk to me?
No.
But, Dr. Hodgins, you're my friend and my colleague, and I care about you.
Sometimes it doesn't matter if you have the whole world supporting you, success can be just out of reach.
Then success must be redefined as that which can be accomplished.
If Kalani can't have a family with her mother and her child, then she must find an alternative that she can live with.
And if I can't find an alternative?
You have to to survive.
You make a faulty assumption, Dr. Brennan.
Survival doesn't necessarily mean living.
Kenny.
Booth, what's up, man?
What's up is that you lied to me.
Last time I asked you if you saw Lola, and you said it was, like, months.
Now I find out that you saw her the day she disappeared?
Look, you don't know what it's like.
All right, you got out of prison, right back to your cush job.
Me?
To the world, I'm just an ex-con.
Do you know how hard it was for me to get a job with my record?
I mean, they find out I'm involved in an FBI investigation, how long you think they'll let me stay?
And I didn't kill that woman.
Then why didn't you just say you were with her?
You know, back in the day, Lola ran product for me.
All right, best thing you can do right now is tell me something that I don't know.
Kalani's mine.
You and Lola were in a relationship?
No, it was casual, part of the lifestyle.
Of course, she didn't tell me the baby was mine until a month ago.
Wow.
It's not like you guys were on good terms, though.
She was all about giving Kalani a family.
It wasn't about me and her getting together, she just...
I don't know, man, she just wanted Kalani to know she has a dad.
Uh, sounds like to me, that she wanted the three of you to have a second chance.
Well, anyway, I couldn't go through with it.
I mean, look at me, man.
You think I'm a worthy dad?
If I was my dad, I'd run the other way.
All right, so yeah, I stayed in the car.
And then drove Lola back to Next Step.
And that's the last I saw her.
I swear.
I had a sex dream about Sebastian.
And Hodgins knows.
Okay.
Well, um...
Angela, do you intend to cheat on Hodgins with Sebastian?
No.
No.
Except what if part of me wants to?
I mean, I don't, I don't want to cheat on Hodgins.
I love him.
At least, I love the Hodgins that I married.
You believe his injury has damaged him irreparably?
Hasn't it?
It's not even about him not walking.
It's-it's him.
He's different.
He's... distant.
It just... it doesn't feel like a real marriage anymore.
The injury didn't impact Hodgins' spinal reflexes at a sacral level.
He's still sexually capable.
Yeah, everything about him is still capable of it.
It just doesn't make a difference if he's given up.
He can't fix that void, if he doesn't take responsibility for creating it.
I-I-I can't make him change unless he wants to.
And if he never wants to?
The rug in here is a definite match for the fiber Hodgins found in the occipital injury.
So Jasmine and Lola's room could be our crime scene.
Hodgins also found trace of brass.
Uh, maybe from what she was beaten with?
Hey, um, so should we talk?
You mean, instead of awkwardly avoiding the pink elephant in the room?
Yeah, something like that.
Then, no.
Uh, not now.
Let's get through this case.
This looks like brass.
It's not working.
It's got a broken bulb in it.
For a lamp that's not working, this one sure is lighting up like a Christmas tree.
Blood?
Definitely.
What the hell are y'all doing in my room?
This here's private property.
Jasmine Santangelo, you're under arrest for the murder of your roommate,
Lola Marshall.
Man, hell no... what the...
Aubrey.
Got something else.
You gonna deny that those drugs belong to you, too?
I didn't think so.
Let's go.
Found over a half kilo of Wiley Monkey in your room, Jasmine.
You can't prove that's mine.
Shouldn't be hard to convince a jury that a killer, fresh out of jail, got involved in the drug trade and another murder.
I didn't mean to kill my stepdad.
I just wanted him to leave me alone and stop touching me, and I swear I didn't kill Lola.
Here's how it went down in my head.
She found your stash, threatened to turn you in, so you beat her to death with that lamp.
Man, I didn't even know she was dead until y'all FBI agents showed up at Next Step.
I liked Lola.
She was good to me.
I didn't hurt her.
Somebody did.
Maybe your supplier found out that she knew your little secret.
Jasmine, listen to me.
I want to believe you, but you've got to give me something to go on here.
I can't.
It doesn't matter if I talk.
Either you'll throw me back in prison, or he will kill me.
He who?
I can't tell you.
I can't.
Ms. Warren.
Please take a look at the posterior surfaces of the left third through fifth vertebral ribs.
Now, run your finger along the damage.
It feels like pitting.
I don't understand.
How does this help us find the path of the bullet?
It doesn't.
This pitting is not the direct result of the bullet wound.
So how does that help us?
Have Dr. Hodgins swab for trace.
I need to find Angela.
So the victim was leaning up against something, like a wall?
Based on the severity of the blunt force trauma,
I would postulate that it's much more likely that at least initially, she was lying down, near unconsciousness.
Now, I believe when the bullet passed through her body, it hit the surface she was lying on, causing debris to blow back into her ribs.
Debris that was hard enough to cause pitting on the bones.
Got something for you.
Dr. Hodgins.
Do you have the results of your swabs of the injuries?
Yeah, I ran them through microspectrophotometry, and found traces of steel and also carpet fiber.
It's a polyester and polyolefin blend, like what you'd find in the trunk of a car.
Angela, now place the victim inside the trunk of a car.
The amount of damage caused by the beating suggests the killer presumed Lola was dead when he placed her in the vehicle.
You think she regained consciousness and tried to claw her way out as he was driving.
Then when the killer reached the dumpsite, he found she was still alive, and he shot her.
The bullet hit the bottom of the trunk with enough force to cause the blowback which ricocheted into her body.
Dr. Hodgins, can you determine the kind of car based on the carpet fibers and the metal alloy?
Uh, yeah, actually, I already did.
Mazda, BMW, Ford Mustang and Fusion.
Wait, BMW?
There was a BMW at the halfway house.
Uh, I'll notify Booth and Aubrey.
I-I already told you guys everything I know.
No.
We think you might have left out a few details.
Such as the fact that you're the murderer.
That's bull.
I mean, you don't have any proof.
Lola discovered Jasmine was working for you.
She refused to participate in your scam, didn't she?
Maybe she even threatened to turn you in?
You couldn't stand for that, so you beat her, and you threw her in your car.
When you saw she was still alive, you shot her.
That's a great story.
Great story.
I don't know who's gonna believe you.
I-I-I'm a public servant.
I have years of experience.
But our lab can tie Lola's body and injuries directly to your car.
We have indisputable physical evidence, Mr. Hemingway.
Was it so wrong wanting to make a little something on the side?
You know, do something for myself for once.
I mean, half those fools, they'd be back in the lifestyle with or without me.
I bet they can't wait to see you on the other side of the bars.
Okay, you can't send me there.
They'll kill me.
Relax, Thomas.
I'm sure they'll show you the same kindness that you showed them.
You ready to go home?
Yes, but not with you.
Okay, look, if this is about the dream, then I think that we...
This has nothing to do with your dream, Angela.
What is this?
That's everything.
It's all my money, property, and it's all yours.
Whoa, wait, um, I'm sorry.
I... this feels like, um, are you trying to...
We're broken.
And it's my fault, because I am... miserable.
And what's worse is
I'm making you miserable.
So change.
I know that this is painful for you, and I know that you think that I couldn't possibly understand what it's like.
But this is life.
It's hard, and it is painful, and it is every day.
But we fight.
We fight together.
This is my decision.
No, this is a coward's decision.
I am not letting you make it.
I don't care about any of the stuff in this folder.
I need you.
See you at home.

Aw, thanks, boyfriend.
I mean, my friend who is a boy.
Attaboy, Aubrey.
So, I, uh, want to kiss you.
Uh, do you think maybe it means something that you haven't yet, that we haven't...
No, it's my fault.
I mean, I built it up in my head, and now it's like this big T. Rex.
Big with short arms?
Yeah, it's-it's scary.
Yeah, I get that, um.
Yeah, but, um, uh, I'm not in a rush.
Are you?
I mean, normally, I'm really good at this kind of thing.
You know what that tells me?
That what you and I have isn't normal.
It's more special than that.
See you tomorrow?
Count on it.
Jessica!
I take full responsibility for my aggressive actions against Paul Walters, and I am prepared to accept the punishment that fits the crime.
Agent Booth, are you in agreement with your partner's assessment of the situation in question?
Completely.
And you are convinced that such actions will not be repeated in the future?
You see, Dr. Brennan represents this Bureau and its values more than any agent that I have ever worked with.
I mean, sh-she made a mistake.
Look, we all do.
And we all are gonna make mistakes in the future, and we should be able to make those mistakes.
We should be able to learn from them, grow from them, and be given a second chance.
I mean, will Bones here ever punch anyone again?
I-I-I can't say, but you should give her a chance to try.
You want this committee to forego punishment so Dr. Brennan can try not to hit people?
I will not be trying;
I will succeed.
I have no doubt you will.
With Agent Booth's help.
Exactly.
I'm sorry?
Dr. Brennan, this committee is placing you on six month's probation, to be overseen by Agent Booth.
A failure on your part will be considered a failure on his part.
We'll take it.
No, no.
Agent Booth didn't do anything wrong.
He should not be held accountable for my actions.
It doesn't matter because you're not going to do it again, right?
That's not the point.
It is the point.
You're... you are gonna do it again?
No.
Booth.
What?
Has a decision been made here?
Can you just give me one second?
Clearly not the point.
The point is, that you're not gonna hit anyone again, right?
That's not the point.
She's not... she's not going to hit anyone ever again.
- We accept.
- We're not accepting.
- We accept.
- No.
We are not...
- Not gonna take that.
- That's fine, yes, we'll take that.
What's that mean?
BOOTH:
Bones, you sure you don't want to run over your testimony for the morning?
No need.
I'm fully prepared.
Just so you know,
I'm hearing talk of suspension, possible anger management classes.
Both a waste of my time and the FBI's resources.
Bones, you know what?
You punched a suspect.
After that misogynist...
Meninist.
Same thing.
He told you to put a muzzle on me.
He's lucky all I did was punch him.
All right, just so you know, that the, uh, the Bureau is very big on accountability and remorse.
But I'm not sorry for my actions.
Uh-uh.
They don't need to know that.
You're making this a much larger deal than it needs to be, Booth.
So there's no scenario where you-you could take my advice.
Not off the top of my head, unlikely.
Okay, I got it.
What if I do that thing, huh?
That thing that you like.
That you wrote about, uh, in your book on page 187.
Bam.
Well, as much as I typically enjoy the thing on page 187,
I'm not currently in the mood for that particular thing.
Ah, here's a good one. 92.
The thing that you talk about on 92.
You love that.
That involves a jump.
92.
I'm not sure, but, um...
I'll wear the rabbit ears.
I might be persuaded to take your advice for the thing on page 214.
214.
What's 214?
Ah.
Very tribal.
We are in like Flynn.
214.
I will prepare the deck.
I'll grab the masks.
(drumming and screeching)
Is it possible that we just watched seven Star Wars movies in a row?
Well, the extreme pain in my lower back is making me believe that it is.
(chuckles) I told you you should have done those stretches with me.
Eh, I don't know, you know.
The bridges and the splitsy things, that just doesn't come as naturally to me as it does to you.
Well, fair enough.
You know, my yoga coach has mentioned that I have very open hips.
Oh, yeah?
Mm-hmm.
Yoga dude gettin' a little handsy?
Is that jealousy I sense?
Why would I be jealous?
It's not like you and I are...
No, I mean, of course not.
I mean, I would.
You would?
Would you?
Right now?
It feels like a moment.
And we've already let so many other moments pass by.
Oh!
Oh, oh.
Oh!
Oh, wow, are you okay?
Yeah, no, super, super okay.
(phone rings)
(sighs) It's a dead body.
Wow.
Nothing says romantic like having your first kiss interrupted by murder.
Or dirty street water.
(sighs)
WARREN:
This is pretty gnarly.
SAROYAN:
Yeah, the victim was discovered by road crews cleaning up a mudslide near Baltimore.
Was that cause of death?
I don't think so.
The decomp's pretty advanced, but the mudslide sure did a hell of a job on the remains.
Yeah, you're telling me.
Check out all these fractures on the X-rays.
That slide was one bumpy toboggan ride.
Uh, the slightly raised ridge across the central surface of the pubis, plus the anteriorly-positioned mandible tell me the victim is female.
And the receding zygomatics and wear on the dentition suggest that the victim is of Negroid descent and in her early 30s.
Presence of hairy maggot blowfly larvae suggests the victim was buried in a shallow grave, approximately two weeks before the mudslide.
SAROYAN:
That tracks with the vitreous humor in the remaining eyeball.
Hey, honey, is your shoulder okay?
Hey, what time is Brennan's hearing?
WARREN:
Wait, hearing?
What hearing?
I think it's going on right now.
Brennan punched a suspect.
That's a big no-no at the FBI.
Go, Dr. B.
I knew there was a reason she's my hero.
Yeah, well, I think it's got her into a bit of trouble now.
Oh, come on.
She's so good at her job, what could they possibly do to her?
WOMAN:
Dr. Brennan,
I'm not sure you understand the severity of the situation.
You assaulted a suspect.
The FBI does not take that lightly.
Nonsense.
Between the years 1993 and 2011, FBI agents either injured or killed 150 people using firearms.
Your internal investigations let each of those agents off without a charge.
You punched an unarmed man.
And he deserved it.
You seem to believe that that excuses your actions.
That is correct.
I have no more questions at this moment.
Tomorrow, we speak to your partner.
If his testimony goes anything like yours, Dr. Brennan, you will no longer be allowed to work with the Bureau.
The panel is adjourned until tomorrow.

MONTENEGRO:
Hey.
How did the hearing go?
There seems to be a divide in our mutual understanding of what occurred between Mr. Walters and myself.
You're saying you didn't punch him?
Not at all.
I merely argued that I should not be held accountable.
(laughs) Bet they loved that.
Unfortunately, I believe it had the opposite effect.
Uh, maybe we should get back to the case.
Hmm.
Damage to the heart muscle indicates significant endocarditis.
Heart disease?
Actually, it looks more like the kind of damage
I see on drug addicts.
I'll run a tox screen.
Ms. Warren, what do you see regarding the surgical rod in the victim's right femur?
Remodeling?
I'm referring to the rod itself.
There are no nails to hold it in place.
This kind of surgical rod has not been used in most orthopedic surgical centers in decades.
The injury's that old?
Well, not according to the remodeling, which appears to be approximately four years old.
Why was a recent injury treated with such outdated equipment?
It's unclear.
However, it should be easy to track the rod itself, given its uncommon nature.
An injury that bad, she must have been laid up for months.
That's got to suck.
Well, at least she walked again.
BRENNAN:
Yes.
I don't believe the injury caused any lasting damage.
No, I think that was about Hodgins.
WARREN:
Uh, not to be too nosy, but you guys do seem a little...
Cold?
Distant?
Or maybe the part where he takes all of his crap out on me?
Is it truly that bad?
I don't think it can get much worse.
Honestly, he's pushing me away.
Yeah, I did see that whole hand to the shoulder shrug-off thing.
Well, that's just par for the course these days.
Oh, here we go.
Got it.
All right.
Now you can go get an ID.
Uh, but you don't have to go right now, 'cause, you know, we're talking.
It's okay.
I, uh, I should stay busy.
BOOTH:
You missed?
(chuckles) Wow.
You've never kissed a girl before, Aubrey?
What?
No, of course I have.
Lots of times.
It's just... have you ever tried to do something, but the timing was just all off?
You know what?
The timing's off now.
Let's just get back to the case, all right?
All right.
Okay.
Well, the body dump was in a pretty isolated area.
Not a lot of people around there.
Yeah, but if you go three miles straight into Baltimore, you're gonna be smack right in the middle of Perkins Homes.
Gangland.
So what, you thinking drugs?
That tracks with the heart damage that Cam found.
You ever hear of a drug called a Wiley Monkey?
Any relation to the coyote?
Anyhow, it's a, uh, big drug now in, uh, Southeast, uh, Baltimore.
It has, what, cocaine, heroin, household cleaning products in it.
Did you tell Cam?
Well, I was going to until you came in here crying about all your girl problems.
(scoffs) I'm not crying.
I just, I thought, you know, maybe you could give me some words of advice, if you have any.
Okay, look, Aubrey.
You know what?
There's, you know, the first kiss is always awkward.
There's lots of awkward moments.
I mean, Bones and I, we had, uh, we had many awkward moments.
Yeah, but now you're happily married.
Yeah, but we wouldn't have been happily married if we gave up after that first awkward moment.
Angela, these are spectacular.
Really?
A true improvement.
Uh, you can sit down.
It's just, uh, next time can we meet at my studio?
Oh, yeah.
In-instead of here?
It'd be more private.
Oh, your studio is Cam-free, right?
Oh, uh... (stammering) don't-don't let me interrupt.
No, no, no, no.
No interruption.
I'm actually heading out the door.
Set for next time?
Yeah.
That was weird.
Yeah.
So, what's set for next time?
Oh, just where we're gonna meet up so we can go over these photos.
What's up?
My initial tox screen came back negative, so I tested some adipose tissue.
I'm pretty sure the victim was drug-free for about a decade.
I think I might know why she stopped using.
So, the only facility in the area that still uses those outdated surgical rods is a hospital in West Virginia.
The facility primarily treats inmates from the local penitentiary.
So the victim was Lola Marshall, 32.
She served 10 years for dealing crack.
Wait, does that say "fugitive?"
Yeah.
She was released from prison to the halfway house in January.
But she disappeared from there two weeks ago.
That's when the warrant went out for her rearrest.
I imagine the residents of this neighborhood would be quite displeased to have criminals living among them.
(sighs) It's definitely not the suburban dream.
You must be Agent Aubrey and Dr. Brennan.
Thomas Hemingway.
You the owner of this halfway house Mr. Hemingway?
Thomas, and yes, uh, I've owned and operated
Next Step for nearly seven years now.
Hey, Louis.
30 minutes late for curfew last night.
The bus ran late.
You should have called.
You know the rules.
I'm gonna have to write you up.
And you know what happens next time.
What happens next time?
I have to send him back.
I have a responsibility to both these inmates and the community.
It means making a lot of tough choices.
Come on inside.
Through this doorway is our group therapy room.
And, uh, was Lola involved in group therapy as well?
Certainly, yeah.
We-we focus on coping mechanisms in high-stress environments.
Mock interviews, conflict resolution.
And how did Lola do with that?
Well, actually.
Uh, she got a job almost immediately.
Donuts R Us. (chuckles)
Yeah, she was a model inmate.
Never missed curfew, until, uh...
Until she disappeared.
Yeah.
You think Lola might have returned to her old lifestyle, don't you?
I hope not, but...
I couldn't say.
Okay, well, who could?
Lola's roommate, Jasmine.
Uh, if anyone would know, it's her.
You had been Lola's roommate since January-- you two must have been close.
Did she tell you where she was going the night she disappeared?
Mm-mm.
Like you said, me and Lola were pretty tight.
If she was planning on leaving, she would have told me.
Did she ever tell you about her life before prison?
(chuckles) You mean her slinging dope in the projects?
Yeah.
So do you think it's possible that Lola went back to selling drugs?
No.
(sighs) She told me this story.
Like, four years ago in prison,
White Angels of Mercy beat the black off her one day in the showers.
What does that have to do with Lola's recidivism?
Uh, she was in the infirmary for months, bored out of her skull.
That's when she got her GED, turned her stuff around.
No way she worked that hard just to give it all up.
Was there anyone she didn't get along with?
There was this chump, Kenny J.
He bounced out after her first two weeks, though.
What did Kenny have against her?
Kenny was Lola's supplier.
She turned state's on him for a reduced sentence.
Okay, did Kenny have a last name?
Johnson.
You know this guy, Booth?
Um, thanks, um,
Kenny and I, we were in prison together.
SAROYAN:
You have something to show me, Ms. Warren?
Oh, Dr. Saroyan, yes.
Um, as I was re-articulating,
I noticed extensive fractures on the ribs, skull and scapulae.
The severity makes me think the victim was beaten with some kind of blunt weapon.
Repeated strikes indicate a crime of passion, so this wasn't premeditated.
Exactly.
The killer was probably super pissed.
I'm vibing we've got cause of death, but I think Dr. B's gonna want more than that.
Let me know when you have a definitive answer on cause of death.
HODGINS:
You do not need my permission to do what you want to do, Angela.
I'm not asking your permission.
I...
Can't we even just talk about anything anymore?
I just wanted to know your opinion.
You want to go spend time with Sebastian in his studio.
I support you.
Then why does it sound like you hate the idea?
Forget how I sound.
You do you, I'll do me.
That's not how marriage works.
At least, that's not how our marriage works.
Well, things change.
Uh, sorry.
I'll come back.
No, no, Cam.
Your timing is perfect.
Sure?
Yeah, we... uh... we're fine.
We're done talking, or whatever you want to call what we were just doing.
Okay.
Hodgins, I wanted you to take a look at this tissue.
It looks like burn marks, but I haven't seen any other signs of burning in the sludge.
Neither did I on the remains.
Okay, all right.
Just leave this with me.
I'll test it for particulates and figure out what left such an isolated mark.
Thanks.
I'm just gonna...
Me, too.
BOOTH:
I met Kenny in prison, before they dropped the charges against me.
The guy's got one hell of a record.
Seems kind of dangerous.
Okay, Kenny was the only guy in there who had my back.
It's not easy being friends with a cop.
That's fair enough, but Baltimore PD has him listed as a known suspect in at least two murders.
Rumors.
Nothing else.
Why are you protecting this guy?
I told you.
I know him, all right?
He's a good guy, or at least he's a reformed guy.
I'm just saying, try to keep an open mind.
And I'm just saying, innocent until proven guilty, right?
Hey!
Look at you.
Hot damn, that you Seeley Booth?
How are you?
Kenny J, he looks good.
Hey, man.
This here is my partner, Agent Aubrey.
Your partner.
Yeah.
I'm guessing this isn't a social call.
I'll tell you what, can we talk over here?
All right, so, um, (clears throat), listen.
Lola Marshall is dead.
And you think I did it.
We just got to rule you out, Kenny.
That's all.
Actually, we're here to ask you a few questions.
When was the last time you saw Lola?
I don't know, probably when I left Next Step.
We ignored each other.
All right, you grow up the way I did, you get real good at ignoring schmucks.
Still, living in the same house as the woman who got you locked up-- that must have been hard.
Look, uh, you see that?
That's just the one I got for being chill with this guy.
All right, I got no interest in living with my head on a swivel again.
I'll tell you what, all we need is an alibi.
Where were you, uh, two weeks ago, late Friday?
I had to guess, I'd say at home, sleeping.
Watching TV.
Life's pretty boring, now.
So, in other words, you don't have an alibi.
Look, Booth, you know me.
I-I'm no killer.
Look, I'll tell you what, we know how to get in touch with you if we have any more questions, okay?
I got a few quest...
I'm proud of you, Kenny.
Take care of yourself, all right?
Come on.
The hell was that?
He doesn't need an alibi?
Booth, you're too close to this.
Stop, okay?
You saw him.
The guy got stabbed for me.
Yeah, but just because he protected you then, doesn't mean it's right for you to protect him now.
Don't tell me how to do my job, Aubrey.
The guy's a suspect in a murder investigation.
My gut says there's nothing here.
Your gut?
Booth, are you the lead on this case or his friend?
Get in the car.
I'm here, caffeinated and I'm ready to jam on some bones.
Good timing.
Hodgins just gave me his analysis of the burn mark I found.
It's gunshot residue, which means the victim wasn't just beaten, she was shot.
Aubrey tried to kiss me.
Tried to kiss you?
Yeah, it was a weird timing thing.
Um, but, our entire relationship has been a weird timing thing.
Oh, well, I didn't know that it was technically a relationship.
Because of the slowness.
Glaciers move faster.
Um, I mean, I think the feelings are there, but what if it doesn't matter?
What if the physical is just never there?
And then I never have another orgasm, and life is just a futile existence of jumping from one binge-watched show to another.
Wow.
Jessica, Aubrey is crazy about you.
It's obvious.
You think the fact that it's taken you guys months to get to an actual kiss, may have built it up a bit?
(sighs)
It's so frustrating.
I mean, I'm normally the forward one.
Why can't I be here?
Because you're scared.
Maybe you feel differently about him than you have about anyone else.
You know, it's easy to want to run away from things that scare you.
Easier than trying to fight through the complications.
Do you want to talk about things?
Yes.
This gunshot wound.
Until we find what part of the body this tissue is from...
We won't know whether the gunshot wound was fatal.
Exactly.
I'm on it.
Wow.
Oh, my God.
These are incredible.
Each is a piece of my soul.
That's what photography is, Angela.
It's finding the truth, the beauty, where you least expect it.
Yeah, but how do you... how do you know where to look?
You don't.
Not at first, at least.
It calls to me, though.
What does?
Beauty.
Sebastian.
Angela.
Oh, Angela.
HODGINS:
Angela.
Angela.
Oh.
Hi, what are you... what are you doing here?
I thought you were having a bad dream.
Uh, yeah, I-I was.
I-I-I have not been sleeping well lately.
Anyway, I think I narrowed down where the victim was the day she died.
Great.
Great.
You should...
You should tell Booth and Aubrey.
Yeah, that's where I was heading before I heard you talking in your sleep.
You said his name, you know.
AUBREY:
So we know that our victim was somewhere in Northeast Baltimore the day she was killed.
The tower that her cell phone pinged off of, it services this three-mile radius right around here.
I'm a visual person, okay?
I got to be able to see it.
Identifying the problem-- that's half the battle.
I-I found two other anomalies, when I was searching through the sludge, right?
The first one being rock salt.
The stuff that they use to defrost the streets when it snows?
Yeah, that's right.
Now, this type of rock salt, it's composed of sodium chloride and contains traces of cyanide.
Great, so the public service departments are trying to kill us.
Well, unfortunately, due to its toxicity, it's only used in certain poorer neighborhoods, like this one right in here.
That is still a lot of territory to cover.
You still haven't heard the pièce de résistance:
Fresh tar on the victim's shoe treads.
In our narrowed-down area here, of French fry quarter, the only street being re-paved on the day of Lola's murder, was this one here,
Kennison Avenue, right by the Arlington Estate Co-ops.
So what was Lola doing at the Co-ops?
I don't know, man.
That's all you.
I found slight fractures on the inferior surfaces of the carpals.
At first, I thought they were postmortem, maybe even the result of the mudslide she was buried in.
You were mistaken.
Yes.
The inferior surfaces of the carpals and tarsals, are fractured in the same way, indicative of a repeated stress injury over a short period of time.
Suggesting?
Suggesting the victim fought back.
These are defensive wounds.
You are incorrect again, Ms. Warren.
I have seen injuries similar to these in instances where the victim was buried alive.
The fractures are reflective of clawing or kicking her way out of an enclosed space.
Whoa.
This just got way darker and creepier.
Oh, um, I found something else.
Note the slight widening of the victim's pubic symphysis.
The victim has given birth before.
While she was still maturing.
You are speculating that the baby is now old enough to be the killer.
An angry kid abandoned by his mother?
BOOTH:
You know, it's interesting to me that you didn't even visit or-or speak to your mother the whole time that she was in prison.
She didn't want me, why should I want her?
Anger and resentment are very rational feelings after being abandoned by a parent.
So what?
So those feelings didn't just go away when she moved to the halfway house.
Maybe she tried to look you up, and you couldn't see that she'd changed.
You're bitter, so you lashed out, and you killed her.
You have no idea what you're talking about.
Okay, then what changed?
Why go back and visit her now, after all of these years?
You're sweating, and it's only 70 degrees in here.
You're showing evidence of ptyalism, and your nostrils have begun broadening.
Ptyalism, right.
Except, what does that mean?
She's pregnant.
I'm right, aren't I?
Yes.
I'm three months.
Well, taking care of yourself after aging out of the system is scary enough.
Taking care of a baby on top of that...
Maybe you thought that your mother owed you something.
Then maybe you thought you can get something from her.
Then you found out that she had nothing.
And then you snapped.
You think I killed her?
!
No way!
She said she wanted us to be a family.
She said she wanted to take care of us.
That she had a real job, and that she was gonna break the cycle.
So I said okay.
(crying):
I wanted that, too.
I didn't kill her.
I let myself believe that I have a future, but, I I'm alone again.
Kalani, you need to tell us if there's anything about your mother's life that may have gotten her killed.
She seemed... excited.
She-she was saving up so that when I turn 18 we could get an apartment together.
We were making plans.
Okay, look, were there any changes in habit here?
Did she have any new acquaintances in her life?
Anything like that?
Uh, the last time I saw her, sh-she was frustrated, because she had to leave early.
Something a-about some friend, some Kenny guy, was waiting in the car for her.
Kenny, Kenny Johnson?
I don't know his last name.
Just that they were at the halfway house together.
Note the slight abrasions on the superior nuchal line.
Damage from the mudslide?
Uh, I do not believe so.
These appear to be perimortem and are inconsistent with any of the other injuries sustained during the victim's murder.
Which is why I want you to swab for trace.
Booth and I spoke with Lola's daughter, Kalani.
The foster kid.
How did that go?
I remember being her age, and having no one to turn to, and having no idea what was coming next.
I recall a feeling of being overtaken, as though, if I forced myself, to think about the future, I would implode.
Angela tell you to talk to me?
No.
But, Dr. Hodgins, you're my friend and my colleague, and I care about you.
Sometimes it doesn't matter if you have the whole world supporting you, success can be just out of reach.
Then success must be redefined as that which can be accomplished.
If Kalani can't have a family with her mother and her child, then she must find an alternative that she can live with.
And if I can't find an alternative?
You have to to survive.
You make a faulty assumption, Dr. Brennan.
Survival doesn't necessarily mean living.
BOOTH:
Kenny.
Booth, what's up, man?
What's up is that you lied to me.
Last time I asked you if you saw Lola, and you said it was, like, months.
Now I find out that you saw her the day she disappeared?
Look, you don't know what it's like.
All right, you got out of prison, right back to your cush job.
Me?
To the world, I'm just an ex-con.
Do you know how hard it was for me to get a job with my record?
I mean, they find out I'm involved in an FBI investigation, how long you think they'll let me stay?
And I didn't kill that woman.
Then why didn't you just say you were with her?
You know, back in the day, Lola ran product for me.
All right, best thing you can do right now is tell me something that I don't know.
Kalani's mine.
You and Lola were in a relationship?
No, it was casual, part of the lifestyle.
Of course, she didn't tell me the baby was mine until a month ago.
Wow.
It's not like you guys were on good terms, though.
She was all about giving Kalani a family.
It wasn't about me and her getting together, she just...
I don't know, man, she just wanted Kalani to know she has a dad.
Uh, sounds like to me, that she wanted the three of you to have a second chance.
Well, anyway, I couldn't go through with it.
I mean, look at me, man.
You think I'm a worthy dad?
If I was my dad, I'd run the other way.
All right, so yeah, I stayed in the car.
And then drove Lola back to Next Step.
And that's the last I saw her.
I swear.
I had a sex dream about Sebastian.
(sighs) And Hodgins knows.
Okay.
Well, um...
Angela, do you intend to cheat on Hodgins with Sebastian?
No.
No.
Except what if part of me wants to?
I mean, I don't, I don't want to cheat on Hodgins.
I love him.
At least, I love the Hodgins that I married.
You believe his injury has damaged him irreparably?
Hasn't it?
It's not even about him not walking.
It's-it's him.
He's different.
He's... distant.
It just... it doesn't feel like a real marriage anymore.
The injury didn't impact Hodgins' spinal reflexes at a sacral level.
He's still sexually capable.
Yeah, everything about him is still capable of it.
It just doesn't make a difference if he's given up.
He can't fix that void, if he doesn't take responsibility for creating it.
I-I-I can't make him change unless he wants to.
And if he never wants to?
WARREN:
The rug in here is a definite match for the fiber Hodgins found in the occipital injury.
So Jasmine and Lola's room could be our crime scene.
Hodgins also found trace of brass.
Uh, maybe from what she was beaten with?
Hey, um, so should we talk?
You mean, instead of awkwardly avoiding the pink elephant in the room?
Yeah, something like that.
Then, no.
Uh, not now.
Let's get through this case.
This looks like brass.
It's not working.
It's got a broken bulb in it.
For a lamp that's not working, this one sure is lighting up like a Christmas tree.
Blood?
Definitely.
What the hell are y'all doing in my room?
This here's private property.
Jasmine Santangelo, you're under arrest for the murder of your roommate,
Lola Marshall.
Man, hell no... what the...
Aubrey.
Got something else.
(sighs) You gonna deny that those drugs belong to you, too?
I didn't think so.
Let's go.
Found over a half kilo of Wiley Monkey in your room, Jasmine.
You can't prove that's mine.
Shouldn't be hard to convince a jury that a killer, fresh out of jail, got involved in the drug trade and another murder.
I didn't mean to kill my stepdad.
I just wanted him to leave me alone and stop touching me, and I swear I didn't kill Lola.
Here's how it went down in my head.
She found your stash, threatened to turn you in, so you beat her to death with that lamp.
Man, I didn't even know she was dead until y'all FBI agents showed up at Next Step.
I liked Lola.
She was good to me.
I didn't hurt her.
Somebody did.
Maybe your supplier found out that she knew your little secret.
Jasmine, listen to me.
I want to believe you, but you've got to give me something to go on here.
I can't.
It doesn't matter if I talk.
Either you'll throw me back in prison, or he will kill me.
He who?
I can't tell you.
I can't.
BRENNAN:
Ms. Warren.
Please take a look at the posterior surfaces of the left third through fifth vertebral ribs.
Now, run your finger along the damage.
It feels like pitting.
I don't understand.
How does this help us find the path of the bullet?
It doesn't.
This pitting is not the direct result of the bullet wound.
So how does that help us?
Have Dr. Hodgins swab for trace.
I need to find Angela.
MONTENEGRO:
So the victim was leaning up against something, like a wall?
Based on the severity of the blunt force trauma,
I would postulate that it's much more likely that at least initially, she was lying down, near unconsciousness.
Now, I believe when the bullet passed through her body, it hit the surface she was lying on, causing debris to blow back into her ribs.
Debris that was hard enough to cause pitting on the bones.
Got something for you.
Dr. Hodgins.
Do you have the results of your swabs of the injuries?
Yeah, I ran them through microspectrophotometry, and found traces of steel and also carpet fiber.
It's a polyester and polyolefin blend, like what you'd find in the trunk of a car.
Angela, now place the victim inside the trunk of a car.
The amount of damage caused by the beating suggests the killer presumed Lola was dead when he placed her in the vehicle.
You think she regained consciousness and tried to claw her way out as he was driving.
BRENNAN:
Then when the killer reached the dumpsite, he found she was still alive, and he shot her.
HODGINS:
The bullet hit the bottom of the trunk with enough force to cause the blowback which ricocheted into her body.
Dr. Hodgins, can you determine the kind of car based on the carpet fibers and the metal alloy?
Uh, yeah, actually, I already did.
Mazda, BMW, Ford Mustang and Fusion.
Wait, BMW?
There was a BMW at the halfway house.
Uh, I'll notify Booth and Aubrey.
I-I already told you guys everything I know.
No.
We think you might have left out a few details.
Such as the fact that you're the murderer.
(laughs)
That's bull.
I mean, you don't have any proof.
Lola discovered Jasmine was working for you.
She refused to participate in your scam, didn't she?
Maybe she even threatened to turn you in?
You couldn't stand for that, so you beat her, and you threw her in your car.
When you saw she was still alive, you shot her.
That's a great story.
Great story.
I don't know who's gonna believe you.
I-I-I'm a public servant.
I have years of experience.
But our lab can tie Lola's body and injuries directly to your car.
We have indisputable physical evidence, Mr. Hemingway.
Was it so wrong wanting to make a little something on the side?
You know, do something for myself for once.
I mean, half those fools, they'd be back in the lifestyle with or without me.
I bet they can't wait to see you on the other side of the bars.
Okay, you can't send me there.
They'll kill me.
Relax, Thomas.
I'm sure they'll show you the same kindness that you showed them.
You ready to go home?
Yes, but not with you.
Okay, look, if this is about the dream, then I think that we...
This has nothing to do with your dream, Angela.
What is this?
That's everything.
It's all my money, property, and it's all yours.
Whoa, wait, um, I'm sorry.
I... this feels like, um, are you trying to...
We're broken.
And it's my fault, because I am... miserable.
And what's worse is
I'm making you miserable.
So change.
I know that this is painful for you, and I know that you think that I couldn't possibly understand what it's like.
But this is life.
It's hard, and it is painful, and it is every day.
But we fight.
We fight together.
This is my decision.
No, this is a coward's decision.
I am not letting you make it.
I don't care about any of the stuff in this folder.
I need you.
See you at home.

BRENNAN:
It's a beautiful thing you've done for them, Booth.

They both do.

Attaboy, Aubrey.
So, I, uh, want to kiss you.
Uh, do you think maybe it means something that you haven't yet, that we haven't...
No, it's my fault.
I mean, I built it up in my head, and now it's like this big T. Rex.
Big with short arms?
Yeah, it's-it's scary.
Yeah, I get that, um.
Yeah, but, um, uh, I'm not in a rush.
Are you?
I mean, normally, I'm really good at this kind of thing.
You know what that tells me?
That what you and I have isn't normal.
It's more special than that.
(chuckles)
See you tomorrow?
Count on it.
(tires squealing)
Jessica!
I take full responsibility for my aggressive actions against Paul Walters, and I am prepared to accept the punishment that fits the crime.
Agent Booth, are you in agreement with your partner's assessment of the situation in question?
Completely.
And you are convinced that such actions will not be repeated in the future?
You see, Dr. Brennan represents this Bureau and its values more than any agent that I have ever worked with.
I mean, sh-she made a mistake.
Look, we all do.
And we all are gonna make mistakes in the future, and we should be able to make those mistakes.
We should be able to learn from them, grow from them, and be given a second chance.
I mean, will Bones here ever punch anyone again?
I-I-I can't say, but you should give her a chance to try.
You want this committee to forego punishment so Dr. Brennan can try not to hit people?
I will not be trying;
I will succeed.
I have no doubt you will.
With Agent Booth's help.
Exactly.
I'm sorry?
Dr. Brennan, this committee is placing you on six month's probation, to be overseen by Agent Booth.
A failure on your part will be considered a failure on his part.
We'll take it.
No, no.
Agent Booth didn't do anything wrong.
He should not be held accountable for my actions.
It doesn't matter because you're not going to do it again, right?
That's not the point.
It is the point.
You're... you are gonna do it again?
No.
Booth.
What?
Has a decision been made here?
Can you just give me one second?
Clearly not the point.
The point is, that you're not gonna hit anyone again, right?
That's not the point.
She's not... she's not going to hit anyone ever again.
- We accept.
- We're not accepting.
- We accept.
- No.
We are not...
- Not gonna take that.
- That's fine, yes, we'll take that.
What's that mean?
Sir, we're ready.
MILITARY SECTOR, BUENOS AIRES AIRPORT
- JUNE, 1977
Up!
Go on!
Walk!
No!
Up!
Now!
Get inside, now!
Here we are again in another shithole.
- Like all the destinations you've had.
- Please shut up, Emilce.
COLONIA ELENA INN
Good morning!
- Good morning.
- Hello.
Good morning.
- I need to make a call to Buenos Aires.
- Of course, there's the phone.
- Yes, please.
- Go ahead.
- Here.
- Thanks, Anselmo.
Do I owe you anything?
- No, it's paid for.
- OK.
- Could you sign here?
- Sure.
Thank you.
Goodbye.
Good morning, Rogelio.
Sorry to bother you at home.
I guess you already know...
Yes.
Yes, yes.
That's how it happened.
Of course I want to go back.
I'm just about to retire.
I know, but I thought that maybe you...
I understand, sir.
No.
I won't do that.
Definitely, no.
I'm really surprised.
I thought you'd say something else.
Then we have the same problem.
I also have my limits.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
- How much is it?
-100 pesos for three minutes.
Here.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- Do you remember what you have to do?
- I'll ask them about you.
You said goodbye, went to work, and never came back, nor called.
- And I'm very worried.
- Yes.
They'll ask you lots of questions to try and find me.
Mention all my destinations you know.
They don't know about this place or about my friendship with Alberto.
There is no way they will get here, OK?
What?
Do you want to say something?
- It's nothing.
- Come on, say it.
What a sad ending.
Yes.
Yes.
Constatino will call you.
Don't trust him.
No matter what he or his wife says.
I'm worried about you, not just me.
I don't want him to bother you.
Understand?
Take care, Tomés.
Yes,you too.
Hi!
I'm a friend of Alberto's.
I'll wait for him here.
My dear Polaco!
What a surprise!
Alberto!
You can stay here as long as you want.
You can't imagine how convenient it is for me that you're here.
- Who's that boy who was here?
- Luis?
He's a good boy, trust him.
- Except flying, he can do anything.
- Does he live here?
No, in a ranch in the village.
He lives alone, he's an orphan.
In this note you can find our upcoming services,
-and the coordinates for each batch.
- OK.
When there's too much work I stay here so I don't have to go back and forth.
Sauce Grande is more than 9O km away.
Fine.
- Do you have animals?
- I used to.
They are now part of the car the superintendent bought.
He's a rustler.
A criminal son of a bitch.
Avoid him.
There are working clothes in that closet for you to wear.
And some supplies in that unit.
It's not much.
Don't worry, Alberto.
I'll manage.
Use the van.
Your car screams outsider.
You should keep a low profile.
Thanks, Alberto.
- I hope I can pay you back some day.
- Don't mention it.
This is your house.
Help yourself.
Come here.
Good.
Good.
Is that your dog?
No, he showed up last night.
He was hurt, he might be a stray.
He's not a stray.
They run away when they are beaten.
- You'll need to name him if he's staying.
- I already did.
- What?
- Zorro.
- Have a good flight.
- Thanks.
What the hell?
Shit!
- Are you OK, man?
- Yes.
You?
Yes, but that was close.
We almost didn't make it.
Sorry, the engine died, I had no option.
I'm the superintendent of Colonia Elena.
I'm Alberto Tejero's pilot.
- I knew that plane.
Do you want a ride?
- No, don't worry.
There aren't so many people around here.
I'd appreciate it if you'd take me to the village.
I'll find help there.
Sure, but let's move it, because someone could come.
Here.
That way.
Now downwards.
I hadn't seen you around.
You're not from here, are you?
No.
- Where are you from?
- Buenos Aires.
Portefio!
Portefios are nice.
It's very beautiful there.
That maneuver you did between the trees...
You're not a rookie.
Am I wrong?
Those things happen.
It's just a routine.
Do you plan on staying long?
As long as they need me.
You're not too chatty for a portefio.
- I really appreciate your help.
- I'm Pedro Velarde.
And you are...?
- Tomés.
Thanks again.
- You're welcome.
Polaco, let's go!
A plane is just a plane.
What's important is that you're safe.
You need to let go.
It's not easy.
I shouldn't have flown.
You're a good guy, Polaco.
Don't doubt yourself.
Looks familiar?
That was my dad's, right?
When your dad left the company he gave his life for, he was offered big money, but he had to approve some dubious balances.
Instead of grabbing a pen, he grabbed a lighter and set them on fire.
I didn't know about the fire.
Many years with me.
Thank you.
That's where you come from.
Don't forget.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
- Do you have cylinders?
- Yes, I'll bring you one.
- Did something happen to Alberto?
- No, I'm just working for him.
- How much?
- Please pay inside.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- I have to pay for a cylinder.
- Yes, it's $330.
I saw you shopping a few days ago.
Have you moved here?
- No, I just came to help a friend.
- Yes, I saw his pickup there.
Here.
- Don't you have any change?
- No, sorry.
You can pay some other time.
- Really?
- Yes.
Well,thank you.
Do you want anything else?
No.
- Thank you.
Bye.
- Bye.
Mr. Tomés!
I found a job.
A field to clean up.
Since the plane isn't flying...
- Do you mind?
- No, don't worry.
I'll manage.
Thank you so much.
It will only be a couple of days.
- Hello.
- Hello.
Whiskey neat, please.
Hello, darling.
- Would you like some fun?
- No,thank you.
If you change your mind, I'm right there.
Another cafia.
Welcome to the temple.
That gentleman's drink is on me.
- Good morning, how are you?
- Good morning.
Going shopping?
Yes, some stuff.
- I still owe you for the cylinder.
- Don't worry, pay whenever you want.
I can pay, I have some change.
$330, right?
Yes.
- Here,thank you.
- Thank you.
I'm off to the hangar.
Do you want a ride?
No,thank you.
OK.
- See you.
- God willing.
If Super sees his wife talking to the grunt, she'll be in trouble.
What did you just say?
Sorry, I...
Repeat what you just said!
I said if he sees her talking to a stranger...
Not a stranger!
You said "grunt".
Don't try to fool me.
Come with me.
Superintendent, please...
What's going on?
Why did you call the guy who was with Nancy a grunt?
- Because he is.
- How the hell do you know?
He asked for a call to Buenos Aires and I saw his badge as he paid for it.
- Shut the fuck up!
- Shut it!
Did you get to see his surname?
- His surname!
- Kóblic.
Why didn't you tell me earlier that he was from the military?
I don't know.
I didn't think about it.
Don't you know me?
Don't you know you have to tell me everything?
- Yes...
- Have you forgotten who's in charge here?
- Don't you ever forget!
- No, superintendent.
- Never!
You hear me?
- I promise, sir.
No, superintendent!
Sorry, I thought no one was there.
Electricity went off and Enzo is out.
- But if you need gas, maybe I can manage.
- No, I still have some.
- Can I help you with that?
- Yes.
- Where do I put it?
- Thank you.
Just right there.
- Yes.
- There.
- Thank you.
- No problem.
This happens every once in a while.
Some wire is burned and electricity goes off.
Is it true that you landed on the road?
- You already know that.
- One knows everything here.
I guess.
Aren't you scared of having such a dangerous job?
It's not so dangerous if you know what you're doing.
- Have you ever flown?
- Me?
No.
- And I wouldn't like to.
- Would you be scared?
I don't know.
- I like other things.
- Sure.
Such as...?
Have I just asked something I shouldn't have?
- I was never asked that question.
- Never?
Never.
- I'm sorry.
- No, I am sorry.
Sorry.
I'd better leave.
Excuse me, sir.
- Luis is here.
- Let him in.
Come in.
Take a seat.
With your permission.
Why do you look so scared?
The sergeant came to my house looking for me, but he wouldn't say why.
Don't worry, you're not under arrest.
- Do you want a smoke?
- No,thank you.
Why am I here, superintendent?
I just wanted to have a little chat with you.
Tell me, Luisito.
That aviator friend of Mr. Alberto's...
What do you know about him?
I know he came to work with Mr. Alberto in the fumigation.
I already know that.
I meant something else.
Haven't you noticed anything strange about that guy?
Strange, like what?
- I don't understand.
- What don't you understand?
Are you dumb?
- Don't you know what is strange?
- Yes, but I haven't noticed anything.
Mr. Tomés is a good man.
He's good to me and to Mr. Alberto.
- I only know him from work.
- What work?
Their plane hasn't worked for weeks.
Yes, but Mr. Tomas is taking the chance to fix a lot of things at the hangar.
Listen carefully to what I'm going to say.
Today more than ever you need to be careful with those you don't know.
Many people say they're one thing, but they're something else.
Do you understand?
Fine.
Listen to me.
If you notice anything, however stupid it may seem, come and tell me immediately.
- Is it clear?
- Yes, superintendent.
And don't ever think of trying to lie to me.
Or trying to hide something from me.
Otherwise, you'll know me for real.
- Understood?
- Yes, superintendent.
Now go.
And don't tell anyone about our private man-to-man talk.
Now go.
Excuse me.
Come in.
Tell me, colonel, are you satisfied with the performance of my men?
If you want to raise my commission, say it.
No, I'm not here to discuss money.
I'm here because there's been some grunt around my patch for a while now.
I wonder who sent him.
In Colonia Elena there are no subsidies, nobody cares about that crappy hamlet.
- How do you know he's from the military?
- The postman saw his documents.
He's here to pilot a crop-spraying plane, but the plane isn't flying.
And yet he's still there.
Maybe some comrade of yours... is trying to steal our business.
That's a possibility.
- What's his name?
- His surname is Kóblic.
His first name is Tomés.
Mind your business.
I'll take care of this.
Come on, leave!
At your service, Colonel.
Can you believe the bank has returned my checks?
Where the fuck did I put the delivery notes?
I must go to La Plata so that the supply from the tank trucks is not cut off.
I won't be back tonight.
Perhaps tomorrow.
- Enzo, I'm not feeling well.
I'm leaving.
- Get well.
Tell me.
How did you end up in this place?
I go where my job takes me.
But this is awful.
I don't have anywhere to go.
Otherwise, I would have left.
Were you born here?
No.
I came to live here around ten years ago.
Where's your family?
Let's not ask questions.
Right.
- Good morning, Enzo.
- Good morning, superintendent.
Fill it!
- Are you stupid?
Give me the good one!
- Excuse me, I didn't realize.
- Where's Nancy?
- She left early.
- Strange to see the old man in the plane.
- Maybe it's the other pilot.
Motherfucker...
You have food in the kitchen.
I already had dinner on the road.
I couldn't sort out things today.
I'll go back to Buenos Aires tomorrow.
I need to travel on a light stomach.
Omar, please, I'm half asleep.
Omar, please leave me alone!
- You can sleep, I'll do my thing.
- I don't want to!
Leave me alone!
- How do I need to say it?
- You're my wife, you'll do as I say!
- I'm not your wife, you know that.
- You are my wife!
What the fuck is wrong with you?
Come here!
Open the door!
Don't make me knock it down!
Open it!
Open the door!
- Come here!
- No!
What the fuck's wrong with you?
- What?
- Leave me alone!
- What's wrong?
- Leave me!
Tell me!
What's wrong with you?
Is he coming back in the afternoon?
Well, if you see colonel Bonilla today or tomorrow or whenever, please tell him to call me.
Thank you.
Fucking grunt!
I thought you were out.
Is something wrong with you?
I think Nancy is cheating on me.
Are you sure of that?
You haven't heard anything?
Nothing at all.
- I'll kill that motherfucker like a dog.
- Wait!
Don't get obsessed.
Maybe you're just imagining it.
If you find out anything, please, let me know.
Of course, you can trust me.
- Good morning, Enzo.
- Mr. Omar, how are you doing?
Fine.
Tell me.
Have you seen anyone here lately like talking to my wife?
No, I don't think so.
Fine, I'm going to Buenos Aires.
See you the day after tomorrow.
- OK, Mr. Omar.
- Forget what I just asked.
- What's up, Cosme?
- Look,
Velarde came to ask about your friend, the pilot.
He wants me to talk to him, to get information out of him.
I didn't ask him why.
I'm not going to ask you either.
- Thank you, Cosme.
- Bye.
- Hello!
- Hello!
- How are you doing, Alberto?
- Fine.
- What happened?
- I'm having trouble starting it.
- I'm cleaning the spark plugs.
You OK?
- Yeah.
Have you had any issue with the superintendent?
I haven't, why?
- Luisito, how are you!
- Fine!
- Can you prepare some mate?
- Yes, Mr. Alberto.
He's asking questions.
He wants to know about you.
The whole village is on the alert.
I have a friend in Mendoza.
He'll help you.
I'm going to my granddaughter's birthday.
I'll call him from my daughter's house.
Alberto, you've done a lot for me.
Don't worry, I'll manage.
No way.
Make up your mind about Mendoza.
I'll be back in three days, and you'll leave.
Alright, thanks.
SPARE PARTS
- These are new, Nancy?
- Yes.
- You have to pay inside.
- Yes, thanks.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
Is it the cylinder?
Yes.
How much is it?
-$330.
- These, Nancy.
How much are they?
Yes, give me a second.
Here.
Your change.
The brushes cost...
".450 pesos.
Take a seat.
Look...
I've been thinking.
And...
I don't have evidence of anything, but since you were so sure that Nancy was seeing someone,
I put two and two together.
There's a guy.
That pilot who came to work with Mr. Alberto.
He's living in the old man's hangar.
Have you seen him around?
No.
Well...
I saw him once... chatting with Nancy.
And she...
She was giggling-
I must confess I had a bad feeling about it.
Because I have my instinct.
But I didn't worry about it until you came to ask me.
I may be wrong.
But there's something else that is not quite right.
That guy came to work on the old man's plane.
But the plane broke down how long ago?
And the guy's not leaving.
He's still there.
Why is he still there?
He'll leave.
The motherfucker will leave in a coffin!
Wait, calm down!
Drink this.
You don't know anything.
I didn't tell you anything.
Only if you're careful.
Alright?
First I'll kill that pilot, and then I'll come for you!
Put it up.
Good morning, is Mr. Alberto there?
No.
- Are you the new pilot?
- Yes, why?
What did she say about me?
What did she say?
First I'll kill you and then her, you son of a bitch!
Just die!
It wasn't you, it was me.
Do you understand?
Listen to me.
This is my responsibility.
You're not involved in this.
Go to the village.
Make yourself seen.
Like you've been working the fields.
Don't show up around here.
SUPERMARKET
Good morning, ma'am.
Good morning.
- Good morning.
- Good morning, sir.
- Any news?
- None, sir.
- Hasn't Super come to see me?
- No, sir.
- He hasn't called?
- No, sir.
He hasn't.
The license plate is B 1525 835.
Yes.
The owner is Omar Olivera Montes.
Monies'.!
As soon as you know anything, call me.
Luis!
- Are you going to Mr. Alberto's place?
- No.
I just came to buy my lunch.
Did you see Super near the hangar yesterday?
I haven't been there for a few days.
I've been working with the Magdanas.
Is something wrong?
No.
- Are you sure?
- Yes.
- Go on, go do your stuff.
- Excuse me.
This way.
Hello, Nancy.
Come in.
- Mr. Zaldivar is the district judge.
- Pleased to meet you.
- What happened?
- Please take a seat.
Mr. Zaldivar will explain.
Your husband's car has been found.
- I'm not married.
- Then your partner's, Mr. Olivera Montes.
At a supermarket parking lot in the town of Loma Rosa.
Tell me, Nancy, is there any reason why Omar went to Loma Rosa?
I don't know.
He's always traveling.
Sometimes he leaves for a few days, but...
What happened?
Nancy, we don't want to startle you.
Probably everything's fine.
But the judge here thinks we need to send an alert to find him.
First of all, we need you to report your partner's disappearance.
Alright.
Where should I do that?
Right here.
Your data, please?
My ID number:
4370 O31.
-33 years old.
- Your name?
Nancy Adriana.
Your surname?
Olivera Montes.
No,yours.
Olivera Montes.
Do you have the same surname as your partner?
He's my uncle.
Where do I need to sign?
- Can I go?
- Yes, of course, Nancy.
Sergeant Romero will take you home.
- Please let me know if you have any news.
- Sure, Nancy.
Excuse me.
I had to go to the police station and sign a report so they can search for Omar.
- Are you a suspect?
- No.
- Did they mention my name?
- No.
But they've found his car.
What are we going to do?
Staying here is too dangerous for me.
I have to go.
Alberto got me a place.
When he gets back, I'm off.
- When will he be back?
- Today, I think.
- Take me with you.
- I can't, Nancy.
- Please take me with you.
- I can't.
We need to buy some time, so that they forget about it.
Trust me.
When the moment's right, I'll come for you.
Mr. Alberto!
Excuse me, I didn't mean to startle you.
Listen.
I know you don't like me.
You may have your reasons.
But I'd like to have a little chat with you.
We don't have anything to talk about.
Yes, we do.
Kóblic.
He's a pilot friend who took my place.
And what is it that you don't want to tell me?
I don't have anything else to tell you.
- I'm all ears.
- Go fuck yourself!
Oh, yeah?
Let's see what you say after this.
- Son of a bitch!
- Say it, for fuck's sake!
- Son of a bitch!
- Who's Kóblic?
What the fuck is he doing here?
Say it!
Alberto!
Alberto!
Alberto!
Alberto!
Why do you think something happened to Alberto?
You ask me why?
When I got to the hangar,
His trunk was open, a box was on the floor, and the key inside.
I looked for him everywhere and I couldn't find him.
It's weird, yeah.
But he's a well-loved man.
Who would want to hurt him?
Unless...
- Luis had an issue with him.
- No, no.
"A fight?
"No!
- He was acting weird.
- Luisito has nothing to do with this.
He hasn't gone to the hangar in quite a while.
I'm a policeman, I need to look for suspects.
It's my job, OK?
But I wonder whether there's something bigger behind all this.
I don't understand.
Nowadays...
Something very similar happened to a friend of mine, the service station owner.
He hasn't been seen for a while now.
Like he's vanished into thin air.
Only his car has been found.
We have two cars.
Their owners are missing.
Don't worry, I'll call the departmental police and we'll clear this up.
I hope so.
As soon as you know anything about Alberto, let me know immediately.
I'll keep looking for him.
You too.
I mean, if you learn anything from my friend,
I'd appreciate it.
- Mr. Tomés.
- What?
- I want to go with you.
- Didn't you come
-on horseback?
- I mean, to Mendoza.
Good morning, captain Kóblic.
Let me introduce myself.
Captain Sanchez Ligure.
We met on the circle many years ago.
I'm retired now.
I'm very glad that you haven't missed the appointment.
Let's find some quiet place.
How did you find me?
A certain Colonel Bonilla.
The army.
Mayor Sousa Grande has been doing some research.
- I don't know him.
- He does know you, at least your name.
Where are your people?
What people?
I came alone.
We're among honorable people.
I thought I wasn't honorable for you.
Don't say that.
Don't blame yourself for a moment of weakness that anyone can have.
Is it really worth losing everything when you're months away from retirement?
And for such a stupid thing?
Hiding like an outlaw.
You're an army official, for God's sake!
You don't deserve any of this.
Look, I came to give you peace of mind.
To offer you the chance that a man like you deserves.
I appreciate it.
Because, honestly, I don't know what...
It's quite easy.
Show up tomorrow early in the morning, fulfill your duty and it will be as if nothing happened.
Don't miss this chance.
I'll be waiting for you tomorrow morning.
Don't let me down.
We're approaching the area.
Proceed!
Open the gate!
Open the gate!
What's wrong, Kóblic?
Open the gate!
What the fuck is wrong with you?
Open the gate!
The lieutenant will be in charge.
Leave the cockpit now!
Fucking coward!
What?
Come on!
So I can throw you with the others.
Sit down!
- Open the gate!
- Yes, sir.
Come on, get in!
If I'm not there when the sun goes down, go to Madariaga.
Leave the car, take the bus, and come back like nothing happened.
Don't take any other route or you might be stopped by the police or the military.
- Understood?
- Yes, sir.
Here, just in case.
You'll give it back next time we meet.
- Have a good trip.
- Thanks.
Captain, this has gone too far.
Let's not make things worse.
Let's talk things...
Kóblic!
Kóblic!
Sir, we're ready.
MILITARY SECTOR, BUENOS AIRES AIRPORT
- JUNE, 1977
Up!
Go on!
Walk!
No!
Up!
Now!
Get inside, now!
Here we are again in another shithole.
- Like all the destinations you've had.
- Please shut up, Emilce.
COLONIA ELENA INN
Good morning!
- Good morning.
- Hello.
Good morning.
- I need to make a call to Buenos Aires.
- Of course, there's the phone.
- Yes, please.
- Go ahead.
- Here.
- Thanks, Anselmo.
Do I owe you anything?
- No, it's paid for.
- OK.
- Could you sign here?
- Sure.
Thank you.
Goodbye.
Good morning, Rogelio.
Sorry to bother you at home.
I guess you already know...
Yes.
Yes, yes.
That's how it happened.
Of course I want to go back.
I'm just about to retire.
I know, but I thought that maybe you...
I understand, sir.
No.
I won't do that.
Definitely, no.
I'm really surprised.
I thought you'd say something else.
Then we have the same problem.
I also have my limits.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
- How much is it?
-100 pesos for three minutes.
Here.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- Do you remember what you have to do?
- I'll ask them about you.
You said goodbye, went to work, and never came back, nor called.
- And I'm very worried.
- Yes.
They'll ask you lots of questions to try and find me.
Mention all my destinations you know.
They don't know about this place or about my friendship with Alberto.
There is no way they will get here, OK?
What?
Do you want to say something?
- It's nothing.
- Come on, say it.
What a sad ending.
Yes.
Yes.
Constatino will call you.
Don't trust him.
No matter what he or his wife says.
I'm worried about you, not just me.
I don't want him to bother you.
Understand?
Take care, Tomés.
Yes,you too.
Hi!
I'm a friend of Alberto's.
I'll wait for him here.
My dear Polaco!
What a surprise!
Alberto!
You can stay here as long as you want.
You can't imagine how convenient it is for me that you're here.
- Who's that boy who was here?
- Luis?
He's a good boy, trust him.
- Except flying, he can do anything.
- Does he live here?
No, in a ranch in the village.
He lives alone, he's an orphan.
In this note you can find our upcoming services,
-and the coordinates for each batch.
- OK.
When there's too much work I stay here so I don't have to go back and forth.
Sauce Grande is more than 9O km away.
Fine.
- Do you have animals?
- I used to.
They are now part of the car the superintendent bought.
He's a rustler.
A criminal son of a bitch.
Avoid him.
There are working clothes in that closet for you to wear.
And some supplies in that unit.
It's not much.
Don't worry, Alberto.
I'll manage.
Use the van.
Your car screams outsider.
You should keep a low profile.
Thanks, Alberto.
- I hope I can pay you back some day.
- Don't mention it.
This is your house.
Help yourself.
Come here.
Good.
Good.
Is that your dog?
No, he showed up last night.
He was hurt, he might be a stray.
He's not a stray.
They run away when they are beaten.
- You'll need to name him if he's staying.
- I already did.
- What?
- Zorro.
- Have a good flight.
- Thanks.
What the hell?
Shit!
- Are you OK, man?
- Yes.
You?
Yes, but that was close.
We almost didn't make it.
Sorry, the engine died, I had no option.
I'm the superintendent of Colonia Elena.
I'm Alberto Tejero's pilot.
- I knew that plane.
Do you want a ride?
- No, don't worry.
There aren't so many people around here.
I'd appreciate it if you'd take me to the village.
I'll find help there.
Sure, but let's move it, because someone could come.
Here.
That way.
Now downwards.
I hadn't seen you around.
You're not from here, are you?
No.
- Where are you from?
- Buenos Aires.
Portefio!
Portefios are nice.
It's very beautiful there.
That maneuver you did between the trees...
You're not a rookie.
Am I wrong?
Those things happen.
It's just a routine.
Do you plan on staying long?
As long as they need me.
You're not too chatty for a portefio.
- I really appreciate your help.
- I'm Pedro Velarde.
And you are...?
- Tomés.
Thanks again.
- You're welcome.
Polaco, let's go!
A plane is just a plane.
What's important is that you're safe.
You need to let go.
It's not easy.
I shouldn't have flown.
You're a good guy, Polaco.
Don't doubt yourself.
Looks familiar?
That was my dad's, right?
When your dad left the company he gave his life for, he was offered big money, but he had to approve some dubious balances.
Instead of grabbing a pen, he grabbed a lighter and set them on fire.
I didn't know about the fire.
Many years with me.
Thank you.
That's where you come from.
Don't forget.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
- Do you have cylinders?
- Yes, I'll bring you one.
- Did something happen to Alberto?
- No, I'm just working for him.
- How much?
- Please pay inside.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- I have to pay for a cylinder.
- Yes, it's $330.
I saw you shopping a few days ago.
Have you moved here?
- No, I just came to help a friend.
- Yes, I saw his pickup there.
Here.
- Don't you have any change?
- No, sorry.
You can pay some other time.
- Really?
- Yes.
Well,thank you.
Do you want anything else?
No.
- Thank you.
Bye.
- Bye.
Mr. Tomés!
I found a job.
A field to clean up.
Since the plane isn't flying...
- Do you mind?
- No, don't worry.
I'll manage.
Thank you so much.
It will only be a couple of days.
- Hello.
- Hello.
Whiskey neat, please.
Hello, darling.
- Would you like some fun?
- No,thank you.
If you change your mind, I'm right there.
Another cafia.
Welcome to the temple.
That gentleman's drink is on me.
- Good morning, how are you?
- Good morning.
Going shopping?
Yes, some stuff.
- I still owe you for the cylinder.
- Don't worry, pay whenever you want.
I can pay, I have some change.
$330, right?
Yes.
- Here,thank you.
- Thank you.
I'm off to the hangar.
Do you want a ride?
No,thank you.
OK.
- See you.
- God willing.
If Super sees his wife talking to the grunt, she'll be in trouble.
What did you just say?
Sorry, I...
Repeat what you just said!
I said if he sees her talking to a stranger...
Not a stranger!
You said "grunt".
Don't try to fool me.
Come with me.
Superintendent, please...
What's going on?
Why did you call the guy who was with Nancy a grunt?
- Because he is.
- How the hell do you know?
He asked for a call to Buenos Aires and I saw his badge as he paid for it.
- Shut the fuck up!
- Shut it!
Did you get to see his surname?
- His surname!
- Kóblic.
Why didn't you tell me earlier that he was from the military?
I don't know.
I didn't think about it.
Don't you know me?
Don't you know you have to tell me everything?
- Yes...
- Have you forgotten who's in charge here?
- Don't you ever forget!
- No, superintendent.
- Never!
You hear me?
- I promise, sir.
No, superintendent!
Sorry, I thought no one was there.
Electricity went off and Enzo is out.
- But if you need gas, maybe I can manage.
- No, I still have some.
- Can I help you with that?
- Yes.
- Where do I put it?
- Thank you.
Just right there.
- Yes.
- There.
- Thank you.
- No problem.
This happens every once in a while.
Some wire is burned and electricity goes off.
Is it true that you landed on the road?
- You already know that.
- One knows everything here.
I guess.
Aren't you scared of having such a dangerous job?
It's not so dangerous if you know what you're doing.
- Have you ever flown?
- Me?
No.
- And I wouldn't like to.
- Would you be scared?
I don't know.
- I like other things.
- Sure.
Such as...?
Have I just asked something I shouldn't have?
- I was never asked that question.
- Never?
Never.
- I'm sorry.
- No, I am sorry.
Sorry.
I'd better leave.
Excuse me, sir.
- Luis is here.
- Let him in.
Come in.
Take a seat.
With your permission.
Why do you look so scared?
The sergeant came to my house looking for me, but he wouldn't say why.
Don't worry, you're not under arrest.
- Do you want a smoke?
- No,thank you.
Why am I here, superintendent?
I just wanted to have a little chat with you.
Tell me, Luisito.
That aviator friend of Mr. Alberto's...
What do you know about him?
I know he came to work with Mr. Alberto in the fumigation.
I already know that.
I meant something else.
Haven't you noticed anything strange about that guy?
Strange, like what?
- I don't understand.
- What don't you understand?
Are you dumb?
- Don't you know what is strange?
- Yes, but I haven't noticed anything.
Mr. Tomés is a good man.
He's good to me and to Mr. Alberto.
- I only know him from work.
- What work?
Their plane hasn't worked for weeks.
Yes, but Mr. Tomas is taking the chance to fix a lot of things at the hangar.
Listen carefully to what I'm going to say.
Today more than ever you need to be careful with those you don't know.
Many people say they're one thing, but they're something else.
Do you understand?
Fine.
Listen to me.
If you notice anything, however stupid it may seem, come and tell me immediately.
- Is it clear?
- Yes, superintendent.
And don't ever think of trying to lie to me.
Or trying to hide something from me.
Otherwise, you'll know me for real.
- Understood?
- Yes, superintendent.
Now go.
And don't tell anyone about our private man-to-man talk.
Now go.
Excuse me.
Come in.
Tell me, colonel, are you satisfied with the performance of my men?
If you want to raise my commission, say it.
No, I'm not here to discuss money.
I'm here because there's been some grunt around my patch for a while now.
I wonder who sent him.
In Colonia Elena there are no subsidies, nobody cares about that crappy hamlet.
- How do you know he's from the military?
- The postman saw his documents.
He's here to pilot a crop-spraying plane, but the plane isn't flying.
And yet he's still there.
Maybe some comrade of yours... is trying to steal our business.
That's a possibility.
- What's his name?
- His surname is Kóblic.
His first name is Tomés.
Mind your business.
I'll take care of this.
Come on, leave!
At your service, Colonel.
Can you believe the bank has returned my checks?
Where the fuck did I put the delivery notes?
I must go to La Plata so that the supply from the tank trucks is not cut off.
I won't be back tonight.
Perhaps tomorrow.
- Enzo, I'm not feeling well.
I'm leaving.
- Get well.
Tell me.
How did you end up in this place?
I go where my job takes me.
But this is awful.
I don't have anywhere to go.
Otherwise, I would have left.
Were you born here?
No.
I came to live here around ten years ago.
Where's your family?
Let's not ask questions.
Right.
- Good morning, Enzo.
- Good morning, superintendent.
Fill it!
- Are you stupid?
Give me the good one!
- Excuse me, I didn't realize.
- Where's Nancy?
- She left early.
- Strange to see the old man in the plane.
- Maybe it's the other pilot.
Motherfucker...
You have food in the kitchen.
I already had dinner on the road.
I couldn't sort out things today.
I'll go back to Buenos Aires tomorrow.
I need to travel on a light stomach.
Omar, please, I'm half asleep.
Omar, please leave me alone!
- You can sleep, I'll do my thing.
- I don't want to!
Leave me alone!
- How do I need to say it?
- You're my wife, you'll do as I say!
- I'm not your wife, you know that.
- You are my wife!
What the fuck is wrong with you?
Come here!
Open the door!
Don't make me knock it down!
Open it!
Open the door!
- Come here!
- No!
What the fuck's wrong with you?
- What?
- Leave me alone!
- What's wrong?
- Leave me!
Tell me!
What's wrong with you?
Is he coming back in the afternoon?
Well, if you see colonel Bonilla today or tomorrow or whenever, please tell him to call me.
Thank you.
Fucking grunt!
I thought you were out.
Is something wrong with you?
I think Nancy is cheating on me.
Are you sure of that?
You haven't heard anything?
Nothing at all.
- I'll kill that motherfucker like a dog.
- Wait!
Don't get obsessed.
Maybe you're just imagining it.
If you find out anything, please, let me know.
Of course, you can trust me.
- Good morning, Enzo.
- Mr. Omar, how are you doing?
Fine.
Tell me.
Have you seen anyone here lately like talking to my wife?
No, I don't think so.
Fine, I'm going to Buenos Aires.
See you the day after tomorrow.
- OK, Mr. Omar.
- Forget what I just asked.
- What's up, Cosme?
- Look,
Velarde came to ask about your friend, the pilot.
He wants me to talk to him, to get information out of him.
I didn't ask him why.
I'm not going to ask you either.
- Thank you, Cosme.
- Bye.
- Hello!
- Hello!
- How are you doing, Alberto?
- Fine.
- What happened?
- I'm having trouble starting it.
- I'm cleaning the spark plugs.
You OK?
- Yeah.
Have you had any issue with the superintendent?
I haven't, why?
- Luisito, how are you!
- Fine!
- Can you prepare some mate?
- Yes, Mr. Alberto.
He's asking questions.
He wants to know about you.
The whole village is on the alert.
I have a friend in Mendoza.
He'll help you.
I'm going to my granddaughter's birthday.
I'll call him from my daughter's house.
Alberto, you've done a lot for me.
Don't worry, I'll manage.
No way.
Make up your mind about Mendoza.
I'll be back in three days, and you'll leave.
Alright, thanks.
SPARE PARTS
- These are new, Nancy?
- Yes.
- You have to pay inside.
- Yes, thanks.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
Is it the cylinder?
Yes.
How much is it?
-$330.
- These, Nancy.
How much are they?
Yes, give me a second.
Here.
Your change.
The brushes cost...
".450 pesos.
Take a seat.
Look...
I've been thinking.
And...
I don't have evidence of anything, but since you were so sure that Nancy was seeing someone,
I put two and two together.
There's a guy.
That pilot who came to work with Mr. Alberto.
He's living in the old man's hangar.
Have you seen him around?
No.
Well...
I saw him once... chatting with Nancy.
And she...
She was giggling-
I must confess I had a bad feeling about it.
Because I have my instinct.
But I didn't worry about it until you came to ask me.
I may be wrong.
But there's something else that is not quite right.
That guy came to work on the old man's plane.
But the plane broke down how long ago?
And the guy's not leaving.
He's still there.
Why is he still there?
He'll leave.
The motherfucker will leave in a coffin!
Wait, calm down!
Drink this.
You don't know anything.
I didn't tell you anything.
Only if you're careful.
Alright?
First I'll kill that pilot, and then I'll come for you!
Put it up.
Good morning, is Mr. Alberto there?
No.
- Are you the new pilot?
- Yes, why?
What did she say about me?
What did she say?
First I'll kill you and then her, you son of a bitch!
Just die!
It wasn't you, it was me.
Do you understand?
Listen to me.
This is my responsibility.
You're not involved in this.
Go to the village.
Make yourself seen.
Like you've been working the fields.
Don't show up around here.
SUPERMARKET
Good morning, ma'am.
Good morning.
- Good morning.
- Good morning, sir.
- Any news?
- None, sir.
- Hasn't Super come to see me?
- No, sir.
- He hasn't called?
- No, sir.
He hasn't.
The license plate is B 1525 835.
Yes.
The owner is Omar Olivera Montes.
Monies'.!
As soon as you know anything, call me.
Luis!
- Are you going to Mr. Alberto's place?
- No.
I just came to buy my lunch.
Did you see Super near the hangar yesterday?
I haven't been there for a few days.
I've been working with the Magdanas.
Is something wrong?
No.
- Are you sure?
- Yes.
- Go on, go do your stuff.
- Excuse me.
This way.
Hello, Nancy.
Come in.
- Mr. Zaldivar is the district judge.
- Pleased to meet you.
- What happened?
- Please take a seat.
Mr. Zaldivar will explain.
Your husband's car has been found.
- I'm not married.
- Then your partner's, Mr. Olivera Montes.
At a supermarket parking lot in the town of Loma Rosa.
Tell me, Nancy, is there any reason why Omar went to Loma Rosa?
I don't know.
He's always traveling.
Sometimes he leaves for a few days, but...
What happened?
Nancy, we don't want to startle you.
Probably everything's fine.
But the judge here thinks we need to send an alert to find him.
First of all, we need you to report your partner's disappearance.
Alright.
Where should I do that?
Right here.
Your data, please?
My ID number:
4370 O31.
-33 years old.
- Your name?
Nancy Adriana.
Your surname?
Olivera Montes.
No,yours.
Olivera Montes.
Do you have the same surname as your partner?
He's my uncle.
Where do I need to sign?
- Can I go?
- Yes, of course, Nancy.
Sergeant Romero will take you home.
- Please let me know if you have any news.
- Sure, Nancy.
Excuse me.
I had to go to the police station and sign a report so they can search for Omar.
- Are you a suspect?
- No.
- Did they mention my name?
- No.
But they've found his car.
What are we going to do?
Staying here is too dangerous for me.
I have to go.
Alberto got me a place.
When he gets back, I'm off.
- When will he be back?
- Today, I think.
- Take me with you.
- I can't, Nancy.
- Please take me with you.
- I can't.
We need to buy some time, so that they forget about it.
Trust me.
When the moment's right, I'll come for you.
Mr. Alberto!
Excuse me, I didn't mean to startle you.
Listen.
I know you don't like me.
You may have your reasons.
But I'd like to have a little chat with you.
We don't have anything to talk about.
Yes, we do.
Kóblic.
He's a pilot friend who took my place.
And what is it that you don't want to tell me?
I don't have anything else to tell you.
- I'm all ears.
- Go fuck yourself!
Oh, yeah?
Let's see what you say after this.
- Son of a bitch!
- Say it, for fuck's sake!
- Son of a bitch!
- Who's Kóblic?
What the fuck is he doing here?
Say it!
Alberto!
Alberto!
Alberto!
Alberto!
Why do you think something happened to Alberto?
You ask me why?
When I got to the hangar,
His trunk was open, a box was on the floor, and the key inside.
I looked for him everywhere and I couldn't find him.
It's weird, yeah.
But he's a well-loved man.
Who would want to hurt him?
Unless...
- Luis had an issue with him.
- No, no.
"A fight?
"No!
- He was acting weird.
- Luisito has nothing to do with this.
He hasn't gone to the hangar in quite a while.
I'm a policeman, I need to look for suspects.
It's my job, OK?
But I wonder whether there's something bigger behind all this.
I don't understand.
Nowadays...
Something very similar happened to a friend of mine, the service station owner.
He hasn't been seen for a while now.
Like he's vanished into thin air.
Only his car has been found.
We have two cars.
Their owners are missing.
Don't worry, I'll call the departmental police and we'll clear this up.
I hope so.
As soon as you know anything about Alberto, let me know immediately.
I'll keep looking for him.
You too.
I mean, if you learn anything from my friend,
I'd appreciate it.
- Mr. Tomés.
- What?
- I want to go with you.
- Didn't you come
-on horseback?
- I mean, to Mendoza.
Good morning, captain Kóblic.
Let me introduce myself.
Captain Sanchez Ligure.
We met on the circle many years ago.
I'm retired now.
I'm very glad that you haven't missed the appointment.
Let's find some quiet place.
How did you find me?
A certain Colonel Bonilla.
The army.
Mayor Sousa Grande has been doing some research.
- I don't know him.
- He does know you, at least your name.
Where are your people?
What people?
I came alone.
We're among honorable people.
I thought I wasn't honorable for you.
Don't say that.
Don't blame yourself for a moment of weakness that anyone can have.
Is it really worth losing everything when you're months away from retirement?
And for such a stupid thing?
Hiding like an outlaw.
You're an army official, for God's sake!
You don't deserve any of this.
Look, I came to give you peace of mind.
To offer you the chance that a man like you deserves.
I appreciate it.
Because, honestly, I don't know what...
It's quite easy.
Show up tomorrow early in the morning, fulfill your duty and it will be as if nothing happened.
Don't miss this chance.
I'll be waiting for you tomorrow morning.
Don't let me down.
We're approaching the area.
Proceed!
Open the gate!
Open the gate!
What's wrong, Kóblic?
Open the gate!
What the fuck is wrong with you?
Open the gate!
The lieutenant will be in charge.
Leave the cockpit now!
Fucking coward!
What?
Come on!
So I can throw you with the others.
Sit down!
- Open the gate!
- Yes, sir.
Come on, get in!
If I'm not there when the sun goes down, go to Madariaga.
Leave the car, take the bus, and come back like nothing happened.
Don't take any other route or you might be stopped by the police or the military.
- Understood?
- Yes, sir.
Here, just in case.
You'll give it back next time we meet.
- Have a good trip.
- Thanks.
Captain, this has gone too far.
Let's not make things worse.
Let's talk things...
Kóblic!
Kóblic!
My name is Oliver Queen.
After 5 years in Hell,
I returned home with only one goal...
To save my city.
Today, I fight that war on two fronts.
By day, I lead Star City as its mayor, but by night, I am someone else.
I am something else.
I am the Green Arrow.
Previously on "Arrow"...
Former police Captain Quentin Lance, who will be serving beside me as Deputy Mayor.
Appreciate the vote of confidence, Mr. Mayor.
Are you not from Star City?
No.
Havenrock.
Felicity, voice-over:
There's something that I need you to know.
Havenrock was not the intended target.
Someone redirected the missile to reduce the number of casualties.
That someone was me.
Ever since I killed Andy...
You think you need to be punished.
Stop fighting for me, Lyla.
We need to talk about John.
He's back in the country, and he's in prison, and I need you to break him out.
Come on, Mr. Olympia.
Hustle up.
Mr. Olympia's a bodybuilding competition.
I was... am an Olympic athlete.
Yeah?
They give out gold medals for effort now?
Very funny, and it was a bronze medal.
Why is that so hard to remember?
Quiet.
Every time you're out in the field, you could die.
Don't forget that, don't lose focus.
Overwatch, do we have the target?
Headed toward the east exit, closing fast.
Do we know what he stole?
Not yet, but I have a feeling we're about to find out.
Only if we snag him in the cordon.
Artemis, be ready.
Does this mean I actually get to shoot someone?
I mean, not, you know, shoot someone shoot someone.
I just meant that more than...
We know what you meant.
You wait for him to reach the cordon, then engage.
Do you copy?
Copy.
- Copy.
- Copy.
Still a lot of ground to cover.
Rag's should be here.
Overwatch, do you have a 20 on Ragman?
I texted him, like, 10 times and then 10 more, but Nada.
Maybe he's sick.
I mean, the flu's been going around, and by the looks of those rags, he does not hit the drycleaner very often.
Hola, muchacho.
Wild Dog, that is Artemis' shot.
I got him.
What the?
I got him.
What did I say?
That was Artemis' shot!
Dude was getting away.
No, he wasn't.
And you missed.
You were in the Navy.
You should know better.
I was dishonorably discharged actually.
You think that I don't know that?
Deliver that and the evidence to the anti-crime unit and then go home.
What about tonight's training session?
You're taking a few days off.
Nice going... again.
How are we supposed to get this buy to the ACU, call a Uber?
* ARROW * Season 05 Episode 04 "Penance" Precisely Synchronized by srjanapala
Oliver.
The Op's over, and you've been MIA for days.
It's not acceptable.
Get it together immediately, or you're off the team.
That's why I'm here, to tell you in person.
I'm off the team.
Feels pretty quick to throw in the towel.
I thought you were just getting started.
I was, and then Felicity told me the truth about her role in Havenrock.
You didn't know she told me.
Did she also tell you that she was faced with an impossible choice?
I completely realize that.
I get it wasn't her fault, but that doesn't change the fact that every time I look at her
I see the faces of my family, of everyone I ever loved.
Felicity is a constant reminder of what I lost, and as long as that's true,
I'm sorry.
I can't be here.
What about your father?
I thought he was the reason you were doing this.
I'll have to find another way to honor him.
I'm sorry to lose you.
I'm sorry to go.
Thank you for everything.
Did my comms deceive me, or did you actually let the recruits take an SCPD victory lap?
It's never a victory lap.
They're... rough around the edges, but they're making progress... except Rory, who was waiting for me upstairs to say that he quit.
He said you spoke with him about Havenrock.
Hey.
How you holding up?
She doesn't know?
About John being in prison?
Oliver told me.
I'm so sorry.
What Lyla means...
We are gonna break him out.
Of military prison?
- Yep.
- Wait, and then what?
John is just a fugitive for the rest of his life?
Better than being punished for something he didn't do.
Lyla, I've been studying the schematics that you hooked me up with.
This would be a lot easier if we had John's cooperation.
U don't have what now?
Apparently, prison is more appealing to John than coming home to his own wife and child.
Ok.
So wait a minute.
Not only do you want to commit multiple felonies and make John a wanted man for the rest of his life, he doesn't actually want you to?
Can I speak with you for a minute?
Yeah.
Is she going to be a problem?
No, but...
I was counting on her being a help.
Maybe I should pull a few of my agents in on this.
No.
If this... if this has your fingerprints on it, then both of John Jr.'s parents will be fugitives.
There is something that might actually make this not impossible.
I just read a briefing memo on a new piece of tech, an antimolecular compound.
I was kind of hoping Felicity could help us get our hands on it.
Lyla, whatever it is, I'll handle it.
Second test over.
Do not make any worse by pulling out suture.
Anatoly, if this is how the Bratva treat their new members,
I'd hate to see how they treat their enemies.
Pass third and final test, find out.
What's the test?
You keep asking about Kovar.
Our sources say this man will get you one step closer.
You have to act fast, though.
He will be arraigned in morning.
Arraigned?
- Jail.
- Yeah, but... what makes you think he'll talk to me.
You trust me.
I trust you.
Look.
It's a little early for a drink, don't you think?
It's not for drinking.
Anatoly, what the hell was that for?
I should probably just start prerecording apologies for being late.
Don't worry.
Thea told us.
I'm sorry, man.
Gout is a bitch.
Yes, it is.
I'm actually gonna be taking some time off to have it taken care of.
Well, fortunately, we now have a deputy mayor to help pick up the slack.
It'll be great working with you.
You've had an impressive career, Mr. Lance?
Yeah.
I mean, a lot of people out there probably wouldn't, uh, share that opinion, but thank you.
Public service isn't easy.
Sometimes, you get a little dirty clearing out the filth.
Speaking of which, I heard there was an arrest last night that may help in our case against Tobias Church.
Sergio Espinosa, long-time Los Halcones member turned Church strongman.
The Green Arrow and his merry band of vigilantes left him gift-wrapped for us at anti-crime.
The only thing that was missing was a bow.
Well, you don't sound to happy about that.
Vigilantes are a superficial solution.
If we need their help to get our streets clean...
It means we haven't done our jobs right.
Do you think that you can get Espinosa to flip on Church?
I'll lean on him hard, see if he buckles.
Make sure he doesn't get any help from crooked cops.
Not a chance.
I'm gonna walk every piece of evidence in the custody chain through myself.
Good.
Uh, if it's all right with you,
I'll have Quentin accompany you, be my... eyes and ears while I'm out of town.
Sure.
Give us a little bit of time to get acquainted.
Heh.
Great.
I'm sorry.
When did, uh, babysitting evidence become part of the job description?
Since I trust you.
You do?
I mean, all things considered?
If we didn't think you were right for the job, we wouldn't have offered it to you, right?
I haven't had a drink in a week, ok?
Where the hell are you going anyway?
Strange time for a vacation.
You should probably assume that it's not a vacation.
Should I even ask?
No.
I...
I'm not gonna be gone long.
Just please make sure that no one destroys the city while I'm away.
Sure.
Ok.
What are you doing?
Reviewing the SCPD evidence log on what we kept from getting stolen from Kord Industries last night.
- 6,800 processor.
- So?
Exactly.
Kord manufactures bleeding-edge tech, military-grade weapons,
I mean, all kinds of city-threatening items.
Why would Church send a guy to steal a computer chip that you could buy from any Tech Village store?
Well, who cares?
Everything's on its way to lockup now.
Because knowing what Church's endgame was is like... it's like this thing that's still out there, lurking.
You all right over there?
Because I've been doing a lot of talking, and you haven't, which is very weird.
Ha!
You know how you told me to tell Rory about Havenrock?
Yeah.
Oh!
He's not sick with the flu, is he?
No.
He's just sick of working with me.
Did you try talking to him?
There's not a lot I can say that would make him feel ok about his entire family being killed.
Incoming.
Another robbery in progress at...
Palmer Tech!
I got to call Oliver.
Or maybe don't, and we'll just let the get robbed.
It will serve Mr. Dennis right for firing us.
He fired me.
You quit.
Because he fired you.
Same thing.
Sanchez, you got anything?
Nada.
What's up?
Hey.
There's been a break-in at Palmer Tech.
Are you still in the area?
Uh...
Yeah.
I can look into that.
How was Palmer Tech?
Before you answer, you should consider that your phone has GPS, and if you were thinking about lying,
I do admire your consistency.
I wasn't thinking of lying to you.
I wasn't looping you in after you made it clear you didn't approve of the decision.
John is the one who doesn't approve of the plan.
John's not thinking clearly.
Well, I bet Roy is, and if he were here,
I think he would tell you that life on the run is no life at all, and I seem to remember you not being on board with that plan.
Roy was making a bad choice just like John is making a bad choice.
He is currently locked up in a military prison for a crime he didn't commit.
To atone for a crime that he did commit, and what does it matter?
John doesn't want to leave.
It is not your choice.
Why do you always have to go and make decisions for him?
He already abandoned the team.
I am not gonna let him abandon his family.
Is that what this is about,
John leaving the team?
This is simple.
I am gonna stop John from making a decision he will come to regret.
You should consider doing the exact same thing with Rory.
You do realize that me having a chat with Rory is completely different than you committing half a dozen felonies, right?
Did you ever think you'd be doing this again, handling evidence?
No.
Didn't think I'd be deputy mayor either, but here we are.
I was surprised you took the job, to be honest.
From what I hear, you and Queen have a, uh...
A complicated history.
Got to be a lot of hatchets to bury there.
Yeah.
Well, at least I know where they're buried.
That's something you can't buy or steal.
Package is here, boss.
D.A., Deputy Mayor, too.
Ah.
Bonus.
Get ready to move.
Let me guess.
Felicity filled you in.
That you're gonna break into a military prison?
Yeah, and you got the nerve to call me Wild Dog?
I'm done debating this.
Really?
Because this is the first we've heard of it.
I thought we were your team.
Running off to bust someone out of prison sounds like team business, and what happens to us when you get caught?
You've made it clear that we can't do this vigilante thing without you.
When I get caught?
I'm not gonna get caught.
Right because we're not gonna let you do this.
I'm sorry.
Did you say that you're not gonna let me?
Yes.
I need to see you physically deposit the item.
I've been on this job 15 years.
I've never lost a piece of evidence.
Now relax, Sergeant.
No one's doubting your proficiency here, ok?
Seems like.
This is it.
You gonna let me do my job now?
Have at it.
- What the hell?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Get out of here!
Whoo!
Find the weapons, boys.
Ahh.
Sorry, gents.
Load them up!
And burn this puppy down.
Let's go, let's go!
Ok.
Last chance.
Get off the street.
I didn't think he'd actually hit you guys.
You know what really sucks?
Realizing that in all those training sessions where he was kicking our respective asses the whole time he was taking it easy on us.
Yeah.
Remind me to never, ever get on his bad side.
I think that would imply that he has a good side, and, you know, Felicity, could you please explain to me again how you thought this was all gonna go down?
Well, I thought if he saw you guys all united against his crazy plan he'd reconsider.
Right because Oliver Queen is known for thinking things through and taking input from others.
Right.
Wow.
The ever-expanding club house.
And who are you?
I'm Thea, Oliver's Chief of Staff.
And also his sister.
Don't tell me Oliver beat you up, too?
Heh.
Ollie did this?
Object lesson, long story.
It's fine.
Don't ask.
What happened to you?
Tobias Church happened.
That evidence that you guys recovered from Kord Industries...
Modified to go boom.
He wanted it to be put into lockup.
And he wanted to raid it.
One-stop shopping for weapons.
Including those RPGs that he took from Amertek if this report's right.
We got to find out what he's planning to do with those weapons...
Because it ain't nothing good.
This is a really bad time for Oliver to be out of town.
Yeah.
I just tried him.
He's gone dark.
Why don't you guys hit the streets?
We want to figure out what Church is up to before it's too late.
- You sure?
- Mm-hmm.
I don't think Oliver would want us out there without him.
Right.
Well, Oliver forfeited his opinion when he left.
Ok, but this is an all hands on deck situation, rag-covered hands included.
Just saying.
Where's Private Jesseman?
This is usually his delivery.
Flu's been tearing through the base, sir.
I drew the short straw.
I don't see you on the list.
Your C.O. should have submitted a change of personnel form.
You sure he didn't?
It's an hour's drive back to the base.
Can't you refresh your Wi-Fi or something?
There you are.
As you were, Private.
Thank you, sir.
I'm in.
25 minutes till extraction.
Roger that.
Facilities cameras are on a closed network.
If you can give me access to the mainframe, I can open it up.
- I'm on my way.
- Oliver...
If you don't make it to the extraction point...
I'll make it, and I won't be alone.
Ahem.
Ohh.
Ahh.
Hey.
You speak English?
Yes.
Your accent...
You are American.
Yeah, maybe once upon a time, but, uh, now I'm more just enjoying everything that Russia has to offer.
Yes.
I can smell that.
You judge me?
You're in this cell, too.
Yes.
A mistake my boss will correct very soon.
You mean Konstantin Kovar?
How do you know that name?
Oh, same way that I know your name's Pyotr Friedkin, same way I know that you launder money for Kovar, same way that I know that's what you're doing here.
How can you know that unless...
Are you Bratva?
He's fine.
Mmm.
I am Bratva, and you are gonna tell me everything that I want to know.
Your turn to run system check.
I'm gonna hit the head.
Don't touch my ball.
Dude, what the hell?
Transponder's in place.
Roger that.
I've got eyes now.
I'll walk you to Johnny's cell.
Hey!
Hey.
Is this... uh, is this a bad time?
Do I want to even ask how you found me?
Heh.
I feel like that's a trick question.
Sorry about the mess.
Wow!
These are amazing.
You spend enough time with other people's castoffs, you find ways to make something useful out of them.
My father always used to say that.
He owned a pawn shop.
On Southmoor Road, right?
How'd you know?
Last week, you told Oliver that you had joined the team to honor your father.
When you quit...
I wanted to find out more about what you were giving up.
Your father was a Gulf War veteran, 2nd Battalion, 1st Marines, but that's not what made him a hero, was it?
No.
He wore your rags, like his father before him, whose name was also Rory.
That's a big legacy to live up to.
Mine is going to be what happened to Havenrock.
I'm gonna have to live with that every day for the rest of my life, knowing that I cannot fix it and knowing that it's not the last mistake that I'm ever going to have to make.
I still don't know if I can...
Work side by side with someone who's a reminder of what you lost.
I understand.
Just like you're a reminder of what I did, and I...
I know they're not the same thing.
We both want the same thing, to be able to live with what's happened so that we can move... forward.
It's Curtis.
I am so sorry, and we could really use you.
I...
I wish I could, Felicity.
I just...
I can't right now.
I'm sorry.
If you change your mind, well, we're here.
Cell 1138, right side, third from the left.
He's not here.
Give me a minute while I scan the feeds.
Oh, no.
What?
They moved him into gen pop.
You go in there, neither of you are getting out.
Talk to me.
When's he coming back to his cell?
Outside our window.
If those MPs wake up, the first thing they're gonna do is move John and all the other prisoners to a more secure location, and we lose our shot.
Abort.
We're blown.
Tell me where I can find Kovar.
You think you scare me more than him?
No, but he's not locked up in here with you.
I am.
You wouldn't kill me in front of all of them.
I'm not gonna lay a finger on you.
Same can't be said for Alisa.
Or maybe I'll visit your wife Maya when she's picking up Alisa from ballet.
Somebody... is gonna die.
It can be Kovar, it can be your wife, it can be your child, but I need you to choose and do it quickly.
Kovar is very paranoid, careful.
We never meet in person, only remotely.
Remotely?
How?
A digital dead drop, the Dark Web.
What's the IP address?
What is the IP address?
108.166.7.161.
If this information is incorrect, your family will suffer.
How does an American become this...
This...
Bratva devil?
I don't know.
About time, Blondie.
Can we go now?
First of all, not my name.
Second, were you able to locate Church on your recon?
No, but street cams actually picked him up, so we know he's on the move.
We just don't know where he's moving to.
We can't go after Church without knowing his endgame first.
Sounds like an excuse to sit around and do nothing.
What are you doing?
Not nothing.
You're cross-plotting.
Church's prior locations into a projection algorithm.
Hmm.
You probably got beat up in grade school a lot.
And junior high.
Ok.
Based on Church's route, I'm calculating an 86% likelihood he's going to 18 Mill Road.
Why does that sound so familiar?
Because we were just there to hand over Sergio.
That's where the ACU's bunkered.
Church is gonna take them out.
Montes, quit screwing around.
Station chief, this is Gans from cell block "C."
We have a code yellow situation.
Initiate immediate lockdown and have all prisoners return to their cells.
I'm not rolling on Church.
You think you scare me more than him?
Hmm.
No...
But he's not here with you.
I am.
Hmm.
You're not gonna put a beating on me.
You're a D.A.
Yeah.
Haven't you heard?
All of the justice in this city comes from vigilantes.
Word on the street is is that Church's planning something, something big.
You tell me what it is, and he'll be the one in those cuffs instead of you.
Heh heh heh.
You're talking about the trust.
Oh, you can't stop it, man.
Can't even... come close.
What's going on?
Church.
At least we definitely know where Church is now.
D'Angelo's right.
We got to put him down.
Against that?
Without Oliver?
No.
We're sh...
Shorthanded as it is.
You scared?
No, but I'm not stupid either.
Evie's right.
I'm not sending you guys out there just to get slaughtered.
Thanks for the vote of confidence.
You saw what you're up against, ok?
This isn't some drill where you take down a petty thug or drug dealer.
This is real, ok, with real stakes.
The 3 of you could die out there.
That's something we get to decide for ourselves, isn't it?
I mean, I don't know about everyone else, but I didn't join this team to stay safe.
Ok.
Why don't we take a vote?
All those in favor.
We're all gonna say yes, Blondie.
God.
That's not my name.
Good.
Ok.
Go.
Do not die.
Code yellow.
Return all prisoners to their cells.
Code yellow.
Return all prisoners to their cells.
Immediate code yellow enforced.
Move prisoners to their cells.
Hey, John.
What's new?
I'm not doing this.
I told Lyla.
Yeah.
You can yell at us later, but right now, we're on a bit of a clock.
Are you even hearing me right now?
I don't want anything to do with this.
The MPs are gonna do a count in a few minutes.
My guess is they're only expecting to find one person in here.
Really?
So that's your play, blackmail?
Do what you say, or you get caught in here, too?
You're my brother, John.
What happens to you happens to me.
Oliver...
I killed my brother.
I went to the army to change, and I haven't changed.
I know, all right, and I know that you think this is your penance for that.
Oliver, it's not just that.
I trusted Andy.
Even when you told me not to, I trusted him, and now Laurel's dead.
I need you, the team needs you, the city needs you.
I'm not saying you shouldn't do your penance.
You probably should, but do it as Spartan.
What's in the box?
It's an antimolecular compound, and theoretically, it should eat through anything.
Not gonna ask you how you got your hands on this.
Hey.
You came back for me, even against my wishes.
I guess I haven't changed that much either.
Maybe that's what I have to do my penance for.
That toy of yours is definitely coming in handy.
Project that Lyla's been keeping an eye on for Argus.
Should have known she'd be helping out.
Tell Johnny he can thank me later.
You've got to keep moving.
Follow the sublevel north 200 meters, then climb up.
What... what is it?
Comm's being jammed.
No, no, no.
Hey.
Is there another way out of here?
Mind uncuffing me before they kill you?
Hi.
Hey.
Hey.
If that's for taking out the wall, the blast will kill us before we can get out.
We're in too tight.
- Trust me.
- Yeah, says the creepy-looking...
What the hell are you anyways?
I'm in place.
Blow it.
Sorry we blew up your building.
Come on!
We're going up.
Then what?
Which way, Overwatch?
Take a right at the end of that hallway.
It should be a fire exit.
If you go through there, you're home free easy.
Not so easy.
Rags, cover me.
Go!
Go, go!
Unh!
Okay.
Get him up.
Come on.
I probably should just shoot you, but...
But you've earned a little suffering.
Get him to safety.
- But...
- Go!
It's ok.
Hey.
Don't kill him.
He may have his uses.
We've got to go back for Wild Dog.
Copy.
Overwatch, Mr. Terrific is hurt.
We could use some help.
Inbound.
Hold on.
Get in!
Where's the Wild Dog kid?
Still inside, fighting Church.
We've got to go back for him.
No.
Unless you all want to die, we've got to go now, now!
We can't just leave him.
You have to.
Go.
Come on!
Let's go.
- Here.
- What's this?
Just put it on.
Let's go.
Dig, your harness.
You two, freeze!
Down on the ground!
Lace your fingers behind your head!
Do it now, or we will shoot!
John, don't move.
This place should keep you off the grid for the time being.
Until we find a permanent solution.
Hey.
First things first.
Can't believe you broke me out of prison.
For better or worse, Johnny.
Told you I wanted to stay.
And I figured if you wanted to make your own decisions then you wouldn't haven't gotten married.
Ok.
How mad was Felicity that you went along with this?
How do you know she thought it was a bad idea?
I know Felicity.
What's wrong?
I have to go.
Hey.
When you said you haven't changed...
Don't.
Dobroye utro.
How was first night in Russian prison?
Friedkin gave up the dead drop, and now he's dead.
Mission accomplished.
Your being sarcasm, yes?
That man wasn't a threat, Anatoly.
He didn't deserve to die.
In Bratva, there is no death without purpose.
If Friedkin living, he is warning Kovar.
If he is warning Kovar, his information not so good.
Vy ponimayete?
Maybe you could have explained that to me before you sent me in there.
I almost didn't kill him.
But you did.
Why?
Because you told me to.
You trust us.
Now we trust you.
Third test over.
You get it?
You are Bratva now, family.
Last handful of honest cops in this city, and Church nearly took them out along with me.
We're just glad you're all right.
I've got to be thinking this is a PR nightmare, something like this going down and the mayor's MIA.
Look.
He called in this morning.
His health problems are almost over.
That's good news.
Um, we're... we're hearing that one of the, uh, vigilantes who was part of the rescue, that he didn't make it out.
Um, any word on him?
CSU hasn't found a body, so...
So Church has him.
I spent most of my life thinking that men in masks were only capable of doing horrible things.
I may have to reevaluate that.
Let me know when Queen gets in.
Will do.
Are you all right?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I mean, I barely knew the kid, Thea.
But that doesn't make it sting any less.
Well, yeah, sure it does.
The year I've had, this is... this is easy.
Yeah.
I mean, cold as that sounds.
Look.
I know why you're asking, ok, and I'm...
I'm fine.
Ok.
I mean, I'm...
I'm...
I'm just saying if things ever get less easy, you know I'm here for you, right?
Noted...
And appreciated.
Ok.
What is the point of having keyhole satellite imagery if you can't use it to find anybody?
I feel like I don't understand half the sentences you say.
What I'm saying is is that no matter how hard I try
I cannot find Rene anywhere.
And I was the one who told you guys to leave him behind.
Sounds like another impossible decision.
Does that mean I'm supposed to get better at making them?
I'm saying you were right.
If we're gonna do this, we can't let guilt swallow us up.
I'll keep you from doing it if you promise the same for me.
Deal.
Ow!
Ow!
Ow!
So "ow" then?
Things have really fallen apart without Oliver, haven't they?
It's a good thing I'm back then.
Was he waiting for an entrance line?
Nope.
He's just that cool.
I got your text.
Have we found Rene?
You get John?
Yeah.
He's fine.
He's holed up at HIVE.
I couldn't write him off, and we... are not gonna write off Rene.
We're gonna find him, we're gonna bring him back...
Wherever he is.
Ah.
Wakey, wakey.
Yow!
Yow!
Heh heh heh.
Hey.
Man, it's been a long time since I've been tagged like this.
Respect.
Oh, my pleasure, but I promise you if you untie me
I'll show you a hell of a lot more than respect.
Ooh, man, you got spirit, and I am duly impressed, but I'm gonna break that spirit.
I'm gonna break your soul, and when we're finished, assuming that you're still alive...
Now I wouldn't bet no money on that, though...
There's gonna be very little of you left for the Green Arrow to work with.
Light him up.
Precisely Synchronized by srjanapala
Greg!
Move your head.
Come on, Mr. Olympia.
Hustle up.
Mr. Olympia's a bodybuilding competition.
I was... am an Olympic athlete.
Yeah?
They give out gold medals for effort now?
Very funny, and it was a bronze medal.
Why is that so hard to remember?
Quiet.
Every time you're out in the field, you could die.
Don't forget that, don't lose focus.
Overwatch, do we have the target?
Headed toward the east exit, closing fast.
Do we know what he stole?
Not yet, but I have a feeling we're about to find out.
Only if we snag him in the cordon.
Artemis, be ready.
Does this mean I actually get to shoot someone?
I mean, not, you know, shoot someone shoot someone.
I just meant that more than...
We know what you meant.
You wait for him to reach the Cordon, then engage.
Do you copy?
Copy.
- Copy.
- Copy.
Still a lot of ground to cover.
Rag's should be here.
Overwatch, do you have a 20 on Ragman?
I texted him, like, 10 times and then 10 more, but Nada.
Maybe he's sick.
I mean, the flu's been going around, and by the looks of those rags, he does not hit the drycleaner very often.
Wild Dog, that is Artemis' shot.
I got him.
What the?
I got him.
What did I say?
That was Artemis' shot!
Dude was getting away.
No, he wasn't.
And you missed.
You were in the Navy.
You should know better.
I was dishonorably discharged actually.
You think that I don't know that?
Deliver that and the evidence to the anti-crime unit and then go home.
What about tonight's training session?
You're taking a few days off.
Nice going... again.
How are we supposed to get this buy to the ACU, call a Uber?
Oliver.
The Op's over, and you've been MIA for days.
It's not acceptable.
Get it together immediately, or you're off the team.
That's why I'm here, to tell you in person.
I'm off the team.
Feels pretty quick to throw in the towel.
I thought you were just getting started.
I was, and then Felicity told me the truth about her role in Havenrock.
You didn't know she told me.
Did she also tell you that she was faced with an impossible choice?
I completely realize that.
I get it wasn't her fault, but that doesn't change the fact that every time I look at her
I see the faces of my family, of everyone I ever loved.
Felicity is a constant reminder of what I lost, and as long as that's true,
I'm sorry.
I can't be here.
What about your father?
I thought he was the reason you were doing this.
I'll have to find another way to honor him.
I'm sorry to lose you.
I'm sorry to go.
Thank you for everything.
Did my comms deceive me, or did you actually let the recruits take an SCPD victory lap?
It's never a victory lap.
They're... rough around the edges, but they're making progress... except Rory, who was waiting for me upstairs to say that he quit.
He said you spoke with him about Havenrock.
Hey.
How you holding up?
She doesn't know?
About John being in prison?
Oliver told me.
I'm so sorry.
What Lyla means...
We are gonna break him out.
Of military prison?
- Yep.
- Wait, and then what?
John is just a fugitive for the rest of his life?
Better than being punished for something he didn't do.
Lyla, I've been studying the schematics that you hooked me up with.
This would be a lot easier if we had John's cooperation.
U don't have what now?
Apparently, prison is more appealing to John than coming home to his own wife and child.
Ok.
So wait a minute.
Not only do you want to commit multiple felonies and make John a wanted man for the rest of his life, he doesn't actually want you to?
Can I speak with you for a minute?
Yeah.
Is she going to be a problem?
No, but...
I was counting on her being a help.
Maybe I should pull a few of my agents in on this.
No.
If this... if this has your fingerprints on it, then both of John Jr.'s parents will be fugitives.
There is something that might actually make this not impossible.
I just read a briefing memo on a new piece of tech, an antimolecular compound.
I was kind of hoping Felicity could help us get our hands on it.
Lyla, whatever it is, I'll handle it.
Second test over.
Do not make any worse by pulling out suture.
Anatoly, if this is how the Bratva treat their new members,
I'd hate to see how they treat their enemies.
Pass third and final test, find out.
What's the test?
You keep asking about Kovar.
Our sources say this man will get you one step closer.
You have to act fast, though.
He will be arraigned in morning.
Arraigned?
- Jail.
- Yeah, but... what makes you think he'll talk to me.
You trust me.
I trust you.
Look.
It's a little early for a drink, don't you think?
It's not for drinking.
Anatoly, what the hell was that for?
I should probably just start prerecording apologies for being late.
Don't worry.
Thea told us.
I'm sorry, man.
Gout is a bitch.
Yes, it is.
I'm actually gonna be taking some time off to have it taken care of.
Well, fortunately, we now have a deputy mayor to help pick up the slack.
It'll be great working with you.
You've had an impressive career, Mr. Lance?
Yeah.
I mean, a lot of people out there probably wouldn't, uh, share that opinion, but thank you.
Public service isn't easy.
Sometimes, you get a little dirty clearing out the filth.
Speaking of which, I heard there was an arrest last night that may help in our case against Tobias Church.
Sergio Espinosa, long-time Los Halcones member turned Church strongman.
The Green Arrow and his merry band of vigilantes left him gift-wrapped for us at anti-crime.
The only thing that was missing was a bow.
Well, you don't sound to happy about that.
Vigilantes are a superficial solution.
If we need their help to get our streets clean...
It means we haven't done our jobs right.
Do you think that you can get Espinosa to flip on Church?
I'll lean on him hard, see if he buckles.
Make sure he doesn't get any help from crooked cops.
Not a chance.
I'm gonna walk every piece of evidence in the custody chain through myself.
Good.
Uh, if it's all right with you,
I'll have Quentin accompany you, be my... eyes and ears while I'm out of town.
Sure.
Give us a little bit of time to get acquainted.
Great.
I'm sorry.
When did, uh, babysitting evidence become part of the job description?
Since I trust you.
You do?
I mean, all things considered?
If we didn't think you were right for the job, we wouldn't have offered it to you, right?
I haven't had a drink in a week, ok?
Where the hell are you going anyway?
Strange time for a vacation.
You should probably assume that it's not a vacation.
Should I even ask?
No.
I...
I'm not gonna be gone long.
Just please make sure that no one destroys the city while I'm away.
Sure.
Ok.
What are you doing?
Reviewing the SCPD evidence log on what we kept from getting stolen from Kord Industries last night.
- 6,800 processor.
- So?
Exactly.
Kord manufactures bleeding-edge tech, military-grade weapons,
I mean, all kinds of city-threatening items.
Why would Church send a guy to steal a computer chip that you could buy from any Tech Village store?
Well, who cares?
Everything's on its way to lockup now.
Because knowing what Church's endgame was is like... it's like this thing that's still out there, lurking.
You all right over there?
Because I've been doing a lot of talking, and you haven't, which is very weird.
You know how you told me to tell Rory about Havenrock?
Yeah.
Oh!
He's not sick with the flu, is he?
No.
He's just sick of working with me.
Did you try talking to him?
There's not a lot I can say that would make him feel ok about his entire family being killed.
Incoming.
Another robbery in progress at...
Palmer Tech!
I got to call Oliver.
Or maybe don't, and we'll just let the get robbed.
It will serve Mr. Dennis right for firing us.
He fired me.
You quit.
Because he fired you.
Same thing.
Sanchez, you got anything?
What's up?
Hey.
There's been a break-in at Palmer Tech.
Are you still in the area?
Uh...
Yeah.
I can look into that.
How was Palmer Tech?
Before you answer, you should consider that your phone has GPS, and if you were thinking about lying,
I do admire your consistency.
I wasn't thinking of lying to you.
I wasn't looping you in after you made it clear you didn't approve of the decision.
John is the one who doesn't approve of the plan.
John's not thinking clearly.
Well, I bet Roy is, and if he were here,
I think he would tell you that life on the run is no life at all, and I seem to remember you not being on board with that plan.
Roy was making a bad choice just like John is making a bad choice.
He is currently locked up in a military prison for a crime he didn't commit.
To atone for a crime that he did commit, and what does it matter?
John doesn't want to leave.
It is not your choice.
Why do you always have to go and make decisions for him?
He already abandoned the team.
I am not gonna let him abandon his family.
Is that what this is about,
John leaving the team?
This is simple.
I am gonna stop John from making a decision he will come to regret.
You should consider doing the exact same thing with Rory.
You do realize that me having a chat with Rory is completely different than you committing half a dozen felonies, right?
Did you ever think you'd be doing this again, handling evidence?
No.
Didn't think I'd be deputy mayor either, but here we are.
I was surprised you took the job, to be honest.
From what I hear, you and Queen have a, uh...
A complicated history.
Got to be a lot of hatchets to bury there.
Yeah.
Well, at least I know where they're buried.
That's something you can't buy or steal.
Package is here, boss.
D.A., Deputy Mayor, too.
Ah.
Bonus.
Get ready to move.
Let me guess.
Felicity filled you in.
That you're gonna break into a military prison?
Yeah, and you got the nerve to call me Wild Dog?
I'm done debating this.
Really?
Because this is the first we've heard of it.
I thought we were your team.
Running off to bust someone out of prison sounds like team business, and what happens to us when you get caught?
You've made it clear that we can't do this vigilante thing without you.
When I get caught?
I'm not gonna get caught.
Right because we're not gonna let you do this.
I'm sorry.
Did you say that you're not gonna let me?
Yes.
I need to see you physically deposit the item.
I've been on this job 15 years.
I've never lost a piece of evidence.
Now relax, Sergeant.
No one's doubting your proficiency here, ok?
Seems like.
This is it.
You gonna let me do my job now?
Have at it.
- What the hell?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Get out of here!
Find the weapons, boys.
Sorry, gents.
Load them up!
And burn this puppy down.
Let's go, let's go!
Ok.
Last chance.
Get off the street.
I didn't think he'd actually hit you guys.
You know what really sucks?
Realizing that in all those training sessions where he was kicking our respective asses the whole time he was taking it easy on us.
Yeah.
Remind me to never, ever get on his bad side.
I think that would imply that he has a good side, and, you know, Felicity, could you please explain to me again how you thought this was all gonna go down?
Well, I thought if he saw you guys all united against his crazy plan he'd reconsider.
Right because Oliver Queen is known for thinking things through and taking input from others.
Right.
The ever-expanding club house.
And who are you?
I'm Thea, Oliver's Chief of Staff.
And also his sister.
Don't tell me Oliver beat you up, too?
Heh.
Ollie did this?
Object lesson, long story.
It's fine.
Don't ask.
What happened to you?
Tobias Church happened.
That evidence that you guys recovered from Kord Industries...
Modified to go boom.
He wanted it to be put into lockup.
And he wanted to raid it.
One-stop shopping for weapons.
Including those RPGs that he took from Amertek if this report's right.
We got to find out what he's planning to do with those weapons...
Because it ain't nothing good.
This is a really bad time for Oliver to be out of town.
Yeah.
I just tried him.
He's gone dark.
Why don't you guys hit the streets?
We want to figure out what Church is up to before it's too late.
- You sure?
- Mm-hmm.
I don't think Oliver would want us out there without him.
Right.
Well, Oliver forfeited his opinion when he left.
Ok, but this is an all hands on deck situation, rag-covered hands included.
Just saying.
Where's Private Jesseman?
This is usually his delivery.
Flu's been tearing through the base, sir.
I drew the short straw.
I don't see you on the list.
Your C.O. should have submitted a change of personnel form.
You sure he didn't?
It's an hour's drive back to the base.
Can't you refresh your Wi-Fi or something?
There you are.
As you were, Private.
Thank you, sir.
I'm in.
25 minutes till extraction.
Roger that.
Facilities cameras are on a closed network.
If you can give me access to the mainframe, I can open it up.
- I'm on my way.
- Oliver...
If you don't make it to the extraction point...
I'll make it, and I won't be alone.
Hey.
You speak English?
Yes.
Your accent...
You are American.
Yeah, maybe once upon a time, but, uh, now I'm more just enjoying everything that Russia has to offer.
Yes.
I can smell that.
You judge me?
You're in this cell, too.
Yes.
A mistake my boss will correct very soon.
You mean Konstantin Kovar?
How do you know that name?
Oh, same way that I know your name's Pyotr Friedkin, same way I know that you launder money for Kovar, same way that I know that's what you're doing here.
How can you know that unless...
Are you Bratva?
He's fine.
I am Bratva, and you are gonna tell me everything that I want to know.
Your turn to run system check.
I'm gonna hit the head.
Don't touch my ball.
Dude, what the hell?
Transponder's in place.
Roger that.
I've got eyes now.
I'll walk you to Johnny's cell.
Hey!
Hey.
Is this... uh, is this a bad time?
Do I want to even ask how you found me?
Heh.
I feel like that's a trick question.
Sorry about the mess.
These are amazing.
You spend enough time with other people's castoffs, you find ways to make something useful out of them.
My father always used to say that.
He owned a pawn shop.
On Southmoor Road, right?
How'd you know?
Last week, you told Oliver that you had joined the team to honor your father.
When you quit...
I wanted to find out more about what you were giving up.
Your father was a Gulf War veteran, 2nd Battalion, 1st Marines, but that's not what made him a hero, was it?
No.
He wore your rags, like his father before him, whose name was also Rory.
That's a big legacy to live up to.
Mine is going to be what happened to Havenrock.
I'm gonna have to live with that every day for the rest of my life, knowing that I cannot fix it and knowing that it's not the last mistake that I'm ever going to have to make.
I still don't know if I can...
Work side by side with someone who's a reminder of what you lost.
I understand.
Just like you're a reminder of what I did, and I...
I know they're not the same thing.
We both want the same thing, to be able to live with what's happened so that we can move... forward.
It's Curtis.
I am so sorry, and we could really use you.
I...
I wish I could, Felicity.
I just...
I can't right now.
I'm sorry.
If you change your mind, well, we're here.
Cell 1138, right side, third from the left.
He's not here.
Give me a minute while I scan the feeds.
Oh, no.
What?
They moved him into gen pop.
You go in there, neither of you are getting out.
Talk to me.
When's he coming back to his cell?
Outside our window.
If those MPs wake up, the first thing they're gonna do is move John and all the other prisoners to a more secure location, and we lose our shot.
Abort.
We're blown.
Tell me where I can find Kovar.
You think you scare me more than him?
No, but he's not locked up in here with you.
I am.
You wouldn't kill me in front of all of them.
I'm not gonna lay a finger on you.
Same can't be said for Alisa.
Or maybe I'll visit your wife Maya when she's picking up Alisa from ballet.
Somebody... is gonna die.
It can be Kovar, it can be your wife, it can be your child, but I need you to choose and do it quickly.
Kovar is very paranoid, careful.
We never meet in person, only remotely.
Remotely?
How?
A digital dead drop, the Dark Web.
What's the IP address?
What is the IP address?
108.166.7.161.
If this information is incorrect, your family will suffer.
How does an American become this...
This...
Bratva devil?
I don't know.
About time, Blondie.
Can we go now?
First of all, not my name.
Second, were you able to locate Church on your recon?
No, but street cams actually picked him up, so we know he's on the move.
We just don't know where he's moving to.
We can't go after Church without knowing his endgame first.
Sounds like an excuse to sit around and do nothing.
What are you doing?
Not nothing.
You're cross-plotting.
Church's prior locations into a projection algorithm.
You probably got beat up in grade school a lot.
And junior high.
Ok.
Based on Church's route, I'm calculating an 86% likelihood he's going to 18 Mill Road.
Why does that sound so familiar?
Because we were just there to hand over Sergio.
That's where the ACU's bunkered.
Church is gonna take them out.
Montes, quit screwing around.
Station chief, this is Gans from cell block "C."
We have a code yellow situation.
Initiate immediate lockdown and have all prisoners return to their cells.
I'm not rolling on Church.
You think you scare me more than him?
No...
But he's not here with you.
I am.
You're not gonna put a beating on me.
You're a D.A.
Yeah.
Haven't you heard?
All of the justice in this city comes from vigilantes.
Word on the street is is that Church's planning something, something big.
You tell me what it is, and he'll be the one in those cuffs instead of you.
You're talking about the trust.
Oh, you can't stop it, man.
Can't even... come close.
What's going on?
Church.
At least we definitely know where Church is now.
D'Angelo's right.
We got to put him down.
Against that?
Without Oliver?
No.
We're sh...
Shorthanded as it is.
You scared?
No, but I'm not stupid either.
Evie's right.
I'm not sending you guys out there just to get slaughtered.
Thanks for the vote of confidence.
You saw what you're up against, ok?
This isn't some drill where you take down a petty thug or drug dealer.
This is real, ok, with real stakes.
The 3 of you could die out there.
That's something we get to decide for ourselves, isn't it?
I mean, I don't know about everyone else, but I didn't join this team to stay safe.
Ok.
Why don't we take a vote?
All those in favor.
We're all gonna say yes, Blondie.
God.
That's not my name.
Good.
Ok.
Go.
Do not die.
Code yellow.
Return all prisoners to their cells.
Code yellow.
Return all prisoners to their cells.
Immediate code yellow enforced.
Move prisoners to their cells.
Hey, John.
What's new?
I'm not doing this.
I told Lyla.
Yeah.
You can yell at us later, but right now, we're on a bit of a clock.
Are you even hearing me right now?
I don't want anything to do with this.
The MPs are gonna do a count in a few minutes.
My guess is they're only expecting to find one person in here.
Really?
So that's your play, blackmail?
Do what you say, or you get caught in here, too?
You're my brother, John.
What happens to you happens to me.
Oliver...
I killed my brother.
I went to the army to change, and I haven't changed.
I know, all right, and I know that you think this is your penance for that.
Oliver, it's not just that.
I trusted Andy.
Even when you told me not to, I trusted him, and now Laurel's dead.
I need you, the team needs you, the city needs you.
I'm not saying you shouldn't do your penance.
You probably should, but do it as Spartan.
What's in the box?
It's an antimolecular compound, and theoretically, it should eat through anything.
Not gonna ask you how you got your hands on this.
Hey.
You came back for me, even against my wishes.
I guess I haven't changed that much either.
Maybe that's what I have to do my penance for.
That toy of yours is definitely coming in handy.
Project that Lyla's been keeping an eye on for Argus.
Should have known she'd be helping out.
Tell Johnny he can thank me later.
You've got to keep moving.
Follow the sublevel north 200 meters, then climb up.
What... what is it?
Comm's being jammed.
No, no, no.
Hey.
Is there another way out of here?
Mind uncuffing me before they kill you?
Hi.
Hey.
Hey.
If that's for taking out the wall, the blast will kill us before we can get out.
We're in too tight.
- Trust me.
- Yeah, says the creepy-looking...
What the hell are you anyways?
I'm in place.
Blow it.
Sorry we blew up your building.
Come on!
We're going up.
Then what?
Which way, Overwatch?
Take a right at the end of that hallway.
It should be a fire exit.
If you go through there, you're home free easy.
Not so easy.
Rags, cover me.
Go!
Go, go!
Okay.
Get him up.
Come on.
I probably should just shoot you, but...
But you've earned a little suffering.
Get him to safety.
- But...
- Go!
It's ok.
Hey.
Don't kill him.
He may have his uses.
We've got to go back for Wild Dog.
Copy.
Overwatch, Mr. Terrific is hurt.
We could use some help.
Inbound.
Hold on.
Get in!
Where's the Wild Dog kid?
Still inside, fighting Church.
We've got to go back for him.
No.
Unless you all want to die, we've got to go now, now!
We can't just leave him.
You have to.
Go.
Come on!
Let's go.
- Here.
- What's this?
Just put it on.
Let's go.
Dig, your harness.
You two, freeze!
Down on the ground!
Lace your fingers behind your head!
Do it now, or we will shoot!
John, don't move.
This place should keep you off the grid for the time being.
Until we find a permanent solution.
Hey.
First things first.
Can't believe you broke me out of prison.
For better or worse, Johnny.
Told you I wanted to stay.
And I figured if you wanted to make your own decisions then you wouldn't haven't gotten married.
Ok.
How mad was Felicity that you went along with this?
How do you know she thought it was a bad idea?
I know Felicity.
What's wrong?
I have to go.
Hey.
When you said you haven't changed...
Don't.
Dobroye utro.
How was first night in Russian prison?
Friedkin gave up the dead drop, and now he's dead.
Mission accomplished.
Your being sarcasm, yes?
That man wasn't a threat, Anatoly.
He didn't deserve to die.
In Bratva, there is no death without purpose.
If Friedkin living, he is warning Kovar.
If he is warning Kovar, his information not so good.
Vy ponimayete?
Maybe you could have explained that to me before you sent me in there.
I almost didn't kill him.
But you did.
Why?
Because you told me to.
You trust us.
Now we trust you.
Third test over.
You get it?
You are Bratva now, family.
Last handful of honest cops in this city, and Church nearly took them out along with me.
We're just glad you're all right.
I've got to be thinking this is a PR nightmare, something like this going down and the mayor's MIA.
Look.
He called in this morning.
His health problems are almost over.
That's good news.
Um, we're... we're hearing that one of the, uh, vigilantes who was part of the rescue, that he didn't make it out.
Um, any word on him?
CSU hasn't found a body, so...
So Church has him.
I spent most of my life thinking that men in masks were only capable of doing horrible things.
I may have to reevaluate that.
Let me know when Queen gets in.
Will do.
Are you all right?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I mean, I barely knew the kid, Thea.
But that doesn't make it sting any less.
Well, yeah, sure it does.
The year I've had, this is... this is easy.
Yeah.
I mean, cold as that sounds.
Look.
I know why you're asking, ok, and I'm...
I'm fine.
Ok.
I mean, I'm...
I'm...
I'm just saying if things ever get less easy, you know I'm here for you, right?
Noted...
And appreciated.
Ok.
What is the point of having keyhole satellite imagery if you can't use it to find anybody?
I feel like I don't understand half the sentences you say.
What I'm saying is is that no matter how hard I try
I cannot find Rene anywhere.
And I was the one who told you guys to leave him behind.
Sounds like another impossible decision.
Does that mean I'm supposed to get better at making them?
I'm saying you were right.
If we're gonna do this, we can't let guilt swallow us up.
I'll keep you from doing it if you promise the same for me.
Deal.
So "ow" then?
Things have really fallen apart without Oliver, haven't they?
It's a good thing I'm back then.
Was he waiting for an entrance line?
Nope.
He's just that cool.
I got your text.
Have we found Rene?
You get John?
Yeah.
He's fine.
He's holed up at HIVE.
I couldn't write him off, and we... are not gonna write off Rene.
We're gonna find him, we're gonna bring him back...
Wherever he is.
Ah.
Wakey, wakey.
Hey.
Man, it's been a long time since I've been tagged like this.
Respect.
Oh, my pleasure, but I promise you if you untie me
I'll show you a hell of a lot more than respect.
Ooh, man, you got spirit, and I am duly impressed, but I'm gonna break that spirit.
I'm gonna break your soul, and when we're finished, assuming that you're still alive...
Now I wouldn't bet no money on that, though...
There's gonna be very little of you left for the Green Arrow to work with.
Light him up.
My name is Oliver Queen.
After 5 years in Hell,
I returned home with only one goal...
To save my city.
Today, I fight that war on two fronts.
By day, I lead Star City as its mayor, but by night, I am someone else.
I am something else.
I am the Green Arrow.
Previously on "Arrow"...
Former police Captain Quentin Lance, who will be serving beside me as Deputy Mayor.
Appreciate the vote of confidence, Mr. Mayor.
Are you not from Star City?
No.
Havenrock.
Felicity, voice-over:
There's something that I need you to know.
Havenrock was not the intended target.
Someone redirected the missile to reduce the number of casualties.
That someone was me.
Ever since I killed Andy...
You think you need to be punished.
Stop fighting for me, Lyla.
We need to talk about John.
He's back in the country, and he's in prison, and I need you to break him out.
Come on, Mr. Olympia.
Hustle up.
Mr. Olympia's a bodybuilding competition.
I was... am an Olympic athlete.
Yeah?
They give out gold medals for effort now?
Very funny, and it was a bronze medal.
Why is that so hard to remember?
Quiet.
Every time you're out in the field, you could die.
Don't forget that, don't lose focus.
Overwatch, do we have the target?
Headed toward the east exit, closing fast.
Do we know what he stole?
Not yet, but I have a feeling we're about to find out.
Only if we snag him in the cordon.
Artemis, be ready.
Does this mean I actually get to shoot someone?
I mean, not, you know, shoot someone shoot someone.
I just meant that more than...
We know what you meant.
You wait for him to reach the cordon, then engage.
Do you copy?
Copy.
- Copy.
- Copy.
Still a lot of ground to cover.
Rag's should be here.
Overwatch, do you have a 20 on Ragman?
I texted him, like, 10 times and then 10 more, but Nada.
Maybe he's sick.
I mean, the flu's been going around, and by the looks of those rags, he does not hit the drycleaner very often.
Hola, muchacho.
Wild Dog, that is Artemis' shot.
I got him.
What the?
I got him.
What did I say?
That was Artemis' shot!
Dude was getting away.
No, he wasn't.
And you missed.
You were in the Navy.
You should know better.
I was dishonorably discharged actually.
You think that I don't know that?
Deliver that and the evidence to the anti-crime unit and then go home.
What about tonight's training session?
You're taking a few days off.
Nice going... again.
How are we supposed to get this buy to the ACU, call a Uber?
Oliver.
The Op's over, and you've been MIA for days.
It's not acceptable.
Get it together immediately, or you're off the team.
That's why I'm here, to tell you in person.
I'm off the team.
Feels pretty quick to throw in the towel.
I thought you were just getting started.
I was, and then Felicity told me the truth about her role in Havenrock.
You didn't know she told me.
Did she also tell you that she was faced with an impossible choice?
I completely realize that.
I get it wasn't her fault, but that doesn't change the fact that every time I look at her
I see the faces of my family, of everyone I ever loved.
Felicity is a constant reminder of what I lost, and as long as that's true,
I'm sorry.
I can't be here.
What about your father?
I thought he was the reason you were doing this.
I'll have to find another way to honor him.
I'm sorry to lose you.
I'm sorry to go.
Thank you for everything.
Did my comms deceive me, or did you actually let the recruits take an SCPD victory lap?
It's never a victory lap.
They're... rough around the edges, but they're making progress... except Rory, who was waiting for me upstairs to say that he quit.
He said you spoke with him about Havenrock.
Hey.
How you holding up?
She doesn't know?
About John being in prison?
Oliver told me.
I'm so sorry.
What Lyla means...
We are gonna break him out.
Of military prison?
- Yep.
- Wait, and then what?
John is just a fugitive for the rest of his life?
Better than being punished for something he didn't do.
Lyla, I've been studying the schematics that you hooked me up with.
This would be a lot easier if we had John's cooperation.
U don't have what now?
Apparently, prison is more appealing to John than coming home to his own wife and child.
Ok.
So wait a minute.
Not only do you want to commit multiple felonies and make John a wanted man for the rest of his life, he doesn't actually want you to?
Can I speak with you for a minute?
Yeah.
Is she going to be a problem?
No, but...
I was counting on her being a help.
Maybe I should pull a few of my agents in on this.
No.
If this... if this has your fingerprints on it, then both of John Jr.'s parents will be fugitives.
There is something that might actually make this not impossible.
I just read a briefing memo on a new piece of tech, an antimolecular compound.
I was kind of hoping Felicity could help us get our hands on it.
Lyla, whatever it is, I'll handle it.
Second test over.
Do not make any worse by pulling out suture.
Anatoly, if this is how the Bratva treat their new members,
I'd hate to see how they treat their enemies.
Pass third and final test, find out.
What's the test?
You keep asking about Kovar.
Our sources say this man will get you one step closer.
You have to act fast, though.
He will be arraigned in morning.
Arraigned?
- Jail.
- Yeah, but... what makes you think he'll talk to me.
You trust me.
I trust you.
Look.
It's a little early for a drink, don't you think?
It's not for drinking.
Anatoly, what the hell was that for?
I should probably just start prerecording apologies for being late.
Don't worry.
Thea told us.
I'm sorry, man.
Gout is a bitch.
Yes, it is.
I'm actually gonna be taking some time off to have it taken care of.
Well, fortunately, we now have a deputy mayor to help pick up the slack.
It'll be great working with you.
You've had an impressive career, Mr. Lance?
Yeah.
I mean, a lot of people out there probably wouldn't, uh, share that opinion, but thank you.
Public service isn't easy.
Sometimes, you get a little dirty clearing out the filth.
Speaking of which, I heard there was an arrest last night that may help in our case against Tobias Church.
Sergio Espinosa, long-time Los Halcones member turned Church strongman.
The Green Arrow and his merry band of vigilantes left him gift-wrapped for us at anti-crime.
The only thing that was missing was a bow.
Well, you don't sound to happy about that.
Vigilantes are a superficial solution.
If we need their help to get our streets clean...
It means we haven't done our jobs right.
Do you think that you can get Espinosa to flip on Church?
I'll lean on him hard, see if he buckles.
Make sure he doesn't get any help from crooked cops.
Not a chance.
I'm gonna walk every piece of evidence in the custody chain through myself.
Good.
Uh, if it's all right with you,
I'll have Quentin accompany you, be my... eyes and ears while I'm out of town.
Sure.
Give us a little bit of time to get acquainted.
Heh.
Great.
I'm sorry.
When did, uh, babysitting evidence become part of the job description?
Since I trust you.
You do?
I mean, all things considered?
If we didn't think you were right for the job, we wouldn't have offered it to you, right?
I haven't had a drink in a week, ok?
Where the hell are you going anyway?
Strange time for a vacation.
You should probably assume that it's not a vacation.
Should I even ask?
No.
I...
I'm not gonna be gone long.
Just please make sure that no one destroys the city while I'm away.
Sure.
Ok.
What are you doing?
Reviewing the SCPD evidence log on what we kept from getting stolen from Kord Industries last night.
- 6,800 processor.
- So?
Exactly.
Kord manufactures bleeding-edge tech, military-grade weapons,
I mean, all kinds of city-threatening items.
Why would Church send a guy to steal a computer chip that you could buy from any Tech Village store?
Well, who cares?
Everything's on its way to lockup now.
Because knowing what Church's endgame was is like... it's like this thing that's still out there, lurking.
You all right over there?
Because I've been doing a lot of talking, and you haven't, which is very weird.
Ha!
You know how you told me to tell Rory about Havenrock?
Yeah.
Oh!
He's not sick with the flu, is he?
No.
He's just sick of working with me.
Did you try talking to him?
There's not a lot I can say that would make him feel ok about his entire family being killed.
Incoming.
Another robbery in progress at...
Palmer Tech!
I got to call Oliver.
Or maybe don't, and we'll just let the get robbed.
It will serve Mr. Dennis right for firing us.
He fired me.
You quit.
Because he fired you.
Same thing.
Sanchez, you got anything?
Nada.
What's up?
Hey.
There's been a break-in at Palmer Tech.
Are you still in the area?
Uh...
Yeah.
I can look into that.
How was Palmer Tech?
Before you answer, you should consider that your phone has GPS, and if you were thinking about lying,
I do admire your consistency.
I wasn't thinking of lying to you.
I wasn't looping you in after you made it clear you didn't approve of the decision.
John is the one who doesn't approve of the plan.
John's not thinking clearly.
Well, I bet Roy is, and if he were here,
I think he would tell you that life on the run is no life at all, and I seem to remember you not being on board with that plan.
Roy was making a bad choice just like John is making a bad choice.
He is currently locked up in a military prison for a crime he didn't commit.
To atone for a crime that he did commit, and what does it matter?
John doesn't want to leave.
It is not your choice.
Why do you always have to go and make decisions for him?
He already abandoned the team.
I am not gonna let him abandon his family.
Is that what this is about,
John leaving the team?
This is simple.
I am gonna stop John from making a decision he will come to regret.
You should consider doing the exact same thing with Rory.
You do realize that me having a chat with Rory is completely different than you committing half a dozen felonies, right?
Did you ever think you'd be doing this again, handling evidence?
No.
Didn't think I'd be deputy mayor either, but here we are.
I was surprised you took the job, to be honest.
From what I hear, you and Queen have a, uh...
A complicated history.
Got to be a lot of hatchets to bury there.
Yeah.
Well, at least I know where they're buried.
That's something you can't buy or steal.
Package is here, boss.
D.A., Deputy Mayor, too.
Ah.
Bonus.
Get ready to move.
Let me guess.
Felicity filled you in.
That you're gonna break into a military prison?
Yeah, and you got the nerve to call me Wild Dog?
I'm done debating this.
Really?
Because this is the first we've heard of it.
I thought we were your team.
Running off to bust someone out of prison sounds like team business, and what happens to us when you get caught?
You've made it clear that we can't do this vigilante thing without you.
When I get caught?
I'm not gonna get caught.
Right because we're not gonna let you do this.
I'm sorry.
Did you say that you're not gonna let me?
Yes.
I need to see you physically deposit the item.
I've been on this job 15 years.
I've never lost a piece of evidence.
Now relax, Sergeant.
No one's doubting your proficiency here, ok?
Seems like.
This is it.
You gonna let me do my job now?
Have at it.
- What the hell?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Get out of here!
Whoo!
Find the weapons, boys.
Ahh.
Sorry, gents.
Load them up!
And burn this puppy down.
Let's go, let's go!
Ok.
Last chance.
Get off the street.
I didn't think he'd actually hit you guys.
You know what really sucks?
Realizing that in all those training sessions where he was kicking our respective asses the whole time he was taking it easy on us.
Yeah.
Remind me to never, ever get on his bad side.
I think that would imply that he has a good side, and, you know, Felicity, could you please explain to me again how you thought this was all gonna go down?
Well, I thought if he saw you guys all united against his crazy plan he'd reconsider.
Right because Oliver Queen is known for thinking things through and taking input from others.
Right.
Wow.
The ever-expanding club house.
And who are you?
I'm Thea, Oliver's Chief of Staff.
And also his sister.
Don't tell me Oliver beat you up, too?
Heh.
Ollie did this?
Object lesson, long story.
It's fine.
Don't ask.
What happened to you?
Tobias Church happened.
That evidence that you guys recovered from Kord Industries...
Modified to go boom.
He wanted it to be put into lockup.
And he wanted to raid it.
One-stop shopping for weapons.
Including those RPGs that he took from Amertek if this report's right.
We got to find out what he's planning to do with those weapons...
Because it ain't nothing good.
This is a really bad time for Oliver to be out of town.
Yeah.
I just tried him.
He's gone dark.
Why don't you guys hit the streets?
We want to figure out what Church is up to before it's too late.
- You sure?
- Mm-hmm.
I don't think Oliver would want us out there without him.
Right.
Well, Oliver forfeited his opinion when he left.
Ok, but this is an all hands on deck situation, rag-covered hands included.
Just saying.
Where's Private Jesseman?
This is usually his delivery.
Flu's been tearing through the base, sir.
I drew the short straw.
I don't see you on the list.
Your C.O. should have submitted a change of personnel form.
You sure he didn't?
It's an hour's drive back to the base.
Can't you refresh your Wi-Fi or something?
There you are.
As you were, Private.
Thank you, sir.
I'm in.
25 minutes till extraction.
Roger that.
Facilities cameras are on a closed network.
If you can give me access to the mainframe, I can open it up.
- I'm on my way.
- Oliver...
If you don't make it to the extraction point...
I'll make it, and I won't be alone.
Ahem.
Ohh.
Ahh.
Hey.
You speak English?
Yes.
Your accent...
You are American.
Yeah, maybe once upon a time, but, uh, now I'm more just enjoying everything that Russia has to offer.
Yes.
I can smell that.
You judge me?
You're in this cell, too.
Yes.
A mistake my boss will correct very soon.
You mean Konstantin Kovar?
How do you know that name?
Oh, same way that I know your name's Pyotr Friedkin, same way I know that you launder money for Kovar, same way that I know that's what you're doing here.
How can you know that unless...
Are you Bratva?
He's fine.
Mmm.
I am Bratva, and you are gonna tell me everything that I want to know.
Your turn to run system check.
I'm gonna hit the head.
Don't touch my ball.
Dude, what the hell?
Transponder's in place.
Roger that.
I've got eyes now.
I'll walk you to Johnny's cell.
Hey!
Hey.
Is this... uh, is this a bad time?
Do I want to even ask how you found me?
Heh.
I feel like that's a trick question.
Sorry about the mess.
Wow!
These are amazing.
You spend enough time with other people's castoffs, you find ways to make something useful out of them.
My father always used to say that.
He owned a pawn shop.
On Southmoor Road, right?
How'd you know?
Last week, you told Oliver that you had joined the team to honor your father.
When you quit...
I wanted to find out more about what you were giving up.
Your father was a Gulf War veteran, 2nd Battalion, 1st Marines, but that's not what made him a hero, was it?
No.
He wore your rags, like his father before him, whose name was also Rory.
That's a big legacy to live up to.
Mine is going to be what happened to Havenrock.
I'm gonna have to live with that every day for the rest of my life, knowing that I cannot fix it and knowing that it's not the last mistake that I'm ever going to have to make.
I still don't know if I can...
Work side by side with someone who's a reminder of what you lost.
I understand.
Just like you're a reminder of what I did, and I...
I know they're not the same thing.
We both want the same thing, to be able to live with what's happened so that we can move... forward.
It's Curtis.
I am so sorry, and we could really use you.
I...
I wish I could, Felicity.
I just...
I can't right now.
I'm sorry.
If you change your mind, well, we're here.
Cell 1138, right side, third from the left.
He's not here.
Give me a minute while I scan the feeds.
Oh, no.

What?
They moved him into gen pop.
You go in there, neither of you are getting out.
Talk to me.
When's he coming back to his cell?
Outside our window.
If those MPs wake up, the first thing they're gonna do is move John and all the other prisoners to a more secure location, and we lose our shot.
Abort.
We're blown.
Tell me where I can find Kovar.
You think you scare me more than him?
No, but he's not locked up in here with you.
I am.
You wouldn't kill me in front of all of them.
I'm not gonna lay a finger on you.
Same can't be said for Alisa.
Or maybe I'll visit your wife Maya when she's picking up Alisa from ballet.
Somebody... is gonna die.
It can be Kovar, it can be your wife, it can be your child, but I need you to choose and do it quickly.
Kovar is very paranoid, careful.
We never meet in person, only remotely.
Remotely?
How?
A digital dead drop, the Dark Web.
What's the IP address?
What is the IP address?
108.166.7.161.
If this information is incorrect, your family will suffer.
How does an American become this...
This...
Bratva devil?
I don't know.
About time, Blondie.
Can we go now?
First of all, not my name.
Second, were you able to locate Church on your recon?
No, but street cams actually picked him up, so we know he's on the move.
We just don't know where he's moving to.
We can't go after Church without knowing his endgame first.
Sounds like an excuse to sit around and do nothing.
What are you doing?
Not nothing.
You're cross-plotting.
Church's prior locations into a projection algorithm.
Hmm.
You probably got beat up in grade school a lot.
And junior high.
Ok.
Based on Church's route, I'm calculating an 86% likelihood he's going to 18 Mill Road.
Why does that sound so familiar?
Because we were just there to hand over Sergio.
That's where the ACU's bunkered.
Church is gonna take them out.
Montes, quit screwing around.
Station chief, this is Gans from cell block "C."
We have a code yellow situation.
Initiate immediate lockdown and have all prisoners return to their cells.
I'm not rolling on Church.
You think you scare me more than him?
Hmm.
No...
But he's not here with you.
I am.
Hmm.
You're not gonna put a beating on me.
You're a D.A.
Yeah.
Haven't you heard?
All of the justice in this city comes from vigilantes.
Word on the street is is that Church's planning something, something big.
You tell me what it is, and he'll be the one in those cuffs instead of you.
Heh heh heh.
You're talking about the trust.
Oh, you can't stop it, man.
Can't even... come close.
What's going on?
Church.
At least we definitely know where Church is now.
D'Angelo's right.
We got to put him down.
Against that?
Without Oliver?
No.
We're sh...
Shorthanded as it is.
You scared?
No, but I'm not stupid either.
Evie's right.
I'm not sending you guys out there just to get slaughtered.
Thanks for the vote of confidence.
You saw what you're up against, ok?
This isn't some drill where you take down a petty thug or drug dealer.
This is real, ok, with real stakes.
The 3 of you could die out there.
That's something we get to decide for ourselves, isn't it?
I mean, I don't know about everyone else, but I didn't join this team to stay safe.
Ok.
Why don't we take a vote?
All those in favor.
We're all gonna say yes, Blondie.
God.
That's not my name.
Good.
Ok.
Go.
Do not die.
Code yellow.
Return all prisoners to their cells.
Code yellow.
Return all prisoners to their cells.
Immediate code yellow enforced.
Move prisoners to their cells.
Hey, John.
What's new?
I'm not doing this.
I told Lyla.
Yeah.
You can yell at us later, but right now, we're on a bit of a clock.
Are you even hearing me right now?
I don't want anything to do with this.
The MPs are gonna do a count in a few minutes.
My guess is they're only expecting to find one person in here.
Really?
So that's your play, blackmail?
Do what you say, or you get caught in here, too?
You're my brother, John.
What happens to you happens to me.
Oliver...
I killed my brother.
I went to the army to change, and I haven't changed.
I know, all right, and I know that you think this is your penance for that.
Oliver, it's not just that.
I trusted Andy.
Even when you told me not to, I trusted him, and now Laurel's dead.
I need you, the team needs you, the city needs you.
I'm not saying you shouldn't do your penance.
You probably should, but do it as Spartan.
What's in the box?
It's an antimolecular compound, and theoretically, it should eat through anything.
Not gonna ask you how you got your hands on this.
Hey.
You came back for me, even against my wishes.
I guess I haven't changed that much either.
Maybe that's what I have to do my penance for.
That toy of yours is definitely coming in handy.
Project that Lyla's been keeping an eye on for Argus.
Should have known she'd be helping out.
Tell Johnny he can thank me later.
You've got to keep moving.
Follow the sublevel north 200 meters, then climb up.
What... what is it?
Comm's being jammed.
No, no, no.
Hey.
Is there another way out of here?
Mind uncuffing me before they kill you?
Hi.
Hey.
Hey.
If that's for taking out the wall, the blast will kill us before we can get out.
We're in too tight.
- Trust me.
- Yeah, says the creepy-looking...
What the hell are you anyways?
I'm in place.
Blow it.
Sorry we blew up your building.
Come on!
We're going up.
Then what?
Which way, Overwatch?
Take a right at the end of that hallway.
It should be a fire exit.
If you go through there, you're home free easy.
Not so easy.
Rags, cover me.
Go!
Go, go!
Unh!
Okay.
Get him up.
Come on.
I probably should just shoot you, but...
But you've earned a little suffering.
Get him to safety.
- But...
- Go!
It's ok.
Hey.
Don't kill him.
He may have his uses.
We've got to go back for Wild Dog.
Copy.
Overwatch, Mr. Terrific is hurt.
We could use some help.
Inbound.
Hold on.
Get in!
Where's the Wild Dog kid?
Still inside, fighting Church.
We've got to go back for him.
No.
Unless you all want to die, we've got to go now, now!
We can't just leave him.
You have to.
Go.
Come on!
Let's go.
- Here.
- What's this?
Just put it on.
Let's go.
Dig, your harness.
You two, freeze!
Down on the ground!
Lace your fingers behind your head!
Do it now, or we will shoot!
John, don't move.
This place should keep you off the grid for the time being.
Until we find a permanent solution.
Hey.
First things first.
Can't believe you broke me out of prison.
For better or worse, Johnny.
Told you I wanted to stay.
And I figured if you wanted to make your own decisions then you wouldn't haven't gotten married.
Ok.
How mad was Felicity that you went along with this?
How do you know she thought it was a bad idea?
I know Felicity.
What's wrong?
I have to go.
Hey.
When you said you haven't changed...
Don't.
Dobroye utro.
How was first night in Russian prison?
Friedkin gave up the dead drop, and now he's dead.
Mission accomplished.
Your being sarcasm, yes?
That man wasn't a threat, Anatoly.
He didn't deserve to die.
In Bratva, there is no death without purpose.
If Friedkin living, he is warning Kovar.
If he is warning Kovar, his information not so good.
Vy ponimayete?
Maybe you could have explained that to me before you sent me in there.
I almost didn't kill him.
But you did.
Why?
Because you told me to.
You trust us.
Now we trust you.
Third test over.
You get it?
You are Bratva now, family.
Last handful of honest cops in this city, and Church nearly took them out along with me.
We're just glad you're all right.
I've got to be thinking this is a PR nightmare, something like this going down and the mayor's MIA.
Look.
He called in this morning.
His health problems are almost over.
That's good news.
Um, we're... we're hearing that one of the, uh, vigilantes who was part of the rescue, that he didn't make it out.
Um, any word on him?
CSU hasn't found a body, so...
So Church has him.
I spent most of my life thinking that men in masks were only capable of doing horrible things.
I may have to reevaluate that.
Let me know when Queen gets in.
Will do.
Are you all right?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I mean, I barely knew the kid, Thea.
But that doesn't make it sting any less.
Well, yeah, sure it does.
The year I've had, this is... this is easy.
Yeah.
I mean, cold as that sounds.
Look.
I know why you're asking, ok, and I'm...
I'm fine.
Ok.
I mean, I'm...
I'm...
I'm just saying if things ever get less easy, you know I'm here for you, right?
Noted...
And appreciated.
Ok.
What is the point of having keyhole satellite imagery if you can't use it to find anybody?
I feel like I don't understand half the sentences you say.
What I'm saying is is that no matter how hard I try
I cannot find Rene anywhere.
And I was the one who told you guys to leave him behind.
Sounds like another impossible decision.
Does that mean I'm supposed to get better at making them?
I'm saying you were right.
If we're gonna do this, we can't let guilt swallow us up.
I'll keep you from doing it if you promise the same for me.
Deal.
Ow!
Ow!
Ow!
So "ow" then?
Things have really fallen apart without Oliver, haven't they?
It's a good thing I'm back then.
Was he waiting for an entrance line?
Nope.
He's just that cool.
I got your text.
Have we found Rene?
You get John?
Yeah.
He's fine.
He's holed up at HIVE.
I couldn't write him off, and we... are not gonna write off Rene.
We're gonna find him, we're gonna bring him back...
Wherever he is.
Ah.
Wakey, wakey.
Yow!
Yow!
Heh heh heh.
Hey.
Man, it's been a long time since I've been tagged like this.
Respect.
Oh, my pleasure, but I promise you if you untie me
I'll show you a hell of a lot more than respect.
Ooh, man, you got spirit, and I am duly impressed, but I'm gonna break that spirit.
I'm gonna break your soul, and when we're finished, assuming that you're still alive...
Now I wouldn't bet no money on that, though...
There's gonna be very little of you left for the Green Arrow to work with.
Light him up.
Greg!
Move your head.
Oliver:
My name is Oliver Queen.
After 5 years in Hell,
I returned home with only one goal-- to save my city.
Today, I fight that war on two fronts.
By day, I lead Star City as its mayor, but by night, I am someone else.
I am something else.
I am the Green Arrow.
Previously on "Arrow"...
Former police Captain Quentin Lance, who will be serving beside me as Deputy Mayor.
Appreciate the vote of confidence, Mr. Mayor.
Are you not from Star City?
No.
Havenrock.
Felicity, voice-over:
There's something that I need you to know.
Havenrock was not the intended target.
Someone redirected the missile to reduce the number of casualties.
That someone was me.
Ever since I killed Andy...
You think you need to be punished.
Stop fighting for me, Lyla.
Lyla:
We need to talk about John.
He's back in the country, and he's in prison, and I need you to break him out.
Rene:
Come on, Mr. Olympia.
Hustle up.
Mr. Olympia's a bodybuilding competition.
I was--am an Olympic athlete.
Yeah?
They give out gold medals for effort now?
Curtis:
Very funny, and it was a bronze medal.
Why is that so hard to remember?
Oliver:
Quiet.
Every time you're out in the field, you could die.
Don't forget that, don't lose focus.
Overwatch, do we have the target?
Headed toward the east exit, closing fast.
Do we know what he stole?
Not yet, but I have a feeling we're about to find out.
Only if we snag him in the cordon.
Artemis, be ready.
Does this mean I actually get to shoot someone?
I mean, not, you know, shoot someone shoot someone.
I just meant that more than--
Oliver:
We know what you meant.
You wait for him to reach the cordon, then engage.
- Do you copy?
- Copy.
Curtis:
Copy.
Rene:
Copy.
Still a lot of ground to cover.
Rag's should be here.
Oliver:
Overwatch, do you have a 20 on Ragman?
I texted him, like, 10 times and then 10 more, but Nada.
Maybe he's sick.
I mean, the flu's been going around, and by the looks of those rags, he does not hit the drycleaner very often.
[Door opens]
Hola, muchacho.
Wild Dog, that is Artemis' shot.
I got him.
[Gunshots]
What the?
I got him.
[Gunshots continue]
What did I say?
That was Artemis' shot!
Dude was getting away.
No, he wasn't.
And you missed.
You were in the Navy.
You should know better.
I was dishonorably discharged actually.
You think that I don't know that?
Deliver that and the evidence to the anti-crime unit and then go home.
What about tonight's training session?
You're taking a few days off.
Evelyn:
Nice going...again.
How are we supposed to get this buy to the ACU, call a Uber?

[Door slams]
Oliver.
The Op's over, and you've been MIA for days.
It's not acceptable.
Get it together immediately, or you're off the team.
That's why I'm here, to tell you in person.
I'm off the team.
Feels pretty quick to throw in the towel.
I thought you were just getting started.
I was, and then Felicity told me the truth about her role in Havenrock.
You didn't know she told me.
Did she also tell you that she was faced with an impossible choice?
I completely realize that.
I get it wasn't her fault, but that doesn't change the fact that every time I look at her
I see the faces of my family, of everyone I ever loved.
Felicity is a constant reminder of what I lost, and as long as that's true,
I'm sorry.
I can't be here.
What about your father?
I thought he was the reason you were doing this.
I'll have to find another way to honor him.
I'm sorry to lose you.
I'm sorry to go.
Thank you for everything.
Felicity:
Did my comms deceive me, or did you actually let the recruits take an SCPD victory lap?
It's never a victory lap.
They're rough around the edges, but they're making progress except Rory, who was waiting for me upstairs to say that he quit.
He said you spoke with him about Havenrock.
Hey.
How you holding up?
She doesn't know?
About John being in prison?
Oliver told me.
I'm so sorry.
What Lyla means-- we are gonna break him out.
Of military prison?
- Yep.
- Wait, and then what?
John is just a fugitive for the rest of his life?
Better than being punished for something he didn't do.
Lyla, I've been studying the schematics that you hooked me up with.
This would be a lot easier if we had John's cooperation.
U don't have what now?
Apparently, prison is more appealing to John than coming home to his own wife and child.
Ok.
So wait a minute.
Not only do you want to commit multiple felonies and make John a wanted man for the rest of his life, he doesn't actually want you to?
Can I speak with you for a minute?
Yeah.
Is she going to be a problem?
No, but...
I was counting on her being a help.
Maybe I should pull a few of my agents in on this.
No.
If this--if this has your fingerprints on it, then both of John Jr.'s parents will be fugitives.
There is something that might actually make this not impossible.
I just read a briefing memo on a new piece of tech, an antimolecular compound.
I was kind of hoping Felicity could help us get our hands on it.
Lyla, whatever it is, I'll handle it.
Anatoly:
Second test over.
Do not make any worse by pulling out suture.
Anatoly, if this is how the Bratva treat their new members,
I'd hate to see how they treat their enemies.
Pass third and final test, find out.
What's the test?
You keep asking about Kovar.
Our sources say this man will get you one step closer.
You have to act fast, though.
He will be arraigned in morning.
Arraigned?
- Jail.
- Yeah, but what makes you think he'll talk to me.
You trust me.
I trust you.
Look.
It's a little early for a drink, don't you think?
It's not for drinking.
Anatoly, what the hell was that for?
I should probably just start prerecording apologies for being late.
Don't worry.
Thea told us.
I'm sorry, man.
Gout is a bitch.
Yes, it is.
I'm actually gonna be taking some time off to have it taken care of.
Well, fortunately, we now have a deputy mayor to help pick up the slack.
It'll be great working with you.
You've had an impressive career, Mr. Lance?
Yeah.
I mean, a lot of people out there probably wouldn't, uh, share that opinion, but thank you.
Public service isn't easy.
Sometimes, you get a little dirty clearing out the filth.
Speaking of which, I heard there was an arrest last night that may help in our case against Tobias Church.
Sergio Espinosa, long-time Los Halcones member turned Church strongman.
The Green Arrow and his merry band of vigilantes left him gift-wrapped for us at anti-crime.
The only thing that was missing was a bow.
Well, you don't sound to happy about that.
Vigilantes are a superficial solution.
If we need their help to get our streets clean--
It means we haven't done our jobs right.
Do you think that you can get Espinosa to flip on Church?
I'll lean on him hard, see if he buckles.
Make sure he doesn't get any help from crooked cops.
Not a chance.
I'm gonna walk every piece of evidence in the custody chain through myself.
Good.
Uh, if it's all right with you,
I'll have Quentin accompany you, be my eyes and ears while I'm out of town.
Sure.
Give us a little bit of time to get acquainted.
Heh.
Great.
I'm sorry.
When did, uh, babysitting evidence become part of the job description?
Since I trust you.
You do?
I mean, all things considered?
If we didn't think you were right for the job, we wouldn't have offered it to you, right?
I haven't had a drink in a week, ok?
Where the hell are you going anyway?
Strange time for a vacation.
You should probably assume that it's not a vacation.
Should I even ask?
No.
I--I'm not gonna be gone long.
Just please make sure that no one destroys the city while I'm away.
Sure.
Ok.
Felicity:
What are you doing?
Reviewing the SCPD evidence log on what we kept from getting stolen from Kord Industries last night.
- 6,800 processor.
- So?
Exactly.
Kord manufactures bleeding-edge tech, military-grade weapons,
I mean, all kinds of city-threatening items.
Why would Church send a guy to steal a computer chip that you could buy from any Tech Village store?
Well, who cares?
Everything's on its way to lockup now.
Because knowing what Church's endgame was is like--it's like this thing that's still out there, lurking.
You all right over there?
Because I've been doing a lot of talking, and you haven't, which is very weird.
Ha!
You know how you told me to tell Rory about Havenrock?
Yeah.
Oh!
He's not sick with the flu, is he?
No.
He's just sick of working with me.
Did you try talking to him?
There's not a lot I can say that would make him feel ok about his entire family being killed.
[Computer beeps]
Incoming.
Another robbery in progress at--
Palmer Tech!
I got to call Oliver.
Or maybe don't, and we'll just let the get robbed.
It will serve Mr. Dennis right for firing us.
He fired me.
You quit.
Because he fired you.
Same thing.
[Alarm blaring]
Man on radio:
Sanchez, you got anything?
Nada.
[Cell phone rings]
What's up?
Hey.
There's been a break-in at Palmer Tech.
Are you still in the area?
Uh...
Yeah.
I can look into that.
How was Palmer Tech?
Before you answer, you should consider that your phone has GPS, and if you were thinking about lying,
I do admire your consistency.
I wasn't thinking of lying to you.
I wasn't looping you in after you made it clear you didn't approve of the decision.
John is the one who doesn't approve of the plan.
John's not thinking clearly.
Well, I bet Roy is, and if he were here,
I think he would tell you that life on the run is no life at all, and I seem to remember you not being on board with that plan.
Roy was making a bad choice just like John is making a bad choice.
He is currently locked up in a military prison for a crime he didn't commit.
To atone for a crime that he did commit, and what does it matter?
John doesn't want to leave.
It is not your choice.
Why do you always have to go and make decisions for him?
He already abandoned the team.
I am not gonna let him abandon his family.
Is that what this is about,
John leaving the team?
This is simple.
I am gonna stop John from making a decision he will come to regret.
You should consider doing the exact same thing with Rory.
You do realize that me having a chat with Rory is completely different than you committing half a dozen felonies, right?
Did you ever think you'd be doing this again, handling evidence?
No.
Didn't think I'd be deputy mayor either, but here we are.
I was surprised you took the job, to be honest.
From what I hear, you and Queen have a, uh-- a complicated history.
Got to be a lot of hatchets to bury there.
Yeah.
Well, at least I know where they're buried.
That's something you can't buy or steal.
Package is here, boss.
D.A., Deputy Mayor, too.
Ah.
Bonus.
Get ready to move.
[Tires squeal]
Let me guess.
Felicity filled you in.
That you're gonna break into a military prison?
Yeah, and you got the nerve to call me Wild Dog?
I'm done debating this.
Evelyn:
Really?
Because this is the first we've heard of it.
I thought we were your team.
Running off to bust someone out of prison sounds like team business, and what happens to us when you get caught?
You've made it clear that we can't do this vigilante thing without you.
When I get caught?
I'm not gonna get caught.
Curtis:
Right because we're not gonna let you do this.
I'm sorry.
Did you say that you're not gonna let me?
Yes.
I need to see you physically deposit the item.
I've been on this job 15 years.
I've never lost a piece of evidence.
Now relax, Sergeant.
No one's doubting your proficiency here, ok?
Seems like.
[Whistling]
This is it.
You gonna let me do my job now?
Have at it.
[Case humming]
- What the hell?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Get out of here!
[Alarm blaring]
Church:
Whoo!
Find the weapons, boys.
Ahh.
Sorry, gents.
Load them up!
And burn this puppy down.
Church:
Let's go, let's go!
Ok.
Last chance.
Get off the street.
I didn't think he'd actually hit you guys.
Rene:
You know what really sucks?
Curtis:
Realizing that in all those training sessions where he was kicking our respective asses the whole time he was taking it easy on us.
Evelyn:
Yeah.
Remind me to never, ever get on his bad side.
Curtis:
I think that would imply that he has a good side, and, you know, Felicity, could you please explain to me again how you thought this was all gonna go down?
Well, I thought if he saw you guys all united against his crazy plan he'd reconsider.
Right because Oliver Queen is known for thinking things through and taking input from others.
Right.
Wow.
The ever-expanding club house.
And who are you?
I'm Thea, Oliver's Chief of Staff.
And also his sister.
Don't tell me Oliver beat you up, too?
Heh.
Ollie did this?
Object lesson, long story.
It's fine.
Don't ask.
What happened to you?
Tobias Church happened.
That evidence that you guys recovered from Kord Industries-- modified to go boom.
He wanted it to be put into lockup.
And he wanted to raid it.
One-stop shopping for weapons.
Including those RPGs that he took from Amertek if this report's right.
We got to find out what he's planning to do with those weapons-- because it ain't nothing good.
This is a really bad time for Oliver to be out of town.
Yeah.
I just tried him.
He's gone dark.
Why don't you guys hit the streets?
We want to figure out what Church is up to before it's too late.
- You sure?
- Mm-hmm.
I don't think Oliver would want us out there without him.
Right.
Well, Oliver forfeited his opinion when he left.
Ok, but this is an all hands on deck situation, rag-covered hands included.
Just saying.
Where's Private Jesseman?
This is usually his delivery.
Flu's been tearing through the base, sir.
I drew the short straw.
I don't see you on the list.
Your C.O. should have submitted a change of personnel form.
You sure he didn't?
It's an hour's drive back to the base.
Can't you refresh your Wi-Fi or something?
There you are.
As you were, Private.
Thank you, sir.
[Beep]
I'm in.
25 minutes till extraction.
Roger that.
Facilities cameras are on a closed network.
If you can give me access to the mainframe, I can open it up.
- I'm on my way.
- Oliver...
If you don't make it to the extraction point--
I'll make it, and I won't be alone.
Ahem.
Ohh.
Ahh.
Hey.
You speak English?
Yes.
Your accent-- you are American.
Yeah, maybe once upon a time, but, uh, now I'm more just enjoying everything that Russia has to offer.
Yes.
I can smell that.
You judge me?
You're in this cell, too.
Yes.
A mistake my boss will correct very soon.
You mean Konstantin Kovar?
How do you know that name?
Oh, same way that I know your name's Pyotr Friedkin, same way I know that you launder money for Kovar, same way that I know that's what you're doing here.
How can you know that unless...
Are you Bratva?
[Gags]
[Coughing]
He's fine.
Mmm.
I am Bratva, and you are gonna tell me everything that I want to know.
Your turn to run system check.
I'm gonna hit the head.
Don't touch my ball.
[Beep]
[Beep]
Dude, what the hell?
Transponder's in place.
Roger that.
I've got eyes now.
I'll walk you to Johnny's cell.
Hey!
Hey.
Is this--uh, is this a bad time?
Do I want to even ask how you found me?
Heh.
I feel like that's a trick question.
Sorry about the mess.
Wow!
These are amazing.
You spend enough time with other people's castoffs, you find ways to make something useful out of them.
My father always used to say that.
He owned a pawn shop.
On Southmoor Road, right?
How'd you know?
Last week, you told Oliver that you had joined the team to honor your father.
When you quit...
I wanted to find out more about what you were giving up.
Your father was a Gulf War veteran, 2nd Battalion, 1st Marines, but that's not what made him a hero, was it?
No.
He wore your rags, his father before him, whose name was also Rory.
That's a big legacy to live up to.
Mine is going to be what happened to Havenrock.
I'm gonna have to live with that every day for the rest of my life, knowing that I cannot fix it and knowing that it's not the last mistake that I'm ever going to have to make.
I still don't know if I can--
Work side by side with someone who's a reminder of what you lost.
I understand.
Just like you're a reminder of what I did, and I--I know they're not the same thing.
We both want the same thing, to be able to live with what's happened so that we can move forward.
[Cell phone vibrating]
It's Curtis.
I am so sorry, and we could really use you.
I--I wish I could, Felicity.
I just...
I can't right now.
I'm sorry.
If you change your mind, well, we're here.
Lyla:
Cell 1138, right side, third from the left.
He's not here.
Give me a minute while I scan the feeds.
Oh, no.
What?
They moved him into gen pop.
You go in there, neither of you are getting out.
Talk to me.
When's he coming back to his cell?
Outside our window.
If those MPs wake up, the first thing they're gonna do is move John and all the other prisoners to a more secure location, and we lose our shot.
Abort.
We're blown.
Tell me where I can find Kovar.
You think you scare me more than him?
No, but he's not locked up in here with you.
I am.
You wouldn't kill me in front of all of them.
I'm not gonna lay a finger on you.
Same can't be said for Alisa.
Or maybe I'll visit your wife Maya when she's picking up Alisa from ballet.
Somebody is gonna die.
It can be Kovar, it can be your wife, it can be your child, but I need you to choose and do it quickly.
Kovar is very paranoid, careful.
We never meet in person, only remotely.
Remotely?
How?
A digital dead drop, the Dark Web.
What's the IP address?
What is the IP address?
108.166.7.161.
If this information is incorrect, your family will suffer.
How does an American become this...
This...
Bratva devil?
I don't know.
[Bones crack]
About time, Blondie.
Can we go now?
First of all, not my name.
Second, were you able to locate Church on your recon?
No, but street cams actually picked him up, so we know he's on the move.
We just don't know where he's moving to.
We can't go after Church without knowing his endgame first.
Sounds like an excuse to sit around and do nothing.
What are you doing?
Not nothing.
Curtis:
You're cross-plotting
Church's prior locations into a projection algorithm.
Hmm.
You probably got beat up in grade school a lot.
And junior high.
Ok.
Based on Church's route, I'm calculating an 86% likelihood he's going to 18 Mill Road.
Why does that sound so familiar?
Because we were just there to hand over Sergio.
That's where the ACU's bunkered.
Church is gonna take them out.
Montes, quit screwing around.
Station chief, this is Gans from cell block "C."
We have a code yellow situation.
Initiate immediate lockdown and have all prisoners return to their cells.
I'm not rolling on Church.
You think you scare me more than him?
Hmm.
No...
But he's not here with you.
I am.
Hmm.
You're not gonna put a beating on me.
You're a D.A.
Yeah.
Haven't you heard?
All of the justice in this city comes from vigilantes.
Word on the street is is that Church's planning something, something big.
You tell me what it is, and he'll be the one in those cuffs instead of you.
Heh heh heh.
You're talking about the trust.
Oh, you can't stop it, man.
Can't even come close.
What's going on?
[Machineguns firing]
Church.
At least we definitely know where Church is now.
D'Angelo's right.
We got to put him down.
Evelyn:
Against that?
Without Oliver?
No.
We're sh-- shorthanded as it is.
You scared?
No, but I'm not stupid either.
Evie's right.
I'm not sending you guys out there just to get slaughtered.
Thanks for the vote of confidence.
You saw what you're up against, ok?
This isn't some drill where you take down a petty thug or drug dealer.
This is real, ok, with real stakes.
The 3 of you could die out there.
Rory:
That's something we get to decide for ourselves, isn't it?
I mean, I don't know about everyone else, but I didn't join this team to stay safe.
Ok.
Why don't we take a vote?
All those in favor.
Rene:
We're all gonna say yes, Blondie.
God.
That's not my name.
Good.
Ok.
Go.
Do not die.
Man on P.A.:
Code yellow.
Return all prisoners to their cells.
Code yellow.
Return all prisoners to their cells.
Immediate code yellow enforced.
Move prisoners to their cells.
[Alarm blaring]
Hey, John.
What's new?
I'm not doing this.
I told Lyla.
Yeah.
You can yell at us later, but right now, we're on a bit of a clock.
Are you even hearing me right now?
I don't want anything to do with this.
The MPs are gonna do a count in a few minutes.
My guess is they're only expecting to find one person in here.
Really?
So that's your play, blackmail?
Do what you say, or you get caught in here, too?
You're my brother, John.
What happens to you happens to me.
Oliver...
I killed my brother.
I went to the army to change, and I haven't changed.
I know, all right, and I know that you think this is your penance for that.
Oliver, it's not just that.
I trusted Andy.
Even when you told me not to, I trusted him, and now Laurel's dead.
I need you, the team needs you, the city needs you.
I'm not saying you shouldn't do your penance.
You probably should, but do it as Spartan.
What's in the box?
It's an antimolecular compound, and theoretically, it should eat through anything.
Not gonna ask you how you got your hands on this.
Hey.
You came back for me, even against my wishes.
I guess I haven't changed that much either.
Maybe that's what I have to do my penance for.
That toy of yours is definitely coming in handy.
Project that Lyla's been keeping an eye on for Argus.
Should have known she'd be helping out.
Tell Johnny he can thank me later.
You've got to keep moving.
Follow the sublevel north 200 meters, then climb up.
[Static]
What--what is it?
Comm's being jammed.
[Alarm blaring]
Adrian:
No, no, no.
Hey.
Is there another way out of here?
Mind uncuffing me before they kill you?
Rory:
Hi.
Adrian:
Hey.
Hey.
If that's for taking out the wall, the blast will kill us before we can get out.
We're in too tight.
- Trust me.
- Yeah, says the creepy-looking--
What the hell are you anyways?
I'm in place.
Blow it.
Sorry we blew up your building.
Come on!
We're going up.
Then what?
[Gunshots]
Which way, Overwatch?
Take a right at the end of that hallway.
It should be a fire exit.
If you go through there, you're home free easy.
Not so easy.
Rags, cover me.
Go!
Go, go!
Unh!
Get him up.
Come on.
[Groans]
I probably should just shoot you, but...
But you've earned a little suffering.
Get him to safety.
- But--
- Go!
It's ok.
Hey.
Don't kill him.
He may have his uses.
We've got to go back for Wild Dog.
Copy.
Overwatch, Mr. Terrific is hurt.
We could use some help.
Inbound.
Hold on.
Get in!
Where's the Wild Dog kid?
Still inside, fighting Church.
We've got to go back for him.
No.
Unless you all want to die, we've got to go now, now!
We can't just leave him.
You have to.
Go.
Come on!
Let's go.
- Here.
- What's this?
Just put it on.
Let's go.
Dig, your harness.
You two, freeze!
Down on the ground!
Lace your fingers behind your head!
Do it now, or we will shoot!
John, don't move.
This place should keep you off the grid for the time being.
Until we find a permanent solution.
Hey.
First things first.
Can't believe you broke me out of prison.
For better or worse, Johnny.
Told you I wanted to stay.
And I figured if you wanted to make your own decisions then you wouldn't haven't gotten married.
Ok.
How mad was Felicity that you went along with this?
How do you know she thought it was a bad idea?
I know Felicity.
[Cell phone vibrating]
What's wrong?
I have to go.
Hey.
When you said you haven't changed...
Don't.
Dobroye utro.
How was first night in Russian prison?
Friedkin gave up the dead drop, and now he's dead.
Mission accomplished.
Your being sarcasm, yes?
That man wasn't a threat, Anatoly.
He didn't deserve to die.
In Bratva, there is no death without purpose.
If Friedkin living, he is warning Kovar.
If he is warning Kovar, his information not so good.
Vy ponimayete?
Maybe you could have explained that to me before you sent me in there.
I almost didn't kill him.
But you did.
Why?
Because you told me to.
You trust us.
Now we trust you.
Third test over.
You get it?
You are Bratva now, family.
Last handful of honest cops in this city, and Church nearly took them out along with me.
We're just glad you're all right.
I've got to be thinking this is a PR nightmare, something like this going down and the mayor's MIA.
Look.
He called in this morning.
His health problems are almost over.
That's good news.
Um, we're--we're hearing that one of the, uh, vigilantes who was part of the rescue, that he didn't make it out.
Um, any word on him?
CSU hasn't found a body, so...
So Church has him.
I spent most of my life thinking that men in masks were only capable of doing horrible things.
I may have to reevaluate that.
Let me know when Queen gets in.
Will do.
Are you all right?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I mean, I barely knew the kid, Thea.
But that doesn't make it sting any less.
Well, yeah, sure it does.
The year I've had, this is--this is easy.
Yeah.
I mean, cold as that sounds.
Look.
I know why you're asking, ok, and I'm--I'm fine.
Ok.
I mean, I'm--I'm-- I'm just saying if things ever get less easy, you know I'm here for you, right?
Noted...
And appreciated.
Ok.
What is the point of having keyhole satellite imagery if you can't use it to find anybody?
I feel like I don't understand half the sentences you say.
What I'm saying is is that no matter how hard I try
I cannot find Rene anywhere.
And I was the one who told you guys to leave him behind.
Sounds like another impossible decision.
Does that mean I'm supposed to get better at making them?
I'm saying you were right.
If we're gonna do this, we can't let guilt swallow us up.
I'll keep you from doing it if you promise the same for me.
Deal.
Curtis:
Ow!
Ow!
Ow!
Evelyn:
So "ow" then?
Things have really fallen apart without Oliver, haven't they?
It's a good thing I'm back then.
Was he waiting for an entrance line?
Nope.
He's just that cool.
I got your text.
Have we found Rene?
You get John?
Yeah.
He's fine.
He's holed up at HIVE.
I couldn't write him off, and we are not gonna write off Rene.
We're gonna find him, we're gonna bring him back...
Wherever he is.
Church:
Ah.
Wakey, wakey.
Yow!
Yow!
Heh heh heh.
Hey.
Man, it's been a long time since I've been tagged like this.
Respect.
Oh, my pleasure, but I promise you if you untie me
I'll show you a hell of a lot more than respect.
Ooh, man, you got spirit, and I am duly impressed, but I'm gonna break that spirit.
I'm gonna break your soul, and when we're finished, assuming that you're still alive-- now I wouldn't bet no money on that, though-- there's gonna be very little of you left
for the Green Arrow to work with.
Light him up.
[Screaming]

Greg!
Move your head.
My name is Oliver Queen.
After 5 years in Hell,
I returned home with only one goal-- to save my city.
Today, I fight that war on two fronts.
By day, I lead Star City as its mayor, but by night, I am someone else.
I am something else.
I am the Green Arrow.
Previously on "Arrow"...
Former police Captain Quentin Lance, who will be serving beside me as Deputy Mayor.
Appreciate the vote of confidence, Mr. Mayor.
Are you not from Star City?
No.
Havenrock.
Felicity, voice-over:
There's something that I need you to know.
Havenrock was not the intended target.
Someone redirected the missile to reduce the number of casualties.
That someone was me.
Ever since I killed Andy...
You think you need to be punished.
Stop fighting for me, Lyla.
We need to talk about John.
He's back in the country, and he's in prison, and I need you to break him out.
Come on, Mr. Olympia.
Hustle up.
Mr. Olympia's a bodybuilding competition.
I was--am an Olympic athlete.
Yeah?
They give out gold medals for effort now?
Very funny, and it was a bronze medal.
Why is that so hard to remember?
Quiet.
Every time you're out in the field, you could die.
Don't forget that, don't lose focus.
Overwatch, do we have the target?
Headed toward the east exit, closing fast.
Do we know what he stole?
Not yet, but I have a feeling we're about to find out.
Only if we snag him in the cordon.
Artemis, be ready.
Does this mean I actually get to shoot someone?
I mean, not, you know, shoot someone shoot someone.
I just meant that more than--
We know what you meant.
You wait for him to reach the cordon, then engage.
- Do you copy?
-Copy.
- Copy.
- Copy.
Still a lot of ground to cover.
Rag's should be here.
Overwatch, do you have a 20 on Ragman?
I texted him, like, 10 times and then 10 more, but Nada.
Maybe he's sick.
I mean, the flu's been going around, and by the looks of those rags, he does not hit the drycleaner very often.
Hola, muchacho.
Wild Dog, that is Artemis' shot.
I got him.
What the?
I got him.
What did I say?
That was Artemis' shot!
Dude was getting away.
No, he wasn't.
And you missed.
You were in the Navy.
You should know better.
I was dishonorably discharged actually.
You think that I don't know that?
Deliver that and the evidence to the anti-crime unit and then go home.
What about tonight's training session?
You're taking a few days off.
Nice going...again.
How are we supposed to get this buy to the ACU, call a Uber?

Oliver.
The Op's over, and you've been MIA for days.
It's not acceptable.
Get it together immediately, or you're off the team.
That's why I'm here, to tell you in person.
I'm off the team.
Feels pretty quick to throw in the towel.
I thought you were just getting started.
I was, and then Felicity told me the truth about her role in Havenrock.
You didn't know she told me.
Did she also tell you that she was faced with an impossible choice?
I completely realize that.
I get it wasn't her fault, but that doesn't change the fact that every time I look at her
I see the faces of my family, of everyone I ever loved.
Felicity is a constant reminder of what I lost, and as long as that's true,
I'm sorry.
I can't be here.
What about your father?
I thought he was the reason you were doing this.
I'll have to find another way to honor him.
I'm sorry to lose you.
I'm sorry to go.
Thank you for everything.
Did my comms deceive me, or did you actually let the recruits take an SCPD victory lap?
It's never a victory lap.
They're rough around the edges, but they're making progress except Rory, who was waiting for me upstairs to say that he quit.
He said you spoke with him about Havenrock.
Hey.
How you holding up?
She doesn't know?
About John being in prison?
Oliver told me.
I'm so sorry.
What Lyla means-- we are gonna break him out.
Of military prison?
- Yep.
- Wait, and then what?
John is just a fugitive for the rest of his life?
Better than being punished for something he didn't do.
Lyla, I've been studying the schematics that you hooked me up with.
This would be a lot easier if we had John's cooperation.
U don't have what now?
Apparently, prison is more appealing to John than coming home to his own wife and child.
Ok.
So wait a minute.
Not only do you want to commit multiple felonies and make John a wanted man for the rest of his life, he doesn't actually want you to?
Can I speak with you for a minute?
Yeah.
Is she going to be a problem?
No, but...
I was counting on her being a help.
Maybe I should pull a few of my agents in on this.
No.
If this--if this has your fingerprints on it, then both of John Jr.'s parents will be fugitives.
There is something that might actually make this not impossible.
I just read a briefing memo on a new piece of tech, an antimolecular compound.
I was kind of hoping Felicity could help us get our hands on it.
Lyla, whatever it is, I'll handle it.
Second test over.
Do not make any worse by pulling out suture.
Anatoly, if this is how the Bratva treat their new members,
I'd hate to see how they treat their enemies.
Pass third and final test, find out.
What's the test?
You keep asking about Kovar.
Our sources say this man will get you one step closer.
You have to act fast, though.
He will be arraigned in morning.
Arraigned?
- Jail.
- Yeah, but what makes you think he'll talk to me.
You trust me.
I trust you.
Look.
It's a little early for a drink, don't you think?
It's not for drinking.
Anatoly, what the hell was that for?
I should probably just start prerecording apologies for being late.
Don't worry.
Thea told us.
I'm sorry, man.
Gout is a bitch.
Yes, it is.
I'm actually gonna be taking some time off to have it taken care of.
Well, fortunately, we now have a deputy mayor to help pick up the slack.
It'll be great working with you.
You've had an impressive career, Mr. Lance?
Yeah.
I mean, a lot of people out there probably wouldn't, uh, share that opinion, but thank you.
Public service isn't easy.
Sometimes, you get a little dirty clearing out the filth.
Speaking of which, I heard there was an arrest last night that may help in our case against Tobias Church.
Sergio Espinosa, long-time Los Halcones member turned Church strongman.
The Green Arrow and his merry band of vigilantes left him gift-wrapped for us at anti-crime.
The only thing that was missing was a bow.
Well, you don't sound to happy about that.
Vigilantes are a superficial solution.
If we need their help to get our streets clean--
It means we haven't done our jobs right.
Do you think that you can get Espinosa to flip on Church?
I'll lean on him hard, see if he buckles.
Make sure he doesn't get any help from crooked cops.
Not a chance.
I'm gonna walk every piece of evidence in the custody chain through myself.
Good.
Uh, if it's all right with you,
I'll have Quentin accompany you, be my eyes and ears while I'm out of town.
Sure.
Give us a little bit of time to get acquainted.
Heh.
Great.
I'm sorry.
When did, uh, babysitting evidence become part of the job description?
Since I trust you.
You do?
I mean, all things considered?
If we didn't think you were right for the job, we wouldn't have offered it to you, right?
I haven't had a drink in a week, ok?
Where the hell are you going anyway?
Strange time for a vacation.
You should probably assume that it's not a vacation.
Should I even ask?
No.
I--I'm not gonna be gone long.
Just please make sure that no one destroys the city while I'm away.
Sure.
Ok.
What are you doing?
Reviewing the SCPD evidence log on what we kept from getting stolen from Kord Industries last night.
- 6,800 processor.
- So?
Exactly.
Kord manufactures bleeding-edge tech, military-grade weapons,
I mean, all kinds of city-threatening items.
Why would Church send a guy to steal a computer chip that you could buy from any Tech Village store?
Well, who cares?
Everything's on its way to lockup now.
Because knowing what Church's endgame was is like--it's like this thing that's still out there, lurking.
You all right over there?
Because I've been doing a lot of talking, and you haven't, which is very weird.
Ha!
You know how you told me to tell Rory about Havenrock?
Yeah.
Oh!
He's not sick with the flu, is he?
No.
He's just sick of working with me.
Did you try talking to him?
There's not a lot I can say that would make him feel ok about his entire family being killed.
Incoming.
Another robbery in progress at--
Palmer Tech!
I got to call Oliver.
Or maybe don't, and we'll just let the get robbed.
It will serve Mr. Dennis right for firing us.
He fired me.
You quit.
Because he fired you.
Same thing.
Sanchez, you got anything?
Nada.
What's up?
Hey.
There's been a break-in at Palmer Tech.
Are you still in the area?
Uh...
Yeah.
I can look into that.
How was Palmer Tech?
Before you answer, you should consider that your phone has GPS, and if you were thinking about lying,
I do admire your consistency.
I wasn't thinking of lying to you.
I wasn't looping you in after you made it clear you didn't approve of the decision.
John is the one who doesn't approve of the plan.
John's not thinking clearly.
Well, I bet Roy is, and if he were here,
I think he would tell you that life on the run is no life at all, and I seem to remember you not being on board with that plan.
Roy was making a bad choice just like John is making a bad choice.
He is currently locked up in a military prison for a crime he didn't commit.
To atone for a crime that he did commit, and what does it matter?
John doesn't want to leave.
It is not your choice.
Why do you always have to go and make decisions for him?
He already abandoned the team.
I am not gonna let him abandon his family.
Is that what this is about,
John leaving the team?
This is simple.
I am gonna stop John from making a decision he will come to regret.
You should consider doing the exact same thing with Rory.
You do realize that me having a chat with Rory is completely different than you committing half a dozen felonies, right?
Did you ever think you'd be doing this again, handling evidence?
No.
Didn't think I'd be deputy mayor either, but here we are.
I was surprised you took the job, to be honest.
From what I hear, you and Queen have a, uh-- a complicated history.
Got to be a lot of hatchets to bury there.
Yeah.
Well, at least I know where they're buried.
That's something you can't buy or steal.
Package is here, boss.
D.A., Deputy Mayor, too.
Ah.
Bonus.
Get ready to move.
Let me guess.
Felicity filled you in.
That you're gonna break into a military prison?
Yeah, and you got the nerve to call me Wild Dog?
I'm done debating this.
Really?
Because this is the first we've heard of it.
I thought we were your team.
Running off to bust someone out of prison sounds like team business, and what happens to us when you get caught?
You've made it clear that we can't do this vigilante thing without you.
When I get caught?
I'm not gonna get caught.
Right because we're not gonna let you do this.
I'm sorry.
Did you say that you're not gonna let me?
Yes.
I need to see you physically deposit the item.
I've been on this job 15 years.
I've never lost a piece of evidence.
Now relax, Sergeant.
No one's doubting your proficiency here, ok?
Seems like.
This is it.
You gonna let me do my job now?
Have at it.
- What the hell?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Get out of here!
Whoo!
Find the weapons, boys.
Ahh.
Sorry, gents.
Load them up!
And burn this puppy down.
Let's go, let's go!
Ok.
Last chance.
Get off the street.
I didn't think he'd actually hit you guys.
You know what really sucks?
Realizing that in all those training sessions where he was kicking our respective asses the whole time he was taking it easy on us.
Yeah.
Remind me to never, ever get on his bad side.
I think that would imply that he has a good side, and, you know, Felicity, could you please explain to me again how you thought this was all gonna go down?
Well, I thought if he saw you guys all united against his crazy plan he'd reconsider.
Right because Oliver Queen is known for thinking things through and taking input from others.
Right.
Wow.
The ever-expanding club house.
And who are you?
I'm Thea, Oliver's Chief of Staff.
And also his sister.
Don't tell me Oliver beat you up, too?
Heh.
Ollie did this?
Object lesson, long story.
It's fine.
Don't ask.
What happened to you?
Tobias Church happened.
That evidence that you guys recovered from Kord Industries-- modified to go boom.
He wanted it to be put into lockup.
And he wanted to raid it.
One-stop shopping for weapons.
Including those RPGs that he took from Amertek if this report's right.
We got to find out what he's planning to do with those weapons-- because it ain't nothing good.
This is a really bad time for Oliver to be out of town.
Yeah.
I just tried him.
He's gone dark.
Why don't you guys hit the streets?
We want to figure out what Church is up to before it's too late.
- You sure?
- Mm-hmm.
I don't think Oliver would want us out there without him.
Right.
Well, Oliver forfeited his opinion when he left.
Ok, but this is an all hands on deck situation, rag-covered hands included.
Just saying.
Where's Private Jesseman?
This is usually his delivery.
Flu's been tearing through the base, sir.
I drew the short straw.
I don't see you on the list.
Your C.O. should have submitted a change of personnel form.
You sure he didn't?
It's an hour's drive back to the base.
Can't you refresh your Wi-Fi or something?
There you are.
As you were, Private.
Thank you, sir.
I'm in.
25 minutes till extraction.
Roger that.
Facilities cameras are on a closed network.
If you can give me access to the mainframe, I can open it up.
- I'm on my way.
- Oliver...
If you don't make it to the extraction point--
I'll make it, and I won't be alone.
Ahem.
Ohh.
Ahh.
Hey.
You speak English?
Yes.
Your accent-- you are American.
Yeah, maybe once upon a time, but, uh, now I'm more just enjoying everything that Russia has to offer.
Yes.
I can smell that.
You judge me?
You're in this cell, too.
Yes.
A mistake my boss will correct very soon.
You mean Konstantin Kovar?
How do you know that name?
Oh, same way that I know your name's Pyotr Friedkin, same way I know that you launder money for Kovar, same way that I know that's what you're doing here.
How can you know that unless...
Are you Bratva?
He's fine.
Mmm.
I am Bratva, and you are gonna tell me everything that I want to know.
Your turn to run system check.
I'm gonna hit the head.
Don't touch my ball.
Dude, what the hell?
Transponder's in place.
Roger that.
I've got eyes now.
I'll walk you to Johnny's cell.
Hey!
Hey.
Is this--uh, is this a bad time?
Do I want to even ask how you found me?
Heh.
I feel like that's a trick question.
Sorry about the mess.
Wow!
These are amazing.
You spend enough time with other people's castoffs, you find ways to make something useful out of them.
My father always used to say that.
He owned a pawn shop.
On Southmoor Road, right?
How'd you know?
Last week, you told Oliver that you had joined the team to honor your father.
When you quit...
I wanted to find out more about what you were giving up.
Your father was a Gulf War veteran, 2nd Battalion, 1st Marines, but that's not what made him a hero, was it?
No.
He wore your rags, his father before him, whose name was also Rory.
That's a big legacy to live up to.
Mine is going to be what happened to Havenrock.
I'm gonna have to live with that every day for the rest of my life, knowing that I cannot fix it and knowing that it's not the last mistake that I'm ever going to have to make.
I still don't know if I can--
Work side by side with someone who's a reminder of what you lost.
I understand.
Just like you're a reminder of what I did, and I--I know they're not the same thing.
We both want the same thing, to be able to live with what's happened so that we can move forward.
It's Curtis.
I am so sorry, and we could really use you.
I--I wish I could, Felicity.
I just...
I can't right now.
I'm sorry.
If you change your mind, well, we're here.
Cell 1138, right side, third from the left.
He's not here.
Give me a minute while I scan the feeds.
Oh, no.
What?
They moved him into gen pop.
You go in there, neither of you are getting out.
Talk to me.
When's he coming back to his cell?
Outside our window.
If those MPs wake up, the first thing they're gonna do is move John and all the other prisoners to a more secure location, and we lose our shot.
Abort.
We're blown.
Tell me where I can find Kovar.
You think you scare me more than him?
No, but he's not locked up in here with you.
I am.
You wouldn't kill me in front of all of them.
I'm not gonna lay a finger on you.
Same can't be said for Alisa.
Or maybe I'll visit your wife Maya when she's picking up Alisa from ballet.
Somebody is gonna die.
It can be Kovar, it can be your wife, it can be your child, but I need you to choose and do it quickly.
Kovar is very paranoid, careful.
We never meet in person, only remotely.
Remotely?
How?
A digital dead drop, the Dark Web.
What's the IP address?
What is the IP address?
108.166.7.161.
If this information is incorrect, your family will suffer.
How does an American become this...
This...
Bratva devil?
I don't know.
About time, Blondie.
Can we go now?
First of all, not my name.
Second, were you able to locate Church on your recon?
No, but street cams actually picked him up, so we know he's on the move.
We just don't know where he's moving to.
We can't go after Church without knowing his endgame first.
Sounds like an excuse to sit around and do nothing.
What are you doing?
Not nothing.
You're cross-plotting
Church's prior locations into a projection algorithm.
Hmm.
You probably got beat up in grade school a lot.
And junior high.
Ok.
Based on Church's route, I'm calculating an 86% likelihood he's going to 18 Mill Road.
Why does that sound so familiar?
Because we were just there to hand over Sergio.
That's where the ACU's bunkered.
Church is gonna take them out.
Montes, quit screwing around.
Station chief, this is Gans from cell block "C."
We have a code yellow situation.
Initiate immediate lockdown and have all prisoners return to their cells.
I'm not rolling on Church.
You think you scare me more than him?
Hmm.
No...
But he's not here with you.
I am.
Hmm.
You're not gonna put a beating on me.
You're a D.A.
Yeah.
Haven't you heard?
All of the justice in this city comes from vigilantes.
Word on the street is is that Church's planning something, something big.
You tell me what it is, and he'll be the one in those cuffs instead of you.
Heh heh heh.
You're talking about the trust.
Oh, you can't stop it, man.
Can't even come close.
What's going on?
Church.
At least we definitely know where Church is now.
D'Angelo's right.
We got to put him down.
Against that?
Without Oliver?
No.
We're sh-- shorthanded as it is.
You scared?
No, but I'm not stupid either.
Evie's right.
I'm not sending you guys out there just to get slaughtered.
Thanks for the vote of confidence.
You saw what you're up against, ok?
This isn't some drill where you take down a petty thug or drug dealer.
This is real, ok, with real stakes.
The 3 of you could die out there.
That's something we get to decide for ourselves, isn't it?
I mean, I don't know about everyone else, but I didn't join this team to stay safe.
Ok.
Why don't we take a vote?
All those in favor.
We're all gonna say yes, Blondie.
God.
That's not my name.
Good.
Ok.
Go.
Do not die.
Code yellow.
Return all prisoners to their cells.
Code yellow.
Return all prisoners to their cells.
Immediate code yellow enforced.
Move prisoners to their cells.
Hey, John.
What's new?
I'm not doing this.
I told Lyla.
Yeah.
You can yell at us later, but right now, we're on a bit of a clock.
Are you even hearing me right now?
I don't want anything to do with this.
The MPs are gonna do a count in a few minutes.
My guess is they're only expecting to find one person in here.
Really?
So that's your play, blackmail?
Do what you say, or you get caught in here, too?
You're my brother, John.
What happens to you happens to me.
Oliver...
I killed my brother.
I went to the army to change, and I haven't changed.
I know, all right, and I know that you think this is your penance for that.
Oliver, it's not just that.
I trusted Andy.
Even when you told me not to, I trusted him, and now Laurel's dead.
I need you, the team needs you, the city needs you.
I'm not saying you shouldn't do your penance.
You probably should, but do it as Spartan.
What's in the box?
It's an antimolecular compound, and theoretically, it should eat through anything.
Not gonna ask you how you got your hands on this.
Hey.
You came back for me, even against my wishes.
I guess I haven't changed that much either.
Maybe that's what I have to do my penance for.
That toy of yours is definitely coming in handy.
Project that Lyla's been keeping an eye on for Argus.
Should have known she'd be helping out.
Tell Johnny he can thank me later.
You've got to keep moving.
Follow the sublevel north 200 meters, then climb up.
What--what is it?
Comm's being jammed.
No, no, no.
Hey.
Is there another way out of here?
Mind uncuffing me before they kill you?
Hi.
Hey.
Hey.
If that's for taking out the wall, the blast will kill us before we can get out.
We're in too tight.
- Trust me.
- Yeah, says the creepy-looking--
What the hell are you anyways?
I'm in place.
Blow it.
Sorry we blew up your building.
Come on!
We're going up.
Then what?
Which way, Overwatch?
Take a right at the end of that hallway.
It should be a fire exit.
If you go through there, you're home free easy.
Not so easy.
Rags, cover me.
Go!
Go, go!
Unh!
Get him up.
Come on.
I probably should just shoot you, but...
But you've earned a little suffering.
Get him to safety.
- But--
- Go!
It's ok.
Hey.
Don't kill him.
He may have his uses.
We've got to go back for Wild Dog.
Copy.
Overwatch, Mr. Terrific is hurt.
We could use some help.
Inbound.
Hold on.
Get in!
Where's the Wild Dog kid?
Still inside, fighting Church.
We've got to go back for him.
No.
Unless you all want to die, we've got to go now, now!
We can't just leave him.
You have to.
Go.
Come on!
Let's go.
- Here.
- What's this?
Just put it on.
Let's go.
Dig, your harness.
You two, freeze!
Down on the ground!
Lace your fingers behind your head!
Do it now, or we will shoot!
John, don't move.
This place should keep you off the grid for the time being.
Until we find a permanent solution.
Hey.
First things first.
Can't believe you broke me out of prison.
For better or worse, Johnny.
Told you I wanted to stay.
And I figured if you wanted to make your own decisions then you wouldn't haven't gotten married.
Ok.
How mad was Felicity that you went along with this?
How do you know she thought it was a bad idea?
I know Felicity.
What's wrong?
I have to go.
Hey.
When you said you haven't changed...
Don't.
Dobroye utro.
How was first night in Russian prison?
Friedkin gave up the dead drop, and now he's dead.
Mission accomplished.
Your being sarcasm, yes?
That man wasn't a threat, Anatoly.
He didn't deserve to die.
In Bratva, there is no death without purpose.
If Friedkin living, he is warning Kovar.
If he is warning Kovar, his information not so good.
Vy ponimayete?
Maybe you could have explained that to me before you sent me in there.
I almost didn't kill him.
But you did.
Why?
Because you told me to.
You trust us.
Now we trust you.
Third test over.
You get it?
You are Bratva now, family.
Last handful of honest cops in this city, and Church nearly took them out along with me.
We're just glad you're all right.
I've got to be thinking this is a PR nightmare, something like this going down and the mayor's MIA.
Look.
He called in this morning.
His health problems are almost over.
That's good news.
Um, we're--we're hearing that one of the, uh, vigilantes who was part of the rescue, that he didn't make it out.
Um, any word on him?
CSU hasn't found a body, so...
So Church has him.
I spent most of my life thinking that men in masks were only capable of doing horrible things.
I may have to reevaluate that.
Let me know when Queen gets in.
Will do.
Are you all right?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I mean, I barely knew the kid, Thea.
But that doesn't make it sting any less.
Well, yeah, sure it does.
The year I've had, this is--this is easy.
Yeah.
I mean, cold as that sounds.
Look.
I know why you're asking, ok, and I'm--I'm fine.
Ok.
I mean, I'm--I'm-- I'm just saying if things ever get less easy, you know I'm here for you, right?
Noted...
And appreciated.
Ok.
What is the point of having keyhole satellite imagery if you can't use it to find anybody?
I feel like I don't understand half the sentences you say.
What I'm saying is is that no matter how hard I try
I cannot find Rene anywhere.
And I was the one who told you guys to leave him behind.
Sounds like another impossible decision.
Does that mean I'm supposed to get better at making them?
I'm saying you were right.
If we're gonna do this, we can't let guilt swallow us up.
I'll keep you from doing it if you promise the same for me.
Deal.
Ow!
Ow!
Ow!
So "ow" then?
Things have really fallen apart without Oliver, haven't they?
It's a good thing I'm back then.
Was he waiting for an entrance line?
Nope.
He's just that cool.
I got your text.
Have we found Rene?
You get John?
Yeah.
He's fine.
He's holed up at HIVE.
I couldn't write him off, and we are not gonna write off Rene.
We're gonna find him, we're gonna bring him back...
Wherever he is.
Ah.
Wakey, wakey.
Yow!
Yow!
Heh heh heh.
Hey.
Man, it's been a long time since I've been tagged like this.
Respect.
Oh, my pleasure, but I promise you if you untie me
I'll show you a hell of a lot more than respect.
Ooh, man, you got spirit, and I am duly impressed, but I'm gonna break that spirit.
I'm gonna break your soul, and when we're finished, assuming that you're still alive-- now I wouldn't bet no money on that, though-- there's gonna be very little of you left
for the Green Arrow to work with.
Light him up.
== sync, corrected by elderman == @elder_man
Greg!
Move your head.
Oliver:
My name is Oliver Queen.
After 5 years in Hell,
I returned home with only one goal...
To save my city.
Today, I fight that war on two fronts.
By day, I lead Star City as its mayor, but by night, I am someone else.
I am something else.
I am the Green Arrow.
Previously on "Arrow"...
Former police Captain Quentin Lance, who will be serving beside me as Deputy Mayor.
Appreciate the vote of confidence, Mr. Mayor.
Are you not from Star City?
No.
Havenrock.
Felicity, voice-over:
There's something that I need you to know.
Havenrock was not the intended target.
Someone redirected the missile to reduce the number of casualties.
That someone was me.
Ever since I killed Andy...
You think you need to be punished.
Stop fighting for me, Lyla.
Lyla:
We need to talk about John.
He's back in the country, and he's in prison, and I need you to break him out.
Rene:
Come on, Mr. Olympia.
Hustle up.
Mr. Olympia's a bodybuilding competition.
I was... am an Olympic athlete.
Yeah?
They give out gold medals for effort now?
Curtis:
Very funny, and it was a bronze medal.
Why is that so hard to remember?
Oliver:
Quiet.
Every time you're out in the field, you could die.
Don't forget that, don't lose focus.
Overwatch, do we have the target?
Headed toward the east exit, closing fast.
Do we know what he stole?
Not yet, but I have a feeling we're about to find out.
Only if we snag him in the cordon.
Artemis, be ready.
Does this mean I actually get to shoot someone?
I mean, not, you know, shoot someone shoot someone.
I just meant that more than...
Oliver:
We know what you meant.
You wait for him to reach the cordon, then engage.
Do you copy?
Copy.
Curtis:
Copy.
Rene:
Copy.
Still a lot of ground to cover.
Rag's should be here.
Oliver:
Overwatch, do you have a 20 on Ragman?
I texted him, like, 10 times and then 10 more, but Nada.
Maybe he's sick.
I mean, the flu's been going around, and by the looks of those rags, he does not hit the drycleaner very often.
[Door opens]
[Door closes] Hola, muchacho.
Wild Dog, that is Artemis' shot.
I got him.
[Gunshots]
What the?
I got him.
[Gunshots continue]
What did I say?
That was Artemis' shot!
Dude was getting away.
No, he wasn't.
And you missed.
You were in the Navy.
You should know better.
I was dishonorably discharged actually.
You think that I don't know that?
Deliver that and the evidence to the anti-crime unit and then go home.
What about tonight's training session?
You're taking a few days off.
Evelyn:
Nice going... again.
How are we supposed to get this buy to the ACU, call a Uber?
* ARROW * Season 05 Episode 04 "Penance" Precisely Synchronized by srjanapala
[Door opens, closes]
Oliver.
The Op's over, and you've been MIA for days.
It's not acceptable.
Get it together immediately, or you're off the team.
That's why I'm here, to tell you in person.
I'm off the team.
Feels pretty quick to throw in the towel.
I thought you were just getting started.
I was, and then Felicity told me the truth about her role in Havenrock.
You didn't know she told me.
Did she also tell you that she was faced with an impossible choice?
I completely realize that.
I get it wasn't her fault, but that doesn't change the fact that every time I look at her
I see the faces of my family, of everyone I ever loved.
Felicity is a constant reminder of what I lost, and as long as that's true,
I'm sorry.
I can't be here.
What about your father?
I thought he was the reason you were doing this.
I'll have to find another way to honor him.
I'm sorry to lose you.
I'm sorry to go.
Thank you for everything.
Felicity:
Did my comms deceive me, or did you actually let the recruits take an SCPD victory lap?
It's never a victory lap.
They're... rough around the edges, but they're making progress... except Rory, who was waiting for me upstairs to say that he quit.
He said you spoke with him about Havenrock.
Hey.
How you holding up?
She doesn't know?
About John being in prison?
Oliver told me.
I'm so sorry.
What Lyla means...
We are gonna break him out.
Of military prison?
- Yep.
- Wait, and then what?
John is just a fugitive for the rest of his life?
Better than being punished for something he didn't do.
Lyla, I've been studying the schematics that you hooked me up with.
This would be a lot easier if we had John's cooperation.
U don't have what now?
Apparently, prison is more appealing to John than coming home to his own wife and child.
Ok.
So wait a minute.
Not only do you want to commit multiple felonies and make John a wanted man for the rest of his life, he doesn't actually want you to?
Can I speak with you for a minute?
Yeah.
Is she going to be a problem?
No, but...
I was counting on her being a help.
Maybe I should pull a few of my agents in on this.
No.
If this... if this has your fingerprints on it, then both of John Jr.'s parents will be fugitives.
There is something that might actually make this not impossible.
I just read a briefing memo on a new piece of tech, an antimolecular compound.
I was kind of hoping Felicity could help us get our hands on it.
Lyla, whatever it is, I'll handle it.
Anatoly:
Second test over.
Do not make any worse by pulling out suture.
Anatoly, if this is how the Bratva treat their new members,
I'd hate to see how they treat their enemies.
Pass third and final test, find out.
What's the test?
You keep asking about Kovar.
Our sources say this man will get you one step closer.
You have to act fast, though.
He will be arraigned in morning.
Arraigned?
- Jail.
- Yeah, but... what makes you think he'll talk to me.
You trust me.
I trust you.
Look.
It's a little early for a drink, don't you think?
It's not for drinking.
Anatoly, what the hell was that for?
I should probably just start prerecording apologies for being late.
Don't worry.
Thea told us.
I'm sorry, man.
Gout is a bitch.
Yes, it is.
I'm actually gonna be taking some time off to have it taken care of.
Well, fortunately, we now have a deputy mayor to help pick up the slack.
It'll be great working with you.
You've had an impressive career, Mr. Lance?
Yeah.
I mean, a lot of people out there probably wouldn't, uh, share that opinion, but thank you.
Public service isn't easy.
Sometimes, you get a little dirty clearing out the filth.
Speaking of which, I heard there was an arrest last night that may help in our case against Tobias Church.
Sergio Espinosa, long-time Los Halcones member turned Church strongman.
The Green Arrow and his merry band of vigilantes left him gift-wrapped for us at anti-crime.
The only thing that was missing was a bow.
Well, you don't sound to happy about that.
Vigilantes are a superficial solution.
If we need their help to get our streets clean...
It means we haven't done our jobs right.
Do you think that you can get Espinosa to flip on Church?
I'll lean on him hard, see if he buckles.
Make sure he doesn't get any help from crooked cops.
Not a chance.
I'm gonna walk every piece of evidence in the custody chain through myself.
Good.
Uh, if it's all right with you,
I'll have Quentin accompany you, be my... eyes and ears while I'm out of town.
Sure.
Give us a little bit of time to get acquainted.
Heh.
Great.
I'm sorry.
When did, uh, babysitting evidence become part of the job description?
Since I trust you.
You do?
I mean, all things considered?
If we didn't think you were right for the job, we wouldn't have offered it to you, right?
I haven't had a drink in a week, ok?
Where the hell are you going anyway?
Strange time for a vacation.
You should probably assume that it's not a vacation.
Should I even ask?
No.
I...
I'm not gonna be gone long.
Just please make sure that no one destroys the city while I'm away.
Sure.
Ok.
Felicity:
What are you doing?
Reviewing the SCPD evidence log on what we kept from getting stolen from Kord Industries last night.
- 6,800 processor.
- So?
Exactly.
Kord manufactures bleeding-edge tech, military-grade weapons,
I mean, all kinds of city-threatening items.
Why would Church send a guy to steal a computer chip that you could buy from any Tech Village store?
Well, who cares?
Everything's on its way to lockup now.
Because knowing what Church's endgame was is like... it's like this thing that's still out there, lurking.
You all right over there?
Because I've been doing a lot of talking, and you haven't, which is very weird.
Ha!
You know how you told me to tell Rory about Havenrock?
Yeah.
Oh!
He's not sick with the flu, is he?
No.
He's just sick of working with me.
Did you try talking to him?
There's not a lot I can say that would make him feel ok about his entire family being killed.
[Computer beeps]
Incoming.
Another robbery in progress at...
Palmer Tech!
I got to call Oliver.
Or maybe don't, and we'll just let the get robbed.
It will serve Mr. Dennis right for firing us.
He fired me.
You quit.
Because he fired you.
Same thing.
[Alarm blaring]
Man on radio:
Sanchez, you got anything?
Nada.
[Cell phone rings]
What's up?
Hey.
There's been a break-in at Palmer Tech.
Are you still in the area?
Uh...
Yeah.
I can look into that.
How was Palmer Tech?
Before you answer, you should consider that your phone has GPS, and if you were thinking about lying,
I do admire your consistency.
I wasn't thinking of lying to you.
I wasn't looping you in after you made it clear you didn't approve of the decision.
John is the one who doesn't approve of the plan.
John's not thinking clearly.
Well, I bet Roy is, and if he were here,
I think he would tell you that life on the run is no life at all, and I seem to remember you not being on board with that plan.
Roy was making a bad choice just like John is making a bad choice.
He is currently locked up in a military prison for a crime he didn't commit.
To atone for a crime that he did commit, and what does it matter?
John doesn't want to leave.
It is not your choice.
Why do you always have to go and make decisions for him?
He already abandoned the team.
I am not gonna let him abandon his family.
Is that what this is about,
John leaving the team?
This is simple.
I am gonna stop John from making a decision he will come to regret.
You should consider doing the exact same thing with Rory.
You do realize that me having a chat with Rory is completely different than you committing half a dozen felonies, right?
Did you ever think you'd be doing this again, handling evidence?
No.
Didn't think I'd be deputy mayor either, but here we are.
I was surprised you took the job, to be honest.
From what I hear, you and Queen have a, uh...
A complicated history.
Got to be a lot of hatchets to bury there.
Yeah.
Well, at least I know where they're buried.
That's something you can't buy or steal.
Package is here, boss.
D.A., Deputy Mayor, too.
Ah.
Bonus.
Get ready to move.
[Tyres squeal]
Let me guess.
Felicity filled you in.
That you're gonna break into a military prison?
Yeah, and you got the nerve to call me Wild Dog?
I'm done debating this.
Evelyn:
Really?
Because this is the first we've heard of it.
I thought we were your team.
Running off to bust someone out of prison sounds like team business, and what happens to us when you get caught?
You've made it clear that we can't do this vigilante thing without you.
When I get caught?
I'm not gonna get caught.
Curtis:
Right because we're not gonna let you do this.
I'm sorry.
Did you say that you're not gonna let me?
Yes.
I need to see you physically deposit the item.
I've been on this job 15 years.
I've never lost a piece of evidence.
Now relax, Sergeant.
No one's doubting your proficiency here, ok?
Seems like.
[Whistling]
This is it.
You gonna let me do my job now?
Have at it.
[Case humming]
- What the hell?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Get out of here!
[Alarm blaring]
Church:
Whoo!
Find the weapons, boys.
Ahh.
Sorry, gents.
Load them up!
And burn this puppy down.
Church:
Let's go, let's go!
Ok.
Last chance.
Get off the street.
I didn't think he'd actually hit you guys.
Rene:
You know what really sucks?
Curtis:
Realizing that in all those training sessions where he was kicking our respective asses the whole time he was taking it easy on us.
Evelyn:
Yeah.
Remind me to never, ever get on his bad side.
Curtis:
I think that would imply that he has a good side, and, you know, Felicity, could you please explain to me again how you thought this was all gonna go down?
Well, I thought if he saw you guys all united against his crazy plan he'd reconsider.
Right because Oliver Queen is known for thinking things through and taking input from others.
Right.
Wow.
The ever-expanding club house.
And who are you?
I'm Thea, Oliver's Chief of Staff.
And also his sister.
Don't tell me Oliver beat you up, too?
Heh.
Ollie did this?
Object lesson, long story.
It's fine.
Don't ask.
What happened to you?
Tobias Church happened.
That evidence that you guys recovered from Kord Industries...
Modified to go boom.
He wanted it to be put into lockup.
And he wanted to raid it.
One-stop shopping for weapons.
Including those RPGs that he took from Amertek if this report's right.
We got to find out what he's planning to do with those weapons...
Because it ain't nothing good.
This is a really bad time for Oliver to be out of town.
Yeah.
I just tried him.
He's gone dark.
Why don't you guys hit the streets?
We want to figure out what Church is up to before it's too late.
- You sure?
- Mm-hmm.
I don't think Oliver would want us out there without him.
Right.
Well, Oliver forfeited his opinion when he left.
Ok, but this is an all hands on deck situation, rag-covered hands included.
Just saying.
Where's Private Jesseman?
This is usually his delivery.
Flu's been tearing through the base, sir.
I drew the short straw.
I don't see you on the list.
Your C.O. should have submitted a change of personnel form.
You sure he didn't?
It's an hour's drive back to the base.
Can't you refresh your Wi-Fi or something?
There you are.
As you were, Private.
Thank you, sir.
[Beep]
I'm in.
25 minutes till extraction.
Roger that.
Facilities cameras are on a closed network.
If you can give me access to the mainframe, I can open it up.
- I'm on my way.
- Oliver...
If you don't make it to the extraction point...
I'll make it, and I won't be alone.
Ahem.
Ohh.
Ahh.
Hey.
You speak English?
Yes.
Your accent...
You are American.
Yeah, maybe once upon a time, but, uh, now I'm more just enjoying everything that Russia has to offer.
Yes.
I can smell that.
You judge me?
You're in this cell, too.
Yes.
A mistake my boss will correct very soon.
You mean Konstantin Kovar?
How do you know that name?
Oh, same way that I know your name's Pyotr Friedkin, same way I know that you launder money for Kovar, same way that I know that's what you're doing here.
How can you know that unless...
Are you Bratva?
[Gags]
[Coughing]
He's fine.
Mmm.
I am Bratva, and you are gonna tell me everything that I want to know.
Your turn to run system check.
I'm gonna hit the head.
Don't touch my ball.
[Beep]
[Beep]
Dude, what the hell?
Transponder's in place.
Roger that.
I've got eyes now.
I'll walk you to Johnny's cell.
Hey!
Hey.
Is this... uh, is this a bad time?
Do I want to even ask how you found me?
Heh.
I feel like that's a trick question.
Sorry about the mess.
Wow!
These are amazing.
You spend enough time with other people's castoffs, you find ways to make something useful out of them.
My father always used to say that.
He owned a pawn shop.
On Southmoor Road, right?
How'd you know?
Last week, you told Oliver that you had joined the team to honor your father.
When you quit...
I wanted to find out more about what you were giving up.
Your father was a Gulf War veteran, 2nd Battalion, 1st Marines, but that's not what made him a hero, was it?
No.
He wore your rags, like his father before him, whose name was also Rory.
That's a big legacy to live up to.
Mine is going to be what happened to Havenrock.
I'm gonna have to live with that every day for the rest of my life, knowing that I cannot fix it and knowing that it's not the last mistake that I'm ever going to have to make.
I still don't know if I can...
Work side by side with someone who's a reminder of what you lost.
I understand.
Just like you're a reminder of what I did, and I...
I know they're not the same thing.
We both want the same thing, to be able to live with what's happened so that we can move... forward.
[Cell phone vibrating]
It's Curtis.
I am so sorry, and we could really use you.
I...
I wish I could, Felicity.
I just...
I can't right now.
I'm sorry.
If you change your mind, well, we're here.
Lyla:
Cell 1138, right side, third from the left.
He's not here.
Give me a minute while I scan the feeds.
Oh, no.
What?
They moved him into gen pop.
You go in there, neither of you are getting out.
Talk to me.
When's he coming back to his cell?
Outside our window.
If those MPs wake up, the first thing they're gonna do is move John and all the other prisoners to a more secure location, and we lose our shot.
Abort.
We're blown.
Tell me where I can find Kovar.
You think you scare me more than him?
No, but he's not locked up in here with you.
I am.
You wouldn't kill me in front of all of them.
I'm not gonna lay a finger on you.
Same can't be said for Alisa.
Or maybe I'll visit your wife Maya when she's picking up Alisa from ballet.
Somebody... is gonna die.
It can be Kovar, it can be your wife, it can be your child, but I need you to choose and do it quickly.
Kovar is very paranoid, careful.
We never meet in person, only remotely.
Remotely?
How?
A digital dead drop, the Dark Web.
What's the IP address?
What is the IP address?
108.166.7.161.
If this information is incorrect, your family will suffer.
How does an American become this...
This...
Bratva devil?
I don't know.
[Bones crack]
About time, Blondie.
Can we go now?
First of all, not my name.
Second, were you able to locate Church on your recon?
No, but street cams actually picked him up, so we know he's on the move.
We just don't know where he's moving to.
We can't go after Church without knowing his endgame first.
Sounds like an excuse to sit around and do nothing.
What are you doing?
Not nothing.
Curtis:
You're cross-plotting.
Church's prior locations into a projection algorithm.
Hmm.
You probably got beat up in grade school a lot.
And junior high.
Ok.
Based on Church's route, I'm calculating an 86% likelihood he's going to 18 Mill Road.
Why does that sound so familiar?
Because we were just there to hand over Sergio.
That's where the ACU's bunkered.
Church is gonna take them out.
Montes, quit screwing around.
Station chief, this is Gans from cell block "C."
We have a code yellow situation.
Initiate immediate lockdown and have all prisoners return to their cells.
I'm not rolling on Church.
You think you scare me more than him?
Hmm.
No...
But he's not here with you.
I am.
Hmm.
You're not gonna put a beating on me.
You're a D.A.
Yeah.
Haven't you heard?
All of the justice in this city comes from vigilantes.
Word on the street is is that Church's planning something, something big.
You tell me what it is, and he'll be the one in those cuffs instead of you.
Heh heh heh.
You're talking about the trust.
Oh, you can't stop it, man.
Can't even... come close.
What's going on?
[Machineguns firing]
Church.
At least we definitely know where Church is now.
D'Angelo's right.
We got to put him down.
Evelyn:
Against that?
Without Oliver?
No.
We're sh...
Shorthanded as it is.
You scared?
No, but I'm not stupid either.
Evie's right.
I'm not sending you guys out there just to get slaughtered.
Thanks for the vote of confidence.
You saw what you're up against, ok?
This isn't some drill where you take down a petty thug or drug dealer.
This is real, ok, with real stakes.
The 3 of you could die out there.
Rory:
That's something we get to decide for ourselves, isn't it?
I mean, I don't know about everyone else, but I didn't join this team to stay safe.
Ok.
Why don't we take a vote?
All those in favor.
Rene:
We're all gonna say yes, Blondie.
God.
That's not my name.
Good.
Ok.
Go.
Do not die.
Man on P.A.:
Code yellow.
Return all prisoners to their cells.
Code yellow.
Return all prisoners to their cells.
Immediate code yellow enforced.
Move prisoners to their cells.
[Alarm blaring]
Hey, John.
What's new?
I'm not doing this.
I told Lyla.
Yeah.
You can yell at us later, but right now, we're on a bit of a clock.
Are you even hearing me right now?
I don't want anything to do with this.
The MPs are gonna do a count in a few minutes.
My guess is they're only expecting to find one person in here.
Really?
So that's your play, blackmail?
Do what you say, or you get caught in here, too?
You're my brother, John.
What happens to you happens to me.
Oliver...
I killed my brother.
I went to the army to change, and I haven't changed.
I know, all right, and I know that you think this is your penance for that.
Oliver, it's not just that.
I trusted Andy.
Even when you told me not to, I trusted him, and now Laurel's dead.
I need you, the team needs you, the city needs you.
I'm not saying you shouldn't do your penance.
You probably should, but do it as Spartan.
What's in the box?
It's an antimolecular compound, and theoretically, it should eat through anything.
Not gonna ask you how you got your hands on this.
Hey.
You came back for me, even against my wishes.
I guess I haven't changed that much either.
Maybe that's what I have to do my penance for.
That toy of yours is definitely coming in handy.
Project that Lyla's been keeping an eye on for Argus.
Should have known she'd be helping out.
Tell Johnny he can thank me later.
You've got to keep moving.
Follow the sublevel north 200 meters, then climb up.
[Static]
What... what is it?
Comm's being jammed.
[Alarm blaring]
Adrian:
No, no, no.
Hey.
Is there another way out of here?
Mind uncuffing me before they kill you?
Rory:
Hi.
Adrian:
Hey.
Hey.
If that's for taking out the wall, the blast will kill us before we can get out.
We're in too tight.
- Trust me.
- Yeah, says the creepy-looking...
What the hell are you anyways?
I'm in place.
Blow it.
Sorry we blew up your building.
Come on!
We're going up.
Then what?
[Gunshots]
Which way, Overwatch?
Take a right at the end of that hallway.
It should be a fire exit.
If you go through there, you're home free easy.
Not so easy.
Rags, cover me.
Go!
Go, go!
Unh!
Okay.
Get him up.
Come on.
[Groans]
I probably should just shoot you, but...
But you've earned a little suffering.
Get him to safety.
- But...
- Go!
It's ok.
Hey.
Don't kill him.
He may have his uses.
We've got to go back for Wild Dog.
Copy.
Overwatch, Mr. Terrific is hurt.
We could use some help.
Inbound.
Hold on.
Get in!
Where's the Wild Dog kid?
Still inside, fighting Church.
We've got to go back for him.
No.
Unless you all want to die, we've got to go now, now!
We can't just leave him.
You have to.
Go.
Come on!
Let's go.
- Here.
- What's this?
Just put it on.
Let's go.
Dig, your harness.
You two, freeze!
Down on the ground!
Lace your fingers behind your head!
Do it now, or we will shoot!
John, don't move.
This place should keep you off the grid for the time being.
Until we find a permanent solution.
Hey.
First things first.
Can't believe you broke me out of prison.
For better or worse, Johnny.
Told you I wanted to stay.
And I figured if you wanted to make your own decisions then you wouldn't haven't gotten married.
Ok.
How mad was Felicity that you went along with this?
How do you know she thought it was a bad idea?
I know Felicity.
[Cell phone vibrating]
What's wrong?
I have to go.
Hey.
When you said you haven't changed...
Don't.
Dobroye utro.
How was first night in Russian prison?
Friedkin gave up the dead drop, and now he's dead.
Mission accomplished.
Your being sarcasm, yes?
That man wasn't a threat, Anatoly.
He didn't deserve to die.
In Bratva, there is no death without purpose.
If Friedkin living, he is warning Kovar.
If he is warning Kovar, his information not so good.
Vy ponimayete?
Maybe you could have explained that to me before you sent me in there.
I almost didn't kill him.
But you did.
Why?
Because you told me to.
You trust us.
Now we trust you.
Third test over.
You get it?
You are Bratva now, family.
Last handful of honest cops in this city, and Church nearly took them out along with me.
We're just glad you're all right.
I've got to be thinking this is a PR nightmare, something like this going down and the mayor's MIA.
Look.
He called in this morning.
His health problems are almost over.
That's good news.
Um, we're... we're hearing that one of the, uh, vigilantes who was part of the rescue, that he didn't make it out.
Um, any word on him?
CSU hasn't found a body, so...
So Church has him.
I spent most of my life thinking that men in masks were only capable of doing horrible things.
I may have to reevaluate that.
Let me know when Queen gets in.
Will do.
Are you all right?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I mean, I barely knew the kid, Thea.
But that doesn't make it sting any less.
Well, yeah, sure it does.
The year I've had, this is... this is easy.
Yeah.
I mean, cold as that sounds.
Look.
I know why you're asking, ok, and I'm...
I'm fine.
Ok.
I mean, I'm...
I'm...
I'm just saying if things ever get less easy, you know I'm here for you, right?
Noted...
And appreciated.
Ok.
What is the point of having keyhole satellite imagery if you can't use it to find anybody?
I feel like I don't understand half the sentences you say.
What I'm saying is is that no matter how hard I try
I cannot find Rene anywhere.
And I was the one who told you guys to leave him behind.
Sounds like another impossible decision.
Does that mean I'm supposed to get better at making them?
I'm saying you were right.
If we're gonna do this, we can't let guilt swallow us up.
I'll keep you from doing it if you promise the same for me.
Deal.
Curtis:
Ow!
Ow!
Ow!
Evelyn:
So "ow" then?
Things have really fallen apart without Oliver, haven't they?
It's a good thing I'm back then.
Was he waiting for an entrance line?
Nope.
He's just that cool.
I got your text.
Have we found Rene?
You get John?
Yeah.
He's fine.
He's holed up at HIVE.
I couldn't write him off, and we... are not gonna write off Rene.
We're gonna find him, we're gonna bring him back...
Wherever he is.
Church:
Ah.
Wakey, wakey.
Yow!
Yow!
Heh heh heh.
Hey.
Man, it's been a long time since I've been tagged like this.
Respect.
Oh, my pleasure, but I promise you if you untie me
I'll show you a hell of a lot more than respect.
Ooh, man, you got spirit, and I am duly impressed, but I'm gonna break that spirit.
I'm gonna break your soul, and when we're finished, assuming that you're still alive...
Now I wouldn't bet no money on that, though...
There's gonna be very little of you left for the Green Arrow to work with.
Light him up.
[Screaming]
Precisely Synchronized by srjanapala
Greg!
Move your head.
My name is Oliver Queen.
After 5 years in Hell,
I returned home with only one goal-- to save my city.
Today, I fight that war on two fronts.
By day, I lead Star City as its mayor, but by night, I am someone else.
I am something else.
I am the Green Arrow.
Previously on "Arrow"...
Former police Captain Quentin Lance, who will be serving beside me as Deputy Mayor.
Appreciate the vote of confidence, Mr. Mayor.
Are you not from Star City?
No.
Havenrock.
Felicity, voice-over:
There's something that I need you to know.
Havenrock was not the intended target.
Someone redirected the missile to reduce the number of casualties.
That someone was me.
Ever since I killed Andy...
You think you need to be punished.
Stop fighting for me, Lyla.
We need to talk about John.
He's back in the country, and he's in prison, and I need you to break him out.
Come on, Mr. Olympia.
Hustle up.
Mr. Olympia's a bodybuilding competition.
I was--am an Olympic athlete.
Yeah?
They give out gold medals for effort now?
Very funny, and it was a bronze medal.
Why is that so hard to remember?
Quiet.
Every time you're out in the field, you could die.
Don't forget that, don't lose focus.
Overwatch, do we have the target?
Headed toward the east exit, closing fast.
Do we know what he stole?
Not yet, but I have a feeling we're about to find out.
Only if we snag him in the cordon.
Artemis, be ready.
Does this mean I actually get to shoot someone?
I mean, not, you know, shoot someone shoot someone.
I just meant that more than--
We know what you meant.
You wait for him to reach the cordon, then engage.
- Do you copy?
- Copy.
- Copy.
- Copy.
Still a lot of ground to cover.
Rag's should be here.
Overwatch, do you have a 20 on Ragman?
I texted him, like, 10 times and then 10 more, but Nada.
Maybe he's sick.
I mean, the flu's been going around, and by the looks of those rags, he does not hit the drycleaner very often.
Hola, muchacho.
Wild Dog, that is Artemis' shot.
I got him.
What the?
I got him.
What did I say?
That was Artemis' shot!
Dude was getting away.
No, he wasn't.
And you missed.
You were in the Navy.
You should know better.
I was dishonorably discharged actually.
You think that I don't know that?
Deliver that and the evidence to the anti-crime unit and then go home.
What about tonight's training session?
You're taking a few days off.
Nice going...again.
How are we supposed to get this buy to the ACU, call a Uber?

Oliver.
The Op's over, and you've been MIA for days.
It's not acceptable.
Get it together immediately, or you're off the team.
That's why I'm here, to tell you in person.
I'm off the team.
Feels pretty quick to throw in the towel.
I thought you were just getting started.
I was, and then Felicity told me the truth about her role in Havenrock.
You didn't know she told me.
Did she also tell you that she was faced with an impossible choice?
I completely realize that.
I get it wasn't her fault, but that doesn't change the fact that every time I look at her
I see the faces of my family, of everyone I ever loved.
Felicity is a constant reminder of what I lost, and as long as that's true,
I'm sorry.
I can't be here.
What about your father?
I thought he was the reason you were doing this.
I'll have to find another way to honor him.
I'm sorry to lose you.
I'm sorry to go.
Thank you for everything.
Did my comms deceive me, or did you actually let the recruits take an SCPD victory lap?
It's never a victory lap.
They're rough around the edges, but they're making progress except Rory, who was waiting for me upstairs to say that he quit.
He said you spoke with him about Havenrock.
Hey.
How you holding up?
She doesn't know?
About John being in prison?
Oliver told me.
I'm so sorry.
What Lyla means-- we are gonna break him out.
Of military prison?
- Yep.
- Wait, and then what?
John is just a fugitive for the rest of his life?
Better than being punished for something he didn't do.
Lyla, I've been studying the schematics that you hooked me up with.
This would be a lot easier if we had John's cooperation.
U don't have what now?
Apparently, prison is more appealing to John than coming home to his own wife and child.
Ok.
So wait a minute.
Not only do you want to commit multiple felonies and make John a wanted man for the rest of his life, he doesn't actually want you to?
Can I speak with you for a minute?
Yeah.
Is she going to be a problem?
No, but...
I was counting on her being a help.
Maybe I should pull a few of my agents in on this.
No.
If this--if this has your fingerprints on it, then both of John Jr.'s parents will be fugitives.
There is something that might actually make this not impossible.
I just read a briefing memo on a new piece of tech, an antimolecular compound.
I was kind of hoping Felicity could help us get our hands on it.
Lyla, whatever it is, I'll handle it.
Second test over.
Do not make any worse by pulling out suture.
Anatoly, if this is how the Bratva treat their new members,
I'd hate to see how they treat their enemies.
Pass third and final test, find out.
What's the test?
You keep asking about Kovar.
Our sources say this man will get you one step closer.
You have to act fast, though.
He will be arraigned in morning.
Arraigned?
- Jail.
- Yeah, but what makes you think he'll talk to me.
You trust me.
I trust you.
Look.
It's a little early for a drink, don't you think?
It's not for drinking.
Anatoly, what the hell was that for?
I should probably just start prerecording apologies for being late.
Don't worry.
Thea told us.
I'm sorry, man.
Gout is a bitch.
Yes, it is.
I'm actually gonna be taking some time off to have it taken care of.
Well, fortunately, we now have a deputy mayor to help pick up the slack.
It'll be great working with you.
You've had an impressive career, Mr. Lance?
Yeah.
I mean, a lot of people out there probably wouldn't, uh, share that opinion, but thank you.
Public service isn't easy.
Sometimes, you get a little dirty clearing out the filth.
Speaking of which, I heard there was an arrest last night that may help in our case against Tobias Church.
Sergio Espinosa, long-time Los Halcones member turned Church strongman.
The Green Arrow and his merry band of vigilantes left him gift-wrapped for us at anti-crime.
The only thing that was missing was a bow.
Well, you don't sound to happy about that.
Vigilantes are a superficial solution.
If we need their help to get our streets clean--
It means we haven't done our jobs right.
Do you think that you can get Espinosa to flip on Church?
I'll lean on him hard, see if he buckles.
Make sure he doesn't get any help from crooked cops.
Not a chance.
I'm gonna walk every piece of evidence in the custody chain through myself.
Good.
Uh, if it's all right with you,
I'll have Quentin accompany you, be my eyes and ears while I'm out of town.
Sure.
Give us a little bit of time to get acquainted.
Heh.
Great.
I'm sorry.
When did, uh, babysitting evidence become part of the job description?
Since I trust you.
You do?
I mean, all things considered?
If we didn't think you were right for the job, we wouldn't have offered it to you, right?
I haven't had a drink in a week, ok?
Where the hell are you going anyway?
Strange time for a vacation.
You should probably assume that it's not a vacation.
Should I even ask?
No.
I--I'm not gonna be gone long.
Just please make sure that no one destroys the city while I'm away.
Sure.
Ok.
What are you doing?
Reviewing the SCPD evidence log on what we kept from getting stolen from Kord Industries last night.
- 6,800 processor.
- So?
Exactly.
Kord manufactures bleeding-edge tech, military-grade weapons,
I mean, all kinds of city-threatening items.
Why would Church send a guy to steal a computer chip that you could buy from any Tech Village store?
Well, who cares?
Everything's on its way to lockup now.
Because knowing what Church's endgame was is like--it's like this thing that's still out there, lurking.
You all right over there?
Because I've been doing a lot of talking, and you haven't, which is very weird.
Ha!
You know how you told me to tell Rory about Havenrock?
Yeah.
Oh!
He's not sick with the flu, is he?
No.
He's just sick of working with me.
Did you try talking to him?
There's not a lot I can say that would make him feel ok about his entire family being killed.
Incoming.
Another robbery in progress at--
Palmer Tech!
I got to call Oliver.
Or maybe don't, and we'll just let the get robbed.
It will serve Mr. Dennis right for firing us.
He fired me.
You quit.
Because he fired you.
Same thing.
Sanchez, you got anything?
Nada.
What's up?
Hey.
There's been a break-in at Palmer Tech.
Are you still in the area?
Uh...
Yeah.
I can look into that.
How was Palmer Tech?
Before you answer, you should consider that your phone has GPS, and if you were thinking about lying,
I do admire your consistency.
I wasn't thinking of lying to you.
I wasn't looping you in after you made it clear you didn't approve of the decision.
John is the one who doesn't approve of the plan.
John's not thinking clearly.
Well, I bet Roy is, and if he were here,
I think he would tell you that life on the run is no life at all, and I seem to remember you not being on board with that plan.
Roy was making a bad choice just like John is making a bad choice.
He is currently locked up in a military prison for a crime he didn't commit.
To atone for a crime that he did commit, and what does it matter?
John doesn't want to leave.
It is not your choice.
Why do you always have to go and make decisions for him?
He already abandoned the team.
I am not gonna let him abandon his family.
Is that what this is about,
John leaving the team?
This is simple.
I am gonna stop John from making a decision he will come to regret.
You should consider doing the exact same thing with Rory.
You do realize that me having a chat with Rory is completely different than you committing half a dozen felonies, right?
Did you ever think you'd be doing this again, handling evidence?
No.
Didn't think I'd be deputy mayor either, but here we are.
I was surprised you took the job, to be honest.
From what I hear, you and Queen have a, uh-- a complicated history.
Got to be a lot of hatchets to bury there.
Yeah.
Well, at least I know where they're buried.
That's something you can't buy or steal.
Package is here, boss.
D.A., Deputy Mayor, too.
Ah.
Bonus.
Get ready to move.
Let me guess.
Felicity filled you in.
That you're gonna break into a military prison?
Yeah, and you got the nerve to call me Wild Dog?
I'm done debating this.
Really?
Because this is the first we've heard of it.
I thought we were your team.
Running off to bust someone out of prison sounds like team business, and what happens to us when you get caught?
You've made it clear that we can't do this vigilante thing without you.
When I get caught?
I'm not gonna get caught.
Right because we're not gonna let you do this.
I'm sorry.
Did you say that you're not gonna let me?
Yes.
I need to see you physically deposit the item.
I've been on this job 15 years.
I've never lost a piece of evidence.
Now relax, Sergeant.
No one's doubting your proficiency here, ok?
Seems like.
This is it.
You gonna let me do my job now?
Have at it.
- What the hell?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Get out of here!
Whoo!
Find the weapons, boys.
Ahh.
Sorry, gents.
Load them up!
And burn this puppy down.
Let's go, let's go!
Ok.
Last chance.
Get off the street.
I didn't think he'd actually hit you guys.
You know what really sucks?
Realizing that in all those training sessions where he was kicking our respective asses the whole time he was taking it easy on us.
Yeah.
Remind me to never, ever get on his bad side.
I think that would imply that he has a good side, and, you know, Felicity, could you please explain to me again how you thought this was all gonna go down?
Well, I thought if he saw you guys all united against his crazy plan he'd reconsider.
Right because Oliver Queen is known for thinking things through and taking input from others.
Right.
Wow.
The ever-expanding club house.
And who are you?
I'm Thea, Oliver's Chief of Staff.
And also his sister.
Don't tell me Oliver beat you up, too?
Heh.
Ollie did this?
Object lesson, long story.
It's fine.
Don't ask.
What happened to you?
Tobias Church happened.
That evidence that you guys recovered from Kord Industries-- modified to go boom.
He wanted it to be put into lockup.
And he wanted to raid it.
One-stop shopping for weapons.
Including those RPGs that he took from Amertek if this report's right.
We got to find out what he's planning to do with those weapons-- because it ain't nothing good.
This is a really bad time for Oliver to be out of town.
Yeah.
I just tried him.
He's gone dark.
Why don't you guys hit the streets?
We want to figure out what Church is up to before it's too late.
- You sure?
- Mm-hmm.
I don't think Oliver would want us out there without him.
Right.
Well, Oliver forfeited his opinion when he left.
Ok, but this is an all hands on deck situation, rag-covered hands included.
Just saying.
Where's Private Jesseman?
This is usually his delivery.
Flu's been tearing through the base, sir.
I drew the short straw.
I don't see you on the list.
Your C.O. should have submitted a change of personnel form.
You sure he didn't?
It's an hour's drive back to the base.
Can't you refresh your Wi-Fi or something?
There you are.
As you were, Private.
Thank you, sir.
I'm in.
25 minutes till extraction.
Roger that.
Facilities cameras are on a closed network.
If you can give me access to the mainframe, I can open it up.
- I'm on my way.
- Oliver...
If you don't make it to the extraction point--
I'll make it, and I won't be alone.
Ahem.
Ohh.
Ahh.
Hey.
You speak English?
Yes.
Your accent-- you are American.
Yeah, maybe once upon a time, but, uh, now I'm more just enjoying everything that Russia has to offer.
Yes.
I can smell that.
You judge me?
You're in this cell, too.
Yes.
A mistake my boss will correct very soon.
You mean Konstantin Kovar?
How do you know that name?
Oh, same way that I know your name's Pyotr Friedkin, same way I know that you launder money for Kovar, same way that I know that's what you're doing here.
How can you know that unless...
Are you Bratva?
He's fine.
Mmm.
I am Bratva, and you are gonna tell me everything that I want to know.
Your turn to run system check.
I'm gonna hit the head.
Don't touch my ball.
Dude, what the hell?
Transponder's in place.
Roger that.
I've got eyes now.
I'll walk you to Johnny's cell.
Hey!
Hey.
Is this--uh, is this a bad time?
Do I want to even ask how you found me?
Heh.
I feel like that's a trick question.
Sorry about the mess.
Wow!
These are amazing.
You spend enough time with other people's castoffs, you find ways to make something useful out of them.
My father always used to say that.
He owned a pawn shop.
On Southmoor Road, right?
How'd you know?
Last week, you told Oliver that you had joined the team to honor your father.
When you quit...
I wanted to find out more about what you were giving up.
Your father was a Gulf War veteran, 2nd Battalion, 1st Marines, but that's not what made him a hero, was it?
No.
He wore your rags, his father before him, whose name was also Rory.
That's a big legacy to live up to.
Mine is going to be what happened to Havenrock.
I'm gonna have to live with that every day for the rest of my life, knowing that I cannot fix it and knowing that it's not the last mistake that I'm ever going to have to make.
I still don't know if I can--
Work side by side with someone who's a reminder of what you lost.
I understand.
Just like you're a reminder of what I did, and I--I know they're not the same thing.
We both want the same thing, to be able to live with what's happened so that we can move forward.
It's Curtis.
I am so sorry, and we could really use you.
I--I wish I could, Felicity.
I just...
I can't right now.
I'm sorry.
If you change your mind, well, we're here.
Cell 1138, right side, third from the left.
He's not here.
Give me a minute while I scan the feeds.
Oh, no.
What?
They moved him into gen pop.
You go in there, neither of you are getting out.
Talk to me.
When's he coming back to his cell?
Outside our window.
If those MPs wake up, the first thing they're gonna do is move John and all the other prisoners to a more secure location, and we lose our shot.
Abort.
We're blown.
Tell me where I can find Kovar.
You think you scare me more than him?
No, but he's not locked up in here with you.
I am.
You wouldn't kill me in front of all of them.
I'm not gonna lay a finger on you.
Same can't be said for Alisa.
Or maybe I'll visit your wife Maya when she's picking up Alisa from ballet.
Somebody is gonna die.
It can be Kovar, it can be your wife, it can be your child, but I need you to choose and do it quickly.
Kovar is very paranoid, careful.
We never meet in person, only remotely.
Remotely?
How?
A digital dead drop, the Dark Web.
What's the IP address?
What is the IP address?
108.166.7.161.
If this information is incorrect, your family will suffer.
How does an American become this...
This...
Bratva devil?
I don't know.
About time, Blondie.
Can we go now?
First of all, not my name.
Second, were you able to locate Church on your recon?
No, but street cams actually picked him up, so we know he's on the move.
We just don't know where he's moving to.
We can't go after Church without knowing his endgame first.
Sounds like an excuse to sit around and do nothing.
What are you doing?
Not nothing.
You're cross-plotting
Church's prior locations into a projection algorithm.
Hmm.
You probably got beat up in grade school a lot.
And junior high.
Ok.
Based on Church's route, I'm calculating an 86% likelihood he's going to 18 Mill Road.
Why does that sound so familiar?
Because we were just there to hand over Sergio.
That's where the ACU's bunkered.
Church is gonna take them out.
Montes, quit screwing around.
Station chief, this is Gans from cell block "C."
We have a code yellow situation.
Initiate immediate lockdown and have all prisoners return to their cells.
I'm not rolling on Church.
You think you scare me more than him?
Hmm.
No...
But he's not here with you.
I am.
Hmm.
You're not gonna put a beating on me.
You're a D.A.
Yeah.
Haven't you heard?
All of the justice in this city comes from vigilantes.
Word on the street is is that Church's planning something, something big.
You tell me what it is, and he'll be the one in those cuffs instead of you.
Heh heh heh.
You're talking about the trust.
Oh, you can't stop it, man.
Can't even come close.
What's going on?
Church.
At least we definitely know where Church is now.
D'Angelo's right.
We got to put him down.
Against that?
Without Oliver?
No.
We're sh-- shorthanded as it is.
You scared?
No, but I'm not stupid either.
Evie's right.
I'm not sending you guys out there just to get slaughtered.
Thanks for the vote of confidence.
You saw what you're up against, ok?
This isn't some drill where you take down a petty thug or drug dealer.
This is real, ok, with real stakes.
The 3 of you could die out there.
That's something we get to decide for ourselves, isn't it?
I mean, I don't know about everyone else, but I didn't join this team to stay safe.
Ok.
Why don't we take a vote?
All those in favor.
We're all gonna say yes, Blondie.
God.
That's not my name.
Good.
Ok.
Go.
Do not die.
Code yellow.
Return all prisoners to their cells.
Code yellow.
Return all prisoners to their cells.
Immediate code yellow enforced.
Move prisoners to their cells.
Hey, John.
What's new?
I'm not doing this.
I told Lyla.
Yeah.
You can yell at us later, but right now, we're on a bit of a clock.
Are you even hearing me right now?
I don't want anything to do with this.
The MPs are gonna do a count in a few minutes.
My guess is they're only expecting to find one person in here.
Really?
So that's your play, blackmail?
Do what you say, or you get caught in here, too?
You're my brother, John.
What happens to you happens to me.
Oliver...
I killed my brother.
I went to the army to change, and I haven't changed.
I know, all right, and I know that you think this is your penance for that.
Oliver, it's not just that.
I trusted Andy.
Even when you told me not to, I trusted him, and now Laurel's dead.
I need you, the team needs you, the city needs you.
I'm not saying you shouldn't do your penance.
You probably should, but do it as Spartan.
What's in the box?
It's an antimolecular compound, and theoretically, it should eat through anything.
Not gonna ask you how you got your hands on this.
Hey.
You came back for me, even against my wishes.
I guess I haven't changed that much either.
Maybe that's what I have to do my penance for.
That toy of yours is definitely coming in handy.
Project that Lyla's been keeping an eye on for Argus.
Should have known she'd be helping out.
Tell Johnny he can thank me later.
You've got to keep moving.
Follow the sublevel north 200 meters, then climb up.
What--what is it?
Comm's being jammed.
No, no, no.
Hey.
Is there another way out of here?
Mind uncuffing me before they kill you?
Hi.
Hey.
Hey.
If that's for taking out the wall, the blast will kill us before we can get out.
We're in too tight.
- Trust me.
- Yeah, says the creepy-looking--
What the hell are you anyways?
I'm in place.
Blow it.
Sorry we blew up your building.
Come on!
We're going up.
Then what?
Which way, Overwatch?
Take a right at the end of that hallway.
It should be a fire exit.
If you go through there, you're home free easy.
Not so easy.
Rags, cover me.
Go!
Go, go!
Unh!
Get him up.
Come on.
I probably should just shoot you, but...
But you've earned a little suffering.
Get him to safety.
- But--
- Go!
It's ok.
Hey.
Don't kill him.
He may have his uses.
We've got to go back for Wild Dog.
Copy.
Overwatch, Mr. Terrific is hurt.
We could use some help.
Inbound.
Hold on.
Get in!
Where's the Wild Dog kid?
Still inside, fighting Church.
We've got to go back for him.
No.
Unless you all want to die, we've got to go now, now!
We can't just leave him.
You have to.
Go.
Come on!
Let's go.
- Here.
- What's this?
Just put it on.
Let's go.
Dig, your harness.
You two, freeze!
Down on the ground!
Lace your fingers behind your head!
Do it now, or we will shoot!
John, don't move.
This place should keep you off the grid for the time being.
Until we find a permanent solution.
Hey.
First things first.
Can't believe you broke me out of prison.
For better or worse, Johnny.
Told you I wanted to stay.
And I figured if you wanted to make your own decisions then you wouldn't haven't gotten married.
Ok.
How mad was Felicity that you went along with this?
How do you know she thought it was a bad idea?
I know Felicity.
What's wrong?
I have to go.
Hey.
When you said you haven't changed...
Don't.
Dobroye utro.
How was first night in Russian prison?
Friedkin gave up the dead drop, and now he's dead.
Mission accomplished.
Your being sarcasm, yes?
That man wasn't a threat, Anatoly.
He didn't deserve to die.
In Bratva, there is no death without purpose.
If Friedkin living, he is warning Kovar.
If he is warning Kovar, his information not so good.
Vy ponimayete?
Maybe you could have explained that to me before you sent me in there.
I almost didn't kill him.
But you did.
Why?
Because you told me to.
You trust us.
Now we trust you.
Third test over.
You get it?
You are Bratva now, family.
Last handful of honest cops in this city, and Church nearly took them out along with me.
We're just glad you're all right.
I've got to be thinking this is a PR nightmare, something like this going down and the mayor's MIA.
Look.
He called in this morning.
His health problems are almost over.
That's good news.
Um, we're--we're hearing that one of the, uh, vigilantes who was part of the rescue, that he didn't make it out.
Um, any word on him?
CSU hasn't found a body, so...
So Church has him.
I spent most of my life thinking that men in masks were only capable of doing horrible things.
I may have to reevaluate that.
Let me know when Queen gets in.
Will do.
Are you all right?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I mean, I barely knew the kid, Thea.
But that doesn't make it sting any less.
Well, yeah, sure it does.
The year I've had, this is--this is easy.
Yeah.
I mean, cold as that sounds.
Look.
I know why you're asking, ok, and I'm--I'm fine.
Ok.
I mean, I'm--I'm-- I'm just saying if things ever get less easy, you know I'm here for you, right?
Noted...
And appreciated.
Ok.
What is the point of having keyhole satellite imagery if you can't use it to find anybody?
I feel like I don't understand half the sentences you say.
What I'm saying is is that no matter how hard I try
I cannot find Rene anywhere.
And I was the one who told you guys to leave him behind.
Sounds like another impossible decision.
Does that mean I'm supposed to get better at making them?
I'm saying you were right.
If we're gonna do this, we can't let guilt swallow us up.
I'll keep you from doing it if you promise the same for me.
Deal.
Ow!
Ow!
Ow!
So "ow" then?
Things have really fallen apart without Oliver, haven't they?
It's a good thing I'm back then.
Was he waiting for an entrance line?
Nope.
He's just that cool.
I got your text.
Have we found Rene?
You get John?
Yeah.
He's fine.
He's holed up at HIVE.
I couldn't write him off, and we are not gonna write off Rene.
We're gonna find him, we're gonna bring him back...
Wherever he is.
Ah.
Wakey, wakey.
Yow!
Yow!
Heh heh heh.
Hey.
Man, it's been a long time since I've been tagged like this.
Respect.
Oh, my pleasure, but I promise you if you untie me
I'll show you a hell of a lot more than respect.
Ooh, man, you got spirit, and I am duly impressed, but I'm gonna break that spirit.
I'm gonna break your soul, and when we're finished, assuming that you're still alive-- now I wouldn't bet no money on that, though-- there's gonna be very little of you left
for the Green Arrow to work with.
Light him up.
== sync, corrected by elderman == @elder_man
Greg!
Move your head.
My name is Oliver Queen.
After 5 years in Hell,
I returned home with only one goal...
To save my city.
Today, I fight that war on two fronts.
By day, I lead Star City as its mayor, but by night, I am someone else.
I am something else.
I am the Green Arrow.
Previously on "Arrow"...
Former police Captain Quentin Lance, who will be serving beside me as Deputy Mayor.
Appreciate the vote of confidence, Mr. Mayor.
Are you not from Star City?
No.
Havenrock.
Felicity, voice-over:
There's something that I need you to know.
Havenrock was not the intended target.
Someone redirected the missile to reduce the number of casualties.
That someone was me.
Ever since I killed Andy...
You think you need to be punished.
Stop fighting for me, Lyla.
We need to talk about John.
He's back in the country, and he's in prison, and I need you to break him out.
Come on, Mr. Olympia.
Hustle up.
Mr. Olympia's a bodybuilding competition.
I was... am an Olympic athlete.
Yeah?
They give out gold medals for effort now?
Very funny, and it was a bronze medal.
Why is that so hard to remember?
Quiet.
Every time you're out in the field, you could die.
Don't forget that, don't lose focus.
Overwatch, do we have the target?
Headed toward the east exit, closing fast.
Do we know what he stole?
Not yet, but I have a feeling we're about to find out.
Only if we snag him in the cordon.
Artemis, be ready.
Does this mean I actually get to shoot someone?
I mean, not, you know, shoot someone shoot someone.
I just meant that more than...
We know what you meant.
You wait for him to reach the Cordon, then engage.
Do you copy?
Copy.
- Copy.
- Copy.
Still a lot of ground to cover.
Rag's should be here.
Overwatch, do you have a 20 on Ragman?
I texted him, like, 10 times and then 10 more, but Nada.
Maybe he's sick.
I mean, the flu's been going around, and by the looks of those rags, he does not hit the drycleaner very often.
Hola, muchacho.
Wild Dog, that is Artemis' shot.
I got him.
What the?
I got him.
What did I say?
That was Artemis' shot!
Dude was getting away.
No, he wasn't.
And you missed.
You were in the Navy.
You should know better.
I was dishonorably discharged actually.
You think that I don't know that?
Deliver that and the evidence to the anti-crime unit and then go home.
What about tonight's training session?
You're taking a few days off.
Nice going... again.
How are we supposed to get this buy to the ACU, call a Uber?
* ARROW * Season 05 Episode 04 "Penance" Precisely Synchronized by srjanapala
Oliver.
The Op's over, and you've been MIA for days.
It's not acceptable.
Get it together immediately, or you're off the team.
That's why I'm here, to tell you in person.
I'm off the team.
Feels pretty quick to throw in the towel.
I thought you were just getting started.
I was, and then Felicity told me the truth about her role in Havenrock.
You didn't know she told me.
Did she also tell you that she was faced with an impossible choice?
I completely realize that.
I get it wasn't her fault, but that doesn't change the fact that every time I look at her
I see the faces of my family, of everyone I ever loved.
Felicity is a constant reminder of what I lost, and as long as that's true,
I'm sorry.
I can't be here.
What about your father?
I thought he was the reason you were doing this.
I'll have to find another way to honor him.
I'm sorry to lose you.
I'm sorry to go.
Thank you for everything.
Did my comms deceive me, or did you actually let the recruits take an SCPD victory lap?
It's never a victory lap.
They're... rough around the edges, but they're making progress... except Rory, who was waiting for me upstairs to say that he quit.
He said you spoke with him about Havenrock.
Hey.
How you holding up?
She doesn't know?
About John being in prison?
Oliver told me.
I'm so sorry.
What Lyla means...
We are gonna break him out.
Of military prison?
- Yep.
- Wait, and then what?
John is just a fugitive for the rest of his life?
Better than being punished for something he didn't do.
Lyla, I've been studying the schematics that you hooked me up with.
This would be a lot easier if we had John's cooperation.
U don't have what now?
Apparently, prison is more appealing to John than coming home to his own wife and child.
Ok.
So wait a minute.
Not only do you want to commit multiple felonies and make John a wanted man for the rest of his life, he doesn't actually want you to?
Can I speak with you for a minute?
Yeah.
Is she going to be a problem?
No, but...
I was counting on her being a help.
Maybe I should pull a few of my agents in on this.
No.
If this... if this has your fingerprints on it, then both of John Jr.'s parents will be fugitives.
There is something that might actually make this not impossible.
I just read a briefing memo on a new piece of tech, an antimolecular compound.
I was kind of hoping Felicity could help us get our hands on it.
Lyla, whatever it is, I'll handle it.
Second test over.
Do not make any worse by pulling out suture.
Anatoly, if this is how the Bratva treat their new members,
I'd hate to see how they treat their enemies.
Pass third and final test, find out.
What's the test?
You keep asking about Kovar.
Our sources say this man will get you one step closer.
You have to act fast, though.
He will be arraigned in morning.
Arraigned?
- Jail.
- Yeah, but... what makes you think he'll talk to me.
You trust me.
I trust you.
Look.
It's a little early for a drink, don't you think?
It's not for drinking.
Anatoly, what the hell was that for?
I should probably just start prerecording apologies for being late.
Don't worry.
Thea told us.
I'm sorry, man.
Gout is a bitch.
Yes, it is.
I'm actually gonna be taking some time off to have it taken care of.
Well, fortunately, we now have a deputy mayor to help pick up the slack.
It'll be great working with you.
You've had an impressive career, Mr. Lance?
Yeah.
I mean, a lot of people out there probably wouldn't, uh, share that opinion, but thank you.
Public service isn't easy.
Sometimes, you get a little dirty clearing out the filth.
Speaking of which, I heard there was an arrest last night that may help in our case against Tobias Church.
Sergio Espinosa, long-time Los Halcones member turned Church strongman.
The Green Arrow and his merry band of vigilantes left him gift-wrapped for us at anti-crime.
The only thing that was missing was a bow.
Well, you don't sound to happy about that.
Vigilantes are a superficial solution.
If we need their help to get our streets clean...
It means we haven't done our jobs right.
Do you think that you can get Espinosa to flip on Church?
I'll lean on him hard, see if he buckles.
Make sure he doesn't get any help from crooked cops.
Not a chance.
I'm gonna walk every piece of evidence in the custody chain through myself.
Good.
Uh, if it's all right with you,
I'll have Quentin accompany you, be my... eyes and ears while I'm out of town.
Sure.
Give us a little bit of time to get acquainted.
Heh.
Great.
I'm sorry.
When did, uh, babysitting evidence become part of the job description?
Since I trust you.
You do?
I mean, all things considered?
If we didn't think you were right for the job, we wouldn't have offered it to you, right?
I haven't had a drink in a week, ok?
Where the hell are you going anyway?
Strange time for a vacation.
You should probably assume that it's not a vacation.
Should I even ask?
No.
I...
I'm not gonna be gone long.
Just please make sure that no one destroys the city while I'm away.
Sure.
Ok.
What are you doing?
Reviewing the SCPD evidence log on what we kept from getting stolen from Kord Industries last night.
- 6,800 processor.
- So?
Exactly.
Kord manufactures bleeding-edge tech, military-grade weapons,
I mean, all kinds of city-threatening items.
Why would Church send a guy to steal a computer chip that you could buy from any Tech Village store?
Well, who cares?
Everything's on its way to lockup now.
Because knowing what Church's endgame was is like... it's like this thing that's still out there, lurking.
You all right over there?
Because I've been doing a lot of talking, and you haven't, which is very weird.
Ha!
You know how you told me to tell Rory about Havenrock?
Yeah.
Oh!
He's not sick with the flu, is he?
No.
He's just sick of working with me.
Did you try talking to him?
There's not a lot I can say that would make him feel ok about his entire family being killed.
Incoming.
Another robbery in progress at...
Palmer Tech!
I got to call Oliver.
Or maybe don't, and we'll just let the get robbed.
It will serve Mr. Dennis right for firing us.
He fired me.
You quit.
Because he fired you.
Same thing.
Sanchez, you got anything?
Nada.
What's up?
Hey.
There's been a break-in at Palmer Tech.
Are you still in the area?
Uh...
Yeah.
I can look into that.
How was Palmer Tech?
Before you answer, you should consider that your phone has GPS, and if you were thinking about lying,
I do admire your consistency.
I wasn't thinking of lying to you.
I wasn't looping you in after you made it clear you didn't approve of the decision.
John is the one who doesn't approve of the plan.
John's not thinking clearly.
Well, I bet Roy is, and if he were here,
I think he would tell you that life on the run is no life at all, and I seem to remember you not being on board with that plan.
Roy was making a bad choice just like John is making a bad choice.
He is currently locked up in a military prison for a crime he didn't commit.
To atone for a crime that he did commit, and what does it matter?
John doesn't want to leave.
It is not your choice.
Why do you always have to go and make decisions for him?
He already abandoned the team.
I am not gonna let him abandon his family.
Is that what this is about,
John leaving the team?
This is simple.
I am gonna stop John from making a decision he will come to regret.
You should consider doing the exact same thing with Rory.
You do realize that me having a chat with Rory is completely different than you committing half a dozen felonies, right?
Did you ever think you'd be doing this again, handling evidence?
No.
Didn't think I'd be deputy mayor either, but here we are.
I was surprised you took the job, to be honest.
From what I hear, you and Queen have a, uh...
A complicated history.
Got to be a lot of hatchets to bury there.
Yeah.
Well, at least I know where they're buried.
That's something you can't buy or steal.
Package is here, boss.
D.A., Deputy Mayor, too.
Ah.
Bonus.
Get ready to move.
Let me guess.
Felicity filled you in.
That you're gonna break into a military prison?
Yeah, and you got the nerve to call me Wild Dog?
I'm done debating this.
Really?
Because this is the first we've heard of it.
I thought we were your team.
Running off to bust someone out of prison sounds like team business, and what happens to us when you get caught?
You've made it clear that we can't do this vigilante thing without you.
When I get caught?
I'm not gonna get caught.
Right because we're not gonna let you do this.
I'm sorry.
Did you say that you're not gonna let me?
Yes.
I need to see you physically deposit the item.
I've been on this job 15 years.
I've never lost a piece of evidence.
Now relax, Sergeant.
No one's doubting your proficiency here, ok?
Seems like.
This is it.
You gonna let me do my job now?
Have at it.
- What the hell?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Get out of here!
Whoo!
Find the weapons, boys.
Ahh.
Sorry, gents.
Load them up!
And burn this puppy down.
Let's go, let's go!
Ok.
Last chance.
Get off the street.
I didn't think he'd actually hit you guys.
You know what really sucks?
Realizing that in all those training sessions where he was kicking our respective asses the whole time he was taking it easy on us.
Yeah.
Remind me to never, ever get on his bad side.
I think that would imply that he has a good side, and, you know, Felicity, could you please explain to me again how you thought this was all gonna go down?
Well, I thought if he saw you guys all united against his crazy plan he'd reconsider.
Right because Oliver Queen is known for thinking things through and taking input from others.
Right.
Wow.
The ever-expanding club house.
And who are you?
I'm Thea, Oliver's Chief of Staff.
And also his sister.
Don't tell me Oliver beat you up, too?
Heh.
Ollie did this?
Object lesson, long story.
It's fine.
Don't ask.
What happened to you?
Tobias Church happened.
That evidence that you guys recovered from Kord Industries...
Modified to go boom.
He wanted it to be put into lockup.
And he wanted to raid it.
One-stop shopping for weapons.
Including those RPGs that he took from Amertek if this report's right.
We got to find out what he's planning to do with those weapons...
Because it ain't nothing good.
This is a really bad time for Oliver to be out of town.
Yeah.
I just tried him.
He's gone dark.
Why don't you guys hit the streets?
We want to figure out what Church is up to before it's too late.
- You sure?
- Mm-hmm.
I don't think Oliver would want us out there without him.
Right.
Well, Oliver forfeited his opinion when he left.
Ok, but this is an all hands on deck situation, rag-covered hands included.
Just saying.
Where's Private Jesseman?
This is usually his delivery.
Flu's been tearing through the base, sir.
I drew the short straw.
I don't see you on the list.
Your C.O. should have submitted a change of personnel form.
You sure he didn't?
It's an hour's drive back to the base.
Can't you refresh your Wi-Fi or something?
There you are.
As you were, Private.
Thank you, sir.
I'm in.
25 minutes till extraction.
Roger that.
Facilities cameras are on a closed network.
If you can give me access to the mainframe, I can open it up.
- I'm on my way.
- Oliver...
If you don't make it to the extraction point...
I'll make it, and I won't be alone.
Ahem.
Ohh.
Ahh.
Hey.
You speak English?
Yes.
Your accent...
You are American.
Yeah, maybe once upon a time, but, uh, now I'm more just enjoying everything that Russia has to offer.
Yes.
I can smell that.
You judge me?
You're in this cell, too.
Yes.
A mistake my boss will correct very soon.
You mean Konstantin Kovar?
How do you know that name?
Oh, same way that I know your name's Pyotr Friedkin, same way I know that you launder money for Kovar, same way that I know that's what you're doing here.
How can you know that unless...
Are you Bratva?
He's fine.
Mmm.
I am Bratva, and you are gonna tell me everything that I want to know.
Your turn to run system check.
I'm gonna hit the head.
Don't touch my ball.
Dude, what the hell?
Transponder's in place.
Roger that.
I've got eyes now.
I'll walk you to Johnny's cell.
Hey!
Hey.
Is this... uh, is this a bad time?
Do I want to even ask how you found me?
Heh.
I feel like that's a trick question.
Sorry about the mess.
Wow!
These are amazing.
You spend enough time with other people's castoffs, you find ways to make something useful out of them.
My father always used to say that.
He owned a pawn shop.
On Southmoor Road, right?
How'd you know?
Last week, you told Oliver that you had joined the team to honor your father.
When you quit...
I wanted to find out more about what you were giving up.
Your father was a Gulf War veteran, 2nd Battalion, 1st Marines, but that's not what made him a hero, was it?
No.
He wore your rags, like his father before him, whose name was also Rory.
That's a big legacy to live up to.
Mine is going to be what happened to Havenrock.
I'm gonna have to live with that every day for the rest of my life, knowing that I cannot fix it and knowing that it's not the last mistake that I'm ever going to have to make.
I still don't know if I can...
Work side by side with someone who's a reminder of what you lost.
I understand.
Just like you're a reminder of what I did, and I...
I know they're not the same thing.
We both want the same thing, to be able to live with what's happened so that we can move... forward.
It's Curtis.
I am so sorry, and we could really use you.
I...
I wish I could, Felicity.
I just...
I can't right now.
I'm sorry.
If you change your mind, well, we're here.
Cell 1138, right side, third from the left.
He's not here.
Give me a minute while I scan the feeds.
Oh, no.
What?
They moved him into gen pop.
You go in there, neither of you are getting out.
Talk to me.
When's he coming back to his cell?
Outside our window.
If those MPs wake up, the first thing they're gonna do is move John and all the other prisoners to a more secure location, and we lose our shot.
Abort.
We're blown.
Tell me where I can find Kovar.
You think you scare me more than him?
No, but he's not locked up in here with you.
I am.
You wouldn't kill me in front of all of them.
I'm not gonna lay a finger on you.
Same can't be said for Alisa.
Or maybe I'll visit your wife Maya when she's picking up Alisa from ballet.
Somebody... is gonna die.
It can be Kovar, it can be your wife, it can be your child, but I need you to choose and do it quickly.
Kovar is very paranoid, careful.
We never meet in person, only remotely.
Remotely?
How?
A digital dead drop, the Dark Web.
What's the IP address?
What is the IP address?
108.166.7.161.
If this information is incorrect, your family will suffer.
How does an American become this...
This...
Bratva devil?
I don't know.
About time, Blondie.
Can we go now?
First of all, not my name.
Second, were you able to locate Church on your recon?
No, but street cams actually picked him up, so we know he's on the move.
We just don't know where he's moving to.
We can't go after Church without knowing his endgame first.
Sounds like an excuse to sit around and do nothing.
What are you doing?
Not nothing.
You're cross-plotting.
Church's prior locations into a projection algorithm.
Hmm.
You probably got beat up in grade school a lot.
And junior high.
Ok.
Based on Church's route, I'm calculating an 86% likelihood he's going to 18 Mill Road.
Why does that sound so familiar?
Because we were just there to hand over Sergio.
That's where the ACU's bunkered.
Church is gonna take them out.
Montes, quit screwing around.
Station chief, this is Gans from cell block "C."
We have a code yellow situation.
Initiate immediate lockdown and have all prisoners return to their cells.
I'm not rolling on Church.
You think you scare me more than him?
Hmm.
No...
But he's not here with you.
I am.
Hmm.
You're not gonna put a beating on me.
You're a D.A.
Yeah.
Haven't you heard?
All of the justice in this city comes from vigilantes.
Word on the street is is that Church's planning something, something big.
You tell me what it is, and he'll be the one in those cuffs instead of you.
Heh heh heh.
You're talking about the trust.
Oh, you can't stop it, man.
Can't even... come close.
What's going on?
Church.
At least we definitely know where Church is now.
D'Angelo's right.
We got to put him down.
Against that?
Without Oliver?
No.
We're sh...
Shorthanded as it is.
You scared?
No, but I'm not stupid either.
Evie's right.
I'm not sending you guys out there just to get slaughtered.
Thanks for the vote of confidence.
You saw what you're up against, ok?
This isn't some drill where you take down a petty thug or drug dealer.
This is real, ok, with real stakes.
The 3 of you could die out there.
That's something we get to decide for ourselves, isn't it?
I mean, I don't know about everyone else, but I didn't join this team to stay safe.
Ok.
Why don't we take a vote?
All those in favor.
We're all gonna say yes, Blondie.
God.
That's not my name.
Good.
Ok.
Go.
Do not die.
Code yellow.
Return all prisoners to their cells.
Code yellow.
Return all prisoners to their cells.
Immediate code yellow enforced.
Move prisoners to their cells.
Hey, John.
What's new?
I'm not doing this.
I told Lyla.
Yeah.
You can yell at us later, but right now, we're on a bit of a clock.
Are you even hearing me right now?
I don't want anything to do with this.
The MPs are gonna do a count in a few minutes.
My guess is they're only expecting to find one person in here.
Really?
So that's your play, blackmail?
Do what you say, or you get caught in here, too?
You're my brother, John.
What happens to you happens to me.
Oliver...
I killed my brother.
I went to the army to change, and I haven't changed.
I know, all right, and I know that you think this is your penance for that.
Oliver, it's not just that.
I trusted Andy.
Even when you told me not to, I trusted him, and now Laurel's dead.
I need you, the team needs you, the city needs you.
I'm not saying you shouldn't do your penance.
You probably should, but do it as Spartan.
What's in the box?
It's an antimolecular compound, and theoretically, it should eat through anything.
Not gonna ask you how you got your hands on this.
Hey.
You came back for me, even against my wishes.
I guess I haven't changed that much either.
Maybe that's what I have to do my penance for.
That toy of yours is definitely coming in handy.
Project that Lyla's been keeping an eye on for Argus.
Should have known she'd be helping out.
Tell Johnny he can thank me later.
You've got to keep moving.
Follow the sublevel north 200 meters, then climb up.
What... what is it?
Comm's being jammed.
No, no, no.
Hey.
Is there another way out of here?
Mind uncuffing me before they kill you?
Hi.
Hey.
Hey.
If that's for taking out the wall, the blast will kill us before we can get out.
We're in too tight.
- Trust me.
- Yeah, says the creepy-looking...
What the hell are you anyways?
I'm in place.
Blow it.
Sorry we blew up your building.
Come on!
We're going up.
Then what?
Which way, Overwatch?
Take a right at the end of that hallway.
It should be a fire exit.
If you go through there, you're home free easy.
Not so easy.
Rags, cover me.
Go!
Go, go!
Unh!
Okay.
Get him up.
Come on.
I probably should just shoot you, but...
But you've earned a little suffering.
Get him to safety.
- But...
- Go!
It's ok.
Hey.
Don't kill him.
He may have his uses.
We've got to go back for Wild Dog.
Copy.
Overwatch, Mr. Terrific is hurt.
We could use some help.
Inbound.
Hold on.
Get in!
Where's the Wild Dog kid?
Still inside, fighting Church.
We've got to go back for him.
No.
Unless you all want to die, we've got to go now, now!
We can't just leave him.
You have to.
Go.
Come on!
Let's go.
- Here.
- What's this?
Just put it on.
Let's go.
Dig, your harness.
You two, freeze!
Down on the ground!
Lace your fingers behind your head!
Do it now, or we will shoot!
John, don't move.
This place should keep you off the grid for the time being.
Until we find a permanent solution.
Hey.
First things first.
Can't believe you broke me out of prison.
For better or worse, Johnny.
Told you I wanted to stay.
And I figured if you wanted to make your own decisions then you wouldn't haven't gotten married.
Ok.
How mad was Felicity that you went along with this?
How do you know she thought it was a bad idea?
I know Felicity.
What's wrong?
I have to go.
Hey.
When you said you haven't changed...
Don't.
Dobroye utro.
How was first night in Russian prison?
Friedkin gave up the dead drop, and now he's dead.
Mission accomplished.
Your being sarcasm, yes?
That man wasn't a threat, Anatoly.
He didn't deserve to die.
In Bratva, there is no death without purpose.
If Friedkin living, he is warning Kovar.
If he is warning Kovar, his information not so good.
Vy ponimayete?
Maybe you could have explained that to me before you sent me in there.
I almost didn't kill him.
But you did.
Why?
Because you told me to.
You trust us.
Now we trust you.
Third test over.
You get it?
You are Bratva now, family.
Last handful of honest cops in this city, and Church nearly took them out along with me.
We're just glad you're all right.
I've got to be thinking this is a PR nightmare, something like this going down and the mayor's MIA.
Look.
He called in this morning.
His health problems are almost over.
That's good news.
Um, we're... we're hearing that one of the, uh, vigilantes who was part of the rescue, that he didn't make it out.
Um, any word on him?
CSU hasn't found a body, so...
So Church has him.
I spent most of my life thinking that men in masks were only capable of doing horrible things.
I may have to reevaluate that.
Let me know when Queen gets in.
Will do.
Are you all right?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I mean, I barely knew the kid, Thea.
But that doesn't make it sting any less.
Well, yeah, sure it does.
The year I've had, this is... this is easy.
Yeah.
I mean, cold as that sounds.
Look.
I know why you're asking, ok, and I'm...
I'm fine.
Ok.
I mean, I'm...
I'm...
I'm just saying if things ever get less easy, you know I'm here for you, right?
Noted...
And appreciated.
Ok.
What is the point of having keyhole satellite imagery if you can't use it to find anybody?
I feel like I don't understand half the sentences you say.
What I'm saying is is that no matter how hard I try
I cannot find Rene anywhere.
And I was the one who told you guys to leave him behind.
Sounds like another impossible decision.
Does that mean I'm supposed to get better at making them?
I'm saying you were right.
If we're gonna do this, we can't let guilt swallow us up.
I'll keep you from doing it if you promise the same for me.
Deal.
Ow!
Ow!
Ow!
So "ow" then?
Things have really fallen apart without Oliver, haven't they?
It's a good thing I'm back then.
Was he waiting for an entrance line?
Nope.
He's just that cool.
I got your text.
Have we found Rene?
You get John?
Yeah.
He's fine.
He's holed up at HIVE.
I couldn't write him off, and we... are not gonna write off Rene.
We're gonna find him, we're gonna bring him back...
Wherever he is.
Ah.
Wakey, wakey.
Yow!
Yow!
Heh heh heh.
Hey.
Man, it's been a long time since I've been tagged like this.
Respect.
Oh, my pleasure, but I promise you if you untie me
I'll show you a hell of a lot more than respect.
Ooh, man, you got spirit, and I am duly impressed, but I'm gonna break that spirit.
I'm gonna break your soul, and when we're finished, assuming that you're still alive...
Now I wouldn't bet no money on that, though...
There's gonna be very little of you left for the Green Arrow to work with.
Light him up.
[Screaming]
Precisely Synchronized by srjanapala
Oliver:
My name is Oliver Queen.
After 5 years in Hell,
I returned home with only one goal-- to save my city.
Today, I fight that war on two fronts.
By day, I lead Star City as its mayor, but by night, I am someone else.
I am something else.
I am the Green Arrow.
Previously on "Arrow"...
Former police Captain Quentin Lance, who will be serving beside me as Deputy Mayor.
Appreciate the vote of confidence, Mr. Mayor.
Are you not from Star City?
No.
Havenrock.
Felicity, voice-over:
There's something that I need you to know.
Havenrock was not the intended target.
Someone redirected the missile to reduce the number of casualties.
That someone was me.
Ever since I killed Andy...
You think you need to be punished.
Stop fighting for me, Lyla.
Lyla:
We need to talk about John.
He's back in the country, and he's in prison, and I need you to break him out.
Rene:
Come on, Mr. Olympia.
Hustle up.
Mr. Olympia's a bodybuilding competition.
I was--am an Olympic athlete.
Yeah?
They give out gold medals for effort now?
Curtis:
Very funny, and it was a bronze medal.
Why is that so hard to remember?
Oliver:
Quiet.
Every time you're out in the field, you could die.
Don't forget that, don't lose focus.
Overwatch, do we have the target?
Headed toward the east exit, closing fast.
Do we know what he stole?
Not yet, but I have a feeling we're about to find out.
Only if we snag him in the cordon.
Artemis, be ready.
Does this mean I actually get to shoot someone?
I mean, not, you know, shoot someone shoot someone.
I just meant that more than--
Oliver:
We know what you meant.
You wait for him to reach the cordon, then engage.
- Do you copy?
-Copy.
Curtis:
Copy.
Rene:
Copy.
Still a lot of ground to cover.
Rag's should be here.
Oliver:
Overwatch, do you have a 20 on Ragman?
I texted him, like, 10 times and then 10 more, but Nada.
Maybe he's sick.
I mean, the flu's been going around, and by the looks of those rags, he does not hit the drycleaner very often.
[Door opens]
Hola, muchacho.
Wild Dog, that is Artemis' shot.
I got him.
[Gunshots]
What the?
I got him.
[Gunshots continue]
What did I say?
That was Artemis' shot!
Dude was getting away.
No, he wasn't.
And you missed.
You were in the Navy.
You should know better.
I was dishonorably discharged actually.
You think that I don't know that?
Deliver that and the evidence to the anti-crime unit and then go home.
What about tonight's training session?
You're taking a few days off.
Evelyn:
Nice going...again.
How are we supposed to get this buy to the ACU, call a Uber?

[Door slams]
Oliver.
The Op's over, and you've been MIA for days.
It's not acceptable.
Get it together immediately, or you're off the team.
That's why I'm here, to tell you in person.
I'm off the team.
Feels pretty quick to throw in the towel.
I thought you were just getting started.
I was, and then Felicity told me the truth about her role in Havenrock.
You didn't know she told me.
Did she also tell you that she was faced with an impossible choice?
I completely realize that.
I get it wasn't her fault, but that doesn't change the fact that every time I look at her
I see the faces of my family, of everyone I ever loved.
Felicity is a constant reminder of what I lost, and as long as that's true,
I'm sorry.
I can't be here.
What about your father?
I thought he was the reason you were doing this.
I'll have to find another way to honor him.
I'm sorry to lose you.
I'm sorry to go.
Thank you for everything.
Felicity:
Did my comms deceive me, or did you actually let the recruits take an SCPD victory lap?
It's never a victory lap.
They're rough around the edges, but they're making progress except Rory, who was waiting for me upstairs to say that he quit.
He said you spoke with him about Havenrock.
Hey.
How you holding up?
She doesn't know?
About John being in prison?
Oliver told me.
I'm so sorry.
What Lyla means-- we are gonna break him out.
Of military prison?
- Yep.
- Wait, and then what?
John is just a fugitive for the rest of his life?
Better than being punished for something he didn't do.
Lyla, I've been studying the schematics that you hooked me up with.
This would be a lot easier if we had John's cooperation.
U don't have what now?
Apparently, prison is more appealing to John than coming home to his own wife and child.
Ok.
So wait a minute.
Not only do you want to commit multiple felonies and make John a wanted man for the rest of his life, he doesn't actually want you to?
Can I speak with you for a minute?
Yeah.
Is she going to be a problem?
No, but...
I was counting on her being a help.
Maybe I should pull a few of my agents in on this.
No.
If this--if this has your fingerprints on it, then both of John Jr.'s parents will be fugitives.
There is something that might actually make this not impossible.
I just read a briefing memo on a new piece of tech, an antimolecular compound.
I was kind of hoping Felicity could help us get our hands on it.
Lyla, whatever it is, I'll handle it.
Anatoly:
Second test over.
Do not make any worse by pulling out suture.
Anatoly, if this is how the Bratva treat their new members,
I'd hate to see how they treat their enemies.
Pass third and final test, find out.
What's the test?
You keep asking about Kovar.
Our sources say this man will get you one step closer.
You have to act fast, though.
He will be arraigned in morning.
Arraigned?
- Jail.
- Yeah, but what makes you think he'll talk to me.
You trust me.
I trust you.
Look.
It's a little early for a drink, don't you think?
It's not for drinking.
Anatoly, what the hell was that for?
I should probably just start prerecording apologies for being late.
Don't worry.
Thea told us.
I'm sorry, man.
Gout is a bitch.
Yes, it is.
I'm actually gonna be taking some time off to have it taken care of.
Well, fortunately, we now have a deputy mayor to help pick up the slack.
It'll be great working with you.
You've had an impressive career, Mr. Lance?
Yeah.
I mean, a lot of people out there probably wouldn't, uh, share that opinion, but thank you.
Public service isn't easy.
Sometimes, you get a little dirty clearing out the filth.
Speaking of which, I heard there was an arrest last night that may help in our case against Tobias Church.
Sergio Espinosa, long-time Los Halcones member turned Church strongman.
The Green Arrow and his merry band of vigilantes left him gift-wrapped for us at anti-crime.
The only thing that was missing was a bow.
Well, you don't sound to happy about that.
Vigilantes are a superficial solution.
If we need their help to get our streets clean--
It means we haven't done our jobs right.
Do you think that you can get Espinosa to flip on Church?
I'll lean on him hard, see if he buckles.
Make sure he doesn't get any help from crooked cops.
Not a chance.
I'm gonna walk every piece of evidence in the custody chain through myself.
Good.
Uh, if it's all right with you,
I'll have Quentin accompany you, be my eyes and ears while I'm out of town.
Sure.
Give us a little bit of time to get acquainted.
Heh.
Great.
I'm sorry.
When did, uh, babysitting evidence become part of the job description?
Since I trust you.
You do?
I mean, all things considered?
If we didn't think you were right for the job, we wouldn't have offered it to you, right?
I haven't had a drink in a week, ok?
Where the hell are you going anyway?
Strange time for a vacation.
You should probably assume that it's not a vacation.
Should I even ask?
No.
I--I'm not gonna be gone long.
Just please make sure that no one destroys the city while I'm away.
Sure.
Ok.
Felicity:
What are you doing?
Reviewing the SCPD evidence log on what we kept from getting stolen from Kord Industries last night.
- 6,800 processor.
- So?
Exactly.
Kord manufactures bleeding-edge tech, military-grade weapons,
I mean, all kinds of city-threatening items.
Why would Church send a guy to steal a computer chip that you could buy from any Tech Village store?
Well, who cares?
Everything's on its way to lockup now.
Because knowing what Church's endgame was is like--it's like this thing that's still out there, lurking.
You all right over there?
Because I've been doing a lot of talking, and you haven't, which is very weird.
Ha!
You know how you told me to tell Rory about Havenrock?
Yeah.
Oh!
He's not sick with the flu, is he?
No.
He's just sick of working with me.
Did you try talking to him?
There's not a lot I can say that would make him feel ok about his entire family being killed.
[Computer beeps]
Incoming.
Another robbery in progress at--
Palmer Tech!
I got to call Oliver.
Or maybe don't, and we'll just let the get robbed.
It will serve Mr. Dennis right for firing us.
He fired me.
You quit.
Because he fired you.
Same thing.
[Alarm blaring]
Man on radio:
Sanchez, you got anything?
Nada.
[Cell phone rings]
What's up?
Hey.
There's been a break-in at Palmer Tech.
Are you still in the area?
Uh...
Yeah.
I can look into that.
How was Palmer Tech?
Before you answer, you should consider that your phone has GPS, and if you were thinking about lying,
I do admire your consistency.
I wasn't thinking of lying to you.
I wasn't looping you in after you made it clear you didn't approve of the decision.
John is the one who doesn't approve of the plan.
John's not thinking clearly.
Well, I bet Roy is, and if he were here,
I think he would tell you that life on the run is no life at all, and I seem to remember you not being on board with that plan.
Roy was making a bad choice just like John is making a bad choice.
He is currently locked up in a military prison for a crime he didn't commit.
To atone for a crime that he did commit, and what does it matter?
John doesn't want to leave.
It is not your choice.
Why do you always have to go and make decisions for him?
He already abandoned the team.
I am not gonna let him abandon his family.
Is that what this is about,
John leaving the team?
This is simple.
I am gonna stop John from making a decision he will come to regret.
You should consider doing the exact same thing with Rory.
You do realize that me having a chat with Rory is completely different than you committing half a dozen felonies, right?
Did you ever think you'd be doing this again, handling evidence?
No.
Didn't think I'd be deputy mayor either, but here we are.
I was surprised you took the job, to be honest.
From what I hear, you and Queen have a, uh-- a complicated history.
Got to be a lot of hatchets to bury there.
Yeah.
Well, at least I know where they're buried.
That's something you can't buy or steal.
Package is here, boss.
D.A., Deputy Mayor, too.
Ah.
Bonus.
Get ready to move.
[Tires squeal]
Let me guess.
Felicity filled you in.
That you're gonna break into a military prison?
Yeah, and you got the nerve to call me Wild Dog?
I'm done debating this.
Evelyn:
Really?
Because this is the first we've heard of it.
I thought we were your team.
Running off to bust someone out of prison sounds like team business, and what happens to us when you get caught?
You've made it clear that we can't do this vigilante thing without you.
When I get caught?
I'm not gonna get caught.
Curtis:
Right because we're not gonna let you do this.
I'm sorry.
Did you say that you're not gonna let me?
Yes.
I need to see you physically deposit the item.
I've been on this job 15 years.
I've never lost a piece of evidence.
Now relax, Sergeant.
No one's doubting your proficiency here, ok?
Seems like.
[Whistling]
This is it.
You gonna let me do my job now?
Have at it.
[Case humming]
- What the hell?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Get out of here!
[Alarm blaring]
Church:
Whoo!
Find the weapons, boys.
Ahh.
Sorry, gents.
Load them up!
And burn this puppy down.
Church:
Let's go, let's go!
Ok.
Last chance.
Get off the street.
I didn't think he'd actually hit you guys.
Rene:
You know what really sucks?
Curtis:
Realizing that in all those training sessions where he was kicking our respective asses the whole time he was taking it easy on us.
Evelyn:
Yeah.
Remind me to never, ever get on his bad side.
Curtis:
I think that would imply that he has a good side, and, you know, Felicity, could you please explain to me again how you thought this was all gonna go down?
Well, I thought if he saw you guys all united against his crazy plan he'd reconsider.
Right because Oliver Queen is known for thinking things through and taking input from others.
Right.
Wow.
The ever-expanding club house.
And who are you?
I'm Thea, Oliver's Chief of Staff.
And also his sister.
Don't tell me Oliver beat you up, too?
Heh.
Ollie did this?
Object lesson, long story.
It's fine.
Don't ask.
What happened to you?
Tobias Church happened.
That evidence that you guys recovered from Kord Industries-- modified to go boom.
He wanted it to be put into lockup.
And he wanted to raid it.
One-stop shopping for weapons.
Including those RPGs that he took from Amertek if this report's right.
We got to find out what he's planning to do with those weapons-- because it ain't nothing good.
This is a really bad time for Oliver to be out of town.
Yeah.
I just tried him.
He's gone dark.
Why don't you guys hit the streets?
We want to figure out what Church is up to before it's too late.
- You sure?
- Mm-hmm.
I don't think Oliver would want us out there without him.
Right.
Well, Oliver forfeited his opinion when he left.
Ok, but this is an all hands on deck situation, rag-covered hands included.
Just saying.
Where's Private Jesseman?
This is usually his delivery.
Flu's been tearing through the base, sir.
I drew the short straw.
I don't see you on the list.
Your C.O. should have submitted a change of personnel form.
You sure he didn't?
It's an hour's drive back to the base.
Can't you refresh your Wi-Fi or something?
There you are.
As you were, Private.
Thank you, sir.
[Beep]
I'm in.
25 minutes till extraction.
Roger that.
Facilities cameras are on a closed network.
If you can give me access to the mainframe, I can open it up.
- I'm on my way.
- Oliver...
If you don't make it to the extraction point--
I'll make it, and I won't be alone.
Ahem.
Ohh.
Ahh.
Hey.
You speak English?
Yes.
Your accent-- you are American.
Yeah, maybe once upon a time, but, uh, now I'm more just enjoying everything that Russia has to offer.
Yes.
I can smell that.
You judge me?
You're in this cell, too.
Yes.
A mistake my boss will correct very soon.
You mean Konstantin Kovar?
How do you know that name?
Oh, same way that I know your name's Pyotr Friedkin, same way I know that you launder money for Kovar, same way that I know that's what you're doing here.
How can you know that unless...
Are you Bratva?
[Gags]
[Coughing]
He's fine.
Mmm.
I am Bratva, and you are gonna tell me everything that I want to know.
Your turn to run system check.
I'm gonna hit the head.
Don't touch my ball.
[Beep]
[Beep]
Dude, what the hell?
Transponder's in place.
Roger that.
I've got eyes now.
I'll walk you to Johnny's cell.
Hey!
Hey.
Is this--uh, is this a bad time?
Do I want to even ask how you found me?
Heh.
I feel like that's a trick question.
Sorry about the mess.
Wow!
These are amazing.
You spend enough time with other people's castoffs, you find ways to make something useful out of them.
My father always used to say that.
He owned a pawn shop.
On Southmoor Road, right?
How'd you know?
Last week, you told Oliver that you had joined the team to honor your father.
When you quit...
I wanted to find out more about what you were giving up.
Your father was a Gulf War veteran, 2nd Battalion, 1st Marines, but that's not what made him a hero, was it?
No.
He wore your rags, his father before him, whose name was also Rory.
That's a big legacy to live up to.
Mine is going to be what happened to Havenrock.
I'm gonna have to live with that every day for the rest of my life, knowing that I cannot fix it and knowing that it's not the last mistake that I'm ever going to have to make.
I still don't know if I can--
Work side by side with someone who's a reminder of what you lost.
I understand.
Just like you're a reminder of what I did, and I--I know they're not the same thing.
We both want the same thing, to be able to live with what's happened so that we can move forward.
[Cell phone vibrating]
It's Curtis.
I am so sorry, and we could really use you.
I--I wish I could, Felicity.
I just...
I can't right now.
I'm sorry.
If you change your mind, well, we're here.
Lyla:
Cell 1138, right side, third from the left.
He's not here.
Give me a minute while I scan the feeds.
Oh, no.
What?
They moved him into gen pop.
You go in there, neither of you are getting out.
Talk to me.
When's he coming back to his cell?
Outside our window.
If those MPs wake up, the first thing they're gonna do is move John and all the other prisoners to a more secure location, and we lose our shot.
Abort.
We're blown.
Tell me where I can find Kovar.
You think you scare me more than him?
No, but he's not locked up in here with you.
I am.
You wouldn't kill me in front of all of them.
I'm not gonna lay a finger on you.
Same can't be said for Alisa.
Or maybe I'll visit your wife Maya when she's picking up Alisa from ballet.
Somebody is gonna die.
It can be Kovar, it can be your wife, it can be your child, but I need you to choose and do it quickly.
Kovar is very paranoid, careful.
We never meet in person, only remotely.
Remotely?
How?
A digital dead drop, the Dark Web.
What's the IP address?
What is the IP address?
108.166.7.161.
If this information is incorrect, your family will suffer.
How does an American become this...
This...
Bratva devil?
I don't know.
[Bones crack]
About time, Blondie.
Can we go now?
First of all, not my name.
Second, were you able to locate Church on your recon?
No, but street cams actually picked him up, so we know he's on the move.
We just don't know where he's moving to.
We can't go after Church without knowing his endgame first.
Sounds like an excuse to sit around and do nothing.
What are you doing?
Not nothing.
Curtis:
You're cross-plotting
Church's prior locations into a projection algorithm.
Hmm.
You probably got beat up in grade school a lot.
And junior high.
Ok.
Based on Church's route, I'm calculating an 86% likelihood he's going to 18 Mill Road.
Why does that sound so familiar?
Because we were just there to hand over Sergio.
That's where the ACU's bunkered.
Church is gonna take them out.
Montes, quit screwing around.
Station chief, this is Gans from cell block "C."
We have a code yellow situation.
Initiate immediate lockdown and have all prisoners return to their cells.
I'm not rolling on Church.
You think you scare me more than him?
Hmm.
No...
But he's not here with you.
I am.
Hmm.
You're not gonna put a beating on me.
You're a D.A.
Yeah.
Haven't you heard?
All of the justice in this city comes from vigilantes.
Word on the street is is that Church's planning something, something big.
You tell me what it is, and he'll be the one in those cuffs instead of you.
Heh heh heh.
You're talking about the trust.
Oh, you can't stop it, man.
Can't even come close.
What's going on?
[Machineguns firing]
Church.
At least we definitely know where Church is now.
D'Angelo's right.
We got to put him down.
Evelyn:
Against that?
Without Oliver?
No.
We're sh-- shorthanded as it is.
You scared?
No, but I'm not stupid either.
Evie's right.
I'm not sending you guys out there just to get slaughtered.
Thanks for the vote of confidence.
You saw what you're up against, ok?
This isn't some drill where you take down a petty thug or drug dealer.
This is real, ok, with real stakes.
The 3 of you could die out there.
Rory:
That's something we get to decide for ourselves, isn't it?
I mean, I don't know about everyone else, but I didn't join this team to stay safe.
Ok.
Why don't we take a vote?
All those in favor.
Rene:
We're all gonna say yes, Blondie.
God.
That's not my name.
Good.
Ok.
Go.
Do not die.
Man on P.A.:
Code yellow.
Return all prisoners to their cells.
Code yellow.
Return all prisoners to their cells.
Immediate code yellow enforced.
Move prisoners to their cells.
[Alarm blaring]
Hey, John.
What's new?
I'm not doing this.
I told Lyla.
Yeah.
You can yell at us later, but right now, we're on a bit of a clock.
Are you even hearing me right now?
I don't want anything to do with this.
The MPs are gonna do a count in a few minutes.
My guess is they're only expecting to find one person in here.
Really?
So that's your play, blackmail?
Do what you say, or you get caught in here, too?
You're my brother, John.
What happens to you happens to me.
Oliver...
I killed my brother.
I went to the army to change, and I haven't changed.
I know, all right, and I know that you think this is your penance for that.
Oliver, it's not just that.
I trusted Andy.
Even when you told me not to, I trusted him, and now Laurel's dead.
I need you, the team needs you, the city needs you.
I'm not saying you shouldn't do your penance.
You probably should, but do it as Spartan.
What's in the box?
It's an antimolecular compound, and theoretically, it should eat through anything.
Not gonna ask you how you got your hands on this.
Hey.
You came back for me, even against my wishes.
I guess I haven't changed that much either.
Maybe that's what I have to do my penance for.
That toy of yours is definitely coming in handy.
Project that Lyla's been keeping an eye on for Argus.
Should have known she'd be helping out.
Tell Johnny he can thank me later.
You've got to keep moving.
Follow the sublevel north 200 meters, then climb up.
[Static]
What--what is it?
Comm's being jammed.
[Alarm blaring]
Adrian:
No, no, no.
Hey.
Is there another way out of here?
Mind uncuffing me before they kill you?
Rory:
Hi.
Adrian:
Hey.
Hey.
If that's for taking out the wall, the blast will kill us before we can get out.
We're in too tight.
- Trust me.
- Yeah, says the creepy-looking--
What the hell are you anyways?
I'm in place.
Blow it.
Sorry we blew up your building.
Come on!
We're going up.
Then what?
[Gunshots]
Which way, Overwatch?
Take a right at the end of that hallway.
It should be a fire exit.
If you go through there, you're home free easy.
Not so easy.
Rags, cover me.
Go!
Go, go!
Unh!
Get him up.
Come on.
[Groans]
I probably should just shoot you, but...
But you've earned a little suffering.
Get him to safety.
- But--
- Go!
It's ok.
Hey.
Don't kill him.
He may have his uses.
We've got to go back for Wild Dog.
Copy.
Overwatch, Mr. Terrific is hurt.
We could use some help.
Inbound.
Hold on.
Get in!
Where's the Wild Dog kid?
Still inside, fighting Church.
We've got to go back for him.
No.
Unless you all want to die, we've got to go now, now!
We can't just leave him.
You have to.
Go.
Come on!
Let's go.
- Here.
- What's this?
Just put it on.
Let's go.
Dig, your harness.
You two, freeze!
Down on the ground!
Lace your fingers behind your head!
Do it now, or we will shoot!
John, don't move.
This place should keep you off the grid for the time being.
Until we find a permanent solution.
Hey.
First things first.
Can't believe you broke me out of prison.
For better or worse, Johnny.
Told you I wanted to stay.
And I figured if you wanted to make your own decisions then you wouldn't haven't gotten married.
Ok.
How mad was Felicity that you went along with this?
How do you know she thought it was a bad idea?
I know Felicity.
[Cell phone vibrating]
What's wrong?
I have to go.
Hey.
When you said you haven't changed...
Don't.
Dobroye utro.
How was first night in Russian prison?
Friedkin gave up the dead drop, and now he's dead.
Mission accomplished.
Your being sarcasm, yes?
That man wasn't a threat, Anatoly.
He didn't deserve to die.
In Bratva, there is no death without purpose.
If Friedkin living, he is warning Kovar.
If he is warning Kovar, his information not so good.
Vy ponimayete?
Maybe you could have explained that to me before you sent me in there.
I almost didn't kill him.
But you did.
Why?
Because you told me to.
You trust us.
Now we trust you.
Third test over.
You get it?
You are Bratva now, family.
Last handful of honest cops in this city, and Church nearly took them out along with me.
We're just glad you're all right.
I've got to be thinking this is a PR nightmare, something like this going down and the mayor's MIA.
Look.
He called in this morning.
His health problems are almost over.
That's good news.
Um, we're--we're hearing that one of the, uh, vigilantes who was part of the rescue, that he didn't make it out.
Um, any word on him?
CSU hasn't found a body, so...
So Church has him.
I spent most of my life thinking that men in masks were only capable of doing horrible things.
I may have to reevaluate that.
Let me know when Queen gets in.
Will do.
Are you all right?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I mean, I barely knew the kid, Thea.
But that doesn't make it sting any less.
Well, yeah, sure it does.
The year I've had, this is--this is easy.
Yeah.
I mean, cold as that sounds.
Look.
I know why you're asking, ok, and I'm--I'm fine.
Ok.
I mean, I'm--I'm-- I'm just saying if things ever get less easy, you know I'm here for you, right?
Noted...
And appreciated.
Ok.
What is the point of having keyhole satellite imagery if you can't use it to find anybody?
I feel like I don't understand half the sentences you say.
What I'm saying is is that no matter how hard I try
I cannot find Rene anywhere.
And I was the one who told you guys to leave him behind.
Sounds like another impossible decision.
Does that mean I'm supposed to get better at making them?
I'm saying you were right.
If we're gonna do this, we can't let guilt swallow us up.
I'll keep you from doing it if you promise the same for me.
Deal.
Curtis:
Ow!
Ow!
Ow!
Evelyn:
So "ow" then?
Things have really fallen apart without Oliver, haven't they?
It's a good thing I'm back then.
Was he waiting for an entrance line?
Nope.
He's just that cool.
I got your text.
Have we found Rene?
You get John?
Yeah.
He's fine.
He's holed up at HIVE.
I couldn't write him off, and we are not gonna write off Rene.
We're gonna find him, we're gonna bring him back...
Wherever he is.
Church:
Ah.
Wakey, wakey.
Yow!
Yow!
Heh heh heh.
Hey.
Man, it's been a long time since I've been tagged like this.
Respect.
Oh, my pleasure, but I promise you if you untie me
I'll show you a hell of a lot more than respect.
Ooh, man, you got spirit, and I am duly impressed, but I'm gonna break that spirit.
I'm gonna break your soul, and when we're finished, assuming that you're still alive-- now I wouldn't bet no money on that, though-- there's gonna be very little of you left
for the Green Arrow to work with.
Light him up.

No!
The tooth fairy is my white whale, and you are gonna deliver him to me, chef.
Our dream was to open a restaurant right here.
I told you, I'm not doing a restaurant without Rie.
Wake up.
This isn't about you.
This is about your son.
No, we're broke.
Where would we even get the money?
The real money is in filling that need even when it don't need filling.
So, it could be a robot with wheels on it.
And it could go, like, anywhere in the house.
And how does it get around the house?
- There's a remote.
- Genius.
I'm calling Starbucks right away.
I'm serious.
We can make, like, a million dollars.
If we...
- You have something there.
- What?
Teej, you ready?
Had breakfast?
Well, it doesn't matter.
W-We got to go.
Come on.
Backpack.
Hey, yo, Tommy.
Come on, bud.
Come on.
W-Wait!
You're gonna talk to your dad this morning, right?
- Late for school!
- About investing!
Tommy, investing!
How many cases can I put you down for for this remarkable Pinot grigio?
I still have a couple of cases.
I got what I need.
I'm good.
Really?
'Cause a couple of days ago, if memory serves, um, you were...
You were into my Sonoma Chard.
Actually, I only bought four cases.
It was a Merlot.
So I'm good.
What if he don't come out?
He will, and it's "doesn't."
Gentleman.
So... the restaurant...?
Is moving forward.
I just lined up an investor.
In a week you'll have a signed contract in your hands.
I'll need to see this alleged contact from this alleged investor in 48 hours.
C-Come on, man... 48 hours?
That's a little tight, don't you think?
You still have nine fingers, Dion, and all those pretty teeth.
Hello?
- Is this Tommy?
- Yeah.
Who is this?
This is Pilar from grief group.
I mean, from many places, but, in your case, you mostly know me from grief group.
Yeah.
Right.
Yeah.
Uh, hey, Pilar.
Hi, Tommy.
Uh, listen.
Um, I'm sorry to bother you, and I'll be quick.
Uh, remember how I said my sister has this restaurant?
Well, we both kind of have it.
Anyways, um, you know, we're always looking for wines that are, you know, unique.
Unique's good.
So, I-I was wondering if maybe you could recommend some unique wines?
Yeah, okay.
I'll...
I'll come up with some ideas for the next meeting.
Or I could stop by?
I mean, to your place?
Ah... honestly my place is kind of a mess.
I'm at the old Kramer Piano Factory and we're kind of in the middle of renovations.
It's really more...
Uh...
Pilar, sorry.
I'm, uh, I'm getting another call from my boss.
Okay.
Bye.
Uh, someone's in here.
Are you the kid who doesn't talk?
Dumb question.
Your mom got killed, huh?
Are you gonna at least tell me your name?
Dude!
Cool.
You can keep the marker.
Bye.
Frank.
Frank!
Hey.
What's with the cryptic phone call?
Am I getting a promotion?
Walk with me.
Tommy, you got a nose for wines like nobody else.
Okay.
But your nose for selling wines...
Come on, Frank.
No one can sell in the territories you got me in.
It's not about the territories, Tommy.
It is about the salesman.
Now I am getting complaints.
You're mixing up your wines.
You're not following through.
You're backing into a construction barrier?
But that I mean, the thing jumped out at me.
I swear.
Okay.
So, what?
W-Where's this going?
If this keeps up, I'm gonna have to let you go.
You know what, let me save you the trouble.
All right?
I've had enough.
Of?
This!
Selling wine in bulk to people who don't know a goddamn Syrah from a Sauterne.
I don't need this.
You know, a friend and I...
We're opening up a restaurant in Morrisania, and it's gonna kill.
You're opening a restaurant in the Bronx?
Yeah.
That's right.
Okay.
Well, once you quit, you can't un-quit.
You got that?
Yeah.
So?
So what'd he say?
Who?
Your dad, that's who.
Come on, is he in?
Ah, look, I've had a crappy morning, all right?
I'll ask him some other time.
H-Hey!
What are you doing?
Look, I'm not waiting around for you to grow a pair.
Best way to deal with cold water, bro...
Jump right in.
Hmm?
Come on, I'll come with as backup.
Get in the car.
Oh, that's... that's funny.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Look.
I'm just playing around.
Just get in.
Whoa!
Look, the car's got a mind of its own, man.
I can't stop it!
I swear to God, you move one more time...
I...
Come on, get in.
Ooh, no.
- I missed you.
- I missed you, too.
No.
I've really missed you.
How old are we?
Word in the walls is the Asians are expecting a boat-load of merch.
I hadn't heard that.
Must be hard to get solid info with all the limitations of total freedom.
Those Hmong are getting big-balled, moving in on us.
Don't worry.
Dad, I sent them a very clear message.
That merch will still land.
What have you done about the Greek who burned down our restaurant?
All over it.
He owes us 600 grand.
Can't get money out of a dead man.
No.
But you can send a message that actually means something.
You're giving him this opportunity, remember that.
All right?
You are a rock star sommelier who I've seen sell a $500 bottle of wine to a table full of bridge and tunnel cretins.
I mean, you got this.
Would you relax?
Come on, you're making me nervous.
Just loosen up.
Loosen up.
That's it.
That's it.
That's it.
Loosen up.
You haven't aged well.
Yeah, well, losing a wife can do that to you.
I got meetings up the ass.
What's this offer?
Well, um...
Dion and I have...
Well, actually it was Dion, Rie, and me...
We, uh, we've always wanted our own place, a restaurant.
We'd name it, um, Thirio.
Yeah, um, it means, um...
It means "beast."
- It means "beast."
- Right.
And we, uh, just wanted to off...
Offer, uh...
I mean, we need someone...
Yeah, you know what?
Do you mind if I...
Please.
Your friend here's about to wet himself.
Mr. Moran, you're a brilliant businessman.
Years ago, you...
You saw there was a ton of money to be made in scaffolding.
Well, we're offering you the opportunity to look at it again, to recognize that the Bronx is New York's last frontier, ready for prospectors to dive right in and strike gold.
How?
What's the one thing everyone says the Bronx doesn't have?
White people.
Right.
White people, and, uh, and restaurants.
And the first guy puts his money into a high-end place with great food and a kickass wine list, now that guy...
That guy is gonna retire on his own private island.
You know what I mean?
What kind of food we talkin'?
Basically Ot-Hellenic.
The hell is that?
Yeah.
You know what?
It's a fair question.
It's a fair question.
So why don't we do a tasting?
You come by tonight, and we'll prepare some samples of the food and wine that we have in mind.
6:00.
All right.
All right.
Plat de veau.
That's French.
We're doing Greek.
I'll do it Greek!
Grilled kebabs with lemon and sage.
No.
No sweetbreads, all right?
I do Châteauneuf with sweetbreads, and all I've got is some '08 on its last legs.
All right.
All right.
All right.
Quail... with roasted grapes, herb-crusted rack of lamb with caramelized fennel, finished with a red wine reduction.
Keep it simple, okay?
It's my dad for Christ's sakes.
He's got to taste the food under the fancy.
All right, fine!
We'll do a simple, freaking seared scallop then... with skordalia and parsley oil.
Okay.
Yeah.
- Yeah?
- Yes!
I've been dying to see how the new Assyrtiko from Santorini pairs with seafood.
I mean, that...
That could really work.
Right.
Right.
Dessert.
Dessert...
A panna cotta with figs, apricot, with a honeycomb candy.
If I pair a Sauterne with that, my dad's mouth will explode.
Yes!
Which wouldn't be the worst thing.
Yeah.
There he is.
There's my Tommy-boy.
Yes!
Hi.
I'm sorry to just...
I was in the neighborhood, and suddenly I said,
"Oh.
This is where Tommy lives."
So, I...
I hope I'm not interrupting.
No.
No, not at all.
Dion, this is Pilar.
Hey, how you doing?
We're in a...
A grief group together.
Nice that you have that in common.
So, I was wondering about those, um, wine ideas.
Oh, right.
Yeah.
Of course.
Yeah, I just got to, um...
Oh, wait, no.
Sorry.
Shoot.
I...
I got to go pick up my son from school.
- So, I...
- Tommy, are you kidding me?
Come on, dude.
Chill.
Stay here.
I'll go pick him up.
No.
What are you talking about?
Y-Yeah, yeah.
No, no.
I'll go get him.
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'll go!
Dion.
Oh!
Right.
And I'll get my jacket.
Thanks.
So... you're, uh, renovating?
Well, we're, uh, we're getting ready to.
We're turning this place into a restaurant.
A restaurant?
Here?
Yes.
Here in the Bronx.
Wow.
That's so... valiente.
Thank you.
What's the haps, T.J.?
Put it there, man.
Look, your dad's kind of busy, so I'm gonna be your Uber.
Okay?
All right, come on, get in the car.
Uh, uh, excuse me.
Sir, hi.
Um, I'm T.J.'s school counselor.
I don't remember anyone but his dad being authorized to pick him up.
I'm Dion Patras.
Tommy brought me on as T.J.'s... support person.
S-Support person?
I'm here to try and help the boy through all of this.
I'll be his ride, help him with his homework, give him someone to...
To hang with while his dad's spiraling.
Well, at least Tommy's reaching out for some help, right?
- Mm.
- Thank you.
Oh, thank you.
Thank you.
Hey, you know that kid?
I got to make a few stops, uh, before we head home, okay, champ?
What, you got something wrong with your side?
Let me take a look at that.
Aw, Jesus, T.J. Someone hit you?
Purple hat do that to you?
God damn it.
Are you sure you want to handle this yourself?
All right.
Good man.
I told you those five-inch heels will mess you up.
You were supposed to be in Paris.
What the hell happened?
I got no family there.
You're not going to want to hang out here.
Tooth Fairy is upstairs.
Tasha?
Could you get my buddy T.J. here some snacks?
Come on, T.J.
I worked out an arrangement with the Tooth Fairy.
I just got to get some more cash.
Tommy and I are doing a tasting.
I-I got to get some more ingredients.
I'm bored already.
Give me a hand.
What do you think you're doing?
You walking out on me?
Get the hell back in there.
I paid for this!
Wait outside.
You got your money, bitch.
What the hell does it matter?
What is going on?
Touch her again, asshole, and your brains are in Yankee Stadium!
I want you and your boy out of my place.
I think two dignified men can do better than to have a throwdown in a musty old whorehouse.
Gave you a little extra to cover future dental work.
Billy.
I don't know what arrangement you have with that Tooth Fairy Polak, but be careful, huh?
You're all I got.
You got it.
Thanks.
Oh, Teej, come here.
Come here.
Smell this.
Let's pick a good one.
All right, smell that.
Ah, Mrs. Chung.
Look at this.
I like the look of these diver scallops.
You know what, you can lay about half a dozen on for me, okay?
I'll be back to pick them up.
Come on, you.
Hey, Eduardo.
Dion.
What's up, brother?
Good, man.
Listen, I need a four-pound rack of upstate New York lamb.
And you...
You got any spice?
- That's it?
- That's all I got.
My dealer says the Asians are waiting on a huge shipment.
Coming in any day.
All right.
Let's talk lamb.
I got to get cooking.
Teej, come on.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold on, Chef.
The secret to cutting a zucchini, you got to cut it in half to keep it steady, okay?
You don't want to lose a finger.
All right.
All right.
Moderate-plus tannins.
Moderate-plus to high acidity.
Moderate-plus alcohol.
High complexity with a long finish.
Definitely Old World.
Okay, babe.
Keep going.
I'm gonna say Italy, probably Tuscany.
Brunello Di Montalcino.
- Right, so?
- Bring it home.
Bring it home.
That's it, come on.
Come on, T, you got this.
I say vintage... 2007.
- Gooooooal!
- Yes!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh, my man!
My man!
You're the best!
Not bad, not bad.
Come here, come here.
You hear that?
That sizzle sound?
Hmm?
That's the pan talking to me.
Now, remember, a good chef always listens to his pan.
It'll tell me when the filet's ready to be turned or the chop is gonna hit medium-rare.
It's a... a listening thing.
You got that?
All right, good man.
Oh, there he is.
Mr. Thomas Moran, sommelier extraordinaire.
You look good, man.
Great idea.
Oh, let's, uh...
Let's have a toast.
Bringing good luck to this very special, very important thing.
Are we doing this or not?
Oh, shit, he's early.
Who do I got to screw to get a meal around here?
Mr. Moran.
T.J., this is your grandfather.
Aidan, this is Thomas Jr.
So, feed me.
All right.
We're good.
Go.
The 2012 Premier Cru Chablis.
Hints of oyster shell and mineral.
Beautifully suited to be paired...
Just pour.
Abalone.
- Scallop.
- Same difference.
Well, actually, you'll find...
Next course, Chef.
For this, we recommend an earth-driven and light-bodied Pinot noir from Vosne-Romanée.
The hell is this, pigeon?
That is a sous vide quail with roasted grapes and a cracked wheat salad.
For all I know, it's a bird you found up in your attic.
- Yeah, well, with all due respect...
- Chef.
Main course, please.
Right.
Rack of lamb with roasted eggplant and a kalamata tapenade.
As for pairing, I suggest a traditional 2001 Gran Reserva Rioja.
Delicious.
The food under the fancy.
And to go with your dessert, a 2005 Sauternes.
Honey-dipped tropical fruits with notes of vanilla bean.
So, what do you think?
I don't go for this candy-ass crap.
You have no clue what an incredible meal you just had.
What Dion's cooking...
You're right.
The Bronx is going to gentrify and get busy real soon, and all those brave souls are gonna need to be fed.
May as well eat at your fancy restaurant... which I'd own half of.
With one condition.
I get to see my grandson every week.
What?
No.
No.
Uh, no, absolutely not.
Can we just discuss this privately, partner?
- No.
No.
There's nothing to...
- Yeah, in the kitchen, now.
No way.
It's not happening.
Come on, he's the kid's grandfather.
He's also a racist prick who's never even bothered to see his own grandchild, who, by the way, is black.
What?
I think he's saying he wants to do it.
He doesn't understand.
Maybe your old man has changed.
Huh?
I mean, maybe... maybe this is his way of reaching out.
All right, we have a deal.
We'll send over a contract tomorrow.
Already done.
Nice, yeah.
It's, uh, efficient.
Yeah, we're gonna give this a once-over.
We'll send you a signed copy in the morning.
Hey, and thank you!
We got ourselves a restaurant.
Living the dream, baby!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
My dad didn't get rich by playing fair, all right?
We got to get someone to look that over.
What do you mean?
Like...
Like a lawyer?
It's what you do.
All right.
I got someone.
We are so doing this!
What are you doing here?
What?
What, now that I'm out of prison,
I can't have contact with you?
Are you a known felon?
I have company.
There's, uh, there's something I need to talk to you about.
Which is?
I need, uh...
I need legal advice.
Look, we're about to open up this restaurant, and the investor's given us this massive contract.
Look, is there any chance you could eyeball it just to, I don't know, let us know if...
I don't know, if it looks okay?
You're just out of prison.
You're broke.
I don't work pro Bono.
So, no, there is no chance.
Good night.
Marisa, you coming?
Okay, Dad.
Your mom slaves all afternoon over her ziti and you're letting it get cold.
Come on.
Can't you just give it a shot?
What happened to your person?
My person?
My person was busy.
She had company.
I don't know.
Anyway, besides, it's your turn.
Can't you just call your little pretty friend?
Pilar manages her sister's restaurant.
She doesn't have time to pore over every detail of that contract.
Yeah, dude, she does.
Tommy, come on.
Why don't you...
She was in the neighborhood?
No, no, no.
People come to this neighborhood come to score drugs.
And that Pilar chick, she wants your skinny ass.
Besides, man, don't you think it's time to, you know, open your mind to the possibility of meeting a woman.
Pilar, hi.
This is Tommy.
From, uh... the wine guy.
Sorry to bother you.
You're probably super busy.
Kind of, but I can take a break.
Great.
Um, well, you remember, um...
You remember how I-I told you that Dion and I were...
Were, uh, opening a restaurant?
Yeah.
And, uh, good for you.
Yeah, but the thing is the investor has just dumped this contract on us, right?
And, well, you know, Dion knows food and I know wine, but neither of us knows a damn thing about the legal part of it all.
Uh-huh.
So, I was wondering if maybe you...
You might have some time to kind of look it over.
You know, tell us...
Tell us if it seems okay?
I'll look at your contract, yeah.
Great.
Um
Uh, do, um, you want to text me your e-mail?
Thank you so much.
No, thank you.
I mean, see you later.
Okay, bye.
Sure you want to do this?
'Cause I can tell him you changed your mind, you know?
You got...
You got too much homework, or...
Exactly why does this guy think you might be able to help him with this?
Quién sabe.
I mean, he's starting up a restaurant.
- Mm-hmm.
- I told him I work at one.
Mm-hmm.
So, I guess he just thinks I'm smart.
It's possible.
You are smart, mamita.
You're just scattered.
Look, I don't have time for this, but at a glance,
I mean, there are some things in here that'll come back to bite the ass of whoever signs it.
I sure wouldn't.
All right.
You'll never guessed what happened.
It's a funny story.
We ran into my dad.
Yeah.
Me and T.J.
You know, a total accident, but there he was, and I sort of had to introduce them.
Believe it or not, they...
They hit it off.
T.J. said he'd like to spend some time with him, and my dad didn't seem to mind, so I guess it's like you always said.
Even a crusty old racist like my father can't resist that boy's beautiful face.
You were right.
Again.
You play chess?
Your father never taught you?
You got to pee?
The bathroom's through the kitchen.
Hello?
Tommy?
Hola.
Oh, hi.
I was looking for...
How are you?
I'm good.
You know, Tommy's...
Tommy's not here.
Okay.
Um, I'll...
Wait, wait, wait, is that...
Is that the contract?
How's it look?
I mean, we all good?
Well, actually, there's some issues with it.
Like what?
Give me an example.
Well, like, it doesn't specifically say the name of the restaurant, and the location is kind of unclear.
No contract is perfect, all right?
You know, and a lot of these issues, they, uh...
They go away over time.
I just think Tommy should be aware that it's, uh, not a good contract, and you guys shouldn't sign it.
Look, I get the distinct impression that you like Tommy.
If so, then you probably give a shit about what's good for him.
Guy lost his wife.
Now his kid's a mute.
The guy's life's been in a nose dive for, like, a year.
These past few days,
I've been seeing signs of the old Tommy.
I mean, this whole restaurant idea's really got his...
His blood pumping again, which is a good thing.
If you want to bring all that crashing down, send him back into his damn rut, crush his dream... that's entirely on you.
I just think he should know.
What are you doing in here?
I didn't say you could wander around.
Get in the kitchen.
Jensen made you a sandwich.
But it's still the same.
Truck backfires, a loud clang at a construction site, and my mind, it goes back there to the boys who didn't make it out.
To my friends.
Thank you, Mose.
Good.
Uh, anybody... anybody else?
Anybody else want to share?
Tommy, how about you?
Uh...
Okay.
I mean, I guess everything's pretty much the same.
Mm-hmm.
Actually, not really.
Just felt weird not to start off that way.
Lately there's been a lot of things thrown at me.
Changes.
Um, and it's made me feel...
Well, that's just it.
It...
It's made me feel.
You know, the last few days, I haven't woken up depressed.
It's like I'm just starting to shake off this... this fog.
I think my son sees that.
It's important to me that...
That when he looks at me, he doesn't see zombie dad.
You know, he sees...
He sees his father.
I'm really happy for you.
Sounds like you're optimistic.
Well, optimistic adjacent.
Hey, did you, uh, did you read the contract?
I did.
What'd you think?
Hello.
God!
Phew!
Well?
Dude, the contract?
Pilar says we're good.
I would kiss you on the mouth if it wouldn't start rumors.
Where you going?
Don't you want to celebrate?
Just got to make a copy.
It's what you do.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
One thing I hate...
Waiting.
Cable guy, UPS, mailman, you.
I can't just go to the Tooth Fairy and get him to tell me all the bad things he's ever done.
It doesn't work like that.
One or two would do.
I have something that might interest you, though.
The Asians?
Getting a huge shipment of blow coming in any day.
God!
I don't give a rat's ass about the Asians.
I want that fat Polak.
Ahab, remember?
Huh?
The white whale, remember?
Get out of my car.
Hey, buddy.
How's it going?
Why don't you head upstairs, get ready for bed, yeah?
I'll be up in a minute.
You're late.
You don't discipline the boy.
What?
What do you mean?
You might want to teach him some rules.
Does things without asking.
Free thinker like his mother.
Never say anything about my wife.
Hey, Teej, you left your math book on the...
What's that?
Hey, what is that?
Hey.
Where'd you get those bruises?
It's really important you tell me where you got those bruises.
Did that happen today?
Okay, get in bed.
Do your homework.
Do not leave this room.
You son of a bitch.
You hit my kid?
Suppose I did.
What would you do about it?
You are not doing that to him, too, you mother...
I'd blow your brains out, but this is a $30,000 Persian rug.
We're done with him!
I don't want anything to do with that scum-sucking son of a bitch or his goddamn dirty money!
I don't care if we don't do the restaurant, all right?
!
We are not doing business with my father!
Okay.
I hear you.
Something wrong?
Nope.
All good.
[mid-tempo music plays]
[sizzling]
So, it could be a robot with wheels on it.
And it could go, like, anywhere in the house.
And how does it get around the house?
- There's a remote.
- Genius.
I'm calling Starbucks right away.
I'm serious.
We can make, like, a million dollars.
If we--
[laughs]
- You have something there.
- What?
[Tommy] Teej, you ready?
Had breakfast?
Well, it doesn't matter.
W-
- We got to go.
Come on.
Backpack.
Hey, yo, Tommy.
Come on, bud.
Come on.
W-
- Wait!
You're gonna talk to your dad this morning, right?
- [Tommy] Late for school!
- [Dion] About investing!
Tommy, investing!
[door closes]
[engine starts]
How many cases can I put you down for, for this remarkable pinot grigio?
I still have a couple of cases.
I got what I need.
I'm good.
Really?
'Cause a couple of clays ago, if memory serves, um, you were-- you were into my Sonoma Chard.
Actually, I only bought four cases.
It was a Merlot.
[buyer] $0 I'm good.
[banjo music plays]
[horns honking, siren wailing]
[engine starts]
What if he don't come out?
He will, and it's "doesn't."
[knocking on glass]
Gentlemen.
So... the restaurant?
Is moving forward.
I just lined up an investor.
In a week you'll have a signed contract in your hands.
I'll need to see this...
alleged contract from this alleged investor in 48 hours.
[stutters] Come on, man, 48 hours?
That's a little tight, don't you think?
You still have nine fingers, Dion, and all those pretty teeth.
[cellphone rings]
Hello?
- Is this Tommy?
- Yeah.
Who is this?
This is Pilar, uh, from grief group.
I mean, from many places, but, in your case, you mostly know me from grief group.
Yeah.
Right.
Yeah.
Uh, hey, Pilar.
Hi, Tommy.
Uh, listen.
Um, I'm sorry to bother you, and I'll be quick.
[Speaking Spanish]
Uh, remember how I said my sister has this restaurant?
Well, we both kind of have it.
Anyways, um, you know, we're always looking for wines that are, you know, unique.
- Unique's good.
- So,
I-
- I was wondering if maybe you could recommend some unique wines?
Yeah, okay.
I'll-
- I'll come up with some ideas for the next meeting.
I could stop by?
I mean, to your place?
Ah... honestly, my place is kind of a mess.
I'm at the old Kramer Piano Factory and we're kind of in the middle of renovations.
It's really more of-- [cellphone beeps]
Uh...
Pilar, sorry.
I'm, uh, I'm getting another call from my boss.
Okay.
Bye.
[indistinct conversations]
Uh, someone's in here.
Are you the kid who doesn't talk?
Dumb question.
Your mom got killed, huh?
Are you gonna at least tell me your name?
Dude!
Cool.
[school bell rings]
You can keep the marker.
Bye.
[Tommy] Frank.
Frank!
Hey.
What's with the uh, cryptic phone call?
Am I getting a promotion?
Walk with me.
Tommy, you got a nose for wines like nobody else.
- Okay.
- But your nose for selling wines--
Come on, Frank.
No one can sell in the territories you got me in.
It's not about the territories, Tommy.
It is about the salesman.
Now I am getting complaints.
You're mixing up your wines.
You're not following through.
You're backing into a construction barrier?
But that [scoffs] I mean, the thing jumped out at me.
I swear.
Okay.
So, what?
Wh-- where's this going?
If this keeps up, I'm gonna have to let you go.
You know what, let me save you the trouble.
All right?
I've had enough.
- [Frank] Of?
- This!
Selling wine in bulk to people who don't know a goddamn Syrah from a Sauterne.
I don't need this.
You know, a friend and I-- we're opening up a restaurant in Morrisania, and it's gonna kill.
You're opening a restaurant in the Bronx?
Yeah.
That's right.
Okay.
Well, once you quit, you can't un-quit.
You got that?
Yeah.

- So?
So what'd he say?
- Who?
Your dad, that's who.
Come on, is he in--
Ah, look, I've had a crappy morning, all right?
I'll ask him some other time.
H-- hey!
What are you doing?
Look, I'm not waiting around for you to grow a pair.
Best way to deal with cold water, bro... lump right in.
Hmm?
Come on, I'll come with, as backup.
[engine starts]
Get in the car.
[engine revs]
- [laughs] Oh, that's-- that's funny.
- I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Look.
I'm just playing around.
Just get in.
[Dion] Whoa!
[laughs] Look, the car's got a mind of its own, man.
- I can't stop it--
- I swear to God, you move one more time...
I sw--
[Dion] Come on, get in.
Ooh, no.
[engine revs] [laughs]
- I missed you.
- [Dion] I missed you, too.
No.
I've really missed you.
How old are we?
[banjo music plays]
Word in the walls is the Asians are expecting a boat-load of merch.
I hadn't heard that.
Must be hard to get solid info with all the limitations of total freedom.
Those Hmong are getting big-bailed, moving in on us.
Don't worry.
Dad, I sent them a very clear message.
[screaming, cracking] [groaning]
That merch will still land.
What have you done about the...
Greek who burned down our restaurant?
All over it.
[Speaking Polish]
[imitates gunshot]
He owes us 600 grand.
Can't get money out of a dead man.
No.
But you can send a message that actually means something.
[slams phone] [fog horn blows]
You're giving him this opportunity, remember that.
All right?
You are a rock star sommelier who I've seen sell a $500 bottle of wine to a table full of bridge and tunnel cretins.
I mean, you got this.
[Dion] Would you relax?
Come on, you're making me nervous.
Just loosen up.
Loosen up.
That's it.
That's it.
That's it.
Loosen up.
You haven't aged well.
Yeah, well, losing a wife can do that to you.
I got meetings up the ass.
What's this offer?
Well, um...
Dion and I have--
Well, actually it was Dion, Rie, and me.
We, uh, we've always wanted our own place, uh, a restaurant.
We'd name it, urn, Thirio.
Yeah, um, it means, uh, it means "beast."
- It means "beast."
- Right.
And we, uh, just wanted to off-- offer, uh...
- I mean, we need someone--
- Yeah, you know what?
- Do you mind if I...
- Please.
Your friend here's about to wet himself.
Mr. Moran, you're a brilliant businessman.
Years ago, you-- you saw there was a ton of money to be made in scaffolding.
Well, we're offering you the opportunity to look at it again, to recognize that the Bronx is New York's last frontier, ready for prospectors to dive right in and strike gold.
How?
What's the one thing everyone says the Bronx doesn't have?
White people.
[scoffs] Right.
White people, and, uh, and restaurants.
Now the first guy, puts his money into a high-end place with great food and a kickass wine list, now that guy, that guy...
is gonna retire on his own private island.
You know what I mean?
What kind of food we talkin'?
Basically Ot-Hellenic.
- The hell is that?
- [Dion] Yeah.
You know what?
It's a fair question.
It's a fair question.
So why don't we do a tasting?
You come by tonight, and we'll prepare some samples of the food and wine that we have in mind.
Six o'clock.
All right.
All right.
[snaps finger] [truck revs, horn honks]
Ris de veau.
That's French.
We're doing Greek.
I'll do it Greek!
Grilled kebabs with lemon and sage.
No.
No sweetbreads, all right?
I do Chéteauneuf with sweetbreads, and all I've got is some '08 on its last legs.
All right.
All right.
All right.
Quail... with roasted grapes, herb-crusted rack of lamb with caramelized fennel, finished with a red wine reduction.
Keep it simple, okay?
It's my dad for Christ's sakes.
He's got to taste the food under the fancy.
All right, fine!
We'll do a simple, freaking seared scallop then... with skordalia and parsley oil.
- Okay.
Yeah.
- Yeah?
Yes!
I've been dying to see how the new Assyrtiko from Santorini pairs with seafood.
I mean, that-- that could really work.
Right.
Right.
Dessert-- dessert:
A panna cotta with figs, apricot, with a honeycomb candy.
If I pair a Sauterne with that, my dad's mouth will explode.
- Yes!
- Which wouldn't be the worst thing.
Yeah.
There he is.
There's my Tommy-boy.
Yes!
Hi.
I'm sorry to just--
I was in the neighborhood, and suddenly I said,
"Oh.
This is where Tommy lives."
So, I...
I hope I'm not interrupting.
No.
No, not at all.
Dion, this is Pilar.
Hey, how you doing?
We're in a... a grief group together.
Nice... that you have that in common.
[Pilar chuckles]
So, I was wondering about those, um, wine ideas.
Oh, right.
Yeah.
Of course.
Yeah, I just got to, um...
Oh, wait, no.
Sorry.
Shoot.
L-
- I got to go pick up my son from school.
- So, I-- - [Dion] Tommy, are you kidding me?
Come on, dude.
Chill.
Stay here.
I'll go pick him up.
No.
What are you talking about?
Y-
- Yeah, yeah.
No, no.
I'll go get him.
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'll go!
Dion, whoa!
Right.
And I'll get my jacket.
Thanks.
[door closes]
So... you're, uh, renovating?
Well, we're, uh, we're getting ready to.
We're turning this place into a restaurant.
A restaurant?
- Here?
- Yes.
Here in the Bronx.
Wow.
That's so... valiente.
Thank you.
What's the haps, T.J.?
Put it there, man.
Look, your dad's kind of busy, so I'm gonna be your Uber.
Okay?
All right, come on, get in the car.
Oh, uh, excuse me.
Sir, hi.
Um, I'm T.J.'s school counselor.
I don't remember anyone but his dad being authorized to pick him up.
I'm Dion Patras.
Tommy brought me on as T.J.'s...
support person.
Su-- support person?
I'm here to try and help the boy through all of this.
I'll be his ride, help him with his homework, give him someone to...
to hang with, while his dad's spiraling.
Well, at least Tommy's reaching out for some help, right?
- Mm.
- Thank you.
Oh, thank you.
Thank you.
Hey, you know that kid?
I got to make a few stops, uh, before we head home, okay, champ?
[grunts]
What, you got something wrong with your side?
Let me take a look at that.
Aw, Jesus, T.J. someone hit you?
Purple hat do that to you?
Alright, God damn it.
[breathes heavily]
Are you sure you want to handle this yourself?
[chuckles lightly] All right.
Good man.
[engine starts]
I told you those five-inch heels will mess you up.
[both chuckle]
You're supposed to be in Paris.
What the hell happened?
I got no family there.
You're not going to want to hang out here.
Tooth Fairy is upstairs.
Tasha?
Could you get my buddy T.J. here some snacks?
Come on, T.J.
[chuckles]
I worked out an arrangement with the Tooth Fairy.
I just got to get some more cash.
Tommy and I are doing a tasting.
I-
- I got to get some more ingredients.
I'm bored already.
Give me a hand.
[man] What do you think you're doing?
You walking out on me?
Get the hell back in there.
I paid for this!
Wait outside.
[woman screams] [tires screech] [tires screech, woman screams]
[Crying] You got your money, bitch.
What the hell does it matter?
What is going on?
Touch her again, asshole, and your brains are in Yankee Stadium!
I want you and your boy out of my place.
I think two dignified men can do better than to have a throwdown in a musty old whorehouse.
Gave you a little extra to cover future dental work.
Billy.
[knock on window] I don't know what arrangement you have with that Tooth Fairy Polak, but... be careful, huh?
You're all I got.
You got it.
Thanks.
[engine starts]
Oh, Teej, come here.
Come here.
Smell this. [sniffs]
Let's pick a good one.
All right, smell that.
Ah, Mrs. Chung.
Look at this.
I like the look of these diver scallops.
You know what, you can lay about half a dozen on for me, okay?
I'll be back to pick them up.
Come on, you.
Hey, Eduardo.
- Dion.
What's up, brother?
- Good, man.
Listen, I need a four-pound rack of upstate New York lamb.
And uh...
You got any spice?
- That's it?
- That's all I got.
My dealer says the Asians are waiting on a huge shipment.
[Eduardo] Coming in any day.
All right, let's talk lamb.
I got to get cooking.
Teej, come on.
[guitar music plays]
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold on, Chef.
The secret to cutting a zucchini, you got to cut it in half, it keeps it steady, okay?
You don't want to lose a finger.
All right.
[mid-tempo music plays]
[woman laughs] [both laugh]
All right.
Moderate-plus tannins.
Moderate-plus to high acidity.
Moderate-plus alcohol.
High complexity with a long finish.
Definitely Old World.
Okay, babe.
Keep going.
I'm gonna say Italy, probably Tuscany.
Brunello di Montalcino.
- Right, so?
- Bring it home.
Bring it home.
Come on, T, you got this.
I say vintage... 2007.
- Gooooooal!
- Yes!
[Dion] Oh!
Oh!
Oh, my man!
My man!
- [Dion] You're the best!
- Not bad, not bad.
[Sniffs] [mid-tempo music plays]
[pan sizzling] Come here, come here.
You hear that?
That sizzle sound?
Hmm?
Now that's the pan talking to me.
Now, remember, a good chef always listens to his pans.
It'll tell me when the filet's ready to be turned or the chop is gonna hit medium-rare.
It's a-- a listening thing.
You got that?
All right, good man.
Oh, well there he is.
Mr. Thomas Moran, sommelier extraordinaire.
[Dion] You look good, man.
Great idea.
Oh, let's, uh, let's have a toast.
Bringing good luck to this very special, very important thing--
Are we doing this or not?
Oh, shit, he's early.
Who do I got to screw to get a meal around here?
Mr. Moran.
T.J., this is your grandfather.
Aidan, this is Thomas Jr.
So, feed me.
All right.
We're good.
Go.
The 2012 Premier Cru Chablis.
Hints of oyster shell and mineral.
Beautifully suited to be paired--
Just pour.
Abalone.
- Scallop.
- Same difference.
Well, actually, you'll find--
Next course, Chef.
[guitar music plays]
For this, we recommend an earth-driven and light-bodied pinot noir from Vosne-Romanée.
The hell is this, a pigeon?
That is a sous vide quail with roasted grapes and a cracked wheat salad.
For all I know, it's a bird you found up in your attic.
- Yeah, well, with all due respect--
- Chef.
Main course, please.
[Quietly] Right.
Rack of lamb with roasted eggplant and a kalamata tapenade.
As for pairing, I suggest a traditional 2001 Gran Reserve Rioja.
Delicious.
The food under the fancy.
And to go with your dessert, a 2005 Sauternes.
Honey-dipped tropical fruits with notes of vanilla bean.
So... what do you think?
I don't go for this candy-ass crap.
You have no clue what an incredible meal you just had.
What Dion's cooking--
You're right.
The Bronx is going to gentrify and get busy real soon, and all those brave souls are gonna need to be fed.
May as well eat at your fancy restaurant... which I'd own half of.
With one condition;
I get to see my grandson every week.
What?
No.
No.
Uh, no, absolutely not.
Can we just discuss this privately, partner?
- No.
No.
There's nothing to--
- Yeah, in the kitchen, now.
No way.
It's not happening.
Come on, he's the kid's grandfather.
He's also a racist prick who's never even bothered to see his own grandchild, who, by the way, is black.
What?
I think he's saying he wants to do it.
He doesn't understand.
Maybe your old man has changed.
" [scoffs]
- Huh?
I mean, maybe...
maybe this is his way of reaching out.
All right, we have a deal.
- We'll send over a contract tomorrow.
- Already done.
Nice, yeah.
It's, uh, it's efficient.
Yeah, we're gonna give this a once-over.
We'll send you a signed copy in the morning.
Hey, and thank you!
[smooches, sighs]
We got ourselves a restaurant.
Living the dream, baby!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
My dad didn't get rich by playing fair, all right?
We got to get someone to look that over.
What do you mean?
Like-- like a lawyer?
It's what you do.
Fine.
I got someone.
We are so doing this!
II [buzzer sounds]
What are you doing here?
What?
What, now that I'm out of prison,
I can't have contact with you?
Are you a known felon?
[chuckles] I have company.
There's, uh, there's something I need to talk to you about.
Which is?
I need, uh...
I need legal advice.
Look, we're about to open up this restaurant, and the investor's given us this massive contract.
Look, is there any chance you could eyeball it just to, I don't know, let us know if it...
I don't know, if it looks okay?
You're just out of prison.
You're broke.
[Marisa] I don't work pro bono.
So, no, there is no chance.
Good night.
[door closes] [exhales] [man] Marisa, you coming?
Okay, Dad.
Your mom slaves all afternoon over her ziti and you're letting it get cold.
Come on.
Can't you just give it a shot?
What happened to your person?
My person?
My person was busy.
She had company.
I don't know.
Anyway, besides, it's your turn.
Can't you just call your little pretty friend?
Pilar manages her sister's restaurant.
She doesn't have time to pore over every detail of that contract.
Yeah, dude, she does.
Tommy, come on.
Why don't you--
She was "in the neighborhood"?
No,no,no.
People come to this neighborhood come to score drugs.
And that Pilar chick, she wants your skinny ass.
Besides, man, don't you think it's time to, you know, open your mind to the possibility of...
of meeting a woman.
Pilar, hi.
This is Tommy.
From, uh-- the wine guy.
Sorry to bother you.
You're probably super busy.
Kind of, but I can take a break.
Uh, great.
Um, well, you remember, um-- you remember how I-
- I told you that Dion and I were-- were, uh, opening a restaurant?
Yeah.
And, uh, good for you.
Yeah, but the thing is the investor has just dumped this contract on us, right?
And, well, you know, Dion knows food and I know wine, but neither of us knows a damn thing about the legal part of it all.
- Uh-huh.
- So, I was wondering if maybe you-- you might have some time to kind of look it over.
You know, tell us-- tell us if it seems okay?
...I'll look at your contract, yeah.
Great.
Um... [chuckles]
Uh, do, um, you want to text me your e-mail?
- Thank you so much.
- No, thank you.
I mean, see you later.
Okay, bye-
[Tommy] Sure you want to do this?
'Cause I can tell him you changed your mind, you know?
You got-- you got too much homework, or--
[guitar music plays]
[engine starts]
Exactly why does this guy think you might be able to help him with this?
Quién sabe.
I mean, he's starting up a restaurant.
- Mm-hmm.
- I told him I work at one.
Mm-hmm.
So, I guess he just thinks I'm smart.
- It's possible.
- You are smart, mamita.
You're just scattered.
Look, I don't have time for this, but at a glance, I mean, there are some things in here that'll come back to bite the ass of whoever signs it.
I sure wouldn't.
All right.
[Tommy] You'll never guess what happened.
It's a funny story.
We ran into my dad.
Yeah.
Me and T.J. Um, you know, a total accident, but there he was, and I sort of had to introduce them.
Believe it or not, they-- they hit it off.
T.J. said he'd like to spend some time with him, and my dad didn't seem to mind, so, I guess it's like you always said.
Even a crusty old racist like my father can't resist that boy's beautiful face.
You were right.
Again.
[clock ticking]
You play chess?
Your father never taught you?
[sighs]
You got to pee?
The bathroom's through the kitchen.
[siren wails, horns honking]
[Pilar] Hello?
Tommy?
Hola.
Oh, hi.
I was looking for-
- How are you?
I'm good.
You know, Tommy's-
- Tommy's not here.
Okay.
Urn, I'll--
Wait, wait, wait, is that-- is that the contract?
How's it look?
I mean, we all good?
Well, actually, there's some issues with it.
Oh, like what?
Give me an example.
Well, like, it doesn't specifically say the name of the restaurant, and the location is kind of unclear.
No contract is perfect, all right?
You know, and a lot of these issues, they, uh-- they go away over time.
I just think Tommy should be aware that it's, uh, not a good contract, and you guys shouldn't sign it.
Look, I get the distinct impression that you like Tommy.
If so, then you probably give a shit about what's good for him.
...guy lost his wife.
Now his kid's a mute.
The guy's life's been in a nose dive for, like, a year.
These past few days,
I've been seeing signs of the old Tommy.
I mean, this whole restaurant idea's really got his... his blood pumping again, which is a good thing.
If you want to bring all that crashing down, send him back into his damn rut, crush his dream... that's entirely on you.
I just think he should know.
[guitar music plays]
What are you doing in here?
I didn't say you could wander around.
Get in the kitchen.
Jensen made you a sandwich.
But it's still the same.
Truck backfires, a loud...
clang at a construction site, and my mind, it goes back there to the boys who didn't make it out.
To my friends.
Good.
Uh, anybody-- anybody else?
Anybody else want to share?
Tommy, how about you?
Uh...
Okay.
I mean, I guess that things are pretty much the same.
- Mm-hmm.
- Actually, not really.
Just felt weird not to start off that way.
[laughter]
Lately there's been a lot of things thrown at me.
Changes.
Urn, and it's made me feel...
Well, that's just it. it-- It's made me feel.
You know, the last few days, I haven't woken up depressed.
It's like I'm just starting to shake off this-- this fog.
[Tommy] I think my son sees that.
It's important to me that-- that when he looks at me, he doesn't see zombie dad.
You know, he sees...
he sees his father.
I'm really happy for you.
Sounds like you're... optimistic.
Well, optimistic adjacent.
[chuckles]
Hey, did you, uh, did you read the contract?
- I did.
- What'd you think?
[sniffing]
- Hello.
- God!
Phew!
Well?
Dude, the contract?
Pilar says we're good.
[maps]
I would kiss you on the mouth if it wouldn't start rumors.
Where you going?
Don't you want to celebrate?
Just got to make a copy.
It's... it's what you do.
[smooches] [door closes]
II
[tires screech]
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
One thing I hate... waiting.
Cable guy, UPS, mailman, you.
I can't just go to the Tooth Fairy and get him to tell me all the bad things he's ever done.
It doesn't work like that.
One or two would do.
I have something that might interest you, though.
The Asians?
Getting a huge shipment of blow coming in any day.
[tires screech]
- God!
- I don't give a rat's ass about the Asians.
I want that fat Polak.
Ahab, remember?
Huh?
- White whale, remember?
- [grunts]
Get out of my car.
[Tommy] Hey, buddy.
How's it going?
Why don't you head upstairs, get ready for bed, yeah?
I'll be up in a minute.
- You're late.
- You don't discipline the boy?
What?
What do you mean?
You might want to teach him some rules.
Does things without asking.
Free thinker, like his mother.
Never say anything about my wife.
Hey, Teej, you left your math book on the--
What's that?
Hey, what is that?
Hey.
Where'd you get those bruises?
It's really important you tell me where you got those bruises.
Did that happen today?
Okay, get in bed.
Do your homework.
Do not leave this room.
[door closes]
You son of a bitch.
You hit my kid?
Suppose I did.
What would you do about it?
You are not doing that to him, too, you mother-- [grunting]
II
[gun cocks]
I'd blow your brains out, but this is a $30,000 Persian rug.
[Tommy] We're done with him!
I don't want anything to do with that scum-sucking son of a bitch or his goddamn dirty money!
I don't care if we don't do the restaurant, all right?
!
We are not doing business with my father!
Okay.
I hear you.
Something wrong?
Nope.
[chuckles lightly]
All good.

I will find Simon's body and when I do,
Liam and Eleanor's paternity will be verified and you'll be replaced.
No Simon, no DNA, no Paternity.
We have an opening for the king's head of security.
I'd like it to be you.
Can't remember the last time I went this long without having sex.
Maybe I could arrange a little service call for your Majesty.
It's a pleasure to finally meet our new lord Chamberlain.
Violet, I love you.
'I'm sorry I messed up.'
Jasper.
I've decided to forgive you.
- For what?
- All of it.
Hashtag, 'King Liam movement.'
I'd like to know where it started.
Better still, who started it.
You will find that taking a life is an unbearable weight.
Sorry, we're shut.
I thought about you a lot.
I should have done more for you.

- Hi.
- Hello.
Are you a Princess?
- That's what they tell me.
- Where's your crown?
I don't sleep in the crown.
It's too pointy.
Do you have one?
- I suppose I do, yeah.
- How about glass slippers?
I'm a Princess, not Cinderella.
- What about a prince?
- What about it?
- Do you have one?
- Well, define 'Prince.'
You know, like a boy who likes you
And rides a white horse and kisses you awake sometimes.
I have several princes, yeah.
I'm not too sure about the white horse part.
Okay, good.
See you later.
- Bye.
- Wait!
Who are you, exactly, again?
Oh.
I'm called Sara Alice.
You can call me Sara or Alice.
Or whatever you want,
Considering you're a Princess.
I appreciate that.
Thank you.
Ooh, is that fairy dust?
Stop!
That's...
Poison from the evil queen.
You know the story.
I do know all about it, yes.
Good.
Well, don't ever touch that.
Whoever you are.
Sara Alice.
Yes, of course.
You said that.
Right...
Are you sure you're a Princess?
I'm pretty sure, yeah.
Why?
Did you swallow some of the wicked queen's poison?
I think some got in my nose, yeah.
I can tell.
You don't look very Princess-y.
That's very nice.
Come on, let's go,
Sara Alice in the palace.
Heel!
I'm not a dog, but I'd love to have one.
Daddy says I'm allergic to dogs, cats, and horses.
Right...
How's the hangover?
I feel like a pack of wild dogs dragged me through the streets.
You look like it, too.
Here.
- Thanks.
- Cup of tea isn't too much to ask before the motorcade steals you away.
- You know the story.
- I do.
I erm, put my number in your phone.
You know, in case you find yourself drunk or once again cornered by rabid dogs.
- How have you been, Kathryn?
- I've been okay.
- Keeping busy.
- Yeah.
Same.
Not the same kind of busyness at all.
The rest of it's the same.
Last time I saw you...
We took that picture.
I remember.
For what it's worth, you look good.
Thanks.
You, not so much.
Thanks for the tea.
Erm, you got your phone?
Wallet, keys?
I don't have keys.
I'm a prince.
Yes, you certainly are.
We always have to remember that.
No, you always have to remember that.
Thank you.
It really is wonderful to see you.
Go.
I have to list your cup on ebay.

Your Majesty.
Mr Hoenigsberg.
- Everyone else walk away.
- Thank you.
Choose your next words very carefully.
Ah!
At 11:00am, your Majesty has an audience
With her Majesty Queen Letizia of Spain
Regarding the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization.
I took the Liberty of including some background materials as they pertain to her Majesty's work as Special Ambassador for Nutrition.
At 1300, you have a luncheon and tea with several members of the League of Women for the Preservation of London.
Those bitches are relentless.
Very well.
In the future, I like to know the menu in advance for my lunches.
I...
Yes, ma'am.
This afternoon's main course will be the smoked salmon with lemon butter and watercress.
And if I may suggest the Oolong Formosa tea.
Fermented Tea from Taiwan, featuring an attractive Amber hue,
A gentle multi-taste, yet a robust and fully-developed Aroma.
- Anything else?
- You'll look pretty in the pink one.
Strictly professional, Mr Hoenigsberg.
Of course.
Forgive me, your Majesty.

Shouldn't you be wearing a crown right now?
At least a ribbon in your hair.
Isn't your hair supposed to be blonde?
- Ssh!
- At least more golden-y colored.
- Ssh!
- Hey, nice underpants.
I found this in my room.
You can have it.
- Be warned, it's chatty.
- Argh!
Well, what am I supposed to do with her?
Try asking your boss.
- You're short.
- Do you know anything about children?
No.
But I do carry a gun.
Let's go.
My daddy is James Hill.
I assumed as much.
You know why?
- Why?
- Because he's short, too.
You walk too fast.
You know your legs are longer than mine.
Can you get me some ice cream?
I have to say, it was a big surprise when your people reached out, your Majesty.
I wasn't doing anything else, so I thought, 'what the hell?
'
I hear you have a big secret announcement for us.
You may have noticed that my signature sideburns are gone.
It's because my hair's been falling out.
Male pattern baldness.
Comes hand in hand with er, erectile dysfunction.
Yes, I have that, too.
Because I had a testicle removed.
You see, I have cancer.
And it appears to be winning.
Why now?
Why tell the world like this, tonight?
Because there are people in the palace
Who think they can manipulate me with this information.
So I'd rather share it with the world than a precious few takes their power away.
Are you hoping they'll feel more sentimental towards you and your reign?
Dear God, I hope not.
Most of my family are treacherous assholes.
They hide behind fake smiles and loud charity, like a bunch of Hollywood actresses.
Well, the truth is they don't care about you.
They care about their image.
That and their billion-dollar empire.
The only true good person in that entire palace...
Was Violet.
And now she's gone, too.
So you can say what you want about me,
And think what you'd like,
But at least I'm honest with you.
Remember that when I'm gone.
Should be any day now.
You get cash back on purchases with no annual fee.
Ah, wilhelmina.
Your Majesty.
- Do you prefer Wilhelmina or Willow?
- Willow is fine.
- Willow, good.
- I prefer Your Majesty.
- Walk with me.
I'm compelled by your understanding of social media.
How you manipulated a nation with hashtag 'king Liam.'
I merely planted the seed, your Majesty.
Well, the seeds have blossomed nicely.
I'd like to hire you.
To do what, exactly?
Whatever it is you did and however it is you did it.
We're an Archaic Institution.
Liam's reign is going to need fresh ideas.
Liam's reign?
I'm going to prove that Liam is the legitimate heir to the throne.
And when I do, I want to make sure that the world insists that he become king.
Will you help me advance that message?
If I thought I could trust you, I would do this.
For Liam, because I do believe in him.
Then I guess you're hired, because you can trust me.
At least in regards to this.
And, Willow, the information about proving Liam's paternity, let's keep that off the face page for a bit, shall we?
- What?
- Your eyebrows look like caterpillars.
Daddy!
I thought if I let you wander a bit,
A man with sweets might trick you into his Van or something.
Mr caterpillar is taking care of me.
- Jasper.
- Can I go and see the Princess again?
Fine.
Go.
Give your friend the Caterpillar a rest.
Jasper.
He had a mean girlfriend named Sara once.
Now I'm his nice girlfriend.
Hey.
What are the rules?
No fire, no knives, and if anyone finds me, tell them I came from the womb of a jackal.
Perfect.
Be careful.
Okay, I will.
Bye, Jasper caterpillar.
What are your intentions with my daughter?
Speaking of girlfriends, I understand
You and the Princess are getting closer?
How do you know that?
I'm the head of security.
Did you notice my new suit?
We're um, doing better.
Well, as pleased as I am for the both of you, and I am,
Have you considered what comes next?
The Princess so much as glances at someone, it's headline news.
She holds their hand, it goes global.
If the public uncovers your relationship, the level of scrutiny would be unprecedented.
I'm not just talking about your accent.
I've got to go.
I'll do what I can to help.
Hang in there, kid.
'The only true good person in that entire palace...
Was Violet.
And now she's gone, too.'
We're doing an assessment of the public's reaction to the news of his cancer.
And the rest of it.
At this rate he's going to kill the monarchy before cancer kills him.
We need to get into that lair of his and find some DNA.
Hair or toenails or a used condom.
Something!
He has his own guards stationed outside the room.
He rarely exits.
Most of the time he uses his double.
Do you trust James Hill, your Majesty?
Is he team Helena?
Yes, I believe he is.
Then as far as I'm concerned,
His Majesty just told us everything we need to secure your proof, tonight.
There's something you'd like to tell me?
Do you have any idea how dangerous that question is for me?
Word on the street...
Is that you're seeing other girls.
Sara Alice?
She seems to be quite smitten with you.
Well, can you blame her?
And anyway, we never said that we were exclusive.
Is that right?
A little cocky for a guy of your misdeeds.
I'll play along.
You're right, we never said we were exclusive.
But you do understand that that works both ways, yes?
I understand that, yep.
Good.
Good, good, good.
Good talk.
Go away.
I gave at the office.
It's James Hill, your Majesty.
Er, your new head of security?
Little small for such a big job, aren't we, biggie smalls?
With all due respect, your Majesty, the last guy was taller, but killed people.
And besides, your Majesty seems to be accomplishing great things
Whilst being the opposite of tall.
Sucking up as opposed to simply sucking off will get you nowhere with me, Mr Hill.
What do you want?
I need you to come to my office so we can scan your retinas.
Forget it.
Bring it to me.
I'm afraid that's not possible, your Majesty.
Well, then you won't be scanning my peepers, Hill.
I understand.
But should your Majesty decide to leave the palace
At some point in the future, including through the not-so-secret tunnels, we'll need your retinal scans on file.
I do apologize for the inconvenience.
Fine.
I'll be there when it suits me.
Hello, Liam.
I don't like the sound of that.
What?
I feel like I have hardly seen you lately.
I just...
Geez, what is up with you?
I'm...
Dealing with some stuff.
God, by letting it kick your ass?
Just...
Hold still.
What stuff?
I've been thinking a lot about Ted.
Okay.
He wasn't always a bad guy, you know.
He just... gave into the darkness and couldn't find his way back.
Okay, and what does that have to do with this?
I'm trying to find my way back.
Trying not to give in.
Do you want some advice?
Stop getting punched in the face.
Ted had a choice to make and so do you.
He chose darkness and you won't.
- Okay?
- Ow...
Right, so I was thinking, how'd you like to get out of town for the day
And hang out with me?
The electric carnival is on.
Thanks, I think I'm just gonna lay low for a few days.
Come on.
We'll have a dance, couple of cocktails.
Jasper could be our security detail.
- Jasper?
- Sure, why not?
You guys hanging out again?
Non-exclusive by any chance?
Possibly.
Why?
You don't want to hang out with me, you want to make Jasper jealous.
A-A-A-Ah.
That's ridiculous.
Fine, I want to make him jealous.
I do.
Jasper thinks that he can have the cow,
And still drink from its teats.
- Not even close.
- You know what I mean.
I need to teach him a lesson so you have to come with me.
- Plus, it will be fun, Liam.
- Come on.
That's all you had to say.
Everyone's so deceitful around here.
Let the guy wearing make-up.
Give us some dirt, Princess.
Who are you dating at the moment?
Er, no-one exclusively.
Prince Robert, when you first landed on the island, what were your initial thoughts?
Wow!
I was hoping that the rescue would be successful.
I thought if I could simply stay coherent,
Keep myself visible, the search party would find me.
But when that storm kicked in and lasted for as long as it did,
I realized I'd be stranded for a bit.
At that point it was all about staying alive.
- Day by day.
- And how did you do that?
Did you have shelter or any supplies?
I had a military issue scabbard that belonged to my father,
I had a single flare and a small compass.
The rest I made up on the fly.
You survived for eight months with nothing but an antique knife?
My father's knife.
Is it true you chose to stay on the island?
They say you could have come home.
That there was a boat you could have signaled.
But you didn't.
Is that true, Robby?
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Excuse me, that's my table.
Charlie Madden.
It's a good thing we have security.
- Hey, what up, Madden?
- How are you doing, mate?
Mwah!
- Nice to see you.
How are you?
- Very well.
- I know you're not here solo.
- God, no.
My entire crew is here.
Most of them hoping to meet the Princess.
And er, someone else you might know.
I didn't know you two knew each other.
We just met, actually.
And I thought you had better judgment.
Oh!
Wow.
Buy you both a free drink?
- Yes, please.
- Alright.
I want to meet these friends, Madden.
- No.
Patience.
- Immediately.
- Alright, Willow, this one's for you.
- Thank you.
Madden.
You need my eyes?
That's all you're getting.
- Make it quick, Hill.
- As you wish.
Please, sit here.
I'll prepare the scan.
We located a double that bears a striking resemblance to the king, as long as he doesn't have to speak.
Violet?
You understand she's just trying to make you jealous?
- Yes.
- And?
It's working.
Come back?
Okay.
- You want some advice?
- Let her do her thing.
I know my sister.
It will completely infuriate her if you don't...
Violet?
Violet!
Violet!
Yes!
Oh, my God...
OMG, this is so exciting.
Good God, where did you find this guy?
Gay strip club.
Apparently he does quite well.
Hm, it's kinda tacky.
You're killing him, you realize that?
Mm.
We're just having fun.
He loves it.
He does not love it.
But let's say you make him jealous.
Then what?
Then he'll admit that he wants to be exclusive.
That's what you want?
To be exclusive?
No, I just want him to want to be exclusive.
Jasper has to admit that he wants me and only me before I can say the slightest thing about maybe possibly wanting him.
It's, like, girl 101, dum-dum.
Mm!
Be glad your mother got out when she did, Willow.
You never have to deal with any of this madness.
Yeah, about that...
The queen offered me a job in the palace today.
Doing what, exactly?
As best I can tell,
She wants me to spend my days and nights saying nice things about you.
Tough job.
But if you think it might get in the way of our friendship, I won't take it.
We won't let that happen.
I think the monarchy is lucky to have you.
And so am I.
Although you do understand what a circus my family is?
Tthey can't be that bad.
Nothing.
It's like the man's hairless cat.
Rachel, anything?
No, Ma'am.
Mr Hoenigsberg?
I regret to say, not a thing, your Majesty.
Would a testicle work?
Ah!
Vanity.
The enemy of wisdom and common sense.
Let's go.
Hello, Jasper.
The boys I've been flirting with, they keep disappearing.
You wouldn't happen to know anything about that, would you?
No?
Okay, follow-up question.
This morning I had to cover my brother's cuts and bruises.
Is there anything you can tell me about that?
His highness asked me not to.
Oh, is that right?
Well, is there anything that you can tell me?
I can tell you that the weight of what happened at the king's cup has affected him a great deal.
A lot more than he thinks.
The burden of 'hashtag king Liam' makes him feel guilty,
There's a girl he likes but he's trying to keep his distance, most likely to protect her, and I can tell you that he loves his sister very much.
Not very discreet, are you, Jasper?
No, I'm massively discreet.
But in this case I think you might be able to help him.
And besides, he's the brother of a girl I care about.
Well played.
Liam, I love you!
It's constant, isn't it?
The fascination with len and you and your family.
Living life under the microscope, perpetual scrutiny.
You must want to...
Step away from it all sometimes.
Sometimes.
Truth is, from the moment I was born...
It's never been an option.
You do a good job with it.
It was worse for Robert.
We could hide every now and then.
He was always in the spotlight.
What do you want?
(excited screaming and yelling)
You okay?
I am.
Just been thinking about Robby.
I've been doing that a lot lately.
He'd be proud of you, you know.
I'm not so sure that's true.
Well, it is and you know it is.
I've been asking myself if I'm a good person lately.
Because of Ted?
Because of all kinds of things.
Well, the answer is 'yes, ' no matter what.
No matter what, okay?
- Can I tell you something?
- Yeah.
I want to be exclusive with Jasper.
But sometimes I feel like I'm not good enough
And that my shit-show of a life isn't fair to him, so...
You understand he's a conman from las Vegas who tried to rob you and slept with our mother?
And yet my life still seems messier.
He can handle it.
So can she.
The girl in your head.
Ever since Robby died, you have been as selfless as anyone I've ever known.
You put me first, put mum first, dad's legacy, all of it.
Put you first, Liam.
It's okay to be happy.
And to want someone who makes your heart race.
Your goodness?
It's easy to see.
You deserve to have whatever you want or whoever you want.
I promise, okay?
Same.
Yeah...
Come in.
- Hi.
- Hi.
No Liam again tonight?
No.
He asked for some time alone.
Is he going to need more make-up in the morning?
I think he's done with all that.
I hope so.
Can you unzip me, please?
- Did you have fun today?
- Not really, no.
Why not?
I think you know why not.
Didn't like the music?
Well, I thought it was a perfectly nice day.
Good music, nice friends.
Cute boys.
Not that it was exclusively about the cute boys,
But I mean, it didn't hurt.
I think you've made your point.
What point?
Were you jealous?
You're Goddamn right I was jealous.
I just spent the last 12 hours watching a bunch of douchebags hit on my...
I want to be with you.
You know I do, but I can never be sanctioned.
We can never have days like we had today together.
They'll find out about my past.
That's okay, I've done what I've done
But they'll hold it against you and that's not okay.
I couldn't do that to you.
I never would.
Come with me.
600 years ago there was a Royal.
A young queen, actually.
And she fell for her bodyguard.
Imagine that.
- Were they exclusive?
- Watch it.
They started this epic, earth-shattering love affair.
Quietly, secretly.
Quite scandalous, but it didn't matter to them.
And they would write the most romantic, aching love letters and hide them in a hollowed-out book.
This book.
Every time I enter this library I look inside...
For a letter of my own.
It's not fair to you to ask you to have to settle for someone you'd have to hide from the world.
Who says I'd be settling?
So what happened to this queen and her bodyguard?
They got married.
They had two sons, who both did great things.
One of them was called Jasper.
Jasper Tudor.
You may have heard of them, the Tudors.
It's a true story.
You take my breath away, you know that?
Of course I do.
Maybe you should try writing that down sometime.
Hi.
Hi.
I wanted to see you.
From the time I was born, I was taught not to say what I was thinking,
Not to listen to my heart,
But tonight I want to tell the truth.
It's what I should have done the first moment I saw you.
Yeah, but you didn't.
And, yes, when you texted me, my heart skipped a beat.
But I can think of a million reasons why we can't do this.
I can think of one big reason...
My heart is a disaster.
My head's even worse and I know this isn't easy for you.
But I want you, and I know you feel it too.
Oh, Liam...
Kiss me and then tell me if I should stay or go.
Stay.
You tricked me!
Yes, I did.
What have I ever done to you?
You should pour yourself a drink, Cyrus.
My answer will take a while.
All these years I stood by you.
I conspired with you.
And look where it got you.
Your face is on our currency.
Your head wears a crown.
You were a footnote.
Now you're a king.
You're welcome.
Don't be so certain about those results.
It's not like you kept your legs closed.
And even if the little bastards are Simon's,
You think I'm giving up my reign without a fight?
I'm a dying man with sovereign immunity and nothing to lose.
So, you'd better watch your back...
Bitch.
Wake up.
Time to go home.
I'm not asleep.
Did you have a good day at the palace?
Uh-huh.
I did all kinds of things.
What did you do today, daddy?
Do you remember when you were a little girl and you said, "Help them, daddy"?
That's what I did today.
And that's what I'll do tomorrow.
Until they can help themselves?
Until they can help themselves.

'Previously on The Royals...'
I will find Simon's body and when I do,
Liam and Eleanor's paternity will be verified and you'll be replaced.
No Simon, no DNA, no paternity.
We have an opening for the King's head of security.
I'd like it to be you.
Can't remember the last time I went this long without having sex.
Maybe I could arrange a little service call for Your Majesty.
It's a pleasure to finally meet our new Lord Chamberlain.
Violet, I love you.
'I'm sorry I messed up.'
Jasper.
I've decided to forgive you.
- For what?
- All of it.
Hashtag, 'King Liam Movement.'
I'd like to know where it started.
Better still, who started it.
You will find that taking a life is an unbearable weight.
Sorry, we're shut.
I thought about you a lot.
I should have done more for you.
(Clamoring of people)
(Multiple questions being shouted)
Prince Robert, how did you survive on the island?
- Were you scared?
- Describe the moment you knew you were in peril.
Did you think you were going to die?
(Clamoring resumes)
(Camera shutters clicking)
- Hi.
- Hello.
Are you a princess?
- That's what they tell me.
- Where's your crown?
I don't sleep in the crown.
It's too pointy.
Do you have one?
- I suppose I do, yeah.
- How about glass slippers?
I'm a princess, not Cinderella.
- What about a prince?
- What about it?
- Do you have one?
- Well, define 'prince.'
You know, like a boy who likes you and rides a white horse and kisses you awake sometimes.
I have several princes, yeah.
I'm not too sure about the white horse part.
Okay, good.
See you later.
Bye.
Wait!
(Groans) Who are you, exactly, again?
Oh.
I'm called Sara Alice.
You can call me Sara or Alice.
Or whatever you want, considering you're a princess.
I appreciate that.
Thank you.
(Groans)
- Ooh, is that fairy dust?
- Stop!
That's... poison from the evil Queen.
- You know the story.
- I do know all about it, yes.
Good.
Well, don't ever touch that.
- Whoever you are.
- Sara Alice.
Yes, of course.
You said that.
Right...
Are you sure you're a princess?
I'm pretty sure, yeah.
Why?
Did you swallow some of the wicked Queen's poison?
I think some got in my nose, yeah.
I can tell.
You don't look very princess-y.
That's very nice.
Come on, let's go,
Sara Alice in the palace.
Heel!
I'm not a dog, but I'd love to have one.
Daddy says I'm allergic to dogs, cats, and horses.
Right... (KATHRYN) How's the hangover?
(Giggles)
I feel like a pack of wild dogs dragged me through the streets.
You look like it, too.
Here.
- Thanks.
- Cup of tea isn't too much to ask before the motorcade steals you away.
- You know the story.
- I do.
I erm, put my number in your phone.
You know, in case you find yourself drunk or once again cornered by rabid dogs.
- How have you been, Kathryn?
- I've been okay.
- Keeping busy.
- Yeah.
Same.
Not the same kind of busyness at all.
The rest of it's the same.
- Last time I saw you...
- We took that picture.
I remember.
For what it's worth, you look good.
Thanks.
You, not so much.
Thanks for the tea.
Erm, you got your phone?
Wallet, keys?
I don't have keys.
I'm a prince.
Yes, you certainly are.
We always have to remember that.
No, you always have to remember that.
Thank you.
It really is wonderful to see you.
Go.
I have to list your cup on eBay.
(Laughs)
(Sighs)
- Enter. * I love me
* I love me
* I don't know about you
* But, baby, I love me
* Now everybody say, 'Hey-ey-ey'
* Hey-ey-ey!
* I love me
* Hey-ey-ey
* I love me
* They're gonna say all kinds of things
* They'll make jokes about my name
* They're gonna try to clip my wings
* But I'm gonna fly * I'm gonna fly
* They'll play me like a... *
- Your Majesty.
- Mr Hoenigsberg.
Everyone else walk away.
Thank you.
Choose your next words very carefully.
At 11:00am, Your Majesty has an audience with Her Majesty Queen Letizia of Spain regarding the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization.
I took the liberty of including some background materials as they pertain to Her Majesty's work as special ambassador for nutrition.
At 1300, you have a luncheon and tea with several members of the League of Women for the Preservation of London.
(Groans) Those bitches are relentless.
Very well.
In the future, I like to know the menu in advance for my lunches.
Yes, ma'am.
This afternoon's main course will be the smoked salmon with lemon butter and watercress.
And if I may suggest the Oolong Formosa tea.
Fermented tea from Taiwan, featuring an attractive amber hue, a gentle multi-taste, yet a robust and fully-developed aroma.
- Anything else?
- You'll look pretty in the pink one.
Strictly professional, Mr Hoenigsberg.
Of course.
Forgive me, Your Majesty.
* You can tell by the way I talk
* You can tell by the way I walk
* I can see clear when looking in the mirror
* Saying, 'God made me just right'
* Oh, I love me...
Shouldn't you be wearing a crown right now?
At least a ribbon in your hair.
- (Groans)
- Isn't your hair supposed to be blonde?
- Ssh!
- At least more golden-y colored.
- Ssh!
- Hey, nice underpants.
(Groans)
I found this in my room.
You can have it.
Be warned, it's chatty.
Argh!
Well, what am I supposed to do with her?
Try asking your boss.
- You're short.
- Do you know anything about children?
No.
But I do carry a gun.
Let's go.
My daddy is James Hill.
I assumed as much.
You know why?
- Why?
- Because he's short, too.
You walk too fast.
You know your legs are longer than mine.
Can you get me some ice cream?
I have to say, it was a big surprise when your people reached out, Your Majesty.
I wasn't doing anything else, so I thought, 'What the hell?
'
- (Laughter)
- I hear you have a big secret announcement for us.
You may have noticed that my signature sideburns are gone.
It's because my hair's been falling out.
Male pattern baldness.
Comes hand in hand with er, erectile dysfunction.
- (Laughter)
- Yes, I have that, too.
Because I had a testicle removed.
You see, I have cancer.
(Gasps)
And it appears to be winning.
Why now?
Why tell the world like this, tonight?
Because there are people in the palace who think they can manipulate me with this information.
So I'd rather share it with the world than a precious few.
Takes their power away.
Are you hoping they'll feel more sentimental towards you and your reign?
Dear God, I hope not.
Most of my family are treacherous assholes.
- (Murmuring from audience)
- They hide behind fake smiles and loud charity, like a bunch of Hollywood actresses.
Well, the truth is they don't care about you.
They care about their image.
That and their billion-dollar empire.
The only true good person in that entire palace... was Violet.
And now she's gone, too.
So you can say what you want about me, and think what you'd like, but at least I'm honest with you.
Remember that when I'm gone.
Should be any day now.
(Birds cry)
Ah, Wilhelmina.
Your Majesty.
Do you prefer Wilhelmina or Willow?
- Willow is fine.
- Willow, good.
I prefer Your Majesty.
Walk with me.
I'm compelled by your understanding of social media.
How you manipulated a nation with hashtag 'King Liam.'
I merely planted the seed, Your Majesty.
Well, the seeds have blossomed nicely.
I'd like to hire you.
To do what, exactly?
Whatever it is you did and however it is you did it.
We're an archaic institution.
Liam's reign is going to need fresh ideas.
Liam's reign?
I'm going to prove that Liam is the legitimate heir to the throne.
And when I do, I want to make sure that the world insists that he become king.
Will you help me advance that message?
If I thought I could trust you, I would do this.
For Liam, because I do believe in him.
Then I guess you're hired, because you can trust me.
At least in regards to this.
And, Willow, the information about proving Liam's paternity, let's keep that off the face page for a bit, shall we?
(Exhales)
- What?
- Your eyebrows look like caterpillars.
Daddy!
I thought if I let you wander a bit, a man with sweets might trick you into his van or something.
Mr Caterpillar is taking care of me.
- Jasper.
- Can I go and see the princess again?
Fine.
Go.
Give your friend the caterpillar a rest.
- Jasper.
- He had a mean girlfriend named Sara once.
Now I'm his nice girlfriend.
Hey.
What are the rules?
No fire, no knives, and if anyone finds me, tell them I came from the womb of a jackal.
Perfect.
Be careful.
Okay, I will.
Bye, Jasper Caterpillar.
What are your intentions with my daughter?
Speaking of girlfriends, I understand you and the princess are getting closer?
How do you know that?
I'm the head of security.
Did you notice my new suit?
We're um, doing better.
Well, as pleased as I am for the both of you, and I am, have you considered what comes next?
The princess so much as glances at someone, it's headline news.
She holds their hand, it goes global.
If the public uncovers your relationship, the level of scrutiny would be unprecedented.
I'm not just talking about your accent.
I've got to go.
I'll do what I can to help.
Hang in there, kid.
'The only true good person in that entire palace... was Violet.
And now she's gone, too.'
(Sighs)
We're doing an assessment of the public's reaction to the news of his cancer.
And the rest of it.
At this rate he's going to kill the monarchy before cancer kills him.
We need to get into that lair of his and find some DNA.
Hair or toenails or a used condom.
Something!
He has his own guards stationed outside the room.
He rarely exits.
Most of the time he uses his double.
Do you trust James Hill, Your Majesty?
Is he Team Helena?
Yes, I believe he is.
Then as far as I'm concerned,
His Majesty just told us everything we need to secure your proof.
Tonight.
There's something you'd like to tell me?
Do you have any idea how dangerous that question is for me?
Word on the street...is that you're seeing other girls.
Sara Alice?
She seems to be quite smitten with you.
Well, can you blame her?
And anyway, we never said that we were exclusive.
Is that right?
A little cocky for a guy of your misdeeds.
I'll play along.
You're right, we never said we were exclusive.
But you do understand that that works both ways, yes?
- I understand that, yep.
- Good.
Good, good, good.
Good talk.
Go away.
I gave at the office.
It's James Hill, Your Majesty.
Er, your new head of security?
Little small for such a big job, aren't we, Biggie Smalls?
With all due respect, Your Majesty, the last guy was taller, but killed people.
And besides, Your Majesty seems to be accomplishing great things whilst being the opposite of tall.
Sucking up as opposed to simply sucking off will get you nowhere with me, Mr Hill.
What do you want?
I need you to come to my office so we can scan your retinas.
Forget it.
Bring it to me.
I'm afraid that's not possible, Your Majesty.
Well, then you won't be scanning my peepers, Hill.
I understand.
But should Your Majesty decide to leave the palace at some point in the future, including through the not-so-secret tunnels, we'll need your retinal scans on file.
I do apologize for the inconvenience.
Fine.
I'll be there when it suits me.
(Footsteps)
Hello, Liam.
I don't like the sound of that.
What?
I feel like I have hardly seen you lately.
I just...
Geez, what is up with you?
I'm...dealing with some stuff.
God, by letting it kick your ass?
Just...hold still.
What stuff?
I've been thinking a lot about Ted.
- Okay.
- He wasn't always a bad guy, you know.
He just...gave into the darkness and couldn't find his way back.
Okay, and what does that have to do with this?
I'm trying to find my way back.
Trying not to give in.
Do you want some advice?
Stop getting punched in the face.
Ted had a choice to make and so do you.
He chose darkness and you won't.
- Okay?
- Ow...
Right, so I was thinking, how'd you like to get out of town for the day and hang out with me?
The Electric Carnival is on.
Thanks, I think I'm just gonna lay low for a few days.
Come on.
We'll have a dance, couple of cocktails.
Jasper could be our security detail.
- Jasper?
- Sure, why not?
You guys hanging out again?
Non-exclusive by any chance?
Possibly.
Why?
You don't want to hang out with me, you want to make Jasper jealous.
That's ridiculous.
Fine, I want to make him jealous.
I do.
Jasper thinks that he can have the cow, and still drink from its teats.
- Not even close.
- You know what I mean.
I need to teach him a lesson so you have to come with me.
Plus, it will be fun, Liam.
Come on.
That's all you had to say.
Everyone's so deceitful around here.
Says the guy wearing make-up.
(Screaming)
(Clamoring)
Give us some dirt, Princess.
Who are you dating at the moment?
Er, no-one exclusively.
(Clicks tongue)
(Clamoring increases)
Prince Robert, when you first landed on the island, what were your initial thoughts?
I was hoping that the rescue would be successful.
I thought if I could simply stay coherent, keep myself visible, the search party would find me.
But when that storm kicked in and lasted for as long as it did,
I realized I'd be stranded for a bit.
At that point it was all about staying alive.
- Day by day.
- And how did you do that?
Did you have shelter or any supplies?
I had a military issue scabbard that belonged to my father,
I had a single flare and a small compass.
The rest I made up on the fly.
You survived for eight months with nothing but an antique knife?
My father's knife.
(ELEANOR) Is it true you chose to stay on the island?
They say you could have come home.
That there was a boat you could have signaled.
But you didn't.
Is that true, Robby?
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
(Clears throat) Excuse me, that's my table.
Charlie Madden.
It's a good thing we have security.
Hey, what up, Madden?
- Mwah!
- How are you doing, mate?
- Nice to see you.
How are you?
- Very well.
- I know you're not here solo.
- God, no.
My entire crew is here.
Most of them hoping to meet the princess.
And er, someone else you might know.
I didn't know you two knew each other.
We just met, actually.
And I thought you had better judgment.
- (Laughter)
- Buy you both a free drink?
- Yes, please.
- Alright.
I want to meet these friends, Madden.
- Patience.
- Immediately.
- Alright, Willow, this one's for you.
- Thank you.
Madden.
You need my eyes?
That's all you're getting.
- Make it quick, Hill.
- As you wish.
Please, sit here.
I'll prepare the scan.
We located a double that bears a striking resemblance to the king, as long as he doesn't have to speak.
Violet?
(Laughter)
You understand she's just trying to make you jealous?
- Yes.
- And?
It's working.
Come back?
Okay.
You want some advice?
Let her do her thing.
I know my sister.
It will completely infuriate her if you don't...
Violet?
Violet!
Violet!
Yes!
Oh, my God...
OMG, this is so exciting.
Good God, where did you find this guy?
Gay strip club.
Apparently he does quite well.
Hm, it's kinda tacky.
You're killing him, you realize that?
Mm.
We're just having fun.
He loves it.
He does not love it.
But let's say you make him jealous.
Then what?
Then he'll admit that he wants to be exclusive.
That's what you want?
To be exclusive?
No, I just want him to want to be exclusive.
Jasper has to admit that he wants me and only me before I can say the slightest thing about maybe possibly wanting him.
It's, like, Girl 101, dum-dum.
Mm!
Be glad your mother got out when she did, Willow.
You never have to deal with any of this madness.
Yeah, about that...
The Queen offered me a job in the palace today.
Doing what, exactly?
As best I can tell, she wants me to spend my days and nights saying nice things about you.
Tough job.
But if you think it might get in the way of our friendship, I won't take it.
We won't let that happen.
I think the monarchy is lucky to have you.
And so am I.
Although you do understand what a circus my family is?
They can't be that bad.
Nothing.
It's like the man's hairless cat.
- Rachel, anything?
- No, ma'am.
Mr Hoenigsberg?
(Sighs) I regret to say, not a thing, Your Majesty.
- (Groans)
- Would a testicle work?
Ah!
Vanity.
The enemy of wisdom and common sense.
Let's go.
(Cheering)
Hello, Jasper.
The boys I've been flirting with, they keep disappearing.
You wouldn't happen to know anything about that, would you?
No?
Okay, follow-up question.
This morning I had to cover my brother's cuts and bruises.
Is there anything you can tell me about that?
His Highness asked me not to.
Oh, is that right?
Well, is there anything that you can tell me?
I can tell you that the weight of what happened at the King's Cup has affected him a great deal.
A lot more than he thinks.
The burden of 'hashtag King Liam' makes him feel guilty, there's a girl he likes but he's trying to keep his distance, most likely to protect her, and I can tell you that he loves his sister very much.
Not very discreet, are you, Jasper?
No, I'm massively discreet.
But in this case I think you might be able to help him.
And besides, he's the brother of a girl I care about.
Well played.
(Clamoring)
Liam, I love you!
It's constant, isn't it?
The fascination with Len and you and your family.
Living life under the microscope, perpetual scrutiny.
You must want to...step away from it all sometimes.
Sometimes.
Truth is, from the moment I was born... it's never been an option.
You do a good job with it.
It was worse for Robert.
We could hide every now and then.
He was always in the spotlight.
(Woman whispering) What do you want?
(Breathing deeply)
(Excited screaming and yelling)
You okay?
I am.
Just been thinking about Robby.
I've been doing that a lot lately.
He'd be proud of you, you know.
I'm not so sure that's true.
Well, it is and you know it is.
I've been asking myself if I'm a good person lately.
- Because of Ted?
- Because of all kinds of things.
Well, the answer is 'Yes,' no matter what.
No matter what, okay?
- Can I tell you something?
- Yeah.
I want to be exclusive with Jasper.
But sometimes I feel like I'm not good enough and that my shit-show of a life isn't fair to him, so...
You understand he's a conman from Las Vegas who tried to rob you and slept with our mother?
And yet my life still seems messier.
He can handle it.
So can she.
The girl in your head.
Ever since Robby died, you have been as selfless as anyone I've ever known.
You put me first, put Mum first, Dad's legacy, all of it.
Put you first, Liam.
It's okay to be happy.
And to want someone who makes your heart race.
Your goodness?
It's easy to see.
You deserve to have whatever you want or whoever you want.
I promise, okay?
Same.
Yeah...
(Knock at door)
Come in.
- Hi.
- Hi.
No Liam again tonight?
No.
He asked for some time alone.
Is he going to need more make-up in the morning?
I think he's done with all that.
I hope so.
Can you unzip me, please?
- Did you have fun today?
- Not really, no.
Why not?
I think you know why not.
Didn't like the music?
Well, I thought it was a perfectly nice day.
Good music, nice friends.
Cute boys.
Not that it was exclusively about the cute boys, but I mean, it didn't hurt.
I think you've made your point.
What point?
Were you jealous?
You're goddamn right I was jealous.
I just spent the last 12 hours watching a bunch of douchebags hit on my...
I want to be with you.
You know I do, but I can never be sanctioned.
We can never have days like we had today together.
They'll find out about my past.
That's okay, I've done what I've done but they'll hold it against you and that's not okay.
I couldn't do that to you.
I never would.
Come with me.
600 years ago there was a royal.
A young queen, actually.
And she fell for her bodyguard.
Imagine that.
- Were they exclusive?
- Watch it.
They started this epic, earth-shattering love affair.
Quietly, secretly.
Quite scandalous, but it didn't matter to them.
And they would write the most romantic, aching love letters and hide them in a hollowed-out book.
This book.
Every time I enter this library I look inside... ..for a letter of my own.
It's not fair to you to ask you to have to settle for someone you'd have to hide from the world.
Who says I'd be settling?
So what happened to this queen and her bodyguard?
They got married.
They had two sons, who both did great things.
One of them was called Jasper.
Jasper Tudor.
You may have heard of them, the Tudors.
It's a true story.
You take my breath away, you know that?
Of course I do.
Maybe you should try writing that down sometime.
Hi.
Hi.
I wanted to see you.
From the time I was born, I was taught not to say what I was thinking, not to listen to my heart, but tonight I want to tell the truth.
It's what I should have done the first moment I saw you.
Yeah, but you didn't.
And, yes, when you texted me, my heart skipped a beat.
But I can think of a million reasons why we can't do this.
I can think of one big reason...
My heart is a disaster.
My head's even worse and I know this isn't easy for you.
But I want you, and I know you feel it too.
Oh, Liam...
Kiss me and then tell me if I should stay or go.
Stay.
You tricked me!
Yes, I did.
What have I ever done to you?
You should pour yourself a drink, Cyrus.
My answer will take a while.
All these years I stood by you.
I conspired with you.
And look where it got you.
Your face is on our currency.
Your head wears a crown.
You were a footnote.
Now you're a king.
You're welcome.
Don't be so certain about those results.
It's not like you kept your legs closed.
And even if the little bastards are Simon's, you think I'm giving up my reign without a fight?
I'm a dying man with sovereign immunity and nothing to lose.
So, you'd better watch your back... ..bitch.
Wake up.
Time to go home.
I'm not asleep.
Did you have a good day at the palace?
Uh-huh.
I did all kinds of things.
What did you do today, Daddy?
Do you remember when you were a little girl and you said, "Help them, Daddy"?
That's what I did today.
And that's what I'll do tomorrow.
Until they can help themselves?
Until they can help themselves.
* The fight you pick
* Is misunderstood
* I'll never be one to try and hurt you for good
* Burn out...
I'm doing better, Dad.
I just wanted you to know.
* You keep me awake
* In waves of unwavering storm
* But I'll say you can love me
* You can love me
* You can love me if you really want it
* You have a choice
* You have a choice
* You have a choice
* You have a choice
* Waves and waves of anger
* Are reflected in your eyes
* Reflective of what chances
* Have fallen by the way
* Side by side and endless
* Let's never fall apart
What do you want?
* No-one to break your heart
* Whoa-oh-oh
* Whoa-oh-oh-oh
* Whoa-oh-oh
* Whoa-oh-oh-oh
* Whoa-oh-oh
* Whoa-oh-oh-oh
* Whoa-oh
* Whoa-oh...
* Hey!
* Hey!
'Previously on The Royals...'
I will find Simon's body and when I do,
Liam and Eleanor's paternity will be verified and you'll be replaced.
No Simon, no DNA, no paternity.
We have an opening for the King's head of security.
I'd like it to be you.
Can't remember the last time I went this long without having sex.
Maybe I could arrange a little service call for Your Majesty.
It's a pleasure to finally meet our new Lord Chamberlain.
Violet, I love you.
'I'm sorry I messed up.'
Jasper.
I've decided to forgive you.
- For what?
- All of it.
Hashtag, 'King Liam Movement.'
I'd like to know where it started.
Better still, who started it.
You will find that taking a life is an unbearable weight.
Sorry, we're shut.
I thought about you a lot.
I should have done more for you.
(CLAMORING OF PEOPLE)
(MULTIPLE QUESTIONS BEING SHOUTED)
Prince Robert, how did you survive on the island?
Were you scared?
Describe the moment you knew you were in peril.
Did you think you were going to die?
(CLAMORING RESUMES)
- Hi.
- Hello.
Are you a princess?
- That's what they tell me.
- Where's your crown?
I don't sleep in the crown.
It's too pointy.
Do you have one?
- I suppose I do, yeah.
- How about glass slippers?
I'm a princess, not Cinderella.
- What about a prince?
- What about it?
- Do you have one?
- Well, define 'prince.'
You know, like a boy who likes you and rides a white horse and kisses you awake sometimes.
I have several princes, yeah.
I'm not too sure about the white horse part.
Okay, good.
See you later.
Bye.
Wait!
(GROANS) Who are you, exactly, again?
Oh.
I'm called Sara Alice.
You can call me Sara or Alice.
Or whatever you want, considering you're a princess.
I appreciate that.
Thank you.
(GROANS)
- Ooh, is that fairy dust?
- Stop!
That's... poison from the evil Queen.
- You know the story.
- I do know all about it, yes.
Good.
Well, don't ever touch that.
- Whoever you are.
- Sara Alice.
Yes, of course.
You said that.
Right...
Are you sure you're a princess?
I'm pretty sure, yeah.
Why?
Did you swallow some of the wicked Queen's poison?
I think some got in my nose, yeah.
I can tell.
You don't look very princess-y.
That's very nice.
Come on, let's go,
Sara Alice in the palace.
Heel!
I'm not a dog, but I'd love to have one.
Daddy says I'm allergic to dogs, cats, and horses.
Right... (KATHRYN) How's the hangover?
(GIGGLES)
I feel like a pack of wild dogs dragged me through the streets.
You look like it, too.
Here.
- Thanks.
- Cup of tea isn't too much to ask before the motorcade steals you away.
- You know the story.
- I do.
I erm, put my number in your phone.
You know, in case you find yourself drunk or once again cornered by rabid dogs.
- How have you been, Kathryn?
- I've been okay.
- Keeping busy.
- Yeah.
Same.
Not the same kind of busyness at all.
The rest of it's the same.
- Last time I saw you...
- We took that picture.
I remember.
For what it's worth, you look good.
Thanks.
You, not so much.
Thanks for the tea.
Erm, you got your phone?
Wallet, keys?
I don't have keys.
I'm a prince.
Yes, you certainly are.
We always have to remember that.
No, you always have to remember that.
Thank you.
It really is wonderful to see you.
Go.
I have to list your cup on eBay.

At 11:00am, Your Majesty has an audience with Her Majesty Queen Letizia of Spain regarding the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization.
I took the liberty of including some background materials as they pertain to Her Majesty's work as special ambassador for nutrition.
At 1300, you have a luncheon and tea with several members of the League of Women for the Preservation of London.
(GROANS) Those bitches are relentless.
Very well.
In the future, I like to know the menu in advance for my lunches.
Yes, ma'am.
This afternoon's main course will be the smoked salmon with lemon butter and watercress.
And if I may suggest the Oolong Formosa tea.
Fermented tea from Taiwan, featuring an attractive amber hue, a gentle multi-taste, yet a robust and fully-developed aroma.
- Anything else?
- You'll look pretty in the pink one.
Strictly professional, Mr Hoenigsberg.
Of course.

Shouldn't you be wearing a crown right now?
At least a ribbon in your hair.
- (GROANS)
- Isn't your hair supposed to be blonde?
- Ssh!
- At least more golden-y colored.
- Ssh!
- Hey, nice underpants.
(GROANS)
I found this in my room.
You can have it.
Be warned, it's chatty.
Argh!
Well, what am I supposed to do with her?
Try asking your boss.
- You're short.
- Do you know anything about children?
No.
But I do carry a gun.
Let's go.
My daddy is James Hill.
I assumed as much.
You know why?
- Why?
- Because he's short, too.
You walk too fast.
You know your legs are longer than mine.
Can you get me some ice cream?
I have to say, it was a big surprise when your people reached out, Your Majesty.
I wasn't doing anything else, so I thought, 'What the hell?
'
(LAUGHTER)
I hear you have a big secret announcement for us.
You may have noticed that my signature sideburns are gone.
It's because my hair's been falling out.
Male pattern baldness.
Comes hand in hand with er, erectile dysfunction.
- (LAUGHTER)
- Yes, I have that, too.
Because I had a testicle removed.
You see, I have cancer.
(GASPS)
And it appears to be winning.
Why now?
Why tell the world like this, tonight?
Because there are people in the palace who think they can manipulate me with this information.
So I'd rather share it with the world than a precious few.
Takes their power away.
Are you hoping they'll feel more sentimental towards you and your reign?
Dear God, I hope not.
Most of my family are treacherous assholes.
(MURMURING FROM AUDIENCE)
They hide behind fake smiles and loud charity, like a bunch of Hollywood actresses.
Well, the truth is they don't care about you.
They care about their image.
That and their billion-dollar empire.
The only true good person in that entire palace... was Violet.
And now she's gone, too.
So you can say what you want about me, and think what you'd like, but at least I'm honest with you.
Remember that when I'm gone.
Should be any day now.
(BIRDS CRY)
Ah, Wilhelmina.
Your Majesty.
Do you prefer Wilhelmina or Willow?
- Willow is fine.
- Willow, good.
I prefer Your Majesty.
Walk with me.
I'm compelled by your understanding of social media.
How you manipulated a nation with hashtag 'King Liam.'
I merely planted the seed, Your Majesty.
Well, the seeds have blossomed nicely.
I'd like to hire you.
To do what, exactly?
Whatever it is you did and however it is you did it.
We're an archaic institution.
Liam's reign is going to need fresh ideas.
Liam's reign?
I'm going to prove that Liam is the legitimate heir to the throne.
And when I do, I want to make sure that the world insists that he become king.
Will you help me advance that message?
If I thought I could trust you, I would do this.
For Liam, because I do believe in him.
Then I guess you're hired, because you can trust me.
At least in regards to this.
And, Willow, the information about proving Liam's paternity, let's keep that off the face page for a bit, shall we?
(EXHALES)
- What?
- Your eyebrows look like caterpillars.
Daddy!
I thought if I let you wander a bit, a man with sweets might trick you into his van or something.
Mr Caterpillar is taking care of me.
- Jasper.
- Can I go and see the princess again?
Fine.
Go.
Give your friend the caterpillar a rest.
Jasper.
He had a mean girlfriend named Sara once.
Now I'm his nice girlfriend.
Hey.
What are the rules?
No fire, no knives, and if anyone finds me, tell them I came from the womb of a jackal.
Perfect.
Be careful.
Okay, I will.
Bye, Jasper Caterpillar.
What are your intentions with my daughter?
Speaking of girlfriends, I understand you and the princess are getting closer?
How do you know that?
I'm the head of security.
Did you notice my new suit?
We're um, doing better.
Well, as pleased as I am for the both of you, and I am, have you considered what comes next?
The princess so much as glances at someone, it's headline news.
She holds their hand, it goes global.
If the public uncovers your relationship, the level of scrutiny would be unprecedented.
I'm not just talking about your accent.
I've got to go.
I'll do what I can to help.
Hang in there, kid.
'The only true good person in that entire palace... was Violet.
And now she's gone, too.'
(SIGHS)
We're doing an assessment of the public's reaction to the news of his cancer.
And the rest of it.
At this rate he's going to kill the monarchy before cancer kills him.
We need to get into that lair of his and find some DNA.
Hair or toenails or a used condom.
Something!
He has his own guards stationed outside the room.
He rarely exits.
Most of the time he uses his double.
Do you trust James Hill, Your Majesty?
Is he Team Helena?
Yes, I believe he is.
Then as far as I'm concerned,
His Majesty just told us everything we need to secure your proof.
Tonight.
There's something you'd like to tell me?
Do you have any idea how dangerous that question is for me?
Word on the street... is that you're seeing other girls.
Sara Alice?
She seems to be quite smitten with you.
Well, can you blame her?
And anyway, we never said that we were exclusive.
Is that right?
A little cocky for a guy of your misdeeds.
I'll play along.
You're right, we never said we were exclusive.
But you do understand that that works both ways, yes?
- I understand that, yep.
- Good.
Good, good, good.
Good talk.
Go away.
I gave at the office.
It's James Hill, Your Majesty.
Er, your new head of security?
Little small for such a big job, aren't we, Biggie Smalls?
With all due respect, Your Majesty, the last guy was taller, but killed people.
And besides, Your Majesty seems to be accomplishing great things whilst being the opposite of tall.
Sucking up as opposed to simply sucking off will get you nowhere with me, Mr Hill.
What do you want?
I need you to come to my office so we can scan your retinas.
Forget it.
Bring it to me.
I'm afraid that's not possible, Your Majesty.
Well, then you won't be scanning my peepers, Hill.
I understand.
But should Your Majesty decide to leave the palace at some point in the future, including through the not-so-secret tunnels, we'll need your retinal scans on file.
I do apologize for the inconvenience.
Fine.
I'll be there when it suits me.
(FOOTSTEPS)
Hello, Liam.
I don't like the sound of that.
What?
I feel like I have hardly seen you lately.
I just...
Geez, what is up with you?
I'm... dealing with some stuff.
God, by letting it kick your ass?
Just... hold still.
What stuff?
I've been thinking a lot about Ted.
- Okay.
- He wasn't always a bad guy, you know.
He just... gave into the darkness and couldn't find his way back.
Okay, and what does that have to do with this?
I'm trying to find my way back.
Trying not to give in.
Do you want some advice?
Stop getting punched in the face.
Ted had a choice to make and so do you.
He chose darkness and you won't.
- Okay?
- Ow...
Right, so I was thinking, how'd you like to get out of town for the day and hang out with me?
The Electric Carnival is on.
Thanks, I think I'm just gonna lay low for a few days.
Come on.
We'll have a dance, couple of cocktails.
Jasper could be our security detail.
- Jasper?
- Sure, why not?
You guys hanging out again?
Non-exclusive by any chance?
Possibly.
Why?
You don't want to hang out with me, you want to make Jasper jealous.
That's ridiculous.
Fine, I want to make him jealous.
I do.
Jasper thinks that he can have the cow, and still drink from its teats.
- Not even close.
- You know what I mean.
I need to teach him a lesson so you have to come with me.
Plus, it will be fun, Liam.
Come on.
That's all you had to say.
Everyone's so deceitful around here.
Says the guy wearing make-up.
(SCREAMING)
(CLAMORING)
Give us some dirt, Princess.
Who are you dating at the moment?
Er, no-one exclusively.
(CLICKS TONGUE)
(CLAMORING INCREASES)
Prince Robert, when you first landed on the island, what were your initial thoughts?
I was hoping that the rescue would be successful.
I thought if I could simply stay coherent, keep myself visible, the search party would find me.
But when that storm kicked in and lasted for as long as it did,
I realized I'd be stranded for a bit.
At that point it was all about staying alive.
- Day by day.
- And how did you do that?
Did you have shelter or any supplies?
I had a military issue scabbard that belonged to my father,
I had a single flare and a small compass.
The rest I made up on the fly.
You survived for eight months with nothing but an antique knife?
My father's knife.
(ELEANOR) Is it true you chose to stay on the island?
They say you could have come home.
That there was a boat you could have signaled.
But you didn't.
Is that true, Robby?
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
(CLEARS THROAT) Excuse me, that's my table.
Charlie Madden.
It's a good thing we have security.
Hey, what up, Madden?
- Mwah!
- How are you doing, mate?
- Nice to see you.
How are you?
- Very well.
- I know you're not here solo.
- God, no.
My entire crew is here.
Most of them hoping to meet the princess.
And er, someone else you might know.
I didn't know you two knew each other.
We just met, actually.
And I thought you had better judgment.
- (LAUGHTER)
- Buy you both a free drink?
- Yes, please.
- Alright.
I want to meet these friends, Madden.
- Patience.
- Immediately.
- Alright, Willow, this one's for you.
- Thank you.
Madden.
You need my eyes?
That's all you're getting.
- Make it quick, Hill.
- As you wish.
Please, sit here.
I'll prepare the scan.
We located a double that bears a striking resemblance to the king, as long as he doesn't have to speak.
Violet?
(LAUGHTER)
You understand she's just trying to make you jealous?
- Yes.
- And?
It's working.
Come back?
Okay.
You want some advice?
Let her do her thing.
I know my sister.
It will completely infuriate her if you don't...
Violet?
Violet!
Violet!
Yes!
Oh, my God...
OMG, this is so exciting.
Good God, where did you find this guy?
Gay strip club.
Apparently he does quite well.
Hm, it's kinda tacky.
You're killing him, you realize that?
Mm.
We're just having fun.
He loves it.
He does not love it.
But let's say you make him jealous.
Then what?
Then he'll admit that he wants to be exclusive.
That's what you want?
To be exclusive?
No, I just want him to want to be exclusive.
Jasper has to admit that he wants me and only me before I can say the slightest thing about maybe possibly wanting him.
It's, like, Girl 101, dum-dum.
Mm!
Be glad your mother got out when she did, Willow.
You never have to deal with any of this madness.
Yeah, about that...
The Queen offered me a job in the palace today.
Doing what, exactly?
As best I can tell, she wants me to spend my days and nights saying nice things about you.
Tough job.
But if you think it might get in the way of our friendship, I won't take it.
We won't let that happen.
I think the monarchy is lucky to have you.
And so am I.
Although you do understand what a circus my family is?
They can't be that bad.
Nothing.
It's like the man's hairless cat.
- Rachel, anything?
- No, ma'am.
Mr Hoenigsberg?
(SIGHS) I regret to say, not a thing, Your Majesty.
- (GROANS)
- Would a testicle work?
Ah!
Vanity.
The enemy of wisdom and common sense.
Let's go.
(CHEERING)
Hello, Jasper.
The boys I've been flirting with, they keep disappearing.
You wouldn't happen to know anything about that, would you?
No?
Okay, follow-up question.
This morning I had to cover my brother's cuts and bruises.
Is there anything you can tell me about that?
His Highness asked me not to.
Oh, is that right?
Well, is there anything that you can tell me?
I can tell you that the weight of what happened at the King's Cup has affected him a great deal.
A lot more than he thinks.
The burden of 'hashtag King Liam' makes him feel guilty, there's a girl he likes but he's trying to keep his distance, most likely to protect her, and I can tell you that he loves his sister very much.
Not very discreet, are you, Jasper?
No, I'm massively discreet.
But in this case I think you might be able to help him.
And besides, he's the brother of a girl I care about.
Well played.
(CLAMORING)
Liam, I love you!
It's constant, isn't it?
The fascination with Len and you and your family.
Living life under the microscope, perpetual scrutiny.
You must want to... step away from it all sometimes.
Sometimes.
Truth is, from the moment I was born... it's never been an option.
You do a good job with it.
It was worse for Robert.
We could hide every now and then.
He was always in the spotlight.
(WOMAN WHISPERING) What do you want?
(BREATHING DEEPLY)
(EXCITED SCREAMING AND YELLING)
You okay?
I am.
Just been thinking about Robby.
I've been doing that a lot lately.
He'd be proud of you, you know.
I'm not so sure that's true.
Well, it is and you know it is.
I've been asking myself if I'm a good person lately.
- Because of Ted?
- Because of all kinds of things.
Well, the answer is 'Yes, ' no matter what.
No matter what, okay?
- Can I tell you something?
- Yeah.
I want to be exclusive with Jasper.
But sometimes I feel like I'm not good enough and that my shit-show of a life isn't fair to him, so...
You understand he's a conman from Las Vegas who tried to rob you and slept with our mother?
And yet my life still seems messier.
He can handle it.
So can she.
The girl in your head.
Ever since Robby died, you have been as selfless as anyone I've ever known.
You put me first, put Mum first, Dad's legacy, all of it.
Put you first, Liam.
It's okay to be happy.
And to want someone who makes your heart race.
Your goodness?
It's easy to see.
You deserve to have whatever you want or whoever you want.
I promise, okay?
Same.
Yeah...
(KNOCK AT DOOR)
Come in.
- Hi.
- Hi.
No Liam again tonight?
No.
He asked for some time alone.
Is he going to need more make-up in the morning?
I think he's done with all that.
I hope so.
Can you unzip me, please?
- Did you have fun today?
- Not really, no.
Why not?
I think you know why not.
Didn't like the music?
Well, I thought it was a perfectly nice day.
Good music, nice friends.
Cute boys.
Not that it was exclusively about the cute boys, but I mean, it didn't hurt.
I think you've made your point.
What point?
Were you jealous?
You're goddamn right I was jealous.
I just spent the last 12 hours watching a bunch of douchebags hit on my...
I want to be with you.
You know I do, but I can never be sanctioned.
We can never have days like we had today together.
They'll find out about my past.
That's okay, I've done what I've done but they'll hold it against you and that's not okay.
I couldn't do that to you.
I never would.
Come with me.
600 years ago there was a royal.
A young queen, actually.
And she fell for her bodyguard.
Imagine that.
- Were they exclusive?
- Watch it.
They started this epic, earth-shattering love affair.
Quietly, secretly.
Quite scandalous, but it didn't matter to them.
And they would write the most romantic, aching love letters and hide them in a hollowed-out book.
This book.
Every time I enter this library I look inside... ..for a letter of my own.
It's not fair to you to ask you to have to settle for someone you'd have to hide from the world.
Who says I'd be settling?
So what happened to this queen and her bodyguard?
They got married.
They had two sons, who both did great things.
One of them was called Jasper.
Jasper Tudor.
You may have heard of them, the Tudors.
It's a true story.
You take my breath away, you know that?
Of course I do.
Maybe you should try writing that down sometime.
Hi.
Hi.
I wanted to see you.
From the time I was born, I was taught not to say what I was thinking, not to listen to my heart, but tonight I want to tell the truth.
It's what I should have done the first moment I saw you.
Yeah, but you didn't.
And, yes, when you texted me, my heart skipped a beat.
But I can think of a million reasons why we can't do this.
I can think of one big reason...
My heart is a disaster.
My head's even worse and I know this isn't easy for you.
But I want you, and I know you feel it too.
Oh, Liam...
Kiss me and then tell me if I should stay or go.
Stay.
You tricked me!
Yes, I did.
What have I ever done to you?
You should pour yourself a drink, Cyrus.
My answer will take a while.
All these years I stood by you.
I conspired with you.
And look where it got you.
Your face is on our currency.
Your head wears a crown.
You were a footnote.
Now you're a king.
You're welcome.
Don't be so certain about those results.
It's not like you kept your legs closed.
And even if the little bastards are Simon's, you think I'm giving up my reign without a fight?
I'm a dying man with sovereign immunity and nothing to lose.
So, you'd better watch your back... ..bitch.
Wake up.
Time to go home.
I'm not asleep.
Did you have a good day at the palace?
Uh-huh.
I did all kinds of things.
What did you do today, Daddy?
Do you remember when you were a little girl and you said, "Help them, Daddy"?
That's what I did today.
And that's what I'll do tomorrow.
Until they can help themselves?
Until they can help themselves.
I'm doing better, Dad.
I just wanted you to know.
I need your advice on these wedding invites.
I like calligraphy option number two;
it looks like a Bone Thugs album.
This looks like an ad for a bong company.
I like option one better.
WINSTON:
You know what would be nice?
A wedding invitation engraved on a plate.
(chuckling)
What a magical wedding that would be.
You two are imbeciles.
Anybody with taste and sophistication would always choose option number two.
NICK:
Are you okay?
You look gray.
I didn't sleep.
I was up preparing for an epic day of wedding decisions.
I'm calling it D-Day.
Of course, in this situation, the "D" stands for "decisions,"
and unlike the other D-Day, it will not be a walk on the beach.
That's incredibly offensive.
- I know.
- (door closes)
(shrieks)
Do you guys remember that audition I had for gas station TV?
Well, the girl they hired went missing
- and they need me to fill in!
- Yeah!
- What?
- Oh!
- JESS:
Oh, my God, we're gonna be friends with a gas celebrity!
That's right!
But it is today, and I know you need my help with the wedding stuff...
Cece, what are you talking about?
Are you crazy?
You have to go to this.
I can do it all by my... by myself.
Are you okay?
(yawns)
Wow, your mouth has been open forever.
Okay, this is crazy.
I'm just gonna stay home.
- No, Cece, you have to go, please.
- It's... it's...
- Okay.
- I'll be fine.
I'll be fine.
I can help with wedding stuff.
Just lighten the load a little bit.
Sometimes I think
I was bred in a lab to help people.
You know what else they bred in the lab?
Pugs.
Thank you, Jess.
That would be great.
Uh, no, Cece.
I don't have time to bring her up to speed.
Throwing her into the fray now would be like putting a baby on a treadmill.
She would... just shoot off.
Baby, you're just being protective of the wedding, okay?
Jess is just gonna help.
She's not gonna take over.
Mmm...
Jess...
Mmm... mm... mm... mmm.
What's happening here?
Fine.
Who's excited?
There we go.
Ooh, FYI, you may have to wrestle a rectal nutrient into him.
- Wait, what?
- You're right.
Not your job.
I've done it before.
I mean, I didn't like it, but...
I did it.
Am I proud of it?
No.
Did I do it?
Yes.
Have I done it again since?
No.
There's tons to do today, so we're going to have to split up.
I have to be here for a tux fitting and a meeting with a napkin ring genius.
Gonna be fine.
There's chairs to be picked and... (yawns) ...cakes to be tasted.
Schmidt?
Are you asleep?
What?
!
No, I'm not sleeping, of course I'm not sleeping!
Just tons... too much to do today to sleep.
Jess... this is the most important thing that I own.
It is the wedding flash drive.
Everything that you need to know is on this.
It's color-coded.
Ooh, color-coded.
Gimme.
Please do not reach for it like you're Winston reaching for someone's breast.
Treat it with respect.
I will, and I just want to say
I'm honored you're trusting me.
Oh, I'm not.
SCHMIDT:
Everything I see is terrible.
Pan left.
JESS:
This one's nice.
Comfortable, but not too comfortable.
- We want people to dance.
- Folding chairs?
Jess, if I wanted my wedding to be an AA meeting,
I would've called my Aunt Terry.
I don't think you want to marry this guy.
Who is that?
(Nick taps rhythmically on bar)
♪
Oh, finally.
Winston, where have you been?
I've been waiting an hour.
Work was crazy, okay?
I busted a poker room, which was a front for a crack house, which was a front for a brothel.
It was a crime turducken.
This is the third time you've stood me up.
Meat lunch is our oldest and proudest tradition.
Let's do this every year for the rest of our lives.
I'm gonna be a lawyer.
Let's eat.
I can't.
I had an hour, I gotta go back to work.
I mean...
You know, it's a... it's a bar in the middle of the day.
Like, who's there?
Why are they there?
Why do you need to be there?
'Cause it's my job.
It runs itself.
It's basically a big-ass fridge.
I'm a bartender and owner.
You know how many balls I have to juggle now?
Man, those are baby balls.
- Hmm.
- I'm a cop.
I spend my day working the city's balls.
- Listen to yourself.
- Those balls are big.
Listen to yourself.
I'm listening to myself, Nick.
Your balls, in comparison to my balls, that you have to deal with, that I have to handle...
If you think your job is so much harder than my job, then why don't you come see for yourself?
Unless, of course, you're scared.
- Scared?
- Scared.
I'm a cop.
I run a bar.
Welcome to the nerve center.
Over here, you've got accounts payable... bills, to the layperson... and over here is the schedule.
It's a numbers game, really.
Who works when and why, square pegs, round holes, every man is a mystery...
That's great, Nick.
Um, I'm a cop.
(laughs)
- (knocking at door)
- Come in!
Hey, Nick, what's the schedule for the weekend?
NICK:
Oh, great, everybody's here.
Why don't you ask my friend Winston?
He'll be handling all questions.
Yeah, that's easy.
JESS:
All right.
I'm ready to taste cakes.
Okay, great.
- This is gonna be fun.
- I'm sorry, fun?
Baking scones with Winston is fun.
This is serious, Jess.
Mmm!
Soft and sweet.
What a relief it's not hard and salty.
How is the nose?
Does it have a clean finish, or would you say it's a long cake?
Describe the cake's legs in terms of mouth feel.
Bro, I spent two hours at the chair place.
You picked nothing.
You negotiated with the florist until all three of us were crying.
Let's start again and put the camera close to the frosting.
And for God's sakes, please, be mindful of your friggin' shadow.
No.

Great!
It's exactly like modeling, except for it's less cold and I get to talk.
How's Schmidt?
He's not stress-eating paper towels again, is he?
No, everything's fine.
I'm supposed to see a beverage guy, but I can't find his address.
Seriously?
I can come back and help.
- No!
- It's fine.
It's just...
Schmidt has this color-coded system, and I can't figure out which one.
Do you know which one beverages would be?
I don't know.

You're a genius.
I found it.
Okay, I gotta go learn Spanish.

I told him that I know it.
Oh.
Good luck.
Gavin, wine sales, Calabasas.

I didn't do it!
I'm lying.
I obviously did it.
Don't worry.
We just put those there for people to break.
- Really?
- No, they were very expensive.
But I own the place, so why don't we say this one broke, too?
I'm Gavin.
Let's try this one.
Tempting, but my friends are getting married.
I'm kind of on a deadline.
And also I prefer my wine sparkling, pink and under $11.

Just taste it.
Okay, one glass.
Javier, you take the early shift on...
Saturday.
- Ugh.
- Come on, listen,
I got to do what I got to do, you know?
Uh, Gina, wait to induce until Sunday... afternoon.
Gina, don't you have something on Sunday?
My husband has his fantasy baseball league.
He won't attend the birth if it doesn't happen.
That's not the man you should be with, I'm sorry.
All right, where do you want these?
Winston, where do we want these?
Where do we want...?
Winston?
No, dude.
I don't know you like that, man.
Put 'em where the beer goes.
Come on, man, I got eight more deliveries.
Look, I don't like the early shift.
- (disgruntled chattering)
- Mercy?
Yes!
Yes, yes, man.
That's what I thought.
Cheese, the keg's gonna go where it always goes, right behind the bar.
Guys, the schedule.
- Oh, that's perfect.
Thanks.
- That works?
Back to work, everybody.
Good stuff.
WINSTON:
Listen, I get it.
This is confusing and everything, and I can't just walk in off the street and do your job instantaneously.
But come on.
Let's be real.
It's still not harder than being a cop.
- Then prove it.
- Oh, I'll prove it.
Look, I know I told you to prove it, but I got to get back to the bar.
I just got a text from Javier that said,
"fire extinguisher" question mark.
Well, all I got to say is, buckle up, Miller.
It's about to be a bumpy ride.

Uh, where...
where are my sunglasses?
How the hell should I know?
I specifically asked you to keep track of my sunglasses.
And I told you I'm not your freaking mother.
Okay, you know what, calm down, I'll just squint then.
Do what you got to do, man.
Is this how all partners talk to each other?

Welcome to hell, Miller.
I'm no good at normal life, but when I'm in the ocean and drinking wine or spending time with a beautiful stranger... (giggles) ...that's when I, uh, truly feel like myself.
Mmm.
Mm-hmm.
How do you feel about a little manchego?
I feel very good about it.
We're not animals.

You need better labels.

Chairs are color-coded under chartreuse, because it sounds like "chair truths."
Salmon mongers are filed under fuchsia, because I "re-fuchsia" to serve salmon at this wedding.

Okay, why don't we take this horrible, horrible, gross mistake into something positive?
What if this is a sign that maybe you should reach out and talk to your dad again?
Why?
Why would I talk to my dad?
He left my mom and basically missed my entire childhood.
And every time I did invite him to something, he never showed up:
middle school graduation, high school graduation, when I played the titular role in a stage adaptation of Uncle Buck.
Well, he's taken up surfing now.
Oh, he's taken up surfing?
How nice.
A middle-aged man who surfs and French-kisses his customers.
What a hero.
Why did you have his number in the wedding drive at all?
Because I was maybe... warming up to the idea of inviting him, but now that the nightmare called "this afternoon" has happened,
I can very well see that I'm not ready.
So I'm sorry, Jess, but there will be no papa nah-nah at the wedding for you.
I'm sorry!
He was feeding me cheese, and I...
- I d...
Ugh.
- Please stop.
- Please.
So many details.
- Please.
- And-and God for... if you...
- Just... if the words "he unbuttoned my" comes out of your mouth,
I'm gonna freak out!
Oh, thank God, Winston.
You're saving the city from a palm frond.
Los Angeles can sleep soundly tonight, everybody.
All right, it was a slow-ass day.
Aly, will you tell him it's a slow-ass day?
No, I'm not getting involved in this.
I'm not gonna be the yardstick in a penis measuring contest.
Did you say "yard"?
Wow, who are you dating?
Tape measure, fine.
Okay, look, this has been great, uh, but I got to get back to the bar.
DISPATCHER: 7-8-6-3.
Possible 4-5-9 at 2-7-3 Elm Cross and Fairbanks.
Hell yes.
4-2-4 responding.
Over.
Bar boy, get in.
Aly, let's lock and load.
Is your gun not loaded?
You have to load your gun, Winston.
(knocking on door)
Oh, no.
Schmidt, um, that's your dad.
BOTH:
What?
What-what is my dad doing at our front door?
He thinks we're going on a date.
Why would he think that, Jess?
Because I said, "Let's go on a date."
I'll get rid of him.
Go to your room and close the door.
Do not tell me what to do; you are not my mom.
- (gasps)
- Oh, that's disgusting.
Just go.
Go.
Wait.
Wait, wait.
I don't trust you.

Hey, Gavin!
NICK:
I know what this is.
I'm not falling for it.
You don't have to stage a crime to make your job look hard.
Stay here.
Make yourself as small a target as possible.
I'll just be here napping out of boredom.
WINSTON (on radio):
I see signs of forced entry.
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
I got movement!
I'm shaking in my boots!
Oh, yeah, right, he's ru...
No!
ALY:
Halt!
Police!
(shouting)
(screaming)
Aah!
No!
Get away!
Get out!
(Taser buzzing, man screaming)
Okay, I get it!
Your job is way harder than mine!
Just make the bad man go away!
- What?
- Put the gun down!
- Yeah, my job is much harder!
- (screams)
- We're gonna make him go away!
- (Nick shouting)
Can't stand to see Nick like this, you know.
At least now, he understands being a cop is much harder than being a bartender.
We all got to learn that lesson sometime.
Idiot, he doesn't think his job is harder.
He just wants you to see that he's grown and changed and whatever else stupid stuff people care about.
Oh.
(quiet laugh)
Why are you looking at me like that?
No, no, I... (stammers)
That's why I need my damn sunglasses, man!
You shouldn't have them if you can't keep track of them, Winston.
Come on, yeah.
- No!
No!
- Hey, scoot over.
No, not in here!
Not in here, no!
No!
- You have the right to remain silent.
- No!
No!
GAVIN:
What are you doing with a video camera on your head?
He is handsome.
- JESS:
That's a good question.
- Oh, hey, look.
That's-that's good news for you, okay.
- It's for work.
- I still hate him.
They want to make sure that we don't teach evolution.
I'm an educator, so...
Oh, you told me.
I believe you had me pressed up against a cask of Merlot at the time.
(groans) He's a bottom?
You want to give me the tour?
Or should we just crack this open and make out?
What a line.
Who is this clown?
- Bottle opener in here?
- Well... oh.
Oh, actually, um, change of plans...
I can't go on a date tonight, because I have to have dinner with one of my friends' fathers, coincidentally.
No pressure.
It's just that I had a lot of fun today.
And, uh,
I'd like to see you again.
(shouts)
- What was that?
- Oh.
Gunshots... the neighborhood's in a real slide.
This is my son's name.
7 billion people.
There's got to be some overlap.
We'd better get you back to Calabasas, mister.
- Wait a minute.
- 'Cause...
This is my son!
Oh, my God, do you know my son?
Kind of.
- Does he live here?
- Uh...
Is he here right now?
I didn't know you were Schmidt's dad when we kissed.
And you didn't know I was his roommate.
And those are facts that will haunt us forever.
(chuckles)
But I can't let you go in there.
Because... he's not ready to see you.
- And for once today, I...
- Okay.
I want to respect his wishes.
I get it.
Um, wait, wait, wait, wait.
- No, I'll go.
- Wait, wait.
What?
He's in there.
Shh.
She told him.
Son?
- Babe, I think you should watch.
- I don't...
- Son.
- You should watch.
I know you're mad.
I get it.
Do you want me to take this off?
I didn't do a good job being your father.
You're in a zone.
I'm just gonna sit tight.
And now you're getting married.
I get it.
I wouldn't have invited me, either.
I've missed a lot.
I'm sorry.
In my defense,
I was stoned for most of the '90s.
And the 2000s.
Full disclosure...
I was stoned this morning.
I like weed.
But the point is, if you can forgive me even a little,
I'd love to have a drink with you.
And meet the man that you've become.
Come on.
Gavin.
That's okay...
Gavin, not Dad.
That's just where I'm at right now.
Understood.
I'm grateful you're calling me anything at all.
I wanted to say I'm sorry.
And I know that it might not seem genuine, because the only reason I came here today was to do stuff with your roommate.
(groans) But in the past ten years,
I must've picked up that phone to call you and apologize a hundred times.
I really am sorry.
Gavin, this is my fiancée Cece.
She is the reason that I am the man that I am today.
It's wonderful to meet you, Cece.
I'm the terrible father.
Thank you.
Because whatever you did or didn't do,
Schmidt turned out amazing.
All right.
I'm gonna head out.
I'm sure it will be a beautiful wedding.
I wasn't very good at being married.
But thankfully you seem like you're nothing like me.
For what it's worth,
I like the second option.
Timeless.
I agree.
Good-bye.
Okay, wa... uh... (clears his throat)
Wait, uh...
Here, that's for you.
Let's see if you can show up this time.
I hope that you do.
Thank you.
There's no plus one, so don't even ask.
I'll be there.
(sighs)
Back to square one on the seating chart.
Oh!
Sorry, I'm a little bit jumpy.
God, they should really make a TV show based off what you guys do.
You know, I've been telling that to Aly since forever!
It'd be a great idea.
Hello, Hollywood!
It's a big show!
Yeah, it's a hit.
I want to apologize.
I'm sorry that I thought my job was harder than yours.
It's not.
I'm just making schedules and buying beer.
Look, man. (chuckles)
The whole thing has been pretty idiotic.
You know, uh, my job is harder than yours.
Yes, that's a fact.
We all know it.
But I got to say, man, this is first time
I've seen you really care about your job.
- (chuckles)
- You're killing it.
It means a lot to me that you said that.
- So thank you.
- Yeah, yeah.
So, look, I got...
I got us burgers.
- Oh!
- You know,
I figured we're both too busy for steak.
- (both laugh)
- The tradition!
Nick, I need a drink.
It'd better be green, sweet and in a fun glass.
Schmidt, are you okay?
I mean, you look a little freaked...
Oh... oh-oh, Cece!
Cece's pregnant!
- No.
- Ow.
Jess made out with Schmidt's dad.
Oh, my God!
So many emotions.
♪ Got an old hound dog ♪
♪ Bobby Joe is his name ♪
♪ Got an old hound dog... ♪
Well, I mean, did you like it?
- Don't answer that.
- Ew, it was Schmidt's dad.
You're not answering the question.
No, she's not answering the question.
Sweetie, you don't have to say anything.
I liked it a little bit.
- (guys groaning, clamoring)
- Dude.
I need your advice on these wedding invites.
I like calligraphy option number two;
it looks like a Bone Thugs album.
This looks like an ad for a bong company.
I like option one better.
You know what would be nice?
A wedding invitation engraved on a plate.
What a magical wedding that would be.
You two are imbeciles.
Anybody with taste and sophistication would always choose option number two.
Are you okay?
You look gray.
I didn't sleep.
I was up preparing for an epic day of wedding decisions.
I'm calling it D-Day.
Of course, in this situation, the "D" stands for "decisions,"
and unlike the other D-Day, it will not be a walk on the beach.
That's incredibly offensive.
I know.
Do you guys remember that audition I had for gas station TV?
Well, the girl they hired went missing
- and they need me to fill in!
- Yeah!
- What?
- Oh!
- Oh, my God, we're gonna be friends with a gas celebrity!
That's right!
But it is today, and I know you need my help with the wedding stuff...
Cece, what are you talking about?
Are you crazy?
You have to go to this.
I can do it all by my... by myself.
Are you okay?
Wow, your mouth has been open forever.
Okay, this is crazy.
I'm just gonna stay home.
- No, Cece, you have to go, please.
- It's... it's...
- Okay.
- I'll be fine.
I'll be fine.
I can help with wedding stuff.
Just lighten the load a little bit.
Sometimes I think
I was bred in a lab to help people.
You know what else they bred in the lab?
Pugs.
Thank you, Jess.
That would be great.
Uh, no, Cece.
I don't have time to bring her up to speed.
Throwing her into the fray now would be like putting a baby on a treadmill.
She would... just shoot off.
Baby, you're just being protective of the wedding, okay?
Jess is just gonna help.
She's not gonna take over.
Mmm...
Jess...
Mmm... mm... mm... mmm.
What's happening here?
Fine.
Who's excited?
There we go.
Ooh, FYI, you may have to wrestle a rectal nutrient into him.
- Wait, what?
- You're right.
Not your job.
I've done it before.
I mean, I didn't like it, but...
I did it.
Am I proud of it?
No.
Did I do it?
Yes.
Have I done it again since?
No.
There's tons to do today, so we're going to have to split up.
I have to be here for a tux fitting and a meeting with a napkin ring genius.
Gonna be fine.
There's chairs to be picked and cakes to be tasted.
Schmidt?
Are you asleep?
What?
!
No, I'm not sleeping, of course I'm not sleeping!
Just tons... too much to do today to sleep.
Jess... this is the most important thing that I own.
It is the wedding flash drive.
Everything that you need to know is on this.
It's color-coded.
Ooh, color-coded.
Gimme.
Please do not reach for it like you're Winston reaching for someone's breast.
Treat it with respect.
I will, and I just want to say
I'm honored you're trusting me.
Oh, I'm not.
Everything I see is terrible.
Pan left.
This one's nice.
Comfortable, but not too comfortable.
- We want people to dance.
- Folding chairs?
Jess, if I wanted my wedding to be an AA meeting,
I would've called my Aunt Terry.
I don't think you want to marry this guy.
Who is that?
Oh, finally.
Winston, where have you been?
I've been waiting an hour.
Work was crazy, okay?
I busted a poker room, which was a front for a crack house, which was a front for a brothel.
It was a crime turducken.
This is the third time you've stood me up.
Meat lunch is our oldest and proudest tradition.
Let's do this every year for the rest of our lives.
I'm gonna be a lawyer.
Let's eat.
I can't.
I had an hour, I gotta go back to work.
I mean...
You know, it's a... it's a bar in the middle of the day.
Like, who's there?
Why are they there?
Why do you need to be there?
'Cause it's my job.
It runs itself.
It's basically a big-ass fridge.
I'm a bartender and owner.
You know how many balls I have to juggle now?
Man, those are baby balls.
- Hmm.
- I'm a cop.
I spend my day working the city's balls.
- Listen to yourself.
- Those balls are big.
Listen to yourself.
I'm listening to myself, Nick.
Your balls, in comparison to my balls, that you have to deal with, that I have to handle...
If you think your job is so much harder than my job, then why don't you come see for yourself?
Unless, of course, you're scared.
- Scared?
- Scared.
I'm a cop.
I run a bar.
Welcome to the nerve center.
Over here, you've got accounts payable... bills, to the layperson... and over here is the schedule.
It's a numbers game, really.
Who works when and why, square pegs, round holes, every man is a mystery...
That's great, Nick.
Um, I'm a cop.
Come in!
Hey, Nick, what's the schedule for the weekend?
Oh, great, everybody's here.
Why don't you ask my friend Winston?
He'll be handling all questions.
Yeah, that's easy.
All right.
I'm ready to taste cakes.
Okay, great.
- This is gonna be fun.
- I'm sorry, fun?
Baking scones with Winston is fun.
This is serious, Jess.
Mmm!
Soft and sweet.
What a relief it's not hard and salty.
How is the nose?
Does it have a clean finish, or would you say it's a long cake?
Describe the cake's legs in terms of mouth feel.
Bro, I spent two hours at the chair place.
You picked nothing.
You negotiated with the florist until all three of us were crying.
Let's start again and put the camera close to the frosting.
And for God's sakes, please, be mindful of your friggin' shadow.
No.
I'm stopping this.
You're stop... you're stopping what?
J-Jess?
What are... what are you doing?
Why am I looking at a fountain now?
What...
What a relaxing water feature.
Are they playing Christina there?
Hey, gal pal, how is it going?
Great!
It's exactly like modeling, except for it's less cold and I get to talk.
How's Schmidt?
He's not stress-eating paper towels again, is he?
No, everything's fine.
I'm supposed to see a beverage guy, but I can't find his address.
Seriously?
I can come back and help.
- No!
- It's fine.
It's just...
Schmidt has this color-coded system, and I can't figure out which one.
Do you know which one beverages would be?
I don't know.
Blue?
You're a genius.
I found it.
Okay, I gotta go learn Spanish.
I told him that I know it.
Oh.
Good luck.
Gavin, wine sales, Calabasas.
_
I didn't do it!
I'm lying.
I obviously did it.
Don't worry.
We just put those there for people to break.
- Really?
- No, they were very expensive.
But I own the place, so why don't we say this one broke, too?
I'm Gavin.
Let's try this one.
Tempting, but my friends are getting married.
I'm kind of on a deadline.
And also I prefer my wine sparkling, pink and under $11.
Just taste it.
Okay, one glass.
Javier, you take the early shift on...
Saturday.
- Ugh.
- Come on, listen,
I got to do what I got to do, you know?
Uh, Gina, wait to induce until Sunday... afternoon.
Gina, don't you have something on Sunday?
My husband has his fantasy baseball league.
He won't attend the birth if it doesn't happen.
That's not the man you should be with, I'm sorry.
All right, where do you want these?
Winston, where do we want these?
Where do we want...?
Winston?
No, dude.
I don't know you like that, man.
Put 'em where the beer goes.
Come on, man, I got eight more deliveries.
Look, I don't like the early shift.
Mercy?
Yes!
Yes, yes, man.
That's what I thought.
Cheese, the keg's gonna go where it always goes, right behind the bar.
Guys, the schedule.
- Oh, that's perfect.
Thanks.
- That works?
Back to work, everybody.
Good stuff.
Listen, I get it.
This is confusing and everything, and I can't just walk in off the street and do your job instantaneously.
But come on.
Let's be real.
It's still not harder than being a cop.
- Then prove it.
- Oh, I'll prove it.
Look, I know I told you to prove it, but I got to get back to the bar.
I just got a text from Javier that said,
"fire extinguisher" question mark.
Well, all I got to say is, buckle up, Miller.
It's about to be a bumpy ride.
Uh, where... where are my sunglasses?
How the hell should I know?
I specifically asked you to keep track of my sunglasses.
And I told you I'm not your freaking mother.
Okay, you know what, calm down, I'll just squint then.
Do what you got to do, man.
Is this how all partners talk to each other?
Welcome to hell, Miller.
I'm no good at normal life, but when I'm in the ocean and drinking wine or spending time with a beautiful stranger that's when I, uh, truly feel like myself.
Mmm.
Mm-hmm.
How do you feel about a little manchego?
I feel very good about it.
We're not animals.
Or maybe we are.
Have you ever...?
Hmm?
I have too much manchego.
Happens to the best of us.
Have you ever had your eyebrows combed by a woman you just met?
Yes.
Ah.
Jess, thank you.
You know, I haven't had two hours of uninterrupted sleep since a month ago when Cece made me watch An Inconvenient Truth.
Everything's under control.
The bakery's sending over
- three cakes for you to try.
- Okay.
And Gavin from the winery in Calabasas gave me a great deal.
Uh, you met Gavin in Calabasas?
I didn't just meet him, we kissed a little.
No!
Ugh!
Schmidt, what happened?
What's wrong?
You just made out with my dad.
Schmidt.
Can I just say one thing?
Hey, guys.
So, how did it go today?
Good.
We got a lot accomplished.
But, um... how do I say this?
Um...
I made out with Schmidt's dad.
You did what?
She lulled me to sleep and then went rogue.
- You did what?
- If your files had been clearly marked, none of this would be happening.
You need better labels.
Everything is perfectly clear.
Chairs are color-coded under chartreuse, because it sounds like "chair truths."
Salmon mongers are filed under fuchsia, because I "re-fuchsia" to serve salmon at this wedding.
The groomsmen tuxes are under magenta, because "ma-gentlemen" will be wearing the dope tuxes.
Is he a good kisser?
Don't ask that, plea...
And don't you answer it.
It's withdrawn.
I'm just freaking out right now.
Okay, why don't we take this horrible, horrible, gross mistake into something positive?
What if this is a sign that maybe you should reach out and talk to your dad again?
Why?
Why would I talk to my dad?
He left my mom and basically missed my entire childhood.
And every time I did invite him to something, he never showed up:
middle school graduation, high school graduation, when I played the titular role in a stage adaptation of Uncle Buck.
Well, he's taken up surfing now.
Oh, he's taken up surfing?
How nice.
A middle-aged man who surfs and French-kisses his customers.
What a hero.
Why did you have his number in the wedding drive at all?

I will, and I just want to say
I'm honored you're trusting me.
Oh, I'm not.
Everything I see is terrible.
Pan left.
This one's nice.
Comfortable, but not too comfortable.
- We want people to dance.
- Folding chairs?
Jess, if I wanted my wedding to be an AA meeting,
I would've called my Aunt Terry.
I don't think you want to marry this guy.
Who is that?
Oh, finally.
Winston, where have you been?
I've been waiting an hour.
Work was crazy, okay?
I busted a poker room, which was a front for a crack house, which was a front for a brothel.
It was a crime turducken.
This is the third time you've stood me up.
Meat lunch is our oldest and proudest tradition.
Let's do this every year for the rest of our lives.
I'm gonna be a lawyer.
Let's eat.
I can't.
I had an hour, I gotta go back to work.
I mean...
You know, it's a... it's a bar in the middle of the day.
Like, who's there?
Why are they there?
Why do you need to be there?
'Cause it's my job.
It runs itself.
It's basically a big-ass fridge.
I'm a bartender and owner.
You know how many balls I have to juggle now?
Man, those are baby balls.
- Hmm.
- I'm a cop.
I spend my day working the city's balls.
- Listen to yourself.
- Those balls are big.
Listen to yourself.
I'm listening to myself, Nick.
Your balls, in comparison to my balls, that you have to deal with, that I have to handle...
If you think your job is so much harder than my job, then why don't you come see for yourself?
Unless, of course, you're scared.
- Scared?
- Scared.
I'm a cop.
I run a bar.
Welcome to the nerve center.
Over here, you've got accounts payable... bills, to the layperson... and over here is the schedule.
It's a numbers game, really.
Who works when and why, square pegs, round holes, every man is a mystery...
That's great, Nick.
Um, I'm a cop.
Come in!
Hey, Nick, what's the schedule for the weekend?
Oh, great, everybody's here.
Why don't you ask my friend Winston?
He'll be handling all questions.
Yeah, that's easy.
All right.
I'm ready to taste cakes.
Okay, great.
- This is gonna be fun.
- I'm sorry, fun?
Baking scones with Winston is fun.
This is serious, Jess.
Mmm!
Soft and sweet.
What a relief it's not hard and salty.
How is the nose?
Does it have a clean finish, or would you say it's a long cake?
Describe the cake's legs in terms of mouth feel.
Bro, I spent two hours at the chair place.
You picked nothing.
You negotiated with the florist until all three of us were crying.
Let's start again and put the camera close to the frosting.
And for God's sakes, please, be mindful of your friggin' shadow.
No.
I'm stopping this.
You're stop... you're stopping what?
J-Jess?
What are... what are you doing?
Why am I looking at a fountain now?
What...
What a relaxing water feature.
Are they playing Christina there?
Hey, gal pal, how is it going?
Great!
It's exactly like modeling, except for it's less cold and I get to talk.
How's Schmidt?
He's not stress-eating paper towels again, is he?
No, everything's fine.
I'm supposed to see a beverage guy, but I can't find his address.
Seriously?
I can come back and help.
- No!
- It's fine.
It's just...
Schmidt has this color-coded system, and I can't figure out which one.
Do you know which one beverages would be?
I don't know.
Blue?
You're a genius.
I found it.
Okay, I gotta go learn Spanish.
I told him that I know it.
Oh.
Good luck.
Gavin, wine sales, Calabasas.
_
I didn't do it!
I'm lying.
I obviously did it.
Don't worry.
We just put those there for people to break.
- Really?
- No, they were very expensive.
But I own the place, so why don't we say this one broke, too?
I'm Gavin.
Let's try this one.
Tempting, but my friends are getting married.
I'm kind of on a deadline.
And also I prefer my wine sparkling, pink and under $11.
Just taste it.
Okay, one glass.
Javier, you take the early shift on...
Saturday.
- Ugh.
- Come on, listen,
I got to do what I got to do, you know?
Uh, Gina, wait to induce until Sunday... afternoon.
Gina, don't you have something on Sunday?
My husband has his fantasy baseball league.
He won't attend the birth if it doesn't happen.
That's not the man you should be with, I'm sorry.
All right, where do you want these?
Winston, where do we want these?
Where do we want...?
Winston?
No, dude.
I don't know you like that, man.
Put 'em where the beer goes.
Come on, man, I got eight more deliveries.
Look, I don't like the early shift.
Mercy?
Yes!
Yes, yes, man.
That's what I thought.
Cheese, the keg's gonna go where it always goes, right behind the bar.
Guys, the schedule.
- Oh, that's perfect.
Thanks.
- That works?
Back to work, everybody.
Good stuff.
Listen, I get it.
This is confusing and everything, and I can't just walk in off the street and do your job instantaneously.
But come on.
Let's be real.
It's still not harder than being a cop.
- Then prove it.
- Oh, I'll prove it.
Look, I know I told you to prove it, but I got to get back to the bar.
I just got a text from Javier that said,
"fire extinguisher" question mark.
Well, all I got to say is, buckle up, Miller.
It's about to be a bumpy ride.
Uh, where... where are my sunglasses?
How the hell should I know?
I specifically asked you to keep track of my sunglasses.
And I told you I'm not your freaking mother.
Okay, you know what, calm down, I'll just squint then.
Do what you got to do, man.
Is this how all partners talk to each other?
Welcome to hell, Miller.
I'm no good at normal life, but when I'm in the ocean and drinking wine or spending time with a beautiful stranger that's when I, uh, truly feel like myself.
Mmm.
Mm-hmm.
How do you feel about a little manchego?
I feel very good about it.
We're not animals.
Or maybe we are.
Have you ever...?
Hmm?
I have too much manchego.
Happens to the best of us.
Have you ever had your eyebrows combed by a woman you just met?
Yes.
Ah.
Jess, thank you.
You know, I haven't had two hours of uninterrupted sleep since a month ago when Cece made me watch An Inconvenient Truth.
Everything's under control.
The bakery's sending over
- three cakes for you to try.
- Okay.
And Gavin from the winery in Calabasas gave me a great deal.
Uh, you met Gavin in Calabasas?
I didn't just meet him, we kissed a little.
No!
Ugh!
Schmidt, what happened?
What's wrong?
You just made out with my dad.
Schmidt.
Can I just say one thing?
Hey, guys.
So, how did it go today?
Good.
We got a lot accomplished.
But, um... how do I say this?
Um...
I made out with Schmidt's dad.
You did what?
She lulled me to sleep and then went rogue.
- You did what?
- If your files had been clearly marked, none of this would be happening.
You need better labels.
Everything is perfectly clear.
Chairs are color-coded under chartreuse, because it sounds like "chair truths."
Salmon mongers are filed under fuchsia, because I "re-fuchsia" to serve salmon at this wedding.
The groomsmen tuxes are under magenta, because "ma-gentlemen" will be wearing the dope tuxes.
Is he a good kisser?
Don't ask that, plea...
And don't you answer it.
It's withdrawn.
I'm just freaking out right now.
Okay, why don't we take this horrible, horrible, gross mistake into something positive?
What if this is a sign that maybe you should reach out and talk to your dad again?
Why?
Why would I talk to my dad?
He left my mom and basically missed my entire childhood.
And every time I did invite him to something, he never showed up:
middle school graduation, high school graduation, when I played the titular role in a stage adaptation of Uncle Buck.
Well, he's taken up surfing now.
Oh, he's taken up surfing?
How nice.
A middle-aged man who surfs and French-kisses his customers.
What a hero.
Why did you have his number in the wedding drive at all?
Because I was maybe... warming up to the idea of inviting him, but now that the nightmare called "this afternoon" has happened,
I can very well see that I'm not ready.
So I'm sorry, Jess, but there will be no papa nah-nah at the wedding for you.
I'm sorry!
He was feeding me cheese, and I...
- I d...
Ugh.
- Please stop.
- Please.
So many details.
- Please.
- And-and God for... if you...
- Just... if the words "he unbuttoned my" comes out of your mouth,
I'm gonna freak out!
Oh, thank God, Winston.
You're saving the city from a palm frond.
Los Angeles can sleep soundly tonight, everybody.
All right, it was a slow-ass day.
Aly, will you tell him it's a slow-ass day?
No, I'm not getting involved in this.
I'm not gonna be the yardstick in a penis measuring contest.
Did you say "yard"?
Wow, who are you dating?
Tape measure, fine.
Okay, look, this has been great, uh, but I got to get back to the bar.
7-8-6-3.
Possible 4-5-9 at 2-7-3 Elm Cross and Fairbanks.
Hell yes.
4-2-4 responding.
Over.
Bar boy, get in.
Aly, let's lock and load.
Is your gun not loaded?
You have to load your gun, Winston.
Oh, no.
Schmidt, um, that's your dad.
What?
What-what is my dad doing at our front door?
He thinks we're going on a date.
Why would he think that, Jess?
Because I said, "Let's go on a date."
I'll get rid of him.
Go to your room and close the door.
Do not tell me what to do; you are not my mom.
Oh, that's disgusting.
Just go.
Go.
Wait.
Wait, wait.
I don't trust you.
Hey, Gavin!
I know what this is.
I'm not falling for it.
You don't have to stage a crime to make your job look hard.
Stay here.
Make yourself as small a target as possible.
I'll just be here napping out of boredom.
I see signs of forced entry.
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
I got movement!
I'm shaking in my boots!
Oh, yeah, right, he's ru...
No!
Halt!
Police!
Aah!
No!
Get away!
Get out!
Okay, I get it!
Your job is way harder than mine!
Just make the bad man go away!
- What?
- Put the gun down!
Yeah, my job is much harder!
We're gonna make him go away!
Can't stand to see Nick like this, you know.
At least now, he understands being a cop is much harder than being a bartender.
We all got to learn that lesson sometime.
Idiot, he doesn't think his job is harder.
He just wants you to see that he's grown and changed and whatever else stupid stuff people care about.
Oh.
Why are you looking at me like that?
No, no, I...
That's why I need my damn sunglasses, man!
You shouldn't have them if you can't keep track of them, Winston.
Come on, yeah.
- No!
No!
- Hey, scoot over.
No, not in here!
Not in here, no!
No!
- You have the right to remain silent.
- No!
No!
What are you doing with a video camera on your head?
He is handsome.
- That's a good question.
- Oh, hey, look.
That's-that's good news for you, okay.
- It's for work.
- I still hate him.
They want to make sure that we don't teach evolution.
I'm an educator, so...
Oh, you told me.
I believe you had me pressed up against a cask of Merlot at the time.
He's a bottom?
You want to give me the tour?
Or should we just crack this open and make out?
What a line.
Who is this clown?
- Bottle opener in here?
- Well... oh.
Oh, actually, um, change of plans...
I can't go on a date tonight, because I have to have dinner with one of my friends' fathers, coincidentally.
No pressure.
It's just that I had a lot of fun today.
And, uh,
I'd like to see you again.
- What was that?
- Oh.
Gunshots... the neighborhood's in a real slide.
This is my son's name.
7 billion people.
There's got to be some overlap.
We'd better get you back to Calabasas, mister.
- Wait a minute.
- 'Cause...
This is my son!
Oh, my God, do you know my son?
Kind of.
- Does he live here?
- Uh...
Is he here right now?
I didn't know you were Schmidt's dad when we kissed.
And you didn't know I was his roommate.
And those are facts that will haunt us forever.
But I can't let you go in there.
Because... he's not ready to see you.
- And for once today, I...
- Okay.
I want to respect his wishes.
I get it.
Um, wait, wait, wait, wait.
- No, I'll go.
- Wait, wait.
What?
He's in there.
Shh.
She told him.
Son?
- Babe, I think you should watch.
- I don't...
- Son.
- You should watch.
I know you're mad.
I get it.
Do you want me to take this off?
I didn't do a good job being your father.
You're in a zone.
I'm just gonna sit tight.
And now you're getting married.
I get it.
I wouldn't have invited me, either.
I've missed a lot.
I'm sorry.
In my defense,
I was stoned for most of the '90s.
And the 2000s.
Full disclosure...
I was stoned this morning.
I like weed.
But the point is, if you can forgive me even a little,
I'd love to have a drink with you.
And meet the man that you've become.
Come on.
Gavin.
That's okay...
Gavin, not Dad.
That's just where I'm at right now.
Understood.
I'm grateful you're calling me anything at all.
I wanted to say I'm sorry.
And I know that it might not seem genuine, because the only reason I came here today was to do stuff with your roommate.
But in the past ten years,
I must've picked up that phone to call you and apologize a hundred times.
I really am sorry.
Gavin, this is my fiancée Cece.
She is the reason that I am the man that I am today.
It's wonderful to meet you, Cece.
I'm the terrible father.
Thank you.
Because whatever you did or didn't do,
Schmidt turned out amazing.
All right.
I'm gonna head out.
I'm sure it will be a beautiful wedding.
I wasn't very good at being married.
But thankfully you seem like you're nothing like me.
For what it's worth,
I like the second option.
Timeless.
I agree.
Good-bye.
Okay, wa... uh...
Wait, uh...
Here, that's for you.
Let's see if you can show up this time.
I hope that you do.
Thank you.
There's no plus one, so don't even ask.
I'll be there.
Back to square one on the seating chart.
Oh!
Sorry, I'm a little bit jumpy.
God, they should really make a TV show based off what you guys do.
You know, I've been telling that to Aly since forever!
It'd be a great idea.
Hello, Hollywood!
It's a big show!
Yeah, it's a hit.
I want to apologize.
I'm sorry that I thought my job was harder than yours.
It's not.
I'm just making schedules and buying beer.
Look, man.
The whole thing has been pretty idiotic.
You know, uh, my job is harder than yours.
Yes, that's a fact.
We all know it.
But I got to say, man, this is first time
I've seen you really care about your job.
You're killing it.
It means a lot to me that you said that.
- So thank you.
- Yeah, yeah.
So, look, I got...
I got us burgers.
- Oh!
- You know,
I figured we're both too busy for steak.
The tradition!
Nick, I need a drink.
It'd better be green, sweet and in a fun glass.
Schmidt, are you okay?
I mean, you look a little freaked...
Oh... oh-oh, Cece!
Cece's pregnant!
- No.
- Ow.
Jess made out with Schmidt's dad.
Oh, my God!
So many emotions.
Well, I mean, did you like it?
- Don't answer that.
- Ew, it was Schmidt's dad.
You're not answering the question.
No, she's not answering the question.
Sweetie, you don't have to say anything.
I liked it a little bit.
Dude.
I need your advice on these wedding invites.
I like calligraphy option number two;
it looks like a Bone Thugs album.
This looks like an ad for a bong company.
I like option one better.
WINSTON:
You know what would be nice?
A wedding invitation engraved on a plate.
(chuckling)
What a magical wedding that would be.
You two are imbeciles.
Anybody with taste and sophistication would always choose option number two.
NICK:
Are you okay?
You look gray.
I didn't sleep.
I was up preparing for an epic day of wedding decisions.
I'm calling it D-Day.
Of course, in this situation, the "D" stands for "decisions,"
and unlike the other D-Day, it will not be a walk on the beach.
That's incredibly offensive.
- I know.
- (door closes)
(shrieks)
Do you guys remember that audition I had for gas station TV?
Well, the girl they hired went missing
- and they need me to fill in!
- Yeah!
- What?
- Oh!
- JESS:
Oh, my God, we're gonna be friends with a gas celebrity!
That's right!
But it is today, and I know you need my help with the wedding stuff...
Cece, what are you talking about?
Are you crazy?
You have to go to this.
I can do it all by my... by myself.
Are you okay?
(yawns)
Wow, your mouth has been open forever.
Okay, this is crazy.
I'm just gonna stay home.
- No, Cece, you have to go, please.
- It's... it's...
- Okay.
- I'll be fine.
I'll be fine.
I can help with wedding stuff.
Just lighten the load a little bit.
Sometimes I think
I was bred in a lab to help people.
You know what else they bred in the lab?
Pugs.
Thank you, Jess.
That would be great.
Uh, no, Cece.
I don't have time to bring her up to speed.
Throwing her into the fray now would be like putting a baby on a treadmill.
She would... just shoot off.
Baby, you're just being protective of the wedding, okay?
Jess is just gonna help.
She's not gonna take over.
Mmm...
Jess...
Mmm... mm... mm... mmm.
What's happening here?
Fine.
Who's excited?
There we go.
Ooh, FYI, you may have to wrestle a rectal nutrient into him.
- Wait, what?
- You're right.
Not your job.
I've done it before.
I mean, I didn't like it, but...
I did it.
Am I proud of it?
No.
Did I do it?
Yes.
Have I done it again since?
No.
There's tons to do today, so we're going to have to split up.
I have to be here for a tux fitting and a meeting with a napkin ring genius.
Gonna be fine.
There's chairs to be picked and... (yawns) ...cakes to be tasted.
Schmidt?
Are you asleep?
What?
!
No, I'm not sleeping, of course I'm not sleeping!
Just tons... too much to do today to sleep.
Jess... this is the most important thing that I own.
It is the wedding flash drive.
Everything that you need to know is on this.
It's color-coded.
Ooh, color-coded.
Gimme.
Please do not reach for it like you're Winston reaching for someone's breast.
Treat it with respect.
I will, and I just want to say
I'm honored you're trusting me.
Oh, I'm not.
SCHMIDT:
Everything I see is terrible.
Pan left.
JESS:
This one's nice.
Comfortable, but not too comfortable.
- We want people to dance.
- Folding chairs?
Jess, if I wanted my wedding to be an AA meeting,
I would've called my Aunt Terry.
I don't think you want to marry this guy.
Who is that?

I'm no good at normal life, but when I'm in the ocean and drinking wine or spending time with a beautiful stranger... (giggles) ...that's when I, uh, truly feel like myself.
Mmm.
Mm-hmm.
How do you feel about a little manchego?
I feel very good about it.
We're not animals.
(chuckles) Or maybe we are.
(both laugh)
Have you ever...?
Hmm?
(both laugh)
I have too much manchego.
Happens to the best of us.
Have you ever had your eyebrows combed by a woman you just met?
Yes.

(door opens)
Ah.
Jess, thank you.
You know, I haven't had two hours of uninterrupted sleep since a month ago when Cece made me watch An Inconvenient Truth.
Everything's under control.
The bakery's sending over
- three cakes for you to try.
- Okay.
And Gavin from the winery in Calabasas gave me a great deal.
Uh, you met Gavin in Calabasas?
I didn't just meet him, we kissed a little.
(shrieking)
No!
Ugh!
Schmidt, what happened?
What's wrong?
(whispering):
You just made out with my dad.
(shrieking)
Schmidt.
(shushing)
Can I just say one thing?
(shushing)
(door opens)
Hey, guys.
So, how did it go today?
Good.
We got a lot accomplished.
But, um... how do I say this?
Um...
I made out with Schmidt's dad.
You did what?
She lulled me to sleep and then went rogue.
- You did what?
- If your files had been clearly marked, none of this would be happening.
You need better labels.
SCHMIDT:
Everything is perfectly clear.
Chairs are color-coded under chartreuse, because it sounds like "chair truths."
Salmon mongers are filed under fuchsia, because I "re-fuchsia" to serve salmon at this wedding.
The groomsmen tuxes are under magenta, because "ma-gentlemen" will be wearing the dope tuxes.
Is he a good kisser?
Don't ask that, plea...
And don't you answer it.
(stammers) It's withdrawn.
I'm just freaking out right now.
Okay, why don't we take this horrible, horrible, gross mistake into something positive?
What if this is a sign that maybe you should reach out and talk to your dad again?
Why?
Why would I talk to my dad?
He left my mom and basically missed my entire childhood.
And every time I did invite him to something, he never showed up:
middle school graduation, high school graduation, when I played the titular role in a stage adaptation of Uncle Buck.
Well, he's taken up surfing now.
Oh, he's taken up surfing?
How nice.
A middle-aged man who surfs and French-kisses his customers.
What a hero.
Why did you have his number in the wedding drive at all?
Because I was maybe... warming up to the idea of inviting him, but now that the nightmare called "this afternoon" has happened,
I can very well see that I'm not ready.
So I'm sorry, Jess, but there will be no papa nah-nah at the wedding for you.
I'm sorry!
He was feeding me cheese, and I...
- I d...
Ugh.
- Please stop.
- Please.
So many details.
- Please.
- And-and God for... if you...
- Just... if the words "he unbuttoned my" comes out of your mouth,
I'm gonna freak out!

All right, it was a slow-ass day.
Aly, will you tell him it's a slow-ass day?
No, I'm not getting involved in this.
I'm not gonna be the yardstick in a penis measuring contest.
Did you say "yard"?
Wow, who are you dating?
Tape measure, fine.
Okay, look, this has been great, uh, but I got to get back to the bar.

BOTH:
What?
What-what is my dad doing at our front door?
He thinks we're going on a date.
Why would he think that, Jess?
Because I said, "Let's go on a date."
I'll get rid of him.
Go to your room and close the door.

I'd like to see you again.

Kind of.

I wouldn't have invited me, either.
I've missed a lot.
I'm sorry.
In my defense,
I was stoned for most of the '90s.
And the 2000s.
Full disclosure...
I was stoned this morning.
I like weed.
But the point is, if you can forgive me even a little,
I'd love to have a drink with you.
And meet the man that you've become.
Come on.
Gavin.
That's okay...
Gavin, not Dad.
That's just where I'm at right now.
Understood.
I'm grateful you're calling me anything at all.
I wanted to say I'm sorry.
And I know that it might not seem genuine, because the only reason I came here today was to do stuff with your roommate.
(groans) But in the past ten years,
I must've picked up that phone to call you and apologize a hundred times.
I really am sorry.
Gavin, this is my fiancée Cece.
She is the reason that I am the man that I am today.
It's wonderful to meet you, Cece.
I'm the terrible father.
Thank you.
Because whatever you did or didn't do,
Schmidt turned out amazing.
All right.
I'm gonna head out.
I'm sure it will be a beautiful wedding.
I wasn't very good at being married.
But thankfully you seem like you're nothing like me.
For what it's worth,
I like the second option.
Timeless.
I agree.
Good-bye.
Okay, wa... uh... (clears his throat)
Wait, uh...

Hello, Hollywood!

I want to apologize.
I'm sorry that I thought my job was harder than yours.
It's not.
I'm just making schedules and buying beer.
Look, man. (chuckles)
The whole thing has been pretty idiotic.
You know, uh, my job is harder than yours.
Yes, that's a fact.

It means a lot to me that you said that.

This just means that I can do it the way that I want it.
Whatever you say.
Look, I'm going to meet a friend for a...
- PHONE BEEPS - "granola and kale falafel".
God, how Shoreditch has changed.
Can I trust you with this?
Of course I can trust you with this.
TENSE MUSIC
I've just sat down.
I'm going out with Rachel later.
I need the answers now.
Have you paid into my gaming account?
Yes, you ridiculous nerd.
OK.
The first steps you take in breaking down the formula...
SHE HUMS
A... night... full... of promise.
I wonder if that's what prom means...
RUMBLING
Weird.
- Like this?
- Yeah, exactly.
Isn't this great?
The two of us... talking about something other than what the white people are doing.
You tell anyone about this, you're dead.
I mean dead.
RUMBLING
What was that?
No, is it promenade?
Hm...
TENSE MUSIC
Help!
There's nothing.
What did you see?
Was it a shadow?
What do you know about shadows?
RUMBLING
- Tanya!
- Ram!
Help!
Anyone?
!
SHE GROANS
SHE BREATHES HEAVILY
We're in terrible danger.
No, I'm telling you, I'm seeing it right now.
There's someone attacking her!
- SHE GROANS
- Wait...
What?
Tanya, what's your address?
I don't know!
Something with a 3 in it.
I think you know what waits for you here.
You think the same plan will work!
But I am what waits for you.
And I am war itself!
Run.
- Where is the prince?
- Prince?
The singer?
Oh, shit!
Shit!
I can't use the gun, but you can do it, please!
More lights, Tanya.
Get rid of all the shadows.
Well, obviously!
SHE SCREAMS
No!
- No, please!
No!
- No!
It's part of your shadow!
Just shoot it!
Shoot it now, or it'll kill us both!
- April, no!
- HE GROANS
Did you kill it?
I don't...
What is going on in here?
!
You're talking to a boy.
April?
April?
April?
Are you hurt?
Don't think so.
What the hell did you do?
- Corakinus.
- They found us.
Something is not right.
GASPING
Now, that's interesting.
What's interesting?
What is that thing?
It's a displacement gun.
One of the few things in time and space able to kill a Shadow Kin.
It hits both target and shooter, tearing the body apart, scattering to the far corners of the universe, taking the Shadow Kin with it.
But Prince Valiant here had to get all heroic and you must've got a glancing blow.
I'm guessing that's a Shadow Kin.
More than that.
He's the king of the Shadow Kin.
That's not an encouraging look.
It sent his heart out into space, which should have killed him but...
You both now share April's heart.
God knows, it big enough.
What's she talking about?
I think your heart is phasing in and out of space-time, because he wants you.
He wants your...
SINISTER CHUCKLE
You cannot kill me without killing the girl, too.
Not a problem.
Kill him, your Highness.
You...
What?
I will not.
What?
You would hesitate from killing the leader of the Shadow Kin?
!
I would hesitate from killing a friend.
This is not over.
It isn't.
We've got a problem.
PHONE ALERT
- Are you OK?
- I'm not supposed to talk to you.
- You just got attacked by a shadow.
- Yeah, I know.
We have an enemy to fight.
Who's not here at the moment.
Look, we were told to keep our heads down and not cause any excitement.
- Wait a minute.
- What was that thing?
Shadow Kin, you ludicrous Care Bear.
Is this how little attention you pay in class, too?
All right, all right.
Look...
Would you believe me if I... if I said I was from another... planet?
God, yeah.
You're weird and don't know anything about pop culture.
You either alien or Amish.
I'm totally not prejudiced.
I come from a planet more beautiful than you could ever believe.
We.
We come from that planet.
It was paradise.
So, not Sheffield, then.
My people were the Rhodia.
We were a cultured, learned society.
- Can you picture it?
- Sort of.
I think I banged my head when I fell.
Well, go on.
Tell her.
He was their prince.
You were a prince?
No wonder you're strange.
I am a prince, just... without a people.
We were at war when it happened.
War against the Quill.
Our teacher here was the Quill's leading terrorist.
Freedom fighter.
The Quill lived on the smaller of the southern continents.
They mismanaged their economy and grew resentful of our success.
The Rhodia ate up all the planets resources, including those of the Quill, and then they were surprised when we objected.
We tried to help you!
By making us so dependent that we could never recover.
Hang on a minute.
Do you always look like this or were you totally all alien and had to modify your appearance to look human?
No.
Why do you ask?
It doesn't matter.
We won.
And the Rhodia have a particularly cruel punishment.
It is just.
They release a creature into your skull called an ahn.
Something about the size of two of your weirdly large human thumbs placed together.
Now imagine it with teeth and claws, digging into your brain, each claw tipped with poison.
Oh, and that's the nice bit.
It telepathically links you to a particular Rhodia, and you become their slave.
- Their servant.
- It is slavery.
It is punishment.
You can't...
If I use a weapon other than my own hands, the ahn kills me.
Yet, if I fail to protect you, I am also killed.
If I tried to remove the ahn, dead again.
- Slavery.
- Our tormentors become our protectors.
The leader of the Quill bound the future leader of the Rhodia.
What more civilised punishment could there be?
What does this have to do with the shadow people?
We were so busy fighting amongst ourselves, we never saw them coming.
They can exist as pure shadow... living unnoticed and untouchable in yours.
In this form, they can only be killed if you are.
Which is why the gun is set to shoot both ways.
They'll invade an entire world before anyone even knows they're there.
They only need to be in their solid form for the briefest of moments.
Because why would you fear your own shadow?
They killed everyone.
Everyone.
Rhodia and Quill alike.
A planet of three billion, all gone in... one day.
They killed my mother.
You two survived.
I saved you.
Run!
Agh!
Come on!
And I saved you.
How did you escape?
We were rescued.
By a figure of legend out of space and time itself.
Whatever.
Arrangements were made.
We were told to try and fit in and tell people we were from Sheffield.
I don't understand how they found us.
That opening Corakinus crawled back into.
Are they coming to kill our planet?
I mean, my planet, I guess.
This isn't how they invade.
This is different.
They're clearly looking for us.
Unfinished business.
- We should leave.
- No.
They'll follow us wherever we go.
I won't spend the rest of my life on the run.
Oh, and yet you hesitate to take your revenge.
Revenge?
APRIL GASPS
April.
April.
What's happening to her?
Why are you standing there?
!
- Do something!
- I see them.
I can hear his thoughts.
He wants you.
He wants something you have.
The gun?
He's coming for tomorrow night.
I'm going to have to cancel prom.
No, no.
If they want to kill everyone, they'll just slide into our shadows and do it at home.
Great.
Die alone or die at a party.
Plus, if we're all here, it's the best chance we'll have of getting your heart back.
You said that you could hear his thoughts.
It's gone now, but for a minute...
For a minute.
Well, for a minute he could probably read yours.
They've obviously connected because of the heart.
I told you we should kill her.
No-one is killing her.
DOOR OPENS
Leave us!
We are decorating.
DOOR CLOSES
If you see anything more, you tell us immediately.
OK?
Oh, thank God you said that.
I'd have just kept it to myself.
Just be careful of your shadows at the prom tonight, OK?
What have you seen?
Could you believe all that stuff?
Aliens, and Charlie being a prince?
I don't know.
I was attacked by a shadow.
Kind of opens your mind a little bit.
You take care.
You hear?
Thanks.
Ahem... you, too.
Why don't you tell your mum the prom's being assigned as a sociology module?
You look gorgeous!
I don't, but thanks.
- April!
- People just think that nice means fragile.
That somehow if I'm allowed to see what the real world's like, then I'll break, but...
I'm tougher than they think.
I know how tough you are.
And you're not nice.
You're kind.
There's a difference.
But kind is better.
Way better.
Yeah, cos that's what people think when they want a prom date.
"Oh, I wonder who's kind?"
April, just because you have to do a lot for me...
I don't mind.
Doesn't mean I stop being your mum.
You do look gorgeous.
And that's that.
SPEAKS OWN LANGUAGE
SHOUTING CONTINUES FROM INSIDE
Hello.
Everything all right?
Oh, yeah.
My deeply religious parents are very happy I'm going to dance with a boy.
This has been in evening of love and warmth.
Great.
You are a very strange person.
She's got a driver?
Uber, Dad.
Practice in the morning.
Oh, my God!
If you tell me one more time, I might literally go insane.
Don't abuse the word literally.
It's a good word that young people squander.
What's that, Dad?
Have a good time tonight?
Well, thanks, I'm sure I will.
You're facing a very important step in your future soon.
You have no idea what I'm facing, Dad.
What?
- What are you facing?
- See you later, Dad.
- DOOR SHUTS
- Have fun.
You look amazing.
You, too.
DANCE MUSIC
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Get some space between you.
Honestly!
Is that all you people think about?
Look at all of these people!
Oh, this is going to look so good for my university application.
Do you not have a date?
Is OK.
You can dance with us.
How are you feeling?
How's your... heart?
Weird, but OK.
I keep getting really short of breath, but I'm adjusting to it.
It's amazing what the body can get used to.
I do not understand these signs.
Come on, let's dance.
For tonight, we might die.
Are you all right?
OK, seriously, what is wrong with you?
Hey, Ram!
Looking good, man.
Nothing, just nerves.

Yes, there was a huge attack I'm keeping secret from you.
I should've put a creature in your head to make you nicer.
- Yeah, should've, but didn't.
- Hmm.
If there is any trouble, the gun is set for you.
Something is happening to your friend.
Help, April!
April!
Is she epileptic?
Do we need to call an ambulance?
What do you see?

- They're opening... the tear.
Is that a bad thing?

You don't have to prove anything to me, Ram.

- We have to close that rift.
- Oh, is that where we're going wrong?
The Prince of Rhodia and his little pet.
Kill him.
Kill him!
HEARTBEATS THUD
- Ha-ha, you know why I'm here, Prince.
- You can't have it.
Then we'll just have to cover this planet in shadow, too.
No, you won't.
You won't kill me because you'll die yourself.
There is enough time of possibilities other than death.
Argh!
April!
No!
They've locked us in.
We're trapped!
Stop it.
You've got what you wanted.
Just go!
I've not yet got what I wanted.
HE GROWLS
Well, nothing left to do, then, is there, but to die well.
HE GROWLS
You know, I never thought that was possible.
Dying well.
Who wants to die well?
Surely, the aim should be NOT dying well?
You.
- You.
- Who?
- Who?
- Who?
Oh, this is a bit of a mess, isn't it?
I used to be the caretaker here, you know?
Before it got all fancy.
This is going to be quite a clean-up job.
You've heard of me, haven't you?
You are the great destruction of the universe.
Yes, but most people just call me the Doctor.
There was something I wanted to ask you...
Oh, yes!
What exactly do you think you're doing here?
We might ask you the same question.
Fair enough.
It's just that I seem to have a soft spot for people who are the last of their species, which you have made my friends here.
I found them a home, but they were supposed to live quietly.
Plus... they called.
We've got a problem.
This is not your normal modus operandi.
You invade in secret.
And you kill all at once.
You don't just pour in like any old boring army!
Bit inelegant for the Shadow Kin, isn't it?
We are here... for the Cabinet.
Oh, the Cabinet!
Oh, that's easy.
There's this painfully strange shop here called Ikea...
The Cabinet of Souls.
What's the Cabinet of Souls?
It's the centre of Rhodian religion.
The soul of every Rhodian who dies is supposed to go there.
It's a repository for a future paradise.
And a weapon.
Yes.
That, too.
It's the power of all that life crammed down into single specks of light.
It could be enough to destroy an entire species.
- He can use it against us.
- Yes.
- Yes, and who would blame him?
- I would.
Why avenge genocide with genocide?
Why avenge?
Trust me...
It doesn't matter.
The Cabinet is empty.
I knew it would be.
Every Rhodian does.
It's just bedtime stories for children to make death less scary.
As if death should be anything but terrifying.
Then why would you take it?
I kept it in memory of my people.
All my people who are gone!
Yes.
That is a crime that has not yet been answered for.
And who will make me?
You are powerful... but we are a legion.
SHE GRUNTS
You leave... or I'll make you leave.
What's going on here?
SCREWDRIVER TRILLS
You have been very busy here, haven't you?
- One heart.
Two people.
- It's why you can't kill me.
But I can.
You leave...
- or you die.
- CHARLIE:
April, no.
If you came for me, take me.
Leave these people alone.
Weren't any of you listening when I talked about not dying well?
- No-one else is dying here today.
- We disagree.
Tell me, Corakinus...
Yes, I know who you are.
You have one weakness.
It's why you skulk.
Even in your most solid form, you cannot exist when there are no...
TANYA:

- You thought correctly.
You just need a boost to the voltage!
SCREWDRIVER TRILLS

You have not seen the last of us.
Yeah, I get that a lot.
No, he still has April's heart!
Oh, for God's sake!
I don't care how you do it, but save her heart.
Sacrifice yourself if you must!
- I have no choice but to obey, Master.
- Don't call me that!
SHE YELLS
I shall take my heart with me.
Do something with your laser pointer!
It's a screwdriver.
- WHIRRING
- What will you do, Doctor?
Kill us both or let us both live?
Those are your choices.
April!

Will he live?
Yes, yes, he will.
But the more interesting question is, what are we going to do with you lot?
That opening the Shadow Kin came through,
- you couldn't close it all the way.
- Well, obviously, there's been so much artron energy around good old Coal Hill that time itself has worn thin.
I bet they didn't take that into account when they renovated.
And it can only be patched up so well.
Even by me.
So, those things will come back?
Well, they'll have to find you first.
I scrambled the pulsation.
Of course, Cole Hill will continue to act like a beacon across all of space-time, to any being who might want to make mischief with it.
So, you will have to be on your guard.
What?
No, no, no.
I thought you were going to get us out of here?
Why would you be safer somewhere else?
Time has looked at your faces.
And time... time... never forgets.
OK, Doctor.
Hey, hey, listen.
Um...
All right, these people...
Yes, they may disgust me, but at the end of the day, they're just children.
- They can't cope with this.
- I think that they have shown some rather extraordinary spirit, don't you?
A willingness to sacrifice themselves to save others.
Resourcefulness.
- Bravery.
- DOOR OPENS
And, oh, yes...
An absolute understanding of how precious life is.
- You got your leg back?
- I had some spares in the medical bay.
The Lothan, giant centipedes, experts in prosthetic legs.
You'll get the hang of it.
You just have to train it to act like your own leg.

You can't seriously expect these juveniles to deal with whatever is going to come through these tears in space and time?
- Through the what?
- It's like the Hellmouth.
- Or that town in Once Upon A Time.
- Or The Vampire Diaries.
- You watch Vampire Diaries?
- Everyone is very attractive.
Yes, it's true.
SHE GROANS
Well, they won't be on their own.
Oh, no...
No, no, please...
It is bad enough that I am a slave to that... prince.
You have committed a crime and you will be punished.
No, I was a freedom fighter for my people.
We were oppressed by...
You know what I'm talking about.
- Oh...
- Hm...
I can't be everywhere.
So!
You will help these amazing humans here... and these amazing humans will help you.
How?
I can't fire weapons!
I can't use swords and knives and screwdrivers!
Your brain, Miss Quill.
Best weapon there is.
Look at you!
What an amazing team!
You'll be able to handle anything that time throws at you.
Oh, come on!
Cheer up!
It's not that hard.
It's no harder than all these exams that you have to take these days.
Except for Media Studies.
It's going to be harder than that.

I don't want to be alone, either.
How...?
How are you not deranged with grief for your people as I am for mine?
How does the rage not consume your life at every waking moment?
How do you know it doesn't?
A prince can't simply run around being furious.
A prince is... responsible for his people.
What do you mean?
You...
The Cabinet of Souls IS empty?
I wish it wasn't as much as you.

We need volunteers.
- My mum says I'm too young.
- But its for year 12.
Technically you qualify, despite, you know, being, like, two years ahead.
How old are you, anyway?
Oh, because that question never gets old!
I think I'm going to ask Charlie to the prom.
And you just made us fail the Bechdel test.
- The what?
- You're funny!
Besides, I don't think the new kid is into...
- Wait, prom is tomorrow.
- Mm-hm.
You don't have a date yet?
So that's a yes to helping me decorate.
How would one dress?
Well, the boys wear dinner jackets and the girls wear ballgowns, but you don't need to be that gender specific.
I don't know what you did in your last job, but...
I am not a baby-sitter.
Except... you kind of... are.
Anyway... about the p... prom.
Um...
I was thinking that maybe you and I could...
You know.
Oh!
Er...
No.
I shouldn't think so.
Ha!
That was painful.
Look at you all.
The cream of the crop.
High achievers.
No wonder this country only exports Downton Abbey.
- I like Downton Abbey.
- Of course YOU like it.
It's a bunch of white people being nice to each other.
You'd watch it if Idris Elba were in it.
Are we cheating already, Charles?
You haven't actually taught us anything yet.
True.
So how about our first lesson of the day?
- SCREEN SMASHES
- Your teacher has awful butterfingers.
You can't do that!
That's his private property.
April Maclean, the answer to the question are spinsters born or made?
You got a date for the prom yet?
Pretty sure you're not allowed to ask that.
- I've got a date.
- Of course, Ram.
The boy who hears silent applause every time he walks into a room.
Solve it.
- Don't look so pained, Matteusz.
- Is this even in the book?
I honestly think she makes this stuff up.
It's the Gibbs probability density in a classical Klein-Gordon field.
Well, it is.
We're not supposed to understand it.
She just wants us to feel stupid.
I bet she ate that missing kid.
He was eaten?
Where are you from anyway?
You sound like the Queen.
I'm from Sheffield.

I shall ask Matteusz as my date.
Oh...
Oh!

No, no, no...
The schools in Sheffield are very different.
No, it's great.
It's... it's fantastic.

Why would you help decorate something that you can't even go to?
Because that sad individual is probably the only chance you have at a friend.
Yeah, I'm under far too much pressure.
Tell me about it.
- Just a minute.
- All right.
I'll have some of this.
It's two-for-one...
Still weird to see without your uniform, Tanya.
- I'm in sixth form now.
- Overachiever.
I caught my husband fiddling with himself on the stairs.
Thank you.
I'm home.
- SHE SNIFFS
- You took your own sweet time.
- DOOR OPENS
- Hello?
You're usually done by now.
Hello to you too.
Mum, you know this prom at school...
You're too young to be dancing with boys.
But I'm technically...
Your brain is smart enough to have allowed you to skip ahead, but you are still a little girl.
One who isn't even finished with her homework.
- Work fast.
Fun is for later.
- When, when I'm 40?
What's the matter?
Why are you upset?
Perhaps a better question is why aren't you?
All the time, at every moment.
Did you kill that student?
I saw burn marks that look like they were from your gun.
'Take it!
'
Now, you know as well as I do I'm not allowed to use my gun.
You'd find a way, some loophole.
Did you kill that student?
Yes.
Yes!
I tricked that student into using my gun to kill himself.
I also may not lie to you, remember?
And as long as I am forced to perform this slavery...
Punishment.
"To-may-to, to-ma-to".
I will keep you safe, but you will NOT...
question me!
Where are you going?
What did I just say?
You have to shoot it!
I can't use the gun!
Shoot it!
Shoot it now!
This just means that I can do it the way that I want it.
Whatever you say.
Look, I'm going to meet a friend for a...
- PHONE BEEPS - "granola and kale falafel".
God, how Shoreditch has changed.
Can I trust you with this?
Of course I can trust you with this.
I've just sat down.
I'm going out with Rachel later.
I need the answers now.
Have you paid into my gaming account?
Yes, you ridiculous nerd.
OK.
The first steps you take in breaking down the formula...
A... night... full... of promise.
I wonder if that's what prom means...
Weird.
- Like this?
- Yeah, exactly.
Isn't this great?
The two of us... talking about something other than what the white people are doing.
You tell anyone about this, you're dead.
I mean dead.
What was that?
No, is it promenade?
Hm...
Help!
There's nothing.
What did you see?
Was it a shadow?
What do you know about shadows?
- Tanya!
- Ram!
Help!
Anyone?
!
We're in terrible danger.
No, I'm telling you, I'm seeing it right now.
There's someone attacking her!
- SHE GROANS
- Wait...
What?
Tanya, what's your address?
I don't know!
Something with a 3 in it.
I think you know what waits for you here.
You think the same plan will work!
But I am what waits for you.
And I am war itself!
Run.
- Where is the prince?
- Prince?
The singer?
Oh, shit!
Shit!
I can't use the gun, but you can do it - please!
More lights, Tanya.
Get rid of all the shadows.
Well, obviously!
No!
- No, please!
No!
- No!
It's part of your shadow!
Just shoot it!
Shoot it now, or it'll kill us both!
April, no!
Did you kill it?
I don't...
What is going on in here?
!
You're talking to a boy.
April?
April?
April?
Are you hurt?
Don't think so.
What the hell did you do?
- Corakinus.
- They found us.
Something is not right.
Now, that's interesting.
What's interesting?
What is that thing?
It's a displacement gun.
One of the few things in time and space able to kill a Shadow Kin.
It hits both target and shooter, tearing the body apart, scattering to the far corners of the universe, taking the Shadow Kin with it.
But Prince Valiant here had to get all heroic and you must've got a glancing blow.
I'm guessing that's a Shadow Kin.
More than that.
He's the king of the Shadow Kin.
That's not an encouraging look.
It sent his heart out into space, which should have killed him but...
You both now share April's heart.
God knows, it big enough.
What's she talking about?
I think your heart is phasing in and out of space-time, because he wants you.
He wants your...
You cannot kill me without killing the girl, too.
Not a problem.
Kill him, your Highness.
You...
What?
I will not.
What?
You would hesitate from killing the leader of the Shadow Kin?
!
I would hesitate from killing a friend.
This is not over.
It isn't.
We've got a problem
Are you OK?
I'm not supposed to talk to you.
- You just got attacked by a shadow.
- Yeah, I know.
We have an enemy to fight.
Who's not here at the moment.
Look, we were told to keep our heads down and not cause any excitement.
- Wait a minute.
- What was that thing?
Shadow Kin, you ludicrous Care Bear.
Is this how little attention you pay in class, too?
All right, all right.
Look...
Would you believe me if I... if I said I was from another... planet?
God, yeah.
You're weird and don't know anything about pop culture.
You either alien or Amish.
I'm totally not prejudiced.
I come from a planet more beautiful than you could ever believe.
We.
We come from that planet.
It was paradise.
So, not Sheffield, then.
My people were the Rhodia.
We were a cultured, learned society.
- Can you picture it?
- Sort of.
I think I banged my head when I fell.
Well, go on.
Tell her.
He was their prince.
You were a prince?
No wonder you're strange.
I am a prince, just... without a people.
We were at war when it happened.
War against the Quill.
Our teacher here was the Quill's leading terrorist.
Freedom fighter.
The Quill lived on the smaller of the southern continents.
They mismanaged their economy and grew resentful of our success.
The Rhodia ate up all the planets resources, including those of the Quill, and then they were surprised when we objected.
We tried to help you!
By making us so dependent that we could never recover.
Hang on a minute.
Do you always look like this or were you totally all alien and had to modify your appearance to look human?
No.
Why do you ask?
It doesn't matter.
We won.
And the Rhodia have a particularly cruel punishment.
It is just.
They release a creature into your skull called an ahn.
Something about the size of two of your weirdly large human thumbs placed together.
Now imagine it with teeth and claws, digging into your brain, each claw tipped with poison.
Oh, and that's the nice bit.
It telepathically links you to a particular Rhodia - and you become their slave.
- Their servant.
- It is slavery.
It is punishment.
You can't...
If I use a weapon other than my own hands, the ahn kills me.
Yet, if I fail to protect you, I am also killed.
If I tried to remove the ahn, dead again.
- Slavery.
- Our tormentors become our protectors.
The leader of the Quill bound the future leader of the Rhodia.
What more civilised punishment could there be?
What does this have to do with the shadow people?
We were so busy fighting amongst ourselves, we never saw them coming.
They can exist as pure shadow... living unnoticed and untouchable in yours.
In this form, they can only be killed if you are.
Which is why the gun is set to shoot both ways.
They'll invade an entire world before anyone even knows they're there.
They only need to be in their solid form for the briefest of moments.
Because why would you fear your own shadow?
They killed everyone.
Everyone.
Rhodia and Quill alike.
A planet of three billion, all gone in... one day.
They killed my mother.
You two survived.
I saved you.
Run!
Agh!
Come on!
And I saved you.
How did you escape?
We were rescued.
By a figure of legend out of space and time itself.
Whatever.
Arrangements were made.
We were told to try and fit in and tell people we were from Sheffield.
I don't understand how they found us.
That opening Corakinus crawled back into.
Are they coming to kill our planet?
I mean, my planet, I guess.
This isn't how they invade.
This is different.
They're clearly looking for us.
Unfinished business.
- We should leave.
- No.
They'll follow us wherever we go.
I won't spend the rest of my life on the run.
Oh, and yet you hesitate to take your revenge.
Revenge?
April.
April.
What's happening to her?
Why are you standing there?
!
- Do something!
- I see them.
I can hear his thoughts.
He wants you.
He wants something you have.
The gun?
He's coming for tomorrow night.
I'm going to have to cancel prom.
No, no.
If they want to kill everyone, they'll just slide into our shadows and do it at home.
Great.
Die alone or die at a party.
Plus, if we're all here, it's the best chance we'll have of getting your heart back.
You said that you could hear his thoughts.
It's gone now, but for a minute...
For a minute.
Well, for a minute he could probably read yours.
They've obviously connected because of the heart.
I told you we should kill her.
No-one is killing her.
Leave us!
We are decorating.
If you see anything more, you tell us immediately.
OK?
Oh, thank God you said that.
I'd have just kept it to myself.
Just be careful of your shadows at the prom tonight, OK?
What have you seen?
Could you believe all that stuff?
Aliens, and Charlie being a prince?
I don't know.
I was attacked by a shadow.
Kind of opens your mind a little bit.
You take care.
You hear?
Thanks.
Ahem... you, too.
Why don't you tell your mum the prom's being assigned as a sociology module?
You look gorgeous!
I don't, but thanks.
April!
People just think that nice means fragile.
That somehow if I'm allowed to see what the real world's like, then I'll break, but...
I'm tougher than they think.
I know how tough you are.
And you're not nice.
You're kind.
There's a difference.
But kind is better.
Way better.
Yeah, cos that's what people think when they want a prom date.
"Oh, I wonder who's kind?"
April, just because you have to do a lot for me...
I don't mind.
Doesn't mean I stop being your mum.
You do look gorgeous.
And that's that.
Hello.
Everything all right?
Oh, yeah.
My deeply religious parents are very happy I'm going to dance with a boy.
This has been in evening of love and warmth.
Great.
You are a very strange person.
She's got a driver?
Uber, Dad.
Practice in the morning.
Oh, my God!
If you tell me one more time, I might literally go insane.
Don't abuse the word literally.
It's a good word that young people squander.
What's that, Dad?
Have a good time tonight?
Well, thanks, I'm sure I will.
You're facing a very important step in your future soon.
You have no idea what I'm facing, Dad.
What?
What are you facing?
See you later, Dad.
- DOOR SHUTS
- Have fun.
You look amazing.
You, too.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Get some space between you.
Honestly!
Is that all you people think about?
Look at all of these people!
Oh, this is going to look so good for my university application.
Do you not have a date?
Is OK.
You can dance with us.
How are you feeling?
How's your... heart?
Weird, but OK.
I keep getting really short of breath, but I'm adjusting to it.
It's amazing what the body can get used to.
I do not understand these signs.
Come on, let's dance.
For tonight, we might die.
Are you all right?
OK, seriously, what is wrong with you?
Hey, Ram!
Looking good, man.
Nothing, just nerves.
The great Ram Singh, nervous?
Tanya!
I thought your mum wouldn't let you come.
Yeah, I told her missing this would stunt my interpersonal development.
I have to write an essay about it, though.
Although, actually, it might be quite interesting.
Wow.
That's how you do a prom.
I'm dressed really nice...
All right?
And we're changing the tune, now.
We've got some nice ones coming your way...
- That was such a good one!
- You look so good.
- I'm going to go to the toilet.
- I'll come with you.
OK.
Anything?
Yes, there was a huge attack I'm keeping secret from you.
I should've put a creature in your head to make you nicer.
- Yeah, should've, but didn't.
- Hmm.
If there is any trouble, the gun is set for you.
Something is happening to your friend.
Help,April!
April!
Is she uploading?
Do we need to call an ambulance?
What do you see?
- SHE GASPS
- They're opening...
the tear.
Is that a bad thing?
You don't have to prove anything to me, Ram.
What?
I know that you've got the whole sporting ego thing going on, but I like you because I know that, deep down, that's not true.
Now, will you please let me go to the...
Where is... the prince?
!
The prince?
!
- No!
- What?
Oh, no.
You killed her!
Where is the prince?
Did you hire a band?
We need to get everybody out.
Where are all the teachers?
!
Move along, please.
Boyfriend dumped her on prom night.
I must be allergic to the punch!
- You're all in danger.
- You have to go!
Please, you've got to get out!
Stop ignoring me!
There's a fire and you've got to get out of the building or you're going to die.
Get out!
Oh!
For God's sake!
I will ask you one last time.
Where is the prince?
I am the prince!
- CRASHING, FEEDBACK SQUEAKS
- Whoa!
Will none of you people listen to niceness ever?
!
Turn the music back on!
You'd listen to me if I was some A-hole telling you how fat you looked on Instagram!
- ALL CHATTER
- Do they do this at American proms?
All right.
Yeah, back up.
Listen!
- You're all in grave danger.
- From what?
From the smoke.
You killed her!
- April, come here.
- Come on, let's go.
- We have to close that rift.
- Oh, is that where we're going wrong?
The Prince of Rhodia and his little pet.
Kill him.
Kill him!
- Ha-ha, you know why I'm here, Prince.
- You can't have it.
Then we'll just have to cover this planet in shadow, too.
No, you won't.
You won't kill me because you'll die yourself.
There is enough time of possibilities other than death.
Argh!
April!
No!
They've locked us in.
We're trapped!
Stop it.
You've got what you wanted.
Just go!
I've not yet got what I wanted.
Well, nothing left to do, then, is there, but to die well.
You know, I never thought that was possible.
Dying well.
Who wants to die well?
Surely, the aim should be NOT dying well?
You.
- You.
- Who?
- Who?
- Who?
Oh, this is a bit of a mess, isn't it?
I used to be the caretaker here, you know?
Before it got all fancy.
This is going to be quite a clean-up job.
You've heard of me, haven't you?
You are the great destruction of the universe.
Yes, but most people just call me the Doctor.
There was something I wanted to ask you...
Oh, yes!
What exactly do you think you're doing here?
We might ask you the same question.
Fair enough.
It's just that I seem to have a soft spot for people who are the last of their species - which you have made my friends here.
I found them a home, but they were supposed to live quietly.
Plus... they called.
We've got a problem.
This is not your normal modus operandi.
You invade in secret.
And you kill all at once.
You don't just pour in like any old boring army!
Bit inelegant for the Shadow Kin, isn't it?
We are here... for the Cabinet.
Oh, the Cabinet!
Oh, that's easy.
There's this painfully strange shop here called Ikea...
The Cabinet of Souls.
What's the Cabinet of Souls?
It's the centre of Rhodian religion.
The soul of every Rhodian who dies is supposed to go there.
It's a repository for a future paradise.
And a weapon.
Yes.
That, too.
It's the power of all that life crammed down into single specks of light.
It could be enough to destroy an entire species.
- He can use it against us.
- Yes.
- Yes, and who would blame him?
- I would.
Why avenge genocide with genocide?
Why avenge?
Trust me...
It doesn't matter.
The Cabinet is empty.
I knew it would be.
Every Rhodian does.
It's just bedtime stories for children to make death less scary.
As if death should be anything but terrifying.
Then why would you take it?
I kept it in memory of my people.
All my people who are gone!
Yes.
That is a crime that has not yet been answered for.
And who will make me?
You are powerful... but we are a legion.
You leave... or I'll make you leave.
What's going on here?
You have been very busy here, haven't you?
- One heart.
Two people.
- It's why you can't kill me.
But I can.
You leave...
- or you die.
- April, no.
If you came for me, take me.
Leave these people alone.
Weren't any of you listening when I talked about not dying well?
- No-one else is dying here today.
- We disagree.
Tell me, Corakinus...
Yes, I know who you are.
You have one weakness.
It's why you skulk.
Even in your most solid form, you cannot exist when there are no...
Shadows!
- I thought that would work...
- You thought correctly.
You just need a boost to the voltage!
You have not seen the last of us.
Yeah, I get that a lot.
No, he still has April's heart!
Oh, for God's sake!
I don't care how you do it, but save her heart.
Sacrifice yourself if you must!
- I have no choice but to obey, Master.
- Don't call me that!
I shall take my heart with me.
Do something with your laser pointer!
It's a screwdriver.
WHIRRING What will you do, Doctor?
Kill us both or let us both live?
Those are your choices.
April!
Duck.
Who says you're the only one who gets to make the decisions?
I will find you!
- That was very brave.
- He killed her.
He did even think about it.
He just...
Will he live?
Yes, yes, he will.
But the more interesting question is, what are we going to do with you lot?
That opening the Shadow Kin came through, you couldn't close it all the way.
Well, obviously, there's been so much artron energy around good old Coal Hill that time itself has worn thin.
I bet they didn't take that into account when they renovated.
And it can only be patched up so well.
Even by me.
So, those things will come back?
Well, they'll have to find you first.
I scrambled the pulsation.
Of course, Cole Hill will continue to act like a beacon across all of space-time, to any being who might want to make mischief with it.
So, you will have to be on your guard.
What?
No, no, no.
I thought you were going to get us out of here?
Why would you be safer somewhere else?
Time has looked at your faces.
And time... time... never forgets.
OK, Doctor.
Hey, hey, listen.
Um...
All right, these people...
Yes, they may disgust me, but at the end of the day, they're just children.
- They can't cope with this.
- I think that they have shown some rather extraordinary spirit, don't you?
A willingness to sacrifice themselves to save others.
Resourcefulness.
Bravery.
DOOR OPENS
And, oh, yes...
An absolute understanding of how precious life is.
You got your leg back?
I had some spares in the medical bay.
The Lothan - giant centipedes - experts in prosthetic legs.
You'll get the hang of it.
You just have to train it to act like your own leg.
What about football?
Unbelievably boring sport.
Now, darts...
Darts is something worth practising for.
Maths and alcoholic beverages.
The best way to spend a morning.
No, wait.
Wait...
You can't seriously expect these juveniles to deal with whatever is going to come through these tears in space and time?
- Through the what?
- It's like the Hellmouth.
- Or that town in Once Upon A Time.
- Or The Vampire Diaries.
- You watch Vampire Diaries?
- Everyone is very attractive.
Yes, it's true.
Well, they won't be on their own.
Oh, no...
No, no, please...
It is bad enough that I am a slave to that... prince.
You have committed a crime and you will be punished.
No, I was a freedom fighter for my people.
We were oppressed by...
You know what I'm talking about.
- Oh...
- Hm...
I can't be everywhere.
So!
You will help these amazing humans here... and these amazing humans will help you.
How?
I can't fire weapons!
I can't use swords and knives and screwdrivers!
Your brain, Miss Quill.
Best weapon there is.
Look at you!
What an amazing team!
You'll be able to handle anything that time throws at you.
Oh, come on!
Cheer up!
It's not that hard.
It's no harder than all these exams that you have to take these days.
Except for Media Studies.
It's going to be harder than that.
So, are we all, like, mates, then?
I'm sorry.
About your heart.
We'll get it back - promise.
It feels so strange.
But maybe I'll be able to see if those things come back.
You're remarkably calm about this.
We'll be living on a knife edge.
All life is on a knife edge.
My mum, she was paralysed in a car accident and she should've died, but she didn't.
She adjusted and I will, too.
I'll see you Monday.
She's probably not going to let us out of our homework.
So...
How was it?
Tell me everything.
I'd, um... have to say it was... uneventful.
Hey.
Hey.
You OK?
I don't think I'll ever be OK.
I'm so sorry about Rachel.
Look, I'm sorry...
I don't mean to...
Don't worry.
I don't want to be alone, either.
How...?
How are you not deranged with grief for your people as I am for mine?
How does the rage not consume your life at every waking moment?
How do you know it doesn't?
A prince can't simply run around being furious.
A prince is... responsible for his people.
What do you mean?
You...
The Cabinet of Souls IS empty?
I wish it wasn't as much as you.
Shame.
We could have killed them.
We could have killed them all.
Committing one genocide for another.
Were you ever going to let that stop you?
- SHE SCOFFS
- It wouldn't stop me.
Do you know the feeling of dread?
- Has something happened?
- I saw something.
It was horrible.
Like, really horrible.
Who are you?
What are you doing here?
The Doctor said you're supposed to help us.
You're my protector.
Too easy, posh-o.
It's like pushing over a lamb.
Kevin never got home last night.
Everyone knows students at this school disappear - they all just pretend it isn't happening.
Tanya?
Are you coming to help decorate later?
We need volunteers.
- My mum says I'm too young.
- But its for year 12.
Technically you qualify, despite, you know, being, like, two years ahead.
How old are you, anyway?
Because that question never gets old!
I think I'm going to ask Charlie to the prom.
And you just made us fail the Bechdel test.
- The what?
- You're funny!
Besides, I don't think the new kid is into...
Wait, prom is tomorrow.
You don't have a date yet?
So that's a yes to helping me decorate.
How would one dress?
Well, the boys wear dinner jackets and the girls wear ballgowns, but you don't need to be that gender specific.
I don't know what you did in your last job, but...
I am not a baby-sitter.
Except... you kind of... are.
Anyway... about the p... prom.
Um...
I was thinking that maybe you and I could...
You know.
Er...
No.
I shouldn't think so.
Ha!
That was painful.
Look at you all.
The cream of the crop.
High achievers.
No wonder this country only exports Downton Abbey.
- I like Downton Abbey.
- Of course YOU like it.
It's a bunch of white people being nice to each other.
You'd watch it if Idris Elba were in it.
Are we cheating already, Charles?
You haven't actually taught us anything yet.
True.
So how about our first lesson of the day?
- SCREEN SMASHES
- Your teacher has awful butterfingers.
You can't do that!
That's his private property.
April Maclean, the answer to the question are spinsters born or made?
You got a date for the prom yet?
Pretty sure you're not allowed to ask that.
- I've got a date.
- Of course, Ram.
The boy who hears silent applause every time he walks into a room.
Solve it.
- Don't look so pained, Matteusz.
- Is this even in the book?
I honestly think she makes this stuff up.
It's the Gibbs probability density in a classical Klein-Gordon field.
Well, it is.
We're not supposed to understand it.
She just wants us to feel stupid.
I bet she ate that missing kid.
He was eaten?
Where are you from anyway?
You sound like the Queen.
I'm from Sheffield.
Why am I even talking to you geeks?
Don't make me put you in detention, Ram.
You wouldn't like it.
The big decoration tonight.
All volunteers are welcome.
Big decorations night.
Autumn Ball.
All volunteers are welcome.
All volunteers are welcome.
Big decoration tonight.
Here you are.
Need you.
Come and help me.
Anyone?
Heya.
Having a date to the prom is important, yes?
Um...
Yeah.
I shall ask Matteusz as my date.
Is this not right?
No, no, no...
The schools in Sheffield are very different.
No, it's great.
It's... it's fantastic.
And it totally makes sense.
Good for you.
- Thank you.
- OK.
Of course he is.
Of course.
- On the left!
- Through!
- Open!
Move!
- Open!
I've got it!
- Yes!
- Come on!
Ram!
Come on!
Get the ball!
Quick, quick!
Open!
What the hell was that?
!
- Coach...
- 20 laps.
Now.
- What for?
- 25.
Get a move on.
No.
No.
Why would you help decorate something that you can't even go to?
Because that sad individual is probably the only chance you have at a friend.
Yeah, I'm under far too much pressure.
Tell me about it.
- Just a minute.
- All right.
I'll have some of this.
It's two-for-one...
Still weird to see without your uniform, Tanya.
- I'm in sixth form now.
- Overachiever.
I caught my husband fiddling with himself on the stairs.
Thank you.
I'm home.
You took your own sweet time.
Hello?
You're usually done by now.
Hello to you too.
Mum, you know this prom at school...
You're too young to be dancing with boys.
But I'm technically...
Your brain is smart enough to have allowed you to skip ahead, but you are still a little girl.
One who isn't even finished with her homework.
- Work fast.
Fun is for later.
- When, when I'm 40?
What's the matter?
Why are you upset?
Perhaps a better question is why aren't you?
All the time, at every moment.
Did you kill that student?
I saw burn marks that look like they were from your gun.
'Take it!
'
Now, you know as well as I do I'm not allowed to use my gun.
You'd find a way, some loophole.
Did you kill that student?
Yes.
Yes!
I tricked that student into using my gun to kill himself.
I also may not lie to you, remember?
And as long as I am forced to perform this slavery...
Punishment.
"To-may-to, to-ma-to".
I will keep you safe, but you will NOT...
question me!
Where are you going?
What did I just say?
You have to shoot it!
I can't use the gun!
Shoot it!
Shoot it now!
This just means that I can do it the way that I want it.
Whatever you say.
Look, I'm going to meet a friend for a...
"granola and kale falafel".
God, how Shoreditch has changed.
Can I trust you with this?
Of course I can trust you with this.
I've just sat down.
I'm going out with Rachel later.
I need the answers now.
Have you paid into my gaming account?
Yes, you ridiculous nerd.
OK.
The first steps you take in breaking down the formula...
A... night... full... of promise.
I wonder if that's what prom means...
Weird.
- Like this?
- Yeah, exactly.
Isn't this great?
The two of us... talking about something other than what the white people are doing.
You tell anyone about this, you're dead.
I mean dead.
What was that?
No, is it promenade?
Help!
There's nothing.
What did you see?
Was it a shadow?
What do you know about shadows?
- Tanya!
- Ram!
Help!
Anyone?
!
We're in terrible danger.
No, I'm telling you, I'm seeing it right now.
There's someone attacking her!
Wait...
What?
Tanya, what's your address?
I don't know!
Something with a 3 in it.
I think you know what waits for you here.
You think the same plan will work!
But I am what waits for you.
And I am war itself!
Run.
- Where is the prince?
- Prince?
The singer?
Shit!
Shit!
I can't use the gun, but you can do it - please!
More lights, Tanya.
Get rid of all the shadows.
Well, obviously!
No!
- No, please!
No!
- No!
It's part of your shadow!
Just shoot it!
Shoot it now, or it'll kill us both!
April, no!
Did you kill it?
I don't...
What is going on in here?
!
You're talking to a boy.
April?
April?
April?
Are you hurt?
Don't think so.
What the hell did you do?
- Corakinus.
- They found us.
Something is not right.
Now, that's interesting.
What's interesting?
What is that thing?
It's a displacement gun.
One of the few things in time and space able to kill a Shadow Kin.
It hits both target and shooter, tearing the body apart, scattering to the far corners of the universe, taking the Shadow Kin with it.
But Prince Valiant here had to get all heroic and you must've got a glancing blow.
I'm guessing that's a Shadow Kin.
More than that.
He's the king of the Shadow Kin.
That's not an encouraging look.
It sent his heart out into space, which should have killed him but...
You both now share April's heart.
God knows, it big enough.
What's she talking about?
I think your heart is phasing in and out of space-time, because he wants you.
He wants your...
You cannot kill me without killing the girl, too.
Not a problem.
Kill him, your Highness.
You...
What?
I will not.
What?
You would hesitate from killing the leader of the Shadow Kin?
!
I would hesitate from killing a friend.
This is not over.
It isn't.
We've got a problem
Are you OK?
I'm not supposed to talk to you.
- You just got attacked by a shadow.
- Yeah, I know.
We have an enemy to fight.
Who's not here at the moment.
Look, we were told to keep our heads down and not cause any excitement.
- Wait a minute.
- What was that thing?
Shadow Kin, you ludicrous Care Bear.
Is this how little attention you pay in class, too?
All right, all right.
Look...
Would you believe me if I... if I said I was from another... planet?
God, yeah.
You're weird and don't know anything about pop culture.
You either alien or Amish.
I'm totally not prejudiced.
I come from a planet more beautiful than you could ever believe.
We.
We come from that planet.
It was paradise.
So, not Sheffield, then.
My people were the Rhodia.
We were a cultured, learned society.
- Can you picture it?
- Sort of.
I think I banged my head when I fell.
Well, go on.
Tell her.
He was their prince.
You were a prince?
No wonder you're strange.
I am a prince, just... without a people.
We were at war when it happened.
War against the Quill.
Our teacher here was the Quill's leading terrorist.
Freedom fighter.
The Quill lived on the smaller of the southern continents.
They mismanaged their economy and grew resentful of our success.
The Rhodia ate up all the planets resources, including those of the Quill, and then they were surprised when we objected.
We tried to help you!
By making us so dependent that we could never recover.
Hang on a minute.
Do you always look like this or were you totally all alien and had to modify your appearance to look human?
No.
Why do you ask?
It doesn't matter.
We won.
And the Rhodia have a particularly cruel punishment.
It is just.
They release a creature into your skull called an ahn.
Something about the size of two of your weirdly large human thumbs placed together.
Now imagine it with teeth and claws, digging into your brain, each claw tipped with poison.
And that's the nice bit.
It telepathically links you to a particular Rhodia - and you become their slave.
- Their servant.
- It is slavery.
It is punishment.
You can't...
If I use a weapon other than my own hands, the ahn kills me.
Yet, if I fail to protect you, I am also killed.
If I tried to remove the ahn, dead again.
- Slavery.
- Our tormentors become our protectors.
The leader of the Quill bound the future leader of the Rhodia.
What more civilised punishment could there be?
What does this have to do with the shadow people?
We were so busy fighting amongst ourselves, we never saw them coming.
They can exist as pure shadow... living unnoticed and untouchable in yours.
In this form, they can only be killed if you are.
Which is why the gun is set to shoot both ways.
They'll invade an entire world before anyone even knows they're there.
They only need to be in their solid form for the briefest of moments.
Because why would you fear your own shadow?
They killed everyone.
Everyone.
Rhodia and Quill alike.
A planet of three billion, all gone in... one day.
They killed my mother.
You two survived.
I saved you.
Run!
Agh!
Come on!
And I saved you.
How did you escape?
We were rescued.
By a figure of legend out of space and time itself.
Whatever.
Arrangements were made.
We were told to try and fit in and tell people we were from Sheffield.
I don't understand how they found us.
That opening Corakinus crawled back into.
Are they coming to kill our planet?
I mean, my planet, I guess.
This isn't how they invade.
This is different.
They're clearly looking for us.
Unfinished business.
- We should leave.
- No.
They'll follow us wherever we go.
I won't spend the rest of my life on the run.
And yet you hesitate to take your revenge.
Revenge?
April.
April.
What's happening to her?
Why are you standing there?
!
- Do something!
- I see them.
I can hear his thoughts.
He wants you.
He wants something you have.
The gun?
He's coming for tomorrow night.
I'm going to have to cancel prom.
No, no.
If they want to kill everyone, they'll just slide into our shadows and do it at home.
Great.
Die alone or die at a party.
Plus, if we're all here, it's the best chance we'll have of getting your heart back.
You said that you could hear his thoughts.
It's gone now, but for a minute...
For a minute.
Well, for a minute he could probably read yours.
They've obviously connected because of the heart.
I told you we should kill her.
No-one is killing her.
Leave us!
We are decorating.
If you see anything more, you tell us immediately.
OK?
Thank God you said that.
I'd have just kept it to myself.
Just be careful of your shadows at the prom tonight, OK?
What have you seen?
Could you believe all that stuff?
Aliens, and Charlie being a prince?
I don't know.
I was attacked by a shadow.
Kind of opens your mind a little bit.
You take care.
You hear?
Thanks.
Ahem... you, too.
Why don't you tell your mum the prom's being assigned as a sociology module?
You look gorgeous!
I don't, but thanks.
April!
People just think that nice means fragile.
That somehow if I'm allowed to see what the real world's like, then I'll break, but...
I'm tougher than they think.
I know how tough you are.
And you're not nice.
You're kind.
There's a difference.
But kind is better.
Way better.
Yeah, cos that's what people think when they want a prom date.
"I wonder who's kind?"
April, just because you have to do a lot for me...
I don't mind.
Doesn't mean I stop being your mum.
You do look gorgeous.
And that's that.
Hello.
Everything all right?
Yeah.
My deeply religious parents are very happy I'm going to dance with a boy.
This has been in evening of love and warmth.
Great.
You are a very strange person.
She's got a driver?
Uber, Dad.
Practice in the morning.
My God!
If you tell me one more time, I might literally go insane.
Don't abuse the word literally.
It's a good word that young people squander.
What's that, Dad?
Have a good time tonight?
Well, thanks, I'm sure I will.
You're facing a very important step in your future soon.
You have no idea what I'm facing, Dad.
What?
What are you facing?
See you later, Dad.
Have fun.
You look amazing.
You, too.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Get some space between you.
Honestly!
Is that all you people think about?
Look at all of these people!
This is going to look so good for my university application.
Do you not have a date?
Is OK.
You can dance with us.
How are you feeling?
How's your... heart?
Weird, but OK.
I keep getting really short of breath, but I'm adjusting to it.
It's amazing what the body can get used to.
I do not understand these signs.
Come on, let's dance.
For tonight, we might die.
Are you all right?
OK, seriously, what is wrong with you?
Hey, Ram!
Looking good, man.
Nothing, just nerves.
The great Ram Singh, nervous?
Tanya!
I thought your mum wouldn't let you come.
Yeah, I told her missing this would stunt my interpersonal development.
I have to write an essay about it, though.
Although, actually, it might be quite interesting.
Wow.
That's how you do a prom.
I'm dressed really nice...
All right?
And we're changing the tune, now.
We've got some nice ones coming your way...
- That was such a good one!
- You look so good.
- I'm going to go to the toilet.
- I'll come with you.
OK.
Anything?
Yes, there was a huge attack I'm keeping secret from you.
I should've put a creature in your head to make you nicer.
Yeah, should've, but didn't.
If there is any trouble, the gun is set for you.
Something is happening to your friend.
Help,April!
April!
Is she uploading?
Do we need to call an ambulance?
What do you see?
They're opening...
the tear.
Is that a bad thing?
You don't have to prove anything to me, Ram.
What?
I know that you've got the whole sporting ego thing going on, but I like you because I know that, deep down, that's not true.
Now, will you please let me go to the...
Where is... the prince?
!
The prince?
!
- No!
- What?
No.
You killed her!
Where is the prince?
Did you hire a band?
We need to get everybody out.
Where are all the teachers?
!
Move along, please.
Boyfriend dumped her on prom night.
I must be allergic to the punch!
- You're all in danger.
- You have to go!
Please, you've got to get out!
Stop ignoring me!
There's a fire and you've got to get out of the building or you're going to die.
Get out!
For God's sake!
I will ask you one last time.
Where is the prince?
I am the prince!
Whoa!
Will none of you people listen to niceness ever?
!
Turn the music back on!
You'd listen to me if I was some A-hole telling you how fat you looked on Instagram!
Do they do this at American proms?
All right.
Yeah, back up.
Listen!
- You're all in grave danger.
- From what?
From the smoke.
You killed her!
- April, come here.
- Come on, let's go.
- We have to close that rift.
- Is that where we're going wrong?
The Prince of Rhodia and his little pet.
Kill him.
Kill him!
- Ha-ha, you know why I'm here, Prince.
- You can't have it.
Then we'll just have to cover this planet in shadow, too.
No, you won't.
You won't kill me because you'll die yourself.
There is enough time of possibilities other than death.
Argh!
April!
No!
They've locked us in.
We're trapped!
Stop it.
You've got what you wanted.
Just go!
I've not yet got what I wanted.
Well, nothing left to do, then, is there, but to die well.
You know, I never thought that was possible.
Dying well.
Who wants to die well?
Surely, the aim should be NOT dying well?
You.
- You.
- Who?
- Who?
- Who?
This is a bit of a mess, isn't it?
I used to be the caretaker here, you know?
Before it got all fancy.
This is going to be quite a clean-up job.
You've heard of me, haven't you?
You are the great destruction of the universe.
Yes, but most people just call me the Doctor.
There was something I wanted to ask you...
Yes!
What exactly do you think you're doing here?
We might ask you the same question.
Fair enough.
It's just that I seem to have a soft spot for people who are the last of their species - which you have made my friends here.
I found them a home, but they were supposed to live quietly.
Plus... they called.
We've got a problem.
This is not your normal modus operandi.
You invade in secret.
And you kill all at once.
You don't just pour in like any old boring army!
Bit inelegant for the Shadow Kin, isn't it?
We are here... for the Cabinet.
The Cabinet!
That's easy.
There's this painfully strange shop here called Ikea...
The Cabinet of Souls.
What's the Cabinet of Souls?
It's the centre of Rhodian religion.
The soul of every Rhodian who dies is supposed to go there.
It's a repository for a future paradise.
And a weapon.
Yes.
That, too.
It's the power of all that life crammed down into single specks of light.
It could be enough to destroy an entire species.
- He can use it against us.
- Yes.
- Yes, and who would blame him?
- I would.
Why avenge genocide with genocide?
Why avenge?
Trust me...
It doesn't matter.
The Cabinet is empty.
I knew it would be.
Every Rhodian does.
It's just bedtime stories for children to make death less scary.
As if death should be anything but terrifying.
Then why would you take it?
I kept it in memory of my people.
All my people who are gone!
Yes.
That is a crime that has not yet been answered for.
And who will make me?
You are powerful... but we are a legion.
You leave... or I'll make you leave.
What's going on here?
You have been very busy here, haven't you?
- One heart.
Two people.
- It's why you can't kill me.
But I can.
You leave...
- or you die.
- April, no.
If you came for me, take me.
Leave these people alone.
Weren't any of you listening when I talked about not dying well?
- No-one else is dying here today.
- We disagree.
Tell me, Corakinus...
Yes, I know who you are.
You have one weakness.
It's why you skulk.
Even in your most solid form, you cannot exist when there are no...
Shadows!
- I thought that would work...
- You thought correctly.
You just need a boost to the voltage!
You have not seen the last of us.
Yeah, I get that a lot.
No, he still has April's heart!
For God's sake!
I don't care how you do it, but save her heart.
Sacrifice yourself if you must!
- I have no choice but to obey, Master.
- Don't call me that!
I shall take my heart with me.
Do something with your laser pointer!
It's a screwdriver.
WHIRRING What will you do, Doctor?
Kill us both or let us both live?
Those are your choices.
April!
Duck.
Who says you're the only one who gets to make the decisions?
I will find you!
- That was very brave.
- He killed her.
He did even think about it.
He just...
Will he live?
Yes, yes, he will.
But the more interesting question is, what are we going to do with you lot?
That opening the Shadow Kin came through, you couldn't close it all the way.
Well, obviously, there's been so much artron energy around good old Coal Hill that time itself has worn thin.
I bet they didn't take that into account when they renovated.
And it can only be patched up so well.
Even by me.
So, those things will come back?
Well, they'll have to find you first.
I scrambled the pulsation.
Of course, Cole Hill will continue to act like a beacon across all of space-time, to any being who might want to make mischief with it.
So, you will have to be on your guard.
What?
No, no, no.
I thought you were going to get us out of here?
Why would you be safer somewhere else?
Time has looked at your faces.
And time... time... never forgets.
OK, Doctor.
Hey, hey, listen.
Um...
All right, these people...
Yes, they may disgust me, but at the end of the day, they're just children.
- They can't cope with this.
- I think that they have shown some rather extraordinary spirit, don't you?
A willingness to sacrifice themselves to save others.
Resourcefulness.
Bravery.
And, yes...
An absolute understanding of how precious life is.
You got your leg back?
I had some spares in the medical bay.
The Lothan - giant centipedes - experts in prosthetic legs.
You'll get the hang of it.
You just have to train it to act like your own leg.
What about football?
Unbelievably boring sport.
Now, darts...
Darts is something worth practising for.
Maths and alcoholic beverages.
The best way to spend a morning.
No, wait.
Wait...
You can't seriously expect these juveniles to deal with whatever is going to come through these tears in space and time?
- Through the what?
- It's like the Hellmouth.
- Or that town in Once Upon A Time.
- Or The Vampire Diaries.
- You watch Vampire Diaries?
- Everyone is very attractive.
Yes, it's true.
Well, they won't be on their own.
No...
No, no, please...
It is bad enough that I am a slave to that... prince.
You have committed a crime and you will be punished.
No, I was a freedom fighter for my people.
We were oppressed by...
You know what I'm talking about.
I can't be everywhere.
So!
You will help these amazing humans here... and these amazing humans will help you.
How?
I can't fire weapons!
I can't use swords and knives and screwdrivers!
Your brain, Miss Quill.
Best weapon there is.
Look at you!
What an amazing team!
You'll be able to handle anything that time throws at you.
Come on!
Cheer up!
It's not that hard.
It's no harder than all these exams that you have to take these days.
Except for Media Studies.
It's going to be harder than that.
So, are we all, like, mates, then?
I'm sorry.
About your heart.
We'll get it back - promise.
It feels so strange.
But maybe I'll be able to see if those things come back.
You're remarkably calm about this.
We'll be living on a knife edge.
All life is on a knife edge.
My mum, she was paralysed in a car accident and she should've died, but she didn't.
She adjusted and I will, too.
I'll see you Monday.
She's probably not going to let us out of our homework.
So...
How was it?
Tell me everything.
I'd, um... have to say it was... uneventful.
Hey.
Hey.
You OK?
I don't think I'll ever be OK.
I'm so sorry about Rachel.
Look, I'm sorry...
I don't mean to...
Don't worry.
I don't want to be alone, either.
How...?
How are you not deranged with grief for your people as I am for mine?
How does the rage not consume your life at every waking moment?
How do you know it doesn't?
A prince can't simply run around being furious.
A prince is... responsible for his people.
What do you mean?
You...
The Cabinet of Souls IS empty?
I wish it wasn't as much as you.
Shame.
We could have killed them.
We could have killed them all.
Committing one genocide for another.
Were you ever going to let that stop you?
It wouldn't stop me.
Do you know the feeling of dread?
- Has something happened?
- I saw something.
It was horrible.
Like, really horrible.
Who are you?
What are you doing here?
The Doctor said you're supposed to help us.
You're my protector.
Too easy, posh-o.
It's like pushing over a lamb.
Kevin never got home last night.
Everyone knows students at this school disappear, they all just pretend it isn't happening.
Tanya?
Are you coming to help decorate later?
We need volunteers.
- My mum says I'm too young.
- But its for year 12.
Technically you qualify, despite, you know, being, like, two years ahead.
How old are you, anyway?
Oh, because that question never gets old!
I think I'm going to ask Charlie to the prom.
And you just made us fail the Bechdel test.
The what?
You're funny!
Besides, I don't think the new kid is into...
- Wait, prom is tomorrow.
- Mm-hm.
You don't have a date yet?
So that's a yes to helping me decorate.
How would one dress?
Well, the boys wear dinner jackets and the girls wear ballgowns, but you don't need to be that gender specific.
I don't know what you did in your last job, but...
I am not a baby-sitter.
Except... you kind of... are.
Anyway... about the p... prom.
Um...
I was thinking that maybe you and I could...
You know.
Oh!
Er...
No.
I shouldn't think so.
Ha!
That was painful.
Look at you all.
The cream of the crop.
High achievers.
No wonder this country only exports Downton Abbey.
- I like Downton Abbey.
- Of course YOU like it.
It's a bunch of white people being nice to each other.
You'd watch it if Idris Elba were in it.
Are we cheating already, Charles?
You haven't actually taught us anything yet.
True.
So how about our first lesson of the day?
Your teacher has awful butterfingers.
You can't do that!
That's his private property.
April Maclean, the answer to the question are spinsters born or made?
You got a date for the prom yet?
Pretty sure you're not allowed to ask that.
- I've got a date.
- Of course, Ram.
The boy who hears silent applause every time he walks into a room.
Solve it.
- Don't look so pained, Matteusz.
- Is this even in the book?
I honestly think she makes this stuff up.
It's the Gibbs probability density in a classical Klein-Gordon field.
Well, it is.
We're not supposed to understand it.
She just wants us to feel stupid.
I bet she ate that missing kid.
He was eaten?
Where are you from anyway?
You sound like the Queen.
I'm from Sheffield.
Why am I even talking to you geeks?
Don't make me put you in detention, Ram.
You wouldn't like it.
The big decoration tonight.
All volunteers are welcome.
Big decorations night.
Autumn Ball.
All volunteers are welcome.
All volunteers are welcome.
Big decoration tonight.
Here you are.
Need you.
Come and help me.
Anyone?
Heya.
Having a date to the prom is important, yes?
Um...
Yeah.
I shall ask Matteusz as my date.
Oh...
Oh!
Is this not right?
No, no, no...
The schools in Sheffield are very different.
No, it's great.
It's... it's fantastic.
And it totally makes sense.
Good for you.
- Thank you.
- OK.
Of course he is.
Of course.
- On the left!
- Through!
- Open!
Move!
- Open!
I've got it!
- Yes!
- Come on!
Ram!
Come on!
Get the ball!
Quick, quick!
Open!
What the hell was that?
!
- Coach...
- 20 laps.
Now.
- What for?
- 25.
Get a move on.
No.
No.
Why would you help decorate something that you can't even go to?
Because that sad individual is probably the only chance you have at a friend.
Yeah, I'm under far too much pressure.
Tell me about it.
- Just a minute.
- All right.
I'll have some of this.
It's two-for-one...
Still weird to see without your uniform, Tanya.
- I'm in sixth form now.
- Overachiever.
I caught my husband fiddling with himself on the stairs.
Thank you.
I'm home.
You took your own sweet time.
Hello?
You're usually done by now.
Hello to you too.
Mum, you know this prom at school...
You're too young to be dancing with boys.
But I'm technically...
Your brain is smart enough to have allowed you to skip ahead, but you are still a little girl.
One who isn't even finished with her homework.
- Work fast.
Fun is for later.
- When, when I'm 40?
What's the matter?
Why are you upset?
Perhaps a better question is why aren't you?
All the time, at every moment.
Did you kill that student?
I saw burn marks that look like they were from your gun.
'Take it!
'
Now, you know as well as I do I'm not allowed to use my gun.
You'd find a way, some loophole.
Did you kill that student?
Yes.
Yes!
I tricked that student into using my gun to kill himself.
I also may not lie to you, remember?
And as long as I am forced to perform this slavery...
Punishment.
"To-may-to, to-ma-to".
I will keep you safe, but you will NOT...
question me!
Where are you going?
What did I just say?
You have to shoot it!
I can't use the gun!
Shoot it!
Shoot it now!
This just means that I can do it the way that I want it.
Whatever you say.
Look, I'm going to meet a friend for a...
"granola and kale falafel".
God, how Shoreditch has changed.
Can I trust you with this?
Of course I can trust you with this.
I've just sat down.
I'm going out with Rachel later.
I need the answers now.
Have you paid into my gaming account?
Yes, you ridiculous nerd.
OK.
The first steps you take in breaking down the formula...
A... night... full... of promise.
I wonder if that's what prom means...
Weird.
- Like this?
- Yeah, exactly.
Isn't this great?
The two of us... talking about something other than what the white people are doing.
You tell anyone about this, you're dead.
I mean dead.
What was that?
No, is it promenade?
Hm...
Help!
There's nothing.
What did you see?
Was it a shadow?
What do you know about shadows?
- Tanya!
- Ram!
Help!
Anyone?
!
We're in terrible danger.
No, I'm telling you, I'm seeing it right now.
There's someone attacking her!
Wait...
What?
Tanya, what's your address?
I don't know!
Something with a 3 in it.
I think you know what waits for you here.
You think the same plan will work!
But I am what waits for you.
And I am war itself!
Run.
- Where is the prince?
- Prince?
The singer?
Oh, shit!
Shit!
I can't use the gun, but you can do it, please!
More lights, Tanya.
Get rid of all the shadows.
Well, obviously!
No!
- No, please!
No!
- No!
It's part of your shadow!
Just shoot it!
Shoot it now, or it'll kill us both!
April, no!
Did you kill it?
I don't...
What is going on in here?
!
You're talking to a boy.
April?
April?
April?
Are you hurt?
Don't think so.
What the hell did you do?
- Corakinus.
- They found us.
Something is not right.
Now, that's interesting.
What's interesting?
What is that thing?
It's a displacement gun.
One of the few things in time and space able to kill a Shadow Kin.
It hits both target and shooter, tearing the body apart, scattering to the far corners of the universe, taking the Shadow Kin with it.
But Prince Valiant here had to get all heroic and you must've got a glancing blow.
I'm guessing that's a Shadow Kin.
More than that.
He's the king of the Shadow Kin.
That's not an encouraging look.
It sent his heart out into space, which should have killed him but...
You both now share April's heart.
God knows, it big enough.
What's she talking about?
I think your heart is phasing in and out of space-time, because he wants you.
He wants your...
You cannot kill me without killing the girl, too.
Not a problem.
Kill him, your Highness.
You...
What?
I will not.
What?
You would hesitate from killing the leader of the Shadow Kin?
!
I would hesitate from killing a friend.
This is not over.
It isn't.
We've got a problem.
- Are you OK?
- I'm not supposed to talk to you.
- You just got attacked by a shadow.
- Yeah, I know.
We have an enemy to fight.
Who's not here at the moment.
Look, we were told to keep our heads down and not cause any excitement.
- Wait a minute.
- What was that thing?
Shadow Kin, you ludicrous Care Bear.
Is this how little attention you pay in class, too?
All right, all right.
Look...
Would you believe me if I... if I said I was from another... planet?
God, yeah.
You're weird and don't know anything about pop culture.
You either alien or Amish.
I'm totally not prejudiced.
I come from a planet more beautiful than you could ever believe.
We.
We come from that planet.
It was paradise.
So, not Sheffield, then.
My people were the Rhodia.
We were a cultured, learned society.
- Can you picture it?
- Sort of.
I think I banged my head when I fell.
Well, go on.
Tell her.
He was their prince.
You were a prince?
No wonder you're strange.
I am a prince, just... without a people.
We were at war when it happened.
War against the Quill.
Our teacher here was the Quill's leading terrorist.
Freedom fighter.
The Quill lived on the smaller of the southern continents.
They mismanaged their economy and grew resentful of our success.
The Rhodia ate up all the planets resources, including those of the Quill, and then they were surprised when we objected.
We tried to help you!
By making us so dependent that we could never recover.
Hang on a minute.
Do you always look like this or were you totally all alien and had to modify your appearance to look human?
No.
Why do you ask?
It doesn't matter.
We won.
And the Rhodia have a particularly cruel punishment.
It is just.
They release a creature into your skull called an ahn.
Something about the size of two of your weirdly large human thumbs placed together.
Now imagine it with teeth and claws, digging into your brain, each claw tipped with poison.
Oh, and that's the nice bit.
It telepathically links you to a particular Rhodia, and you become their slave.
- Their servant.
- It is slavery.
It is punishment.
You can't...
If I use a weapon other than my own hands, the ahn kills me.
Yet, if I fail to protect you, I am also killed.
If I tried to remove the ahn, dead again.
- Slavery.
- Our tormentors become our protectors.
The leader of the Quill bound the future leader of the Rhodia.
What more civilised punishment could there be?
What does this have to do with the shadow people?
We were so busy fighting amongst ourselves, we never saw them coming.
They can exist as pure shadow... living unnoticed and untouchable in yours.
In this form, they can only be killed if you are.
Which is why the gun is set to shoot both ways.
They'll invade an entire world before anyone even knows they're there.
They only need to be in their solid form for the briefest of moments.
Because why would you fear your own shadow?
They killed everyone.
Everyone.
Rhodia and Quill alike.
A planet of three billion, all gone in... one day.
They killed my mother.
You two survived.
I saved you.
Run!
Agh!
Come on!
And I saved you.
How did you escape?
We were rescued.
By a figure of legend out of space and time itself.
Whatever.
Arrangements were made.
We were told to try and fit in and tell people we were from Sheffield.
I don't understand how they found us.
That opening Corakinus crawled back into.
Are they coming to kill our planet?
I mean, my planet, I guess.
This isn't how they invade.
This is different.
They're clearly looking for us.
Unfinished business.
- We should leave.
- No.
They'll follow us wherever we go.
I won't spend the rest of my life on the run.
Oh, and yet you hesitate to take your revenge.
Revenge?
April.
April.
What's happening to her?
Why are you standing there?
!
- Do something!
- I see them.
I can hear his thoughts.
He wants you.
He wants something you have.
The gun?
He's coming for tomorrow night.
I'm going to have to cancel prom.
No, no.
If they want to kill everyone, they'll just slide into our shadows and do it at home.
Great.
Die alone or die at a party.
Plus, if we're all here, it's the best chance we'll have of getting your heart back.
You said that you could hear his thoughts.
It's gone now, but for a minute...
For a minute.
Well, for a minute he could probably read yours.
They've obviously connected because of the heart.
I told you we should kill her.
No-one is killing her.
Leave us!
We are decorating.
If you see anything more, you tell us immediately.
OK?
Oh, thank God you said that.
I'd have just kept it to myself.
Just be careful of your shadows at the prom tonight, OK?
What have you seen?
Could you believe all that stuff?
Aliens, and Charlie being a prince?
I don't know.
I was attacked by a shadow.
Kind of opens your mind a little bit.
You take care.
You hear?
Thanks.
Ahem... you, too.
Why don't you tell your mum the prom's being assigned as a sociology module?
You look gorgeous!
I don't, but thanks.
- April!
- People just think that nice means fragile.
That somehow if I'm allowed to see what the real world's like, then I'll break, but...
I'm tougher than they think.
I know how tough you are.
And you're not nice.
You're kind.
There's a difference.
But kind is better.
Way better.
Yeah, cos that's what people think when they want a prom date.
"Oh, I wonder who's kind?"
April, just because you have to do a lot for me...
I don't mind.
Doesn't mean I stop being your mum.
You do look gorgeous.
And that's that.
Hello.
Everything all right?
Oh, yeah.
My deeply religious parents are very happy I'm going to dance with a boy.
This has been in evening of love and warmth.
Great.
You are a very strange person.
She's got a driver?
Uber, Dad.
Practice in the morning.
Oh, my God!
If you tell me one more time, I might literally go insane.
Don't abuse the word literally.
It's a good word that young people squander.
What's that, Dad?
Have a good time tonight?
Well, thanks, I'm sure I will.
You're facing a very important step in your future soon.
You have no idea what I'm facing, Dad.
What?
- What are you facing?
- See you later, Dad.
Have fun.
You look amazing.
You, too.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Get some space between you.
Honestly!
Is that all you people think about?
Look at all of these people!
Oh, this is going to look so good for my university application.
Do you not have a date?
Is OK.
You can dance with us.
How are you feeling?
How's your... heart?
Weird, but OK.
I keep getting really short of breath, but I'm adjusting to it.
It's amazing what the body can get used to.
I do not understand these signs.
Come on, let's dance.
For tonight, we might die.
Are you all right?
OK, seriously, what is wrong with you?
Hey, Ram!
Looking good, man.
Nothing, just nerves.
The great Ram Singh, nervous?
Tanya!
I thought your mum wouldn't let you come.
Yeah, I told her missing this would stunt my interpersonal development.
I have to write an essay about it, though.
Although, actually, it might be quite interesting.
Wow.
That's how you do a prom.
I'm dressed really nice...
All right?
And we're changing the tune, now.
We've got some nice ones coming your way...
- That was such a good one!
- You look so good.
- I'm going to go to the toilet.
- I'll come with you.
OK.
Anything?
Yes, there was a huge attack I'm keeping secret from you.
I should've put a creature in your head to make you nicer.
- Yeah, should've, but didn't.
- Hmm.
If there is any trouble, the gun is set for you.
Something is happening to your friend.
Help, April!
April!
Is she epileptic?
Do we need to call an ambulance?
What do you see?
They're opening... the tear.
Is that a bad thing?
You don't have to prove anything to me, Ram.
What?
I know that you've got the whole sporting ego thing going on, but I like you because I know that, deep down, that's not true.
Now, will you please let me go to the...
Where is... the prince?
!
The prince?
!
- No!
- What?
Oh, no.
You killed her!
Where is the prince?
Did you hire a band?
We need to get everybody out.
Where are all the teachers?
!
Move along, please.
Boyfriend dumped her on prom night.
I must be allergic to the punch!
- You're all in danger.
- You have to go!
Please, you've got to get out!
Stop ignoring me!
There's a fire and you've got to get out of the building or you're going to die.
Get out!
Oh!
For God's sake!
I will ask you one last time.
Where is the prince?
I am the prince!
Whoa!
Will none of you people listen to niceness ever?
!
Turn the music back on!
You'd listen to me if I was some A-hole telling you how fat you looked on Instagram!
Do they do this at American proms?
All right.
Yeah, back up.
Listen!
- You're all in grave danger.
- From what?
From the smoke.
You killed her!
- April, come here.
- Come on, let's go.
- We have to close that rift.
- Oh, is that where we're going wrong?
The Prince of Rhodia and his little pet.
Kill him.
Kill him!
- Ha-ha, you know why I'm here, Prince.
- You can't have it.
Then we'll just have to cover this planet in shadow, too.
No, you won't.
You won't kill me because you'll die yourself.
There is enough time of possibilities other than death.
Argh!
April!
No!
They've locked us in.
We're trapped!
Stop it.
You've got what you wanted.
Just go!
I've not yet got what I wanted.
Well, nothing left to do, then, is there, but to die well.
You know, I never thought that was possible.
Dying well.
Who wants to die well?
Surely, the aim should be NOT dying well?
You.
- You.
- Who?
- Who?
- Who?
Oh, this is a bit of a mess, isn't it?
I used to be the caretaker here, you know?
Before it got all fancy.
This is going to be quite a clean-up job.
You've heard of me, haven't you?
You are the great destruction of the universe.
Yes, but most people just call me the Doctor.
There was something I wanted to ask you...
Oh, yes!
What exactly do you think you're doing here?
We might ask you the same question.
Fair enough.
It's just that I seem to have a soft spot for people who are the last of their species, which you have made my friends here.
I found them a home, but they were supposed to live quietly.
Plus... they called.
We've got a problem.
This is not your normal modus operandi.
You invade in secret.
And you kill all at once.
You don't just pour in like any old boring army!
Bit inelegant for the Shadow Kin, isn't it?
We are here... for the Cabinet.
Oh, the Cabinet!
Oh, that's easy.
There's this painfully strange shop here called Ikea...
The Cabinet of Souls.
What's the Cabinet of Souls?
It's the centre of Rhodian religion.
The soul of every Rhodian who dies is supposed to go there.
It's a repository for a future paradise.
And a weapon.
Yes.
That, too.
It's the power of all that life crammed down into single specks of light.
It could be enough to destroy an entire species.
- He can use it against us.
- Yes.
- Yes, and who would blame him?
- I would.
Why avenge genocide with genocide?
Why avenge?
Trust me...
It doesn't matter.
The Cabinet is empty.
I knew it would be.
Every Rhodian does.
It's just bedtime stories for children to make death less scary.
As if death should be anything but terrifying.
Then why would you take it?
I kept it in memory of my people.
All my people who are gone!
Yes.
That is a crime that has not yet been answered for.
And who will make me?
You are powerful... but we are a legion.
You leave... or I'll make you leave.
What's going on here?
You have been very busy here, haven't you?
- One heart.
Two people.
- It's why you can't kill me.
But I can.
You leave...
- or you die.
- April, no.
If you came for me, take me.
Leave these people alone.
Weren't any of you listening when I talked about not dying well?
- No-one else is dying here today.
- We disagree.
Tell me, Corakinus...
Yes, I know who you are.
You have one weakness.
It's why you skulk.
Even in your most solid form, you cannot exist when there are no...
Shadows!
- I thought that would work...
- You thought correctly.
You just need a boost to the voltage!
You have not seen the last of us.
Yeah, I get that a lot.
No, he still has April's heart!
Oh, for God's sake!
I don't care how you do it, but save her heart.
Sacrifice yourself if you must!
- I have no choice but to obey, Master.
- Don't call me that!
I shall take my heart with me.
Do something with your laser pointer!
It's a screwdriver.
What will you do, Doctor?
Kill us both or let us both live?
Those are your choices.
April!
Duck.
Who says you're the only one who gets to make the decisions?
I will find you!
- That was very brave.
- He killed her.
He did even think about it.
He just...
Will he live?
Yes, yes, he will.
But the more interesting question is, what are we going to do with you lot?
That opening the Shadow Kin came through,
- you couldn't close it all the way.
- Well, obviously, there's been so much artron energy around good old Coal Hill that time itself has worn thin.
I bet they didn't take that into account when they renovated.
And it can only be patched up so well.
Even by me.
So, those things will come back?
Well, they'll have to find you first.
I scrambled the pulsation.
Of course, Cole Hill will continue to act like a beacon across all of space-time, to any being who might want to make mischief with it.
So, you will have to be on your guard.
What?
No, no, no.
I thought you were going to get us out of here?
Why would you be safer somewhere else?
Time has looked at your faces.
And time... time... never forgets.
OK, Doctor.
Hey, hey, listen.
Um...
All right, these people...
Yes, they may disgust me, but at the end of the day, they're just children.
- They can't cope with this.
- I think that they have shown some rather extraordinary spirit, don't you?
A willingness to sacrifice themselves to save others.
Resourcefulness.
Bravery.
And, oh, yes...
An absolute understanding of how precious life is.
- You got your leg back?
- I had some spares in the medical bay.
The Lothan, giant centipedes, experts in prosthetic legs.
You'll get the hang of it.
You just have to train it to act like your own leg.
What about football?
Unbelievably boring sport.
Now, darts...
Darts is something worth practising for.
Maths and alcoholic beverages.
The best way to spend a morning.
No, wait.
Wait...
You can't seriously expect these juveniles to deal with whatever is going to come through these tears in space and time?
- Through the what?
- It's like the Hellmouth.
- Or that town in Once Upon A Time.
- Or The Vampire Diaries.
- You watch Vampire Diaries?
- Everyone is very attractive.
Yes, it's true.
Well, they won't be on their own.
Oh, no...
No, no, please...
It is bad enough that I am a slave to that... prince.
You have committed a crime and you will be punished.
No, I was a freedom fighter for my people.
- We were oppressed by...
- You know what I'm talking about.
- Oh...
- Hm...
I can't be everywhere.
So!
You will help these amazing humans here... and these amazing humans will help you.
How?
I can't fire weapons!
I can't use swords and knives and screwdrivers!
Your brain, Miss Quill.
Best weapon there is.
Look at you!
What an amazing team!
You'll be able to handle anything that time throws at you.
Oh, come on!
Cheer up!
It's not that hard.
It's no harder than all these exams that you have to take these days.
Except for Media Studies.
It's going to be harder than that.
So, are we all, like, mates, then?
I'm sorry.
About your heart.
We'll get it back, promise.
It feels so strange.
But maybe I'll be able to see if those things come back.
You're remarkably calm about this.
We'll be living on a knife edge.
All life is on a knife edge.
My mum, she was paralysed in a car accident and she should've died, but she didn't.
She adjusted and I will, too.
I'll see you Monday.
She's probably not going to let us out of our homework.
So...
How was it?
Tell me everything.
I'd, um... have to say it was... uneventful.
Hey.
Hey.
You OK?
I don't think I'll ever be OK.
I'm so sorry about Rachel.
Look, I'm sorry...
I don't mean to...
Don't worry.
I don't want to be alone, either.
How...?
How are you not deranged with grief for your people as I am for mine?
How does the rage not consume your life at every waking moment?
How do you know it doesn't?
A prince can't simply run around being furious.
A prince is... responsible for his people.
What do you mean?
You...
The Cabinet of Souls IS empty?
I wish it wasn't as much as you.
Shame.
We could have killed them.
We could have killed them all.
Committing one genocide for another.
Were you ever going to let that stop you?
It wouldn't stop me.
Do you know the feeling of dread?
- Has something happened?
- I saw something.
It was horrible.
Like, really horrible.
Who are you?
What are you doing here?
The Doctor said you're supposed to help us.
You're my protector.
Too easy, posh-o.
It's like pushing over a lamb.
Kevin never got home last night.
Everyone knows students at this school disappear, they all just pretend it isn't happening.
Tanya?
Are you coming to help decorate later?
We need volunteers.
- My mum says I'm too young.
- But its for year 12.
Technically you qualify, despite, you know, being, like, two years ahead.
How old are you, anyway?
Oh, because that question never gets old!
I think I'm going to ask Charlie to the prom.
And you just made us fail the Bechdel test.
The what?
You're funny!
Besides, I don't think the new kid is into...
- Wait, prom is tomorrow.
- Mm-hm.
You don't have a date yet?
So that's a yes to helping me decorate.
How would one dress?
Well, the boys wear dinner jackets and the girls wear ballgowns, but you don't need to be that gender specific.
I don't know what you did in your last job, but...
I am not a baby-sitter.
Except... you kind of... are.
Anyway... about the p... prom.
Um...
I was thinking that maybe you and I could...
You know.
Oh!
Er...
No.
I shouldn't think so.
Ha!
That was painful.
Look at you all.
The cream of the crop.
High achievers.
No wonder this country only exports Downton Abbey.
- I like Downton Abbey.
- Of course YOU like it.
It's a bunch of white people being nice to each other.
You'd watch it if Idris Elba were in it.
Are we cheating already, Charles?
You haven't actually taught us anything yet.
True.
So how about our first lesson of the day?
Your teacher has awful butterfingers.
You can't do that!
That's his private property.
April Maclean, the answer to the question are spinsters born or made?
You got a date for the prom yet?
Pretty sure you're not allowed to ask that.
- I've got a date.
- Of course, Ram.
The boy who hears silent applause every time he walks into a room.
Solve it.
- Don't look so pained, Matteusz.
- Is this even in the book?
I honestly think she makes this stuff up.
It's the Gibbs probability density in a classical Klein-Gordon field.
Well, it is.
We're not supposed to understand it.
She just wants us to feel stupid.
I bet she ate that missing kid.
He was eaten?
Where are you from anyway?
You sound like the Queen.
I'm from Sheffield.
Why am I even talking to you geeks?
Don't make me put you in detention, Ram.
You wouldn't like it.
The big decoration tonight.
All volunteers are welcome.
Big decorations night.
Autumn Ball.
All volunteers are welcome.
All volunteers are welcome.
Big decoration tonight.
Here you are.
Need you.
Come and help me.
Anyone?
Heya.
Having a date to the prom is important, yes?
Um...
Yeah.
I shall ask Matteusz as my date.
Oh...
Oh!
Is this not right?
No, no, no...
The schools in Sheffield are very different.
No, it's great.
It's... it's fantastic.
And it totally makes sense.
Good for you.
- Thank you.
- OK.
Of course he is.
Of course.
- On the left!
- Through!
- Open!
Move!
- Open!
I've got it!
- Yes!
- Come on!
Ram!
Come on!
Get the ball!
Quick, quick!
Open!
What the hell was that?
!
- Coach...
- 20 laps.
Now.
- What for?
- 25.
Get a move on.
No.
No.
Why would you help decorate something that you can't even go to?
Because that sad individual is probably the only chance you have at a friend.
Yeah, I'm under far too much pressure.
Tell me about it.
- Just a minute.
- All right.
I'll have some of this.
It's two-for-one...
Still weird to see without your uniform, Tanya.
- I'm in sixth form now.
- Overachiever.
I caught my husband fiddling with himself on the stairs.
Thank you.
I'm home.
You took your own sweet time.
Hello?
You're usually done by now.
Hello to you too.
Mum, you know this prom at school...
You're too young to be dancing with boys.
But I'm technically...
Your brain is smart enough to have allowed you to skip ahead, but you are still a little girl.
One who isn't even finished with her homework.
- Work fast.
Fun is for later.
- When, when I'm 40?
What's the matter?
Why are you upset?
Perhaps a better question is why aren't you?
All the time, at every moment.
Did you kill that student?
I saw burn marks that look like they were from your gun.
'Take it!
'
Now, you know as well as I do I'm not allowed to use my gun.
You'd find a way, some loophole.
Did you kill that student?
Yes.
Yes!
I tricked that student into using my gun to kill himself.
I also may not lie to you, remember?
And as long as I am forced to perform this slavery...
Punishment.
"To-may-to, to-ma-to".
I will keep you safe, but you will NOT...
question me!
Where are you going?
What did I just say?
You have to shoot it!
I can't use the gun!
Shoot it!
Shoot it now!
This just means that I can do it the way that I want it.
Whatever you say.
Look, I'm going to meet a friend for a...
"granola and kale falafel".
God, how Shoreditch has changed.
Can I trust you with this?
Of course I can trust you with this.
I've just sat down.
I'm going out with Rachel later.
I need the answers now.
Have you paid into my gaming account?
Yes, you ridiculous nerd.
OK.
The first steps you take in breaking down the formula...
A... night... full... of promise.
I wonder if that's what prom means...
Weird.
- Like this?
- Yeah, exactly.
Isn't this great?
The two of us... talking about something other than what the white people are doing.
You tell anyone about this, you're dead.
I mean dead.
What was that?
No, is it promenade?
Hm...
Help!
There's nothing.
What did you see?
Was it a shadow?
What do you know about shadows?
- Tanya!
- Ram!
Help!
Anyone?
!
We're in terrible danger.
No, I'm telling you, I'm seeing it right now.
There's someone attacking her!
Wait...
What?
Tanya, what's your address?
I don't know!
Something with a 3 in it.
I think you know what waits for you here.
You think the same plan will work!
But I am what waits for you.
And I am war itself!
Run.
- Where is the prince?
- Prince?
The singer?
Oh, shit!
Shit!
I can't use the gun, but you can do it, please!
More lights, Tanya.
Get rid of all the shadows.
Well, obviously!
No!
- No, please!
No!
- No!
It's part of your shadow!
Just shoot it!
Shoot it now, or it'll kill us both!
April, no!
Did you kill it?
I don't...
What is going on in here?
!
You're talking to a boy.
April?
April?
April?
Are you hurt?
Don't think so.
What the hell did you do?
- Corakinus.
- They found us.
Something is not right.
Now, that's interesting.
What's interesting?
What is that thing?
It's a displacement gun.
One of the few things in time and space able to kill a Shadow Kin.
It hits both target and shooter, tearing the body apart, scattering to the far corners of the universe, taking the Shadow Kin with it.
But Prince Valiant here had to get all heroic and you must've got a glancing blow.
I'm guessing that's a Shadow Kin.
More than that.
He's the king of the Shadow Kin.
That's not an encouraging look.
It sent his heart out into space, which should have killed him but...
You both now share April's heart.
God knows, it big enough.
What's she talking about?
I think your heart is phasing in and out of space-time, because he wants you.
He wants your...
You cannot kill me without killing the girl, too.
Not a problem.
Kill him, your Highness.
You...
What?
I will not.
What?
You would hesitate from killing the leader of the Shadow Kin?
!
I would hesitate from killing a friend.
This is not over.
It isn't.
We've got a problem.
- Are you OK?
- I'm not supposed to talk to you.
- You just got attacked by a shadow.
- Yeah, I know.
We have an enemy to fight.
Who's not here at the moment.
Look, we were told to keep our heads down and not cause any excitement.
- Wait a minute.
- What was that thing?
Shadow Kin, you ludicrous Care Bear.
Is this how little attention you pay in class, too?
All right, all right.
Look...
Would you believe me if I... if I said I was from another... planet?
God, yeah.
You're weird and don't know anything about pop culture.
You either alien or Amish.
I'm totally not prejudiced.
I come from a planet more beautiful than you could ever believe.
We.
We come from that planet.
It was paradise.
So, not Sheffield, then.
My people were the Rhodia.
We were a cultured, learned society.
- Can you picture it?
- Sort of.
I think I banged my head when I fell.
Well, go on.
Tell her.
He was their prince.
You were a prince?
No wonder you're strange.
I am a prince, just... without a people.
We were at war when it happened.
War against the Quill.
Our teacher here was the Quill's leading terrorist.
Freedom fighter.
The Quill lived on the smaller of the southern continents.
They mismanaged their economy and grew resentful of our success.
The Rhodia ate up all the planets resources, including those of the Quill, and then they were surprised when we objected.
We tried to help you!
By making us so dependent that we could never recover.
Hang on a minute.
Do you always look like this or were you totally all alien and had to modify your appearance to look human?
No.
Why do you ask?
It doesn't matter.
We won.
And the Rhodia have a particularly cruel punishment.
It is just.
They release a creature into your skull called an ahn.
Something about the size of two of your weirdly large human thumbs placed together.
Now imagine it with teeth and claws, digging into your brain, each claw tipped with poison.
Oh, and that's the nice bit.
It telepathically links you to a particular Rhodia, and you become their slave.
- Their servant.
- It is slavery.
It is punishment.
You can't...
If I use a weapon other than my own hands, the ahn kills me.
Yet, if I fail to protect you, I am also killed.
If I tried to remove the ahn, dead again.
- Slavery.
- Our tormentors become our protectors.
The leader of the Quill bound the future leader of the Rhodia.
What more civilised punishment could there be?
What does this have to do with the shadow people?
We were so busy fighting amongst ourselves, we never saw them coming.
They can exist as pure shadow... living unnoticed and untouchable in yours.
In this form, they can only be killed if you are.
Which is why the gun is set to shoot both ways.
They'll invade an entire world before anyone even knows they're there.
They only need to be in their solid form for the briefest of moments.
Because why would you fear your own shadow?
They killed everyone.
Everyone.
Rhodia and Quill alike.
A planet of three billion, all gone in... one day.
They killed my mother.
You two survived.
I saved you.
Run!
Agh!
Come on!
And I saved you.
How did you escape?
We were rescued.
By a figure of legend out of space and time itself.
Whatever.
Arrangements were made.
We were told to try and fit in and tell people we were from Sheffield.
I don't understand how they found us.
That opening Corakinus crawled back into.
Are they coming to kill our planet?
I mean, my planet, I guess.
This isn't how they invade.
This is different.
They're clearly looking for us.
Unfinished business.
- We should leave.
- No.
They'll follow us wherever we go.
I won't spend the rest of my life on the run.
Oh, and yet you hesitate to take your revenge.
Revenge?
April.
April.
What's happening to her?
Why are you standing there?
!
- Do something!
- I see them.
I can hear his thoughts.
He wants you.
He wants something you have.
The gun?
He's coming for tomorrow night.
I'm going to have to cancel prom.
No, no.
If they want to kill everyone, they'll just slide into our shadows and do it at home.
Great.
Die alone or die at a party.
Plus, if we're all here, it's the best chance we'll have of getting your heart back.
You said that you could hear his thoughts.
It's gone now, but for a minute...
For a minute.
Well, for a minute he could probably read yours.
They've obviously connected because of the heart.
I told you we should kill her.
No-one is killing her.
Leave us!
We are decorating.
If you see anything more, you tell us immediately.
OK?
Oh, thank God you said that.
I'd have just kept it to myself.
Just be careful of your shadows at the prom tonight, OK?
What have you seen?
Could you believe all that stuff?
Aliens, and Charlie being a prince?
I don't know.
I was attacked by a shadow.
Kind of opens your mind a little bit.
You take care.
You hear?
Thanks.
Ahem... you, too.
Why don't you tell your mum the prom's being assigned as a sociology module?
You look gorgeous!
I don't, but thanks.
- April!
- People just think that nice means fragile.
That somehow if I'm allowed to see what the real world's like, then I'll break, but...
I'm tougher than they think.
I know how tough you are.
And you're not nice.
You're kind.
There's a difference.
But kind is better.
Way better.
Yeah, cos that's what people think when they want a prom date.
"Oh, I wonder who's kind?"
April, just because you have to do a lot for me...
I don't mind.
Doesn't mean I stop being your mum.
You do look gorgeous.
And that's that.
Hello.
Everything all right?
Oh, yeah.
My deeply religious parents are very happy I'm going to dance with a boy.
This has been in evening of love and warmth.
Great.
You are a very strange person.
She's got a driver?
Uber, Dad.
Practice in the morning.
Oh, my God!
If you tell me one more time, I might literally go insane.
Don't abuse the word literally.
It's a good word that young people squander.
What's that, Dad?
Have a good time tonight?
Well, thanks, I'm sure I will.
You're facing a very important step in your future soon.
You have no idea what I'm facing, Dad.
What?
- What are you facing?
- See you later, Dad.
Have fun.
You look amazing.
You, too.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Get some space between you.
Honestly!
Is that all you people think about?
Look at all of these people!
Oh, this is going to look so good for my university application.
Do you not have a date?
Is OK.
You can dance with us.
How are you feeling?
How's your... heart?
Weird, but OK.
I keep getting really short of breath, but I'm adjusting to it.
It's amazing what the body can get used to.
I do not understand these signs.
Come on, let's dance.
For tonight, we might die.
Are you all right?
OK, seriously, what is wrong with you?
Hey, Ram!
Looking good, man.
Nothing, just nerves.
The great Ram Singh, nervous?
Tanya!
I thought your mum wouldn't let you come.
Yeah, I told her missing this would stunt my interpersonal development.
I have to write an essay about it, though.
Although, actually, it might be quite interesting.
Wow.
That's how you do a prom.
I'm dressed really nice...
All right?
And we're changing the tune, now.
We've got some nice ones coming your way...
- That was such a good one!
- You look so good.
- I'm going to go to the toilet.
- I'll come with you.
OK.
Anything?
Yes, there was a huge attack I'm keeping secret from you.
I should've put a creature in your head to make you nicer.
- Yeah, should've, but didn't.
- Hmm.
If there is any trouble, the gun is set for you.
Something is happening to your friend.
Help, April!
April!
Is she epileptic?
Do we need to call an ambulance?
What do you see?
They're opening... the tear.
Is that a bad thing?
You don't have to prove anything to me, Ram.
What?
I know that you've got the whole sporting ego thing going on, but I like you because I know that, deep down, that's not true.
Now, will you please let me go to the...
Where is... the prince?
!
The prince?
!
- No!
- What?
Oh, no.
You killed her!
Where is the prince?
Did you hire a band?
We need to get everybody out.
Where are all the teachers?
!
Move along, please.
Boyfriend dumped her on prom night.
I must be allergic to the punch!
- You're all in danger.
- You have to go!
Please, you've got to get out!
Stop ignoring me!
There's a fire and you've got to get out of the building or you're going to die.
Get out!
Oh!
For God's sake!
I will ask you one last time.
Where is the prince?
I am the prince!
Whoa!
Will none of you people listen to niceness ever?
!
Turn the music back on!
You'd listen to me if I was some A-hole telling you how fat you looked on Instagram!
Do they do this at American proms?
All right.
Yeah, back up.
Listen!
- You're all in grave danger.
- From what?
From the smoke.
You killed her!
- April, come here.
- Come on, let's go.
- We have to close that rift.
- Oh, is that where we're going wrong?
The Prince of Rhodia and his little pet.
Kill him.
Kill him!
- Ha-ha, you know why I'm here, Prince.
- You can't have it.
Then we'll just have to cover this planet in shadow, too.
No, you won't.
You won't kill me because you'll die yourself.
There is enough time of possibilities other than death.
Argh!
April!
No!
They've locked us in.
We're trapped!
Stop it.
You've got what you wanted.
Just go!
I've not yet got what I wanted.
Well, nothing left to do, then, is there, but to die well.
You know, I never thought that was possible.
Dying well.
Who wants to die well?
Surely, the aim should be NOT dying well?
You.
- You.
- Who?
- Who?
- Who?
Oh, this is a bit of a mess, isn't it?
I used to be the caretaker here, you know?
Before it got all fancy.
This is going to be quite a clean-up job.
You've heard of me, haven't you?
You are the great destruction of the universe.
Yes, but most people just call me the Doctor.
There was something I wanted to ask you...
Oh, yes!
What exactly do you think you're doing here?
We might ask you the same question.
Fair enough.
It's just that I seem to have a soft spot for people who are the last of their species, which you have made my friends here.
I found them a home, but they were supposed to live quietly.
Plus... they called.
We've got a problem.
This is not your normal modus operandi.
You invade in secret.
And you kill all at once.
You don't just pour in like any old boring army!
Bit inelegant for the Shadow Kin, isn't it?
We are here... for the Cabinet.
Oh, the Cabinet!
Oh, that's easy.
There's this painfully strange shop here called Ikea...
The Cabinet of Souls.
What's the Cabinet of Souls?
It's the centre of Rhodian religion.
The soul of every Rhodian who dies is supposed to go there.
It's a repository for a future paradise.
And a weapon.
Yes.
That, too.
It's the power of all that life crammed down into single specks of light.
It could be enough to destroy an entire species.
- He can use it against us.
- Yes.
- Yes, and who would blame him?
- I would.
Why avenge genocide with genocide?
Why avenge?
Trust me...
It doesn't matter.
The Cabinet is empty.
I knew it would be.
Every Rhodian does.
It's just bedtime stories for children to make death less scary.
As if death should be anything but terrifying.
Then why would you take it?
I kept it in memory of my people.
All my people who are gone!
Yes.
That is a crime that has not yet been answered for.
And who will make me?
You are powerful... but we are a legion.
You leave... or I'll make you leave.
What's going on here?
You have been very busy here, haven't you?
- One heart.
Two people.
- It's why you can't kill me.
But I can.
You leave...
- or you die.
- April, no.
If you came for me, take me.
Leave these people alone.
Weren't any of you listening when I talked about not dying well?
- No-one else is dying here today.
- We disagree.
Tell me, Corakinus...
Yes, I know who you are.
You have one weakness.
It's why you skulk.
Even in your most solid form, you cannot exist when there are no...
Shadows!
- I thought that would work...
- You thought correctly.
You just need a boost to the voltage!
You have not seen the last of us.
Yeah, I get that a lot.
No, he still has April's heart!
Oh, for God's sake!
I don't care how you do it, but save her heart.
Sacrifice yourself if you must!
- I have no choice but to obey, Master.
- Don't call me that!
I shall take my heart with me.
Do something with your laser pointer!
It's a screwdriver.
What will you do, Doctor?
Kill us both or let us both live?
Those are your choices.
April!
Duck.
Who says you're the only one who gets to make the decisions?
I will find you!
- That was very brave.
- He killed her.
He did even think about it.
He just...
Will he live?
Yes, yes, he will.
But the more interesting question is, what are we going to do with you lot?
That opening the Shadow Kin came through,
- you couldn't close it all the way.
- Well, obviously, there's been so much artron energy around good old Coal Hill that time itself has worn thin.
I bet they didn't take that into account when they renovated.
And it can only be patched up so well.
Even by me.
So, those things will come back?
Well, they'll have to find you first.
I scrambled the pulsation.
Of course, Cole Hill will continue to act like a beacon across all of space-time, to any being who might want to make mischief with it.
So, you will have to be on your guard.
What?
No, no, no.
I thought you were going to get us out of here?
Why would you be safer somewhere else?
Time has looked at your faces.
And time... time... never forgets.
OK, Doctor.
Hey, hey, listen.
Um...
All right, these people...
Yes, they may disgust me, but at the end of the day, they're just children.
- They can't cope with this.
- I think that they have shown some rather extraordinary spirit, don't you?
A willingness to sacrifice themselves to save others.
Resourcefulness.
Bravery.
And, oh, yes...
An absolute understanding of how precious life is.
- You got your leg back?
- I had some spares in the medical bay.
The Lothan, giant centipedes, experts in prosthetic legs.
You'll get the hang of it.
You just have to train it to act like your own leg.
What about football?
Unbelievably boring sport.
Now, darts...
Darts is something worth practising for.
Maths and alcoholic beverages.
The best way to spend a morning.
No, wait.
Wait...
You can't seriously expect these juveniles to deal with whatever is going to come through these tears in space and time?
- Through the what?
- It's like the Hellmouth.
- Or that town in Once Upon A Time.
- Or The Vampire Diaries.
- You watch Vampire Diaries?
- Everyone is very attractive.
Yes, it's true.
Well, they won't be on their own.
Oh, no...
No, no, please...
It is bad enough that I am a slave to that... prince.
You have committed a crime and you will be punished.
No, I was a freedom fighter for my people.
We were oppressed by...
You know what I'm talking about.
- Oh...
- Hm...
I can't be everywhere.
So!
You will help these amazing humans here... and these amazing humans will help you.
How?
I can't fire weapons!
I can't use swords and knives and screwdrivers!
Your brain, Miss Quill.
Best weapon there is.
Look at you!
What an amazing team!
You'll be able to handle anything that time throws at you.
Oh, come on!
Cheer up!
It's not that hard.
It's no harder than all these exams that you have to take these days.
Except for Media Studies.
It's going to be harder than that.
So, are we all, like, mates, then?
I'm sorry.
About your heart.
We'll get it back, promise.
It feels so strange.
But maybe I'll be able to see if those things come back.
You're remarkably calm about this.
We'll be living on a knife edge.
All life is on a knife edge.
My mum, she was paralysed in a car accident and she should've died, but she didn't.
She adjusted and I will, too.
I'll see you Monday.
She's probably not going to let us out of our homework.
So...
How was it?
Tell me everything.
I'd, um... have to say it was... uneventful.
Hey.
Hey.
You OK?
I don't think I'll ever be OK.
I'm so sorry about Rachel.
Look, I'm sorry...
I don't mean to...
Don't worry.
I don't want to be alone, either.
How...?
How are you not deranged with grief for your people as I am for mine?
How does the rage not consume your life at every waking moment?
How do you know it doesn't?
A prince can't simply run around being furious.
A prince is... responsible for his people.
What do you mean?
You...
The Cabinet of Souls IS empty?
I wish it wasn't as much as you.
Shame.
We could have killed them.
We could have killed them all.
Committing one genocide for another.
Were you ever going to let that stop you?
It wouldn't stop me.
Do you know the feeling of dread?
- Has something happened?
- I saw something.
It was horrible.
Like, really horrible.
Who are you?
What are you doing here?
The Doctor said you're supposed to help us.
You're my protector.

- Like this?
- Yeah, exactly.
Isn't this great?
The two of us... talking about something other than what the white people are doing.
You tell anyone about this, you're dead.
I mean dead.
RUMBLING
What was that?
No, is it promenade?
Hm...
TENSE MUSIC
Help!
There's nothing.
What did you see?
Was it a shadow?
What do you know about shadows?
RUMBLING
- Tanya!
- Ram!
Help!
Anyone?
!
SHE GROANS
SHE BREATHES HEAVILY
We're in terrible danger.
No, I'm telling you, I'm seeing it right now.
There's someone attacking her!
- SHE GROANS
- Wait...
What?
Tanya, what's your address?
I don't know!
Something with a 3 in it.
I think you know what waits for you here.
You think the same plan will work!
But I am what waits for you.
And I am war itself!
Run.
- Where is the prince?
- Prince?
The singer?
Oh, shit!
Shit!
I can't use the gun, but you can do it, please!
More lights, Tanya.
Get rid of all the shadows.
Well, obviously!
SHE SCREAMS
No!
- No, please!
No!
- No!
It's part of your shadow!
Just shoot it!
Shoot it now, or it'll kill us both!
- April, no!
- HE GROANS
Did you kill it?
I don't...
What is going on in here?
!
You're talking to a boy.
April?
April?
April?
Are you hurt?
Don't think so.
What the hell did you do?
- Corakinus.
- They found us.
Something is not right.
GASPING
Now, that's interesting.
What's interesting?
What is that thing?
It's a displacement gun.
One of the few things in time and space able to kill a Shadow Kin.
It hits both target and shooter, tearing the body apart, scattering to the far corners of the universe, taking the Shadow Kin with it.
But Prince Valiant here had to get all heroic and you must've got a glancing blow.
I'm guessing that's a Shadow Kin.
More than that.
He's the king of the Shadow Kin.
That's not an encouraging look.
It sent his heart out into space, which should have killed him but...
You both now share April's heart.
God knows, it big enough.
What's she talking about?
I think your heart is phasing in and out of space-time, because he wants you.
He wants your...
SINISTER CHUCKLE
You cannot kill me without killing the girl, too.
Not a problem.
Kill him, your Highness.
You...
What?
I will not.
What?
You would hesitate from killing the leader of the Shadow Kin?
!
I would hesitate from killing a friend.
This is not over.
It isn't.
We've got a problem.
PHONE ALERT
- Are you OK?
- I'm not supposed to talk to you.
- You just got attacked by a shadow.
- Yeah, I know.
We have an enemy to fight.
Who's not here at the moment.
Look, we were told to keep our heads down and not cause any excitement.
- Wait a minute.
- What was that thing?
Shadow Kin, you ludicrous Care Bear.
Is this how little attention you pay in class, too?
All right, all right.
Look...
Would you believe me if I... if I said I was from another... planet?
God, yeah.
You're weird and don't know anything about pop culture.
You either alien or Amish.
I'm totally not prejudiced.
I come from a planet more beautiful than you could ever believe.
We.
We come from that planet.
It was paradise.
So, not Sheffield, then.
My people were the Rhodia.
We were a cultured, learned society.
- Can you picture it?
- Sort of.
I think I banged my head when I fell.
Well, go on.
Tell her.
He was their prince.
You were a prince?
No wonder you're strange.
I am a prince, just... without a people.
We were at war when it happened.
War against the Quill.
Our teacher here was the Quill's leading terrorist.
Freedom fighter.
The Quill lived on the smaller of the southern continents.
They mismanaged their economy and grew resentful of our success.
The Rhodia ate up all the planets resources, including those of the Quill, and then they were surprised when we objected.
We tried to help you!
By making us so dependent that we could never recover.
Hang on a minute.
Do you always look like this or were you totally all alien and had to modify your appearance to look human?
No.
Why do you ask?
It doesn't matter.
We won.
And the Rhodia have a particularly cruel punishment.
It is just.
They release a creature into your skull called an ahn.
Something about the size of two of your weirdly large human thumbs placed together.
Now imagine it with teeth and claws, digging into your brain, each claw tipped with poison.
Oh, and that's the nice bit.
It telepathically links you to a particular Rhodia, and you become their slave.
- Their servant.
- It is slavery.
It is punishment.
You can't...
If I use a weapon other than my own hands, the ahn kills me.
Yet, if I fail to protect you, I am also killed.
If I tried to remove the ahn, dead again.
- Slavery.
- Our tormentors become our protectors.
The leader of the Quill bound the future leader of the Rhodia.
What more civilised punishment could there be?
What does this have to do with the shadow people?
We were so busy fighting amongst ourselves, we never saw them coming.
They can exist as pure shadow... living unnoticed and untouchable in yours.
In this form, they can only be killed if you are.
Which is why the gun is set to shoot both ways.
They'll invade an entire world before anyone even knows they're there.
They only need to be in their solid form for the briefest of moments.
Because why would you fear your own shadow?
They killed everyone.
Everyone.
Rhodia and Quill alike.
A planet of three billion, all gone in... one day.
They killed my mother.
You two survived.
I saved you.
Run!
Agh!
Come on!
And I saved you.
How did you escape?
We were rescued.
By a figure of legend out of space and time itself.
Whatever.
Arrangements were made.
We were told to try and fit in and tell people we were from Sheffield.
I don't understand how they found us.
That opening Corakinus crawled back into.
Are they coming to kill our planet?
I mean, my planet, I guess.
This isn't how they invade.
This is different.
They're clearly looking for us.
Unfinished business.
- We should leave.
- No.
They'll follow us wherever we go.
I won't spend the rest of my life on the run.
Oh, and yet you hesitate to take your revenge.
Revenge?
APRIL GASPS
April.
April.
What's happening to her?
Why are you standing there?
!
- Do something!
- I see them.
I can hear his thoughts.
He wants you.
He wants something you have.
The gun?
He's coming for tomorrow night.
I'm going to have to cancel prom.
No, no.
If they want to kill everyone, they'll just slide into our shadows and do it at home.
Great.
Die alone or die at a party.
Plus, if we're all here, it's the best chance we'll have of getting your heart back.
You said that you could hear his thoughts.
It's gone now, but for a minute...
For a minute.
Well, for a minute he could probably read yours.
They've obviously connected because of the heart.
I told you we should kill her.
No-one is killing her.
DOOR OPENS
Leave us!
We are decorating.
DOOR CLOSES
If you see anything more, you tell us immediately.
OK?
Oh, thank God you said that.
I'd have just kept it to myself.
Just be careful of your shadows at the prom tonight, OK?
What have you seen?
Could you believe all that stuff?
Aliens, and Charlie being a prince?
I don't know.
I was attacked by a shadow.
Kind of opens your mind a little bit.
You take care.
You hear?
Thanks.
Ahem... you, too.
Why don't you tell your mum the prom's being assigned as a sociology module?
You look gorgeous!
I don't, but thanks.
- April!
- People just think that nice means fragile.
That somehow if I'm allowed to see what the real world's like, then I'll break, but...
I'm tougher than they think.
I know how tough you are.
And you're not nice.
You're kind.
There's a difference.
But kind is better.
Way better.
Yeah, cos that's what people think when they want a prom date.
"Oh, I wonder who's kind?"
April, just because you have to do a lot for me...
I don't mind.
Doesn't mean I stop being your mum.
You do look gorgeous.
And that's that.
SPEAKS OWN LANGUAGE
SHOUTING CONTINUES FROM INSIDE
Hello.
Everything all right?
Oh, yeah.
My deeply religious parents are very happy I'm going to dance with a boy.
This has been in evening of love and warmth.
Great.
You are a very strange person.
She's got a driver?
Uber, Dad.
Practice in the morning.
Oh, my God!
If you tell me one more time, I might literally go insane.
Don't abuse the word literally.
It's a good word that young people squander.
What's that, Dad?
Have a good time tonight?
Well, thanks, I'm sure I will.
You're facing a very important step in your future soon.
You have no idea what I'm facing, Dad.
What?
- What are you facing?
- See you later, Dad.
- DOOR SHUTS
- Have fun.
You look amazing.
You, too.

Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Get some space between you.
Honestly!
Is that all you people think about?
Look at all of these people!
Oh, this is going to look so good for my university application.
Do you not have a date?
Is OK.
You can dance with us.
How are you feeling?
How's your... heart?
Weird, but OK.
I keep getting really short of breath, but I'm adjusting to it.
It's amazing what the body can get used to.
I do not understand these signs.
Come on, let's dance.
For tonight, we might die.
Are you all right?
OK, seriously, what is wrong with you?
Hey, Ram!
Looking good, man.

Yes, there was a huge attack I'm keeping secret from you.
I should've put a creature in your head to make you nicer.
- Yeah, should've, but didn't.
- Hmm.
If there is any trouble, the gun is set for you.
Something is happening to your friend.

Is she epileptic?
Do we need to call an ambulance?

Is that a bad thing?

The Prince of Rhodia and his little pet.
Kill him.
Kill him!
HEARTBEATS THUD
- Ha-ha, you know why I'm here, Prince.
- You can't have it.
Then we'll just have to cover this planet in shadow, too.
No, you won't.
You won't kill me because you'll die yourself.
There is enough time of possibilities other than death.
Argh!
April!
No!
They've locked us in.
We're trapped!
Stop it.
You've got what you wanted.
Just go!
I've not yet got what I wanted.
HE GROWLS
Well, nothing left to do, then, is there, but to die well.
HE GROWLS
You know, I never thought that was possible.
Dying well.
Who wants to die well?
Surely, the aim should be NOT dying well?
You.
- You.
- Who?
- Who?
- Who?
Oh, this is a bit of a mess, isn't it?
I used to be the caretaker here, you know?
Before it got all fancy.
This is going to be quite a clean-up job.
You've heard of me, haven't you?
You are the great destruction of the universe.
Yes, but most people just call me the Doctor.
There was something I wanted to ask you...
Oh, yes!
What exactly do you think you're doing here?
We might ask you the same question.
Fair enough.
It's just that I seem to have a soft spot for people who are the last of their species, which you have made my friends here.
I found them a home, but they were supposed to live quietly.
Plus... they called.
We've got a problem.
This is not your normal modus operandi.
You invade in secret.
And you kill all at once.
You don't just pour in like any old boring army!
Bit inelegant for the Shadow Kin, isn't it?
We are here... for the Cabinet.
Oh, the Cabinet!
Oh, that's easy.
There's this painfully strange shop here called Ikea...
The Cabinet of Souls.
What's the Cabinet of Souls?
It's the centre of Rhodian religion.
The soul of every Rhodian who dies is supposed to go there.
It's a repository for a future paradise.
And a weapon.
Yes.
That, too.
It's the power of all that life crammed down into single specks of light.
It could be enough to destroy an entire species.
- He can use it against us.
- Yes.
- Yes, and who would blame him?
- I would.
Why avenge genocide with genocide?
Why avenge?
Trust me...
It doesn't matter.
The Cabinet is empty.
I knew it would be.
Every Rhodian does.
It's just bedtime stories for children to make death less scary.
As if death should be anything but terrifying.
Then why would you take it?
I kept it in memory of my people.
All my people who are gone!
Yes.
That is a crime that has not yet been answered for.
And who will make me?
You are powerful... but we are a legion.
SHE GRUNTS
You leave... or I'll make you leave.
What's going on here?
SCREWDRIVER TRILLS
You have been very busy here, haven't you?
- One heart.
Two people.
- It's why you can't kill me.
But I can.
You leave...
- or you die.
- CHARLIE:
April, no.
If you came for me, take me.
Leave these people alone.
Weren't any of you listening when I talked about not dying well?
- No-one else is dying here today.
- We disagree.
Tell me, Corakinus...
Yes, I know who you are.
You have one weakness.
It's why you skulk.
Even in your most solid form, you cannot exist when there are no...
TANYA:

- You thought correctly.
You just need a boost to the voltage!
SCREWDRIVER TRILLS

You have not seen the last of us.
Yeah, I get that a lot.
No, he still has April's heart!
Oh, for God's sake!
I don't care how you do it, but save her heart.
Sacrifice yourself if you must!
- I have no choice but to obey, Master.
- Don't call me that!
SHE YELLS
I shall take my heart with me.
Do something with your laser pointer!
It's a screwdriver.
- WHIRRING
- What will you do, Doctor?
Kill us both or let us both live?
Those are your choices.
April!

Will he live?
Yes, yes, he will.
But the more interesting question is, what are we going to do with you lot?
That opening the Shadow Kin came through,
- you couldn't close it all the way.
- Well, obviously, there's been so much artron energy around good old Coal Hill that time itself has worn thin.
I bet they didn't take that into account when they renovated.
And it can only be patched up so well.
Even by me.
So, those things will come back?
Well, they'll have to find you first.
I scrambled the pulsation.
Of course, Cole Hill will continue to act like a beacon across all of space-time, to any being who might want to make mischief with it.
So, you will have to be on your guard.
What?
No, no, no.
I thought you were going to get us out of here?
Why would you be safer somewhere else?
Time has looked at your faces.
And time... time... never forgets.
OK, Doctor.
Hey, hey, listen.
Um...
All right, these people...
Yes, they may disgust me, but at the end of the day, they're just children.
- They can't cope with this.
- I think that they have shown some rather extraordinary spirit, don't you?
A willingness to sacrifice themselves to save others.
Resourcefulness.
- Bravery.
- DOOR OPENS
And, oh, yes...
An absolute understanding of how precious life is.
- You got your leg back?
- I had some spares in the medical bay.
The Lothan, giant centipedes, experts in prosthetic legs.
You'll get the hang of it.
You just have to train it to act like your own leg.

What about football?
Unbelievably boring sport.
Now, darts...
Darts is something worth practising for.

You can't seriously expect these juveniles to deal with whatever is going to come through these tears in space and time?
- Through the what?
- It's like the Hellmouth.
- Or that town in Once Upon A Time.
- Or The Vampire Diaries.
- You watch Vampire Diaries?
- Everyone is very attractive.
Yes, it's true.
SHE GROANS
Well, they won't be on their own.
Oh, no...
No, no, please...
It is bad enough that I am a slave to that... prince.
You have committed a crime and you will be punished.
No, I was a freedom fighter for my people.
- We were oppressed by...
- You know what I'm talking about.
- Oh...
- Hm...
I can't be everywhere.
So!
You will help these amazing humans here... and these amazing humans will help you.
How?
I can't fire weapons!
I can't use swords and knives and screwdrivers!
Your brain, Miss Quill.
Best weapon there is.
Look at you!
What an amazing team!
You'll be able to handle anything that time throws at you.
Oh, come on!
Cheer up!
It's not that hard.
It's no harder than all these exams that you have to take these days.
Except for Media Studies.
It's going to be harder than that.

How does the rage not consume your life at every waking moment?
How do you know it doesn't?
A prince can't simply run around being furious.

Sorry I'm late.
I was fielding the latest round of complaints.
Complaints?
- About what?
- You.
Me?
What have I done?
Exactly what I hired you to do.
You've been helping my people navigate a legal system built to disenfranchise them.
That is what you've been doing, isn't it?
I've been trying.
I've been going through Mathias' old cases and reaching out to people on the Res...
Putting up fliers.
Yeah, I-I thought that would be...
Cady Longmire.
Free Legal Aid.
Funded by Four Arrows Casino.
For a lot of my people, the most frightening words they can hear are,
"I'm a concerned white person, and I'm here to help."
You just put a bull's-eye on yourself.
And it doesn't help that the first tribal casino checks went out this week.
Isn't that a good thing?
Yeah, but it's not a life-changing thing, and that's what people were expecting.
- So when they see your fliers...
- They wonder if I'm the reason
- their checks aren't any bigger.
- Oh, yeah.
Then maybe we need to show the tribe that the money you're investing in me is actually for them.
And how do we do that?
With something visible.
I could start by opening up an office on the Reservation, paying rent, utilities.
Yeah, interesting... something visible.
Just keep in mind, people on the Res may not see the world the same way you do.
[slot machines dinging] [tense music playing]
Hi, are you okay?
Can I open the door?
Hi.
My name's Cady.
What's your name?
Olivia.
Olivia.
Okay.
I'm waiting for my dad.
How long have you been out here?
I don't know.
[slot machines dinging] [indistinct conversations]
[Jacob] Oh, it's perfectly okay.
I'm...
I'm kind of glad you did.
Sometimes it's better just
- to keep things in-house like this.
- Yeah, I know I...
I should have called the tribal police, but she lives in the county,
- and I...
It's habit.
- If he were my dad, I think I'd...
- think I might do the same thing.
- He's here.
Hey.
Thank you so much for coming.
We...
It was nice to hear from you.
It's been a couple weeks, so...
- Yeah, I've...
I've been busy...
- Where is she?
Um... oh, she's over there.
Any sign of her father?
We're still searching the premises.
Her name's Olivia Parr.
She's ten years old.
Her father, Vincent, told her to wait in the car while he came in here.
Don't worry, honey.
Mr. Malachi has old-man's eyes.
But I bet Miss Cady will have better luck finding your Pop.
And maybe a sody pop, too.
- [chuckles]
- Come on, Olivia.
Come with me.
Ah, there's no sign of the deadbeat anywhere.
Poor girl's putting on a brave face, but she's terrified.
Do you know what time her father came in here?
The girl thinks she was waiting in the car for a couple of hours, but, uh... she's a ten-year-old kid, so it's hard to tell.
We thought maybe you could take her home.
[man] Mr. Nighthorse?
Excuse me.
Dad's probably holed up in one of the hotel rooms with a little, uh, side action, huh?
What kind of sleazeball would bring his daughter to a joint like this?
[slot machines dinging]
So, which house is yours?
That one.
Okay.
Now, I'm gonna walk you in, and I'm sure your mom's gonna have some questions.
She's probably sleeping, but okay.

Whose car is that?
[Olivia] Mom's.
Why don't you just wait here for a moment, okay?
[engine running] [suspenseful music playing]
Mom!
Mom, wake up!
I got her.
Come on.
Get the door!
[Olivia] It's okay.
Mom gets like this sometimes.
Let's get her in the shower.
Bathroom's down the hall.
[Walt] Does this happen a lot?
[Olivia] Just give us a few minutes.
She'll be fine.
This way?
Yeah.
[grunts]
Maybe you could go make her some coffee?
All right.
Thank you.
[water running]
[dramatic music playing]
[Olivia] Help!
I need help!
I can't hold her up.
I'm sorry.
[Melissa] The sleeping pills must've hit me harder than I thought.
Why were you in your car?
I got worried when Vincent and Olivia didn't come home last night.
I tried calling a bunch of times, but no one answered.
And then...
After that, it gets a little fuzzy.
Anything you can remember helps.
Uh...
I remember going to the garage.
After that, just cold water.
Mom, I have a book report due.
Okay if I work on it?
Well, it's 4:00 in the morning.
Maybe you should get some rest.
But I'll get a bad grade if I don't turn it in on time.
Oh, well, go ahead, honey.
And if Dad doesn't get home soon, I'll give you a ride to school.
[rock music playing over stereo]
Missing a kitten?
No.
I'm looking for office space.
Jacob Nighthorse hired me to open a legal-aid center.
You are working for Jacob?
Does Walt know about this?
He does.
And he also knows that I am a grown adult, fully capable of making my own decisions.
Did you tell him, or did he figure it out?
No, I told him.
Mm.
I didn't tell him everything.
What did you leave out?
How much money Jacob gave me.
How much did he give you?
750,000.
Dollars?
Yes.
That is generous.
- You're upset.
- I am surprised.
Yeah, well, apparently you're not the only one.
There's already been complaints.
Jacob made a lot of promises to the tribe.
How much were these tribal casino checks?
About $745,000 less than yours.
Oh. [scoffs]
Henry, do you have any idea where I can find some office space on the Res?
So I can start putting this money back into the community?
There is not much in the way of traditional office space.
You may have to be non-traditional in your thinking.
[school bell rings] [indistinct conversations]
[Walt] Olivia can't make it to school today, but she wanted me to turn in her book report.
Olivia... she's so conscientious.
But why are you dropping it off?
Well, I wanted to ask you a few questions about Olivia's father.
Ah, Vincent.
He's one of the good ones.
Attentive, reliable, active in the school.
But that's no surprise...
he's the guidance counselor over at the high school.
They're lucky to have him.
Well, Vincent Parr has gone missing.
He was last seen going into the Four Arrows Casino last night.
The casino?
That doesn't sound like him.
Unless...
Unless what?
It's unprofessional to gossip
- about a student's home life.
- Well, it's not unprofessional to help locate a student's missing parent.
[sighs] It's possible that Olivia's mother got herself into trouble, and Vincent needed money to bail her out.
What kind of trouble?
I can't prove anything, but when I do see her, which is rare, she's real jittery.
Jittery...
like drugs?
If word got out that I was saying something like that about a parent of one of my students, I could lose my job.
Okay.
If something has happened to Vincent, do you think Olivia would be safe in her mother's care?
I really can't give you an honest answer on that.
[door opens]
Did you find Vincent?
No luck so far, but Deputy Ferguson is still at the casino searching, so...
Should I be worried?
Well, that casino's pretty big.
It's gonna take a while to cover the whole place, um...
Do you know why your husband was at the casino last night?
[scoffs] No.
The last I knew, he and Olivia were driving back from getting gas.
Is that true?
No.
We were at the gas station earlier.
We had just arrived at the casino when Dad called Mom.
Why'd your dad fib to your mom?
Dad said the casino was our secret.
He said it was okay since he'd won so much money the night before.
The night before?
How much money did he win?
I don't know.
Olivia, do you mind giving me a few minutes alone with your mother?
Ms. Safford gave me your worksheets for today.
Now, I know Ruby would be happy to help you if you need it.
Okay.
Um...
I'm sorry if this is a little direct, but does Vincent have a gambling problem?
No, I don't think so.
You didn't know he was at the casino either night?
No, I didn't.
Does your family have financial problems right now?
No, Vincent's job at the high school is the best job he's ever had.
So, if you didn't know he was at the casino, where'd you think he was?
I didn't think about it, really.
Well, Vincent usually picks up Olivia after school and then takes her to her math tutor or piano practice.
After that, sometimes they pick up dinner or groceries, then they head home.
What time do they usually come home?
I don't know.
Why not?
I'm not always awake when they get home.
[knock on door]
Yeah?
Walt, can I talk to you?
Yeah.
Excuse me.
[Ruby] Ferg just called.
A body turned up, middle-aged male.
And it fits Vincent Parr's description.
Okay.
I'll take a ride out to the casino.
No, he's not at the casino.
Ferg said the body is on the other side of the county, 20 miles away.
[dramatic music plays]
What's the bus doing here?
One of the kids found the body when they were walking from that trailer park over there to the bus stop.
Driver felt conflicted about leaving a dead body.
How'd he feel about exposing a bus full of kids to emotional trauma?
Well, I covered the body up, but I don't think we need to worry about these kids being traumatized.
[Walt] Tell the driver he can leave.
Tell those kids to erase those pictures from their phones.
[engine starts]
[Vic] Is that the father?
Looks like him.
If he was last seen at the casino, what's he doing all the way out here?
I don't know.
You find out anything else at the casino?
Not really.
Malachi couldn't locate any footage of Vincent Parr.
Isn't that sort of what you expect Malachi to say, though, if he and his goons are still ripping off the big winners?
You know, Olivia said that her father won big.
There's no money in his wallet.
[Walt] He's got these marks across his stomach and his chest.
Looks like he was run over.
Anything else in his pockets?
There's no keys.
Just a broken phone and, uh, this.
[suspenseful music playing]
Ferg, let's get Vincent Parr's body to the hospital.
If the kid who found the body was coming over from the trailer park,
I'm gonna go over there and ask some questions,
- see if anybody saw anything.
- And if they didn't, maybe someone saw something at the casino.
[Malachi] Well, see, that's the downside of running 150 state-of-the-art security cameras 24/7.
There's lots and lots of movies.
- I'm still looking through them all.
- Right.
Always happy to cooperate with an investigation, Sheriff.
Which is now a murder investigation.
Vincent Parr's body was found in my county.
According to the victim's daughter, he came here the last two nights, and he was winning.
And I find it surprising that you have no record of this.
Surprising, is it?
So, what are you thinking?
You think, uh, we're covering something up?
Maybe it's just due to negligence on the part of your security team, Jacob.
Malachi, please keep reviewing the video, every single thing from the last 48 hours.
[Walt] Vincent Parr had his wallet.
None of his winnings were in it.
Malachi's loan-sharking and mugging scheme may have just escalated.
Okay, you have no proof of this "scheme."
I won't, either, as long as Malachi's the one in charge of investigating himself.
You have any other theories right now, aside from these insane levels of corruption in my organization?
I do.
Something happened in room 503 of your hotel.
[Vic] Hello?
[knock on door]
Anyone there?
[Joe] Hey, there.
Everyone's welcome at the Chrysalis Mobile Home Villa, where caterpillars blossom into butterflies.
If you're looking for a new house, I got three cozy units available.
I'll take that under consideration.
Are you the manager?
- Yes, ma'am.
Folks call me Joe-Mega, because I used to be a mega partier, but now I'm just mega-blessed.
Okay, Mr. Mega, did you happen to see anything unusual last night?
No, why?
Well, this man was found dead practically in your backyard.
And he was driving this car.
I don't know that car, and this man's not dead.
He's not?
Death isn't death.
It's just another stage of life.
An eternal chrysalis.
I'll let the victim know.
I'm sure he'll be delighted.
In the meantime, if you or any of your butterflies remember anything, go ahead and, uh, give us a call.
Yes, ma'am.
Okay.
Caitlyn, who was staying in room 503 the last two nights?
It appears 503 is being held for ten days by a corporate account, a company called Manifest Destinations.
Anyone use the room last night or the night before?
No, doesn't look like it.
Thank you.
We shut down Malachi's last loan-sharking office in the casino men's bathroom.
Maybe he's upgraded to a hotel suite.
Or maybe... you know, just maybe...
the numbers five zero three refer to something other than a room in my hotel.
Why don't you let me know what you and Malachi find on those security tapes.
Yeah.
[dramatic music playing]
Caitlyn, how often has Manifest Destinations booked rooms with us?
Quite often, actually.
Huh.
Print me out a record, please, and, uh, notify me of any further reservations.
And you know what?
Let's just keep this between you and me, okay?
Hey, sir?
- Do you travel this road a lot?
- Oh, yes, ma'am.
Me and Tito here, we scoot just about everywhere.
See anything unusual last night?
It's about that crazy lady, right?
[clears throat]
Yeah.
Where'd you see her?
Oh, right back there.
We were riding out for a late-night milkshake.
And she pulled right up to us.
Said she was looking for a car.
What kind of car?
Blue... royal blue. [chuckles]
And, uh, what did she look like?
We didn't really get a good look, did we?
I-It was dark, and the poor thing, she... she just seemed afraid to show herself.
Paws over her face and everything.
She... she was super-shaky.
Goofed out on something, probably.
When we asked what was wrong, she just freaked out, sped off.
Huh.
And, uh...
What was she driving?
Oh, one of those little S.U.V.s...
a Honda.
And it had one of those cutesy-pie mom, dad, and kid stick-figure sticker on the back window.
I found the girl's mom passed out in a Honda with the same sticker on it.
So, what?
You think the mom did it?
[Walt] I don't know.
Okay.
You want me to call child services about the little girl?
I mean, technically, we're supposed to, right?
Technically, but there's something I have to do first.
[dramatic music playing]
[knock on door]
We found Vincent.
You found my dad?
We're still trying to figure out what happened.
Unfortunately, he... your father was injured very badly, and... he didn't survive.
Mom.
I'm very sorry.
Mom, Dad's dead!
[crying]
Mom!
[whimpering]
[engine shuts off]
You didn't have to come all the way out here, you know.
I would've found the place...
eventually.
Finding the place was not my concern.
Your safety was.
You love me like a father, don't you?
Yes, I do.
You're also underestimating me like a father.
Henry, I can't use this as an office.
This is someone's home.
It was foreclosed last month.
[sighs]
There any other options?
Yes.
Other foreclosed homes in worse condition than this.
[cell phone ringing]
This is Henry.
[Nighthorse] Ah, so your phone does work.
I was beginning to wonder why I haven't heard from you.
I have been somewhat busy lately.
Is that right?
You find a better way to get your bar back than by helping me?
I have not.
[Jacob] I didn't think so.
Which means we need to have a talk about what exactly Malachi is up to.
[dramatic music plays]
[sniffles] [breathes deeply]
[clears throat]
[breathing deeply]
Hi, Donna.
It's me, Walt...
Longmire.
Um, I guess I left a message or two already.
Um, this is work-related.
Um, I got a young girl whose father was found dead.
She's here with her mother.
She's a little unstable.
I'd like to put off calling social services as long as I can.
So, I could use some professional guidance.
You could call me back here or, uh, just call Ruby, if that's easier.
Okay.
[sighs]
[indistinct conversations]
[cell phone ringing, vibrating]
Damn.
- Hey, Ruby.
- [Walt] Any word from the coroner yet?
Oh, hey, Sheriff.
Yeah.
Vincent Parr was crushed to death, just as we thought.
Someone ran him over in the last eight to 18 hours.
You know, I'm...
I'm happy to wait here.
You know, just wait for the results and the blood work.
No, that could take hours.
I need you to get over to the Parr house.
Take a look underneath the wife's car.
You think the wife ran him over?
Well, if she did, there'd be damage to the undercarriage.
On it.
Can Olivia and I go now?
Soon.
We still need your help in our investigation, um, answering some background questions.
Okay.
[Walt] When we found you in your car last night, um, you remembered getting into it but nothing after that?
Yeah, that's right.
It's...
all a blank.
[Walt] Is it possible that you drove out to look for your husband and daughter?
I don...
I don't know.
- Did I?
- Apparently, you stopped to talk to a man while driving out near where Vincent's body was found.
[Melissa] I don't remember that at all.
What did I say to him?
You asked him if he'd seen Vincent's royal blue sedan.
[Melissa] Really?
Well, I...
I guess if he saw me...
I mean, I...
I was really...
really worried about them.
If you were worried about your husband and daughter, why didn't you just call us?
Well, some... sometimes when I get all worked up about things, um, and I think something's happened, like, a part of me knows it might... might just all be in my head.
I had... had an accident a few years ago that kind of changed things for me.
- You have some kind of head injury?
- No, nothing like that.
I'm just kind of in a lot of pain, and, um, that can kind of c...
cloud my mind.
Yeah.
[sighs]
What do you think?
I think Melissa Parr's addicted to painkillers.
Yeah.
That can be a pretty expensive habit to feed.
- Yeah.
- Maybe that's her motive.
She kills Vincent for his casino winnings.
She seems really nervous around me.
- That could just be the pills.
- Maybe.
Maybe if I wasn't around, she'd open up more to you.
It's worth a try.
Yeah.
Why not order a burger from your own restaurant?
And miss out on the best burger in town?
Why would I do that?
So, have you found out anything about
Malachi laundering money through the Red Pony?
I am just delivering food.
I do not know what you are talking about.
You think my office is bugged and that Malachi is listening in.
Malachi, if you are listening, Standing Bear and I are conspiring as we speak to uncover all your criminal activities.
You got that?
If we're gonna work together, Henry, we have to at least pretend to trust each other.
Fine.
All I know is that there is a lot more money flowing through the Red Pony... new revenue streams, too.
According to the ledger I found, your casino is booking my catering services several times a week.
- Okay, that's news to me.
- Me too.
So, there must be a second ledger with the real numbers and the real sources of income.
- I have not found it yet.
- Try harder.
And when you find it, keep an eye out for a company called Manifest Destinations.
I think they're a front for a criminal organization.
- Already?
The casino just opened.
- Oh, yeah.
Everyone's trying to siphon away the profits.
Ah, yes.
The profits that should be going to the tribe.
Is this about Cady?
It has less to do with Cady than about your priorities.
My priorities are the well-being of our people and the infrastructure of our community.
Schools, community centers, access to legal aid.
And the people themselves?
Have you heard of "refeeding syndrome"?
It's when a starved body can't process an excess of new food.
The body shuts down... dies, even.
For centuries, our people have been starved of prosperity and opportunity.
You can't just open up a buffet and expect a starving person to make smart choices.
You have to feed the starved body a little at a time so that it can get well again.
So, you are saving misguided Indians from themselves.
You sound like the U.S. government.
You find anything under her vehicle?
I'll show you.
Here.
No marks, no mess.
Nothing at all?
No blood?
Nope, it's clean.
Maybe I should look under some other cars.
I'm thinking Malachi's and Darius's.
Thanks.
[Vic] Hey, Walt!
Yeah.
You got a call.
Donna call back?
No.
[rock music playing over stereo]
♪ Come on, give me what you got ♪
♪ I'll even give you the first shot ♪
Little Big Man.
Written, directed, and starring whitey.
In terms of white man ass-kissing, I'd give it four stars.
Is that why you called...
to give me a movie review?
No, but I do have some film for you to watch.
So, uh, grab some popcorn.
I got some footage of your guy two nights ago.
And, yes, he was winning big.
And he was not alone.
Was his wife there?
[Malachi] I don't know.
Does his wife look like that?
[Walt] No.
Who is she?
[Malachi] No idea.
But I do know that Jacob didn't want me to show you any of this.
Why are you showing me this?
[Malachi] Because, uh...
I have a granddaughter, same age as his daughter.
I don't get to see her very much, but, uh...
I'd do anything for that little girl.
We found a napkin like the one in that video with 503 written on it.
- I need to see inside that room.
- [chuckles]
Walter, I-I can't exactly waltz you through my boss's palace and escort you.
But I can tell you that, uh, my guys take their lunch break in about 40 minutes from now.
You gonna go check out that hotel room?
Mm-hmm.
Uh-huh.
Yeah, no, nothing new here.
I'll keep an eye on them.
- Is everything okay?
- I...
I must've caught a bug.
I should go home.
All right, um, stay here, and I'll get you some tea.
- I need to go home.
- It's okay, Mom.
Listen, we're gonna get you guys out of here as soon as we can, but we still haven't talked about who might have had a problem with Vincent, okay?
- All right.
- Hey.
- Hi.
- I got Walt's message.
You just missed him.
Oh.
Um, maybe you and I could speak in Walt's office for a second.
Sure.
Uh, that woman is not okay.
Clearly...
she's going through withdrawal.
She was doped up when Walt brought her in this morning.
So then you called Child Protective Services.
So, when do they get here?
- We haven't called them yet.
- That woman is in no condition to take care of her daughter, and Walt's message said that the dad had been killed, so...
I mean, what are we waiting for here, huh?
The child to suffer irreversible trauma?
The mother's a suspect in the father's death.
Yes, all the more reason to call.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
[clears throat]
If we can observe and talk to her for a little while longer, we may be able to figure out how and why the father was killed.
In fact, Walt just left to give them a chance to open up.
You know, he knows that some people wait for him to leave to start talking.
Okay, look, why don't you just stop with the subtle insinuations?
You're... you're actually not very good at it, especially not the subtle part.
Okay.
I find it rather coincidental that you show up just minutes after Walt leaves.
What, were you waiting outside for him to go so you could barely miss him like you've been missing his phone calls?
All right, well, you know...
[clears throat]
Walt hired you, so he trusts you.
So, he must see qualities in you that aren't obvious to the naked eye.
So, I will give you the benefit of the doubt and give you an answer.
You see, I missed a little bit of work recently.
It's a long story...
you know, kidnapping, gunshot wound.
And so I have been working overtime to make it up.
Does that work for you?
Hmm?
Or do you have some follow-up questions concerning your boss's private life?
[Vic] Thanks... you know, for coming down to my level and granting me a response.
But while we're on the topic of not understanding what Walt sees in other people, let me be unsubtle.
[scoffs]
I have no idea what makes you worthy of him.
I really don't.
But I saw him go through hell when your life was in danger.
And so when he reaches out to contact you, he deserves a response.
He deserves more than that, of course, but he sure as hell doesn't deserve less.
Not from you.
Not from anyone.
- [Olivia] Mom, no!
- [Melissa] We've got to get out of here!
- [Ruby] You can't leave!
- No!
- I don't know what happened!
- Okay, calm down.
- No, no.
I need to get home.
- Calm down, okay?
You're in a safe place.
- I know.
- I'm very sick.
I need my medicine.
All right, I cannot release your daughter into your custody
- when you are in this state, all right?
- Okay, fine, I'll just leave her here,
- but I need to go home.
- You do not have a car.
- Okay, then I'll call a cab!
[panting]
- I got this.
Please put the phone down, all right?
Don't look at me like that.
Don't look at me like I'm a bad mom.
You know, I wouldn't say that.
That's not what I said, okay?
You're not a bad mom.
Oh, God!
Shit!
- [gasps]
- Okay.
- I'm sorry.
- No, okay.
- Okay.
All right.
- I'm so sorry.
Nope, nope.
It's fine.
- All right, okay.
- No!
Please don't touch me!
No!
Aah!
Aah!
Okay.
I'm sorry.
I was told that this room was unoccupied.
Can I help you?
Well, I'm Sheriff Longmire.
Do you mind if I ask you a few questions, Miss...
Missus, actually.
It's Mrs. Shawna Crawford.
No, come on in.
Thank you.
I have to go to work in a few minutes,
- so I don't have long to talk.
- What kind of work?
I'm a travel agent for a company called
Manifest Destinations, out of Massachusetts.
I'm here touring the hotel, putting travel packages together and such.
So, what do you need?
Do you know this man?
Are you sure you're the sheriff and not some P.I. my husband hired?
Pretty certain, yeah.
Yeah, I recognize him.
I saw him gambling a few nights ago.
He looked... safe.
And I was a bit lonely and a bit tipsy, to be honest.
So, we flirted a little bit.
I even wrote down my room number, but I guess he wasn't interested.
And that was the last I saw of him.
- I actually never even got his name.
- What night was this?
It was two nights ago.
Did you see him last night?
No, just the one night.
Why?
Well, he was found dead in my county this morning.
He's dead?
I'm trying to piece together his last few days.
Is there anything you could, uh, tell me about your conversation?
Um, wow.
Uh, okay.
Our conversation, um...
Uh, well, he complimented me on my vocabulary, which was a nice surprise.
Um, and he said he was on a lucky streak so he couldn't leave the table.
And I remember thinking that if he did come to my room,
I was setting myself up for disappointment.
How so?
The more I talked to him, I realized he was wasted.
- Vincent was drunk?
- He masked it well.
He wasn't slurring his words or anything.
But his eyes and breath gave it away.
[telephone ringing]
You expecting a call?
No.
Well, you're getting one.
Yeah.
[ringing continues]
Hello?
This is Shawna Crawford.
Yes, this is room 503.
It's for you.
I'm at the hospital with Melissa Parr.
[Walt] What happened?
I think we might have just found another motive.
[indistinct P.A. announcement]
Yeah, okay.
Hey, I, uh...
I got your message, and you're absolutely right.
Suspect or not, that girl's mother is in no shape to take care of a child.
So if... if there isn't any other available family, she's gonna have to be placed with a social worker.
- Thanks.
- Yeah, um...
I...
I got your other messages, too.
Yeah, uh...
So, should I just mail your blouse and other clothes to you?
[Donna] No, no, I'll pick them up.
Um...
Look, Walt, I know that we need to talk, but you're... you're busy now, so we'll just talk later.
Okay.
- Okay.
- All right.
Melissa Parr is in an exam room.
- Where's Olivia?
- Ferg's keeping her distracted.
We also got Vincent Parr's blood tests back.
Vincent was drunk when he died.
Twice the legal limit.
How did you know?
Room 503.
So what's behind this door?
What happened?
I couldn't hide the truth anymore.
The truth about what?
Vincent.
It's okay.
[dramatic music playing]
This is the fourth robbery in six months by a bank robber authorities have taken to calling Cowboy Bill.
Witnesses describe this Cowboy Bill as being a polite man...
Do you have any jacks?
Uh...
Go fish.
[reporter] ...pulling in $20,000.
Hey, I'll be right back.
No peeking.
And keep your eye out for Cowboy Bill for me, all right?
Walt wants me to take Olivia.
Where?
Somewhere Children's Services is less likely to show up.
The first time Vincent hit me was four years ago.
I came here asking for painkillers.
I...
I told the doctor I'd been in a bicycle accident.
What really happened?
Well, we had gone to a holiday party for the high school staff.
I drank too much wine.
And I bumped into the vice principal, and I caused her to spill something.
It's not that huge of a deal.
Right?
When we got home, Vincent... completely lost it.
And I ended up with a broken collarbone.
Had he ever hit you before?
No, he changed after he got that job.
- Why?
- I think it was because of his father.
When Vincent was growing up, his dad drank himself right out of a job and their family... right out of their house.
So, Vincent was not gonna let that happen.
So, no matter how much he drank, he always wanted to, you know, have the appearance of an upstanding family man and a good provider.
And he would just lose it when he thought I was jeopardizing that.
Did Vincent hit Olivia, as well?
[Melissa] No.
No, if he ever would've laid a hand on our baby girl,
I would have gotten her out of there.
I would've done the right thing.
Is that why you went out driving last night?
To do the right thing?
When Vincent and Olivia didn't come home, I got scared.
I knew Vincent was lying about where he was.
You knew he was at the casino?
I knew he'd been drinking, 'cause I could hear it in his voice.
Probably the Rusty Lantern.
Did Vincent often take your ten-year-old with him when he'd go drinking?
He said leaving her in the car was safer than leaving her with me because...
I was an unfit mother.
But when he called drunk and then they didn't come home...
I didn't care.
I knew I shouldn't be driving, but...
All I could think about was Olivia in some wreck.
It's been a nightmare.
Did you run your husband over to end that nightmare?
[breathes deeply]
I don't know what I did last night.
[knock on door]
Come in.
Did we have a meeting scheduled?
N-No, no.
I was just coming to tell you that I found some decent office space on the Res.
I mean, it's gonna need a lot of work before it can open, but...
I have a good handyman for you.
A gentleman named Sam Poteet.
Actually, I can take care of the repairs myself.
But it was your idea to visibly demonstrate how the money's being reinvested on the Res.
Don't you think hiring a member of the tribe will help with that?
Not if it's a waste of money.
Mr. Poteet... is both highly dependable... and highly efficient.
Are you threatening me?
In Cheyenne culture, the most prized dowry a groom can offer his new bride's father is a rifle.
There's a reason for this tradition.
Do you know what it is?
No, clearly.
The idea is that you never arm your enemy.
You're making a deep and, dare I say, courageous commitment to this tribe.
The rifle is a symbol of my trust.
Take it.
Thank you.
And for those times when symbols don't suffice... you should have these, as well.
[horn honks]
[Vic] Hey.
Bartender confirms that Vincent was in here for about an hour last night.
He had four beers and four shots.
Eight drinks in an hour?
Jesus.
Cashier at the minimart said that Olivia did come in there.
She got a sandwich and some Skittles, and she crossed back over and got into a royal blue sedan.
Right.
[Vic] So, Vincent Parr leaves the Rusty Lantern around 9:00 p.m.
It's a 30-minute drive from there to the casino, and he's seen entering the casino around 9:30, leaving Olivia in the car.
Then he isn't seen again until the kid finds him here, 20 miles from the casino.
So, if Melissa killed Vincent, how'd she get his body from the casino all the way out there?
She said she didn't even know that he was at the casino.
So, she's lying or just confused.
Let's take Malachi at his word that Vincent Parr never made it inside the casino last night.
[sighs]
So, that would mean whatever happened, happened out here.
From here, you can see everything.
Is this where Olivia was sitting when Cady found her?
It is.
So, then if Melissa picked up Vincent, or Malachi's guys mugged him...
His daughter saw it.
I need to go talk to Olivia.
[sighs]
Probably should get Vincent's car back to the family.
Do you have the keys?
I can drive it over there.
I think we need to call a tow truck.
Thanks, Ferg.
How are you feeling?
Terrible.
But they gave me some Pedialyte, which is helping.
Where's Olivia?
She's here.
She's in good hands.
I'm afraid to even ask this, but... but what did you find out about last night?
Whatever happened to Vincent,
I think your daughter saw it and she's afraid to talk.
Because she saw me?
I don't know yet.
Dad picked me up from school, and we went to get dinner.
Where?
[Olivia] The gas station.
I got a sandwich and some Skittles.
I ate in the car.
Outside the bar?
Yeah.
I waited while Dad went inside.
Then we drove to the casino.
What happened when you got to the casino?
Dad went inside, like I said.
And that's the truth?
Olivia, darling, you need to tell the sheriff the truth.
Even if it puts me in a bad light, you need to tell him what happened, no matter what I did.
The sheriff already knows that Dad hit me.
When your dad went into the casino last night, did anybody stop him?
I got some photos.
Was it this man?
No?
How about this one?
From the other night.
Okay.
Olivia, um, did you see your mother outside the casino last night?
It's okay.
We're gonna tell the truth now, no matter what.
No more secrets.
No.
Mom wasn't at the casino last night.
Okay.
So who did you see with your dad?
You didn't see anybody, did you?
Because your dad was never at the casino last night.
What are you talking about?
Olivia, could you empty out your pockets for me?
[dramatic music playing]
Everything, please.
[dramatic music playing]
I found these on the driver's side floor.
I never found your dad's car keys.
That's because he gave them to you, isn't it?
You were your dad's designated driver.
No, but O-Olivia can't drive.
She's ten.
Dad taught me.
So he wouldn't get a DUI and lose his job.
But if you drove him to the casino, how'd they find his body out by the bar?
Because Olivia...
didn't drive Vincent to the casino.
He was never there last night.
There's no footage of him on the inside.
And if he'd been stopped outside by you or anyone, somebody would've seen it.
Olivia, what happened to your dad on the drive between the bar and the casino?
One of my dreams happened.
What?
I used to dream about somebody coming to rescue us.
So that you could go to the doctor and get better.
I dreamed up all the ways that Dad could disappear.
And one of your dreams turned real last night?
[Olivia] When I was driving from the bar, Dad called Mom to say we were coming home.
Then he fell asleep with his head against the door.
It was dark.
There wasn't anyone else on the road.
So I pulled the car over, put the handle in "P"
like Dad showed me, and I came around and opened his door.
Dad fell out without waking up.
So I closed the door, got back inside.
Then I put the handle in "R".
And the car went backward over him.
Then I put it in "D"... and drove to the casino and waited for someone to see me.
[Melissa crying]
Mom.
Don't be sad.
Dad's gone now.
You can go to the doctor and get better.
[sobbing lightly]
[Olivia] It's all gonna be okay.
[crying]
[knock on door]
[sighs]
Oh, good, you're, uh... you're still up.
Yeah, I was just puttering around the house.
- Come in.
- Oh, yeah.
[sighs]
Uh...
This is for you.
[Donna] Oh.
- Is it a gift?
- It's laundry.
Ah, every girl's dream.
Yeah.
Uh, I'll get you a beer.
Yeah.
So, uh...
I finally called Children's Services.
So does that mean that the mother killed the girl's father?
No, it was the girl actually, to protect the mother.
She'll be evaluated and go into counseling, um... while the mom rehabilitates, but... she won't be charged.
- She's too young.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
This world will surprise you.
Yep.
I'm pregnant.
Pregnant?
- Aren't you a little, um...
- Be really careful.
Aren't we both a little...
autumnal for that?
Well, surprise.
Yeah.
I guess we should make it official.
- And get married.
- It's the right thing to do.
There's... there's room here, plenty of space...
For God sakes, Walt, I am not pregnant.
- But you just said that you were pregnant.
- No, I know what I said.
I said it to make a point.
That you're a very convincing liar?
No, to make that point that if I were pregnant, you would be the sort of guy who would just immediately ask me to marry him, you know?
Even though... even thought that's...
that's not what you want.
I never said that.
You don't have to.
Look, I know you like me.
And I like you... a lot, actually.
But what I don't want is for you to feel obligated to be in a relationship with me because now, suddenly, after the attack, you know, it's... it's the right thing to do, okay?
I just...
I don't feel like pity and obligation are ideal foundations for a romance, so...
All right.
How about clean laundry?
And a... an enduring perplexity about existence?
[chuckles]
Well, I guess there are some romances built on worse, right?
[Walt] Yeah.
You want to sit?
Yeah.
[soft music playing] [both sigh]
Speaking of perplexity, do you actually know how a woman gets pregnant?
Well, um...
I think I may have read about that somewhere.
So, why would you think that I was, you know...
What do you mean?
Didn't we, um...?
You don't remember?
I got hit in the head.
So did we?
Well...
I guess every great romance deserves a little mystery.
[laughs] [soft music continues]
The gunman was late dropping off the car.
He missed the boat.
They're calling again.
I'm going to need the name of Robbie's partner.
See, you and me, we haven't even got started yet!
Whatever Michael Thompson was going to tell them, it was bigger than just Arthur McCall.
Level Nine...
Burn...
Please, get them talk to me.
I'll meet Freya, but, not here.
Shetland.
My work is not to everybody's taste.
That club
- Level Nine?
It was owned and run by one of McCall's men.
- Cheers!
- Who's that?
Calvin Sarwar.
Your client would like me to...?
Refocus your investigation.
I think something happened in Level Nine on Burns Night.
- This flight has been delayed.
- Is it a two-pint delay?
She definitely had a ticket.
She just didn't get on the flight.
SHETLAND

Season 3 Episode 05 of 06
Jimmy!
It's Tosh!
She just walked into a police station in Cambuslang.
She's fine, Jimmy.
She's fine, OK?
Right.
Apparently, they put a hood over her head, drove her to the edge of the city and left her to walk back without her shoes.
Other than that, she's not been hurt.
OK?
OK.
She wanted to wait on a doctor till you got here.
Right, well, then, let's get you seen to, then?
Right.
You got any preference as to AE departments?
No.
No, I mean no, not a hospital.
Sandyford.
The SARC.
He said I was a message you couldn't ignore.
How do you like to be called?
Alison?
Is Alison OK?
Do you want to talk to a police officer, Alison?
We're not the police, we're independent,
- but if you want to talk to someone...
- No.
No police.
But you would like us to gather evidence, is that right?
Would you like somebody with you while we do this, Alison?
Are you there?
Yeah, I'm here.
Have you washed since the event, Alison?
No.
Have you brushed your teeth?
No.
Did you vomit?
Yes.
After.
Are you aware of any injuries?
No.
I didn't fight.
I just did what he said.
Yeah, I know they say flight or fight, but sometimes, your body just closes down.
And there are some injuries here.
You're just not always aware at the time.
Are you sure she's all right?
I mean, if I'd been bundled intae a car and a bag stuck over my head
(and dropped outside the city without any shoes on,
I don't think I'd be straight back to work.
You're looking all right.
I AM all right.
- What about you?
- You know.
Sore.
But fine.
From the Guizer Jarl and the Jarl Squad.
We're not the only ones glad to have her home safe and sound.
OK.
So, what have we got on this Burns Night attack at Level Nine?
Maybe the reporting officer just forgot
- to put the complainant's name down?
- And their own?
No.
Someone's covering something and we're definitely looking in the right place or they wouldn't have bothered trying to warn us off.
Sandy... check the hospitals, maybe our victim needed medical attention.
And see if you can find out who the police surgeon at Gallowgate was at the time.
Billy?
Now, either that report was filed incomplete or it was tampered with after.
Whichever way it happened, we need to know who was working out of Gallowgate at the time.
- Yeah.
- Also, pull everything you can find about Level Nine - company directors, trading history, accounts, payroll - whatever you can find.
Right, Tosh?
We should go through your statement.
Do you want to do this somewhere else?
Yeah.
At the airport bar, what did you drink?
Beer.
- How many?
- Three.
- Who paid?
- Him.
Then me, then him again.
And did he pay by card or by cash?
Card.
A Visa.
And then?
They announced another delay to the flight.
He said he knew a good bar.
He said we should take a cab.
When we got outside, there was one waiting.
A black saloon.
You still can't remember the make?
After a couple of minutes,
I thought we were going the wrong way, so I turned to look out of the window.
He must've had the hood in his pocket.
Did he say anything?
Just...
words.
Names.
You know...
The names women always get called.
Do you know how far you drove?
We could've been going in circles!
I couldn't see.
Right, when you got to the place... ..inside... could you hear anything?
Nothing like a road, or a railway,
- or planes...?
- Myself!
I could hear myself...
Pathetic!
Tosh...
See, if you don't want anybody knowing about what really happened, like Sandy or Billy...
..that's your call.
It's fine.
But I just...
I find it hard, when I hear you talking like you've got anything to be ashamed of.
I didn't see it coming.
I didn't see the signs.
I walked straight into it!
- How stupid does that make me?
!
- No, no!
This is not about anything you did or didn't do!
Well, what?
What, this is your fault?
How is it your fault?
How's it not?
I'm police.
I'm trained.
I should've known better.
Tosh!
He did this.
- It's not you.
- Yeah!
But I made it easier for him!
You should...
you should get that.
I'll see you back at the office.
Boyd.
- Boss?
The CCTV footage from the airport's just come in.
They're sending it through to both of us now.
OK.
- Where are you now?
- Level Nine.
We've pulled DNA and fingerprints off the stuff of Tosh's they left behind.
I'll let you know if I hear anything from the lab.
Anything else you want me to chase in the meantime?
Yeah.
The airport bar.
A couple of bar bills settled with a Visa card.
Two beers, twice.
OK.
What about the car?
Still a blank on the make.
Hold on.
Are you still there, Boss?
He's never to camera.
He knew we'd be looking.
How we all doing?
I've spoken to Gallowgate.
They upgraded their computer system a few years back.
Apparently, lots of data was lost in the process, including who was working out of the station at the time that report was filed.
Right.
What about the hospitals?
It's a pretty depressing array of possible Burns Night assaults.
- But there is one of them.
- Why?
Just the patient gave a name, but there's a note that says that, when they came to check it, it didn't match any NHS number.
So, what is it, a fake name?
It looks that way, yeah.
- Well, what else does it say?
- Female. 19 years.
"Broken wrist, fractured cheekbone,
"damage to the posterior fourchette..."
- whatever that is.
- That's a sexual assault.
It's a rape.
Get back on to the hospital and see if you can dig up anything else, anything else at all.
OK.
I'm not all right.
I know I'm not all right, but... when I'm here, when I'm working,
I can think straight, I can...
The thing is... ..I feel like myself again when I'm here.
I can see why you would take me off this case.
But, please... please don't.
OK.
If that ever changes... ..or if I ever feel you shouldn't be here... then we're going to have to talk again, OK?
OK.
Tosh...
..we'll find him.
Sir!
The woman was tested for stis and HIV.
She was of no fixed abode, but she asked for the results to be sent to the person who'd brought her in.
Michael Thompson.
So, this data loss at Gallowgate?
Cock-up or conspiracy?
I don't know.
And what about Michael's handler
- Asha Israni?
Can she cast any light on it?
Sure.
- I'll...
I'll get onto that.
- OK.
I'll see you.
- DS Boyd.
- Boss.
We traced the Visa card he used at the airport bar.
Stolen.
So was the car.
We caught it on CCTV leaving the car park.
This wisnae opportunism, this was planned.
OK.
Thanks for letting me know.
Hi.
Hello.
Sorry.
Sorry, I didn't realise you'd landed already.
We...
we landed early.
- Good tailwind, apparently.
- Good.
- Shall we go?
- Sure.
Freya's going to come to the hotel.
She didn't feel comfortable meeting at her house.
Makes sense.
So, Michael never alluded to this incident in any of your conversations?
Nothing about a young woman that he might've helped or, or hurt?
- No.
- Not even a hint?
Look, he didn't even tell me that he had a son.
What makes you think he would have confided in me about this?
My job was to prepare him for his future,
- not rake through his past.
-Yeah, all right, but I mean, you built a relationship with him.
You earned his trust, you knew him.
So what, you want me to guess what his connection to her was?
No!
You're the expert.
I'm inviting you to give an opinion.
OK, well, n my "expert opinion", his relationship with her was probably professional.
Michael once told me that he wasn't leaving a personal life behind, because, after working for Arthur McCall for two decades, he didn't really have one.
Look...
Maybe, when you're through, we could...
I don't know...
Have a drink?
I don't think that would be a good idea.
- Tosh?
- Sir.
I've been on to Gallowgate.
I requested more information - who authorised the upgrade, who implemented it, whether any other data was lost.
I also requested any old notebooks or duty rosters - figured we could find our reporting officer that way.
And?
They say they can't spare anyone to look.
I can't tell if it's a smokescreen
- or if they're just genuine arseholes.
- All right, well...
If Michael Thompson was Arthur's muscle, then was he at Level Nine on that night?
If Arthur McCall had a stake in the club, was Michael working there?
Billy's pulled the company records on Level Nine.
Want me to see what I can dig up?
Why not?
And leave Gallowgate with me.
No, they're claiming that an IT disaster ate their digital records.
And they don't have the manpower to follow a paper trail.
Well, maybe they just don't.
They might if the request came from a Senior Fiscal.
Right, well, are you sure there's a connection between this incident and the murder of Michael Thompson?
At the moment?
It's the best lead we've got!
OK.
OK.
I'll get straight onto it.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Everything all right?
Just... ..we've realised, if we want to be together, then one of us is going have to give up an awful lot.
We're negotiating at the moment as to... which one of us that's going to be.
You saying you might be leaving?
She's got the bigger job and the new grandchild...
I'm not sure what I've got to set against that, so...
And I do miss her.
All the time.
Hi.
Yeah.
Something's come up and we'll need to meet.
Boss?
Just had a call from the Norwegian coastguard.
Apparently, a trawler radioed in to say they'd ran into some wreckage.
It's spread over a wide area, but they think it looks like the remains of a small boat.
It could be our man.
I told them to keep us posted.
OK.
Thanks, Billy.
Sandy, you making any progress with Michael Thompson's file?
Still ploughing through!
Tosh?
Tosh!
I couldn't find a record of Michael Thompson ever having worked at Level Nine, but look who ran their door security.
Do you know a man called Arthur McCall?
Should I?
He had a stake in a club called Level Nine and you used to work there.
I worked in a lot of places.
You know, the thing about having a connection to Arthur McCall is... it's going to make it a hell of a sight easier for us to start tracing that debt of Craig Cooper's that you sold on.
Do you know the maximum sentence for supplying Class A drugs?
I mean, to be honest, I don't think you've got
- that many years left in you.
- Sod off!
A wee bit of cooperation now might soften attitudes somewhere down the line.
Burns Night, ten years ago, there was an assault at the club.
A rape.
Do you remember that?
Aye.
Do you remember what happened?
That it was dealt with.
- How?
- She got took to the hospital.
I imagine... he ended up there, too.
Not the sort of behaviour Arthur...tolerated.
Do you remember her name?
No, just... some tart who did casual bar work.
What about him?
They all look the same to me, those boys.
Young...
dumb... and full of come.
Just like her.
Tosh.
This is her.
I PNC-checked everyone on the Level Nine payroll.
Kelly Paterson.
Occasional barmaid.
In 2005, she'd have been 19 years old, plus...
Convictions for soliciting.
"Tart".
- Tosh, he's...
- Kelly Paterson!
It's her, sir.
I know it is.
Hello, this is Detective Sergeant Mclntosh.
- I'm looking for a Kelly Paterson.
- ..
Is there a Kelly Paterson...?
- ..
Your household with the surname Paterson?
- ..
Kelly Paterson?
..Looking to trace a Kelly Paterson... .. called Level Nine in the East End of Glasgow...
- I see.
- Detective Inspector Perez
.. from the Shetland Police.
We're trying to trace a Kelly Paterson...
I'm sorry, but the person you have called is not available.
Please call back later or leave a message...
No, but thank you anyway.
If you don't make the Glasgow flight, there is one to Edinburgh just after.
Sir?
- Call me?
- Alexander!
- Phone for you!
- The kids have changed my ring tone!
Hello?
OK.
OK, we'll be right there.
- Alexander!
Phone for you!
- Nearly there.
Alexander!
Phone for you!
Factory settings!
Seriously!
You cannot have the fairies calling you at work!
- Him?
- Him.
A new identity, a new life?
Never seeing my family or my friends again?
Well, what kind of future is that?
You could've said no.
Where were you going to send him anyway?
- Canada.
Montreal.
- Montreal?
!
For a man who hated maple syrup and snow?
Did Michael speak French?
- Yeah.
- I don't.
Well, maybe he thought you could learn.
My God, the arrogance!
He didn't take it for granted that you'd say yes.
- He wa...
He was scared.
- I...
Not him, you!
You people!
Is it even possible to walk out of a life and never look back?
You know, Freya, people come to Witness Protection for different reasons.
Some are just unlucky.
They look out of the wrong window at the wrong time and they see something they can't unsee, but... for someone like Michael, it was the only way out of a life he... he no longer wanted.
Look, I know you have questions, but you have to understand that, even if I know the answers, I may not be able to share them.
Look, I have got you something that I can share.
Michael wanted to come clean to you about who he was, the things he did before he met you.
He knew that it might mean losing you, but he wanted to do it anyway.
He said there was no future without honesty.
His charge sheet.
This is what he'd have told you if he'd been here.
I'm glad he found his way out of that world.
I'm glad he found me.
I'm sorry that we lost him for you.
Me too.
- Yeah?
- I'm Detective Inspector Perez.
Is Kelly around?
You haven't missed her by much.
She only went this morning.
Do you know where?
We're more flatmates than friends.
I mean, she got some phone call that freaked her out and she just took off.
I was thinking bailiffs, but...
Is she in trouble with the law?
No.
No, I just want to talk to her.
Can you think of anyone Kelly might've gone stay with?
- Like family or friends or...?
- Sorry.
I mean, like I said, we don't have much to do with each other.
I mean, when I'm working nights, I barely see her.
I'm a nurse.
And what about Kelly?
- What does she do?
- Bar work.
But she's between jobs at the moment.
You know, there was one thing.
She was packing stuff into a bag before she left.
I'm pretty sure I saw her passport.
OK.
See, if you see her, or if she calls... ..could you ask her to call me on that number?
And will you please tell her that she's not in any trouble?
I just want to talk to her, OK?
OK.
I'm sorry I missed your call.
Everything OK?
Listen, a body's just been brought in by a fishing boat.
Sandy's ID'd him as the guy from Scalloway.
- What, the gunman?
- Billy's informing the relevant authorities, but I figure we should keep a blackout on this till we have a name, if only for Freya Galdie's sake.
We're transferring him to the Mainland now for postmortem.
That's if he doesn't burst before they get him into the car.
Speak to you later.
What?
!
He's a man paid to do other people's violence!
I'm supposed to feel sentimental about his carcass?
!
In Shetland, you called me an expensive errand boy.
Well, that's not all I am.
And some of the things I am are sitting less easily with me than they used to.
- Why, what's changed?
- Arthur McCall has changed.
He was always motivated by one thing and one thing only - greed.
Whatever he did was done in the pursuit of profit.
There was a rationale to that.
A logic.
Not any more.
Why?
What's different?
There's a generation coming up behind him.
A new breed.
Perhaps he can feel his power waning or... maybe it's less emotional and more neurological.
I'm sure I could get medical testimony to that effect the next time he's in court.
Either way, he's not a safe person to know any more.
- You telling me you're scared?
- I'm telling you, he is no longer a client I want to represent.
Neither is he a client I can afford to offend.
So, you're saying that, if he was to end up going to prison... ..then that would solve your problems?
OK, then give me something that'll help.
I heard what happened to your colleague.
I'm sorry.
You're trying to find a match for the perpetrator's DNA.
You won't.
No, that doesn't makes sense.
He wasn't clean.
He knew what he was about.
He's got a history...
Hold that thought.
Work with it.
Eddie Kerr's missus was just on the phone.
Says he had a job up north.
Due home a couple of days ago.
Hasn't shown up.
She seems to think you might know something about it.
Eddie Kerr?
I haven't seen him in months.
Jimmy!
I'm glad you came by.
I was just gonnae call you there.
Boyd!
The DNA results are back.
Not a match for anybody on the database.
We're still waiting on the prints, though.
Aye, well, they'll be the same, because this guy's not on our...
Tommy, does Arthur McCall have connections outside of Scotland?
Aye.
Holland, Estonia, Bulgaria.
Aye.
Tosh didn't mention the guy having any kind of accent, though.
Could be one of ours who's been abroad for a while.
They use them in one country and keep them clean in another.
What, a foreign exchange programme?
You ask the Bulgarian police!
- Hello?
- Hi...
I-I wondered if I could still take you up on that drink?
If, if you haven't changed your mind.
No.
No, I haven't changed MY mind.
I've got something to do in the office, 'but I could probably be over at your hotel in about an hour?
'
OK, I'll...
I'll see you then.
Hey, Tosh?
Listen, could I ask you a question?
Yeah.
The DNA that we got from your things in Level Nine... ..is the same as the DNA they got in the SARC at Sandyford.
Now, it didn't match anything on our records, but it showed up on a database in Eastern Europe.
A couple of violent crimes.
Both of them are still unsolved.
So, would you be OK to look at some photographs of potential suspects?
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
Sorry.
It's OK.
Right, so...
How did you end up in Scotland?
I came to university in Glasgow, met someone and then stayed.
Yeah, my daughter's working on a variation of that.
Hers involves following the guy to Brazil.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
How about you?
Why Shetland?
Well, I'm from Fair Isle.
So, for me, it was just a matter of coming home, really.
After your wife died?
Fair Isle.
Isn't that, like, where there's a million sheep and no people?
There's...there's 70 people.
And some sheep.
There's a lot of birds.
And it's very beautiful.
There's actually...
It's about 20 miles that way.
You can see it when it's clear.
Listen, um, I'm sorry about the way I was earlier.
I've been doing this job for a long time now and... some things get harder to live with.
But it wasn't your fault.
Look, what I said to Freya, when I told Freya,
I... really didn't think what that would mean for you.
So, I'm sorry.
Well, I'm not your responsibility.
You...
You know you did the right thing by asking me to come and that's all that matters.
Well, how'd it go?
Yeah, OK.
I-I think she felt better.
And what about you?
Why'd you leave me in Glasgow?
Mmm?
I just woke up and you were gone.
Well, I didn't want to outstay my welcome.
Really?
Yeah, well...
I'm the one with the room this time.
So, you can stay as long as you like.
You were back early last night.
Only my sources told me that you were in the bar at the Lighthouse Hotel with what looked to them very much like a date.
I thought you'd be staying out.
Or maybe bringing home a little company.
Oh, Jesus Christ, man!
Once in a while, throw me a bone, eh?
What is it, Duncan?
!
What is it that you want to know?
I just want to know you're all right.
Tosh...
How're you doing?
All right.
Mainly.
We'll get them.
Kidnap and false imprisonment?
They're looking at years.
But so am I, though, aren't I?
I know justice is what everyone wants.
But I don't want to be stuck where I am now.
And, if it went to trial, I would be.
Like you said... ..years.
It's not about what everyone else wants, though, is it?
It's about what you need.
What if he does it again?
Tosh, you are not answerable for what he does.
He is.
He's your attacker.
He's not your responsibility.
I'm around, you know, if you want to talk.
Thank you.
You've just had another delivery.
This one looks more promising than flowers.
So, this thing at work you cannae tell me about, did you at least tell Asha that's why you were passing up her invitation?
No.
Look, I-I...
I didn't want to make excuses, so I just told her it wisnae a good time.
Jimmy, if you don't tell her, she's going to jump to the obvious conclusion.
What's the obvious conclusion?
Dear God!
James...
I can guarantee you, that at this moment in time, she's thinking she got turned down because either you're not attracted to her, to her, or because you're not ready to move on from the dead wife.
Seriously?
My guess is, she's thinking it's the dead wife.
Christ, I thought it was Fran until you told me otherwise.
Look, I...
I know I'm not in a position to lecture, but there are some things it's just better to come clean about.
Who do you think you are, sending me presents?
Sending me pictures?
Who do you think you are to draw me?
- You don't know me!
- I...
I don't want you to draw me!
I don't want you to look at me.
I never said you could do that.
There's...
a seat you can... you can sit.
Asha?
Can I talk to you for a second?
Yeah, sure.
Come here.
Look, something, something happened.
Very recently at work and it's not my story, I'm just a bystander.
But it's...
It's about how men are with women and I've been struggling with it.
I'm struggling with it.
And I don't want it to intrude.
And so, that's what last night was about and not about anything else.
And...
And not you... and really, really not about you.
I'm sorry I didn't say anything but I've got so used to not sharing things.
I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry.
Will I see you soon?
I'll call you.
OK.
Kelly.
God, how can you stand it?
You know what I mean?
There's nothing to focus on.
It's just horizon.
There's been a rumour about a guy shot in Shetland...
Mick Thompson.
Is that the murder you're investigating?
Yes, It's one of them.
And the only other person I've heard refer to him as Mick... is a man called Arthur McCall.
That's...tea.
And...
I'll be in there.
I'd seen him around but I didn't know him.
He was in this big group.
He was good-looking, you know?
It was Burns Night, I wasn't working,
I was just...
I was just out to please myself.
We started messing about and we ended up outside, round the back.
But he was flying on something and he started to get rough, so I said I wanted to stop, that I wanted go back inside.
And he...
He did what he did.
He raped you.
You went to the police but then you decided to drop the charges...
Why?
A couple of guys from the club came to the station.
Mick, you know, and another guy, Calvin.
They said Arthur didn't want to give the cops an excuse to poke around.
They said they'd look after me and they'd take care of the guy that did it.
I was a user.
I had a history of selling sex.
My injuries could have come from a violent punter.
I mean, the cop's weren't going to take it anywhere, anyway.
Well, then, why go to them in the first place?
Kelly?
I didn't have many choices back then.
Needle or smoke.
Tea or coffee.
Who I said, "no" to.
I said "no" to him and he broke my bones and he hurt me.
What about Michael Thompson?
He was good to me.
Not just then but... for a long time after.
He looked out for me.
And he treated me the way he thought I should treat myself.
With consideration.
And I do now.
I just wish I'd been able to show him that.
Can you remember the names of any of the police officers that you spoke to?
And the name of the man who assaulted you?
He was a student.
They called him "BB".
You know, like the air gun.
Those were his initials.
Ben Brennan.
Yeah.
They should only take me a couple of hours to sort out.
Thanks, Billy, you're a life-saver.
Aye, that's me!
- Rhona?
- Yeah?
- Phyllis's son.
- Ben?
Yes.
Did he go to university in Glasgow?
Yeah.
Why?
Just... trying to figure something out.
So, Phyllis Brenan's son... ..and Arthur McCall... ..makes it go away.
That's big.
That's bigger than just Arthur McCall.
So, what does Arthur ask for in return?
Everything.
I mean, ten years on and he's still a free man, isn't he?
OK.
Then we should get the paperwork on McCall and we should...
- What?
- I don't know.
Kelly.
I mean, do you ever think what it must be like to have something like that happen to you and for there to be no redress?
Things have changed since then.
We'd handle it different now.
Right, so you think that if Kelly was to walk in here tomorrow with the same story, that we'd get a conviction?
And that she wouldnae be asked on the stand what she was wearing and how many sexual partners she'd had?
We should be doing better by them.
Is she around?
No, she's gone for the day.
I could call her...
No.
Billy, I'm moving out of my flat for a bit.
I'm going to be staying with my friends Beth and Roz for a while.
I'll give you the details.
The thing is...
It wasn't just the car... ..and the hood over my head in Glasgow.
There was more.
You know?
You know.
Could you please tell Sandy for me?
- I want him to know...
- Aye, aye, I'll tell him.
I would like to give you a hug.
Would that be allowed?
Sorry.
Hey, lady, you call the shots round here.
Night.
No...
No, this doesn't make sense.
It's just that there is not enough.
But McCall has dodged prison again and again!
Yeah, because he's got a good lawyer.
If Michael Thompson hadn't been shot,
McCall was looking at life in prison.
Every time that he's investigated, he suffers, his business suffers.
Think about it.
If you had a Senior Fiscal in your pocket, then wouldn't you expect better protection than this?
What if it's not McCall who's been benefitting from Phyllis Brenan's protection?
But if not McCall... ..then who?

The gunman was late dropping off the car.
'He missed the boat.'
They're calling again.
I'm going to need the name of Robbie's partner.
See, you and me, we haven't even got started yet!
'Whatever Michael Thompson was going to tell them, ' it was bigger than just Arthur McCall.
'Level Nine...
Burn...'
Please, get them talk to me.
I'll meet Freya, but, er, not here.
Shetland.
My work is not to everybody's taste.
That club
- Level Nine?
It was owned and run by one of McCall's men.
Cheers!
- Who's that?
- Calvin Sarwar.
Your client would like me to...?
Refocus your investigation.
I think something happened in Level Nine on Burns Night.
- 'This flight has been delayed.'
- Is it a two-pint delay?
She definitely had a ticket.
She just didn't get on the flight.
Jimmy!
It's Tosh!
She just walked into a police station in Cambuslang.
She's fine, Jimmy.
She's fine, OK?
Right.
Apparently, they put a hood over her head, drove her to the edge of the city and left her to walk back without her shoes.
Other than that, she's not been hurt.
OK?
OK.
She wanted to wait on a doctor till you got here.
Right, well, then, let's get you seen to, then?
- Right.
You got any preference as to AE departments?
- No.
No, I mean no, not a hospital.
Sandyford.
The SARC.
He said I was a message you couldn't ignore.
How do you like to be called?
Alison?
Is Alison OK?
Do you want to talk to a police officer, Alison?
We're not the police, we're independent, but if you want to talk to someone...
- No.
No police.
But you would like us to gather evidence, is that right?
Would you like somebody with you while we do this, Alison?
Are you there?
Yeah, I'm here.
Have you washed since the event, Alison?
No.
- Have you brushed your teeth?
- No.
- Did you vomit?
- Yes.
After.
Are you aware of any injuries?
No.
I didn't fight.
I just did what he said.
Yeah, I know they say flight or fight, but sometimes, your body just closes down.
And there are some injuries here.
You're just not always aware at the time.
Are you sure she's all right?
(I mean, if I'd been bundled intae a car
(and a bag stuck over my head
(and dropped outside the city without any shoes on,
(I don't think I'd be straight back to work.)
Hey!
You're looking all right.
I AM all right.
- What about you?
- Oh, you know.
Sore.
But fine.
From the Guizer Jarl and the Jarl Squad.
We're not the only ones glad to have her home safe and sound.
OK.
So, what have we got on this Burns Night attack at Level Nine?
Maybe the reporting officer just forgot to put the complainant's name down?
- And their own?
No.
Someone's covering something and we're definitely looking in the right place or they wouldn't have bothered trying to warn us off.
- Sandy... check the hospitals, maybe our victim needed medical attention.
And see if you can find out who the police surgeon at Gallowgate was at the time.
Er...
Billy?
Now, either that report was filed incomplete or it was tampered with after.
Whichever way it happened, we need to know who was working out of Gallowgate at the time.
- Yeah.
- Also, pull everything you can find about Level Nine - company directors, trading history, accounts, payroll - whatever you can find.
Right, Tosh?
We should go through your statement.
Do you want to do this somewhere else?
Yeah.
At the airport bar, what did you drink?
Beer.
How many?
Three.
- Who paid?
- Him.
Then me, then him again.
And did he pay by card or by cash?
Card.
A visa.
And then?
They announced another delay to the flight.
He said he knew a good bar.
He said we should take a cab.
When we got outside, there was one waiting.
A black saloon.
You still can't remember the make?
After a couple of minutes, I thought we were going the wrong way, so I turned to look out of the window.
He must've had the hood in his pocket.
Did he say anything?
Just... words.
Names.
You know...
The names women always get called.
Do you know how far you drove?
We could've been going in circles!
I couldn't see.
Right, when you got to the place inside... could you hear anything?
Nothing like a road, or a railway, or planes...?
- Myself!
I could hear myself...
Pathetic!
Tosh...
See, if you don't want anybody knowing about what really happened, like Sandy or Billy that's your call.
It's fine.
But I just...
I find it hard, when I hear you talking like you've got anything to be ashamed of.
I didn't see it coming.
I didn't see the signs.
I walked straight into it!
- How stupid does that make me?
!
- No, no!
This is not about anything you did or didn't do!
Well, what?
- What, this is your fault?
How is it your fault?
- How's it not?
I'm police.
I'm trained.
- I should've known better.
- Tosh!
HE did this.
- It's not you.
- Yeah!
But I made it easier for him!
You should... you should get that.
I'll see you back at the office.
- 'Boyd.'
- Boss?
The CCTV footage from the airport's just come in.
- They're sending it through to both of us now.
- OK.
- Er, where are you now?
- 'Er, Level Nine.'
We've pulled DNA and fingerprints off the stuff of Tosh's they left behind.
I'll let you know if I hear anything from the lab.
- 'Anything else you want me to chase in the meantime?
'
- Um, yeah.
The airport bar.
A couple of bar bills settled 'with a visa card.
Two beers, twice.'
OK.
Er, what about the car?
'Still a blank on the make.'
Hold on.
'Are you still there, Boss?
'
He's never to camera.
He knew we'd be looking.
Hey.
How we all doing?
I've spoken to Gallowgate.
They upgraded their computer system a few years back.
Apparently, lots of data was lost in the process, including who was working out of the station at the time that report was filed.
Right.
What about the hospitals?
Oh, it's a pretty depressing array of possible Burns Night assaults.
- But there is one of them.
- What?
Just the patient gave a name, but there's a note that says that, when they came to check it, it didn't match any NHS number.
- So, what is it, a fake name?
- It looks that way, yeah.
- Well, what else does it say?
- Female. 19 years.
"Broken wrist, fractured cheekbone,
"damage to the posterior fourchette..."
whatever that is.
- That's a sexual assault.
It's a rape.
Get back on to the hospital and see if you can dig up anything else, anything else at all.
- OK
Hey.
I'm not all right.
I know I'm not all right, but... when I'm here, when I'm working, I can think straight, I can...
The thing is I feel like myself again when I'm here.
I can see why you would take me off this case.
But, please... please don't.
OK.
If that ever changes or if I ever feel you shouldn't be here... then we're going to have to talk again, OK?
OK.
Tosh we'll find him.
Sir!
The woman was tested for stis and HIV.
She was of no fixed abode, but she asked for the results to be sent to the person who'd brought her in.
Michael Thompson.
- So, this data loss at Gallowgate?
- Mm-hm?
Cock-up or conspiracy?
I don't know.
And what about Michael's handler
- Asha Israni?
Can she cast any light on it?
Sure.
- I'll...
I'll get onto that.
- OK.
I'll see you.
- DS Boyd.
- 'Boss.'
We traced the Visa card he used at the airport bar.
Stolen.
'So was the car.
We caught it on CCTV leaving the car park.'
This wisnae opportunism, this was planned.
OK.
Thanks for letting me know.
Hi.
Oh, hello.
Er, sorry.
Sorry, I didn't realise you'd landed already.
- Oh, we... we landed early.
Good tailwind, apparently.
- Good.
- Shall we go?
- Sure.
Freya's going to come to the hotel.
She didn't feel comfortable meeting at her house.
Makes sense.
So, Michael never alluded to this incident in any of your conversations?
- Nothing about a young woman that he might've helped or, or hurt?
- No.
- Not even a hint?
- Look, he didn't even tell me that he had a son.
What makes you think he would have confided in me about this?
My job was to prepare him for his future, not rake through his past.
Yeah, all right, but I mean, you built a relationship with him.
You earned his trust, you knew him.
- So what, you want me to guess what his connection to her was?
- No!
You're the expert.
I'm inviting you to give an opinion.
OK, well, in my "expert opinion", his relationship with her was probably professional.
Michael once told me that he wasn't leaving a personal life behind, because, after working for Arthur McCall for two decades, he didn't really have one.
Look, er...
Maybe, when you're through, we could...
I don't know...
Have a drink?
I don't think that would be a good idea.
- Tosh?
- 'Sir.'
I've been on to Gallowgate.
I requested more information - who authorised the upgrade, who implemented it, whether any other data was lost.
'I also requested any old notebooks or duty rosters 'figured we could find our reporting officer that way.'
- And?
They say they can't spare anyone to look.
I can't tell if it's a smokescreen or if they're just genuine arseholes.
- 'All right, well...'
If Michael Thompson was Arthur's muscle, 'then was he at Level Nine on that night?
'
If Arthur McCall had a stake in the club, was Michael working there?
Billy's pulled the company records on Level Nine.
Want me to see what I can dig up?
Why not?
And leave Gallowgate with me.
No, they're claiming that an IT disaster ate their digital records.
'And they don't have the manpower to follow a paper trail.'
Well, maybe they just don't.
They might if the request came from a Senior Fiscal.
Right, well, are you sure there's a connection between this incident
- 'and the murder of Michael Thompson?
'
- At the moment?
It's the best lead we've got!
OK.
OK.
I'll get straight onto it.
- Bye.
- 'Bye.'
Everything all right?
Just we've realised, if we want to be together, then one of us is going have to give up an awful lot.
We're negotiating at the moment as to... which one of us that's going to be.
You saying you might be leaving?
She's got the bigger job and the new grandchild...
Mm-hm?
I'm not sure what I've got to set against that, so...
And I do miss her.
All the time.
Hi.
Yeah.
Something's come up and we'll need to meet.
Oh, Boss?
Just had a call from the Norwegian coastguard.
Apparently, a trawler radioed in to say they'd ran into some wreckage.
It's spread over a wide area, but they think it looks like the remains of a small boat.
It could be our man.
- I told them to keep us posted.
- OK.
Thanks, Billy.
Sandy, you making any progress with Michael Thompson's file?
Still ploughing through!
Tosh?
Tosh!
I couldn't find a record of Michael Thompson ever having worked at Level Nine, but look who ran their door security.
Do you know a man called Arthur McCall?
- Should I?
- He had a stake in a club called Level Nine and you used to work there.
I worked in a lot of places.
You know, the thing about having a connection to Arthur McCall is... it's going to make it a hell of a sight easier for us to start tracing that debt of Craig Cooper's that you sold on.
Do you know the maximum sentence for supplying Class A drugs?
I mean, to be honest, I don't think you've got
- that many years left in you.
- Sod off!
A wee bit of cooperation now might soften attitudes somewhere down the line.
Burns Night, ten years ago, there was an assault at the club.
A rape.
Do you remember that?
Aye.
Do you remember what happened?
That it was dealt with.
- How?
- She got took to the hospital.
I imagine... he ended up there, too.
Not the sort of behaviour Arthur... tolerated.
Do you remember her name?
No, just... some tart who did casual bar work.
What about him?
They all look the same to me, those boys.
Young... dumb... and full of come.
Just like her.
Tosh.
This is her.
I PNC-checked everyone on the Level Nine payroll.
Kelly Paterson.
Occasional barmaid.
In 2005, she'd have been 19 years old, plus...
Convictions for soliciting.
"Tart".
- Tosh, he's, er...
- Kelly Paterson!
It's her, sir.
I know it is.
Hello, this is Detective Sergeant Mclntosh.
- I'm looking for a Kelly Paterson.
- ..
Is there a Kelly Paterson...?
- ...
Your household with the surname Paterson?
- ..
Kelly Paterson?
...Looking to trace a Kelly Paterson...
- ...
A club called Level Nine in the East End of Glasgow...
- I see.
...Detective Inspector Perez from the Shetland Police.
We're trying to trace a Kelly Paterson...
'I'm sorry, but the person you have called is not available.
'Please call back later or leave a message...'
No, but thank you anyway.
If you don't make the Glasgow flight, there is one to Edinburgh just after.
Sir?
- Call me?
- 'Alexander!
- 'Phone for you!
'
- The kids have changed my ring tone!
Hello?
OK.
OK, we'll be right there.
- 'Alexander!
Phone for you!
'
- Nearly there.
'Alexander!
Phone for you!
'
Factory settings!
Seriously!
You cannot have the fairies calling you at work!
Him?
Him.
A new identity, a new life?
Never seeing my family or my friends again?
Well, what kind of future is that?
You could've said no.
Where were you going to send him anyway?
Canada.
Montreal.
Montreal?
!
For a man who hated maple syrup and snow?
Oh...
Did Michael speak French?
- Yeah.
- I don't.
- Well, maybe he thought you could learn.
- Oh, my God, the arrogance!
He didn't take it for granted that you'd say yes.
- He wa...
He was scared.
- I...
Not him, YOU!
You people!
Is it even possible to walk out of a life and never look back?
You know, Freya, people come to Witness Protection for different reasons.
Some are just unlucky.
They look out of the wrong window at the wrong time and they see something they can't unsee, but... for someone like Michael, it was the only way out of a life he... he no longer wanted.
Look, I know you have questions, but you have to understand that, even if I know the answers, I may not be able to share them.
Look, I have got you something that I can share.
Michael wanted to come clean to you about who he was, the things he did before he met you.
He knew that it might mean losing you, but he wanted to do it anyway.
He said there was no future without honesty.
His charge sheet.
This is what he'd have told you if he'd been here.
I'm glad he found his way out of that world.
I'm glad he found me.
I'm sorry that we lost him for you.
Me too.
- Yeah?
- I'm Detective Inspector Perez.
Is Kelly around?
You haven't missed her by much.
She only went this morning.
Do you know where?
We're more flatmates than friends.
I mean, she got some phone call that freaked her out and she just took off.
I was thinking bailiffs, but...
Is she in trouble with the law?
No.
No, I just want to talk to her.
Can you think of anyone Kelly might've gone stay with?
- Like family or friends or...?
- Sorry.
I mean, like I said, we don't have much to do with each other.
I mean, when I'm working nights, I barely see her.
I'm a nurse.
And what about Kelly?
- What does she do?
- Bar work.
But she's between jobs at the moment.
You know, there was one thing.
She was packing stuff into a bag before she left.
I'm pretty sure I saw her passport.
OK.
See, if you see her, or if she calls could you ask her to call me on that number?
And will you please tell her that she's not in any trouble?
I just want to talk to her, OK?
OK.
'I'm sorry I missed your call.
Everything OK?
'
Listen, a body's just been brought in by a fishing boat.
'Sandy's ID'd him as the guy from Scalloway.'
- What, the gunman?
- 'Billy's informing the relevant authorities, ' but I figure we should keep a blackout on this till we have a name, if only for Freya Galdie's sake.
We're transferring him to the Mainland now for postmortem.
That's if he doesn't burst before they get him into the car.
Speak to you later.
What?
!
He's a man paid to do other people's violence!
I'm supposed to feel sentimental about his carcass?
!
In Shetland, you called me an expensive errand boy.
Well, that's not all I am.
And some of the things I am are sitting less easily with me than they used to.
- Why, what's changed?
- Arthur McCall has changed.
He was always motivated by one thing and one thing only - greed.
Whatever he did was done in the pursuit of profit.
There was a rationale to that.
A logic.
Not any more.
Why?
What's different?
There's a generation coming up behind him.
A new breed.
Perhaps he can feel his power waning or... maybe it's less emotional and more neurological.
I'm sure I could get medical testimony to that effect the next time he's in court.
Either way, he's not a safe person to know any more.
You telling me you're scared?
I'm telling you, he is no longer a client I want to represent.
Neither is he a client I can afford to offend.
So, you're saying that, if he was to end up going to prison then that would solve your problems?
OK, then give me something that'll help.
I heard what happened to your colleague.
I'm sorry.
You're trying to find a match for the perpetrator's DNA.
You won't.
No, that doesn't makes sense.
He wasn't clean.
- He knew what he was about.
He's got a history...
- Hold that thought.
Work with it.
Eddie Kerr's missus was just on the phone.
Says he had a job up north.
Due home a couple of days ago.
Hasn't shown up.
She seems to think you might know something about it.
Eddie Kerr?
I haven't seen him in months.
Jimmy!
- I'm glad you came by.
I was just gonnae call you there.
- Uh-huh?
Boyd!
The DNA results are back.
Not a match for anybody on the database.
We're still waiting on the prints, though.
Aye, well, they'll be the same, because this guy's not on our...
Tommy, does Arthur McCall have connections outside of Scotland?
Oh, aye.
Holland, Estonia, Bulgaria.
Aye.
Tosh didn't mention the guy having any kind of accent, though.
Could be one of ours who's been abroad for a while.
They use them in one country and keep them clean in another.
What, a foreign exchange programme?
You ask the Bulgarian police!
Hello?
Hi, er...
I-I wondered if I could still take you up on that drink?
- 'If, if you haven't changed your mind.'
- No.
No, I haven't changed MY mind.
'I've got something to do in the office, 'but I could probably be over at your hotel in about an hour?
'
OK, I'll, er...
I'll see you then.
Hey, Tosh?
Listen, could I ask you a question?
Yeah.
The DNA that we got from your things in Level Nine is the same as the DNA they got in the SARC at Sandyford.
Now, it didn't match anything on our records, but it showed up on a database in Eastern Europe.
A couple of violent crimes.
Both of them are still unsolved.
So, would you be OK to look at some photographs of potential suspects?
No.
No.
Mm-mm.
No.
No.
No.
Sorry.
It's OK.
Right, so...
How did you end up in Scotland?
I came to university in Glasgow, met someone and then stayed.
Yeah, my daughter's working on a variation of that.
Hers involves following the guy to Brazil.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
How about you?
Why Shetland?
Well, I'm from Fair Isle.
So, for me, it was just a matter of coming home, really.
- After your wife died?
- Uh-huh.
Fair Isle.
Isn't that, like, where there's a million sheep and no people?
- There's... there's 70 people.
- Ah.
- And some sheep.
There's a lot of birds.
And it's very beautiful.
There's actually...
It's about 20 miles that way.
You can see it when it's clear.
Listen, um, I'm sorry about the way I was earlier.
I've been doing this job for a long time now and... some things get harder to live with.
But it wasn't your fault.
Look, what I said to Freya, when I told Freya, er, I... really didn't think what that would mean for you.
So, I'M sorry.
Well, I'm not your responsibility.
You...
You know you did the right thing by asking me to come and that's all that matters.
Well, how'd it go?
Yeah, OK.
I-I think she felt better.
- And what about you?
- Oh...
Why'd you leave me in Glasgow?
Mmm?
I just woke up and you were gone.
Well, I didn't want to outstay my welcome.
Really?
Yeah, well...
I'm the one with the room this time.
So, you can stay as long as you like.
You were back early last night.
Ahem, only my sources told me that you were in the bar at the Lighthouse Hotel with what looked to them very much like a date.
I thought you'd be staying out.
Or maybe bringing home a little company.
Oh, Jesus Christ, man!
Once in a while, throw me a bone, eh?
What is it, Duncan?
!
What is it that you want to know?
I just want to know you're all right.
Tosh...
How're you doing?
All right.
Mainly.
We'll get them.
Kidnap and false imprisonment?
They're looking at years.
But so am I, though, aren't I?
I know justice is what everyone wants.
But I don't want to be stuck where I am now.
And, if it went to trial, I would be.
Like you said years.
It's not about what everyone else wants, though, is it?
It's about what you need.
What if he does it again?
Tosh, you are not answerable for what he does.
He is.
He's your attacker.
He's not your responsibility.
I'm around, you know, if you want to talk.
Thank you.
You've just had another delivery.
This one looks more promising than flowers.
So, this thing at work you cannae tell me about, did you at least tell Asha that's why you were passing up her invitation?
No.
Look, I-I...
I didn't want to make excuses, so I just told her it wisnae a good time.
Jimmy, if you don't tell her, she's going to jump to the obvious conclusion.
What's the obvious conclusion?
Oh...
Dear God!
James...
I can guarantee you, that at this moment in time, she's thinking she got turned down because either you're not attracted to her, or because you're not ready to move on from the dead wife.
Seriously?
My guess is, she's thinking it's the dead wife.
Christ, I thought it was Fran until you told me otherwise.
Look, I...
I know I'm not in a position to lecture, but there are some things it's just better to come clean about.
Who do you think you are, sending me presents?
Sending me pictures?
Who do you think you are to draw me?
You don't know me!
- I...
- I don't want you to draw me!
I don't want you to look at me.
I never said you could do that.
Erm, there's, er... a seat you can... you can sit.
Asha?
Can I talk to you for a second?
Er... yeah, sure.
Come here.
Look, something, something happened.
Very recently at work and it's not my story, I'm just a... bystander.
But it's...
It's about how men are with women and I've been struggling with it.
I'm struggling with it.
And I don't want it to intrude.
And so, that's what last night was about and not about anything else.
And...
And not you... and really, really not about you.
I'm sorry I didn't say anything but I've got so used to not sharing things.
I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry.
Will I see you soon?
I'll call you.
OK.
Kelly.
God, how can you stand it?
You know what I mean?
There's nothing to focus on.
It's just horizon.
There's been a rumour about a guy shot in Shetland...
Mick Thompson.
Is that the murder you're investigating?
Yes, It's one of them.
And the only other person I've heard refer to him as Mick... is a man called Arthur McCall.
That's, um... tea.
And, um...
I'll be in there.
I'd seen him around but I didn't know him.
He was in this big group.
He was good-looking, you know?
It was Burns Night, I wasn't working, I was just...
I was just out to please myself.
We started messing about and we ended up outside, round the back.
But he was flying on something and he started to get rough, so I said I wanted to stop, that I wanted go back inside.
And he...
He did what he did.
He raped you.
You went to the police but then you decided to drop the charges...
Why?
A couple of guys from the club came to the station.
Mick, you know, and another guy, Calvin.
They said Arthur didn't want to give the cops an excuse to poke around.
They said they'd look after me and they'd take care of the guy that did it.
I was a user.
I had a history of selling sex.
My injuries could have come from a violent punter.
I mean, the cop's weren't going to take it anywhere, anyway.
Well, then, why go to them in the first place?
Kelly?
I didn't have many choices back then.
Needle or smoke.
Tea or coffee.
Who I said, "no" to.
I said "no" to him and he broke my bones and he hurt me.
What about Michael Thompson?
He was good to me.
Not just then but... for a long time after.
He looked out for me.
And he treated me the way he thought I should treat myself.
With consideration.
And I do now.
I just wish I'd been able to show him that.
Can you remember the names of any of the police officers that you spoke to?
And the name of the man who assaulted you?
He was a student.
They called him "BB".
You know, like the air gun.
Those were his initials.
Ben Brennan.
Yeah.
They should only take me a couple of hours to sort out.
Thanks, Billy, you're a life-saver.
Aye, that's me!
- Rhona?
- Yeah?
Phyllis's son.
Ben?
- Yes.
Did he go to university in Glasgow?
- Yeah.
Why?
Just... trying to figure something out.
So, Phyllis Brenan's son and Arthur McCall makes it go away.
That's big.
That's bigger than just Arthur McCall.
- So, what does Arthur ask for in return?
- Everything.
I mean, ten years on and he's still a free man, isn't he?
OK.
Then we should get the paperwork on McCall and we should...
What?
I don't know.
Kelly.
I mean, do you ever think what it must be like to have something like that happen to you and for there to be no redress?
Mm...
Things have changed since then.
We'd handle it different now.
Right, so you think that if Kelly was to walk in here tomorrow with the same story, that we'd get a conviction?
And that she wouldnae be asked on the stand what she was wearing and how many sexual partners she'd had?
We should be doing better by them.
Is she around?
- No, she's gone for the day.
I could call her...
- No.
Billy, I'm moving out of my flat for a bit.
I'm going to be staying with my friends Beth and Roz for a while.
I'll give you the details.
The thing is...
It wasn't just the car..
...and the hood over my head in Glasgow.
There was more.
You know?
You know.
Could you please tell Sandy for me?
I want him to know...
Aye, aye, I'll tell him.
I would like to give you a hug.
Would that be allowed?
Sorry.
Hey, lady, you call the shots round here.
Night.
No...
No, this doesn't make sense.
It's just that there is not enough.
But McCall has dodged prison again and again!
Yeah, because he's got a good lawyer.
If Michael Thompson hadn't been shot,
McCall was looking at life in prison.
Every time that he's investigated, he suffers, his business suffers.
Think about it.
If you had a Senior Fiscal in your pocket, then wouldn't you expect better protection than this?
'What if it's not McCall 'who's been benefitting from Phyllis Brenan's protection?
'But if not McCall... '..then who?
The gunman was late dropping off the car.
'He missed the boat.' LOUD THUD, MAN GRUNTS
They're calling again.
I'm going to need the name of Robbie's partner.
See, you and me, we haven't even got started yet!
'Whatever Michael Thompson was going to tell them,' it was bigger than just Arthur McCall.
- MICHAEL:
- 'Level Nine...
Burn...'
Please, get them talk to me.
I'll meet Freya, but, er, not here.
Shetland.
My work is not to everybody's taste.
That club
- Level Nine?
It was owned and run by one of McCall's men.
- ALL:
Cheers!
- Who's that?
- Calvin Sarwar.
Your client would like me to...?
Refocus your investigation.
I think something happened in Level Nine on Burns Night.
- OVER TANNOY:
- 'This flight has been delayed.'
- Is it a two-pint delay?
SHE LAUGHS
She definitely had a ticket.
She just didn't get on the flight.

It's Tosh!
She just walked into a police station in Cambuslang.
She's fine, Jimmy.
She's fine, OK?
Right.
Apparently, they put a hood over her head, drove her to the edge of the city and left her to walk back without her shoes.
Other than that, she's not been hurt.
OK?
OK.
She wanted to wait on a doctor till you got here.
Right, well, then, let's get you seen to, then?

Do you want to talk to a police officer, Alison?
We're not the police, we're independent,

- No.
No police.
But you would like us to gather evidence, is that right?
Would you like somebody with you while we do this, Alison?
Are you there?
Yeah, I'm here.
Have you washed since the event, Alison?
No.
- Have you brushed your teeth?
- No.
- Did you vomit?
- Yes.
After.
Are you aware of any injuries?
No.
I didn't fight.
I just did what he said.
Yeah, I know they say flight or fight, but sometimes, your body just closes down.
And there are some injuries here.
You're just not always aware at the time.

Hey!
You're looking all right.
I AM all right.
- What about you?
- Oh, you know.
Sore.
But fine.
From the Guizer Jarl and the Jarl Squad.
We're not the only ones glad to have her home safe and sound.
OK.
So, what have we got on this Burns Night attack at Level Nine?
Maybe the reporting officer just forgot
- to put the complainant's name down?
- And their own?
No.
Someone's covering something and we're definitely looking in the right place
- or they wouldn't have bothered trying to warn us off.
- Sandy... check the hospitals, maybe our victim needed medical attention.
And see if you can find out who the police surgeon at Gallowgate was at the time.
Er...
Billy?
Now, either that report was filed incomplete or it was tampered with after.
Whichever way it happened, we need to know who was working out of Gallowgate at the time.
- Yeah.
- Also, pull everything you can find about Level Nine - company directors, trading history, accounts, payroll - whatever you can find.
Right, Tosh?
We should go through your statement.
Do you want to do this somewhere else?
Yeah.
At the airport bar, what did you drink?
Beer.
How many?
Three.
- Who paid?
- Him.
Then me, then him again.
And did he pay by card or by cash?
Card.
A visa.
And then?
They announced another delay to the flight.
He said he knew a good bar.
He said we should take a cab.
When we got outside, there was one waiting.
A black saloon.
You still can't remember the make?
After a couple of minutes, I thought we were going the wrong way, so I turned to look out of the window.
He must've had the hood in his pocket.
Did he say anything?
Just...words.
Names.
You know...
The names women always get called.
Do you know how far you drove?
We could've been going in circles!
I couldn't see.
Right, when you got to the place... ..inside... could you hear anything?
Nothing like a road, or a railway,
- or planes...?
- Myself!
I could hear myself...
Pathetic!
Tosh...
See, if you don't want anybody knowing about what really happened, like Sandy or Billy...
..that's your call.
It's fine.
But I just...
I find it hard, when I hear you talking like you've got anything to be ashamed of.
I didn't see it coming.
I didn't see the signs.
I walked straight into it!
- How stupid does that make me?
!
- No, no!
This is not about anything you did or didn't do!
Well, what?
- What, this is your fault?
How is it your fault?
- How's it not?
I'm police.
I'm trained.
- I should've known better.
- Tosh!
HE did this.
- It's not you.
- Yeah!
But I made it easier for him!

- OK.
- Er, where are you now?

We've pulled DNA and fingerprints off the stuff of Tosh's they left behind.
I'll let you know if I hear anything from the lab.
- 'Anything else you want me to chase in the meantime?
'
- Um, yeah.
The airport bar.
A couple of bar bills settled 'with a visa card.
Two beers, twice.'
OK.
Er, what about the car?
'Still a blank on the make.'
Hold on.
'Are you still there, Boss?
'
He's never to camera.
He knew we'd be looking.
Hey.
How we all doing?
I've spoken to Gallowgate.
They upgraded their computer system a few years back.
Apparently, lots of data was lost in the process, including who was working out of the station at the time that report was filed.
Right.
What about the hospitals?
Oh, it's a pretty depressing array of possible Burns Night assaults.
- But there is one of them.
- What?
Just the patient gave a name, but there's a note that says that, when they came to check it, it didn't match any NHS number.
- So, what is it, a fake name?
- It looks that way, yeah.
- Well, what else does it say?
- Female. 19 years.
"Broken wrist, fractured cheekbone,
"damage to the posterior fourchette..."
- whatever that is.
- That's a sexual assault.
It's a rape.
Get back on to the hospital
- and see if you can dig up anything else, anything else at all.
- OK
QUIET SOBBING
Hey.
I'm not all right.
I know I'm not all right, but... when I'm here, when I'm working, I can think straight, I can...
The thing is... ..I feel like myself again when I'm here.
I can see why you would take me off this case.
But, please... please don't.
OK.
If that ever changes... ..or if I ever feel you shouldn't be here... then we're going to have to talk again, OK?
OK.
Tosh...
..we'll find him.
Sir!
The woman was tested for STIs and HIV.
She was of no fixed abode, but she asked for the results to be sent to the person who'd brought her in.
Michael Thompson.
- So, this data loss at Gallowgate?
- Mm-hm?
Cock-up or conspiracy?
I don't know.
And what about Michael's handler
- Asha Israni?
Can she cast any light on it?
Sure.
- I'll...
I'll get onto that.
- OK.
I'll see you.
MOBILE PHONE RINGS
- DS Boyd.
- 'Boss.'
We traced the Visa card he used at the airport bar.
Stolen.
'So was the car.
We caught it on CCTV leaving the car park.'
This wisnae opportunism, this was planned.
OK.
Thanks for letting me know.
Hi.
Oh, hello.
Er, sorry.
Sorry, I didn't realise you'd landed already.
- Oh, we...we landed early.
Good tailwind, apparently.
- Good.
- Shall we go?
- Sure.
Freya's going to come to the hotel.
She didn't feel comfortable meeting at her house.
Makes sense.
So, Michael never alluded to this incident in any of your conversations?
- Nothing about a young woman that he might've helped or, or hurt?
- No.
- Not even a hint?
- Look, he didn't even tell me that he had a son.
What makes you think he would have confided in me about this?
My job was to prepare him for his future, not rake through his past.
Yeah, all right, but I mean, you built a relationship with him.
You earned his trust, you knew him.
- So what, you want me to guess what his connection to her was?
- No!
You're the expert.
I'm inviting you to give an opinion.
OK, well, in my "expert opinion", his relationship with her was probably professional.
Michael once told me that he wasn't leaving a personal life behind, because, after working for Arthur McCall for two decades, he didn't really have one.
Look, er...
Maybe, when you're through, we could...
I don't know...
Have a drink?
I don't think that would be a good idea.
MOBILE PHONE RINGS
KEYPAD TONE
- Tosh?
- 'Sir.'
I've been on to Gallowgate.
I requested more information - who authorised the upgrade, who implemented it, whether any other data was lost.
'I also requested any old notebooks or duty rosters 'figured we could find our reporting officer that way.'
- And?
They say they can't spare anyone to look.
I can't tell if it's a smokescreen
- or if they're just genuine arseholes.
- 'All right, well...'
If Michael Thompson was Arthur's muscle, 'then was he at Level Nine on that night?
'
If Arthur McCall had a stake in the club, was Michael working there?
Billy's pulled the company records on Level Nine.
Want me to see what I can dig up?
Why not?
And leave Gallowgate with me.
PHONE DISCONNECTS
No, they're claiming that an IT disaster ate their digital records.
'And they don't have the manpower to follow a paper trail.'
Well, maybe they just don't.
They might if the request came from a Senior Fiscal.
Right, well, are you sure there's a connection between this incident
- 'and the murder of Michael Thompson?
'
- At the moment?
It's the best lead we've got!
OK.
OK.
I'll get straight onto it.
- Bye.
- 'Bye.'
SHE SIGHS
Everything all right?
- Just...
- SHE SIGHS DEEPLY
..we've realised, if we want to be together, then one of us is going have to give up an awful lot.
We're negotiating at the moment as to... which one of us that's going to be.
You saying you might be leaving?
She's got the bigger job and the new grandchild...
Mm-hm?
I'm not sure what I've got to set against that, so...
And I do miss her.
All the time.

Just had a call from the Norwegian coastguard.
Apparently, a trawler radioed in to say they'd ran into some wreckage.
It's spread over a wide area, but they think it looks like the remains of a small boat.
It could be our man.
- I told them to keep us posted.
- OK.
Thanks, Billy.
Sandy, you making any progress with Michael Thompson's file?
Still ploughing through!

I couldn't find a record of Michael Thompson ever having worked at Level Nine, but look who ran their door security.

Do you know a man called Arthur McCall?
- Should I?
- He had a stake in a club called Level Nine and you used to work there.
I worked in a lot of places.
You know, the thing about having a connection to Arthur McCall is... it's going to make it a hell of a sight easier for us to start tracing that debt of Craig Cooper's that you sold on.
Do you know the maximum sentence for supplying Class A drugs?
I mean, to be honest, I don't think you've got
- that many years left in you.
HE SNORTS:
- Sod off!
A wee bit of cooperation now might soften attitudes somewhere down the line.
Burns Night, ten years ago, there was an assault at the club.
A rape.
Do you remember that?
Aye.
Do you remember what happened?
That it was dealt with.
- How?
- She got took to the hospital.
I imagine... he ended up there, too.
Not the sort of behaviour Arthur...tolerated.
Do you remember her name?
No, just... some tart who did casual bar work.
What about him?
HE SNORTS
They all look the same to me, those boys.
Young...dumb... and full of come.
Just like her.

This is her.
I PNC-checked everyone on the Level Nine payroll.
Kelly Paterson.
Occasional barmaid.
In 2005, she'd have been 19 years old, plus...
Convictions for soliciting.

Is it even possible to walk out of a life and never look back?
You know, Freya, people come to Witness Protection for different reasons.
Some are just unlucky.
They look out of the wrong window at the wrong time and they see something they can't unsee, but... for someone like Michael, it was the only way out of a life he... he no longer wanted.
Look, I know you have questions, but you have to understand that, even if I know the answers, I may not be able to share them.
Look, I have got you something that I can share.
Michael wanted to come clean to you about who he was, the things he did before he met you.
He knew that it might mean losing you, but he wanted to do it anyway.
He said there was no future without honesty.

I mean, when I'm working nights, I barely see her.
I'm a nurse.
And what about Kelly?
- What does she do?
- Bar work.
But she's between jobs at the moment.
You know, there was one thing.
She was packing stuff into a bag before she left.
I'm pretty sure I saw her passport.
OK.
See, if you see her, or if she calls... ..could you ask her to call me on that number?
And will you please tell her that she's not in any trouble?
I just want to talk to her, OK?
OK.
'I'm sorry I missed your call.
Everything OK?
'
Listen, a body's just been brought in by a fishing boat.
'Sandy's ID'd him as the guy from Scalloway.'
- What, the gunman?
- 'Billy's informing the relevant authorities,' but I figure we should keep a blackout on this till we have a name, if only for Freya Galdie's sake.
We're transferring him to the Mainland now for postmortem.
That's if he doesn't burst before they get him into the car.
Speak to you later.
What?
!
He's a man paid to do other people's violence!
I'm supposed to feel sentimental about his carcass?
!
In Shetland, you called me an expensive errand boy.
Well, that's not all I am.
And some of the things I am are sitting less easily with me than they used to.
- Why, what's changed?
- Arthur McCall has changed.
He was always motivated by one thing and one thing only - greed.
Whatever he did was done in the pursuit of profit.
There was a rationale to that.
A logic.
Not any more.
Why?
What's different?
There's a generation coming up behind him.
A new breed.
Perhaps he can feel his power waning or... maybe it's less emotional and more neurological.
I'm sure I could get medical testimony to that effect the next time he's in court.
Either way, he's not a safe person to know any more.
You telling me you're scared?
I'm telling you, he is no longer a client I want to represent.
Neither is he a client I can afford to offend.
So, you're saying that, if he was to end up going to prison... ..then that would solve your problems?
OK, then give me something that'll help.
I heard what happened to your colleague.
I'm sorry.
You're trying to find a match for the perpetrator's DNA.
You won't.
No, that doesn't makes sense.
He wasn't clean.
- He knew what he was about.
He's got a history...
- Hold that thought.
Work with it.

Eddie Kerr's missus was just on the phone.
Says he had a job up north.
Due home a couple of days ago.
Hasn't shown up.
She seems to think you might know something about it.
Eddie Kerr?
I haven't seen him in months.
Jimmy!
- I'm glad you came by.
I was just gonnae call you there.
- Uh-huh?
Boyd!
The DNA results are back.
Not a match for anybody on the database.
We're still waiting on the prints, though.
Aye, well, they'll be the same, because this guy's not on our...
Tommy, does Arthur McCall have connections outside of Scotland?
Oh, aye.
Holland, Estonia, Bulgaria.
Aye.
Tosh didn't mention the guy having any kind of accent, though.
Could be one of ours who's been abroad for a while.
They use them in one country and keep them clean in another.
What, a foreign exchange programme?
You ask the Bulgarian police!

Hello?
Hi, er...
I-I wondered if I could still take you up on that drink?
- 'If, if you haven't changed your mind.'
- No.
No, I haven't changed MY mind.
'I've got something to do in the office, 'but I could probably be over at your hotel in about an hour?
'
OK, I'll, er...
I'll see you then.
Hey, Tosh?
Listen, could I ask you a question?
Yeah.
HE CLEARS HIS THROAT
The DNA that we got from your things in Level Nine... ..is the same as the DNA they got in the SARC at Sandyford.
Now, it didn't match anything on our records, but it showed up on a database in Eastern Europe.
A couple of violent crimes.
Both of them are still unsolved.
So, would you be OK to look at some photographs of potential suspects?
No.
No.

Mm-mm.

No.

No.

Sorry.
It's OK.
Right, so...
How did you end up in Scotland?
I came to university in Glasgow, met someone and then stayed.
Yeah, my daughter's working on a variation of that.
Hers involves following the guy to Brazil.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
How about you?
Why Shetland?
Well, I'm from Fair Isle.
So, for me, it was just a matter of coming home, really.
- After your wife died?
- Uh-huh.
Fair Isle.
Isn't that, like, where there's a million sheep and no people?
THEY LAUGH
- There's...there's 70 people.
- Ah.
- And some sheep.
There's a lot of birds.
And it's very beautiful.
There's actually...
It's about 20 miles that way.
You can see it when it's clear.
Listen, um, I'm sorry about the way I was earlier.
I've been doing this job for a long time now and... some things get harder to live with.
But it wasn't your fault.
Look, what I said to Freya, when I told Freya, er, I...really didn't think what that would mean for you.
So, I'M sorry.
Well, I'm not your responsibility.
You...
You know you did the right thing by asking me to come and that's all that matters.
Well, how'd it go?
Yeah, OK.
I-I think she felt better.
- And what about you?
- Oh...
Why'd you leave me in Glasgow?
Mmm?
I just woke up and you were gone.
Well, I didn't want to outstay my welcome.
Really?
SHE LAUGHS
Yeah, well...
I'm the one with the room this time.
So, you can stay as long as you like.

You were back early last night.
Ahem, only my sources told me that you were in the bar at the Lighthouse Hotel with what looked to them very much like a date.
I thought you'd be staying out.
Or maybe bringing home a little company.
Oh, Jesus Christ, man!
Once in a while, throw me a bone, eh?
What is it, Duncan?
!
What is it that you want to know?
I just want to know you're all right.

How're you doing?
All right.
Mainly.
We'll get them.
Kidnap and false imprisonment?
They're looking at years.
But so am I, though, aren't I?
I know justice is what everyone wants.
But I don't want to be stuck where I am now.
And, if it went to trial, I would be.
Like you said... ..years.
It's not about what everyone else wants, though, is it?
It's about what you need.
What if he does it again?
Tosh, you are not answerable for what he does.
He is.
He's your attacker.
He's not your responsibility.
I'm around, you know, if you want to talk.
Thank you.
TELEPHONES RING
You've just had another delivery.
This one looks more promising than flowers.
So, this thing at work you cannae tell me about, did you at least tell Asha that's why you were passing up her invitation?
No.
Look, I-I...
I didn't want to make excuses, so I just told her it wisnae a good time.
Jimmy, if you don't tell her, she's going to jump to the obvious conclusion.
What's the obvious conclusion?
Oh...
Dear God!
James...
I can guarantee you, that at this moment in time, she's thinking she got turned down because either you're not attracted to her, or because you're not ready to move on from the dead wife.
Seriously?
My guess is, she's thinking it's the dead wife.
Christ, I thought it was Fran until you told me otherwise.
Look, I...
I know I'm not in a position to lecture, but there are some things it's just better to come clean about.
CAR APPROACHES
Who do you think you are, sending me presents?
Sending me pictures?
Who do you think you are to draw me?
You don't know me!
- I...
- I don't want you to draw me!
I don't want you to look at me.
I never said you could do that.
Erm, there's, er... a seat you can... you can sit.
CRASHING, GLASS SMASHES
Asha?
Can I talk to you for a second?
Er...yeah, sure.
Come here.
Look, something, something happened.
Very recently at work and it's not my story, I'm just a... bystander.
But it's...
It's about how men are with women and I've been struggling with it.
I'm struggling with it.
And I don't want it to intrude.
And so, that's what last night was about and not about anything else.
And...
And not you...and really, really not about you.
I'm sorry I didn't say anything but I've got so used to not sharing things.
I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry.
Will I see you soon?
I'll call you.
OK.
Kelly.
God, how can you stand it?
You know what I mean?
There's nothing to focus on.
It's just horizon.
There's been a rumour about a guy shot in Shetland...
Mick Thompson.
Is that the murder you're investigating?
Yes, It's one of them.
And the only other person I've heard refer to him as Mick...is a man called Arthur McCall.
That's, um...tea.
And, um...
I'll be in there.
I'd seen him around but I didn't know him.
He was in this big group.
He was good-looking, you know?
It was Burns Night, I wasn't working, I was just ...
I was just out to please myself.
We started messing about and we ended up outside, round the back.
But he was flying on something and he started to get rough, so I said I wanted to stop, that I wanted go back inside.
And he...
He did what he did.
He raped you.
You went to the police but then you decided to drop the charges...
Why?
A couple of guys from the club came to the station.
Mick, you know, and another guy, Calvin.
They said Arthur didn't want to give the cops an excuse to poke around.
They said they'd look after me and they'd take care of the guy that did it.
I was a user.
I had a history of selling sex.
My injuries could have come from a violent punter.
I mean, the cop's weren't going to take it anywhere, anyway.
Well, then, why go to them in the first place?
Kelly?
I didn't have many choices back then.
Needle or smoke.
Tea or coffee.
Who I said, "no" to.
I said "no" to him and he broke my bones and he hurt me.
What about Michael Thompson?
He was good to me.
Not just then but... for a long time after.
He looked out for me.
And he treated me the way he thought I should treat myself.
With consideration.
And I do now.
I just wish I'd been able to show him that.
Can you remember the names of any of the police officers that you spoke to?
And the name of the man who assaulted you?
He was a student.
They called him "BB".
You know, like the air gun.
Those were his initials.
Ben Brennan.
Yeah.
They should only take me a couple of hours to sort out.
Thanks, Billy, you're a life-saver.
Aye, that's me!
- Rhona?
- Yeah?
Phyllis's son.
Ben?
- Yes.
Did he go to university in Glasgow?
- Yeah.
Why?
Just... trying to figure something out.
So, Phyllis Brenan's son... ..and Arthur McCall...
..makes it go away.
That's big.
That's bigger than just Arthur McCall.
- So, what does Arthur ask for in return?
- Everything.
I mean, ten years on and he's still a free man, isn't he?
OK.
Then we should get the paperwork on McCall and we should...
What?
I don't know.
Kelly.
I mean, do you ever think what it must be like to have something like that happen to you and for there to be no redress?
Mm...
Things have changed since then.
We'd handle it different now.
Right, so you think that if Kelly was to walk in here tomorrow with the same story, that we'd get a conviction?
And that she wouldnae be asked on the stand what she was wearing and how many sexual partners she'd had?
We should be doing better by them.
TAPPING
Is she around?
- No, she's gone for the day.
I could call her...
- No.
Billy, I'm moving out of my flat for a bit.
I'm going to be staying with my friends Beth and Roz for a while.
I'll give you the details.
The thing is...
It wasn't just the car..
..and the hood over my head in Glasgow.
There was more.
You know?
You know.
Could you please tell Sandy for me?
I want him to know...
Aye, aye, I'll tell him.
I would like to give you a hug.
Would that be allowed?
Sorry.
Hey, lady, you call the shots round here.
Night.
No...
No, this doesn't make sense.
It's just that there is not enough.
But McCall has dodged prison again and again!
Yeah, because he's got a good lawyer.
If Michael Thompson hadn't been shot,
McCall was looking at life in prison.
Every time that he's investigated, he suffers, his business suffers.
Think about it.
If you had a Senior Fiscal in your pocket, then wouldn't you expect better protection than this?
'What if it's not McCall 'who's been benefitting from Phyllis Brenan's protection?
'But if not McCall... '..then who?
When did she pass away?
It's been eleven months now.
That's gotta be hard.
What I should do is I should just stay here with you.
I'd love that.
Well, I'd be happy.
You got lazy and lost XHP.
I got this.
You know, I'd really like to think I was right considering you for Managing Partner.
Learn this guy's face.
He's the devil.
My client is suing the shit out of his client.
Speak of the devil...
Did you two come together?
Ah.
He's signing but he wants Erin to head it.
Want to get a beer?
You tell me your goals.
Hello?
Uh, you're breaking up a little bit.
Is this a uh, secure line?
It is.
Sorry, I just have really bad reception.
I asked how you got my number?
I got your number from Kevin Young.
Okay.
Listen...
There's one more thing,
I'm travelling with my wife.
I understand.
Do you?
I do.
Is it okay if I call you back Tuesday and we can confirm and sort out the details?
Of course.
I'll speak to you soon.
Great.
Thank you.
Bye.
Sounds like business is going good.
Yeah, it's fine.
That's good.
To be honest, I'd rather spend all my time with you.
Oh, yeah?
Just as long as you know I don't expect that from you.
You know that, right?
- I know.
- Okay.
Just being honest.
Okay.
What we should do, you and I, is sit down, and figure out an arrangement and make that happen.
Yeah, that'd be amazing.
I'd love that.
Me, too.
Ah, thought you'd forgotten me.
- Now, you want something?
- No, thank you.
Cheers.
Is there any way we could be alone?
A bottle of vodka, get some popcorn...
Maybe get two bottles of vodka.
Oh, and the girl wants, she wants canned tuna, so see if you can find some of that uh, dolphin-safe stuff, any organic, you know what to look for right?
Okay.
Dolphin-safe, that's the way to go.
Michael!
Michael!
Michael?
Michael!
Michael!
It's great, huh?
What's the matter?
Peter Gramercy.
Hi, this is Chelsea Rayne.
I got your message, just calling you back.
Yes.
I represent the estate of Michael Cilic.
The estate?
He passed away last Thursday evening.
Cardiac arrest.
My condolences.
He named you as a beneficiary in his will.
I was hoping you could come by my office, so that we could go over the details.
Sam?
Are you Chelsea?
This is Shannon.
Hi...
Chelsea.
Excuse me.
Yes, sir?
You serve a 18-year-old scotch with ice that looks like it came from a soda fountain?
Could I have a more substantial block of ice back there?
I'll check, sir.
Yes, please check.
And if you don't have the proper ice, just leave it neat.
Right away.
So, how'd you guys meet?
Do you want to...?
No, go ahead.
Uh, a mutual friend's birthday party.
It was pretty funny.
I uh...
I didn't like him at all.
I
- I thought he was really conceited.
He wouldn't talk to me.
I must have asked him about a hundred questions, and he just- he wouldn't say anything.
Turns out he's just shy.
I'm not shy.
Yes, you are.
No, I am not.
Yes, you are.
Okay.
That's enough.
Well, it seems like you guys have a lot of fun together.
You guys wanna do some shots?
It's a $12,000 watch.
Makes phone calls, never lost a second.
She is $3,000.
Where the fuck is she?
- I know.
- Yeah.
- I mean what am I paying her for exactly?
- I don't know.
I guess to leave.
No, don't talk about money.
Sweetie, why don't we call you a cab?
No, no.
I'm fine.
Oh honey, can you...?
Should we go over here?
This damn rug!
No.
Are you okay?
I'm so sorry, I never do this.
It's okay.
Three thousand fucking dollars.
Do you need to use the bathroom again?
Let's just get her clothes back on.
Hello.
Are you sleeping?
Harder.
Harder.
What's going on with you?
Nothing.
Did you cum?
Yeah, did you?
No.
I'm...
Are you stressed out?
No.
I promised I'd take my kids to school.
You can just tell me to leave.
I'm not your friend.
Maybe I can be... at some point.
But not at four o'clock in the morning.
Feel free to crash here.
Take a shower.
Whatever.
I gotta go.
David?
David, is that you?
I'll be out in a second.
Christine, hi.
Erin.
I thought I heard someone.
You're here early.
Yeah, I just wanted to get here before the day starts getting crazy.
Get some work done.
Is that something I can help you with?
No, just... getting familiar with David's work, going through my own process.
Oh, I'm sure you are.
You want to grab lunch today?
We can talk about your experience at the firm so far.
I have an opening at two.
Yeah, yeah, that'd be great.
I'd love that.
Cool.
I'll see you at two.
But uh, you know, when we find it, we will, so... oh gentleman, I just have to go but you listen...
It's not official, and the committee still needs to make the final vote, but it's clear the way everyone's leaning.
I'm sorry, I'm not clear what you're saying.
They're promoting you to Managing Partner.
Next week.
Goes without saying, don't tell them I told you.
That's...
That's great, that's...
Huh...
I just wanted to give you some lead time so you could get things in order.
What about XHP?
Erin's heading it.
You don't have to worry about that.
Managing Partner is a high-level position.
I've been working with XHP for two years.
I'd like to see it through.
Continue working closely with Erin on it.
If you wanna put in the extra time, go for it.
But you're only getting one salary.
I know.
We'll consider it pro bono work.
- Congratulations.
- Mmm.
You know, I've heard great things about your work.
How's it going with David?
It's great.
I'm really learning a lot.
It's really impressive how much he can juggle.
The Sancerre.
Thanks.
Are we ready to order?
Not quite yet.
Did you know he's going through a divorce?
It must be a trying time for him.
He didn't uh, mention that.
Seventeen years.
Megan...
You met at the party.
He's got two kids, Chris and Kyle.
Sixteen and fourteen.
I shouldn't bring it up.
I just thought you should know, in case it changes his behavior at work.
Sometimes he doesn't think before he acts.
But...
You work with him.
You're smart.
I'm sure you've noticed that.
Yeah, I mean he- he definitely knows what he wants.
Yeah.
"He knows what he wants."
Thank you for being honest with me though.
Anytime.
So thorough.
You're leading this now.
You got me into this.
Into XHP's pants?
- Mmm...
- His name is Emery.
Well, the names change, you're just using the tools at your disposal.
How's Christine?
Nice deflection tactic.
As your intern?
That's not what you were asking.
I don't need your help.
Yes, you do.
No, I don't.
If anything, I can focus better without you in my fucking face, making snarky comments.
They're promoting me.
To Managing Partner?
No, to Head of Maintenance.
Yeah, Managing Partner.
Sorry.
That was shitty.
I just wanted to let you know before they did.
I asked to stay on XHP with you.
Thanks for the consolation prize.
I know.
You deserved it.
No, I didn't.
Have a seat.
You live in the city?
Yes.
Okay.
Well...
Michael amended his will two months ago.
I'm sure you understand this sets off alarm bells within his family.
I'm sure this is very hard for them.
$500,000 was left in the name of Chelsea Rayne.
Are you Chelsea Rayne?
All Michael left was your telephone number.
He said you two had become very close.
We were very close.
You'll need more than a telephone number to prove your identity to the Probate Court.
Do you have an attorney?
We saw each other once or twice a week for the past four-and-a-half, five months.
He was always generous, but I did not expect this.
I'm sorry, I don't have any other lawyers that I trust that I can talk to about this.
Mmm, admittedly, I was looking forward to a nice lunch and a little bit of...
You know.
I didn't know this was gonna be a business lunch.
Okay, how many um,
"clients" or...
"men" do you see?
Is that necessary?
So I'm gonna help you, but you gotta be straight with me.
Come on.
A few, including you.
- Does your family know?
- No.
If you decide you want this inheritance, and uh, you're willing to prove that you're Chelsea, it becomes public record.
Anyone has access to the will once it goes through Probate.
I'm gonna have to think about that.
Well, take some time.
Can I ask you another question?
Go ahead.
Ask away.
Why would two lawyers from opposing teams share information?
Unless the judge ordered it, they would have no reason to.
That's illegal.
- That's-that's collusion.
- Right.
What kind of case is this?
Medical patent.
What's it worth?
Billions?
There you go.
There's a whole host of reasons right there.
You sure that's what's going on?
No.
No, I can't be certain.
Now, I got a question for you.
This, me and you, now.
This is business, right?
It's always been business.
You've been re-assigned to Skip Hadderly.
Why?
I don't know.
Talk to Evans?
David didn't say.
He must have said something.
He must have given a reason why.
No, he didn't.
He doesn't have to.
He just said he wants a new intern.
Skip's great, you'll like him.
Just let it go.
I don't think this will take that long, will it?
Well, I cancelled the coffee,
I doubt we'll be done before it gets here.
You boys take it easy on me, alright?
Before we make our final decision, we'd just like to hear from you, how you see our firm moving forward.
Think of it as a... conversation.
Right.
Casual conversation across from five men staring at me.
Look...
You know me.
I'm not an idealist.
We need to move in directions which may not feel right.
The market is changing at a rate that is exponential our current resources.
I want to see you.
I'm sorry, we can't keep doing this.
I know.
Just one more time?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
Yeah, she is.
Mmm-hmm.
Just a second.
She's just an intern.
There's nothing to worry about.
I checked everything.
It's not going to trial, I got it.
I will make sure that it is not going to trial.
Yeah.
Our deal still stands.
Yeah.
Checks go to Quorta.
Still the same.
Alright, I gotta go.
Sorry, I had to go to the bathroom.
Who was that?
That?
That was Ben.
You met him.
He and I...
- We used to know each other...
- From college.
Yeah.
Ben Holgrem, I met him in your office.
His client's suing the shit out of our client.
You know.
You're still in school?
You'll get it, when your friends start working for different sides.
I don't have any friends.
Are you waiting for me to fuck you?
Yeah.
And if I don't?
Then I'll have to fire you.
Your skin.
It feels so good, I want to pass out.
Oh, man.
Hey...
We're really happy to have you on board.
I'm just gonna have you read a few articles of the work I'm doing so-so you can get up to speed.
- Okay?
- Great.
And Sara, could you- could you get our copy of the Eisner application?
And listen, if you need anything at all, door's always open, okay?
Great.
Thanks, Skip.
- Thank you.
- Yeah.
- Don't be fancy.
- Okay.
I promise I won't make it more complicated than it has to be.
Just cut and paste.
Real easy.
Okay, great.
Are you waiting for me to fuck you?
Yeah.
And if I don't?
Then I'll have to fire you.
It's not going to trial, I got it.
I will make sure it is not going to trial.
Our deal still stands.
Checks go to Quorta.
When did she pass away?
It's been eleven months now.
That's gotta be hard.

I promise I won't make it more complicated than it has to be.
Just cut and paste.
Real easy.
Okay, great.

Are you waiting for me to fuck you?
Yeah.
And if I don't?
Then I'll have to fire you.
(SOUND OF REWINDING)
It's not going to trial, I got it.
I will make sure it is not going to trial.
Our deal still stands.
Checks go to Quorta.
When did she pass away?
It's been eleven months now.
That's gotta be hard.
What I should do is I should just stay here with you.
I'd love that.
Well, I'd be happy.
You got lazy and lost XHP.
I got this.
You know, I'd really like to think I was right considering you for Managing Partner.
Learn this guy's face.
He's the devil.
My client is suing the shit out of his client.
Speak of the devil...
Did you two come together?
Ah.
He's signing but he wants Erin to head it.
Want to get a beer?
You tell me your goals.
Hello?
Uh, you're breaking up a little bit.
Is this a uh, secure line?
It is.
Sorry, I just have really bad reception.
I asked how you got my number?
I got your number from Kevin Young.
Okay.
Listen...
There's one more thing,
I'm travelling with my wife.
I understand.
Do you?
I do.
Is it okay if I call you back Tuesday and we can confirm and sort out the details?
Of course.
I'll speak to you soon.
Great.
Thank you.
Bye.
Sounds like business is going good.
Yeah, it's fine.
That's good.
To be honest, I'd rather spend all my time with you.
Oh, yeah?
Just as long as you know I don't expect that from you.
You know that, right?
- I know.
- Okay.
Just being honest.
Okay.
What we should do, you and I, is sit down, and figure out an arrangement and make that happen.
Yeah, that'd be amazing.
I'd love that.
Me, too.
Ah, thought you'd forgotten me.
- Now, you want something?
- No, thank you.
Cheers.
Is there any way we could be alone?
A bottle of vodka, get some popcorn...
Maybe get two bottles of vodka.
Oh, and the girl wants, she wants canned tuna, so see if you can find some of that uh, dolphin-safe stuff, any organic, you know what to look for right?
Okay.
Dolphin-safe, that's the way to go.
Michael!
Michael!
Michael?
Michael!
Michael!
It's great, huh?
What's the matter?
Peter Gramercy.
Hi, this is Chelsea Rayne.
I got your message, just calling you back.
Yes.
I represent the estate of Michael Cilic.
The estate?
He passed away last Thursday evening.
Cardiac arrest.
My condolences.
He named you as a beneficiary in his will.
I was hoping you could come by my office, so that we could go over the details.
Sam?
Are you Chelsea?
This is Shannon.
Hi...
Chelsea.
Excuse me.
Yes, sir?
You serve a 18-year-old scotch with ice that looks like it came from a soda fountain?
Could I have a more substantial block of ice back there?
I'll check, sir.
Yes, please check.
And if you don't have the proper ice, just leave it neat.
Right away.
So, how'd you guys meet?
Do you want to...?
No, go ahead.
Uh, a mutual friend's birthday party.
It was pretty funny.
I uh...
I didn't like him at all.
I-I thought he was really conceited.
He wouldn't talk to me.
I must have asked him about a hundred questions, and he just-he wouldn't say anything.
Turns out he's just shy.
I'm not shy.
Yes, you are.
No, I am not.
Yes, you are.
Okay.
That's enough.
Well, it seems like you guys have a lot of fun together.
You guys wanna do some shots?
It's a $12,000 watch.
Makes phone calls, never lost a second.
She is $3,000.
Where the fuck is she?
- I know.
- Yeah.
- I mean what am I paying her for exactly?
- I don't know.
I guess to leave.
No, don't talk about money.
Sweetie, why don't we call you a cab?
No, no.
I'm fine.
Oh honey, can you...?
Should we go over here?
This damn rug!
No.
Are you okay?
I'm so sorry, I never do this.
It's okay.
Three thousand fucking dollars.
Do you need to use the bathroom again?
Let's just get her clothes back on.
Hello.
Are you sleeping?
Harder.
Harder.
What's going on with you?
Nothing.
Did you cum?
Yeah, did you?
No.
I'm...
Are you stressed out?
No.
I promised I'd take my kids to school.
You can just tell me to leave.
I'm not your friend.
Maybe I can be... at some point.
But not at four o'clock in the morning.
Feel free to crash here.
Take a shower.
Whatever.
I gotta go.
David?
David, is that you?
I'll be out in a second.
Christine, hi.
Erin.
I thought I heard someone.
You're here early.
Yeah, I just wanted to get here before the day starts getting crazy.
Get some work done.
Is that something I can help you with?
No, just... getting familiar with David's work, going through my own process.
Oh, I'm sure you are.
You want to grab lunch today?
We can talk about your experience at the firm so far.
I have an opening at two.
Yeah, yeah, that'd be great.
I'd love that.
Cool.
I'll see you at two.
But uh, you know, when we find it, we will, so... oh gentleman, I just have to go but you listen...
It's not official, and the committee still needs to make the final vote, but it's clear the way everyone's leaning.
I'm sorry, I'm not clear what you're saying.
They're promoting you to Managing Partner.
Next week.
Goes without saying, don't tell them I told you.
That's...
That's great, that's...
Huh...
I just wanted to give you some lead time so you could get things in order.
What about XHP?
Erin's heading it.
You don't have to worry about that.
Managing Partner is a high-level position.
I've been working with XHP for two years.
I'd like to see it through.
Continue working closely with Erin on it.
If you wanna put in the extra time, go for it.
But you're only getting one salary.
I know.
We'll consider it pro bono work.
- Congratulations.
- Mmm.
You know, I've heard great things about your work.
How's it going with David?
It's great.
I'm really learning a lot.
It's really impressive how much he can juggle.
The Sancerre.
Thanks.
Are we ready to order?
Not quite yet.
Did you know he's going through a divorce?
It must be a trying time for him.
He didn't uh, mention that.
Seventeen years.
Megan...
You met at the party.
He's got two kids, Chris and Kyle.
Sixteen and fourteen.
I shouldn't bring it up.
I just thought you should know, in case it changes his behavior at work.
Sometimes he doesn't think before he acts.
But...
You work with him.
You're smart.
I'm sure you've noticed that.
Yeah, I mean he-he definitely knows what he wants.
Yeah.
That's a great way to put it:
"He knows what he wants."
Thank you for being honest with me though.
Anytime.
So thorough.
You're leading this now.
You got me into this.
Into XHP's pants?
- Mmm...
- His name is Emery.
Well, the names change, you're just using the tools at your disposal.
How's Christine?
Nice deflection tactic.
As your intern?
That's not what you were asking.
I don't need your help.
Yes, you do.
No, I don't.
If anything, I can focus better without you in my fucking face, making snarky comments.
They're promoting me.
To Managing Partner?
No, to Head of Maintenance.
Yeah, Managing Partner.
Sorry.
That was shitty.
I just wanted to let you know before they did.
I asked to stay on XHP with you.
Thanks for the consolation prize.
I know.
You deserved it.
No, I didn't.
Have a seat.
You live in the city?
Yes.
Okay.
Well...
Michael amended his will two months ago.
I'm sure you understand this sets off alarm bells within his family.
I'm sure this is very hard for them.
$500,000 was left in the name of Chelsea Rayne.
Are you Chelsea Rayne?
All Michael left was your telephone number.
He said you two had become very close.
We were very close.
You'll need more than a telephone number to prove your identity to the Probate Court.
Do you have an attorney?
We saw each other once or twice a week for the past four-and-a-half, five months.
He was always generous, but I did not expect this.
I'm sorry, I don't have any other lawyers that I trust that I can talk to about this.
Mmm, admittedly, I was looking forward to a nice lunch and a little bit of...
You know.
I didn't know this was gonna be a business lunch.
Okay, how many um,
"clients" or...
"men" do you see?
Is that necessary?
So I'm gonna help you, but you gotta be straight with me.
Come on.
A few, including you.
- Does your family know?
- No.
If you decide you want this inheritance, and uh, you're willing to prove that you're Chelsea, it becomes public record.
Anyone has access to the will once it goes through Probate.
I'm gonna have to think about that.
Well, take some time.
Can I ask you another question?
Go ahead.
Ask away.
Why would two lawyers from opposing teams share information?
Unless the judge ordered it, they would have no reason to.
That's illegal.
- That's-that's collusion.
- Right.
What kind of case is this?
Medical patent.
What's it worth?
Billions?
There you go.
There's a whole host of reasons right there.
You sure that's what's going on?
No.
No, I can't be certain.
Now, I got a question for you.
This, me and you, now.
This is business, right?
It's always been business.
You've been re-assigned to Skip Hadderly.
Why?
I don't know.
Talk to Evans?
David didn't say.
He must have said something.
He must have given a reason why.
No, he didn't.
He doesn't have to.
He just said he wants a new intern.
Skip's great, you'll like him.
Just let it go.
I don't think this will take that long, will it?
Well, I cancelled the coffee,
I doubt we'll be done before it gets here.
You boys take it easy on me, alright?
Before we make our final decision, we'd just like to hear from you, how you see our firm moving forward.
Think of it as a... conversation.
Right.
Casual conversation across from five men staring at me.
Look...
You know me.
I'm not an idealist.
We need to move in directions which may not feel right.
The market is changing at a rate that is exponential our current resources.
I want to see you.
I'm sorry, we can't keep doing this.
I know.
Just one more time?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
Yeah, she is.
Mmm-hmm.
Just a second.
She's just an intern.
There's nothing to worry about.
I checked everything.
It's not going to trial, I got it.
I will make sure that it is not going to trial.
Yeah.
Our deal still stands.
Yeah.
Checks go to Quorta.
Still the same.
Alright, I gotta go.
Sorry, I had to go to the bathroom.
Who was that?
That?
That was Ben.
You met him.
He and I...
- We used to know each other...
- From college.
Yeah.
Ben Holgrem, I met him in your office.
His client's suing the shit out of our client.
You know.
You're still in school?
You'll get it, when your friends start working for different sides.
I don't have any friends.
Are you waiting for me to fuck you?
Yeah.
And if I don't?
Then I'll have to fire you.
Your skin.
It feels so good, I want to pass out.
Oh, man.
Hey...
We're really happy to have you on board.
I'm just gonna have you read a few articles of the work I'm doing so-so you can get up to speed.
- Okay?
- Great.
And Sara, could you-could you get our copy of the Eisner application?
And listen, if you need anything at all, door's always open, okay?
Great.
Thanks, Skip.
- Thank you.
- Yeah.
- Don't be fancy.
- Okay.
I promise I won't make it more complicated than it has to be.
Just cut and paste.
Real easy.
Okay, great.
Are you waiting for me to fuck you?
Yeah.
And if I don't?
Then I'll have to fire you.
It's not going to trial, I got it.
I will make sure it is not going to trial.
Our deal still stands.
Checks go to Quorta.
Good afternoon, ma'am.
We've received a number of noise complaints regarding this address.
Is everything okay?
Your husband home?
Ma'am, please step aside.
We're going to have to come in.
Ma'am, we won't ask you again.
Open the door and step aside now.
Go away.
Go away.
Please go away.
Go away.
Hey.
You okay?
You need to leave.
You're going to make them angry.
Who?
What the hell was that?
What's she saying?
She says this place is... haunted.
Get her out of here!
Now!
Please stop.
Don't hurt him.
Please don't.
Please don't hurt him.
All right.
Well, I'm gonna go ahead and say that none of that actually happened.
I will have you know that my old man got the story directly from the desk sergeant who was working that night.
And it was in the papers the next day, so...
Oh, it was in the papers in 1940.
Uh-huh.
Then it must be true.
Right?
Yeah.
I see what you're trying to do, and it's not... it's not gonna work.
What am I trying to do?
Well, uh, we are, uh, walking up to this spooky house.
It's Halloween.
And, uh, you are telling me this ghost story that you probably stole from Tales from the Crypt or Haunted Lives or something like that.
And it is your attempt, your weak attempt, to try and frighten me, which...
It's not gonna work, 'cause I don't frighten easily.
Hey, I'm just telling you the story, all right?
Hey!
Max!
Max!
Back in the building.
What's up, babe?
How was the sabbatical, buddy?
Well, not to oversell it-- it was, without a doubt, the single greatest experience of my lifetime.
Working with the Twa people in Burundi, it forever altered my perspective on my career, my role in the world, and what it means to be human.
Well, that's fantastic.
That's awesome.
And I like...
You got the beard.
It looks nice.
I love it!
Nice new style.
Look at the long hair.
Actually, this facial hair is part of my Halloween costume.
I'm playing the titular character of the film John Wick, which is my latest tribute to the film legacy of...
Keanu Reeves.
I've seen this one, and I-I like the attention to detail, with the wedding ring and everything.
You are correct in noting that this wedding ring was worn by the character John Wick even after the untimely passing of his wife.
However, I'm wearing it because I married Sabrina.
Excuse me?
Way to bury the lead, Max.
Mazel tov, buddy.
That's, uh... that's fantastic.
Congratulations, Max.
That's awesome.
Hey, Chin, guess what.
Max and Sabrina tied the knot.
What?
That's great news!
Hey.
Ho'omaika'i 'Ana, Max.
Mahalo.
Uh, I want to hear all about it.
Right now we got work to do.
Uh, body's this way.
64 years old.
And before she retired, she made a name for herself as a TV medium.
Oh, of course.
I remember all the late-night ads for her psychic hotline.
I guess it makes sense that someone like her would choose to live in a house with this kind of a history, huh?
What history?
Uh, 1940 haunting.
Everybody on the island knows about the well-documented paranormal incident.
Everybody except for Detective Williams.
Let's just stick to reality, like what actually happened on Earth in this house tonight.
We're still trying to make sense of the scene, but, so far, it looks like a home invasion.
Now, our victim called 911 early in the evening to report an intruder.
But by the time HPD got here, she was already dead.
And the weird part is, the alarm was still armed and there's no signs of forced entry.
Okay, well, do we have any idea how the intruder got in and out of the house?
Dispatch just sent me a recording of the 911 call.
You got to hear this.
911, what's your location and emergency?
It's back.
It's in my house.
Ma'am, are you saying there's someone inside your home?
Yes.
Yes.
Yes, it's... it's come for me.
It's come.
Okay, I need you to get to a safe place and lock the door.
Oh, my God!
"It's back," huh?
Yeah.
If I got an intruder in my house,
I'm saying "he" or "she"" I'm not calling it "it""
This is peculiar.
What is it, Max?
Well, uh, well, this is just my preliminary observation.
I would have to do a full autopsy in order to give a definitive analysis.
To me, it seems that she died of a sudden and catastrophic cardiac arrest.
So nobody laid a finger on her?
No.
I-In fact, based on the disturbing phone call and the fact that her pupils are dilated, I would say that C.O.D. was the result of overwhelming emotional stress.
Max, what are you saying, exactly?
Well, what I'm trying to say is that, whatever it is that she saw, it literally scared her to death.

It's bad enough I'm grounded on Halloween.
Why do I need a babysitter?
I'm 14.
Okay, listen to me, if you will recall, last year, you deliberately, deliberately disobeyed your parents and you snuck off to a party, okay?
So, this year you, uh, you serve your sentence.
The babysitter's just there to make sure you do your time, okay?
So, I'm under house arrest?
No, you're not under house arrest.
You are free to go trick-or-treating with your little brother.
This is cruel and unusual punishment.
Well, don't do the crime if you can't do the time.
All right?
Doorbell.
Sounds like the babysitter's there.
I love you.
I got to go.
Okay?
Have fun.
Can you help me?
I seem to have lost my head.
Charlie, Jerry's here!
That's right.
And I got big plans for us.
We're gonna make Halloween cookies, carve pumpkins and, of course, go trick-or-treating.
That all sounds so thrilling.
I know, right?
Oh, right.
Sarcasm.
I get it.
Great start, dude.
Uh, Nikki... how long have you been Ms. Webb's assistant?
About, uh, two years now.
At first she just wanted me to organize her personal affairs and... and manage her schedule, but... recently, it became all about keeping her company.
She'd grown terrified of being alone in the house.
Oh.
What, uh, what was she scared of?
Okay, this is gonna sound crazy... but, um... over the past month or so,
Marjorie had become convinced that she was being haunted.
Oh, okay.
By a ghost, naturally.
I know.
I didn't believe it, either, but then I started to see and hear things myself.
What kind of things?
Weird noises.
Items disappearing then turning up somewhere else.
And a few times I heard footsteps when I knew there was no one home but me.
Footsteps.
If it had been one or two isolated incidents
I would have just dismissed it, but... it kept happening.
Trust me, there is something very wrong with this house.
Okay.
All right, well, uh, listen, thank you very for your time.
- Thank you.
- Guys.
Let's take a look at this.
Our Vic upgraded her security over the past two weeks and had a 16-channel camera system installed.
Which is great for us 'cause, trust me, you need to see this to believe it.
Hold on.
I'm gonna cue this up to the 911 call.
Okay.
It's come for me.
It's come.
Oh, my God!
Pretty great we get to spend this time together, huh, Uncle D?
Absolutely.
This place...
I've heard some crazy rumors about this place.
Oh, you mean it's haunted?
It's true, it is.
Wait, what?
I'm just kidding.
Come on.
Not cool, dude.
What's eating him?
Nothing.
He's, uh, he scares easily.
Yeah, who's to blame for that?
What's the matter, Eric?
Did your Uncle Danny do something terrible to you?
No, not really... just psychologically scarred me for life is all.
He has that effect on some people.
Halloween, 1995.
I was ten.
It was the first time I was able to trick-or-treat without my parents.
So, me and some friends decided to dress up as Power Rangers, which was already embarrassing enough 'cause I drew the short straw, had to go as the pink one.
It was all hunky-dory until we were a few houses in, we notice we were being followed by these creeps with masks.
So, we run, they chase us.
It ends up with me getting separated by my fellow Rangers, surrounded by a bunch of maniacs with knives and hatchets.
So, I'm guessing your Uncle Danny was, uh, one of seven maniacs?
That was pretty great.
You should have seen him;
he lost his mind.
Eh.
I also lost control of my bladder.
Took me till high school to shake the name Pee Pee Russo.
You say I'm sadistic.
You're sick.
It was not that bad, okay?
A tougher kid might not have wet his unitard.
His pink unitard.
Eric?
Eric?
Hey, listen...
I need you to tear this place apart, find out how our perp got in and out without tripping the alarms.
All right, I can do it.
I'm on it.
All right.
Hey, uh, you guys, uh, sticking around, right?
Yeah, no one wants you to have another accident.
Don't pay no attention to him, Pee Pee.
Ha!
You guys...
All right, let's, let's put aside the "how" for a minute, and-and focus on the why would somebody want Marjorie Webb dead?
Well, start off with, she's a con artist, she's telling people she got psychic powers, hustling folks out of their hard-earned money.
I would say the suspect pool is very broad.
I'll dig into her financials, maybe I can compile a list.
I just dumped Marjorie's phone.
Over the past couple of weeks, she made over 40 calls to the same number.
Ghostbusters?
Close.
Local priest.
This just keeps gettin' better.
Okay, you're not even gonna ask?
You said it was a surprise, so, no.
I don't get you.
Uh-uh.
See, if it was me, I'd at least be a little bit curious about where we were going.
Then there'd be some questions, some light interrogation.
Kono, I spent the last ten months in nine by 12 cell with a lifer named Nugget, so... when my wife tells me she's taking me on a weekend getaway,
I don't ask questions.
You never told me about Nugget.
Yeah, it's not something I'm ready to talk about.
I'm just kidding.
He's actually a really interesting guy.
Adam!
You okay?
Oh my God, thank you!
What happened?
Back there, we had an accident.
My friend, she's still in the car.
I tried calling 911 but my phone won't work.
Okay, how far?
I don't know.
About half a mile.
All right, get in.
It's this way.
No... no!
No, no, no, no, no.
Your friend, you said she was conscious when you left her?
I think so, but... but she was pinned against the wheel.
How the hell did she get out?
It's blood.
Hurry!
She couldn't have gone far.
You're telling me, buddy?
I gotta live with her.
She turned 14, and all of a sudden she's bipolar.
Moods all over the place.
It's nuts.
On the phone all the time, texting all the time,
I don't know.
Have you considered maybe she's got a boyfriend?
Uh, no.
I had not considered that, Jerry, but now that's all I'll be thinking about, so thank you.
Anyway, I haven't given up on her yet.
If anyone can put Grace in the Halloween spirit, it's good old Uncle Jer.
Hi, Danno!
Hey, buddy.
Is that, uh, is that a knife in his hand, Jerry?
We're carving pumpkins.
Well, to be honest, I'm doing the carving.
His is made of rubber.
Jerry, don't maim my children, okay?
Do my best!
Hey, Cortana!
Play my pumpkin carving mix.
Great.
What are you yelling about?
Look!
Yo...
I must be some kind of criminal mastermind to get pulled out of lockup for a sit-down with Five-O.
Yeah, relax, Godfather.
We're not interested in the little misdemeanor possession charge you got pinched on.
We are, however, very interested in how a low-rent junkie like yourself ends up with a $5,000 check from Marjorie Webb.
You recognize that name, there, genius?
"Nathan Betts."
See, that's you.
She make this check out on the 27th.
You went to a check cashing spot on the 28th and cashed it.
I'm sure your dealer had your money in his hand before lunch.
Yeah, yeah.
You're right about that.
What'd she pay you for, Nathan?
Let's just say, um, I did some landscaping work for her.
Let's just say... you're gonna need to elaborate on that.
And you're gonna have to incentivize me if you want me to talk.
Incentivize you?
Okay!
Well, how's this:
you cooperate, and we'll take you back to county lockup to be arraigned.
Don't, and I'll personally make a call to the U.S. Attorney to make sure you end up in a supermax for a very extended vacation.
How's that for a deal?
Supermax.
All right.
Fair enough.
About a week ago, this, uh, this Marjorie woman approaches me on the street and asks me if I want some work.
Being the enterprising young man that I am, I say sure.
What was the job?
Well, that's where it gets a little freaky.
You see, she hired me to break into a cemetery and dig up a grave.
Whose grave?
Some guy named Eli Jones.
Hold on, so you're saying that the body wasn't in there?
That's right.
And that's not even the weirdest part of it all.
Go on.
See, if I tell you... you ain't gonna believe me.
Well, apparently, Betts wasn't hallucinating after all.
Dana?
Dana!
Dana?
Dana?
I don't get it, why would she come out this way?
She could be disoriented from the crash.
Dana!
Dana!
Still more blood.
Dana?
Over there.
Dana?
Dana?
Dana?
On your knees!
Hands in the air!
Wait.
I...
I can hear him.
Mom?
Dad?
He's still here.
Your son Eli is still alive.
That's amazing!
Isn't that amazing, everyone?
Can you tell us anything else, Marjorie?
Yes.
Ah...
New Orleans.
It-
- It's so clear.
He was there.
Just a few days ago.
So, after this consultation with Marjorie, the Jones family spent a fortune trying to find their son Eli.
Disgusting.
They hired a private detective, they even moved to New Orleans for six months to try and find him.
But two years and tens of thousands of dollars later, they learned that he was already dead.
In fact, he died within 48 hours of first being reported missing.
I guess Marjorie's psychic powers were on the fritz that day.
Her reputation took a pretty big hit after that.
Soon after, she retired.
I mean, what she put that family through... you got to think, man, they had motive.
Yeah, they do.
Except right after they found out, the whole family moved to Canada.
I think we can rule them out as suspects.
Yeah, makes sense.
Who's gonna exhume their own son for a revenge play?
So we're back to square one.
Meaning our prime suspect is still a ghost.
All right, Danny just hit me.
He wants us to meet him at the house.
Okay.
Hello?
Danny?
That's weird.
Oh, hell no.
Yeah, okay, Danny, you can come now out now.
How'd you know it was me?
It was a stab in the dark.
Which is what you're gonna get if you don't get out here right now, how about that?
All right, hold on, watch this.
Eric, hit them with the picture frame.
You know you're destroying evidence, right?
Where are you?
I'm right here, relax.
Come on, I got to show you something.
You spooked me, man.
Look how cool it is.

You might want to start your pumpkin, Charlie and I are almost done.
I'll pass.
Well, Charlie, my man, if you thought that recreating the Williams family in squash plants was the highlight of your night, think again, 'cause now it's time for the main event.
We're talking ninja-level T.O.T., Uncle Jerry style.
What's "T.O.T.?"
Trick-or-treating.
But wandering around aimlessly with a bucket in your hand is for half-assers.
Which is why we're gonna hack Halloween.
First, we target all the houses with the most decorations.
They always have the top-shelf candy.
And second-- and this is gonna seem counterintuitive-- we go late, when they're looking to dump the booty they got left over.
Capisce?
Great.
Sounds pretty lame to me.
Yeah, you know what's lame?
This texting people who aren't in the room, when you could be spending time with your brother who is.
Sorry, did you say something?
You know what, Grace?
I'm tired of your attitude.
Why don't you put down that phone and...
Oh, my God!
You should see your face right now.
Seriously?
We found hidden speakers in the wall, blood packets in the faucets, stage wire on the door and bookcases, all hooked up to remote control triggers.
Check this out, this is the attic, where there's definitely enough room for someone to camp out for a couple few days.
That would explain the sleeping bag.
Okay, so, uh, somebody rigs up this entire house, and then camps out in the attic for days on end.
That seems like a lot of trouble to go through to, uh, convince an old woman that she's being haunted, no?
This guy was good, I mean, he knew the blind spots in the security system, which points of entry were unprotected.
Good news is we did recover fingerprints and DNA.
Hopefully we'll get a hit soon.
Lab finished processing Marjorie's phone-- there was spyware on it.
Oh, somebody was listening in?
Yeah, IP address was traced back to a Charles Michael Triblaine.
Better known by his stage name,
"Triblaine the Great."
And what makes Triblaine so great?
Let's find out.
Now, watch, as I'm about to take a bite out of this quarter, huh?
Mm?
But wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
No one leaves here shortchanged.
Thank you.
- Okay.
- Thank you!
That was pretty great.
A guy like that's definitely got the skills to rig up a haunted house.
Yes, he does.
What are they gonna do to us?
I'm sorry to hear that Marjorie is dead, but why do you think I killed her?
Well, we did our homework.
Uh, we know about your beef with Marjorie.
We also know that you spent the better part of the last decade trying to destroy her career.
In fact, you were so obsessed with making sure the whole world knew she was a fraud, in 2008, you offered her a half-a-million dollars if she could prove her psychic abilities in a controlled setting on live TV.
Is that not correct?
I personally would've liked to have seen that, uh, but, unfortunately for you, she retired, and you lost your chance to expose her.
Right, and that right there, that's... that's kind of what we call motive.
Yeah.
No to mention, that place, that house it was tricked out like a Vegas magic show, and you had the expertise to do that.
Despite what you may think, magicians are the most honest people in the world.
We tell you that we're gonna deceive you, and then we do, for entertainment.
But people like Marjorie Webb, con men, psychics, spoon benders, faith healers, they're dangerous because they convince their audiences what-- that what they do is real.
That they have special powers.
I have spent my life in pursuit of the truth.
And the truth is that Marjorie Webb was a wicked fraud who brought misery to dozens of people by giving them hope where there wasn't any!
So, yes,
I resented that she didn't receive the public exposure and comeuppance that she deserved.
But...
I wanted justice, I didn't want her dead.
Okay.
You do understand that we can't just eliminate you from this investigation just 'cause you-you said you didn't do it, right?
We're gonna need alibis for certain key dates.
It's gonna be a process, you get that, right?
Of course, um...
Possibly, though, I could also... give help in, uh... catching the real murderer?
- Help us?
- Yeah?
How you-how you gonna do that?
Your suspect pool is much bigger than you can imagine.
There were the public cases, but Marjorie was also involved in dozens of private consultations over the years.
I have extensive records detailing all the damage that she has done, which I'm happy to share with you, free of charge.
Huh?
But y-you should also know, though, that there's only a couple of places on the island where you can get some of the, uh... items in the spook house that you described.
Happy to point you in the right direction.
All right.
Looks like I got the size right.
Also, I packed you a backup bucket.
That way you'll have an extra one for the overflow.
All right, Grace, it's go time, let's do this.
Let me guess.
You're going as yourself a year from now?
I like it, very meta.
But I think you'll score more candy if you wear your costume.
I'm not coming.
What?
Why not?
It's bad enough that I'm missing an epic Halloween party with my friends.
There's no way I'm dressing up in some stupid costume, begging for candy.
Give me a sec, buddy.
Do you know why I love Halloween so much?
The chocolate?
Just a guess.
It's because it's the one night of the year when you can dress up, and act like a kid, and no one judges you.
Don't be in such a hurry to grow up.
There'll be plenty of time for parties, but how many chances are you gonna get to go trick-or-treating with that little guy over there?
Come on, sis.
Sorry,
I just can't take you seriously in that costume.
So you're coming?
Still no.
What about Grace?
Sorry, kiddo.
She's not coming.
But we're still gonna have a great time.
Boys' night?
That's right.
What's so funny?
I'm starting to think trouble follows you around,
Mrs. Noshimuri.
Oh, really?
I'm just saying, you know, nothing like this ever happened to me before I met you.
I think I could say the same thing about you.
On the plus side, it's never boring.
Never.
Turtle Bay.
That's where you were taking me?
Hmm.
Yeah, I think I would've preferred that.
Oh, my God.
Adam.
Please, tell me you meant the whole thing with the axe and the chain.
Just say yes.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Let's go.
What's up?
Triblaine's alibi checks out.
He was in Europe for the past six months doing performances.
Yeah, well, that would be one hell of a magic trick if he pulled all this off from a different country.
Yeah, we do have a lead on another suspect.
I was able to trace several of the items recovered from the attic back to a magic store here on the island.
According to the owner, the purchases were made by a local guy named Ian Miller.
Okay.
Let's bring him in.
Well, unfortunately, that won't be possible.
HPD discovered the body after responding to a noise complaint.
COD was a stab wound by stiletto blade to the posterior neck area.
Liver temperature puts the time of death at roughly two hours ago.
Okay... this guy... spooks Marjorie Webb to death and then goes back to his own house where, a few short hours later, he's murdered?
Now this is one hell of a coincidence or somebody else knew about Marjorie's death and wanted to make sure
Ian Miller kept his mouth shut.
Right?
An accomplice.
Makes sense with all the... haunted house trickery that there was two of them.
Well, I may have an answer to that.
I found foreign DNA in the form of a hair on Miller's body.
I ran it through the system and got a hit in a most unexpected place.
The DNA profile was in the archives of old missing persons' cases.
Julie Hillman.
She was registered as missing by her family in May 2010... but reported alive and well some four months later.
Wait a minute, we know her.
Nikki Pressman.
Marjorie's assistant.
This way.
Get them back.
Hi, uh, I'm with Five-O.
I need to use your phone.
It's an emergency.
Uh, of course.
Right this way.
Everything all right?
Will be, as soon as we get the police out here.
It's in the kitchen.
Thank you.
There's no phone.
Ain't no help coming for you.
It's Bobby.
I got them.
My place.
Yeah.
See you soon.
Nice to meet you, Bobby.
Hey.
I'm gonna call HPD.
So, in May of 2010, you,
Julie Hillman, disappeared.
Your parents, they went to the police.
They couldn't get any answers and so, out of desperation, they called Marjorie Webb.
I guess I can understand that.
I would've wanted answers myself.
Any parent who loses a child wants answers.
They want to find their kid, all right?
But Marjorie Webb lied to your parents, didn't she?
She told your parents that you were dead.
They were never gonna see you again.
Now armed with that knowledge, your father went home and he realized he couldn't live with that, so he killed himself.
You know, the saddest part about this story for me is that you were a kid.
You ran away from home.
Kids run away from home.
But as soon as you found out the effect that had on your dad, you went back home and you started plotting your revenge.
Most people would've wanted her dead right away.
I wanted her to suffer the way my family suffered.
The way I suffered.
The way all those other people she hurt suffered.
I wanted her to spend the rest of her days staring at a wall in a mental institution, mumbling to herself about ghosts.
Believe what you want, but the plan was never to kill her.
But you did.
You killed her.
Okay?
And then what happened?
You and your partner, Ian Miller, you're-you're looking at a manslaughter charge you never anticipated.
What happened after that?
Ian must've panicked.
Did he threaten to go to the cops?
I never meant for any of this to happen!
But, you see, it happened.
Y-You stabbed a man in the back of the neck and you killed him.
Now you're looking at a straight-up murder rap, on top of the manslaughter charge.
You know what?
We don't even need a confession.
We got her DNA.
Come on.
Hey, hey, Danny, hold...
just give me a second.
I lost my old man, too.
And there's not a day that goes by I don't think about him, so I understand how this must haunt you, knowing that your running away affected your dad the way it did and if you'd have just gone home, just gone home... your dad would probably still be alive right now.
I can see how blaming Marjorie was easier.
What's going on?
It's Kono.
I can't find the keys.
Okay.
We have a tactical advantage here.
So, we hold them off.
Wait until HPD arrives.
Thing is, this is the only gun and we only have three shells left.
All right, we'll have to improvise.
They're coming!
Dana.
You got to take this, okay?
Anyone comes through that window... okay?
Bobby, open up!
Bobby, open the door.
I'm out.
Kono.
Okay, fall back, down the hall.
Come on, come on, come on.
I got you, I got you.
In here.
Okay, bathroom, come on.
I'm out.
I got two left.
You sure you're okay?
Yeah, yeah, I'm good.
Just, uh...
just a few cuts and bruises, a little psychological trauma... but I'll be fine.
Lou, you find anything?
Plenty.
HPD searched the entire compound.
They found two shallow graves with human remains.
Also found a cache of video tapes dating back three years.
It was you two stumbled upon some kind of death cult.
These psychos had a thing for making their own horror movies every Halloween.
Trick or treat.

And it was in the papers the next day, so...
Oh, it was in the papers in 1940.
Uh-huh.
Then it must be true.
Right?
Yeah.
I see what you're trying to do, and it's not... it's not gonna work.
What am I trying to do?
Well, uh, we are, uh, walking up to this spooky house.
It's Halloween.
And, uh, you are telling me this ghost story that you probably stole from Tales from the Crypt or Haunted Lives or something like that.
And it is your attempt, your weak attempt, to try and frighten me, which...
It's not gonna work, 'cause I don't frighten easily.
Hey, I'm just telling you the story, all right?
Hey!

DANNY:

What's up, babe?
How was the sabbatical, buddy?
Well, not to oversell it-- it was, without a doubt, the single greatest experience of my lifetime.
Working with the Twa people in Burundi, it forever altered my perspective on my career, my role in the world, and what it means to be human.

Uh, body's this way.
64 years old.
And before she retired, she made a name for herself as a TV medium.
Oh, of course.
I remember all the late-night ads for her psychic hotline.
I guess it makes sense that someone like her would choose to live in a house with this kind of a history, huh?
What history?
Uh, 1940 haunting.
Everybody on the island knows about the well-documented paranormal incident.
Everybody except for Detective Williams.
Let's just stick to reality, like what actually happened on Earth in this house tonight.
We're still trying to make sense of the scene, but, so far, it looks like a home invasion.
Now, our victim called 911 early in the evening to report an intruder.
But by the time HPD got here, she was already dead.
And the weird part is, the alarm was still armed and there's no signs of forced entry.
Okay, well, do we have any idea how the intruder got in and out of the house?
Dispatch just sent me a recording of the 911 call.
You got to hear this.
(beep)
DISPATCHER: 911, what's your location and emergency?
WOMAN:
It's back.
It's in my house.
DISPATCHER:
Ma'am, are you saying there's someone inside your home?
Yes.
Yes.
Yes, it's... it's come for me.
It's come.
DISPATCHER:
Okay, I need you to get to a safe place and lock the door.
(crying):
Oh, my God!
(woman screaming)
(beep) "It's back," huh?
Yeah.
If I got an intruder in my house,
I'm saying "he" or "she"" I'm not calling it "it""
This is peculiar.
What is it, Max?
Well, uh, well, this is just my preliminary observation.
I would have to do a full autopsy in order to give a definitive analysis.
To me, it seems that she died of a sudden and catastrophic cardiac arrest.
So nobody laid a finger on her?
No.
I-In fact, based on the disturbing phone call and the fact that her pupils are dilated, I would say that C.O.D. was the result of overwhelming emotional stress.
Max, what are you saying, exactly?
Well, what I'm trying to say is that, whatever it is that she saw, it literally scared her to death.

So, this year you, uh, you serve your sentence.

So, I'm under house arrest?

Great start, dude.
Uh, Nikki... how long have you been Ms. Webb's assistant?
About, uh, two years now.
At first she just wanted me to organize her personal affairs and... and manage her schedule, but... recently, it became all about keeping her company.
She'd grown terrified of being alone in the house.
Oh.
What, uh, what was she scared of?
(laughs)
Okay, this is gonna sound crazy... but, um... over the past month or so,
Marjorie had become convinced that she was being haunted.
DANNY:
Oh, okay.
By a ghost, naturally.
I know.
I didn't believe it, either, but then I started to see and hear things myself.
What kind of things?
Weird noises.
Items disappearing then turning up somewhere else.
And a few times I heard footsteps when I knew there was no one home but me.
Footsteps.
If it had been one or two isolated incidents
I would have just dismissed it, but... it kept happening.
Trust me, there is something very wrong with this house.

Halloween, 1995.
I was ten.
It was the first time I was able to trick-or-treat without my parents.
So, me and some friends decided to dress up as Power Rangers, which was already embarrassing enough 'cause I drew the short straw, had to go as the pink one.
It was all hunky-dory until we were a few houses in, we notice we were being followed by these creeps with masks.
So, we run, they chase us.
It ends up with me getting separated by my fellow Rangers, surrounded by a bunch of maniacs with knives and hatchets.
So, I'm guessing your Uncle Danny was, uh, one of seven maniacs?
That was pretty great.
You should have seen him;
he lost his mind.

(thunder crashes)
CHIN:
Hold on, so you're saying that the body wasn't in there?
That's right.
And that's not even the weirdest part of it all.
Go on.
(exhales)
See, if I tell you... you ain't gonna believe me.
(creaking)
Well, apparently, Betts wasn't hallucinating after all.
(insects trilling)
Dana?
Dana!
Dana?
Dana?
I don't get it, why would she come out this way?
She could be disoriented from the crash.
ADAM:
Dana!
Dana!
KONO:
Still more blood.
Dana?
Over there.
Dana?
Dana?
Dana?
(grunts, blows falling)
(groans)
(grunts)
(groans)
(gun hammer clicks)
On your knees!
Hands in the air!
(thud)
Wait.
I...
I can hear him.
(higher-pitched):
Mom?
Dad?
He's still here.
Your son Eli is still alive.
WOMAN:
That's amazing!
Isn't that amazing, everyone?
(applause)
Can you tell us anything else, Marjorie?
MARJORIE:
Yes.
Ah...
New Orleans.
It-
- It's so clear.
He was there.
Just a few days ago.
(beeps)
So, after this consultation with Marjorie, the Jones family spent a fortune trying to find their son Eli.
Disgusting.
They hired a private detective, they even moved to New Orleans for six months to try and find him.
But two years and tens of thousands of dollars later, they learned that he was already dead.
In fact, he died within 48 hours of first being reported missing.
I guess Marjorie's psychic powers were on the fritz that day.
Her reputation took a pretty big hit after that.
Soon after, she retired.
I mean, what she put that family through... you got to think, man, they had motive.
Yeah, they do.
Except right after they found out, the whole family moved to Canada.
I think we can rule them out as suspects.
Yeah, makes sense.
Who's gonna exhume their own son for a revenge play?
So we're back to square one.
(phone chimes)
Meaning our prime suspect is still a ghost.
All right, Danny just hit me.
He wants us to meet him at the house.
GROVER:
Okay.
(wind whistling)
Hello?
Danny?
That's weird.
(rattling)
Oh, hell no.
(evil laughter echoes)
Yeah, okay, Danny, you can come now out now.
DANNY (echoing):
How'd you know it was me?
It was a stab in the dark.
Which is what you're gonna get if you don't get out here right now, how about that?
All right, hold on, watch this.
Eric, hit them with the picture frame.
(glass breaks)
You know you're destroying evidence, right?
Where are you?
I'm right here, relax.
Come on, I got to show you something.
You spooked me, man.
Look how cool it is.
♪ I saw a werewolf with a Chinese menu in his hand ♪
♪ Walking through the streets ♪
♪ Of SoHo in the rain ♪
Great job, kiddo, it looks just like you.
♪ A place called Lee Ho Fook's... ♪
You might want to start your pumpkin, Charlie and I are almost done.
I'll pass.
Well, Charlie, my man, if you thought that recreating the Williams family in squash plants was the highlight of your night, think again, 'cause now it's time for the main event.
We're talking ninja-level T.O.T., Uncle Jerry style.
What's "T.O.T.?"
Trick-or-treating.
But wandering around aimlessly with a bucket in your hand is for half-assers.
Which is why we're gonna hack Halloween.
First, we target all the houses with the most decorations.
They always have the top-shelf candy.
And second-- and this is gonna seem counterintuitive-- we go late, when they're looking to dump the booty they got left over.
Capisce?
Great.
Sounds pretty lame to me.
Yeah, you know what's lame?
This texting people who aren't in the room, when you could be spending time with your brother who is.
Sorry, did you say something?
You know what, Grace?
I'm tired of your attitude.
Why don't you put down that phone and... (yells)
Oh, my God!
You should see your face right now.
Seriously?
(laughs)
ERIC:
We found hidden speakers in the wall, blood packets in the faucets, stage wire on the door and bookcases, all hooked up to remote control triggers.
Check this out, this is the attic, where there's definitely enough room for someone to camp out for a couple few days.
That would explain the sleeping bag.
Okay, so, uh, somebody rigs up this entire house, and then camps out in the attic for days on end.
That seems like a lot of trouble to go through to, uh, convince an old woman that she's being haunted, no?
This guy was good, I mean, he knew the blind spots in the security system, which points of entry were unprotected.
Good news is we did recover fingerprints and DNA.
Hopefully we'll get a hit soon.
Lab finished processing Marjorie's phone-- there was spyware on it.
Oh, somebody was listening in?
Yeah, IP address was traced back to a Charles Michael Triblaine.
Better known by his stage name,
"Triblaine the Great."
And what makes Triblaine so great?
Let's find out.
Now, watch, as I'm about to take a bite out of this quarter, huh?
(grunting, then sniffs)
Mm?
But wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
No one leaves here...
(blows) ...shortchanged.
(laughs, crowd applauds) Thank you.
Okay.
TRIBLAINE:
Thank you!
That was pretty great.
A guy like that's definitely got the skills to rig up a haunted house.
Yes, he does.

(dogs barking)
(dogs continue barking, men yelling indistinctly)
(men continue yelling and whooping)
(Dana crying)
(door slams)
(crying):
What are they gonna do to us?
TRIBLAINE:
I'm sorry to hear that Marjorie is dead, but why do you think I killed her?
Well, we did our homework.
Uh, we know about your beef with Marjorie.
We also know that you spent the better part of the last decade trying to destroy her career.
STEVE:
In fact, you were so obsessed with making sure the whole world knew she was a fraud, in 2008, you offered her a half-a-million dollars if she could prove her psychic abilities in a controlled setting on live TV.
Is that not correct?
DANNY:
I personally would've liked to have seen that, uh, but, unfortunately for you, she retired, and you lost your chance to expose her.
STEVE:
Right, and that right there, that's... that's kind of what we call motive.
DANNY:
Yeah.
No to mention, that place, that house it was tricked out like a Vegas magic show, and you had the expertise to do that.
Despite what you may think, magicians are the most honest people in the world.
We tell you that we're gonna deceive you, and then we do, for entertainment.
But people like Marjorie Webb, con men, psychics, spoon benders, faith healers, they're dangerous because they convince their audiences what-- that what they do is real.
That they have special powers.
I have spent my life in pursuit of the truth.
And the truth is that Marjorie Webb was a wicked fraud who brought misery to dozens of people by giving them hope where there wasn't any!
So, yes,
I resented that she didn't receive the public exposure and comeuppance that she deserved.
But...
I wanted justice, I didn't want her dead.
Okay.
You do understand that we can't just eliminate you from this investigation just 'cause you-you said you didn't do it, right?
We're gonna need alibis for certain key dates.
It's gonna be a process, you get that, right?
Of course, um...
Possibly, though, I could also... give help in, uh... catching the real murderer?
Help us?
DANNY:
Yeah?
How you-how you gonna do that?
Your suspect pool is much bigger than you can imagine.
There were the public cases, but Marjorie was also involved in dozens of private consultations over the years.
I have extensive records detailing all the damage that she has done, which I'm happy to share with you, free of charge.
Huh?
But y-you should also know, though, that there's only a couple of places on the island where you can get some of the, uh... items in the spook house that you described.
Happy to point you in the right direction.
All right.
Looks like I got the size right.
Also, I packed you a backup bucket.
That way you'll have an extra one for the overflow.
All right, Grace, it's go time, let's do this.
Let me guess.
You're going as yourself a year from now?
I like it, very meta.
But I think you'll score more candy if you wear your costume.
I'm not coming.
What?
Why not?
It's bad enough that I'm missing an epic Halloween party with my friends.
There's no way I'm dressing up in some stupid costume, begging for candy.
Give me a sec, buddy.
Do you know why I love Halloween so much?
The chocolate?
Just a guess.
It's because it's the one night of the year when you can dress up, and act like a kid, and no one judges you.
Don't be in such a hurry to grow up.
There'll be plenty of time for parties, but how many chances are you gonna get to go trick-or-treating with that little guy over there?
CHARLIE:
Come on, sis.
(snickers) Sorry,
I just can't take you seriously in that costume.
So you're coming?
Still no.
What about Grace?
Sorry, kiddo.
She's not coming.
But we're still gonna have a great time.
CHARLIE:
Boys' night?
(door opens)
JERRY:
That's right.
(door shuts)
(men yelling in the distance, Dana crying)
(chuckling)
What's so funny?
I'm starting to think trouble follows you around,
Mrs. Noshimuri.
Oh, really?
I'm just saying, you know, nothing like this ever happened to me before I met you.
I think I could say the same thing about you.
On the plus side, it's never boring.
(sighs)
Never.
Turtle Bay.
That's where you were taking me?
Hmm.
Yeah, I think I would've preferred that.
(door opens)
Oh, my God.
(groans)

KONO:
Adam.
(Kono grunts)
Please, tell me you meant the whole thing with the axe and the chain.
(chuckles)
Just say yes.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Let's go.
GROVER:
What's up?
Triblaine's alibi checks out.
He was in Europe for the past six months doing performances.
Yeah, well, that would be one hell of a magic trick if he pulled all this off from a different country.
Yeah, we do have a lead on another suspect.
I was able to trace several of the items recovered from the attic back to a magic store here on the island.
According to the owner, the purchases were made by a local guy named Ian Miller.
Okay.
Let's bring him in.
Well, unfortunately, that won't be possible.
HPD discovered the body after responding to a noise complaint.
COD was a stab wound by stiletto blade to the posterior neck area.
Liver temperature puts the time of death at roughly two hours ago.
Okay... this guy... spooks Marjorie Webb to death and then goes back to his own house where, a few short hours later, he's murdered?
Now this is one hell of a coincidence or somebody else knew about Marjorie's death and wanted to make sure
Ian Miller kept his mouth shut.
Right?
An accomplice.
Makes sense with all the... haunted house trickery that there was two of them.
Well, I may have an answer to that.
I found foreign DNA in the form of a hair on Miller's body.
I ran it through the system and got a hit in a most unexpected place.
The DNA profile was in the archives of old missing persons' cases.
Julie Hillman.
She was registered as missing by her family in May 2010... but reported alive and well some four months later.
Wait a minute, we know her.
Nikki Pressman.
Marjorie's assistant.
(whispering):
This way.
(dog barking)
(men yelling)
Get them back.
(men yelling)
Hi, uh, I'm with Five-O.
I need to use your phone.
It's an emergency.
Uh, of course.
Right this way.
Everything all right?
Will be, as soon as we get the police out here.
It's in the kitchen.
Thank you.
There's no phone.
(shotgun hammer clicks)
Ain't no help coming for you.
It's Bobby.
I got them.
My place.
Yeah.
See you soon.
KONO:
Nice to meet you, Bobby.
Hey.
I'm gonna call HPD.
(line ringing)
STEVE:
So, in May of 2010, you,
Julie Hillman, disappeared.
Your parents, they went to the police.
They couldn't get any answers and so, out of desperation, they called Marjorie Webb.
I guess I can understand that.
I would've wanted answers myself.
Any parent who loses a child wants answers.
They want to find their kid, all right?
But Marjorie Webb lied to your parents, didn't she?
She told your parents that you were dead.
They were never gonna see you again.
Now armed with that knowledge, your father went home and he realized he couldn't live with that, so he killed himself.
You know, the saddest part about this story for me is that you were a kid.
You ran away from home.
Kids run away from home.
But as soon as you found out the effect that had on your dad, you went back home and you started plotting your revenge.
Most people would've wanted her dead right away.
I wanted her to suffer the way my family suffered.
The way I suffered.
The way all those other people she hurt suffered.
I wanted her to spend the rest of her days staring at a wall in a mental institution, mumbling to herself about ghosts.
Believe what you want, but the plan was never to kill her.
But you did.
You killed her.
Okay?
And then what happened?
You and your partner, Ian Miller, you're-you're looking at a manslaughter charge you never anticipated.
What happened after that?
Ian must've panicked.
Did he threaten to go to the cops?
I never meant for any of this to happen!
But, you see, it happened.
Y-You stabbed a man in the back of the neck and you killed him.
Now you're looking at a straight-up murder rap, on top of the manslaughter charge.
You know what?
We don't even need a confession.
We got her DNA.
Come on.
Hey, hey, Danny, hold...
just give me a second.
I lost my old man, too.
And there's not a day that goes by I don't think about him, so I understand how this must haunt you, knowing that your running away affected your dad the way it did and if you'd have just gone home, just gone home... your dad would probably still be alive right now.
(sniffles)
I can see how blaming Marjorie was easier.
(lock buzzes)
(latch clicks)
What's going on?
It's Kono.
I can't find the keys.
Okay.
We have a tactical advantage here.
So, we hold them off.
Wait until HPD arrives.
Thing is, this is the only gun and we only have three shells left.
All right, we'll have to improvise.
(sighs)
They're coming!
Dana.
You got to take this, okay?
Anyone comes through that window... okay?
MAN:
Bobby, open up!
MAN 2:
Bobby, open the door.
(screams)
(screams)
I'm out.
Kono.
Okay, fall back, down the hall.
(gunshots blasting)
(groans)
Come on, come on, come on.
I got you, I got you.
In here.
(gunshots blasting)
(gunshots ricocheting)
Okay, bathroom, come on.
(gunshots ricocheting)
I'm out.
I got two left.
(distant gunshots)
(sirens wailing)
(lightly chuckles)
(cries)
You sure you're okay?
Yeah, yeah, I'm good.
Just, uh...
just a few cuts and bruises, a little psychological trauma... but I'll be fine.
Lou, you find anything?
Plenty.
HPD searched the entire compound.
They found two shallow graves with human remains.
Also found a cache of video tapes dating back three years.
It was you two stumbled upon some kind of death cult.
These psychos had a thing for making their own horror movies every Halloween.
BOTH:
Trick or treat.
Mahalo.
CHARLIE:
Gracie, you came.
How'd you guys do?
Not so good.
Come on, Charlie.
I know a house up the street that's always stocked.
My work here is done.
== sync, corrected by elderman == @elder_man
Good afternoon, ma'am.
We've received a number of noise complaints regarding this address.
Is everything okay?
Your husband home?
Ma'am, please step aside.
We're going to have to come in.
Ma'am, we won't ask you again.
Open the door and step aside now.
Go away.
Go away.
Please go away.
Go away.
Hey.
You okay?
You need to leave.
You're going to make them angry.
Who?
What the hell was that?
What's she saying?
She says this place is... haunted.
Get her out of here!
Now!
Please stop.
Don't hurt him.
Please don't.
Please don't hurt him.
All right.
Well, I'm gonna go ahead and say that none of that actually happened.
I will have you know that my old man got the story directly from the desk sergeant who was working that night.
And it was in the papers the next day, so...
It was in the papers in 1940.
Then it must be true.
Right?
Yeah.
I see what you're trying to do, and it's not... it's not gonna work.
What am I trying to do?
Well, we are, walking up to this spooky house.
It's Halloween.
And, you are telling me this ghost story that you probably stole from Tales from the Crypt or Haunted Lives or something like that.
And it is your attempt, your weak attempt, to try and frighten me, which...
It's not gonna work, 'cause I don't frighten easily.
Hey, I'm just telling you the story, all right?
Hey!
Max!
Max!
Back in the building.
What's up, babe?
How was the sabbatical, buddy?
Well, not to oversell it-- it was, without a doubt, the single greatest experience of my lifetime.
Working with the Twa people in Burundi, it forever altered my perspective on my career, my role in the world, and what it means to be human.
Well, that's fantastic.
That's awesome.
And I like...
You got the beard.
It looks nice.
I love it!
Nice new style.
Look at the long hair.
Actually, this facial hair is part of my Halloween costume.
I'm playing the titular character of the film John Wick, which is my latest tribute to the film legacy of...
Keanu Reeves.
I've seen this one, and I-I like the attention to detail, with the wedding ring and everything.
You are correct in noting that this wedding ring was worn by the character John Wick even after the untimely passing of his wife.
However, I'm wearing it because I married Sabrina.
Excuse me?
Way to bury the lead, Max.
Mazel tov, buddy.
That's...that's fantastic.
Congratulations, Max.
That's awesome.
Hey, Chin, guess what.
Max and Sabrina tied the knot.
What?
That's great news!
Hey.
Ho'omaika'i 'Ana, Max.
Mahalo.
I want to hear all about it.
Right now we got work to do.
Body's this way.
64 years old.
And before she retired, she made a name for herself as a TV medium.
Of course.
I remember all the late-night ads for her psychic hotline.
I guess it makes sense that someone like her would choose to live in a house with this kind of a history?
What history?
1940 haunting.
Everybody on the island knows about the well-documented paranormal incident.
Everybody except for Detective Williams.
Let's just stick to reality, like what actually happened on Earth in this house tonight.
We're still trying to make sense of the scene, but, so far, it looks like a home invasion.
Now, our victim called 911 early in the evening to report an intruder.
But by the time HPD got here, she was already dead.
And the weird part is, the alarm was still armed and there's no signs of forced entry.
Okay, well, do we have any idea how the intruder got in and out of the house?
Dispatch just sent me a recording of the 911 call.
You got to hear this.
911, what's your location and emergency?
It's back.
It's in my house.
Ma'am, are you saying there's someone inside your home?
Yes.
Yes.
Yes, it's... it's come for me.
It's come.
Okay, I need you to get to a safe place and lock the door.
My God!
"It's back,"
Yeah.
If I got an intruder in my house,
I'm saying "he" or "she"" I'm not calling it "it""
This is peculiar.
What is it, Max?
Well, well, this is just my preliminary observation.
I would have to do a full autopsy in order to give a definitive analysis.
To me, it seems that she died of a sudden and catastrophic cardiac arrest.
So nobody laid a finger on her?
No.
I-In fact, based on the disturbing phone call and the fact that her pupils are dilated, I would say that C.O.D. was the result of overwhelming emotional stress.
Max, what are you saying, exactly?
Well, what I'm trying to say is that, whatever it is that she saw, it literally scared her to death.
It's bad enough I'm grounded on Halloween.
Why do I need a babysitter?
I'm 14.
Okay, listen to me, if you will recall, last year, you deliberately, deliberately disobeyed your parents and you snuck off to a party, okay?
So, this year you, you serve your sentence.
The babysitter's just there to make sure you do your time, okay?
So, I'm under house arrest?
No, you're not under house arrest.
You are free to go trick-or-treating with your little brother.
This is cruel and unusual punishment.
Well, don't do the crime if you can't do the time.
All right?
Doorbell.
Sounds like the babysitter's there.
I love you.
I got to go.
Okay?
Have fun.
Can you help me?
I seem to have lost my head.
Charlie, Jerry's here!
That's right.
And I got big plans for us.
We're gonna make Halloween cookies, carve pumpkins and, of course, go trick-or-treating.
That all sounds so thrilling.
I know, right?
Right.
Sarcasm.
I get it.
Great start, dude.
Nikki... how long have you been Ms. Webb's assistant?
About, two years now.
At first she just wanted me to organize her personal affairs and... and manage her schedule, but... recently, it became all about keeping her company.
She'd grown terrified of being alone in the house.
What, what was she scared of?
Okay, this is gonna sound crazy... but, um... over the past month or so,
Marjorie had become convinced that she was being haunted.
Okay.
By a ghost, naturally.
I know.
I didn't believe it, either, but then I started to see and hear things myself.
What kind of things?
Weird noises.
Items disappearing then turning up somewhere else.
And a few times I heard footsteps when I knew there was no one home but me.
Footsteps.
If it had been one or two isolated incidents
I would have just dismissed it, but... it kept happening.
Trust me, there is something very wrong with this house.
Okay.
All right, well, listen, thank you very for your time.
- Thank you.
- Guys.
Let's take a look at this.
Our Vic upgraded her security over the past two weeks and had a 16-channel camera system installed.
Which is great for us 'cause, trust me, you need to see this to believe it.
Hold on.
I'm gonna cue this up to the 911 call.
Okay.
It's come for me.
It's come.
My God!
Pretty great we get to spend this time together,
Uncle D?
Absolutely.
This place...
I've heard some crazy rumors about this place.
You mean it's haunted?
It's true, it is.
Wait, what?
I'm just kidding.
Come on.
Not cool, dude.
What's eating him?
Nothing.
He's, he scares easily.
Yeah, who's to blame for that?
What's the matter, Eric?
Did your Uncle Danny do something terrible to you?
No, not really... just psychologically scarred me for life is all.
He has that effect on some people.
Halloween, 1995.
I was ten.
It was the first time I was able to trick-or-treat without my parents.
So, me and some friends decided to dress up as Power Rangers, which was already embarrassing enough 'cause I drew the short straw, had to go as the pink one.
It was all hunky-dory until we were a few houses in, we notice we were being followed by these creeps with masks.
So, we run, they chase us.
It ends up with me getting separated by my fellow Rangers, surrounded by a bunch of maniacs with knives and hatchets.
So, I'm guessing your Uncle Danny was, one of seven maniacs?
That was pretty great.
You should have seen him;
he lost his mind.
I also lost control of my bladder.
Took me till high school to shake the name Pee Pee Russo.
You say I'm sadistic.
You're sick.
It was not that bad, okay?
A tougher kid might not have wet his unitard.
His pink unitard.
Eric?
Eric?
Hey, listen...
I need you to tear this place apart, find out how our perp got in and out without tripping the alarms.
All right, I can do it.
I'm on it.
All right.
Hey, you guys, sticking around, right?
Yeah, no one wants you to have another accident.
Don't pay no attention to him, Pee Pee.
Ha!
You guys...
All right, let's, let's put aside the "how" for a minute, and-and focus on the why would somebody want Marjorie Webb dead?
Well, start off with, she's a con artist, she's telling people she got psychic powers, hustling folks out of their hard-earned money.
I would say the suspect pool is very broad.
I'll dig into her financials, maybe I can compile a list.
I just dumped Marjorie's phone.
Over the past couple of weeks, she made over 40 calls to the same number.
Ghostbusters?
Close.
Local priest.
This just keeps gettin' better.
Okay, you're not even gonna ask?
You said it was a surprise, so, no.
I don't get you.
See, if it was me, I'd at least be a little bit curious about where we were going.
Then there'd be some questions, some light interrogation.
Kono, I spent the last ten months in nine by 12 cell with a lifer named Nugget, so... when my wife tells me she's taking me on a weekend getaway,
I don't ask questions.
You never told me about Nugget.
Yeah, it's not something I'm ready to talk about.
I'm just kidding.
He's actually a really interesting guy.
Adam!
You okay?
My God, thank you!
What happened?
Back there, we had an accident.
My friend, she's still in the car.
I tried calling 911 but my phone won't work.
Okay, how far?
I don't know.
About half a mile.
All right, get in.
It's this way.
No... no!
No, no, no, no, no.
Your friend, you said she was conscious when you left her?
I think so, but... but she was pinned against the wheel.
How the hell did she get out?
It's blood.
Hurry!
She couldn't have gone far.
You're telling me, buddy?
I gotta live with her.
She turned 14, and all of a sudden she's bipolar.
Moods all over the place.
It's nuts.
On the phone all the time, texting all the time,
I don't know.
Have you considered maybe she's got a boyfriend?
No.
I had not considered that, Jerry, but now that's all I'll be thinking about, so thank you.
Anyway, I haven't given up on her yet.
If anyone can put Grace in the Halloween spirit, it's good old Uncle Jer.
Hi, Danno!
Hey, buddy.
Is that, is that a knife in his hand, Jerry?
We're carving pumpkins.
Well, to be honest, I'm doing the carving.
His is made of rubber.
Jerry, don't maim my children, okay?
Do my best!
Hey, Cortana!
Play my pumpkin carving mix.
Great.
What are you yelling about?
Look!
Yo...
I must be some kind of criminal mastermind to get pulled out of lockup for a sit-down with Five-O.
Yeah, relax, Godfather.
We're not interested in the little misdemeanor possession charge you got pinched on.
We are, however, very interested in how a low-rent junkie like yourself ends up with a $5,000 check from Marjorie Webb.
You recognize that name, there, genius?
"Nathan Betts."
See, that's you.
She make this check out on the 27th.
You went to a check cashing spot on the 28th and cashed it.
I'm sure your dealer had your money in his hand before lunch.
Yeah, yeah.
You're right about that.
What'd she pay you for, Nathan?
Let's just say, um, I did some landscaping work for her.
Let's just say... you're gonna need to elaborate on that.
And you're gonna have to incentivize me if you want me to talk.
Incentivize you?
Okay!
Well, how's this:
you cooperate, and we'll take you back to county lockup to be arraigned.
Don't, and I'll personally make a call to the U.S. Attorney to make sure you end up in a supermax for a very extended vacation.
How's that for a deal?
Supermax.
All right.
Fair enough.
About a week ago, this, this Marjorie woman approaches me on the street and asks me if I want some work.
Being the enterprising young man that I am, I say sure.
What was the job?
Well, that's where it gets a little freaky.
You see, she hired me to break into a cemetery and dig up a grave.
Whose grave?
Some guy named Eli Jones.
Hold on, so you're saying that the body wasn't in there?
That's right.
And that's not even the weirdest part of it all.
Go on.
See, if I tell you... you ain't gonna believe me.
Well, apparently, Betts wasn't hallucinating after all.
Dana?
Dana!
Dana?
Dana?
I don't get it, why would she come out this way?
She could be disoriented from the crash.
Dana!
Dana!
Still more blood.
Dana?
Over there.
Dana?
Dana?
Dana?
On your knees!
Hands in the air!
Wait.
I...
I can hear him.
Mom?
Dad?
He's still here.
Your son Eli is still alive.
That's amazing!
Isn't that amazing, everyone?
Can you tell us anything else, Marjorie?
Yes....
New Orleans.
It-
- It's so clear.
He was there.
Just a few days ago.
So, after this consultation with Marjorie, the Jones family spent a fortune trying to find their son Eli.
Disgusting.
They hired a private detective, they even moved to New Orleans for six months to try and find him.
But two years and tens of thousands of dollars later, they learned that he was already dead.
In fact, he died within 48 hours of first being reported missing.
I guess Marjorie's psychic powers were on the fritz that day.
Her reputation took a pretty big hit after that.
Soon after, she retired.
I mean, what she put that family through... you got to think, man, they had motive.
Yeah, they do.
Except right after they found out, the whole family moved to Canada.
I think we can rule them out as suspects.
Yeah, makes sense.
Who's gonna exhume their own son for a revenge play?
So we're back to square one.
Meaning our prime suspect is still a ghost.
All right, Danny just hit me.
He wants us to meet him at the house.
Okay.
Hello?
Danny?
That's weird.
Hell no.
Yeah, okay, Danny, you can come now out now.
How'd you know it was me?
It was a stab in the dark.
Which is what you're gonna get if you don't get out here right now, how about that?
All right, hold on, watch this.
Eric, hit them with the picture frame.
You know you're destroying evidence, right?
Where are you?
I'm right here, relax.
Come on, I got to show you something.
You spooked me, man.
Look how cool it is.
Great job, kiddo, it looks just like you.
You might want to start your pumpkin, Charlie and I are almost done.
I'll pass.
Well, Charlie, my man, if you thought that recreating the Williams family in squash plants was the highlight of your night, think again, 'cause now it's time for the main event.
We're talking ninja-level T.O.T., Uncle Jerry style.
What's "T.O.T.?"
Trick-or-treating.
But wandering around aimlessly with a bucket in your hand is for half-assers.
Which is why we're gonna hack Halloween.
First, we target all the houses with the most decorations.
They always have the top-shelf candy.
And second-- and this is gonna seem counterintuitive-- we go late, when they're looking to dump the booty they got left over.
Capisce?
Great.
Sounds pretty lame to me.
Yeah, you know what's lame?
This texting people who aren't in the room, when you could be spending time with your brother who is.
Sorry, did you say something?
You know what, Grace?
I'm tired of your attitude.
Why don't you put down that phone and...
My God!
You should see your face right now.
Seriously?
We found hidden speakers in the wall, blood packets in the faucets, stage wire on the door and bookcases, all hooked up to remote control triggers.
Check this out, this is the attic, where there's definitely enough room for someone to camp out for a couple few days.
That would explain the sleeping bag.
Okay, so, somebody rigs up this entire house, and then camps out in the attic for days on end.
That seems like a lot of trouble to go through to, convince an old woman that she's being haunted, no?
This guy was good, I mean, he knew the blind spots in the security system, which points of entry were unprotected.
Good news is we did recover fingerprints and DNA.
Hopefully we'll get a hit soon.
Lab finished processing Marjorie's phone-- there was spyware on it.
Somebody was listening in?
Yeah, IP address was traced back to a Charles Michael Triblaine.
Better known by his stage name,
"Triblaine the Great."
And what makes Triblaine so great?
Let's find out.
Now, watch, as I'm about to take a bite out of this quarter?
But wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
No one leaves here shortchanged.
Thank you.
- Okay.
- Thank you!
That was pretty great.
A guy like that's definitely got the skills to rig up a haunted house.
Yes, he does.
What are they gonna do to us?
I'm sorry to hear that Marjorie is dead, but why do you think I killed her?
Well, we did our homework.
We know about your beef with Marjorie.
We also know that you spent the better part of the last decade trying to destroy her career.
In fact, you were so obsessed with making sure the whole world knew she was a fraud, in 2008, you offered her a half-a-million dollars if she could prove her psychic abilities in a controlled setting on live TV.
Is that not correct?
I personally would've liked to have seen that, but, unfortunately for you, she retired, and you lost your chance to expose her.
Right, and that right there, that's... that's kind of what we call motive.
Yeah.
No to mention, that place, that house it was tricked out like a Vegas magic show, and you had the expertise to do that.
Despite what you may think, magicians are the most honest people in the world.
We tell you that we're gonna deceive you, and then we do, for entertainment.
But people like Marjorie Webb, con men, psychics, spoon benders, faith healers, they're dangerous because they convince their audiences what-- that what they do is real.
That they have special powers.
I have spent my life in pursuit of the truth.
And the truth is that Marjorie Webb was a wicked fraud who brought misery to dozens of people by giving them hope where there wasn't any!
So, yes,
I resented that she didn't receive the public exposure and comeuppance that she deserved.
But...
I wanted justice, I didn't want her dead.
Okay.
You do understand that we can't just eliminate you from this investigation just 'cause you-you said you didn't do it, right?
We're gonna need alibis for certain key dates.
It's gonna be a process, you get that, right?
Of course, um...
Possibly, though, I could also... give help in... catching the real murderer?
- Help us?
- Yeah?
How you-how you gonna do that?
Your suspect pool is much bigger than you can imagine.
There were the public cases, but Marjorie was also involved in dozens of private consultations over the years.
I have extensive records detailing all the damage that she has done, which I'm happy to share with you, free of charge.
But y-you should also know, though, that there's only a couple of places on the island where you can get some of the... items in the spook house that you described.
Happy to point you in the right direction.
All right.
Looks like I got the size right.
Also, I packed you a backup bucket.
That way you'll have an extra one for the overflow.
All right, Grace, it's go time, let's do this.
Let me guess.
You're going as yourself a year from now?
I like it, very meta.
But I think you'll score more candy if you wear your costume.
I'm not coming.
What?
Why not?
It's bad enough that I'm missing an epic Halloween party with my friends.
There's no way I'm dressing up in some stupid costume, begging for candy.
Give me a sec, buddy.
Do you know why I love Halloween so much?
The chocolate?
Just a guess.
It's because it's the one night of the year when you can dress up, and act like a kid, and no one judges you.
Don't be in such a hurry to grow up.
There'll be plenty of time for parties, but how many chances are you gonna get to go trick-or-treating with that little guy over there?
Come on, sis.
Sorry,
I just can't take you seriously in that costume.
So you're coming?
Still no.
What about Grace?
Sorry, kiddo.
She's not coming.
But we're still gonna have a great time.
Boys' night?
That's right.
What's so funny?
I'm starting to think trouble follows you around,
Mrs. Noshimuri.
Really?
I'm just saying, you know, nothing like this ever happened to me before I met you.
I think I could say the same thing about you.
On the plus side, it's never boring.
Never.
Turtle Bay.
That's where you were taking me?
Yeah, I think I would've preferred that.
My God.
Adam.
Please, tell me you meant the whole thing with the axe and the chain.
Just say yes.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Let's go.
What's up?
Triblaine's alibi checks out.
He was in Europe for the past six months doing performances.
Yeah, well, that would be one hell of a magic trick if he pulled all this off from a different country.
Yeah, we do have a lead on another suspect.
I was able to trace several of the items recovered from the attic back to a magic store here on the island.
According to the owner, the purchases were made by a local guy named Ian Miller.
Okay.
Let's bring him in.
Well, unfortunately, that won't be possible.
HPD discovered the body after responding to a noise complaint.
COD was a stab wound by stiletto blade to the posterior neck area.
Liver temperature puts the time of death at roughly two hours ago.
Okay... this guy... spooks Marjorie Webb to death and then goes back to his own house where, a few short hours later, he's murdered?
Now this is one hell of a coincidence or somebody else knew about Marjorie's death and wanted to make sure
Ian Miller kept his mouth shut.
Right?
An accomplice.
Makes sense with all the... haunted house trickery that there was two of them.
Well, I may have an answer to that.
I found foreign DNA in the form of a hair on Miller's body.
I ran it through the system and got a hit in a most unexpected place.
The DNA profile was in the archives of old missing persons' cases.
Julie Hillman.
She was registered as missing by her family in May 2010... but reported alive and well some four months later.
Wait a minute, we know her.
Nikki Pressman.
Marjorie's assistant.
This way.
Get them back.
Hi, I'm with Five-O.
I need to use your phone.
It's an emergency.
Of course.
Right this way.
Everything all right?
Will be, as soon as we get the police out here.
It's in the kitchen.
Thank you.
There's no phone.
Ain't no help coming for you.
It's Bobby.
I got them.
My place.
Yeah.
See you soon.
Nice to meet you, Bobby.
Hey.
I'm gonna call HPD.
So, in May of 2010, you,
Julie Hillman, disappeared.
Your parents, they went to the police.
They couldn't get any answers and so, out of desperation, they called Marjorie Webb.
I guess I can understand that.
I would've wanted answers myself.
Any parent who loses a child wants answers.
They want to find their kid, all right?
But Marjorie Webb lied to your parents, didn't she?
She told your parents that you were dead.
They were never gonna see you again.
Now armed with that knowledge, your father went home and he realized he couldn't live with that, so he killed himself.
You know, the saddest part about this story for me is that you were a kid.
You ran away from home.
Kids run away from home.
But as soon as you found out the effect that had on your dad, you went back home and you started plotting your revenge.
Most people would've wanted her dead right away.
I wanted her to suffer the way my family suffered.
The way I suffered.
The way all those other people she hurt suffered.
I wanted her to spend the rest of her days staring at a wall in a mental institution, mumbling to herself about ghosts.
Believe what you want, but the plan was never to kill her.
But you did.
You killed her.
Okay?
And then what happened?
You and your partner, Ian Miller, you're-you're looking at a manslaughter charge you never anticipated.
What happened after that?
Ian must've panicked.
Did he threaten to go to the cops?
I never meant for any of this to happen!
But, you see, it happened.
Y-You stabbed a man in the back of the neck and you killed him.
Now you're looking at a straight-up murder rap, on top of the manslaughter charge.
You know what?
We don't even need a confession.
We got her DNA.
Come on.
Hey, hey, Danny, hold...
just give me a second.
I lost my old man, too.
And there's not a day that goes by I don't think about him, so I understand how this must haunt you, knowing that your running away affected your dad the way it did and if you'd have just gone home, just gone home... your dad would probably still be alive right now.
I can see how blaming Marjorie was easier.
What's going on?
It's Kono.
I can't find the keys.
Okay.
We have a tactical advantage here.
So, we hold them off.
Wait until HPD arrives.
Thing is, this is the only gun and we only have three shells left.
All right, we'll have to improvise.
They're coming!
Dana.
You got to take this, okay?
Anyone comes through that window... okay?
Bobby, open up!
Bobby, open the door.
I'm out.
Kono.
Okay, fall back, down the hall.
Come on, come on, come on.
I got you, I got you.
In here.
Okay, bathroom, come on.
I'm out.
I got two left.
You sure you're okay?
Yeah, yeah, I'm good.
Just...
just a few cuts and bruises, a little psychological trauma... but I'll be fine.
Lou, you find anything?
Plenty.
HPD searched the entire compound.
They found two shallow graves with human remains.
Also found a cache of video tapes dating back three years.
It was you two stumbled upon some kind of death cult.
These psychos had a thing for making their own horror movies every Halloween.
Trick or treat.
Mahalo.
Gracie, you came.
How'd you guys do?
Not so good.
Come on, Charlie.
I know a house up the street that's always stocked.
My work here is done.
== sync, corrected by elderman == @elder_man
So I made it through my year of coming out to the world.
It went better than expected, but there was still one social hurdle to clear.
- So?
- Yes.
Prom.
An opportunity wasted on all these straight couples with no imagination and zero design sense.
Hey, I want to pitch you my prom-posal for Lacey.
- Oh.
- Roses.
And?
From the grocery store. [Chuckles]
Okay, I will fix this later.
Right now I have to go to V.P. Murray's office and demand that this school let me take a boy to prom.
And not just for me, but for all gay kids who follow.
Dude!
Hey!
You messed up my banner!
Fine.
I'll help you fix it, but this is a high-traffic area.
You did not think this through.
Don't just stand there.
Where's your glitter glue?
- What?
- You're a lost cause.
I don't know.
If I accept his friendship, isn't that sending the wrong message?
You frenched your children's vice principal.
I'd say that sends a pretty strong message.
Now it's your job to gather intel and see if you want to take it further.
Okay, fine.
I'll do it.
[Computer dings]
Yes!
And now the dance begins.
- Oh.
- Oh, dear Lord.
He's wearing shorts.
Hey.
Hey, you know what,
Jimmy's been asking for money for a limo for prom.
Does he even have a date?
No.
He's still working on his prom-posal.
These days, kids make a bigger deal out of asking each other to prom than you did asking me to marry you.
It feels like they've been talking about this prom for months.
I'll be excited when it's over.
Oh, I like seeing children in evening wear.
I like seeing cats in glasses.
Well, done with this conversation.
[Computer dings]
Oh, my God, V.P. Murray has liked all your photos in that time.
He liked that I liked Talbots?
- What's this video?
- [Key clicks]
Here it is... an original composition on my theremin.
Uh, fun fact... this is the only one in Illinois.
[Sniffs]
[Theremin plays]
Nope.
I'm out.
Un-friend.
- [Groans] - [Computer chimes]
What?
!
Where did she go?
[Knock on door]
Uh, Kenny, hey.
Apropos of nothing, do you know if your mom changes her privacy settings often, you know, on the social media and... and the like?
V.P. Murray, it is my right as an American citizen and a student of this school to have the freedoms allowed to all the other students.
- You want to take a boy to the prom.
- If the supreme court could see fit...
- You can take a boy to the prom.
- I have a letter from a lawyer.
Well, then, frame it because you are taking a male to the prom.
Who's the lucky guy?
Oh, crap.
There is no lucky guy.
I did not think this through.
Cover.
Cover.
I'm the lucky guy for taking this brave step forward.
Freedom.
[Bleep]
That's all I was asking for.
You know, I like...
- Hey, Shannon.
- Hi.
I wanted to make sure you got the math assignment.
Oh.
No, thanks, Ethan.
I'm good.
Shannon, you didn't even think about it.
You know, some people had to fight for the right to go to prom.
Once they had that right, had no one to go with.
I'm talking about me.
I just don't understand why you want to get hysterically excited about prom, only to be utterly disappointed by the outcome.
Because I am an American!
But I'm never gonna get what I want 'cause I'm the only gay kid in this whole school.
Stuart:
Hi.
What about clearly gay Stuart?
- Come here.
Mah!
- [Both laugh]
Well, I'm starting to think he might just be "Stuart."
Maybe you could go with that barista from Rigby's Roasters.
Isn't he gay?
Are you saying that because he's the only other gay guy you know?
- Yes.
- [Groans]
What's up?
Jimmy, can you think of any gay guys Kenny can take to prom?
Oh!
What about the barista from Rigby's Roasters?
- Wasn't he gay?
- You think I'm gonna take somebody when the only thing we have in common is that we're both gay?
I think that's more important than, say, uh, you both liking tennis.
Yo!
What up, Lacey?
!
Hey, Jimmy.
You smell like eggs.
- [Mumbles]
- What are you doing?
You could have asked her right there.
As you can see, I'm not good off the cuff.
I have to plan it.
Yeah?
Well, I don't even have anyone to plan for.
And I'm not asking for much.
I just want love at first sight with the perfect boy and the perfect kiss and the perfect night.

I thought you'd want to meet him since you both play for the same team.
And I'm not talking about a sports team.
You're both gay.
Just because they're both gay doesn't mean that they want...
Shut up.

[Sighs]
[Balloon humming]
Did we make that happen?
I hope so.
[Laughs] It works!
Oh, and it's awesome!
That's up for debate.
This is gonna be the best prom-posal ever.
Lacey and Sebastian are for sure gonna say yes.
Because of a fish balloon?
No, because of a self-mobilizing fish drone.
It's gonna hover over Sebastian and Lacey, then I'm gonna pop it and it's gonna rain down Swedish fish, you know, 'cause Sebastian is Swedish.
And Lacey loves processed foods.
Prom is so over-hyped.
It's for amateurs, like Valentine's Day and New Year's.
- Mm-hmm.
- The most romantic night of your life could happen in a random parking lot on a Tuesday night.
You don't understand gay or straight romance.
I'm not sure you do, either.
Fine!
You'll see.
- How'd it go?
- Great.
I called Clive, and I told him it's not gonna work.
He took it really well, and we parted as friends.
In fact, I told him I'd help him chaperone at the prom.
Oh, my God, he's taking you to the prom.
No, he is not!
I am going as a single adult there to make sure the kids don't grope each other.
[Cellphone chimes]
"Hey, boo.
What color is your dress for the prom?
I want my boutonniere to match"?
See, he thinks it's a date.
How can he possibly think that?
Are you sure you were clear with him when you broke it off?
I told him I'm really busy right now and I'm not in a great place and I just don't think it's meant to be.
Okay, see, what he heard is, "when things die down,
I'll be ready, so wait for me."
[Sighs] I need your help.
Teach me how to kill his hope.
My whole life has led to this moment.
[Laughter]
Okay, there they are.
There they are.
Launch it.
I told you you put too many Swedish fish in the fish.
No, but the physics were right.
I calculated the trajectory.
I just need to redistribute the weight.

Okay, go!

Uh, hello!
Excuse me.

Wait, what the...?
I'm coming out of the closet!
And I'm gay for you, Sebastian.
Prom...
Question mark?
Ja.
Just when I gave him the benefit of the doubt.
Yes!
Thank you!
Damn it!
Okay, look, I feel for you, but let's get this fish moving.
I still have a chance with Lacey, okay?
Okay.
Hey, Lacey!
Wow, Devon.
That's a lot of cheese.
What do you say?
"No."
Sure!
It's processed.
That's her favorite.
Why didn't I think of that?
Because it's literally the worst idea ever.
[Thud]
Everyone is staring at us.
What do we do?
We melt their hearts.
Kenny, my gay brother...
[Candy clatters] ...will you go to prom with me?
Yes?
Together:
Aww.
[Applause]
This went exactly as we planned.
♪
I can't believe I took on a Catholic school so I could take a same-sex date to prom, and the date ends up being my brother.
It's too sad to even write a country song about.
Look, we're sitting in the sweet spot right now.
Everyone's hopes are super-high for prom, but... but, like Shannon said, they will eventually be let down by the reality.
And that's where we swoop in, and we give Sebastian and Lacey a night they will never forget.
Maybe you're right.
I mean, Stuart is borrowing his mom's Passat, but there's no way he can sustain that level of excitement all evening.
Exactly!
And when their disappointment is at its highest, they're gonna look over and go, "whoa, who are those handsome brothers getting all Hemsworth up in the prom?"

Let's be honest.
That's just gonna look like a cost plus world market.
[Chuckles]
I'm glad I told Ethan no.
Wait, hang on.
You got asked to prom by some guy named Ethan?
He sounds amazing.
Why didn't you tell me?
There was nothing to tell.
Prom sucks.
You said it yourself.
Oh, honey, prom doesn't suck for everyone.
It just sucked for me because I didn't have a date.
Nobody wanted to go with fatty Patty.
I thought nobody asked you, and I didn't want you to feel bad like I did.
I'm happy sitting here watching "Carrie" with you.
No, honey, trust me, you don't want to be my age and regret that you didn't get dressed up and have a glamorous night with your friends and impress them with how well you do "the Tootsee Roll."

Great.

Oh, look at that disco ball.
It's just as wonderful as I imagined it.
Oh, yes, it's a ball with mirrors glued to it.

Okay, so which one of these guys asked you?
Ethan.
He's right there in the moss-green bow tie, but it looks like he's here with somebody else.
I'm gonna go get us some punch.
Wait, there's punch?
For free?
Hey, green tie.
Officer O'Neal.
He's a cop?
Uh, I'm not here in my official capacity.
I'm here just as Shannon's dad.
Look, could you do me a favor and just give Shannon one dance?
I don't want her to regret saying no to you.
You asked someone else first?

- [Sobbing]
- Oh, I'm sorry, man.
Dad, what are you doing?
Embarrassing me and making my date cry.
I can see why you O'Neals only date each other!
[Sobbing]
I'm sorry, honey, I want to make this right, but that girl's heading for her drug purse, and I can't let that happen.
Hey, don't smoke anything out of that purse!
I'm sorry, Ethan.
This is exactly the kind of dumb prom drama
I did not want to get involved in.
No, I'm glad this happened because my heart just wasn't in it with Paula.
You and I are like quantum entanglement.

Huh.
Maybe I set the bar too high?
Look, uh, this is weird for all of us, but your dad and I are moving on.
It's just part of divorce.
And I get that.
What upsets me is that you could... you could totally do better than Vice Principal Murray.
Really?
Yeah.
You... you're smart.
And you're funny.
I mean, y-you remember that time the neighborhood had a... had a peeping Tom?
Who did he peep on first?
You.
That's true.
It was really scary.
[Groans]
I'm sorry I ruined your prom.
I thought prom didn't matter to me because it didn't, then Ethan referenced one of the great mysteries of physics, and my heart got all fluttery at prom.
I'm just like every other teenage girl.
Honey, I hate to break it to you, but you are not like any other teenage girl.
Thanks.
I pride myself on keeping my edge.
Want to go catch up with Ethan, huh?
No, our paths will cross again.
Maybe in our 30s in Prague.
Maybe in the 10th grade on our teen tour.
Ugh.
There I go again.
Yeah, I think we're all getting a little caught up in the Moroccan mystique.
- [Chuckles]
- Anyways, Ethan can wait.
I already have a date.
Hey, someone finally asked me to the prom.
Want to go to the snack table?
There's a chocolate fountain.
Oh, my God!
He is so simple.
All right, I'm having a totally crappy time, and I'd like my date to take me home.
What happened?
All right, I'm gonna tell you because I'm very frustrated, but no comments.
Things didn't work out with you and Sebastian?
Well, we kissed.
What?
You had your first boy kiss?
!
That's awesome!
Look at...
look at it!
The O'Neals are getting some!
Ha ha.
I mean... except...
except for me.
I'm not.
But I'm...
I'm still happy for you guys.
"You guys"?
What, Mom, did you get some?
You were telling your story.
Go on.
Okay, well, Sebastian and I kissed, and I thought it was gonna be this amazing moment.
I mean, he is good-looking.
He says his Y's like J's, and he's short-tall, so he's not intimidating, but he can still hold me.
But it didn't feel as amazing as I thought it would.
I was expecting 4th of July, and it felt more like...
- August 9th.
- [Chuckles]
National Rice Pudding Day.
[Sighs]
It sucks that it was just ordinary.
You know what that means.
That I'm probably straight and I should kiss a girl.
No.
It means you're normal.
You think I'm normal?
Of course I do.
Listen.
You can't force a connection.
You don't know when it's gonna happen or with whom.
He may not dress the way you like or play an instrument that doesn't sound like a... crying robot.
You can't account for chemistry.
Well, thank you.
And it sounds like you have quite a story to tell.
For another day.
- Murray:
I now present to you this year's...
- What are you doing?
!
Everybody has to get inside this totally rad prom right now!
Jimmy and Kenny are being named non-gender-specific prom monarchs."
- [Chuckling] What?
- What?
[Fanfare plays]
You have your mother's eyes.

Once again, the O'Neals did what we do best...
We took an evening of disappointment and embarrassment, and we made it into a night to remember.
My family has been through a lot these last few months, and it's moments like these that give me hope that we just might be...

Does our family spend too much time together?
Yes.
Yes, we do.

- Hey, sorry about your kiss.
- Yeah.
Was it at least better than kissing a girl?
Oh, hell, yeah.
At this point, I would kiss anyone.
Well...

So I made it through my year of coming out to the world.
It went better than expected, but there was still one social hurdle to clear.
- So?
- Yes.
Prom.
An opportunity wasted on all these straight couples with no imagination and zero design sense.
Hey, I want to pitch you my prom-posal for Lacey.
- Oh.
- Roses.
And?
From the grocery store.
Okay, I will fix this later.
Right now I have to go to V.P. Murray's office and demand that this school let me take a boy to prom.
And not just for me, but for all gay kids who follow.
Dude!
Hey!
You messed up my banner!
Fine.
I'll help you fix it, but this is a high-traffic area.
You did not think this through.
Don't just stand there.
Where's your glitter glue?
- What?
- You're a lost cause.
I don't know.
If I accept his friendship, isn't that sending the wrong message?
You frenched your children's vice principal.
I'd say that sends a pretty strong message.
Now it's your job to gather intel and see if you want to take it further.
Okay, fine.
I'll do it.
Yes!
And now the dance begins.
- Oh.
- Oh, dear Lord.
He's wearing shorts.
Hey.
Hey, you know what,
Jimmy's been asking for money for a limo for prom.
Does he even have a date?
No.
He's still working on his prom-posal.
These days, kids make a bigger deal out of asking each other to prom than you did asking me to marry you.
It feels like they've been talking about this prom for months.
I'll be excited when it's over.
Oh, I like seeing children in evening wear.
I like seeing cats in glasses.
Well, done with this conversation.
Oh, my God, V.P. Murray has liked all your photos in that time.
He liked that I liked Talbots?
What's this video?
Here it is... an original composition on my theremin.
Uh, fun fact... this is the only one in Illinois.
Nope.
I'm out.
Un-friend.
What?
!
Where did she go?
Uh, Kenny, hey.
Apropos of nothing, do you know if your mom changes her privacy settings often, you know, on the social media and... and the like?
V.P. Murray, it is my right as an American citizen and a student of this school to have the freedoms allowed to all the other students.
- You want to take a boy to the prom.
- If the supreme court could see fit...
- You can take a boy to the prom.
- I have a letter from a lawyer.
Well, then, frame it because you are taking a male to the prom.
Who's the lucky guy?
Oh, crap.
There is no lucky guy.
I did not think this through.
Cover.
Cover.
I'm the lucky guy for taking this brave step forward.
Freedom.
That's all I was asking for.
You know, I like...
- Hey, Shannon.
- Hi.
I wanted to make sure you got the math assignment.
Oh.
No, thanks, Ethan.
I'm good.
Shannon, you didn't even think about it.
You know, some people had to fight for the right to go to prom.
Once they had that right, had no one to go with.
I'm talking about me.
I just don't understand why you want to get hysterically excited about prom, only to be utterly disappointed by the outcome.
Because I am an American!
But I'm never gonna get what I want 'cause I'm the only gay kid in this whole school.
Hi.
What about clearly gay Stuart?
Come here.
Mah!
Well, I'm starting to think he might just be "Stuart."
Maybe you could go with that barista from Rigby's Roasters.
Isn't he gay?
Are you saying that because he's the only other gay guy you know?
Yes.
What's up?
Jimmy, can you think of any gay guys Kenny can take to prom?
Oh!
What about the barista from Rigby's Roasters?
- Wasn't he gay?
- You think I'm gonna take somebody when the only thing we have in common is that we're both gay?
I think that's more important than, say, uh, you both liking tennis.
Yo!
What up, Lacey?
!
Hey, Jimmy.
You smell like eggs.
What are you doing?
You could have asked her right there.
As you can see, I'm not good off the cuff.
I have to plan it.
Yeah?
Well, I don't even have anyone to plan for.
And I'm not asking for much.
I just want love at first sight with the perfect boy and the perfect kiss and the perfect night.
May I have this dance?
Absolutely.
This is perfect.
I can never hear enough ABBA.
Wait.
Why is he still here?
Do you guys see him, too?
The Nordic twink in the hoodie?
Kenny, this is Sebastian, our new Swedish foreign exchange student.
I thought you'd want to meet him since you both play for the same team.
And I'm not talking about a sports team.
You're both gay.
Just because they're both gay doesn't mean that they want...
Shut up.
Hi!
I'm Kenny!
Can you believe we're both gay?
We have so much in common!
What?
Do you have any 2s?
Nope.
Go fish.
Did we make that happen?
I hope so.
It works!
Oh, and it's awesome!
That's up for debate.
This is gonna be the best prom-posal ever.
Lacey and Sebastian are for sure gonna say yes.
Because of a fish balloon?
No, because of a self-mobilizing fish drone.
It's gonna hover over Sebastian and Lacey, then I'm gonna pop it and it's gonna rain down Swedish fish, you know, 'cause Sebastian is Swedish.
And Lacey loves processed foods.
Prom is so over-hyped.
It's for amateurs, like Valentine's Day and New Year's.
- Mm-hmm.
- The most romantic night of your life could happen in a random parking lot on a Tuesday night.
You don't understand gay or straight romance.
I'm not sure you do, either.
Fine!
You'll see.
- How'd it go?
- Great.
I called Clive, and I told him it's not gonna work.
He took it really well, and we parted as friends.
In fact, I told him I'd help him chaperone at the prom.
Oh, my God, he's taking you to the prom.
No, he is not!
I am going as a single adult there to make sure the kids don't grope each other.
"Hey, boo.
What color is your dress for the prom?
I want my boutonniere to match"?
See, he thinks it's a date.
How can he possibly think that?
Are you sure you were clear with him when you broke it off?
I told him I'm really busy right now and I'm not in a great place and I just don't think it's meant to be.
Okay, see, what he heard is, "when things die down,
I'll be ready, so wait for me."
I need your help.
Teach me how to kill his hope.
My whole life has led to this moment.
Okay, there they are.
There they are.
Launch it.
I told you you put too many Swedish fish in the fish.
No, but the physics were right.
I calculated the trajectory.
I just need to redistribute the weight.
Sorry.
- Got it.
- Aah!
- Sorry.
Okay, go!
- Uh, hello!
Excuse me.
Coming through.
Wait, what the...?
I'm coming out of the closet!
And I'm gay for you, Sebastian.
Prom...
Question mark?
Ja.
Just when I gave him the benefit of the doubt.
Yes!
Thank you!
Damn it!
Okay, look, I feel for you, but let's get this fish moving.
I still have a chance with Lacey, okay?
Okay.
Hey, Lacey!
Wow, Devon.
That's a lot of cheese.
What do you say?
"No."
Sure!
It's processed.
That's her favorite.
Why didn't I think of that?
Because it's literally the worst idea ever.
Everyone is staring at us.
What do we do?
We melt their hearts.
Kenny, my gay brother will you go to prom with me?
Yes?
Aww.
This went exactly as we planned.
I can't believe I took on a Catholic school so I could take a same-sex date to prom, and the date ends up being my brother.
It's too sad to even write a country song about.
Look, we're sitting in the sweet spot right now.
Everyone's hopes are super-high for prom, but... but, like Shannon said, they will eventually be let down by the reality.
And that's where we swoop in, and we give Sebastian and Lacey a night they will never forget.
Maybe you're right.
I mean, Stuart is borrowing his mom's Passat, but there's no way he can sustain that level of excitement all evening.
Exactly!
And when their disappointment is at its highest, they're gonna look over and go, "whoa, who are those handsome brothers getting all Hemsworth up in the prom?"
- I'm Chris.
- I'm Chris.
- I'm Chris!
- I'm Chris!
Mm.
Smile, love birds.
This is so silly.
All right, let's go find Sebastian and Lacey.
Okay.
Vice Principal Murray,
I may have not been clear enough in our previous conversation.
I do not wish to date you today or tomorrow or any time in the future.
I will not date you here or there.
I will not date you anywhere.
Before you make your final decision...
Couldn't be more final.
...I have something to show you.
Please, meet me in my office in 10 minutes.
Uh... mm.
Give it.
Chablis?
Get out of here.
See how bad prom sucks?
You think it's gonna be the night of your dreams, and the next thing you know, a bucket of pig blood is dropping on you in front of the entire school.
I'd take Carrie's prom over ours.
I mean, Moroccan mystique?
Let's be honest.
That's just gonna look like a cost plus world market.
I'm glad I told Ethan no.
Wait, hang on.
You got asked to prom by some guy named Ethan?
He sounds amazing.
Why didn't you tell me?
There was nothing to tell.
Prom sucks.
You said it yourself.
Oh, honey, prom doesn't suck for everyone.
It just sucked for me because I didn't have a date.
Nobody wanted to go with fatty Patty.
I thought nobody asked you, and I didn't want you to feel bad like I did.
I'm happy sitting here watching "Carrie" with you.
No, honey, trust me, you don't want to be my age and regret that you didn't get dressed up and have a glamorous night with your friends and impress them with how well you do "the Tootsee Roll."
What's "the Tootsee Roll"?
It's only the most important dance of 1994.
Listen, you should go.
I guess I could pull out that junior bridesmaid's dress
- from Aunt Stacy's wedding.
- Yeah.
It used to hang on me like a bag, but I think I have the curves now to pull it off.
And you know what else boys really love?
Turtlenecks.
They don't look disappointed.
When are they gonna look disappointed?
Right now.
We're gonna make them disappointed.
We're gonna cut in.
We're gonna talk each other up.
And then you pass Lacey off to me, and I'll pass Sebastian off to you.
That's smart.
Man, you really flicker in and out, don't you?
- Yeah, I really do.
- Hmm.
- May I cut in?
- What?
The jocks are turning.
The jocks are turning.
No.
I want the Swede.
Uh...
All right.
Hi.
Excuse me, Devon.
This will take one second.
All right.
I don't know if you saw, but Jimmy looks rather dashing in his tux.
We're sort of the Hemsworths of St. Barklay's.
He's the Chris.
You know, uh, I'm not actually gay, but if I were, that fella right over there would be just my cup of tea.

Great.

Hey!
No!
- What?
What?
- No!
- Kenny, I can't see.
- No, that's not what I wanted.

Okay, that didn't work out.
All right, when do I get to dance with a chick, bro?
Right now.

Uh, I don't think you'll be disappointed.
Oh, I already am.

You can't account for chemistry.
Well, thank you.

Like 1994?
I always knew I'd love prom!
Once again, the O'Neals did what we do best...
We took an evening of disappointment and embarrassment, and we made it into a night to remember.
My family has been through a lot these last few months, and it's moments like these that give me hope that we just might be...
That's for kissing my date... whore!
That's about right.
Does our family spend too much time together?
Yes.
Yes, we do.
Aah, that Stuart has a sharp little fist.
- Hey, sorry about your kiss.
- Yeah.
Was it at least better than kissing a girl?
Oh, hell, yeah.
At this point, I would kiss anyone.
Well...
Lacey!
Oh, Lacey, hey.
I'm sorry about not kissing you earlier.
The reason I...

It's to rent a few cars, and then hit until it almost scrapped.
Then find a familiar repair shop to the opening maintenance valuation.

Good idea.
That isn't a fraud protection?
Your kid's brain is quite good.
No.
Reject.
The insurance company has always been profitable insatiable.
It's sure will not lose.
That's not!
But we are ready, boss.
rented a few
We are not yakuza anymore!
Now just a Mekada coffee shop clerk.
Heard it?
We are not members of the yakuza.

- Well, you know, too.
Boss, isn't?
As I said, it's not boss!
There're a few things I want to ask you.

Are you here for model's registration?
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Hello.
What are you doing?
Stop.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Everyone, you should back.
Model brokers pay 150,000 registration fee, is doing the hostess only.
Misunderstanding is misunderstanding.
This is the business activity.
Business activity, to maintain the old customers even if they're not work.
Everyone's efforts will not be wasted.
These experiences will be your valuable asset.
Yes!
The work of the so-called model, but it's took some free brochures, or work clothes manufacturers leaflets.
Want to step on the world fashion magazine is not a reality.
Then ask me to sleep with the construction company.
so you received a number of benefits.
That's a misunderstanding.
Misunderstanding for you, asshole.
It should direct report to the police.
But that will bring trouble to everyone who's registered.
So, I hope you immediately stop.
You are the one who will get the trouble.
What do you mean?
Those money are to be handed over to a gang organization.
I have listen too.
Which is behind a gang organization.
Hamaguchi-gumi.
Hamaguchi-gumi?
How ?
Do I should call them, or this is better?
Which one?
What the hell?
To fight it, whether I call those people?
So you are try for my bad.
- What are you doing?
Quickly, go.
I can not let him bully our boss.
I said not boss!
Is it enough step to resurrect our Medaka-gumi?
Yes.
They are the first one who're started it.
and then to fight with other groups?
If someone was injured, what you gonna do?
No.
The registered model will get into trouble.
Yes.
Otherwise, we will steal the register's and then call the police.
It's a good idea is it?
As expected, manager!
Then, you will go.
Janken!
It's janken!
It's unfair since I'm always the one who is.
It's originally you who's should go.
Janken!
Will not do it.
Scissors!
Stone!
Paper!
Scissors!
Stone...
Who the hell are you?
Is Hamaguchi-gumi?
Right.
Ride in it please.
I will.
I also wanna talk to you.
Let me go!
Do not touch me!
So, why you're searching for me?
You are not doing strange trading, right?
Ah?
I had a decent coffee shop.
'The month to put things out!
' *
So, you're yakuza.
Izumi-chan.
What is this?
You must have sell this kind of thing.
What is this?
Biscuit?
Using butter containing marijuana ingredients.
So, the original is marijuana.
Ah, but the toxicity is too low.
Also added similar to the heroin ingredients.
Similar?
The formula slightly different.
The original is this thing.
and so will you stop talking!
Now the young people are like this.
If I sell this, there is no need specialized in the Hamaguchi site sold.
Selling it online also can.
- You are selling online?
- Of course not!
But why do you do a bad trade?
I don't have!
The counterfeit model firm's president said,
There're Hamaguchi group who's support them.
Ridiculous!
Are we doing this business?
Do not know.
Not ever heard it.
Maybe you got cheated?
If you do not abide by the rules, why there are dissolution?
I said no!
This is not our!
This is what you do!
I said not!
You say what?
Manager!
Bastard!
Why you still have that thing?
Manager!
I come to pick you up!
Forget that kid on the virtue.
Bastard!
Manager-chan will back to you.
Come eat together.
120kg!
Roll aside!
Manager!
Quickly come!
My guardian came so I can go back.
This biscuit is not what we sell!
In addition you can have it!
There're maybe other groups.
To this it's not bring any good at all.
Manager.
Let's back home.
Hamaguchi, you remember me.
Often in the river where will wet the shoes. *
The night under the rain.
The moon.
in the shadow of the clouds.
Married bride.
- Hurry up!
Let's go!
- Yes!
Excuse me.
You asshole!
"To fight it, whether I can call those people."
To the Hamaguchi-gumi succession ceremony, and also these people.
Yes
The female boss taking the lead of the gang.
What?
Woman boss?
I only can see a female high school student.
It's really a high school girl.
A ridiculously child.
This is the last head of the Mekada-gumi boss.
Izumi is his niece.
When her father dies, he has been like a father to take care of her.
Her mother, died in her junior high school years.
He has been concealing his gang thing, so go to her when alone with no bodyguards.
Then, he was attacked.
Uncle!
Uncle!
Uncle!
Anyone?
Uncle!
Anyone?
Boss!
Boss!
Why not letting me follow?
!
Boss!
Hoshi Izumi-san?
Yes.
Actually,
Then, Hoshi Izumi for first time knew that Hoshi Tsuguo is yakuza.
The next ruler of the high group is the blood-inherit of the previous leader, so Izumi has inherited it.
probably because she want to avenge for her uncle.
Who the hell are you?
What are you doing?
Put the gun down!
When she said,
Hamaguchi-gumi is a group violations of the small gangs bottom line.
Crazy enough.
Be tied to the Big Brother Hamaguchi-gumi group,
Did not agree with them on the commercial street hands.
As the exchange condition, they have disbanded.
Good people do not live long life as a bad villain.
Did not expect Medaka-gumi actually disbanded.
If they do not follow the rules they may resume at any time.
Then we let them do bad.
T Taro~
Boss!
T T~
It's manager!
You, idiot!
I want to show you something.

The girl was very scared.
Is there a chance to make it's happened that way by the biscuit?
The thing that I want to build is young people's hope.
so the safe town will build up.
Talking about safe, do you know what this is?
There is one accident because of this anesthetic biscuits.
Leads the insane female high school student dead.
The accident happened a few days before.
It's a very heartbreaking accident.
I want to protect the young people who's living in this town.
The harboring of violence in the town will sweeply clean.
Good!
Thank you.
Now it's already too late!
I have been a long time reported it to the police.
But the police simply do not care!
She's right.
The police did not do anything.
Before such a tragic accident occurred,
-the police did not even intervene.
This is really okay?
I will change this town!
Good!
Thank you.
Please vote for me.
I will hardly against violence groups!
Even if the police do not move,
I will be the one!
The politicians of this era,
-just only speak some beautiful words that will not practice.
Welcome.
Thankyou for waiting.
To do like this it is too simple.
I have done it for too long.
The old man as long as scratching his self-esteem to get.. *
Stop~ Stop~
As long as scratching, it is simple.
Compared to scrape the old man or scratch is also good.
Yasui-chan.
Do not be too arrogant.
Just talk about the welfare of the elderly,
I use simple words to let everyone understand it.
The next Japan is definitely an aging society ...
You did not do as the manuscript that we prepared!
In addition to your speech, there are addition.
You are reduced to the shitty man.

Don't touch!
What's happened?
I do not have to pay the payment of each month.
As long as the thought are no longer available, do as you want. *
What do you mean?
Who are you?
Stop!
I heard a high school girl dead because of the Hamaguchi group's sold biscuits.
It's difficult, right?
You sold it but you blame on us!
The local people are considered Hamaguchi-gumi are selling it.
The police are also investigating in this direction.
Mabuchi, you bastard!
Marry a young wife is very costly.
The rise of the group is also really hard.
I heard that your leader was poisoned and fell to the ground.
Just a small disease.
I heard the rumors about you.
How?
Please do not bully me, Hamaguchi-san~
I am today, with everyone make a fortune plan.
The proportion of the population of this town, the birth rate has been out which is no one does not know it.
Of course I know.
Not after few years later, it will be the only grandfather and grandmother, you know?
Then what you wanna do?
You are developing along the national road area.
Will somebody come?
If the grandfather and grandmother, they eat medicine like drinking water and then will go to vote.
Electric.
Wheelchair.
Unlisted Stock.
All will pay for it.
It is simply a living cash.
Compared to young people completely lost.
No money and can not vote.
The old fart after how to do just have to go to underworld.
It's okay.
It's okay.
To the time before the central Shinkansen opened,
You can open a new town.
You will feel tired of it.
Dead and alive are cycle of non-stop.
What the hell you say?
You do not have to worry, it's will be alright, Hamaguchi-san.
You just like the previous president.
Do you think I would obediently do it?
You'd better figure out the situation!
I don't need your words!
You want to be swallowed up today or forced to destroy?
You have two choices.
The poor birds into the hunters's trap.*
Bow if you want the way out.
What you gonna do, Hamaguchi?

Ruin the development plan.
Why?
Hamaguchi-gumi group and Horiuchi city design company are alliance.
Catch on the development of this wave should be very profitable bar.
You think I will be satisfied?
Life will be stabilize, isn't?
Rise City Design Corporation is the use of the power of the group.
Grazing Local Town Vultures. *

The crime was framed.
We have this shop engaged in that way.
Isn't it crazy?

Yuji-san.
Continue with me will not be a good thing.
What are you saying?
So far nothing's good.
Stupid.
Don't speak.
You're free to do anything.
It's okay.
This is what I want to do.
Haruo-kun also making the dirty rice balls?
No.
Before coming here,
Every day I make soap at factory.
Factory?
Meushi Tora Factory.
The company or district office and like..
to congratulate the kind of New Year and send something.
That time, only I and my dad works, on that day.
My dad said, as long as there are soap to make, we will not hungry.
But..
I..
When my father died, I thinking..

Because this is my life.
Why do you speak at the most important place to speak out?

In fact, the soap factory closed down, he became a tramp.
I picked him up.
This guy is only in the beautification of their past friends.
It's not!
It's not?
Yuji-kun also, why did you join the group?
I used to be "chaos" at the time.
Then the former boss saved me.
Chaos?
Seems to be against the Hamaguchi-gumi.
Also drunk a lot.
Myself... want to stay here.
If I didn't meet the former boss,
I must already die now.
Only to be killed?
Because ...
Not only run over to the death,
Also was been targeted.
And drunk.
Boss..

Manager wants to live alone?
No.
I just feel like I'll give you trouble.
How could be trouble?
Did not expect manager would care about such a small matter.

The person is small for the truth.
Measure is also small.
Huh?

- It does not matter.
- I am really big.
It's true.
Really high to see.
You are really strange.
- Huh?
Small?
- Isn't strange?
Why?
Because you are big, right?
Then, do not say that..
Then, even if that measurement can be a big,
I can return to the Dragon Palace.
- Sorry, Mr. Turtle.
- What are you saying?
Silly.
- Will never go up.
- I go first.
Wait.
What are you doing?
Isn't it more undity?
To go there, you need to get on it.
Manager should sit too.
I want to sit.
Manager!
Please use this Dragon Miyagi in full compliance with Manager's size.
Look!
Just in right size!
It's too small!
The size is wrong.
Here is the sea.
We have to swim.
There are sharks.
Haruo Shark.
Dangerous.
Dangerous.
There are a lot of town being down by Horiuchi group, isn't?
Big accident still didn't happened, right?
As long as no fire or earthquake,
It will be not be found.
Drugs can also be used to separate individual differences.
It's horrible, isn't?
Yeah.
So do you find the drug head yet?
Yes.
T Taro told me the location.
T Taro?
Because he always do the T gestures.
so called T Taro.
Had to sit on the co-pilot which should be my boyfriend's.
To ride with, it's my dream.
For now, have to go to drug traffickers, torture them.
Find the shady, it is?
It's fun, right?
This is the first date so like that.
'I do not believe anyone'.
'Do you intend to take responsibility?
'.
'I'm in difficulty'.
You say your backing is Hamaguchi group?
Who the hell are you?
I'm the original Hamaguchi group member.
Would you tell the truth?
Tell the truth.
I do not want to record your groaning and shouting.
Well, start.
I always thought he was Hamaguchi group member.
Who told you to do?
His face has a scar.
He give me the biscuit to sell.
It's Seta.
Who?
An assassin.
Who would do any bad things.
Then, another things he told you?
That's only!
You can't said that I told you!
It's enough.
Let's go.
Look out!
Your back!
Bastard!
Who's the person who attack us just now?
Maybe not ours.
Here.
Let's go!
Yosh!
Found it!
Is it okay?
Here!
It's Yuji-kun's.
So the size is okay.
I'm also changing the clothes.
Okay.
The previous special festival was held here, isn't?
Yeah.
At that time, I was a child when my uncle brought me here.
He let sit on the clergy.
I see.
Since I no longer have dad,
My uncle took me to a lot of places.
My birthday gifts,
He came to school to see me in the class.
When I was admitted to high school, he was particularly happy.
My mother died when I was in the third of year, he was there for me.
But I did not know him at all.
I didn't know that he is a yakuza.
He did not want you to know it.
You know my uncle?
Yes.
But you are opponent of the fight who's against each other.
I ever have thought about working under him.
Even if the gun is aimed at him, he'll never step back.
That's how he is.
But he died because of that.
Manager!
It's trouble!
The president of Model Plus C is dead.
So, that bunch of guys too?
Pretended to be a bunch of small fry in the fight.
It's for sealing their mouth, it is?
For them, it's a decisive battle.
The sooner is better.
The evidence is also a just matter of time.
That group also come at there.
It's alright.
Let's do it, manager.
Let's do!
Today, Medaka-gumi is resurrected.
Boss!
Boss!
Let's do together!
Boss!
The success of the annexation can finally be assured!
Which urban development that can predict the crime will be reduced!
Hamaguchi!
You also have to listen to Yasui-san.
Work well!
Oi!
What the hell you are here?
Eh?
Isn't Medaka's boss of the coffee bar?
I'm the fourth generation boss of the Medaka-gumi, Hoshi Izumi.
Huh?
I'm the fourth generation boss of the Medaka-gumi, Hoshi Izumi.
Medaka-gumi are resurrected.
Everyone, please take care.
Who cares about the resurrection?
The members have to work on the site of the bar, isn't?
You know it well.
As I said, Medaka-gumi too,
Commercial street front of the station also, take care of it. *
Isn't this?
Get rid of the young people and then squeeze the money of the elderly.
Hey.
Those grandparents' medication is not effective.
Let them calmly go to paradise.
Okay?
Only that?
Planning a good land recruiting power of generation such as station for more people?
*
It's dream, you know?
Dream.
So, in order to achieve the dream, only this are not to be aware of it, right?
"His face has a scar.
He give me the biscuit to sell."
Eh?
That person.
His face has a scar, isn't?
This drug traffickers and model company president, have been killed by masked people, isn't?
That's for sealing their mouth.
There're more than that.
Such as counterfeit drugs and the production date, like that.
The actual use of public utilities construction materials, which is very different from the plan, like that.
Although the mayor, Kusakabe said that's the company president, * but in fact is the rise of the members of Horiuchi group.
Which is if the weekly magazine journalists know, will certainly be very interested in it, you know?
Hamaguchi-san?
Are you okay with this?
Just let them do whatever they want?
Miss.
When you grow up, you will understand this troubled world.
For now, eat meat for your body!
I know you will take these threats to me,
Shit.
You don't understand.
You, little shit.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
You, bastard!
Looks like you pretty do your best, right?
Counterfeit drug formulations and production date?
How can I be it so easy for you to get the data?
It's fake.
Let me go!

Take care of your parents is trouble, isn't?

Because you know he was only with her, without any weapons and bodyguards so you shot.

Take some time to rest.
You're the one who shot my uncle, isn't?
That's right.
That's why, Hamaguchi old man develop the Station Street.
You killed him for this kind of reason?
The old man asked me to do so!
Your uncle lost his life,
it's because of your presence.
That's how is the world, you know.
Give me back!
Give me back!
Soon will be dawn, you know!
Or you want to throw him here?
!
For what this guy died?
The guy shot in the store and the former boss of Mekadaka-gumi,
For what they died?
Are to protect this place.
Obviously because of you!
The command group, if not me, it will be someone else.
You want to work in the hands of that person, isn't?
For that kind of person!
You also a yakuza, you know!
If you can not forgive me, then shot!
Fire!
Toi-san!
Toi-san!
Okay!
Boss.
A few days not see you, you looks more beautiful.
Wait.

You become a feminine.

Stop it.
It's true?
Stop it.
Wait.
Stay back.
Mabuchi-kun is working very seriously.
It's okay for look forward to the personnel transfer.
The mayor said so.
So it should be no problem.
All I have to say is support for more than 70% of the City Council.
Thanks to Yasui-san for all of this.
If it's ruin, I can only be as the money remittance fraud.
Because the moment set the lines to speak.
In short, I will say good lines.
This?
Today's society?
That's right, Izumi-chan.
Maybe let you get out this street will make everyone happy.
But..
It's not 'but' you shitty kid?

You know I won't forgive you?

But I. I hate this no matter what!
Hate this!
You expect things, isn't?
I'm gonna destroy everything!
Toi-san!
Boss.
I'm okay.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Don't shoot!
I will listen what ever you want to say!
You want this guy, right?
I have the reason.
You can take advantage of my support rate of more than 70%.
I'm also.
That guy's brain is not normal!
What kind of how such a small fry who could possible changing the power generation?
This called repeat error!
Even if I die, this world will not change!
Izumi-chan!

Try to shot me.
Hurry up kill me!

You can't shot me, isn't?

Another day, I received a letter from Toi-san.
You know, Toi-san has been surrender.
So there are some acquaintances.
It's same as the Society.
Then, although there're always been that food is not good, but recently, food seems to be better, you know?
Don't it seems fun?
Also I put the remains of Yuji-kun and Haruo-kun, on uncle's grave.
Toi-san said also he also want to see,
-If he can come back alive.
That sentence is entirely redundant.
Izumi-chan.
Yo.
Izumi-chan.
Welcome back.
I'm back.
Izumi-chan.
Come play trump.
Will not.
I don't have money.
Forget the money.

Thank you!
Please give the vote to me.
Leave it to me!

I am the Minister of Communications, please support me.
And also please take care of me!
Hoshi Izumi.
Yes!
Congratulation.
"Goodbye" is not a word to signify a parting.
It's a distant promise to keep until our next encounter.
Though you say it is a longing for where your dreams are.
I say you are only trying to startle me.

For so many hours this way.

Sorry.
I never took him for the kind of guy that would let fame go to his head.
That's not what happened, and you know it.
This is my fault.
Josh wanted to mention me in that story, and I asked him not to.
I chose staying in the closet at work over going public about our relationship.
Oh, Honey, don't turn this into a civil rights struggle.

- You raise sheep?
- Yeah.
Uh, I have a small flock on my farm in the Hudson Valley.
Seriously?
How long have you been doing that?
About five years, yeah.
Right around the time people in Brooklyn began tending beehives in their fire escapes and raising chickens in coops in the backyards of their brownstones.

Yeah.
I had a vintage denim and boot business in Greenpoint and sold it all to buy a farm and a flock upstate.

I never really thought about publishing them.
And I came up here to make you think otherwise.
Okay.
What's your pitch?
People want a glimpse of a simpler life.
We are all such slaves to social media.
You live and write with a clarity of purpose most people are missing right now.
I think your story is like an American "Year in Provence."
Oh, no, no, no.
That guy went on to become kind of famous, right?
See, I don't want to become famous.
I think that's what's known as a high-class problem.
For you, maybe.
Would you at least be open to developing your essays into something more... maybe a book?
In a way, I've already written it.
Five years of my life here on the farm.
Some fairly quotidian stuff, but you're welcome to take a look.
I would love to read a copy.
You're looking at the one and only copy right here.
What if I wanted someone else to take a look?
Wherever the book goes, I go.
Understood.

You haven't told your parents yet?
They're still out of town.
Then my vagina is out of town.
Is your mouth out of town?
[upbeat pop tune]
How was dinner with the hot shepherd?
Oh, it was great until we ran into Josh and Greta.
Oh.
I definitely think they're dating.
You're not gonna start baking again, are you?
I'm happy for him.
Seeing him with a girl his own age... makes sense.
I thought the shepherd sounded perfect.
Like, off the grid, way out of town.
I am not ready to jump back into something.
And besides... it's a work thing.
You know, before Josh, you didn't have sex for, like, what, two years?
Don't let your pilot light go out again.
Just saying.
Have Sebastian sign these.
It's boilerplate for a first book.
- Oh, fantastic!
- And I also think he should be shirtless for the author's photo.
We need to look beyond the 4H Club.
Can you have him come in this morning?
Oh, I think he already left for the farm.
Without signing these?
Liza, what were you thinking?
I wasn't.
Drive up there, get these signed, and then get back here with that book.
On my way.

Nah.
I don't believe in lawyers.
And something tells me I can trust you.
Definitely.
It's a pretty standard agreement.
And we even have language in there giving you approval of the look of the actual book.
- I asked for that.

Yeah.
I think it's important it has a handmade feel to it.
I think a lot of people are going to be really touched

Got a bit banged up after work the other day...
Did you get that stump out of the ground today?
I already told you.
Dary and I are doing it Friday.
- You never told me that.
- Did too.
You gotta tell her more than once.
She's a woman, not a robot.
In all fairness, Dary, that's a two-way street.
- You know what Dad would say...
- Plant the corn.
Get her goin'.
So, how are you gonna do it?
Well, Questions McGarrity over here, we chain it up and yank it out like a loose tooth.
So, what are you gonna chain it up to?
- My van.
- Won't do.
Why?
'Cause that might be a little too punk rock, Dary.
- What's wrong with my van?
- More than a coat of paint.
- Go on.
- More than two coats of paint.
- Get after it.
- Rear end differential.
Front end differential.
Alternator.
Battery.
Doesn't matter.
She'll perform.
Well, fucking measure twice, cut once then, bud.
You boys ever had a peanut butter sandwich?
You're one end.
You're the other end.
Stick you's together and you're just stuck.
Really scraping the bottom of the yoghurt cup for that nugget of wisdom, aren't you?
You appreciate my metaphors, Katy.
That's what I appreciate about you.
Is that what you appreciate about me?
Stake about five to 10% offer over there squarely down.
Yeah.
No.
Huh?
So any other insights for us?
Uh...
Heck!
You wouldn't mind a quick heads up from a fella who's about to steam press his Calvins.
And that's your lesson for today, folks, farts always win.
That right there was an air biscuit.
That was a real ass flapper, if I do say so, myself.
Some fine colon bowling.
Some real rectal turbulence.
Wayne, you gonna weigh in on this?
Well there's nothing better than a fart.
Except kids falling off bikes maybe.
Fuck, I could watch kids fall off bikes all day.
I don't give a shit about your kids.
I wish Gail could hear that fart.
I've got a couple pals who'd appreciates it too.
Wouldn't it be kinda neat if you could like, catalog your farts?
What for?
Well, I feel like if other people could hear that crack splitter it could have a positive impact on their lives.
That may be the nicest thing everybody has ever said about me.
You should be able to keep track of and record your farts.
And your friends' farts.
Like Facebook?
Exactly like a Facebook.
Just like...
Fartbook.
Step one, we got to builds us a website.
How are we gonna fuck that pig?
I guess we gots to calls up the Internets.
Oh, yeah?
You got a phone number for the internet, Dan?
Well, I'm pretty sure they added me on Skypes a while back,
I mean, I gots to check my emails.
- Outstanding.
- Well, I have an idea, it's gonna chap a few asses but, there's a fella we know right here in town who can builds us a websites so we don't even have to calls up the Internets, you know.
- Skip that middle man.
- Right, we'll skip the middle man.
Who is...
The internet.
- Who is it, Dan?
- Um, Stewart.
Hard no.
You gots a better idea?
Better than going into business with a meth head?
One or two.
Now hold your good goddamn horses here, let's put it to a vote, those for...
- Those against...
- Get real.
Then she's bought and paid for.
Two against one.
So, driving Pete's family's out of town, he had a bit of a Texas Hold'em Tournament.
And I went over there with my second-cousins.
- Who, Garrett?
- And Jarrett.
Well, Pete gets all liquored up.
Long story short, me and the cousins, just standing there in the kitchen having a beer watching Pete hang a piss down his own basement stairs.
Then he turns the cock on himself, pisses all over his goddamn chest.
Then he falls down his own piss-soaked stairs.
What are you gonna do?
It's like, "Hey, it's your fucking house!"
But also, "Fuck!
It's your house."
So it's Facebook...
But for farts?
That's right.
- Cartoonish.
- We're in.
But, drop the "The." Just, Fartbook.
It's cleaner.
There was never a "The."
And we want 30%.
Of what?
- Amateurs.
- Money, generated from the site!
We are not gonna be making any money off the site.
Yes, we will.
Once we get enough members playing the butt trumpet, we will sell ad space and make a fortune.
Now, let's talk about marketing.
Who should we target to buy ad space on Fartbook?
Indian food.
Greek food.
Asian noodle soups.
What about ring tones?
Instead of putting your phone on silent, you put in on silent...
- But deadly.
- You are an idiot.
- He's a...
- Wait.
You're an idiot.
Is Geo-stamping farts a good idea?
Of course it is.
Popcorn, fart location, movie theater.
That's information I's wants to know!
- No.
- Why not?
'Cause it's too complicated.
It's like algebra.
Why you gotta put numbers and letters together?
Why can't you just go fuck yourself?
The kids will fucking love that shit.
Yeah, you know what else kids love, keys.
Dangling in front of their faces.
They fucking love it.
Fine.
No ads then.
Shake on 30%.
Anything down the road will be negotiated in good faith.
Beggars can't be choosers.
Meritorious!
Give us... 24 hours.
Eduardo.
We're ranking farts.
I need the algorithm.
I need the algorithm.
- How are you now?
- Hey.
- Not too bad.
Good, and you?
- Huh?
Oh.
Gentlemen.
Fartbook.
I don't...
I...
I just...
What's wrong with you?
- Seeing it all come together...
- Sort yourself out.
Here's what we've done.
I am, at this point, the only member of fartbook.
Each member will be able to upload three farts.
Each member will post a picture to their farts.
Members will then be allowed to friend request each other and accumulate audiences for their farts.
For example...
My profile.
Wanna know, that's...
That's mint.
Like the...
Little bull snort there in the middle there, Stewart.
I really like the placement of the fizzler at the end.
Thank you.
- Now, shall we sign one of you up?
- Oh!

Wait a sec.
Can I go eat a can of Chef Boyardee?
Oh!
No times.
I can farts on command.
- Okay?
- Mmm-mmm.
Ready.
Ahem, I recommend recording through a professional studio mic but the internal computer mic will work for now.
Okay, Dan.
Ready?
Go.
Oh, very nice.
Boy howdy.
Onto the second one.
Go.
- That was a winner.
- Really nice work, Dan.
- Really nice work, Dan.
- Fuck, is this awkward.
Onto number three.
No, no, no.
I can do better.
I wants to go again.
No, I think you should keep it.
No one likes a fart that sounds too staged.
Do you wanna know what?
He's right.
Like that person who just happens to have burst out laughing in every group photo they're in?
Like the camera just happened to catch that magic moment in every single one.
That like, "Say cheese."
You're not fooling me, bud.
I suggest we, um, send it out to a test audience, before it goes live.
Um...
Get some feedback.
Iron out the bugs.
Suggestions?
What about the Ginger?
Mmm...
What about Boots?
Oh, mmm, the Ginger...
You guys...
Ever heard anything about that guy fucking an ostrich?
I heard it was Boots who fucked the ostrich.
No.
The Ginger fucked an ostrich.
- Allegedly.
- Let's see...
It'd take more than one guy to fuck an ostrich.
You think they were both there?
- Like, Boots held down the ostrich?
- I suppose...
If you really wanted to get to the bottom of it...
We could find someone, someone who farms ostriches.
Who might know how they get fucked.
I don't think we need to invite them, though.
We should get the hockey players in on this.
Those d-gens would lap this right up.
Maybe get Glen.
Get the Christians on board.
Agreed.
And we should also get Katy into the fracas.
I'll talk to her.
- The fuck you will.
- Wondrous.
You talk to her, then.
We reconvene back here in 24 hours.
Oh, yes.
Go.
Hey, has Katy liked any of your farts on Fartbook?
No, you?
- Huh.
- No.
Huh.
We got a problem.
We need to talk to Katy.
- What?
- Katy.
We've summoned you here today to talk about your Fartbook profile.
- Super.
- Let's listen.
- Problem?
- Those are cat farts.
Right.
You've got a picture of your cat under each of your farts.
It's not my cat.
It's just a barn cat.
I seen a coon having sex with a barn cat on top of my truck one time, fuck.
What's the nature of that, David Suzuki?
No one cares about your cat's farts.
But look how cute they are.
Not to be impolite, but you're the only one who thinks so.
In addition, you've been updating new farts from your cat almost hourly.
Oh, that's because there's so many cute farts.
Like I can't even keep up.
We've got another problem.
Where's Glen?
Daryl, Rage Monkeys.
Daniel.
Wayne.
We've summoned you here today to talk to you about your Fartbook profile.
Allons-y.
You have no photos and no farts but are friends with everyone along for the test drive.
Hmm.
I'm not friends with everyone.
I'm not friends with Wayne yet.
But I wanna be.
It seems as though you were just cruising through Fartbook liking and commenting on everyone's farts but contributing nothing yourself.
Nothing.
I am as God made me.
Blessed with a very healthy gastro-intestinal system.
Not super farty.
What you're doing is called creeping.
Not what Fartbook is all about.
I genuinely enjoy farts.
You can't just go around creeping other people's farts.
What the truck is wrong with that?
If you continue to misuse Fartbook, we'll have to suspend your membership.
Fine.
Fine.
Fluff you then.
I have millions...
And I mean, millions of ways of hearing unlimited farts.
We're done here, Glen.
Are we though?
Are we?
I think we should pump the brakes on Fartbook.
That's a Texas-size 10-4.
Why?
It's kicking up too much dust.
We haven't even gotten into it and already folks are gettin' chapped asses.
Well, that's their problem.
Not ours.
This is our problem.
We started Fartbook so that good folks could share farts with other good folks.
That's it.
Not to creeping' farts, or spam farts...
Although, if you eat spam, you'll get good farts.
Farts should never come between the love of a man and a woman.
- It's not right.
- You don't get to 500 million farts without making a few sharts.
Exactly.
So, what are you saying?
Fartbook dies today.
Today, Fartbook is dead.
Oh.
You think so?
I'm with the fellas on this one.
It's not why we invented it.
- You invented it?
- Our idea.
We built the site.
You know, you really don't need a forensics team to get to the bottom of this.
If you were the inventors of Fartbook, you'd have invented Fartbook.
Hold your horses there.
Let's put this to a vote.
Those for closing down Fartbook, raise your hands.
Those against?
But we own 30 percent.
This isn't fair!
If you want to sit on our backs and call yourselves tall, you have every right to do so.
But don't think that we're gonna sit here and enjoy listening to you lie.
You have a bit of our attention, you have the smallest bit of our attention.
When did we ask for your attention?
The rest of our attention is back at the offices of fartbook, where my friends and I are doing things that no one on this farm, especially and including you idiots, are intellectually, creatively, artistically,
emotionally, or spiritually capable of doing.
Have I adequately answered your condescending question?
What question?
Farts!
You better lawyer up, asshole, because I'm not coming back for 30 percent,
I'm coming back for everything.
I...
I don't know what happened just now.
No...
No...
You know, I've been thinking about Fartbook...
What about it, bigshits?
I think maybe we pulled the cord too quick on that, you parachute.
I miss it too, three-point shoes.
I was on there a lot.
Too much, likely.
I was always checking it.
It was very addicting.
Except, did you ever really stop to think about one thing, did you?
Rippin' farts into your computer doesn't exactly spike the likelihood of having sex with girls.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
- Not now.
Need 20 minutes.
- Okay.
Just wanted to let you know that Glen stole our website.
It's been live for more than 36 hours.
Hey!
Hey!
Fuck it!
Oh!
Fuck's sake.
Jesus!
Fucking sort yourselves out.
Cheese and rice.
I can't remember the last time five men came in this church so aggressively.
Or can I?
You stole our idea.
I did not steal anything.
Look, y'all had a good idea, all right?
You had a terrific idea.
Congratulations.
But did you actually think you were the only ones in the world to have it?
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about Fart culture, Stewart.
It's all the rage.
It's everywhere.
Glen will show you.
Here.
Here's the one I like the best.
It's called Fart Filter.
And I like it because you can put different filters on all of your farts and it's fun.
So, yeah, I'll just show you how it works.
This one, no filter.
Nothing.
Who cares?
Not Glen, right?
Vanilla.
Pedestrian...
However, shove that baby through the Hudson filter...
Now there's a renovation.
Now suck on your Sutro filter...
Now boys,
I'm gonna play you the filter that I invented myself.
I call it...
Valencia.
It's out there, boys.
It's happened.
The idea lives in the world.
Y'all are too slow.
Slow on the uptake.
Sad story.
Boo-hoo.
Toot-toot!
- Go away.
- Let's go.
Sad face, sad face, angry face.
Better slow down there, Big-shoots.
Tomorrow's gonna be a great day for hay.
If you can be a man at night, you can be a man in the morning.
Wayne, how come you didn't join Fartbook?
'Cause you're not supposed to fart in front of girls.
What?
There's certain things that should stay sacred between a man and a woman.
So, all things considered, this whole thing's pretty fucking juvenile, if I do say so myself.
If she's always listening to your ass acoustics, or even worse, smelling' 'em,
I guarantee she'll be slower and slower to crawl into bed with you at night.
What you just said is outrageous.
No it isn't.
It's true.
I don't wanna be smelling a dude's ass all the time.
Get real.
What are you?
Some kind of fart purist?
So what are you supposed to do?
Just hold it in?
Or take a shit, you fuckin' degenerate.
I don't know why you guys need everybody knowing your business anyway.
Like why you gotta put everything on the internet, while you're doing it, or after you're done doing it?
Well, if you don't puts it on the internet, how's gonna people know what you did?
Do you wanna know what?
That's your problem right there.
Should be playing your cards close to your chest.
Keep the ladies guessing' a little bit.
- Be the mystery man.
- Right again.
Oh, if a woman's not gonna love me for my farts or for me posting my bowling scores on the internet...
Not really sure I want one.
Well, then it's a good thing you's two have each other.

- Now, shall we sign one of you up?
- Oh!
- Me.
Me.
Me.
Me.
Me.
Me.
Me.
- Me.
Me.
Me.
Me.
Me.
Me.
Me.
Me...
- Daryl.
- Oh, fuck.
Shit.
Cunt.
Fuck...
Wait a sec.
Can I go eat a can of Chef Boyardee?
Oh!
No times.
I can farts on command.
(CHUCKLING) (GRUNTING)
- Okay?
- Mmm-mmm.
DAN:
Ready.
Ahem, I recommend recording through a professional studio mic but the internal computer mic will work for now.
Okay, Dan.
STEWART:
Ready?
Go.
(DAN FARTING)
Oh, very nice.
Boy howdy.
Onto the second one.
STEWART:
Go.
(DAN FARTING)
- That was a winner.
- DARYL:
Really nice work, Dan.
- Really nice work, Dan.
- Fuck, is this awkward.
Onto number three.
(GRUNTS)
(SHORT FART)
No, no, no.
I can do better.
I wants to go again.
No, I think you should keep it.
DARYL:
No one likes a fart that sounds too staged.
Do you wanna know what?
He's right.
Like that person who just happens to have burst out laughing in every group photo they're in?
Like the camera just happened to catch that magic moment in every single one.
That like, "Say cheese."
You're not fooling me, bud.
STEWART:
I suggest we, um, send it out to a test audience, before it goes live.
Um...
Get some feedback.
Iron out the bugs.
Suggestions?
What about the Ginger?
Mmm...
What about Boots?
Oh, mmm, the Ginger...
You guys...
Ever heard anything about that guy fucking an ostrich?
I heard it was Boots who fucked the ostrich.
No.
The Ginger fucked an ostrich.
- Allegedly.
- Let's see...
It'd take more than one guy to fuck an ostrich.
You think they were both there?
- Like, Boots held down the ostrich?
- WAYNE:
I suppose...
If you really wanted to get to the bottom of it...
We could find someone, someone who farms ostriches.
Who might know how they get fucked.
I don't think we need to invite them, though.
We should get the hockey players in on this.
Those d-gens would lap this right up.
Maybe get Glen.
Get the Christians on board.
Agreed.
And we should also get Katy into the fracas.
I'll talk to her.
- The fuck you will.
- Wondrous.
You talk to her, then.
We reconvene back here in 24 hours.
(FARTING SOUNDS)
(FARTING CONTINUES)
- Oh, yes.
- (FARTING)
Go.
(FARTING)
(FART RECORDINGS PLAYING)
(CAT FARTING)
Hey, has Katy liked any of your farts on Fartbook?
No, you?
- Huh.
- No.
Huh.
(BOTH PANTING)
We got a problem.
We need to talk to Katy.
- What?
- STEWART:
Katy.
We've summoned you here today to talk about your Fartbook profile.
- Super.
- Let's listen.
(FART RECORDINGS PLAYING)
(FART RECORDINGS PLAYING)
(FART RECORDINGS PLAYING)
- Problem?
- Those are cat farts.
Right.
You've got a picture of your cat under each of your farts.
It's not my cat.
It's just a barn cat.
I seen a coon having sex with a barn cat on top of my truck one time, fuck.
What's the nature of that, David Suzuki?
No one cares about your cat's farts.
But look how cute they are.
Not to be impolite, but you're the only one who thinks so.
In addition, you've been updating new farts from your cat almost hourly.
Oh, that's because there's so many cute farts.
Like I can't even keep up.
We've got another problem.
Where's Glen?
Daryl, Rage Monkeys.
Daniel.
Wayne.
We've summoned you here today to talk to you about your Fartbook profile.
Allons-y.
You have no photos and no farts but are friends with everyone along for the test drive.
Hmm.
I'm not friends with everyone.
I'm not friends with Wayne yet.
But I wanna be.
It seems as though you were just cruising through Fartbook liking and commenting on everyone's farts but contributing nothing yourself.
(WHISPERS) Nothing.
I am as God made me.
Blessed with a very healthy gastro-intestinal system.
Not super farty.
What you're doing is called creeping.
Not what Fartbook is all about.
I genuinely enjoy farts.
You can't just go around creeping other people's farts.
What the truck is wrong with that?
If you continue to misuse Fartbook, we'll have to suspend your membership.
Fine.
Fine.
Fluff you then.
I have millions... (CHUCKLES) And I mean, millions of ways of hearing unlimited farts.
We're done here, Glen.
Are we though?
Are we?
I think we should pump the brakes on Fartbook.
That's a Texas-size 10-4.
Why?
It's kicking up too much dust.
We haven't even gotten into it and already folks are gettin' chapped asses.
Well, that's their problem.
Not ours.
This is our problem.
We started Fartbook so that good folks could share farts with other good folks.
That's it.
Not to creeping' farts, or spam farts...
Although, if you eat spam, you'll get good farts.
Farts should never come between the love of a man and a woman.
- It's not right.
- You don't get to 500 million farts without making a few sharts.
Exactly.
So, what are you saying?
Fartbook dies today.
Today, Fartbook is dead.
Oh.
You think so?
I'm with the fellas on this one.
- It's not why we invented it.
- (SCOFFS)
- You invented it?
- Our idea.
We built the site.
You know, you really don't need a forensics team to get to the bottom of this.
If you were the inventors of Fartbook, you'd have invented Fartbook.
Hold your horses there.
Let's put this to a vote.
Those for closing down Fartbook, raise your hands.
Those against?
But we own 30 percent.
- This isn't fair!
- (YELLING INDISTINCTLY)
If you want to sit on our backs and call yourselves tall, you have every right to do so.
But don't think that we're gonna sit here and enjoy listening to you lie.
You have a bit of our attention, you have the smallest bit of our attention.
When did we ask for your attention?
The rest of our attention is back at the offices of fartbook, where my friends and I are doing things that no one on this farm, especially and including you idiots, are intellectually, creatively, artistically,
emotionally, or spiritually capable of doing.
Have I adequately answered your condescending question?
What question?
(SCREAMS) Farts!
You better lawyer up, asshole, because I'm not coming back for 30 percent,
I'm coming back for everything.
I...
I don't know what happened just now.
(WHIMPERING)
(WHISPERING) No...
No...
DAN:
You know, I've been thinking about Fartbook...
What about it, bigshits?
DAN:
I think maybe we pulled the cord too quick on that, you parachute.
I miss it too, three-point shoes.
I was on there a lot.
Too much, likely.
I was always checking it.
It was very addicting.
Except, did you ever really stop to think about one thing, did you?
Rippin' farts into your computer doesn't exactly spike the likelihood of having sex with girls.
STEWART:
Hey!
(BOTH PANTING)
Hey!
Hey!
- Not now.
Need 20 minutes.
- STEWART:
Okay.
Just wanted to let you know that Glen stole our website.
It's been live for more than 36 hours.
Hey!
Hey!
Fuck it!
- WAYNE: (EXCLAIMS)
- Oh!
Fuck's sake.
Jesus!
- (GROANS)
- Fucking sort yourselves out.
GLEN:
Cheese and rice.
I can't remember the last time five men came in this church so aggressively.
Or can I?
You stole our idea.
I did not steal anything.
Look, y'all had a good idea, all right?
You had a terrific idea.
Congratulations.
But did you actually think you were the only ones in the world to have it?
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about Fart culture, Stewart.
It's all the rage.
It's everywhere.
Glen will show you.
Here.
Here's the one I like the best.
It's called Fart Filter.
And I like it because you can put different filters on all of your farts and it's fun.
So, yeah, I'll just show you how it works.
This one, no filter.
Nothing.
(FART RECORDING PLAYING)
Who cares?
Not Glen, right?
Vanilla.
Pedestrian...
However, shove that baby through the Hudson filter... (FART SCALING UPWARD)
Now there's a renovation.
Now suck on your Sutro filter... (DISTORTED FART RECORDING)
(EXCLAIMS)
Now boys,
I'm gonna play you the filter that I invented myself.
I call it...
Valencia.
(FART RECORDING PLAYING)
It's out there, boys.
It's happened.
The idea lives in the world.
Y'all are too slow.
Slow on the uptake.
Sad story.
Boo-hoo.
Toot-toot!
- Go away.
- (HOARSELY) Let's go.
GLEN:
Sad face, sad face, angry face.
(FART RECORDING PLAYING)
Better slow down there, Big-shoots.
Tomorrow's gonna be a great day for hay.
If you can be a man at night, you can be a man in the morning.
Wayne, how come you didn't join Fartbook?
'Cause you're not supposed to fart in front of girls.
What?
There's certain things that should stay sacred between a man and a woman.
So, all things considered, this whole thing's pretty fucking juvenile, if I do say so myself.
If she's always listening to your ass acoustics, or even worse, smelling' 'em,
I guarantee she'll be slower and slower to crawl into bed with you at night.
What you just said is outrageous.
No it isn't.
It's true.
I don't wanna be smelling a dude's ass all the time.
Get real.
What are you?
Some kind of fart purist?
So what are you supposed to do?
Just hold it in?
Or take a shit, you fuckin' degenerate.
I don't know why you guys need everybody knowing your business anyway.
Like why you gotta put everything on the internet, while you're doing it, or after you're done doing it?
Well, if you don't puts it on the internet, how's gonna people know what you did?
Do you wanna know what?
That's your problem right there.
Should be playing your cards close to your chest.
Keep the ladies guessing' a little bit.
- Be the mystery man.
- Right again.
Oh, if a woman's not gonna love me for my farts or for me posting my bowling scores on the internet...
Not really sure I want one.
Well, then it's a good thing you's two have each other.

You're back?
Sorry, I...
You should've called.
I would have come to get you.
Staying for dinner?
Any news from the police?
They say the investigation's ongoing, that it's normal for it to take time.
Normal?
So you think it's normal now?
They've contacted the French police, who are going to cooperate.
We have to be patient.
It was an accident, Diane.
May I?
You wouldn't have asked, in any case.
Does it still work?
I should've cancelled the contract months ago.
I just can't.
I tried to call you I don't know how many times.
- You just disappeared...
- I was away.
Heard anything new from the police?
- You know it was a woman driving?
- What?
A blonde.
There were two of them in the car, but the woman was driving.
The man was in the passenger seat.
I went to see the bus driver, the main witness.
He said the car was big, like a BMW or a Mercedes.
He wasn't too sure about the color.
Said it was brown-ish.
That's all?
He said it had twin headlights.
It wasn't easy, but I found four cars between Lugrin and Evian.
They're not really brown, but similar, coffee-coloured.
I need to check them out.
No, that's not necessary.
It's not proof.
It's just a few leads.
And what do you think of them?
I think to be sure, we need to find the car.
FOR SALE
Hello.
Is it yours?
No, I was just looking.
Hello, I was calling about the car for sale.
I'll call back.
I'm just asking you to go and see the bus guy and show him the photos.
That's right.
Call me back when you've spoken to him.
OK.
Dad
Michel...
Are you looking for anything in particular?
No, no.
I was looking at moisturising creams.
It's for the circles under my eyes.
Exhaustion?
Follow me.
You should try this.
It's made with Japanese algae.
We can't boycott them over Fukushima, can we?
Do you do make-up?
Of course.
Is it for a special occasion?
I just feel like a change.
Well, it's for a wedding.
But I'd like to try it out first.
I'm all yours.
Where are you from?
You don't look familiar.
- I'm Swiss.
- Are you staying here for a few days?
I don't know yet.
And what do you do?
In terms of work?
I'm writing a book.
I'm a writer.
Really?
What kind of books do you write?
Love stories?
And you?
Me?
Do you ever go to Lausanne?
It's the Swiss who come here.
They buy their meat here, where it's cheaper.
Have you worked here long?
I started when I was 19.
My boss retired in '89.
I took out a loan and bought her out.
And I worked like mad.
I'm a self-made woman.
You're pretty unusual.
Why do you say that?
Because usually I'm the one who does the listening.
That little idiot...
Be right back.
Delphine?
Where's my lipstick brush?
Wednesday 25th March.
Is there a problem?
I suddenly got cramp.
Not bad, huh?
I've still got a bit of blusher to apply.
Don't you like it?
It's... it's perfect.
If you don't like it, we can try something else.
No, no, it's fine.
But I have to go.
I'll pay the bill now.
Is this your car?
Hello.
Was it you who called?
Sorry, it's sold.
I'm sorry to be so insistent.
How much were you offered?
A little less than the asking price.
I might be able to offer more.
It's a fine car.
How old is it?
It's an SL, 1972.
A pretty rare model.
Can I try it out?
- Now?
- Unless it's inconvenient.
You're right.
You have to test-drive a car!
You OK?
You put it in D, and it moves forward automatically.
Do you work at the Spa?
I give fitness lessons.
Anything related to well-being.
So what do you think?
Not bad, huh?
It might not seem much, but it's powerful.
Needs taming.
You seem to really love this car.
Why are you selling?
My partner doesn't like driving it any more.
We've ordered something smaller, a Golf.
It makes her feel more comfortable.
Accelerate a bit to check it out.
Was the car in an accident?
I saw some work had been done on the front.
It's just a bit of touching up.
Touching up?
Yes, well, just a bit.
But it's fixed now.
Do you have the bills for the repairs?
I should be able to find them.
In any case, there's already someone else who's interested.
I'm seeing him again this evening.
Shit!
- I'm so sorry.
Really I am.
- Couldn't you be more careful?
If you get an estimate, I'll pay you for it.
Or you could sell it to me.
So did he recognise the car?
He said it looked similar.
OK, so he's not going to stick his neck out.
I saw her.
She runs a beauty salon.
I checked her diary.
She wasn't in Evian on March 25th.
I also saw the car.
It's them.
It's all there.
We'll have to get it examined.
If it's the one, you've got them.
Want me to check?
I don't know.
I need to think it over.
Know where I can find what I asked you about?
Diane, it's me.
Open the door.
Open the door!
Sorry.
- Looks can be deceptive.
- What?
The lake seems calm, but it's more dangerous than it looks.
There's been quite a few drownings here.
It's the Customs.
Don't move.
Hello, it's Hélène Roy, about the car.
Can you call me back?
Wait!
I wanted to thank you.
For what?
Fancy a drink?
Yeah.
You on holiday?
What about you?
Oh, no.
I'm a local.
Isn't it obvious?
I'm Vincent.
Are you by yourself?
Are you trying to pick me up?
It was you who invited me for a drink.
I'm just interested, that's all.
Do you cross the lake often?
It's one way of making a living.
You can find anything in Switzerland.
- Is it lucrative?
- Not bad.
Especially the surprises.
Another?
Yes.
Thanks.
I wanted to...
I've a favour to ask you.
I'm looking for something.
What is it?
You still want it?
What are you going to do?
Do you know how to use it?
I'll manage.
Will I see you again?
Mum?
Is that you?
I didn't think you'd come back.
I'm sorry.
I had an anxiety attack.
That's artists for you.
You're all so sensitive.
A bit like barometers.
That stuff about a wedding was nonsense, wasn't it?
Yes.
It was a stupid thing to say.
I needed a bit of TLC and...
- I was ashamed of coming here.
- You're right to come back.
We're all looking for the same thing.
A bit of attention.
Do you have children?
A daughter, yes.
And you?
I thought you did.
You have that maternal look.
By choice?
What does your daughter do?
Nothing.
She's finding herself.
Result:
She's just bumming around.
Look.
This colour is really not bad.
It's rejuvenating.
How do you feel?
Well, a bit nervous.
What are you going to play?
Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata.
You really like that one?
It wasn't my choice.
Apparently it's popular...
Adrienne Beaumont, please.
Nothing to say?
Good luck.
Now the last movement.
Come on.
All the way, Mireille.
That's it.
That's good.
Well done.
See you next time.
Goodbye.
I didn't expect to find you here.
I've been watching you.
You really put them through the wringer.
I wanted to apologise again, about the car.
Why didn't you call me back?
Is the guy buying it then?
He's hesitating, but I think he'll take it.
He's just trying to haggle on price.
- The repair will cost 1,500.
- I'll pay for it.
That's what I told him.
He asked for 24 hours to think about it.
I'll pay your asking price.
It'd be a lot simpler if you just sold it to me, wouldn't it?
Do you want to join in?
I haven't paid.
Don't worry.
The first session is free.
Shoulders down.
Relax the neck.
That's good.
Careful.
That's it.
And relax.
That's great.
Just lengthen a bit.
There you go.
Excellent.
I can't believe you'd rather sell the car to some guy.
You never give up, do you?
I like the car.
I can pay more.
12,000?
And you'll pick it up as soon as we have the new one?
It'll be in a day or two.
You're too far away.
You have to be really close.
5 metres.
No more.
If not, you won't get anywhere.
Stand there.
Relax your shoulders.
Hold out your arm.
That's it.
Put your left hand here.
You're all set.
Put it away.
Let's go.
Hello.
Oh, hello.
I wasn't expecting...
What are you doing here?
The same as you, it seems.
You know, Evian's a small place.
It's difficult not to bump into each other.
I can't make up my mind.
Are you planning just to walk, or something more strenuous?
Do you know le Pic des Mémises?
I love that walk.
Does it get crowded?
Hiking in the middle of a crowd isn't really my thing.
There are a lot of little trails that are quieter.
Really?
When I was younger I wore these.
But now...
They don't really suit me.
Don't look at me like that, it's embarrassing.
Stop it.
You're very pretty.
Hasn't anyone told you?
You still look great for your age.
You're so nice.
How old do you think I am?
Go on, tell me!
I don't know.
You don't dare, huh?
Maybe that's why you write.
You don't dare in real life.
Ah, there's my daughter.
Élodie, this is...
What is your name?
Hélène.
A client.
- Are we going?
I'm late.
- I have to go too.
Where are you staying?
At the Savoy.
Why?
It's just that Michel, my partner, has a little house he rents out.
It's simple but very pleasant.
You'd have peace and quiet for your writing.
Would you like to see it?
I don't know.
You could take her, couldn't you?
Tomorrow, afternoon, 2:30?
- Elo?
- OK.
That's settled.
See you soon.
Good evening, Mrs Le Roy.
What's going on?
Nothing.
I'm taking a rest.
Stop it.
Come with me, we're going home.
Look...
There's a restaurant down the street by the lake.
Get a table.
I'll join you there when I've changed.
Be right there.
Simon, this is Vincent.
Hello.
Who's he...?
Sit down, Vincent.
Come on.
A toast.
Sit down.
Diane, this is just ridiculous.
To this impromptu dinner!
We're leaving.
Please.
We have to go.
Come with me.
- Leave her.
- Get off me!
- Please.
- Leave her.
Keep out of it!
What are you doing?
Stop it!
Leave him alone!
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Here.
Thanks, Vincent.
I feel relaxed with you.
I'm your fool.
Was that your husband?
Yes.
Well, he was.
I have to go.
I know why you're here.
Your detective called me.
He told me you were in Evian.
What does it change, being here?
It won't bring him back.
- You just have to accept it.
- Accept what?
You're the one who should be here instead of me.
I'm doing this for Luc.
And for us.
You're doing this for yourself.
Let the cops do their job.
Stop being so reasonable.
They've had time to do their job already.
I've found them.
And what are you going to do?
I want to talk to them.
Make them see me.
Make them see his mother.
Make them realise.
We have to tell the police.
Don't make me do it.
You remember when I disappeared the night before the medical exams?
And you laughingly said that I do absolutely anything.
And that's what you liked most about me.
All I'm asking, Simon, is that you trust me.
And not to call the police right now.
You really freaked me out!
I'm sorry, I was distracted.
Turn right.
Is it far?
Around 15 minutes away.
Are you planning to stay long?
I don't know...
A week or two.
It's not that well insulated.
It's often cold.
There.
It's pretty here.
It must be peaceful.
It's your little den, is that it?
Yes.
You don't really want me to come here.
Don't worry.
It's too remote for me.
I'd be scared of getting depressed here.
It's lovely, though.
It must be cool living here, at your age.
Or not.
Come on!
It's great once you're in!
Ever wanted to work with your mother?
Are you joking?
Dealing with a bunch of old women who want to stay young!
I guess when you put it like that...
Living here is like death.
There's nothing.
Just one shitty nightclub.
Do you want to leave?
I'm off as soon as I can.
I want to go to Paris.
But my mother... she just doesn't get it.
She's always been a bit heavy-going, but for a while now it's been hellish.
It's good to just take off.
You're right.
Shoulders down.
Breathe calmly.
5 metres.
No more.
Yes, but...
Hello, Helene.
Hello.
- So?
What about the house?
- A bit too isolated for me.
I think I'd be scared to be alone at night there.
- To each their own fears.
- Going for lunch?
Sure you don't want anything else?
It's on me.
No, thanks.
I got you this.
- You shouldn't have...
- I wanted to.
Thank you, they're...
Very pretty.
- Just my style.
- Yes.
Try them on.
What?
Have I done something wrong?
It's just I find all this so bizarre.
What do you mean?
Your being so nice, your present, all your questions...
You know, I might well not be as nice as I seem.
I'm sure you don't always feel all smiles.
But I don't mind.
What are you playing at?
Nothing.
It's not as if I know a lot of people around here.
What do you think of her?
My daughter.
She's young.
She's got chutzpah.
She's being difficult.
She can be so unpleasant to me.
Teenagers are like that.
Would you like to go for a hike sometime?
I don't know.
I usually go walking by myself.
The forecast's good for tomorrow.
OK, then.
The registration documents.
Would you mind taking me home?
Sure.
Is this the right way back to your house?
I don't feel like going home straight away.
Where are you going?
Somewhere worth the detour.
What are you doing?
I'm wondering why you've fought so hard for this car.
I was clumsy.
You were so insistent about the car, I thought that...
Luc...
I see you everywhere.
I just wanted to hear your voice.
I miss you.
You can't imagine how much I miss you.
This is Luc.
Leave a message, maybe I'll call you back.
How's your novel coming along?
Well.
May I confide in you?
Of course.
I've based one of the characters on you.
Ah, so that's what it's all about!
What what's all about?
All those questions!
Does it bother you?
Tell me if it bothers you.
I don't think so, no.
It doesn't bother me.
It's just a bit new to me.
I'm not the baddie, I hope?
The baddie is a bitch.
A real bitch.
It's a shame you didn't like the house.
It's got so many good memories.
It's where I used to go with my partner, at first.
I felt like a teenager.
And what about you?
Do you live alone?
I'm separated.
It's been 6 months now.
I admire couples who are able to stay the distance.
Are you married?
Been there, done that!
Shall we sit down?
He left when our child was two.
What's your partner's name?
Michel.
You get on well?
Yes.
Well... it's not always easy.
He's 13 years younger than me.
And that makes it complicated.
Sometimes I wonder if he's seeing somebody else.
You know what I did?
One evening I went through his mobile.
I didn't find anything.
That's what was really weird.
There was nothing at all.
I imagined him deleting every single text.
Every call.
I have the feeling he doesn't want me any more.
He must have someone else.
You can try all kinds of things, but a day comes when...
The desire has gone.
I'm losing him.
You OK?
Yes.
I don't think I can go any further.
Would you mind if we went back?
Ah, I'm so pleased you've come.
I didn't think you would.
A glass of champagne?
- Are you OK?
- I know it's you.
What do you mean, it's me?
Ah there he is!
I hadn't ordered enough champagne!
So...
Michel, Helene.
Helene, Michel.
Hello!
How are you?
What...
Do you two know each other?
Should I put these over there?
I hope you're proud of yourself.
All those questions, it was just sick curiosity about the stupid bitch!
You're not wearing my earrings.
I hardly ever do.
My son didn't like me wearing jewellery.
- What, your son?
I thought...
- He's dead.
He was run over 7 months ago.
I know it was you.
What are you talking about?
You're completely crazy!
You're talking nonsense.
You know what?
Leave here right now.
Get out!
The boy you ran over in Lausanne.
That was my son.
What?
A bus driver saw you.
Look.
Look familiar?
You're mistaken.
I've never run anyone over.
We've got nothing to do with this.
You think we wouldn't have stopped?
When was it?
I haven't been to Lausanne for two years.
25th March.
A Wednesday.
He was coming out of the Conservatory.
25th March?
25th...
Look here, -
- I was in Paris on the 25th.
A training course at L'Oréal.
You can ring them if you don't believe me.
Go on.
Ring them.
The woman, she was blonde.
It was your car.
I'm telling you it wasn't me.
I was in Paris.
And what about him?
Michel.
Wasn't he there?
You're talking nonsense.
And anyway...
When you find the people who did it, what difference will it make?
What was your son's name?
Luc.
I'm sorry about what happened.
But we've got nothing to do with it.
So please get out of my life.
- You think only of yourself!
- Stop acting like a kid!
I need to know.
You were with your stepfather on 25th March.
In Lausanne.
Your mother wasn't there.
You were.
It was you, wasn't it?
It was you...
You know who I am?
- You know who I am?
It was you!
- I didn't see him.
I didn't see him!
There was the bus.
I wasn't speeding, the light went red.
I didn't see him, I swear.
There was a noise against the car.
I can't stop thinking about it.
At first, your son got up.
I didn't want to just drive off like that.
But Michel told me not to stop, to just keep driving.
So I did.
Your son's destroyed my life.
I didn't mean to.
It's Michel.
He'll be here in a minute.
I was scared.
I called him.
Get out of the car!
Even if it's just a dog, you stop.
Leave, now.
Get out!
I don't know what to say.
I had no idea.
Is Élodie at home?
She's making a statement.
She wants to forget.
You know, -
- I'd have done like you.
I was on the phone to him when it happened.
My name is Diane.
Hello.
You know who I am?
Yes.
- Got a minute?
- Yes.
I didn't know about you.
Luc was secretive.
We played in the orchestra together.
It's Bach you're rehearsing?
The Concerto in F Minor.
We're performing in two weeks at the Stravinski Auditorium.
Luc filmed you at your audition.
That's how I saw you.
We were together a lot.
Sometimes, I'd get home late.
My father would yell at me.
It's just that we were hanging out together and then I'd miss the bus.
I've got something to show you.
It's the Rieding Concerto.
What are you going to play?
- The Rieding Concerto.
- In B minor?
Jeff:
Last night, our tournament kicked off with the good...

Matthew almost won this contest last year.
Mike Lawrence writes for "Inside Amy Schumer."
He gets residuals for being the third guy from the left on the evolutionary chart.
Let's get to the rules.
Three rules in "Roast Battle."
First rule -- nothing's off-limits except for physical contact.
Second rule -- original material only.
Third rule -- at the end of every battle, we hug each other!

was actually based on the last time he tried to floss.

All right, I think we should go one Sudden Death joke.
-Yes!
-Okay.

Go ahead, buddy.
-Again?
Damn it, Jeff.
-Yeah.
All right, are we ready for this?
Joke-off!
Let's roast!
[ Bell dings ]
All right.
I actually heard Tony hit his ex-girlfriend a few times.
Yeah.
No charges were brought up 'cause honestly, it's a fair fight.
[ Applause ]
That is -- That is a bold accusation.
I have never hit a girl, however,
I am about to beat a pussy right now.

That's -- That's one joke each.
-That was amazing.

You want to say something, Anthony?
Again, you guys were both so good.
It's like you're just barely different shades of plaid.

So funny.
So funny.
-Observational.
-And I've actually --
Mark, I've actually seen Tony hit his girlfriend.
So I know what you mean.
But the fact that Tony came back at it off the cuff... congratulations, Tony.
Had to go first.
You're welcome, Tony.
Okay?
Great comeback.
And I thought that shit was funny.
You're welcome.
-Thank you, Whoopi.
This floor looks like Tony's back.
Oh, hey.
[ Laughing ] Oh!
Tony:
Very good.
Very good.
Eh.

Thank you.
This was one of the best battles that we've had in the last couple days.
I'll say that, for sure.
Mark Normand, you're fucking hilarious, dude.
I think you're gonna be one of the biggest comics in the country.
I really do.
-It's true.
And I'll just put it out there.
For whatever it is, you might be my favorite comic that's working today.
I love your shit, dude.
-Wow.
Geez.
Thanks.
All right.
Tony, you look like a boy scout who sells girl scout cookies.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I love you to death.
Your Uber joke was my favorite joke of the battle.

HUDSON:
About six months ago,
I was approached by the intelligence department of the Casa de Contratación.
They offered me a significant amount of money.
I said yes.
The department's spies had learned of an attempt to walk away with their money without them knowing of it.
If you do not return the entirety of the hidden cache, know that Nassau will likely burn for it.
With everything I've lost in recent days,
I can't afford to lose the name, too.
We walk into the tavern, we sign our names, and then not only are we square with the law our money is, too.
The wound should be far further along towards quietening itself.
If the decay progresses,
I'll have to remove more of your leg.
What does a colonial power do when they see a sitting governor deposed by an alliance of pirates and slaves bring down Nassau?
Maybe bring it all down.
What happens now?
Now we go find Charles Vane.

Don't imagine that will be the last of those.
Neither do I.
So how exactly do you see this working?
They have their orders.
As long as we hold our end of the bargain, they'll hold.
Yeah, that wasn't what I meant.
I understood a war meant to antagonize England to frighten them, to prevent them from moving against Nassau.
But that isn't what we're talking about anymore, is it?
Now you're talking about a war meant to be won.

HUDSON:
At first I was tempted, but in the end it felt wrong to betray the governor that way.
And it felt dangerous... so I declined.
Then how did this happen?
How does an honest chambermaid end up in the employ of the Spanish empire?
A few days after I declined their offer...
I came home late from the governor's service.
It wasn't unusual for me to return home to find my children long since fast asleep.
That night, my children were not alone.
The man who had approached me
Grandal... was there... waiting.
In his left hand, a knife.
In his right, a purse.
He said my children would receive something from him that night.
He asked me to choose which.
These are the people whom I am beholden to.
This is what they are capable of doing.
I cannot imagine what they will do if the cache is not returned whole.
Ship's manifest, sir.
The entirety of the gold from the fort is now stowed and ready for transport to Havana.
We should be under way within the hour.
Put it in my office, please.
I just left Miss Hudson.
I had the instinct once or twice, the way she'd been watching me of late.
I dismissed it, just assumed it related to some concern over my relationship with you and its becoming inappropriate.
What did she say?
Did she report that we're earnestly attempting to find and return the missing money?
It's not about the money for them, not anymore.
When the gold from the Urca was stolen, it was bad enough.
Now they hear the gold is being converted into something more easily hidden from them, more easily smuggled away.
That isn't theft.
It's an insult.
And insults to empires require answers.
So it's personal, then?
A binary question of my trustworthiness.
Either I return the full cache and prove it or I fail, and in trying to excuse the shortfall, only aggravate their existing suspicion that I am part of the pirate problem, not its solution.
And the dread fleet in Havana sets sail the very next day to raze all of Nassau to the ground.
Then we'll fight them, defend the island.
The odds would be dire, but we are not without resources.
No, not "we."
I mean, someone might fight them, but it won't be you and I.
If the result of my endeavor here is a Spanish attack against British forces, an act that threatens to drag the empire into a war,
I would be recalled to London and likely debtors' prison and your capital sentence would be reinstated.
Now, I believe Nassau's best chance at survival is with me guiding it.
But if we cannot find Jack Rackham and Anne Bonny, if we can't find the cache in their possession, whatever happens to Nassau, you and I are likely finished.
[metal clanging]
- [crowd chattering] - [chickens clucking]
Pardon me, gentlemen, if you don't mind me asking, where is this wagon headed?
To the fort.
To do what, exactly?
To fix it.

What the fuck are you doing here?

It's what respectable men wear.
It's... never mind what it is.
You're supposed to be long gone by now.
Why'd you come back?
Where we're going, it seemed better to have one of these than not.
I thought as an added prize,
I'd at least be able to see it for myself, the new governor up to his ears in the very same bullshit in which I've been drowning for the past few months.
And what do I find?
The streets are swept, industry is in fashion, you're dressed like a Turkish whore, and all because a man arrived, stood on the beach, and said please.
- You're angry.
- I'm confounded.
He offers them less in wages than I offered, demands more from them in labor, restricts more from them in license, and yet despite all of that, he's won them.
How can that be?
I know it may be hard to believe given my appearance at the moment, but the experience of it?
It ain't half bad, Jack.
Next.
Next man, please.
Your legal name?
John Rackham.
What?
The Lord Governor would like a word with you.
- [people shouting in native language] - [breathing heavily]
Watch him, please.
I'll go fetch Fremah to tend to him.
I said no.
- I know you did.
- I don't want help.
It'll pass.
I'll just find a place to weather it for the night.
I understand that you do not want anyone to see you this way.
What I don't understand is why you choose to suffer in the first place.
You must have access to better medicines than that.
We've got access to better medicines than that.
This has nothing to do with medicine.
It has something to do with medicine...
I cannot look weak.
I cannot feel weak.
I cannot be weak.
Not in front of my men.
Not in front of your men.
Not at all.
For some time now, I have been holding my entire world together with both hands, keeping my men in line, seeing to their needs, and the only way that endures is if I look the part.
And I cannot look the part while being poked and prodded or while drooling through an opium haze saying who the fuck knows what.
So I will endure this the way I have been enduring it.
No one prepared you for this, did they?
[breathing heavily]
For as long as I can remember,
I have been prepared for the day
I would take my mother's place.
To know that from that day forth,
I would forever be the one who tends as opposed to the one who is tended to.
You're frustrated.
You're angry.
You're tired.
Perhaps no one else knows why.
I believe that not even you know why.
But I know why.
The crown is always a burden... but it cannot be borne if you cannot stand.
[waves crashing]
Nearly dismasted in a storm... a storm you chased after.
Nearly starved to death in the doldrums.
Nearly executed by them.
Either you are unkillable, friend, or way overdue.
One way or another, I am here, and there is much to discuss about all our futures.
What kind of future do you propose that to be?
I intend to gather forces and move to reclaim Nassau.
The conquest is always weakest when the conqueror allows himself to believe that it is done.
For Nassau, that point is now.
Now, England may hold the island, but it still needs supplies brought in.
It is still dependent upon trade.
We will make that impossible for him.
We will harass his ships.
We will plunder his supplies.
We will force him to bleed capital and support and the goodwill of the men surrounding him until he is weak enough to challenge directly.
Until we can bring the fleet to bear and retake the bay.
You know, when I called Nassau home, most of the men on this beach weren't even men.
I sailed with Ben Hornigold.
I sailed with Sam Bellamy.
I sailed with Henry Avery.
Feuded with them, stole from them, questioned their motives, but we all knew what we were.
Then a man arrives who would explain to us that what we've been doing was wrong all those years, what Nassau ought to be, what he could make it if we would all just follow his lead.
And here you are again to do the same.
You let it go well before its time.
It was past its time.
That you cannot see this only makes it clearer to me that you never even knew it in the first place.
This fleet is all that remains of it, and as long as it's mine, Nassau shall remain in its past.
It isn't yours.
It never was.
Those ships, their commanders and crews, they were pledged to my command, not yours.
Oaths were taken, and I have come to see them honored.
Do you honestly believe that I would just step aside and let you make that claim?
I honestly don't give a shit what you would or would not do.
The decision isn't yours.
It's his.
I've come to resume our compact, the one we swore upon our lives to uphold.
If you stand up and acknowledge it, this fleet will follow us.
I'm certain of it.
- You weren't there.
- No, I wasn't.
But had I been there, there would be no question about any of this.
Had I been there, we would have mounted the defense that we had agreed to mount.
Had you been there, you would have seen their faces, the ones who laid their arms down and turned their backs on us.
The ones who took our money for months and were happy to try and deliver my head to our enemies for a little more of it.
Nassau is dead.
It doesn't deserve anything else from me or the men on this beach.
We are finally free from it, and I see no reason to change that.
If you wish to leave this place, I'll allow it, although somehow I don't think you have any intention of leaving.
No, I don't.
And I think you know that I would never allow you to call a vote to settle the matter of who this fleet follows and risk you depleting my force by luring away some misguided minority.
No, I don't imagine you would.
So we have one fleet and two men claiming it.
There is only one way I know of to resolve that.
Pistols, then swords.
Captain Rackham.
It's a pleasure to finally meet you.
Give us the room, please.
Drink?
Thank you.
I apologize for the strangeness of this meeting.
I know you and I don't know each other.
[door closes]
I know you... some.
I read your book.
Did you?
Well, most of it.
I confess, I may not quite have soldiered through to the end.
But, you know, I got the gist of it.
If you don't mind my asking, what did you take to be its gist?
Wealthy son of a wealthy man takes to the sea to prove something to the parents, presumably.
Seeks adventure, finds the limits of his own capacity.
Loses everything in the process and then stumbles upon a hell of a story in the process.
Please understand, I'm quite particular about my library, but people seem to have liked it fine, and it seems to have done wonders for you.
So congratulations on all that.
Thank you.
All of that notwithstanding... you and I share an experience in this place.
And as such, I'm hopeful that you'll understand why it is I brought you here today and what it is I'm about to ask of you.
What's that?
I know you removed a significant amount of gold from the fort.
I know it is in your possession, and I need you to give it up... or we're all dead.
- [men muttering] - [seagulls screeching]
You can't win.
[grunts]
I hear you spent weeks becalmed, deprived of food and water.
At your best, it would have been a dogfight, but diminished...
I'm not that diminished.
He's been off the account for years.
He'll be more vulnerable than he remembers himself being.
He's not that vulnerable.
And for what?
You subject yourself to certain death for an island full of weaklings and ingrates?
Those men will go where they are led.
Rogers captured their minds before you could, but let's not pretend that they can't be won again.
And let's not pretend that either of us believes for a moment that I'm doing this for their sakes.
I gave you my word.
Shook your hand.
Pledged to defend the island with you.
But my pledge to him began a long time before I ever knew your name.
- What I owe him...
- I don't care.
I don't care that you shook my hand.
I don't care what you feel you owe him.
This is too important to be clouded by any of that.
They took my home.
I can't walk away from that.
Can you?
Forget me, forget Teach, forget loyalty, compacts, honor, debts, all of it.
The only question that matters is this.
Who are you?
Spain knows about the exchanges?
They do, and they are displeased.
How do you know they know?
So what does that look like?
Return it all or it's the Rosario raid all over again?
- [pouring]
- Something like that.
I understand why you did it.
I know what it feels like to lose everything and feel powerless to do anything about it.
The temptation to keep something to show for it all,
I understand it.
But it does not change the reality we face.
That you face.
For I assure you, if Spain invades over this, yours will be the first face they see.
I heard Henry Avery's name when I was a boy, heard the way people spoke it... grown men in awe of it.
I came to this place so determined to do the same.
That's not going to happen the way I thought it was, is it?
It never does.
My advice?
You want some say in how they speak of you?
Write a book.
[laughs]
Right now, what do you want to do?
Do you have a pen?
ROGERS:
He's agreed to cooperate.
One man goes into the interior to deliver this, instructions written in his hand to his partner to return to Nassau and surrender the cache.
He said she may be wary, asked there be only one messenger to deliver the letter.
Give this to Lieutenant Hersey.
Have him prepare to depart for the interior.
I'll pass him details momentarily.
He should be made aware Anne will not be taken lightly.
Well, neither will Lieutenant Hersey.
I understand Jack was arrested today.
I would like to know why.
[crowd chattering]
- [waves crashing] - [men chattering] [seagull screeching]
[man mutters]
What happens if he loses?
If he loses, he dies.
I meant what happens to us?
I don't know.
Probably given a chance to join the fleet, fold in, and go back on the account.
When your men entreated me to join your crew, they said your captain was a man worth following.
A strong man, a wise man, they said.
But right now I can't tell which side of this contest you'd prefer to see prevail.
Can you help me make sense of that?
[men muttering]
A few days ago I could make sense of all of it.
He was going to die and we were going to be free, from the account, from him... [sighs]
With all the shit he's done, the things he's gotten away with, that would have been fair.
That would have been right.
I think part of the reason
I've been able to stand by his side is that I wanted to make sure I've got a good view of the moment the world finally catches up to him... and this story starts to make sense again.
This is a matter of honor to be settled once and for good in the here and now.
The parties have agreed to combat and have accepted common practice.
The parties have further agreed there will be no quarter asked nor given.

SILVER:
The burden I wasn't prepared for... [distant drums beating]
SILVER: it isn't the men.
It's him.
Flint?
What he wants, what he needs, what he fears... the depths of it... they are profound and dark.
I serve the crew best by tempering him, steering him where he's needed.
I've descended into those depths and connected with him so that I might be able to do so.
But I am acutely aware that I'm not the first to have been there... to have been a partner to him in this way.
And that the ones that have seen those depths before... they never surfaced again.
Maybe their mistake was in trying to do it alone.
Maybe to go to such a place, one needs another to hold the tether and to find a way out.
Maybe.
[door opens]
I know this cannot have been easy for you.
I know this is so far from how you thought things would end.
But I wanted you to know that the end of this may not quite be what you think it is.
How's that?
When Anne receives your letter and returns here with what remains of the cache,
Nassau will be secured, and everyone will know that it is because of Jack Rackham that it occurred.
I'll have spared Nassau... and you think the story of it will be told long after I am gone?
I know it will.
I will make sure of it.
Sounds a lifeless story to me, and one that requires commitments before the fact to ensure its retelling.
When the current story unfolds, I assure you, it's going to get around all on its own.
What does that mean?
I walked into this place today stunned at how quickly that man downstairs had completed his conquest, how thoroughly he had seemed to win just about everyone I know over to his side.
The truth of the matter is there's been no conquest.
It's only the appearance of one.
For conquest is an either/or proposition.
Either you have it or you do not.
It would appear that without that cache, he most certainly does not.
Jack, what did you do?
I sent word to Anne to take the cache and disappear.
No.
The governor saw your letter to her.
You don't think I can convey a thought to Anne comprehensible only to her?
A thought as simple as "run"?
A letter that said everything the governor wished it to say in exactly the way he'd want to say it would not sound like anything I'd ever say.
A thought here or two between the lines...
I assure you, she understood.
So I have begun the duel between myself and our Lord Governor.
The rules are simple.
I will deny him the cache.
No matter what sort of inducements he offers or pain he inflicts,
I will deny him the cache, and so I will deny him the victory.
And in doing so, I will ensure that whatever Nassau is come Christmas,
English will be not it.
[silent]
Do not do this.
It's done.
RACKHAM:
So, one of two outcomes will result.
Rogers will understand his defeat to be ultimately inevitable and leave this place, in which case I'll have it back.
Or he'll stubbornly refuse and eventually Spain will raze this place to the ground.
The English flag will burn, and a second pirate republic will be born from the ashes of the first.
Only this time, every man who calls it home will know it came about because of me.
- [crickets chirping] - [people chattering in native language]
I worry... that we have made a terrible mistake.
I see what you see in them...
Silver and Flint.
But their relationship is so volatile and we have put our lives in their hands.
Those men rose to their stations because they are peerless when it comes to shaping the world to their will, in creating a narrative and wielding it to compel men's hearts and minds.
But the most compelling story requires a villain at its center.
And if either Captain Flint or Mr. Silver sees the other as a villain... or worse... us as that... then all is lost.
They are of great value to us, but they must be managed by us to avoid that outcome.
How?
I wish... you and I had not been so separate all those years.
I wish I could have found a way to be a better father to you.
But over time, I was determined to leave you something behind, to give you the one thing that no one could ever take away... and that would make you strong enough to understand their world, interact with their world... wage war on their world.
But if their identity lies in their stories,
I wanted you to know them so that when we are ready to call them enemies, you would be ready for it.
The villain makes the story.
So to manage our current partners, we must ensure that we all agree at all times who our common villain is.
MAN:
The fugitive's name is Anne Bonny.
She's going for a capture of £500.
[chattering]
MAN: ... several miles away on the road out of town.
[chatter continues] [horse neighs, hoofbeats depart]
Earlier today, before we knew Rackham was still on the island, you seemed confident that we could locate him and his friend in time.
You said it was possible because they didn't know that we were looking for them.
Why do I get the feeling, now that they do know, now that they've made it their personal crusade to see this regime fail, that your estimate will be far less optimistic?
The militia will help.
It will keep the pressure on, and perhaps we'll get lucky.
But if we don't, then you may have to be prepared...
Oh, I'm prepared to do anything.
Anne Bonny must be found.
The cache must be found.
Right now, that is all that matters.
And that said, the goodwill that we have engendered among the people of Nassau is not without limits.
The longer this drags out, the riskier it becomes, because if I find that money only to lose the street...
You will not.
If you have me, then you have the street.
I am all the reassurance they need.
Yes, Jack and Anne were my partners, my friends.
More.
But now they have made themselves something else to me.
I have sacrificed too much to build something here.
I will not let them take it away.
[bell ringing]
All he ever did was offer me his friendship.
I cast him aside once, spent years regretting it.
And now here we are again.
Tell me I didn't do it for nothing.
Well, I won't lie to you.
It would have helped having the fleet.
We have assets, we have allies.
The question is what we make of them.
I may be able to help in that regard.
Something to add to our pool of assets.
Before Ocracoke, we came upon a prize... a Spanish prize ferrying a significant trove of intelligence.
Most of it was destroyed by the time we found it, but among the remains was one piece of information, something everyone else was quick to dismiss as it held no value to them in that moment.
Information about what?
Money... separated from the Urca gold within the fort and rendered into a new form... a cache of gems for which Spain is holding the new governor accountable.
A cache which, if used creatively, could be the key to defeating British forces in Nassau.
The only question is, can we find it before he does?
♪
About six months ago,
I was approached by the intelligence department of the Casa de Contratación.
They offered me a significant amount of money.
I said yes.
The department's spies had learned of an attempt to walk away with their money without them knowing of it.
If you do not return the entirety of the hidden cache, know that Nassau will likely burn for it.
With everything I've lost in recent days,
I can't afford to lose the name, too.
We walk into the tavern, we sign our names, and then not only are we square with the law our money is, too.
The wound should be far further along towards quietening itself.
If the decay progresses,
I'll have to remove more of your leg.
What does a colonial power do when they see a sitting governor deposed by an alliance of pirates and slaves bring down Nassau?
Maybe bring it all down.
What happens now?
Now we go find Charles Vane.
Where is he?
When you said that you'd be staying behind to solidify our new compact,
I assumed that meant something.
For you to be seen as uninterested in what is happening for my father now, that is not going to help convince anyone here that you are serious about desiring their friendship.
It'll pass.
It's just a fever from the wound.
I'm fine.
Christ!
I'm all right!
Swing it down on deck!
Fucking idiot!
Listen, if you can't tie a rope, you shouldn't be on this ship!
Get astern.
Calm down!
Hey!
What's going on here?
His lashing came undone.
I fucking showed it to him 10 minutes ago.
Someone could have been killed.
Then you showed him incorrectly.
It's a fucking lashing.
I know how to tie it.
If he tied it wrong, then you instructed him wrong.
You listen to me.
We persuaded them that they need us.
We most certainly need them.
Do you understand what I'm saying?
Don't imagine that will be the last of those.
Neither do I.
So how exactly do you see this working?
They have their orders.
As long as we hold our end of the bargain, they'll hold.
Yeah, that wasn't what I meant.
I understood a war meant to antagonize England to frighten them, to prevent them from moving against Nassau.
But that isn't what we're talking about anymore, is it?
Now you're talking about a war meant to be won.
You convinced them.
Convinced Scott, his wife, their people, our people, even Silver.
But not you.
Everyone's wrong but you.
Maybe.
Captain!
Masts!
Captain.
Ocracoke Island.
Teach is there.
A few hours' time, assuming he's there,
I'm going to begin a discussion in which I'm going to ask him for something that he can't possibly give.
And the success or failure of this war will depend upon the outcome.
In a few hours' time, there's a good chance you're going to look awfully smart.
What are you doing?
Bring him down!
You look good.
As handsome as ever.
You always were a gifted liar.
When you were still pirating,
I was the woman who was Blackbeard's woman.
Put my services in great demand all men wanting what notorious men already had.
And then you leave and my business fades.
It's always the little people who get hurt the worst when the market turns.
So when are you going to tell me?
Tell you what?
What he's doing here.
Charles?
I remember when he had forced you from Nassau.
I remember how angry you were, how disappointed.
And I remember you telling me that you'd never make the same mistake again, that you had learned the hard way that only God made sons.
Things are different now.
Different how?
Doesn't need to last long.
A little Spanish shrapnel.
It went in here when I was not much older than him.
Once in a while it migrates, ticks closer to reaching its terminus and striking its chime.
Grim little timepiece whose ticking has grown louder to my ears of late.
Charles doesn't know, does he?
Captain!
Jesus.
Welcome to Ocracoke.
At first I was tempted, but in the end it felt wrong to betray the governor that way.
And it felt dangerous... so I declined.
Then how did this happen?
How does an honest chambermaid end up in the employ of the Spanish empire?
A few days after I declined their offer...
I came home late from the governor's service.
It wasn't unusual for me to return home to find my children long since fast asleep.
That night, my children were not alone.
The man who had approached me
Grandal... was there... waiting.
In his left hand, a knife.
In his right, a purse.
He said my children would receive something from him that night.
He asked me to choose which.
These are the people whom I am beholden to.
This is what they are capable of doing.
I cannot imagine what they will do if the cache is not returned whole.
Ship's manifest, sir.
The entirety of the gold from the fort is now stowed and ready for transport to Havana.
We should be under way within the hour.
Put it in my office, please.
I just left Miss Hudson.
I had the instinct once or twice, the way she'd been watching me of late.
I dismissed it, just assumed it related to some concern over my relationship with you and its becoming inappropriate.
What did she say?
Did she report that we're earnestly attempting to find and return the missing money?
It's not about the money for them, not anymore.
When the gold from the Urca was stolen, it was bad enough.
Now they hear the gold is being converted into something more easily hidden from them, more easily smuggled away.
That isn't theft.
It's an insult.
And insults to empires require answers.
So it's personal, then?
A binary question of my trustworthiness.
Either I return the full cache and prove it or I fail, and in trying to excuse the shortfall, only aggravate their existing suspicion that I am part of the pirate problem, not its solution.
And the dread fleet in Havana sets sail the very next day to raze all of Nassau to the ground.
Then we'll fight them, defend the island.
The odds would be dire, but we are not without resources.
No, not "we."
I mean, someone might fight them, but it won't be you and I.
If the result of my endeavor here is a Spanish attack against British forces, an act that threatens to drag the empire into a war,
I would be recalled to London and likely debtors' prison and your capital sentence would be reinstated.
Now, I believe Nassau's best chance at survival is with me guiding it.
But if we cannot find Jack Rackham and Anne Bonny, if we can't find the cache in their possession, whatever happens to Nassau, you and I are likely finished.
Pardon me, gentlemen, if you don't mind me asking, where is this wagon headed?
To the fort.
To do what, exactly?
To fix it.
I see.
Just you two on the job, is it?
A whole gang of us up there.
Governor wants it shipshape by the end of the month.
Suppose that fort's not going to rebuild itself.
No, I suppose it won't.
Hold still.
There.
Well?
What do you think?
You mean aside from the tit curtains?
It's called a cravat.
You want to fit in with them, right?
- This is what they wear.
- "They" who?
Respectable men.
All right, yeah.
Place of birth?
Bristol.
Occupation?
Ship's carpenter.
- Ship served?
- I used to serve the Buccaneer.
Sign here.
Move on.
Next?
What the fuck are you doing here?
It's a cravat.
It's what respectable men wear.
It's... never mind what it is.
You're supposed to be long gone by now.
Why'd you come back?
Where we're going, it seemed better to have one of these than not.
I thought as an added prize,
I'd at least be able to see it for myself, the new governor up to his ears in the very same bullshit in which I've been drowning for the past few months.
And what do I find?
The streets are swept, industry is in fashion, you're dressed like a Turkish whore, and all because a man arrived, stood on the beach, and said please.
- You're angry.
- I'm confounded.
He offers them less in wages than I offered, demands more from them in labor, restricts more from them in license, and yet despite all of that, he's won them.
How can that be?
I know it may be hard to believe given my appearance at the moment, but the experience of it?
It ain't half bad, Jack.
Next.
Next man, please.
Your legal name?
John Rackham.
What?
The Lord Governor would like a word with you.
Watch him, please.
I'll go fetch Fremah to tend to him.
I said no.
- I know you did.
- I don't want help.
It'll pass.
I'll just find a place to weather it for the night.
I understand that you do not want anyone to see you this way.
What I don't understand is why you choose to suffer in the first place.
You must have access to better medicines than that.
We've got access to better medicines than that.
This has nothing to do with medicine.
It has something to do with medicine...
I cannot look weak.
I cannot feel weak.
I cannot be weak.
Not in front of my men.
Not in front of your men.
Not at all.
For some time now, I have been holding my entire world together with both hands, keeping my men in line, seeing to their needs, and the only way that endures is if I look the part.
And I cannot look the part while being poked and prodded or while drooling through an opium haze saying who the fuck knows what.
So I will endure this the way I have been enduring it.
No one prepared you for this, did they?
For as long as I can remember,
I have been prepared for the day
I would take my mother's place.
To know that from that day forth,
I would forever be the one who tends as opposed to the one who is tended to.
You're frustrated.
You're angry.
You're tired.
Perhaps no one else knows why.
I believe that not even you know why.
But I know why.
The crown is always a burden... but it cannot be borne if you cannot stand.
Nearly dismasted in a storm... a storm you chased after.
Nearly starved to death in the doldrums.
Nearly executed by them.
Either you are unkillable, friend, or way overdue.
One way or another, I am here, and there is much to discuss about all our futures.
What kind of future do you propose that to be?
I intend to gather forces and move to reclaim Nassau.
The conquest is always weakest when the conqueror allows himself to believe that it is done.
For Nassau, that point is now.
Now, England may hold the island, but it still needs supplies brought in.
It is still dependent upon trade.
We will make that impossible for him.
We will harass his ships.
We will plunder his supplies.
We will force him to bleed capital and support and the goodwill of the men surrounding him until he is weak enough to challenge directly.
Until we can bring the fleet to bear and retake the bay.
You know, when I called Nassau home, most of the men on this beach weren't even men.
I sailed with Ben Hornigold.
I sailed with Sam Bellamy.
I sailed with Henry Avery.
Feuded with them, stole from them, questioned their motives, but we all knew what we were.
Then a man arrives who would explain to us that what we've been doing was wrong all those years, what Nassau ought to be, what he could make it if we would all just follow his lead.
And here you are again to do the same.
You let it go well before its time.
It was past its time.
That you cannot see this only makes it clearer to me that you never even knew it in the first place.
This fleet is all that remains of it, and as long as it's mine, Nassau shall remain in its past.
It isn't yours.
It never was.
Those ships, their commanders and crews, they were pledged to my command, not yours.
Oaths were taken, and I have come to see them honored.
Do you honestly believe that I would just step aside and let you make that claim?
I honestly don't give a shit what you would or would not do.
The decision isn't yours.
It's his.
I've come to resume our compact, the one we swore upon our lives to uphold.
If you stand up and acknowledge it, this fleet will follow us.
I'm certain of it.
- You weren't there.
- No, I wasn't.
But had I been there, there would be no question about any of this.
Had I been there, we would have mounted the defense that we had agreed to mount.
Had you been there, you would have seen their faces, the ones who laid their arms down and turned their backs on us.
The ones who took our money for months and were happy to try and deliver my head to our enemies for a little more of it.
Nassau is dead.
It doesn't deserve anything else from me or the men on this beach.
We are finally free from it, and I see no reason to change that.
If you wish to leave this place, I'll allow it, although somehow I don't think you have any intention of leaving.
No, I don't.
And I think you know that I would never allow you to call a vote to settle the matter of who this fleet follows and risk you depleting my force by luring away some misguided minority.
No, I don't imagine you would.
So we have one fleet and two men claiming it.
There is only one way I know of to resolve that.
Pistols, then swords.
Captain Rackham.
It's a pleasure to finally meet you.
Give us the room, please.
Drink?
Thank you.
I apologize for the strangeness of this meeting.
I know you and I don't know each other.
I know you... some.
I read your book.
Did you?
Well, most of it.
I confess, I may not quite have soldiered through to the end.
But, you know, I got the gist of it.
If you don't mind my asking, what did you take to be its gist?
Wealthy son of a wealthy man takes to the sea to prove something to the parents, presumably.
Seeks adventure, finds the limits of his own capacity.
Loses everything in the process and then stumbles upon a hell of a story in the process.
Please understand, I'm quite particular about my library, but people seem to have liked it fine, and it seems to have done wonders for you.
So congratulations on all that.
Thank you.
All of that notwithstanding... you and I share an experience in this place.
And as such, I'm hopeful that you'll understand why it is I brought you here today and what it is I'm about to ask of you.
What's that?
I know you removed a significant amount of gold from the fort.
I know it is in your possession, and I need you to give it up... or we're all dead.
You can't win.
I hear you spent weeks becalmed, deprived of food and water.
At your best, it would have been a dogfight, but diminished...
I'm not that diminished.
He's been off the account for years.
He'll be more vulnerable than he remembers himself being.
He's not that vulnerable.
And for what?
You subject yourself to certain death for an island full of weaklings and ingrates?
Those men will go where they are led.
Rogers captured their minds before you could, but let's not pretend that they can't be won again.
And let's not pretend that either of us believes for a moment that I'm doing this for their sakes.
I gave you my word.
Shook your hand.
Pledged to defend the island with you.
But my pledge to him began a long time before I ever knew your name.
- What I owe him...
- I don't care.
I don't care that you shook my hand.
I don't care what you feel you owe him.
This is too important to be clouded by any of that.
They took my home.
I can't walk away from that.
Can you?
Forget me, forget Teach, forget loyalty, compacts, honor, debts, all of it.
The only question that matters is this.
Who are you?
Spain knows about the exchanges?
They do, and they are displeased.
How do you know they know?
So what does that look like?
Return it all or it's the Rosario raid all over again?
Something like that.
I understand why you did it.
I know what it feels like to lose everything and feel powerless to do anything about it.
The temptation to keep something to show for it all,
I understand it.
But it does not change the reality we face.
That you face.
For I assure you, if Spain invades over this, yours will be the first face they see.
I heard Henry Avery's name when I was a boy, heard the way people spoke it... grown men in awe of it.
I came to this place so determined to do the same.
That's not going to happen the way I thought it was, is it?
It never does.
My advice?
You want some say in how they speak of you?
Write a book.
Right now, what do you want to do?
Do you have a pen?
He's agreed to cooperate.
One man goes into the interior to deliver this, instructions written in his hand to his partner to return to Nassau and surrender the cache.
He said she may be wary, asked there be only one messenger to deliver the letter.
Give this to Lieutenant Hersey.
Have him prepare to depart for the interior.
I'll pass him details momentarily.
He should be made aware Anne will not be taken lightly.
Well, neither will Lieutenant Hersey.
I understand Jack was arrested today.
I would like to know why.
What happens if he loses?
If he loses, he dies.
I meant what happens to us?
I don't know.
Probably given a chance to join the fleet, fold in, and go back on the account.
When your men entreated me to join your crew, they said your captain was a man worth following.
A strong man, a wise man, they said.
But right now I can't tell which side of this contest you'd prefer to see prevail.
Can you help me make sense of that?
A few days ago I could make sense of all of it.
He was going to die and we were going to be free, from the account, from him...
With all the shit he's done, the things he's gotten away with, that would have been fair.
That would have been right.
I think part of the reason
I've been able to stand by his side is that I wanted to make sure I've got a good view of the moment the world finally catches up to him... and this story starts to make sense again.
This is a matter of honor to be settled once and for good in the here and now.
The parties have agreed to combat and have accepted common practice.
The parties have further agreed there will be no quarter asked nor given.
Cock your pistols!
From this moment, there's to be no movement until a count of three.
One... two... three!
Take him.
And get the fuck off my beach.
If you won't take the opium, at least take this to bite down on.
Just do it.
The burden I wasn't prepared for... it isn't the men.
It's him.
Flint?
What he wants, what he needs, what he fears... the depths of it... they are profound and dark.
I serve the crew best by tempering him, steering him where he's needed.
I've descended into those depths and connected with him so that I might be able to do so.
But I am acutely aware that I'm not the first to have been there... to have been a partner to him in this way.
And that the ones that have seen those depths before... they never surfaced again.
Maybe their mistake was in trying to do it alone.
Maybe to go to such a place, one needs another to hold the tether and to find a way out.
Maybe.
I know this cannot have been easy for you.
I know this is so far from how you thought things would end.
But I wanted you to know that the end of this may not quite be what you think it is.
How's that?
When Anne receives your letter and returns here with what remains of the cache,
Nassau will be secured, and everyone will know that it is because of Jack Rackham that it occurred.
I'll have spared Nassau... and you think the story of it will be told long after I am gone?
I know it will.
I will make sure of it.
Sounds a lifeless story to me, and one that requires commitments before the fact to ensure its retelling.
When the current story unfolds, I assure you, it's going to get around all on its own.
What does that mean?
I walked into this place today stunned at how quickly that man downstairs had completed his conquest, how thoroughly he had seemed to win just about everyone I know over to his side.
The truth of the matter is there's been no conquest.
It's only the appearance of one.
For conquest is an either/or proposition.
Either you have it or you do not.
It would appear that without that cache, he most certainly does not.
Jack, what did you do?
I sent word to Anne to take the cache and disappear.
No.
The governor saw your letter to her.
You don't think I can convey a thought to Anne comprehensible only to her?
A thought as simple as "run"?
A letter that said everything the governor wished it to say in exactly the way he'd want to say it would not sound like anything I'd ever say.
A thought here or two between the lines...
I assure you, she understood.
So I have begun the duel between myself and our Lord Governor.
The rules are simple.
I will deny him the cache.
No matter what sort of inducements he offers or pain he inflicts,
I will deny him the cache, and so I will deny him the victory.
And in doing so, I will ensure that whatever Nassau is come Christmas,
English will be not it.
Do not do this.
It's done.
So, one of two outcomes will result.
Rogers will understand his defeat to be ultimately inevitable and leave this place, in which case I'll have it back.
Or he'll stubbornly refuse and eventually Spain will raze this place to the ground.
The English flag will burn, and a second pirate republic will be born from the ashes of the first.
Only this time, every man who calls it home will know it came about because of me.
I worry... that we have made a terrible mistake.
I see what you see in them...
Silver and Flint.
But their relationship is so volatile and we have put our lives in their hands.
Those men rose to their stations because they are peerless when it comes to shaping the world to their will, in creating a narrative and wielding it to compel men's hearts and minds.
But the most compelling story requires a villain at its center.
And if either Captain Flint or Mr. Silver sees the other as a villain... or worse... us as that... then all is lost.
They are of great value to us, but they must be managed by us to avoid that outcome.
How?
I wish... you and I had not been so separate all those years.
I wish I could have found a way to be a better father to you.
But over time, I was determined to leave you something behind, to give you the one thing that no one could ever take away... and that would make you strong enough to understand their world, interact with their world... wage war on their world.
But if their identity lies in their stories,
I wanted you to know them so that when we are ready to call them enemies, you would be ready for it.
The villain makes the story.
So to manage our current partners, we must ensure that we all agree at all times who our common villain is.
The fugitive's name is Anne Bonny.
She's going for a capture of £500.
... several miles away on the road out of town.
Earlier today, before we knew Rackham was still on the island, you seemed confident that we could locate him and his friend in time.
You said it was possible because they didn't know that we were looking for them.
Why do I get the feeling, now that they do know, now that they've made it their personal crusade to see this regime fail, that your estimate will be far less optimistic?
The militia will help.
It will keep the pressure on, and perhaps we'll get lucky.
But if we don't, then you may have to be prepared...
Oh, I'm prepared to do anything.
Anne Bonny must be found.
The cache must be found.
Right now, that is all that matters.
And that said, the goodwill that we have engendered among the people of Nassau is not without limits.
The longer this drags out, the riskier it becomes, because if I find that money only to lose the street...
You will not.
If you have me, then you have the street.
I am all the reassurance they need.
Yes, Jack and Anne were my partners, my friends.
More.
But now they have made themselves something else to me.
I have sacrificed too much to build something here.
I will not let them take it away.
All he ever did was offer me his friendship.
I cast him aside once, spent years regretting it.
And now here we are again.
Tell me I didn't do it for nothing.
Well, I won't lie to you.
It would have helped having the fleet.
We have assets, we have allies.
The question is what we make of them.
I may be able to help in that regard.
Something to add to our pool of assets.
Before Ocracoke, we came upon a prize... a Spanish prize ferrying a significant trove of intelligence.
Most of it was destroyed by the time we found it, but among the remains was one piece of information, something everyone else was quick to dismiss as it held no value to them in that moment.
Information about what?
Money... separated from the Urca gold within the fort and rendered into a new form... a cache of gems for which Spain is holding the new governor accountable.
A cache which, if used creatively, could be the key to defeating British forces in Nassau.
The only question is, can we find it before he does?
HUDSON:
About six months ago,
I was approached by the intelligence department of the Casa de Contratación.
They offered me a significant amount of money.
I said yes.
The department's spies had learned of an attempt to walk away with their money without them knowing of it.
If you do not return the entirety of the hidden cache, know that Nassau will likely burn for it.
With everything I've lost in recent days,
I can't afford to lose the name, too.
We walk into the tavern, we sign our names, and then not only are we square with the law our money is, too.
The wound should be far further along towards quietening itself.
If the decay progresses,
I'll have to remove more of your leg.
What does a colonial power do when they see a sitting governor deposed by an alliance of pirates and slaves bring down Nassau?
Maybe bring it all down.
What happens now?
Now we go find Charles Vane.

I understood a war meant to antagonize England to frighten them, to prevent them from moving against Nassau.
But that isn't what we're talking about anymore, is it?
Now you're talking about a war meant to be won.

HUDSON:
At first I was tempted, but in the end it felt wrong to betray the governor that way.
And it felt dangerous... so I declined.
Then how did this happen?
How does an honest chambermaid end up in the employ of the Spanish empire?
A few days after I declined their offer...
I came home late from the governor's service.
It wasn't unusual for me to return home to find my children long since fast asleep.
That night, my children were not alone.
The man who had approached me
Grandal... was there... waiting.
In his left hand, a knife.
In his right, a purse.
He said my children would receive something from him that night.
He asked me to choose which.
These are the people whom I am beholden to.
This is what they are capable of doing.
I cannot imagine what they will do if the cache is not returned whole.
Ship's manifest, sir.
The entirety of the gold from the fort is now stowed and ready for transport to Havana.
We should be under way within the hour.
Put it in my office, please.
I just left Miss Hudson.
I had the instinct once or twice, the way she'd been watching me of late.
I dismissed it, just assumed it related to some concern over my relationship with you and its becoming inappropriate.
What did she say?
Did she report that we're earnestly attempting to find and return the missing money?
It's not about the money for them, not anymore.
When the gold from the Urca was stolen, it was bad enough.
Now they hear the gold is being converted into something more easily hidden from them, more easily smuggled away.
That isn't theft.
It's an insult.
And insults to empires require answers.
So it's personal, then?
A binary question of my trustworthiness.
Either I return the full cache and prove it or I fail, and in trying to excuse the shortfall, only aggravate their existing suspicion that I am part of the pirate problem, not its solution.
And the dread fleet in Havana sets sail the very next day to raze all of Nassau to the ground.
Then we'll fight them, defend the island.
The odds would be dire, but we are not without resources.
No, not "we."
I mean, someone might fight them, but it won't be you and I.
If the result of my endeavor here is a Spanish attack against British forces, an act that threatens to drag the empire into a war,
I would be recalled to London and likely debtors' prison and your capital sentence would be reinstated.
Now, I believe Nassau's best chance at survival is with me guiding it.
But if we cannot find Jack Rackham and Anne Bonny, if we can't find the cache in their possession, whatever happens to Nassau, you and I are likely finished.
[metal clanging]

Pardon me, gentlemen, if you don't mind me asking, where is this wagon headed?

To fix it.

You're supposed to be long gone by now.
Why'd you come back?
Where we're going, it seemed better to have one of these than not.
I thought as an added prize,
I'd at least be able to see it for myself, the new governor up to his ears in the very same bullshit in which I've been drowning for the past few months.
And what do I find?
The streets are swept, industry is in fashion, you're dressed like a Turkish whore, and all because a man arrived, stood on the beach, and said please.
- You're angry.
- I'm confounded.
He offers them less in wages than I offered, demands more from them in labor, restricts more from them in license, and yet despite all of that, he's won them.
How can that be?
I know it may be hard to believe given my appearance at the moment, but the experience of it?
It ain't half bad, Jack.
Next.
Next man, please.
Your legal name?
John Rackham.
What?
The Lord Governor would like a word with you.
- [people shouting in native language] - [breathing heavily]
Watch him, please.
I'll go fetch Fremah to tend to him.
I said no.
- I know you did.
- I don't want help.
It'll pass.
I'll just find a place to weather it for the night.
I understand that you do not want anyone to see you this way.
What I don't understand is why you choose to suffer in the first place.
You must have access to better medicines than that.
We've got access to better medicines than that.
This has nothing to do with medicine.
It has something to do with medicine...
I cannot look weak.
I cannot feel weak.
I cannot be weak.
Not in front of my men.
Not in front of your men.
Not at all.
For some time now, I have been holding my entire world together with both hands, keeping my men in line, seeing to their needs, and the only way that endures is if I look the part.
And I cannot look the part while being poked and prodded or while drooling through an opium haze saying who the fuck knows what.
So I will endure this the way I have been enduring it.
No one prepared you for this, did they?
[breathing heavily]
For as long as I can remember,
I have been prepared for the day
I would take my mother's place.
To know that from that day forth,
I would forever be the one who tends as opposed to the one who is tended to.
You're frustrated.
You're angry.
You're tired.
Perhaps no one else knows why.
I believe that not even you know why.
But I know why.
The crown is always a burden... but it cannot be borne if you cannot stand.
[waves crashing]
Nearly dismasted in a storm... a storm you chased after.
Nearly starved to death in the doldrums.
Nearly executed by them.
Either you are unkillable, friend, or way overdue.
One way or another, I am here, and there is much to discuss about all our futures.
What kind of future do you propose that to be?
I intend to gather forces and move to reclaim Nassau.
The conquest is always weakest when the conqueror allows himself to believe that it is done.
For Nassau, that point is now.
Now, England may hold the island, but it still needs supplies brought in.
It is still dependent upon trade.
We will make that impossible for him.
We will harass his ships.
We will plunder his supplies.
We will force him to bleed capital and support and the goodwill of the men surrounding him until he is weak enough to challenge directly.
Until we can bring the fleet to bear and retake the bay.
You know, when I called Nassau home, most of the men on this beach weren't even men.
I sailed with Ben Hornigold.
I sailed with Sam Bellamy.
I sailed with Henry Avery.
Feuded with them, stole from them, questioned their motives, but we all knew what we were.
Then a man arrives who would explain to us that what we've been doing was wrong all those years, what Nassau ought to be, what he could make it if we would all just follow his lead.
And here you are again to do the same.
You let it go well before its time.
It was past its time.
That you cannot see this only makes it clearer to me that you never even knew it in the first place.
This fleet is all that remains of it, and as long as it's mine, Nassau shall remain in its past.
It isn't yours.
It never was.
Those ships, their commanders and crews, they were pledged to my command, not yours.
Oaths were taken, and I have come to see them honored.
Do you honestly believe that I would just step aside and let you make that claim?
I honestly don't give a shit what you would or would not do.
The decision isn't yours.
It's his.
I've come to resume our compact, the one we swore upon our lives to uphold.
If you stand up and acknowledge it, this fleet will follow us.
I'm certain of it.
- You weren't there.
- No, I wasn't.
But had I been there, there would be no question about any of this.
Had I been there, we would have mounted the defense that we had agreed to mount.
Had you been there, you would have seen their faces, the ones who laid their arms down and turned their backs on us.
The ones who took our money for months and were happy to try and deliver my head to our enemies for a little more of it.
Nassau is dead.
It doesn't deserve anything else from me or the men on this beach.
We are finally free from it, and I see no reason to change that.
If you wish to leave this place, I'll allow it, although somehow I don't think you have any intention of leaving.
No, I don't.
And I think you know that I would never allow you to call a vote to settle the matter of who this fleet follows and risk you depleting my force by luring away some misguided minority.
No, I don't imagine you would.
So we have one fleet and two men claiming it.
There is only one way I know of to resolve that.
Pistols, then swords.
Captain Rackham.
It's a pleasure to finally meet you.
Give us the room, please.
Drink?
Thank you.
I apologize for the strangeness of this meeting.
I know you and I don't know each other.
[door closes]
I know you... some.
I read your book.
Did you?
Well, most of it.
I confess, I may not quite have soldiered through to the end.
But, you know, I got the gist of it.
If you don't mind my asking, what did you take to be its gist?
Wealthy son of a wealthy man takes to the sea to prove something to the parents, presumably.
Seeks adventure, finds the limits of his own capacity.
Loses everything in the process and then stumbles upon a hell of a story in the process.
Please understand, I'm quite particular about my library, but people seem to have liked it fine, and it seems to have done wonders for you.
So congratulations on all that.
Thank you.
All of that notwithstanding... you and I share an experience in this place.
And as such, I'm hopeful that you'll understand why it is I brought you here today and what it is I'm about to ask of you.
What's that?
I know you removed a significant amount of gold from the fort.
I know it is in your possession, and I need you to give it up... or we're all dead.
- [men muttering] - [seagulls screeching]
You can't win.
[grunts]
I hear you spent weeks becalmed, deprived of food and water.
At your best, it would have been a dogfight, but diminished...
I'm not that diminished.
He's been off the account for years.
He'll be more vulnerable than he remembers himself being.
He's not that vulnerable.
And for what?
You subject yourself to certain death for an island full of weaklings and ingrates?
Those men will go where they are led.
Rogers captured their minds before you could, but let's not pretend that they can't be won again.
And let's not pretend that either of us believes for a moment that I'm doing this for their sakes.
I gave you my word.
Shook your hand.
Pledged to defend the island with you.
But my pledge to him began a long time before I ever knew your name.
- What I owe him...
- I don't care.
I don't care that you shook my hand.
I don't care what you feel you owe him.
This is too important to be clouded by any of that.
They took my home.
I can't walk away from that.
Can you?
Forget me, forget Teach, forget loyalty, compacts, honor, debts, all of it.
The only question that matters is this.
Who are you?
Spain knows about the exchanges?
They do, and they are displeased.
How do you know they know?
So what does that look like?
Return it all or it's the Rosario raid all over again?
- [pouring]
- Something like that.
I understand why you did it.
I know what it feels like to lose everything and feel powerless to do anything about it.
The temptation to keep something to show for it all,
I understand it.
But it does not change the reality we face.
That you face.
For I assure you, if Spain invades over this, yours will be the first face they see.
I heard Henry Avery's name when I was a boy, heard the way people spoke it... grown men in awe of it.
I came to this place so determined to do the same.
That's not going to happen the way I thought it was, is it?
It never does.
My advice?
You want some say in how they speak of you?
Write a book.
[laughs]
Right now, what do you want to do?
Do you have a pen?
ROGERS:
He's agreed to cooperate.
One man goes into the interior to deliver this, instructions written in his hand to his partner to return to Nassau and surrender the cache.
He said she may be wary, asked there be only one messenger to deliver the letter.
Give this to Lieutenant Hersey.
Have him prepare to depart for the interior.
I'll pass him details momentarily.
He should be made aware Anne will not be taken lightly.
Well, neither will Lieutenant Hersey.
I understand Jack was arrested today.
I would like to know why.
[crowd chattering]

[man mutters]
What happens if he loses?
If he loses, he dies.
I meant what happens to us?
I don't know.
Probably given a chance to join the fleet, fold in, and go back on the account.
When your men entreated me to join your crew, they said your captain was a man worth following.
A strong man, a wise man, they said.
But right now I can't tell which side of this contest you'd prefer to see prevail.
Can you help me make sense of that?
[men muttering]
A few days ago I could make sense of all of it.
He was going to die and we were going to be free, from the account, from him... [sighs]
With all the shit he's done, the things he's gotten away with, that would have been fair.
That would have been right.
I think part of the reason
I've been able to stand by his side is that I wanted to make sure I've got a good view of the moment the world finally catches up to him... and this story starts to make sense again.
This is a matter of honor to be settled once and for good in the here and now.
The parties have agreed to combat and have accepted common practice.
The parties have further agreed there will be no quarter asked nor given.

[door opens]
I know this cannot have been easy for you.
I know this is so far from how you thought things would end.
But I wanted you to know that the end of this may not quite be what you think it is.
How's that?
When Anne receives your letter and returns here with what remains of the cache,
Nassau will be secured, and everyone will know that it is because of Jack Rackham that it occurred.
I'll have spared Nassau... and you think the story of it will be told long after I am gone?
I know it will.
I will make sure of it.
Sounds a lifeless story to me, and one that requires commitments before the fact to ensure its retelling.
When the current story unfolds, I assure you, it's going to get around all on its own.
What does that mean?
I walked into this place today stunned at how quickly that man downstairs had completed his conquest, how thoroughly he had seemed to win just about everyone I know over to his side.
The truth of the matter is there's been no conquest.
It's only the appearance of one.
For conquest is an either/or proposition.
Either you have it or you do not.
It would appear that without that cache, he most certainly does not.
Jack, what did you do?
I sent word to Anne to take the cache and disappear.
No.
The governor saw your letter to her.
You don't think I can convey a thought to Anne comprehensible only to her?
A thought as simple as "run"?
A letter that said everything the governor wished it to say in exactly the way he'd want to say it would not sound like anything I'd ever say.
A thought here or two between the lines...
I assure you, she understood.
So I have begun the duel between myself and our Lord Governor.
The rules are simple.
I will deny him the cache.
No matter what sort of inducements he offers or pain he inflicts,
I will deny him the cache, and so I will deny him the victory.
And in doing so, I will ensure that whatever Nassau is come Christmas,
English will be not it.
[silent]
Do not do this.
It's done.
RACKHAM:
So, one of two outcomes will result.
Rogers will understand his defeat to be ultimately inevitable and leave this place, in which case I'll have it back.
Or he'll stubbornly refuse and eventually Spain will raze this place to the ground.
The English flag will burn, and a second pirate republic will be born from the ashes of the first.
Only this time, every man who calls it home will know it came about because of me.
- [crickets chirping] - [people chattering in native language]
I worry... that we have made a terrible mistake.
I see what you see in them...
Silver and Flint.
But their relationship is so volatile and we have put our lives in their hands.
Those men rose to their stations because they are peerless when it comes to shaping the world to their will, in creating a narrative and wielding it to compel men's hearts and minds.
But the most compelling story requires a villain at its center.
And if either Captain Flint or Mr. Silver sees the other as a villain... or worse... us as that... then all is lost.
They are of great value to us, but they must be managed by us to avoid that outcome.
How?
I wish... you and I had not been so separate all those years.
I wish I could have found a way to be a better father to you.
But over time, I was determined to leave you something behind, to give you the one thing that no one could ever take away... and that would make you strong enough to understand their world, interact with their world... wage war on their world.
But if their identity lies in their stories,
I wanted you to know them so that when we are ready to call them enemies, you would be ready for it.
The villain makes the story.
So to manage our current partners, we must ensure that we all agree at all times who our common villain is.
MAN:
The fugitive's name is Anne Bonny.
She's going for a capture of £500.
[chattering]
MAN: ... several miles away on the road out of town.
[chatter continues] [horse neighs, hoofbeats depart]
Earlier today, before we knew Rackham was still on the island, you seemed confident that we could locate him and his friend in time.
You said it was possible because they didn't know that we were looking for them.
Why do I get the feeling, now that they do know, now that they've made it their personal crusade to see this regime fail, that your estimate will be far less optimistic?
The militia will help.
It will keep the pressure on, and perhaps we'll get lucky.
But if we don't, then you may have to be prepared...
Oh, I'm prepared to do anything.
Anne Bonny must be found.
The cache must be found.
Right now, that is all that matters.
And that said, the goodwill that we have engendered among the people of Nassau is not without limits.
The longer this drags out, the riskier it becomes, because if I find that money only to lose the street...
You will not.
If you have me, then you have the street.
I am all the reassurance they need.
Yes, Jack and Anne were my partners, my friends.
More.
But now they have made themselves something else to me.
I have sacrificed too much to build something here.
I will not let them take it away.
[bell ringing]
All he ever did was offer me his friendship.
I cast him aside once, spent years regretting it.
And now here we are again.
Tell me I didn't do it for nothing.
Well, I won't lie to you.
It would have helped having the fleet.
We have assets, we have allies.
The question is what we make of them.
I may be able to help in that regard.
Something to add to our pool of assets.
Before Ocracoke, we came upon a prize... a Spanish prize ferrying a significant trove of intelligence.
Most of it was destroyed by the time we found it, but among the remains was one piece of information, something everyone else was quick to dismiss as it held no value to them in that moment.
Information about what?
Money... separated from the Urca gold within the fort and rendered into a new form... a cache of gems for which Spain is holding the new governor accountable.
A cache which, if used creatively, could be the key to defeating British forces in Nassau.
The only question is, can we find it before he does?
♪
Aboutsixmonthsago ,
I was approached by the intelligence department of the Casa de Contratación.
They offered me a significant amount of money.
I said yes.
The department's spies had learned of an attempt to walk away with their money without them knowing of it.
If you do not return the entirety of the hidden cache, know that Nassau will likely burn for it.
With everything I've lost in recent days,
I can't afford to lose the name, too.
We walk into the tavern, we sign our names, and then not only are we square with the law, our money is, too.
The wound should be far further along towards quietening itself.
If the decay progresses,
I'll have to remove more of your leg.
What does a colonial power do when they see a sitting governor deposed by an alliance of pirates and slaves bring down Nassau?
Maybe bring it all down.
What happens now?
Now we go find Charles Vane.
Where is he?
When you said that you'd be staying behind to solidify our new compact,
I assumed that meant something.
For you to be seen as uninterested in what is happening for my father now, that is not going to help convince anyone here that you are serious about desiring their friendship.
It'll pass.
It's just a fever from the wound.
I'm fine.
Christ!
I'm all right!
Swing it down on deck!
Fucking idiot!
Listen, if you can't tie a rope, you shouldn't be on this ship!
Get astern.
Calm down!
Hey!
What's going on here?
His lashing came undone.
I fucking showed it to him 10 minutes ago.
Someone could have been killed.
Then you showed him incorrectly.
It's a fucking lashing.
I know how to tie it.
If he tied it wrong, then you instructed him wrong.
You listen to me.
We persuaded them that they need us.
We most certainly need them.
Do you understand what I'm saying?
Don't imagine that will be the last of those.
Neither do I.
So how exactly do you see this working?
They have their orders.
As long as we hold our end of the bargain, they'll hold.
Yeah, that wasn't what I meant.
I understood a war meant to antagonize England-- to frighten them, to prevent them from moving against Nassau.
But that isn't what we're talking about anymore, is it?
Now you're talking about a war meant to be won.
You convinced them.
Convinced Scott, his wife, their people, our people, even Silver.
But not you.
Everyone's wrong but you.
Maybe.
Captain!
Masts!
Captain.
Ocracoke Island.
Teach is there.
A few hours' time, assuming he's there,
I'm going to begin a discussion in which I'm going to ask him for something that he can't possibly give.
And the success or failure of this war will depend upon the outcome.
In a few hours' time, there's a good chance you're going to look awfully smart.
What are you doing?
Bring him down!
You look good.
As handsome as ever.
You always were a gifted liar.
When you were still pirating,
I was the woman who was Blackbeard's woman.
Put my services in great demand-- all men wanting what notorious men already had.
And then you leave and my business fades.
It's always the little people who get hurt the worst when the market turns.
So when are you going to tell me?
Tell you what?
What he's doing here.
Charles?
I remember when he had forced you from Nassau.
I remember how angry you were, how disappointed.
And I remember you telling me that you'd never make the same mistake again, that you had learned the hard way that only God made sons.
Things are different now.
Different how?
Doesn't need to last long.
A little Spanish shrapnel.
It went in here when I was not much older than him.
Once in a while it migrates, ticks closer to reaching its terminus and striking its chime.
Grim little timepiece whose ticking has grown louder to my ears of late.
Charles doesn't know, does he?
Captain!
Jesus.
Welcome to Ocracoke.
At first I was tempted, but in the end it felt wrong to betray the governor that way.
And it felt dangerous... so I declined.
Then how did this happen?
How does an honest chambermaid end up in the employ of the Spanish empire?
A few days after I declined their offer...
I came home late from the governor's service.
It wasn't unusual for me to return home to find my children long since fast asleep.
That night, my children were not alone.
The man who had approached me-
Grandal-- was there... waiting.
In his left hand, a knife.
In his right, a purse.
He said my children would receive something from him that night.
He asked me to choose which.
These are the people whom I am beholden to.
This is what they are capable of doing.
I cannot imagine what they will do if the cache is not returned whole.
Ship's manifest, sir.
The entirety of the gold from the fort is now stowed and ready for transport to Havana.
We should be under way within the hour.
Put it in my office, please.
I just left Miss Hudson.
I had the instinct once or twice, the way she'd been watching me of late.
I dismissed it, just assumed it related to some concern over my relationship with you and its becoming inappropriate.
What did she say?
Did she report that we're earnestly attempting to find and return the missing money?
It's not about the money for them, not anymore.
When the gold from the Urca was stolen, it was bad enough.
Now they hear the gold is being converted into something more easily hidden from them, more easily smuggled away.
That isn't theft.
It's an insult.
And insults to empires require answers.
So it's personal, then?
A binary question of my trustworthiness.
Either I return the full cache and prove it or I fail, and in trying to excuse the shortfall, only aggravate their existing suspicion that I am part of the pirate problem, not its solution.
And the dread fleet in Havana sets sail the very next day to raze all of Nassau to the ground.
Then we'll fight them, defend the island.
The odds would be dire, but we are not without resources.
No, not "we."
I mean, someone might fight them, but it won't be you and I.
If the result of my endeavor here is a Spanish attack against British forces, an act that threatens to drag the empire into a war,
I would be recalled to London and likely debtors' prison and your capital sentence would be reinstated.
Now, I believe Nassau's best chance at survival is with me guiding it.
But if we cannot find Jack Rackham and Anne Bonny, if we can't find the cache in their possession, whatever happens to Nassau, you and I are likely finished.
Pardon me, gentlemen, if you don't mind me asking, where is this wagon headed?
To the fort.
To do what, exactly?
To fix it.
I see.
Just you two on the job, is it?
A whole gang of us up there.
Governor wants it shipshape by the end of the month.
Suppose that fort's not going to rebuild itself.
No, I suppose it won't.
Hold still.
There.
Well?
What do you think?
You mean aside from the tit curtains?
It's called a cravat.
You want to fit in with them, right?
This is what they wear.
"They" who?
Respectable men.
All right, yeah.
Place of birth?
Bristol.
Occupation?
Ship's carpenter.
Ship served?
I used to serve the Buccaneer.
Sign here.
Move on.
Next?
What the fuck are you doing here?
It's a cravat.
It's what respectable men wear.
It's-- never mind what it is.
You're supposed to be long gone by now.
Why'd you come back?
Where we're going, it seemed better to have one of these than not.
I thought as an added prize,
I'd at least be able to see it for myself, the new governor up to his ears in the very same bullshit in which I've been drowning for the past few months.
And what do I find?
The streets are swept, industry is in fashion, you're dressed like a Turkish whore, and all because a man arrived, stood on the beach, and said please.
You're angry.
I'm confounded.
He offers them less in wages than I offered, demands more from them in labor, restricts more from them in license, and yet despite all of that, he's won them.
How can that be?
I know it may be hard to believe given my appearance at the moment, but the experience of it?
It ain't half bad, Jack.
Next.
Next man, please.
Your legal name?
John Rackham.
What?
The Lord Governor would like a word with you.
Watch him, please.
I'll go fetch Fremah to tend to him.
I said no.
I know you did.
I don't want help.
It'll pass.
I'll just find a place to weather it for the night.
I understand that you do not want anyone to see you this way.
What I don't understand is why you choose to suffer in the first place.
You must have access to better medicines than that.
We've got access to better medicines than that.
This has nothing to do with medicine.
It has something to do with medicine--
I cannot look weak.
I cannot feel weak.
I cannot be weak.
Not in front of my men.
Not in front of your men.
Not at all.
For some time now, I have been holding my entire world together with both hands, keeping my men in line, seeing to their needs, and the only way that endures is if I look the part.
And I cannot look the part while being poked and prodded or while drooling through an opium haze saying who the fuck knows what.
So I will endure this the way I have been enduring it.
No one prepared you for this, did they?
For as long as I can remember,
I have been prepared for the day
I would take my mother's place.
To know that from that day forth,
I would forever be the one who tends as opposed to the one who is tended to.
You're frustrated.
You're angry.
You're tired.
Perhaps no one else knows why.
I believe that not even you know why.
But I know why.
The crown is always a burden... but it cannot be borne if you cannot stand.
Nearly dismasted in a storm-- a storm you chased after.
Nearly starved to death in the doldrums.
Nearly executed by them.
Either you are unkillable, friend, or way overdue.
One way or another, I am here, and there is much to discuss about all our futures.
What kind of future do you propose that to be?
I intend to gather forces and move to reclaim Nassau.
The conquest is always weakest when the conqueror allows himself to believe that it is done.
For Nassau, that point is now.
Now, England may hold the island, but it still needs supplies brought in.
It is still dependent upon trade.
We will make that impossible for him.
We will harass his ships.
We will plunder his supplies.
We will force him to bleed capital and support and the goodwill of the men surrounding him until he is weak enough to challenge directly.
Until we can bring the fleet to bear and retake the bay.
You know, when I called Nassau home, most of the men on this beach weren't even men.
I sailed with Ben Hornigold.
I sailed with Sam Bellamy.
I sailed with Henry Avery.
Feuded with them, stole from them, questioned their motives, but we all knew what we were.
Then a man arrives who would explain to us that what we've been doing was wrong all those years, what Nassau ought to be, what he could make it if we would all just follow his lead.
And here you are again to do the same.
You let it go well before its time.
It was past its time.
That you cannot see this only makes it clearer to me that you never even knew it in the first place.
This fleet is all that remains of it, and as long as it's mine, Nassau shall remain in its past.
It isn't yours.
It never was.
Those ships, their commanders and crews, they were pledged to my command, not yours.
Oaths were taken, and I have come to see them honored.
Do you honestly believe that I would just step aside and let you make that claim?
I honestly don't give a shit what you would or would not do.
The decision isn't yours.
It's his.
I've come to resume our compact, the one we swore upon our lives to uphold.
If you stand up and acknowledge it, this fleet will follow us.
I'm certain of it.
You weren't there.
No, I wasn't.
But had I been there, there would be no question about any of this.
Had I been there, we would have mounted the defense that we had agreed to mount.
Had you been there, you would have seen their faces, the ones who laid their arms down and turned their backs on us.
The ones who took our money for months and were happy to try and deliver my head to our enemies for a little more of it.
Nassau is dead.
It doesn't deserve anything else from me or the men on this beach.
We are finally free from it, and I see no reason to change that.
If you wish to leave this place, I'll allow it, although somehow I don't think you have any intention of leaving.
No, I don't.
And I think you know that I would never allow you to call a vote to settle the matter of who this fleet follows and risk you depleting my force by luring away some misguided minority.
No, I don't imagine you would.
So we have one fleet and two men claiming it.
There is only one way I know of to resolve that.
Pistols, then swords.
Captain Rackham.
It's a pleasure to finally meet you.
Give us the room, please.
Drink?
Thank you.
I apologize for the strangeness of this meeting.
I know you and I don't know each other.
I know you... some.
I read your book.
Did you?
Well, most of it.
I confess, I may not quite have soldiered through to the end.
But, you know, I got the gist of it.
If you don't mind my asking, what did you take to be its gist?
Wealthy son of a wealthy man takes to the sea to prove something to the parents, presumably.
Seeks adventure, finds the limits of his own capacity.
Loses everything in the process and then stumbles upon a hell of a story in the process.
Please understand, I'm quite particular about my library, but people seem to have liked it fine, and it seems to have done wonders for you.
So congratulations on all that.
Thank you.
All of that not withstanding... you and I share an experience in this place.
And as such, I'm hopeful that you'll understand why it is I brought you here today and what it is I'm about to ask of you.
What's that?
I know you removed a significant amount of gold from the fort.
I know it is in your possession, and I need you to give it up... or we're all dead.
You can't win.
I hear you spent weeks becalmed, deprived of food and water.
At your best, it would have been a dogfight, but diminished...
I'm not that diminished.
He's been off the account for years.
He'll be more vulnerable than he remembers himself being.
He's not that vulnerable.
And for what?
You subject yourself to certain death for an island full of weaklings and ingrates?
Those men will go where they are led.
Rogers captured their minds before you could, but let's not pretend that they can't be won again.
And let's not pretend that either of us believes for a moment that I'm doing this for their sakes.
I gave you my word.
Shook your hand.
Pledged to defend the island with you.
But my pledge to him began a long time before I ever knew your name.
What I owe him-- I don't care.
I don't care that you shook my hand.
I don't care what you feel you owe him.
This is too important to be clouded by any of that.
They took my home.
I can't walk away from that.
Can you?
Forget me, forget Teach, forget loyalty, compacts, honor, debts, all of it.
The only question that matters is this.
Who are you?
Spain knows about the exchanges?
They do, and they are displeased.
How do you know they know?
So what does that look like?
Return it all or it's the Rosario raid all over again?
Something like that.
I understand why you did it.
I know what it feels like to lose everything and feel powerless to do anything about it.
The temptation to keep something to show for it all,
I understand it.
But it does not change the reality we face.
That you face.
For I assure you, if Spain invades over this, yours will be the first face they see.
I heard Henry Avery's name when I was a boy, heard the way people spoke it-- grown men in awe of it.
I came to this place so determined to do the same.
That's not going to happen the way I thought it was, is it?
It never does.
My advice?
You want some say in how they speak of you?
Write a book.
Right now, what do you want to do?
Do you have a pen?
He's agreed to cooperate.
One man goes into the interior to deliver this, instructions written in his hand to his partner to return to Nassau and surrender the cache.
He said she may be wary, asked there be only one messenger to deliver the letter.
Give this to Lieutenant Hersey.
Have him prepare to depart for the interior.
I'll pass him details momentarily.
He should be made aware Anne will not be taken lightly.
Well, neither will Lieutenant Hersey.
I understand Jack was arrested today.
I would like to know why.
What happens if he loses?
If he loses, he dies.
I meant what happens to us?
I don't know.
Probably given a chance to join the fleet, fold in, and go back on the account.
When your men entreated me to join your crew, they said your captain was a man worth following.
A strong man, a wise man, they said.
But right now I can't tell which side of this contest you'd prefer to see prevail.
Can you help me make sense of that?
A few days ago I could make sense of all of it.
He was going to die and we were going to be free, from the account, from him...
With all the shit he's done, the things he's gotten away with, that would have been fair.
That would have been right.
I think part of the reason
I've been able to stand by his side is that I wanted to make sure I've got a good view of the moment the world finally catches up to him... and this story starts to make sense again.
This is a matter of honor to be settled once and for good in the here and now.
The parties have agreed to combat and have accepted common practice.
The parties have further agreed there will be no quarter asked nor given.
Cock your pistols!
From this moment, there's to be no movement untila countof three.
One... two... three!
Take him.
And get the fuck off my beach.
If you won't take the opium, at least take this to bite down on.
Just do it.
The burden I wasn't prepared for it isn't the men.
It's him.
Flint?
What he wants, what he needs, what he fears... the depths of it... they are profound and dark.
I serve the crew best by tempering him, steering him where he's needed.
I've descended into those depths and connected with him so that I might be able to do so.
But I am acutely aware that I'm not the first to have been there... to have been a partner to him in this way.
And that the ones that have seen those depths before... they never surfaced again.
Maybe their mistake was in trying to do it alone.
Maybe to go to such a place, one needs another to hold the tether and to find a way out.
Maybe.
I know this cannot have been easy for you.
I know this is so far from how you thought things would end.
But I wanted you to know that the end of this may not quite be what you think it is.
How's that?
When Anne receives your letter and returns here with what remains of the cache,
Nassau will be secured, and everyone will know that it is because of Jack Rackham that it occurred.
I'll have spared Nassau... and you think the story of it will be told long after I am gone?
I know it will.
I will make sure of it.
Sounds a lifeless story to me, and one that requires commitments before the fact to ensure its retelling.
When the current story unfolds, I assure you, it's going to get around all on its own.
What does that mean?
I walked intothis place today stunned at how quickly that man downstairs had completed his conquest, how thoroughly he had seemed to win just about everyone I know over to his side.
The truth of the matter is there's been no conquest.
It's only the appearance of one.
For conquest is an either/or proposition.
Either you have it or you do not.
It would appear that without that cache, he most certainly does not.
Jack, what did you do?
I sent word to Anne to take the cache and disappear.
No.
The governor saw your letter to her.
You don't think I can convey a thought to Anne comprehensible only to her?
A thought as simple as "run"?
A letter that said everything the governor wished it to say in exactly the way he'd want to say it would not sound like anything I'd ever say.
A thought here or two between the lines--
I assure you, she understood.
So I have begun the duel between myself and our Lord Governor.
The rules are simple.
I will deny him the cache.
No matter what sort of inducements he offers or pain he inflicts,
I will deny him the cache, and so I will deny him the victory.
And in doing so, I will ensure that whatever Nassau is come Christmas,
English will be not it.
Do not do this.
It's done.
So, one of two outcomes will result.
Rogers will understand his defeat to be ultimately inevitable and leave this place, in which case I'll have it back.
Or he'll stubbornly refuse and eventually Spain will raze this place to the ground.
The English flag will burn, and a second pirate republic will be born from the ashes of the first.
Only this time, every man who calls it home will know it came about because of me.
I worry... that we have made a terrible mistake.
I see what you see in them--
Silver and Flint.
But their relationship is so volatile and we have put our lives in their hands.
Those men rose to their stations because they are peerless when it comes to shaping the world to their will, in creating a narrative and wielding it to compel men's hearts and minds.
But the most compelling story requires a villain at its center.
And if either Captain Flint or Mr. Silver sees the other as a villain-- or worse... us as that-- then all is lost.
They are of great value to us, but they must be managed by us to avoid that outcome.
How?
I wish... you and I had not been so separate all those years.
I wish I could have found a way to be a better father to you.
But over time, I was determined to leave you something behind, to give you the one thing that no one could ever take away... and that would make you strong enough to understand their world, interact with their world... wage war on their world.
But if their identity lies in their stories,
I wanted you to know them so that when we are ready to call them enemies, you would be ready for it.
The villain makes the story.
So to manage our current partners, we must ensure that we all agree at all times who our common villain is.
The fugitive's name is Anne Bonny.
She's going for a capture of £500.
...several miles away on the road out of town.
Earlier today, before we knew Rackham was still on the island, you seemed confident that we could locate him and his friend in time.
You said it was possible because they didn't know that we were looking for them.
Why do I get the feeling, now that they do know, now that they've made it their personal crusade to see this regime fail, that your estimate will be far less optimistic?
The militia will help.
It will keep the pressure on, and perhaps we'll get lucky.
Butifwe don't,thenyoumayhave tobeprepared--
Oh, I'm prepared to do anything.
Anne Bonny must be found.
The cache must be found.
Right now, that is all that matters.
And that said, the goodwill that we have engendered among the people of Nassau is not without limits.
The longer this drags out, the riskier it becomes, because if I find that money only to lose the street--
You will not.
If you have me, then you have the street.
I am all the reassurance they need.
Yes, Jack and Anne were my partners, my friends.
More.
But now they have made themselves something else to me.
I have sacrificed too much to build something here.
I will not let them take it away.
All he ever did was offer me his friendship.
I cast him aside once, spent years regretting it.
And now here we are again.
Tell me I didn't do it for nothing.
Well, I won't lie to you.
It would have helped having the fleet.
We have assets, we have allies.
The question is what we make of them.
I may be able to help in that regard.
Something to add to our pool of assets.
Before Ocracoke, we came upon a prize-- a Spanish prize ferrying a significant trove of intelligence.
Most of it was destroyed by the time we found it, but among the remains was one piece of information, something everyone else was quick to dismiss as it held no value to them in that moment.

Money... separated from the Urca gold within the fort and rendered into a new form-- a cache of gems for which Spain is holding the new governor accountable.
A cache which, if used creatively, could be the key to defeating British forces in Nassau.
The only question is, can we find it before he does?
Aboutsixmonthsago ,

The wound should be far further along towards quietening itself.
If the decay progresses,
I'll have to remove more of your leg.
What does a colonial power do when they see a sitting governor deposed by an alliance of pirates and slaves bring down Nassau?
Maybe bring it all down.
What happens now?
Now we go find Charles Vane.
Where is he?
When you said that you'd be staying behind to solidify our new compact,
I assumed that meant something.
For you to be seen as uninterested in what is happening for my father now, that is not going to help convince anyone here that you are serious about desiring their friendship.

It's just a fever from the wound.
I'm fine.
Christ!
I'm all right!
Swing it down on deck!
Fucking idiot!
Listen, if you can't tie a rope, you shouldn't be on this ship!
Get astern.
Calm down!
Hey!
What's going on here?
His lashing came undone.
I fucking showed it to him 10 minutes ago.
Someone could have been killed.
Then you showed him incorrectly.
It's a fucking lashing.
I know how to tie it.
If he tied it wrong, then you instructed him wrong.
You listen to me.
We persuaded them that they need us.
We most certainly need them.
Do you understand what I'm saying?
Don't imagine that will be the last of those.
Neither do I.
So how exactly do you see this working?
They have their orders.
As long as we hold our end of the bargain, they'll hold.
Yeah, that wasn't what I meant.
I understood a war meant to antagonize England-- to frighten them, to prevent them from moving against Nassau.
But that isn't what we're talking about anymore, is it?
Now you're talking about a war meant to be won.
You convinced them.
Convinced Scott, his wife, their people, our people, even Silver.
But not you.
Everyone's wrong but you.
Maybe.
Captain!
Masts!
Captain.
Ocracoke Island.
Teach is there.
A few hours' time, assuming he's there,
I'm going to begin a discussion in which I'm going to ask him for something that he can't possibly give.
And the success or failure of this war will depend upon the outcome.
In a few hours' time, there's a good chance you're going to look awfully smart.
What are you doing?
Bring him down!
You look good.
As handsome as ever.
You always were a gifted liar.
When you were still pirating,
I was the woman who was Blackbeard's woman.
Put my services in great demand-- all men wanting what notorious men already had.
And then you leave and my business fades.
It's always the little people who get hurt the worst when the market turns.
So when are you going to tell me?
Tell you what?
What he's doing here.
Charles?
I remember when he had forced you from Nassau.
I remember how angry you were, how disappointed.
And I remember you telling me that you'd never make the same mistake again, that you had learned the hard way that only God made sons.
Things are different now.
Different how?
Doesn't need to last long.
A little Spanish shrapnel.
It went in here when I was not much older than him.
Once in a while it migrates, ticks closer to reaching its terminus and striking its chime.
Grim little timepiece whose ticking has grown louder to my ears of late.
Charles doesn't know, does he?
Captain!
Jesus.
Welcome to Ocracoke.
At first I was tempted, but in the end it felt wrong to betray the governor that way.
And it felt dangerous... so I declined.
Then how did this happen?
How does an honest chambermaid end up in the employ of the Spanish empire?
A few days after I declined their offer...
I came home late from the governor's service.
It wasn't unusual for me to return home to find my children long since fast asleep.
That night, my children were not alone.
The man who had approached me-
Grandal-- was there... waiting.
In his left hand, a knife.
In his right, a purse.
He said my children would receive something from him that night.
He asked me to choose which.
These are the people whom I am beholden to.
This is what they are capable of doing.
I cannot imagine what they will do if the cache is not returned whole.
Ship's manifest, sir.
The entirety of the gold from the fort is now stowed and ready for transport to Havana.
We should be under way within the hour.
Put it in my office, please.
I just left Miss Hudson.
I had the instinct once or twice, the way she'd been watching me of late.
I dismissed it, just assumed it related to some concern over my relationship with you and its becoming inappropriate.
What did she say?
Did she report that we're earnestly attempting to find and return the missing money?
It's not about the money for them, not anymore.
When the gold from the Urca was stolen, it was bad enough.
Now they hear the gold is being converted into something more easily hidden from them, more easily smuggled away.
That isn't theft.
It's an insult.
And insults to empires require answers.
So it's personal, then?
A binary question of my trustworthiness.
Either I return the full cache and prove it or I fail, and in trying to excuse the shortfall, only aggravate their existing suspicion that I am part of the pirate problem, not its solution.
And the dread fleet in Havana sets sail the very next day to raze all of Nassau to the ground.
Then we'll fight them, defend the island.
The odds would be dire, but we are not without resources.
No, not "we."
I mean, someone might fight them, but it won't be you and I.
If the result of my endeavor here is a Spanish attack against British forces, an act that threatens to drag the empire into a war,
I would be recalled to London and likely debtors' prison and your capital sentence would be reinstated.
Now, I believe Nassau's best chance at survival is with me guiding it.
But if we cannot find Jack Rackham and Anne Bonny, if we can't find the cache in their possession, whatever happens to Nassau, you and I are likely finished.
Pardon me, gentlemen, if you don't mind me asking, where is this wagon headed?
To the fort.
To do what, exactly?
To fix it.
I see.
Just you two on the job, is it?
A whole gang of us up there.
Governor wants it shipshape by the end of the month.
Suppose that fort's not going to rebuild itself.
No, I suppose it won't.
Hold still.
There.
Well?
What do you think?
You mean aside from the tit curtains?
It's called a cravat.
You want to fit in with them, right?
This is what they wear.
"They" who?
Respectable men.
All right, yeah.
Place of birth?
Bristol.
Occupation?
Ship's carpenter.
Ship served?
I used to serve the Buccaneer.
Sign here.
Move on.
Next?
What the fuck are you doing here?
It's a cravat.
It's what respectable men wear.
It's-- never mind what it is.
You're supposed to be long gone by now.
Why'd you come back?
Where we're going, it seemed better to have one of these than not.
I thought as an added prize,
I'd at least be able to see it for myself, the new governor up to his ears in the very same bullshit in which I've been drowning for the past few months.
And what do I find?
The streets are swept, industry is in fashion, you're dressed like a Turkish whore, and all because a man arrived, stood on the beach, and said please.
You're angry.
I'm confounded.
He offers them less in wages than I offered, demands more from them in labor, restricts more from them in license, and yet despite all of that, he's won them.
How can that be?
I know it may be hard to believe given my appearance at the moment, but the experience of it?
It ain't half bad, Jack.
Next.
Next man, please.
Your legal name?
John Rackham.
What?
The Lord Governor would like a word with you.
Watch him, please.
I'll go fetch Fremah to tend to him.
I said no.
I know you did.
I don't want help.
It'll pass.
I'll just find a place to weather it for the night.
I understand that you do not want anyone to see you this way.
What I don't understand is why you choose to suffer in the first place.
You must have access to better medicines than that.
We've got access to better medicines than that.
This has nothing to do with medicine.
It has something to do with medicine--
I cannot look weak.
I cannot feel weak.
I cannot be weak.
Not in front of my men.
Not in front of your men.
Not at all.
For some time now, I have been holding my entire world together with both hands, keeping my men in line, seeing to their needs, and the only way that endures is if I look the part.
And I cannot look the part while being poked and prodded or while drooling through an opium haze saying who the fuck knows what.
So I will endure this the way I have been enduring it.
No one prepared you for this, did they?
For as long as I can remember,
I have been prepared for the day
I would take my mother's place.
To know that from that day forth,
I would forever be the one who tends as opposed to the one who is tended to.
You're frustrated.
You're angry.
You're tired.
Perhaps no one else knows why.
I believe that not even you know why.
But I know why.
The crown is always a burden... but it cannot be borne if you cannot stand.
Nearly dismasted in a storm-- a storm you chased after.
Nearly starved to death in the doldrums.
Nearly executed by them.
Either you are unkillable, friend, or way overdue.
One way or another, I am here, and there is much to discuss about all our futures.
What kind of future do you propose that to be?
I intend to gather forces and move to reclaim Nassau.
The conquest is always weakest when the conqueror allows himself to believe that it is done.
For Nassau, that point is now.
Now, England may hold the island, but it still needs supplies brought in.
It is still dependent upon trade.
We will make that impossible for him.
We will harass his ships.
We will plunder his supplies.
We will force him to bleed capital and support and the goodwill of the men surrounding him until he is weak enough to challenge directly.
Until we can bring the fleet to bear and retake the bay.
You know, when I called Nassau home, most of the men on this beach weren't even men.
I sailed with Ben Hornigold.
I sailed with Sam Bellamy.
I sailed with Henry Avery.
Feuded with them, stole from them, questioned their motives, but we all knew what we were.
Then a man arrives who would explain to us that what we've been doing was wrong all those years, what Nassau ought to be, what he could make it if we would all just follow his lead.
And here you are again to do the same.
You let it go well before its time.
It was past its time.
That you cannot see this only makes it clearer to me that you never even knew it in the first place.
This fleet is all that remains of it, and as long as it's mine, Nassau shall remain in its past.
It isn't yours.
It never was.
Those ships, their commanders and crews, they were pledged to my command, not yours.
Oaths were taken, and I have come to see them honored.
Do you honestly believe that I would just step aside and let you make that claim?
I honestly don't give a shit what you would or would not do.
The decision isn't yours.
It's his.
I've come to resume our compact, the one we swore upon our lives to uphold.
If you stand up and acknowledge it, this fleet will follow us.
I'm certain of it.
You weren't there.
No, I wasn't.
But had I been there, there would be no question about any of this.
Had I been there, we would have mounted the defense that we had agreed to mount.
Had you been there, you would have seen their faces, the ones who laid their arms down and turned their backs on us.
The ones who took our money for months and were happy to try and deliver my head to our enemies for a little more of it.
Nassau is dead.
It doesn't deserve anything else from me or the men on this beach.
We are finally free from it, and I see no reason to change that.
If you wish to leave this place, I'll allow it, although somehow I don't think you have any intention of leaving.
No, I don't.
And I think you know that I would never allow you to call a vote to settle the matter of who this fleet follows and risk you depleting my force by luring away some misguided minority.
No, I don't imagine you would.
So we have one fleet and two men claiming it.
There is only one way I know of to resolve that.
Pistols, then swords.
Captain Rackham.
It's a pleasure to finally meet you.
Give us the room, please.
Drink?
Thank you.
I apologize for the strangeness of this meeting.
I know you and I don't know each other.
I know you... some.
I read your book.
Did you?
Well, most of it.
I confess, I may not quite have soldiered through to the end.
But, you know, I got the gist of it.
If you don't mind my asking, what did you take to be its gist?
Wealthy son of a wealthy man takes to the sea to prove something to the parents, presumably.
Seeks adventure, finds the limits of his own capacity.
Loses everything in the process and then stumbles upon a hell of a story in the process.
Please understand, I'm quite particular about my library, but people seem to have liked it fine, and it seems to have done wonders for you.
So congratulations on all that.
Thank you.
All of that not withstanding... you and I share an experience in this place.
And as such, I'm hopeful that you'll understand why it is I brought you here today and what it is I'm about to ask of you.
What's that?
I know you removed a significant amount of gold from the fort.
I know it is in your possession, and I need you to give it up... or we're all dead.
You can't win.
I hear you spent weeks becalmed, deprived of food and water.
At your best, it would have been a dogfight, but diminished...
I'm not that diminished.
He's been off the account for years.
He'll be more vulnerable than he remembers himself being.
He's not that vulnerable.
And for what?
You subject yourself to certain death for an island full of weaklings and ingrates?
Those men will go where they are led.
Rogers captured their minds before you could, but let's not pretend that they can't be won again.
And let's not pretend that either of us believes for a moment that I'm doing this for their sakes.
I gave you my word.
Shook your hand.
Pledged to defend the island with you.
But my pledge to him began a long time before I ever knew your name.
What I owe him-- I don't care.
I don't care that you shook my hand.
I don't care what you feel you owe him.
This is too important to be clouded by any of that.
They took my home.
I can't walk away from that.
Can you?
Forget me, forget Teach, forget loyalty, compacts, honor, debts, all of it.
The only question that matters is this.
Who are you?
Spain knows about the exchanges?
They do, and they are displeased.
How do you know they know?
So what does that look like?
Return it all or it's the Rosario raid all over again?
Something like that.
I understand why you did it.
I know what it feels like to lose everything and feel powerless to do anything about it.
The temptation to keep something to show for it all,
I understand it.
But it does not change the reality we face.
That you face.
For I assure you, if Spain invades over this, yours will be the first face they see.
I heard Henry Avery's name when I was a boy, heard the way people spoke it-- grown men in awe of it.
I came to this place so determined to do the same.
That's not going to happen the way I thought it was, is it?
It never does.
My advice?
You want some say in how they speak of you?
Write a book.
Right now, what do you want to do?
Do you have a pen?
He's agreed to cooperate.
One man goes into the interior to deliver this, instructions written in his hand to his partner to return to Nassau and surrender the cache.
He said she may be wary, asked there be only one messenger to deliver the letter.
Give this to Lieutenant Hersey.
Have him prepare to depart for the interior.
I'll pass him details momentarily.
He should be made aware Anne will not be taken lightly.
Well, neither will Lieutenant Hersey.
I understand Jack was arrested today.
I would like to know why.
What happens if he loses?
If he loses, he dies.
I meant what happens to us?
I don't know.
Probably given a chance to join the fleet, fold in, and go back on the account.
When your men entreated me to join your crew, they said your captain was a man worth following.
A strong man, a wise man, they said.
But right now I can't tell which side of this contest you'd prefer to see prevail.
Can you help me make sense of that?
A few days ago I could make sense of all of it.
He was going to die and we were going to be free, from the account, from him...
With all the shit he's done, the things he's gotten away with, that would have been fair.
That would have been right.
I think part of the reason
I've been able to stand by his side is that I wanted to make sure I've got a good view of the moment the world finally catches up to him... and this story starts to make sense again.
This is a matter of honor to be settled once and for good in the here and now.
The parties have agreed to combat and have accepted common practice.
The parties have further agreed there will be no quarter asked nor given.
Cock your pistols!
From this moment, there's to be no movement untila countof three.
One... two... three!
Take him.
And get the fuck off my beach.
If you won't take the opium, at least take this to bite down on.
Just do it.
The burden I wasn't prepared for it isn't the men.
It's him.
Flint?
What he wants, what he needs, what he fears... the depths of it... they are profound and dark.
I serve the crew best by tempering him, steering him where he's needed.
I've descended into those depths and connected with him so that I might be able to do so.
But I am acutely aware that I'm not the first to have been there... to have been a partner to him in this way.
And that the ones that have seen those depths before... they never surfaced again.
Maybe their mistake was in trying to do it alone.
Maybe to go to such a place, one needs another to hold the tether and to find a way out.
Maybe.
I know this cannot have been easy for you.
I know this is so far from how you thought things would end.
But I wanted you to know that the end of this may not quite be what you think it is.
How's that?
When Anne receives your letter and returns here with what remains of the cache,
Nassau will be secured, and everyone will know that it is because of Jack Rackham that it occurred.
I'll have spared Nassau... and you think the story of it will be told long after I am gone?
I know it will.
I will make sure of it.
Sounds a lifeless story to me, and one that requires commitments before the fact to ensure its retelling.
When the current story unfolds, I assure you, it's going to get around all on its own.
What does that mean?
I walked intothis place today stunned at how quickly that man downstairs had completed his conquest, how thoroughly he had seemed to win just about everyone I know over to his side.
The truth of the matter is there's been no conquest.
It's only the appearance of one.
For conquest is an either/or proposition.
Either you have it or you do not.
It would appear that without that cache, he most certainly does not.
Jack, what did you do?
I sent word to Anne to take the cache and disappear.
No.
The governor saw your letter to her.
You don't think I can convey a thought to Anne comprehensible only to her?
A thought as simple as "run"?
A letter that said everything the governor wished it to say in exactly the way he'd want to say it would not sound like anything I'd ever say.
A thought here or two between the lines--
I assure you, she understood.
So I have begun the duel between myself and our Lord Governor.
The rules are simple.
I will deny him the cache.
No matter what sort of inducements he offers or pain he inflicts,
I will deny him the cache, and so I will deny him the victory.
And in doing so, I will ensure that whatever Nassau is come Christmas,
English will be not it.
Do not do this.
It's done.
So, one of two outcomes will result.
Rogers will understand his defeat to be ultimately inevitable and leave this place, in which case I'll have it back.
Or he'll stubbornly refuse and eventually Spain will raze this place to the ground.
The English flag will burn, and a second pirate republic will be born from the ashes of the first.
Only this time, every man who calls it home will know it came about because of me.
I worry... that we have made a terrible mistake.
I see what you see in them--
Silver and Flint.
But their relationship is so volatile and we have put our lives in their hands.
Those men rose to their stations because they are peerless when it comes to shaping the world to their will, in creating a narrative and wielding it to compel men's hearts and minds.
But the most compelling story requires a villain at its center.
And if either Captain Flint or Mr. Silver sees the other as a villain-- or worse... us as that-- then all is lost.
They are of great value to us, but they must be managed by us to avoid that outcome.
How?
I wish... you and I had not been so separate all those years.
I wish I could have found a way to be a better father to you.
But over time, I was determined to leave you something behind, to give you the one thing that no one could ever take away... and that would make you strong enough to understand their world, interact with their world... wage war on their world.
But if their identity lies in their stories,
I wanted you to know them so that when we are ready to call them enemies, you would be ready for it.
The villain makes the story.
So to manage our current partners, we must ensure that we all agree at all times who our common villain is.
The fugitive's name is Anne Bonny.
She's going for a capture of £500.
...several miles away on the road out of town.
Earlier today, before we knew Rackham was still on the island, you seemed confident that we could locate him and his friend in time.
You said it was possible because they didn't know that we were looking for them.
Why do I get the feeling, now that they do know, now that they've made it their personal crusade to see this regime fail, that your estimate will be far less optimistic?
The militia will help.
It will keep the pressure on, and perhaps we'll get lucky.
Butifwe don't,thenyoumayhave tobeprepared--
Oh, I'm prepared to do anything.
Anne Bonny must be found.
The cache must be found.
Right now, that is all that matters.
And that said, the goodwill that we have engendered among the people of Nassau is not without limits.
The longer this drags out, the riskier it becomes, because if I find that money only to lose the street--
You will not.
If you have me, then you have the street.
I am all the reassurance they need.
Yes, Jack and Anne were my partners, my friends.
More.
But now they have made themselves something else to me.
I have sacrificed too much to build something here.
I will not let them take it away.
All he ever did was offer me his friendship.
I cast him aside once, spent years regretting it.
And now here we are again.
Tell me I didn't do it for nothing.
Well, I won't lie to you.
It would have helped having the fleet.
We have assets, we have allies.
The question is what we make of them.
I may be able to help in that regard.
Something to add to our pool of assets.
Before Ocracoke, we came upon a prize-- a Spanish prize ferrying a significant trove of intelligence.
Most of it was destroyed by the time we found it, but among the remains was one piece of information, something everyone else was quick to dismiss as it held no value to them in that moment.
Information about what?
Money... separated from the Urca gold within the fort and rendered into a new form-- a cache of gems for which Spain is holding the new governor accountable.
A cache which, if used creatively, could be the key to defeating British forces in Nassau.
The only question is, can we find it before he does?
I was approached by the intelligence department of the Casa de Contratación.
They offered me a significant amount of money.
I said yes.
The department's spies had learned of an attempt to walk away with their money without them knowing of it.
If you do not return the entirety of the hidden cache, know that Nassau will likely burn for it.
With everything I've lost in recent days,
I can't afford to lose the name, too.
We walk into the tavern, we sign our names, and then not only are we square with the law our money is, too.
The wound should be far further along towards quietening itself.
If the decay progresses,
I'll have to remove more of your leg.
What does a colonial power do when they see a sitting governor deposed by an alliance of pirates and slaves bring down Nassau?
Maybe bring it all down.
What happens now?
Now we go find Charles Vane.
Where is he?
When you said that you'd be staying behind to solidify our new compact,
I assumed that meant something.
For you to be seen as uninterested in what is happening for my father now, that is not going to help convince anyone here that you are serious about desiring their friendship.
It'll pass.
It's just a fever from the wound.
I'm fine.
Christ!
I'm all right!
Swing it down on deck!
Fucking idiot!
Listen, if you can't tie a rope, you shouldn't be on this ship!
Get astern.
Calm down!
Hey!
What's going on here?
His lashing came undone.
I fucking showed it to him 10 minutes ago.
Someone could have been killed.
Then you showed him incorrectly.
It's a fucking lashing.
I know how to tie it.
If he tied it wrong, then you instructed him wrong.
You listen to me.
We persuaded them that they need us.
We most certainly need them.
Do you understand what I'm saying?
Don't imagine that will be the last of those.
Neither do I.
So how exactly do you see this working?
They have their orders.
As long as we hold our end of the bargain, they'll hold.
Yeah, that wasn't what I meant.
I understood a war meant to antagonize England to frighten them, to prevent them from moving against Nassau.
But that isn't what we're talking about anymore, is it?
Now you're talking about a war meant to be won.
You convinced them.
Convinced Scott, his wife, their people, our people, even Silver.
But not you.
Everyone's wrong but you.
Maybe.
Captain!
Masts!
Captain.
Ocracoke Island.
Teach is there.
A few hours' time, assuming he's there,
I'm going to begin a discussion in which I'm going to ask him for something that he can't possibly give.
And the success or failure of this war will depend upon the outcome.
In a few hours' time, there's a good chance you're going to look awfully smart.
What are you doing?
Bring him down!
You look good.
As handsome as ever.
You always were a gifted liar.
When you were still pirating,
I was the woman who was Blackbeard's woman.
Put my services in great demand all men wanting what notorious men already had.
And then you leave and my business fades.
It's always the little people who get hurt the worst when the market turns.
So when are you going to tell me?
Tell you what?
What he's doing here.
Charles?
I remember when he had forced you from Nassau.
I remember how angry you were, how disappointed.
And I remember you telling me that you'd never make the same mistake again, that you had learned the hard way that only God made sons.
Things are different now.
Different how?
Doesn't need to last long.
A little Spanish shrapnel.
It went in here when I was not much older than him.
Once in a while it migrates, ticks closer to reaching its terminus and striking its chime.
Grim little timepiece whose ticking has grown louder to my ears of late.
Charles doesn't know, does he?

A whole gang of us up there.
Governor wants it shipshape by the end of the month.
Suppose that fort's not going to rebuild itself.
No, I suppose it won't.
Hold still.
There.
Well?
What do you think?
You mean aside from the tit curtains?
It's called a cravat.
You want to fit in with them, right?
This is what they wear.
"They" who?
Respectable men.
All right, yeah.
Place of birth?
Bristol.
Occupation?
Ship's carpenter.
Ship served?
I used to serve the Buccaneer.
Sign here.
Move on.
Next?
What the fuck are you doing here?
It's a cravat.
It's what respectable men wear.
It's... never mind what it is.
You're supposed to be long gone by now.
Why'd you come back?
Where we're going, it seemed better to have one of these than not.
I thought as an added prize,
I'd at least be able to see it for myself, the new governor up to his ears in the very same bullshit in which I've been drowning for the past few months.
And what do I find?
The streets are swept, industry is in fashion, you're dressed like a Turkish whore, and all because a man arrived, stood on the beach, and said please.
You're angry.
I'm confounded.
He offers them less in wages than I offered, demands more from them in labor, restricts more from them in license, and yet despite all of that, he's won them.
How can that be?
I know it may be hard to believe given my appearance at the moment, but the experience of it?
It ain't half bad, Jack.
Next.
Next man, please.
Your legal name?
John Rackham.
What?
The Lord Governor would like a word with you.
Watch him, please.
I'll go fetch Fremah to tend to him.
I said no.
I know you did.
I don't want help.
It'll pass.
I'll just find a place to weather it for the night.
I understand that you do not want anyone to see you this way.
What I don't understand is why you choose to suffer in the first place.
You must have access to better medicines than that.
We've got access to better medicines than that.
This has nothing to do with medicine.
It has something to do with medicine...
I cannot look weak.
I cannot feel weak.
I cannot be weak.
Not in front of my men.
Not in front of your men.
Not at all.
For some time now, I have been holding my entire world together with both hands, keeping my men in line, seeing to their needs, and the only way that endures is if I look the part.
And I cannot look the part while being poked and prodded or while drooling through an opium haze saying who the fuck knows what.
So I will endure this the way I have been enduring it.
No one prepared you for this, did they?
For as long as I can remember,
I have been prepared for the day
I would take my mother's place.
To know that from that day forth,
I would forever be the one who tends as opposed to the one who is tended to.
You're frustrated.
You're angry.
You're tired.
Perhaps no one else knows why.
I believe that not even you know why.
But I know why.
The crown is always a burden... but it cannot be borne if you cannot stand.
Nearly dismasted in a storm... a storm you chased after.
Nearly starved to death in the doldrums.
Nearly executed by them.
Either you are unkillable, friend, or way overdue.
One way or another, I am here, and there is much to discuss about all our futures.
What kind of future do you propose that to be?
I intend to gather forces and move to reclaim Nassau.
The conquest is always weakest when the conqueror allows himself to believe that it is done.
For Nassau, that point is now.
Now, England may hold the island, but it still needs supplies brought in.
It is still dependent upon trade.
We will make that impossible for him.
We will harass his ships.
We will plunder his supplies.
We will force him to bleed capital and support and the goodwill of the men surrounding him until he is weak enough to challenge directly.
Until we can bring the fleet to bear and retake the bay.
You know, when I called Nassau home, most of the men on this beach weren't even men.
I sailed with Ben Hornigold.
I sailed with Sam Bellamy.
I sailed with Henry Avery.
Feuded with them, stole from them, questioned their motives, but we all knew what we were.
Then a man arrives who would explain to us that what we've been doing was wrong all those years, what Nassau ought to be, what he could make it if we would all just follow his lead.
And here you are again to do the same.
You let it go well before its time.
It was past its time.
That you cannot see this only makes it clearer to me that you never even knew it in the first place.
This fleet is all that remains of it, and as long as it's mine, Nassau shall remain in its past.
It isn't yours.
It never was.
Those ships, their commanders and crews, they were pledged to my command, not yours.
Oaths were taken, and I have come to see them honored.
Do you honestly believe that I would just step aside and let you make that claim?
I honestly don't give a shit what you would or would not do.
The decision isn't yours.
It's his.
I've come to resume our compact, the one we swore upon our lives to uphold.
If you stand up and acknowledge it, this fleet will follow us.
I'm certain of it.
You weren't there.
No, I wasn't.
But had I been there, there would be no question about any of this.
Had I been there, we would have mounted the defense that we had agreed to mount.
Had you been there, you would have seen their faces, the ones who laid their arms down and turned their backs on us.
The ones who took our money for months and were happy to try and deliver my head to our enemies for a little more of it.
Nassau is dead.
It doesn't deserve anything else from me or the men on this beach.
We are finally free from it, and I see no reason to change that.
If you wish to leave this place, I'll allow it, although somehow I don't think you have any intention of leaving.
No, I don't.
And I think you know that I would never allow you to call a vote to settle the matter of who this fleet follows and risk you depleting my force by luring away some misguided minority.
No, I don't imagine you would.
So we have one fleet and two men claiming it.
There is only one way I know of to resolve that.
Pistols, then swords.
Captain Rackham.
It's a pleasure to finally meet you.
Give us the room, please.
Drink?
Thank you.
I apologize for the strangeness of this meeting.
I know you and I don't know each other.
I know you... some.
I read your book.
Did you?
Well, most of it.
I confess, I may not quite have soldiered through to the end.
But, you know, I got the gist of it.
If you don't mind my asking, what did you take to be its gist?
Wealthy son of a wealthy man takes to the sea to prove something to the parents, presumably.
Seeks adventure, finds the limits of his own capacity.
Loses everything in the process and then stumbles upon a hell of a story in the process.
Please understand, I'm quite particular about my library, but people seem to have liked it fine, and it seems to have done wonders for you.
So congratulations on all that.
Thank you.
All of that notwithstanding... you and I share an experience in this place.
And as such, I'm hopeful that you'll understand why it is I brought you here today and what it is I'm about to ask of you.
What's that?
I know you removed a significant amount of gold from the fort.
I know it is in your possession, and I need you to give it up... or we're all dead.
You can't win.
I hear you spent weeks becalmed, deprived of food and water.
At your best, it would have been a dogfight, but diminished...
I'm not that diminished.
He's been off the account for years.
He'll be more vulnerable than he remembers himself being.
He's not that vulnerable.
And for what?
You subject yourself to certain death for an island full of weaklings and ingrates?
Those men will go where they are led.
Rogers captured their minds before you could, but let's not pretend that they can't be won again.
And let's not pretend that either of us believes for a moment that I'm doing this for their sakes.
I gave you my word.
Shook your hand.
Pledged to defend the island with you.
But my pledge to him began a long time before I ever knew your name.
What I owe him...
I don't care.
I don't care that you shook my hand.
I don't care what you feel you owe him.
This is too important to be clouded by any of that.
They took my home.
I can't walk away from that.
Can you?
Forget me, forget Teach, forget loyalty, compacts, honor, debts, all of it.
The only question that matters is this.
Who are you?
Spain knows about the exchanges?
They do, and they are displeased.
How do you know they know?
So what does that look like?
Return it all or it's the Rosario raid all over again?
Something like that.
I understand why you did it.
I know what it feels like to lose everything and feel powerless to do anything about it.
The temptation to keep something to show for it all,
I understand it.
But it does not change the reality we face.
That you face.
For I assure you, if Spain invades over this, yours will be the first face they see.
I heard Henry Avery's name when I was a boy, heard the way people spoke it... grown men in awe of it.
I came to this place so determined to do the same.
That's not going to happen the way I thought it was, is it?
It never does.
My advice?
You want some say in how they speak of you?
Write a book.
Right now, what do you want to do?
Do you have a pen?
He's agreed to cooperate.
One man goes into the interior to deliver this, instructions written in his hand to his partner to return to Nassau and surrender the cache.
He said she may be wary, asked there be only one messenger to deliver the letter.
Give this to Lieutenant Hersey.
Have him prepare to depart for the interior.
I'll pass him details momentarily.
He should be made aware Anne will not be taken lightly.
Well, neither will Lieutenant Hersey.
I understand Jack was arrested today.
I would like to know why.
What happens if he loses?
If he loses, he dies.
I meant what happens to us?
I don't know.
Probably given a chance to join the fleet, fold in, and go back on the account.
When your men entreated me to join your crew, they said your captain was a man worth following.
A strong man, a wise man, they said.
But right now I can't tell which side of this contest you'd prefer to see prevail.
Can you help me make sense of that?
A few days ago I could make sense of all of it.
He was going to die and we were going to be free, from the account, from him...
With all the shit he's done, the things he's gotten away with, that would have been fair.
That would have been right.
I think part of the reason
I've been able to stand by his side is that I wanted to make sure I've got a good view of the moment the world finally catches up to him... and this story starts to make sense again.
This is a matter of honor to be settled once and for good in the here and now.
The parties have agreed to combat and have accepted common practice.
The parties have further agreed there will be no quarter asked nor given.
Cock your pistols!
From this moment, there's to be no movement until a count of three.
One... two... three!
Take him.
And get the fuck off my beach.
If you won't take the opium, at least take this to bite down on.
Just do it.
The burden I wasn't prepared for... it isn't the men.
It's him.
Flint?
What he wants, what he needs, what he fears... the depths of it... they are profound and dark.
I serve the crew best by tempering him, steering him where he's needed.
I've descended into those depths and connected with him so that I might be able to do so.
But I am acutely aware that I'm not the first to have been there... to have been a partner to him in this way.
And that the ones that have seen those depths before... they never surfaced again.
Maybe their mistake was in trying to do it alone.
Maybe to go to such a place, one needs another to hold the tether and to find a way out.
Maybe.
I know this cannot have been easy for you.
I know this is so far from how you thought things would end.
But I wanted you to know that the end of this may not quite be what you think it is.
How's that?
When Anne receives your letter and returns here with what remains of the cache,
Nassau will be secured, and everyone will know that it is because of Jack Rackham that it occurred.
I'll have spared Nassau... and you think the story of it will be told long after I am gone?
I know it will.
I will make sure of it.
Sounds a lifeless story to me, and one that requires commitments before the fact to ensure its retelling.
When the current story unfolds, I assure you, it's going to get around all on its own.
What does that mean?
I walked into this place today stunned at how quickly that man downstairs had completed his conquest, how thoroughly he had seemed to win just about everyone I know over to his side.
The truth of the matter is there's been no conquest.
It's only the appearance of one.
For conquest is an either/or proposition.
Either you have it or you do not.
It would appear that without that cache, he most certainly does not.
Jack, what did you do?
I sent word to Anne to take the cache and disappear.
No.
The governor saw your letter to her.
You don't think I can convey a thought to Anne comprehensible only to her?
A thought as simple as "run"?
A letter that said everything the governor wished it to say in exactly the way he'd want to say it would not sound like anything I'd ever say.
A thought here or two between the lines...
I assure you, she understood.
So I have begun the duel between myself and our Lord Governor.
The rules are simple.
I will deny him the cache.
No matter what sort of inducements he offers or pain he inflicts,
I will deny him the cache, and so I will deny him the victory.
And in doing so, I will ensure that whatever Nassau is come Christmas,
English will be not it.
Do not do this.
It's done.
So, one of two outcomes will result.
Rogers will understand his defeat to be ultimately inevitable and leave this place, in which case I'll have it back.
Or he'll stubbornly refuse and eventually Spain will raze this place to the ground.
The English flag will burn, and a second pirate republic will be born from the ashes of the first.
Only this time, every man who calls it home will know it came about because of me.
I worry... that we have made a terrible mistake.
I see what you see in them...
Silver and Flint.
But their relationship is so volatile and we have put our lives in their hands.
Those men rose to their stations because they are peerless when it comes to shaping the world to their will, in creating a narrative and wielding it to compel men's hearts and minds.
But the most compelling story requires a villain at its center.
And if either Captain Flint or Mr. Silver sees the other as a villain... or worse... us as that... then all is lost.
They are of great value to us, but they must be managed by us to avoid that outcome.
How?
I wish... you and I had not been so separate all those years.
I wish I could have found a way to be a better father to you.
But over time, I was determined to leave you something behind, to give you the one thing that no one could ever take away... and that would make you strong enough to understand their world, interact with their world... wage war on their world.
But if their identity lies in their stories,
I wanted you to know them so that when we are ready to call them enemies, you would be ready for it.
The villain makes the story.
So to manage our current partners, we must ensure that we all agree at all times who our common villain is.
The fugitive's name is Anne Bonny.
She's going for a capture of £500.
... several miles away on the road out of town.
Earlier today, before we knew Rackham was still on the island, you seemed confident that we could locate him and his friend in time.
You said it was possible because they didn't know that we were looking for them.
Why do I get the feeling, now that they do know, now that they've made it their personal crusade to see this regime fail, that your estimate will be far less optimistic?
The militia will help.
It will keep the pressure on, and perhaps we'll get lucky.
But if we don't, then you may have to be prepared...
Oh, I'm prepared to do anything.
Anne Bonny must be found.
The cache must be found.
Right now, that is all that matters.
And that said, the goodwill that we have engendered among the people of Nassau is not without limits.
The longer this drags out, the riskier it becomes, because if I find that money only to lose the street...
You will not.
If you have me, then you have the street.
I am all the reassurance they need.
Yes, Jack and Anne were my partners, my friends.
More.
But now they have made themselves something else to me.
I have sacrificed too much to build something here.
I will not let them take it away.
All he ever did was offer me his friendship.
I cast him aside once, spent years regretting it.
And now here we are again.
Tell me I didn't do it for nothing.
Well, I won't lie to you.
It would have helped having the fleet.
We have assets, we have allies.
The question is what we make of them.
I may be able to help in that regard.
Something to add to our pool of assets.
Before Ocracoke, we came upon a prize... a Spanish prize ferrying a significant trove of intelligence.
Most of it was destroyed by the time we found it, but among the remains was one piece of information, something everyone else was quick to dismiss as it held no value to them in that moment.
Information about what?
Money... separated from the Urca gold within the fort and rendered into a new form... a cache of gems for which Spain is holding the new governor accountable.
A cache which, if used creatively, could be the key to defeating British forces in Nassau.
The only question is, can we find it before he does?

HUDSON:
About six months ago,
I was approached by the intelligence department of the Casa de Contratación.
They offered me a significant amount of money.
I said yes.
The department's spies had learned of an attempt to walk away with their money without them knowing of it.
If you do not return the entirety of the hidden cache, know that Nassau will likely burn for it.
With everything I've lost in recent days,
I can't afford to lose the name, too.
We walk into the tavern, we sign our names, and then not only are we square with the law our money is, too.
The wound should be far further along towards quietening itself.
If the decay progresses,
I'll have to remove more of your leg.
What does a colonial power do when they see a sitting governor deposed by an alliance of pirates and slaves bring down Nassau?
Maybe bring it all down.
What happens now?
Now we go find Charles Vane.

When you said that you'd be staying behind to solidify our new compact,
I assumed that meant something.
For you to be seen as uninterested in what is happening for my father now, that is not going to help convince anyone here that you are serious about desiring their friendship.
It'll pass.
It's just a fever from the wound.

Then you showed him incorrectly.

Don't imagine that will be the last of those.
Neither do I.
So how exactly do you see this working?
They have their orders.
As long as we hold our end of the bargain, they'll hold.
Yeah, that wasn't what I meant.
I understood a war meant to antagonize England to frighten them, to prevent them from moving against Nassau.
But that isn't what we're talking about anymore, is it?
Now you're talking about a war meant to be won.
You convinced them.
Convinced Scott, his wife, their people, our people, even Silver.
But not you.

Things are different now.
Different how?
Doesn't need to last long.
A little Spanish shrapnel.

HUDSON:
At first I was tempted, but in the end it felt wrong to betray the governor that way.
And it felt dangerous... so I declined.
Then how did this happen?
How does an honest chambermaid end up in the employ of the Spanish empire?
A few days after I declined their offer...
I came home late from the governor's service.
It wasn't unusual for me to return home to find my children long since fast asleep.
That night, my children were not alone.
The man who had approached me
Grandal... was there... waiting.
In his left hand, a knife.
In his right, a purse.
He said my children would receive something from him that night.
He asked me to choose which.
These are the people whom I am beholden to.
This is what they are capable of doing.
I cannot imagine what they will do if the cache is not returned whole.
Ship's manifest, sir.
The entirety of the gold from the fort is now stowed and ready for transport to Havana.
We should be under way within the hour.
Put it in my office, please.
I just left Miss Hudson.
I had the instinct once or twice, the way she'd been watching me of late.
I dismissed it, just assumed it related to some concern over my relationship with you and its becoming inappropriate.
What did she say?
Did she report that we're earnestly attempting to find and return the missing money?
It's not about the money for them, not anymore.
When the gold from the Urca was stolen, it was bad enough.
Now they hear the gold is being converted into something more easily hidden from them, more easily smuggled away.
That isn't theft.
It's an insult.
And insults to empires require answers.
So it's personal, then?
A binary question of my trustworthiness.
Either I return the full cache and prove it or I fail, and in trying to excuse the shortfall, only aggravate their existing suspicion that I am part of the pirate problem, not its solution.
And the dread fleet in Havana sets sail the very next day to raze all of Nassau to the ground.
Then we'll fight them, defend the island.
The odds would be dire, but we are not without resources.
No, not "we."
I mean, someone might fight them, but it won't be you and I.
If the result of my endeavor here is a Spanish attack against British forces, an act that threatens to drag the empire into a war,
I would be recalled to London and likely debtors' prison and your capital sentence would be reinstated.
Now, I believe Nassau's best chance at survival is with me guiding it.
But if we cannot find Jack Rackham and Anne Bonny, if we can't find the cache in their possession, whatever happens to Nassau, you and I are likely finished.
[metal clanging]
- [crowd chattering] - [chickens clucking]
Pardon me, gentlemen, if you don't mind me asking, where is this wagon headed?
To the fort.
To do what, exactly?
To fix it.
I see.
Just you two on the job, is it?
A whole gang of us up there.
Governor wants it shipshape by the end of the month.

Suppose that fort's not going to rebuild itself.
[scoffs] No, I suppose it won't.

It's what respectable men wear.
It's... never mind what it is.
You're supposed to be long gone by now.
Why'd you come back?
Where we're going, it seemed better to have one of these than not.
I thought as an added prize,
I'd at least be able to see it for myself, the new governor up to his ears in the very same bullshit in which I've been drowning for the past few months.
And what do I find?
The streets are swept, industry is in fashion, you're dressed like a Turkish whore, and all because a man arrived, stood on the beach, and said please.
- You're angry.
- I'm confounded.
He offers them less in wages than I offered, demands more from them in labor, restricts more from them in license, and yet despite all of that, he's won them.
How can that be?
I know it may be hard to believe given my appearance at the moment, but the experience of it?
It ain't half bad, Jack.
Next.
Next man, please.
Your legal name?
John Rackham.
What?
The Lord Governor would like a word with you.
- [people shouting in native language] - [breathing heavily]
Watch him, please.
I'll go fetch Fremah to tend to him.
I said no.
- I know you did.
- I don't want help.
It'll pass.
I'll just find a place to weather it for the night.
I understand that you do not want anyone to see you this way.
What I don't understand is why you choose to suffer in the first place.
You must have access to better medicines than that.
We've got access to better medicines than that.
This has nothing to do with medicine.
It has something to do with medicine...
I cannot look weak.
I cannot feel weak.
I cannot be weak.
Not in front of my men.
Not in front of your men.
Not at all.
For some time now, I have been holding my entire world together with both hands, keeping my men in line, seeing to their needs, and the only way that endures is if I look the part.
And I cannot look the part while being poked and prodded or while drooling through an opium haze saying who the fuck knows what.
So I will endure this the way I have been enduring it.
No one prepared you for this, did they?
[breathing heavily]
For as long as I can remember,
I have been prepared for the day
I would take my mother's place.
To know that from that day forth,
I would forever be the one who tends as opposed to the one who is tended to.
You're frustrated.
You're angry.
You're tired.
Perhaps no one else knows why.
I believe that not even you know why.
But I know why.
The crown is always a burden... but it cannot be borne if you cannot stand.
[waves crashing]
Nearly dismasted in a storm... a storm you chased after.
Nearly starved to death in the doldrums.
Nearly executed by them.
Either you are unkillable, friend, or way overdue.
One way or another, I am here, and there is much to discuss about all our futures.
What kind of future do you propose that to be?
I intend to gather forces and move to reclaim Nassau.
The conquest is always weakest when the conqueror allows himself to believe that it is done.
For Nassau, that point is now.
Now, England may hold the island, but it still needs supplies brought in.
It is still dependent upon trade.
We will make that impossible for him.
We will harass his ships.
We will plunder his supplies.
We will force him to bleed capital and support and the goodwill of the men surrounding him until he is weak enough to challenge directly.
Until we can bring the fleet to bear and retake the bay.
You know, when I called Nassau home, most of the men on this beach weren't even men.
I sailed with Ben Hornigold.
I sailed with Sam Bellamy.
I sailed with Henry Avery.
Feuded with them, stole from them, questioned their motives, but we all knew what we were.
Then a man arrives who would explain to us that what we've been doing was wrong all those years, what Nassau ought to be, what he could make it if we would all just follow his lead.
And here you are again to do the same.
You let it go well before its time.
It was past its time.
That you cannot see this only makes it clearer to me that you never even knew it in the first place.
This fleet is all that remains of it, and as long as it's mine, Nassau shall remain in its past.
It isn't yours.
It never was.
Those ships, their commanders and crews, they were pledged to my command, not yours.
Oaths were taken, and I have come to see them honored.
Do you honestly believe that I would just step aside and let you make that claim?
I honestly don't give a shit what you would or would not do.
The decision isn't yours.
It's his.
I've come to resume our compact, the one we swore upon our lives to uphold.
If you stand up and acknowledge it, this fleet will follow us.
I'm certain of it.
- You weren't there.
- No, I wasn't.
But had I been there, there would be no question about any of this.
Had I been there, we would have mounted the defense that we had agreed to mount.
Had you been there, you would have seen their faces, the ones who laid their arms down and turned their backs on us.
The ones who took our money for months and were happy to try and deliver my head to our enemies for a little more of it.
Nassau is dead.
It doesn't deserve anything else from me or the men on this beach.
We are finally free from it, and I see no reason to change that.
If you wish to leave this place, I'll allow it, although somehow I don't think you have any intention of leaving.
No, I don't.
And I think you know that I would never allow you to call a vote to settle the matter of who this fleet follows and risk you depleting my force by luring away some misguided minority.
No, I don't imagine you would.
So we have one fleet and two men claiming it.
There is only one way I know of to resolve that.
Pistols, then swords.
Captain Rackham.
It's a pleasure to finally meet you.
Give us the room, please.
Drink?
Thank you.
I apologize for the strangeness of this meeting.
I know you and I don't know each other.
[door closes]
I know you... some.
I read your book.
Did you?
Well, most of it.
I confess, I may not quite have soldiered through to the end.
But, you know, I got the gist of it.
If you don't mind my asking, what did you take to be its gist?
Wealthy son of a wealthy man takes to the sea to prove something to the parents, presumably.
Seeks adventure, finds the limits of his own capacity.
Loses everything in the process and then stumbles upon a hell of a story in the process.
Please understand, I'm quite particular about my library, but people seem to have liked it fine, and it seems to have done wonders for you.
So congratulations on all that.
Thank you.
All of that notwithstanding... you and I share an experience in this place.
And as such, I'm hopeful that you'll understand why it is I brought you here today and what it is I'm about to ask of you.
What's that?
I know you removed a significant amount of gold from the fort.
I know it is in your possession, and I need you to give it up... or we're all dead.
- [men muttering] - [seagulls screeching]
You can't win.
[grunts]
I hear you spent weeks becalmed, deprived of food and water.
At your best, it would have been a dogfight, but diminished...
I'm not that diminished.
He's been off the account for years.
He'll be more vulnerable than he remembers himself being.
He's not that vulnerable.
And for what?
You subject yourself to certain death for an island full of weaklings and ingrates?
Those men will go where they are led.
Rogers captured their minds before you could, but let's not pretend that they can't be won again.
And let's not pretend that either of us believes for a moment that I'm doing this for their sakes.
I gave you my word.
Shook your hand.
Pledged to defend the island with you.
But my pledge to him began a long time before I ever knew your name.
- What I owe him...
- I don't care.
I don't care that you shook my hand.
I don't care what you feel you owe him.
This is too important to be clouded by any of that.
They took my home.
I can't walk away from that.
Can you?
Forget me, forget Teach, forget loyalty, compacts, honor, debts, all of it.
The only question that matters is this.
Who are you?
Spain knows about the exchanges?
They do, and they are displeased.
How do you know they know?
So what does that look like?
Return it all or it's the Rosario raid all over again?
- [pouring]
- Something like that.
I understand why you did it.
I know what it feels like to lose everything and feel powerless to do anything about it.
The temptation to keep something to show for it all,
I understand it.
But it does not change the reality we face.
That you face.
For I assure you, if Spain invades over this, yours will be the first face they see.
I heard Henry Avery's name when I was a boy, heard the way people spoke it... grown men in awe of it.
I came to this place so determined to do the same.
That's not going to happen the way I thought it was, is it?
It never does.
My advice?
You want some say in how they speak of you?
Write a book.
[laughs]
Right now, what do you want to do?
Do you have a pen?
ROGERS:
He's agreed to cooperate.
One man goes into the interior to deliver this, instructions written in his hand to his partner to return to Nassau and surrender the cache.
He said she may be wary, asked there be only one messenger to deliver the letter.
Give this to Lieutenant Hersey.
Have him prepare to depart for the interior.
I'll pass him details momentarily.
He should be made aware Anne will not be taken lightly.
Well, neither will Lieutenant Hersey.
I understand Jack was arrested today.
I would like to know why.
[crowd chattering]
- [waves crashing] - [men chattering] [seagull screeching]
[man mutters]
What happens if he loses?
If he loses, he dies.
I meant what happens to us?
I don't know.
Probably given a chance to join the fleet, fold in, and go back on the account.
When your men entreated me to join your crew, they said your captain was a man worth following.
A strong man, a wise man, they said.
But right now I can't tell which side of this contest you'd prefer to see prevail.
Can you help me make sense of that?
[men muttering]
A few days ago I could make sense of all of it.
He was going to die and we were going to be free, from the account, from him... [sighs]
With all the shit he's done, the things he's gotten away with, that would have been fair.
That would have been right.
I think part of the reason
I've been able to stand by his side is that I wanted to make sure I've got a good view of the moment the world finally catches up to him... and this story starts to make sense again.
This is a matter of honor to be settled once and for good in the here and now.
The parties have agreed to combat and have accepted common practice.
The parties have further agreed there will be no quarter asked nor given.

SILVER:
The burden I wasn't prepared for... [distant drums beating]
SILVER: it isn't the men.
It's him.
Flint?
What he wants, what he needs, what he fears... the depths of it... they are profound and dark.
I serve the crew best by tempering him, steering him where he's needed.
I've descended into those depths and connected with him so that I might be able to do so.
But I am acutely aware that I'm not the first to have been there... to have been a partner to him in this way.
And that the ones that have seen those depths before... they never surfaced again.
Maybe their mistake was in trying to do it alone.
Maybe to go to such a place, one needs another to hold the tether and to find a way out.
Maybe.
[door opens]
I know this cannot have been easy for you.
I know this is so far from how you thought things would end.
But I wanted you to know that the end of this may not quite be what you think it is.
How's that?
When Anne receives your letter and returns here with what remains of the cache,
Nassau will be secured, and everyone will know that it is because of Jack Rackham that it occurred.
I'll have spared Nassau... and you think the story of it will be told long after I am gone?
I know it will.
I will make sure of it.
Sounds a lifeless story to me, and one that requires commitments before the fact to ensure its retelling.
When the current story unfolds, I assure you, it's going to get around all on its own.
What does that mean?
I walked into this place today stunned at how quickly that man downstairs had completed his conquest, how thoroughly he had seemed to win just about everyone I know over to his side.
The truth of the matter is there's been no conquest.
It's only the appearance of one.
For conquest is an either/or proposition.
Either you have it or you do not.
It would appear that without that cache, he most certainly does not.
Jack, what did you do?
I sent word to Anne to take the cache and disappear.
No.
The governor saw your letter to her.
You don't think I can convey a thought to Anne comprehensible only to her?
A thought as simple as "run"?
A letter that said everything the governor wished it to say in exactly the way he'd want to say it would not sound like anything I'd ever say.
A thought here or two between the lines...
I assure you, she understood.
So I have begun the duel between myself and our Lord Governor.
The rules are simple.
I will deny him the cache.
No matter what sort of inducements he offers or pain he inflicts,
I will deny him the cache, and so I will deny him the victory.
And in doing so, I will ensure that whatever Nassau is come Christmas,
English will be not it.
[silent]
Do not do this.
It's done.
RACKHAM:
So, one of two outcomes will result.
Rogers will understand his defeat to be ultimately inevitable and leave this place, in which case I'll have it back.
Or he'll stubbornly refuse and eventually Spain will raze this place to the ground.
The English flag will burn, and a second pirate republic will be born from the ashes of the first.
Only this time, every man who calls it home will know it came about because of me.
- [crickets chirping] - [people chattering in native language]
I worry... that we have made a terrible mistake.
I see what you see in them...
Silver and Flint.
But their relationship is so volatile and we have put our lives in their hands.
Those men rose to their stations because they are peerless when it comes to shaping the world to their will, in creating a narrative and wielding it to compel men's hearts and minds.
But the most compelling story requires a villain at its center.
And if either Captain Flint or Mr. Silver sees the other as a villain... or worse... us as that... then all is lost.
They are of great value to us, but they must be managed by us to avoid that outcome.
How?
I wish... you and I had not been so separate all those years.
I wish I could have found a way to be a better father to you.
But over time, I was determined to leave you something behind, to give you the one thing that no one could ever take away... and that would make you strong enough to understand their world, interact with their world... wage war on their world.
But if their identity lies in their stories,
I wanted you to know them so that when we are ready to call them enemies, you would be ready for it.
The villain makes the story.
So to manage our current partners, we must ensure that we all agree at all times who our common villain is.
MAN:
The fugitive's name is Anne Bonny.
She's going for a capture of £500.
[chattering]
MAN: ... several miles away on the road out of town.
[chatter continues] [horse neighs, hoofbeats depart]
Earlier today, before we knew Rackham was still on the island, you seemed confident that we could locate him and his friend in time.
You said it was possible because they didn't know that we were looking for them.
Why do I get the feeling, now that they do know, now that they've made it their personal crusade to see this regime fail, that your estimate will be far less optimistic?
The militia will help.
It will keep the pressure on, and perhaps we'll get lucky.
But if we don't, then you may have to be prepared...
Oh, I'm prepared to do anything.
Anne Bonny must be found.
The cache must be found.
Right now, that is all that matters.
And that said, the goodwill that we have engendered among the people of Nassau is not without limits.
The longer this drags out, the riskier it becomes, because if I find that money only to lose the street...
You will not.
If you have me, then you have the street.
I am all the reassurance they need.
Yes, Jack and Anne were my partners, my friends.
More.
But now they have made themselves something else to me.
I have sacrificed too much to build something here.
I will not let them take it away.
[bell ringing]
All he ever did was offer me his friendship.
I cast him aside once, spent years regretting it.
And now here we are again.
Tell me I didn't do it for nothing.
Well, I won't lie to you.
It would have helped having the fleet.
We have assets, we have allies.
The question is what we make of them.
I may be able to help in that regard.
Something to add to our pool of assets.
Before Ocracoke, we came upon a prize... a Spanish prize ferrying a significant trove of intelligence.
Most of it was destroyed by the time we found it, but among the remains was one piece of information, something everyone else was quick to dismiss as it held no value to them in that moment.
Information about what?
Money... separated from the Urca gold within the fort and rendered into a new form... a cache of gems for which Spain is holding the new governor accountable.
A cache which, if used creatively, could be the key to defeating British forces in Nassau.
The only question is, can we find it before he does?
♪
About six months ago,
I was approached by the intelligence department of the Casa de Contratación.
They offered me a significant amount of money.
I said yes.
The department's spies had learned of an attempt to walk away with their money without them knowing of it.
If you do not return the entirety of the hidden cache, know that Nassau will likely burn for it.
With everything I've lost in recent days,
I can't afford to lose the name, too.
We walk into the tavern, we sign our names, and then not only are we square with the law our money is, too.
The wound should be far further along towards quietening itself.
If the decay progresses,
I'll have to remove more of your leg.
What does a colonial power do when they see a sitting governor deposed by an alliance of pirates and slaves bring down Nassau?
Maybe bring it all down.
What happens now?
Now we go find Charles Vane.
Where is he?
When you said that you'd be staying behind to solidify our new compact,
I assumed that meant something.
For you to be seen as uninterested in what is happening for my father now, that is not going to help convince anyone here that you are serious about desiring their friendship.
It'll pass.
It's just a fever from the wound.
I'm fine.
Christ!
I'm all right!
Swing it down on deck!
Fucking idiot!
Listen, if you can't tie a rope, you shouldn't be on this ship!
Get astern.
Calm down!
Hey!
What's going on here?
His lashing came undone.
I fucking showed it to him 10 minutes ago.
Someone could have been killed.
Then you showed him incorrectly.
It's a fucking lashing.
I know how to tie it.
If he tied it wrong, then you instructed him wrong.
You listen to me.
We persuaded them that they need us.
We most certainly need them.
Do you understand what I'm saying?
Don't imagine that will be the last of those.
Neither do I.
So how exactly do you see this working?
They have their orders.
As long as we hold our end of the bargain, they'll hold.
Yeah, that wasn't what I meant.
I understood a war meant to antagonize England to frighten them, to prevent them from moving against Nassau.
But that isn't what we're talking about anymore, is it?
Now you're talking about a war meant to be won.
You convinced them.
Convinced Scott, his wife, their people, our people, even Silver.
But not you.
Everyone's wrong but you.
Maybe.
Captain!
Masts!
Captain.
Ocracoke Island.
Teach is there.
A few hours' time, assuming he's there,
I'm going to begin a discussion in which I'm going to ask him for something that he can't possibly give.
And the success or failure of this war will depend upon the outcome.
In a few hours' time, there's a good chance you're going to look awfully smart.
What are you doing?
Bring him down!
You look good.
As handsome as ever.
You always were a gifted liar.
When you were still pirating,
I was the woman who was Blackbeard's woman.
Put my services in great demand all men wanting what notorious men already had.
And then you leave and my business fades.
It's always the little people who get hurt the worst when the market turns.
So when are you going to tell me?
Tell you what?
What he's doing here.
Charles?
I remember when he had forced you from Nassau.
I remember how angry you were, how disappointed.
And I remember you telling me that you'd never make the same mistake again, that you had learned the hard way that only God made sons.
Things are different now.
Different how?
Doesn't need to last long.
A little Spanish shrapnel.
It went in here when I was not much older than him.
Once in a while it migrates, ticks closer to reaching its terminus and striking its chime.
Grim little timepiece whose ticking has grown louder to my ears of late.
Charles doesn't know, does he?
Captain!
Jesus.
Welcome to Ocracoke.
At first I was tempted, but in the end it felt wrong to betray the governor that way.
And it felt dangerous... so I declined.
Then how did this happen?
How does an honest chambermaid end up in the employ of the Spanish empire?
A few days after I declined their offer...
I came home late from the governor's service.
It wasn't unusual for me to return home to find my children long since fast asleep.
That night, my children were not alone.
The man who had approached me
Grandal... was there... waiting.
In his left hand, a knife.
In his right, a purse.
He said my children would receive something from him that night.
He asked me to choose which.
These are the people whom I am beholden to.
This is what they are capable of doing.
I cannot imagine what they will do if the cache is not returned whole.
Ship's manifest, sir.
The entirety of the gold from the fort is now stowed and ready for transport to Havana.
We should be under way within the hour.
Put it in my office, please.
I just left Miss Hudson.
I had the instinct once or twice, the way she'd been watching me of late.
I dismissed it, just assumed it related to some concern over my relationship with you and its becoming inappropriate.
What did she say?
Did she report that we're earnestly attempting to find and return the missing money?
It's not about the money for them, not anymore.
When the gold from the Urca was stolen, it was bad enough.
Now they hear the gold is being converted into something more easily hidden from them, more easily smuggled away.
That isn't theft.
It's an insult.
And insults to empires require answers.
So it's personal, then?
A binary question of my trustworthiness.
Either I return the full cache and prove it or I fail, and in trying to excuse the shortfall, only aggravate their existing suspicion that I am part of the pirate problem, not its solution.
And the dread fleet in Havana sets sail the very next day to raze all of Nassau to the ground.
Then we'll fight them, defend the island.
The odds would be dire, but we are not without resources.
No, not "we."
I mean, someone might fight them, but it won't be you and I.
If the result of my endeavor here is a Spanish attack against British forces, an act that threatens to drag the empire into a war,
I would be recalled to London and likely debtors' prison and your capital sentence would be reinstated.
Now, I believe Nassau's best chance at survival is with me guiding it.
But if we cannot find Jack Rackham and Anne Bonny, if we can't find the cache in their possession, whatever happens to Nassau, you and I are likely finished.
Pardon me, gentlemen, if you don't mind me asking, where is this wagon headed?
To the fort.
To do what, exactly?
To fix it.
I see.
Just you two on the job, is it?
A whole gang of us up there.
Governor wants it shipshape by the end of the month.
Suppose that fort's not going to rebuild itself.
No, I suppose it won't.
Hold still.
There.
Well?
What do you think?
You mean aside from the tit curtains?
It's called a cravat.
You want to fit in with them, right?
- This is what they wear.
- "They" who?
Respectable men.
All right, yeah.
Place of birth?
Bristol.
Occupation?
Ship's carpenter.
- Ship served?
- I used to serve the Buccaneer.
Sign here.
Move on.
Next?
What the fuck are you doing here?
It's a cravat.
It's what respectable men wear.
It's... never mind what it is.
You're supposed to be long gone by now.
Why'd you come back?
Where we're going, it seemed better to have one of these than not.
I thought as an added prize,
I'd at least be able to see it for myself, the new governor up to his ears in the very same bullshit in which I've been drowning for the past few months.
And what do I find?
The streets are swept, industry is in fashion, you're dressed like a Turkish whore, and all because a man arrived, stood on the beach, and said please.
- You're angry.
- I'm confounded.
He offers them less in wages than I offered, demands more from them in labor, restricts more from them in license, and yet despite all of that, he's won them.
How can that be?
I know it may be hard to believe given my appearance at the moment, but the experience of it?
It ain't half bad, Jack.
Next.
Next man, please.
Your legal name?
John Rackham.
What?
The Lord Governor would like a word with you.
Watch him, please.
I'll go fetch Fremah to tend to him.
I said no.
- I know you did.
- I don't want help.
It'll pass.
I'll just find a place to weather it for the night.
I understand that you do not want anyone to see you this way.
What I don't understand is why you choose to suffer in the first place.
You must have access to better medicines than that.
We've got access to better medicines than that.
This has nothing to do with medicine.
It has something to do with medicine...
I cannot look weak.
I cannot feel weak.
I cannot be weak.
Not in front of my men.
Not in front of your men.
Not at all.
For some time now, I have been holding my entire world together with both hands, keeping my men in line, seeing to their needs, and the only way that endures is if I look the part.
And I cannot look the part while being poked and prodded or while drooling through an opium haze saying who the fuck knows what.
So I will endure this the way I have been enduring it.
No one prepared you for this, did they?
For as long as I can remember,
I have been prepared for the day
I would take my mother's place.
To know that from that day forth,
I would forever be the one who tends as opposed to the one who is tended to.
You're frustrated.
You're angry.
You're tired.
Perhaps no one else knows why.
I believe that not even you know why.
But I know why.
The crown is always a burden... but it cannot be borne if you cannot stand.
Nearly dismasted in a storm... a storm you chased after.
Nearly starved to death in the doldrums.
Nearly executed by them.
Either you are unkillable, friend, or way overdue.
One way or another, I am here, and there is much to discuss about all our futures.
What kind of future do you propose that to be?
I intend to gather forces and move to reclaim Nassau.
The conquest is always weakest when the conqueror allows himself to believe that it is done.
For Nassau, that point is now.
Now, England may hold the island, but it still needs supplies brought in.
It is still dependent upon trade.
We will make that impossible for him.
We will harass his ships.
We will plunder his supplies.
We will force him to bleed capital and support and the goodwill of the men surrounding him until he is weak enough to challenge directly.
Until we can bring the fleet to bear and retake the bay.
You know, when I called Nassau home, most of the men on this beach weren't even men.
I sailed with Ben Hornigold.
I sailed with Sam Bellamy.
I sailed with Henry Avery.
Feuded with them, stole from them, questioned their motives, but we all knew what we were.
Then a man arrives who would explain to us that what we've been doing was wrong all those years, what Nassau ought to be, what he could make it if we would all just follow his lead.
And here you are again to do the same.
You let it go well before its time.
It was past its time.
That you cannot see this only makes it clearer to me that you never even knew it in the first place.
This fleet is all that remains of it, and as long as it's mine, Nassau shall remain in its past.
It isn't yours.
It never was.
Those ships, their commanders and crews, they were pledged to my command, not yours.
Oaths were taken, and I have come to see them honored.
Do you honestly believe that I would just step aside and let you make that claim?
I honestly don't give a shit what you would or would not do.
The decision isn't yours.
It's his.
I've come to resume our compact, the one we swore upon our lives to uphold.
If you stand up and acknowledge it, this fleet will follow us.
I'm certain of it.
- You weren't there.
- No, I wasn't.
But had I been there, there would be no question about any of this.
Had I been there, we would have mounted the defense that we had agreed to mount.
Had you been there, you would have seen their faces, the ones who laid their arms down and turned their backs on us.
The ones who took our money for months and were happy to try and deliver my head to our enemies for a little more of it.
Nassau is dead.
It doesn't deserve anything else from me or the men on this beach.
We are finally free from it, and I see no reason to change that.
If you wish to leave this place, I'll allow it, although somehow I don't think you have any intention of leaving.
No, I don't.
And I think you know that I would never allow you to call a vote to settle the matter of who this fleet follows and risk you depleting my force by luring away some misguided minority.
No, I don't imagine you would.
So we have one fleet and two men claiming it.
There is only one way I know of to resolve that.
Pistols, then swords.
Captain Rackham.
It's a pleasure to finally meet you.
Give us the room, please.
Drink?
Thank you.
I apologize for the strangeness of this meeting.
I know you and I don't know each other.
I know you... some.
I read your book.
Did you?
Well, most of it.
I confess, I may not quite have soldiered through to the end.
But, you know, I got the gist of it.
If you don't mind my asking, what did you take to be its gist?
Wealthy son of a wealthy man takes to the sea to prove something to the parents, presumably.
Seeks adventure, finds the limits of his own capacity.
Loses everything in the process and then stumbles upon a hell of a story in the process.
Please understand, I'm quite particular about my library, but people seem to have liked it fine, and it seems to have done wonders for you.
So congratulations on all that.
Thank you.
All of that notwithstanding... you and I share an experience in this place.
And as such, I'm hopeful that you'll understand why it is I brought you here today and what it is I'm about to ask of you.
What's that?
I know you removed a significant amount of gold from the fort.
I know it is in your possession, and I need you to give it up... or we're all dead.
You can't win.
I hear you spent weeks becalmed, deprived of food and water.
At your best, it would have been a dogfight, but diminished...
I'm not that diminished.
He's been off the account for years.
He'll be more vulnerable than he remembers himself being.
He's not that vulnerable.
And for what?
You subject yourself to certain death for an island full of weaklings and ingrates?
Those men will go where they are led.
Rogers captured their minds before you could, but let's not pretend that they can't be won again.
And let's not pretend that either of us believes for a moment that I'm doing this for their sakes.
I gave you my word.
Shook your hand.
Pledged to defend the island with you.
But my pledge to him began a long time before I ever knew your name.
- What I owe him...
- I don't care.
I don't care that you shook my hand.
I don't care what you feel you owe him.
This is too important to be clouded by any of that.
They took my home.
I can't walk away from that.
Can you?
Forget me, forget Teach, forget loyalty, compacts, honor, debts, all of it.
The only question that matters is this.
Who are you?
Spain knows about the exchanges?
They do, and they are displeased.
How do you know they know?
So what does that look like?
Return it all or it's the Rosario raid all over again?
Something like that.
I understand why you did it.
I know what it feels like to lose everything and feel powerless to do anything about it.
The temptation to keep something to show for it all,
I understand it.
But it does not change the reality we face.
That you face.
For I assure you, if Spain invades over this, yours will be the first face they see.
I heard Henry Avery's name when I was a boy, heard the way people spoke it... grown men in awe of it.
I came to this place so determined to do the same.
That's not going to happen the way I thought it was, is it?
It never does.
My advice?
You want some say in how they speak of you?
Write a book.
Right now, what do you want to do?
Do you have a pen?
He's agreed to cooperate.
One man goes into the interior to deliver this, instructions written in his hand to his partner to return to Nassau and surrender the cache.
He said she may be wary, asked there be only one messenger to deliver the letter.
Give this to Lieutenant Hersey.
Have him prepare to depart for the interior.
I'll pass him details momentarily.
He should be made aware Anne will not be taken lightly.
Well, neither will Lieutenant Hersey.
I understand Jack was arrested today.
I would like to know why.
What happens if he loses?
If he loses, he dies.
I meant what happens to us?
I don't know.
Probably given a chance to join the fleet, fold in, and go back on the account.
When your men entreated me to join your crew, they said your captain was a man worth following.
A strong man, a wise man, they said.
But right now I can't tell which side of this contest you'd prefer to see prevail.
Can you help me make sense of that?
A few days ago I could make sense of all of it.
He was going to die and we were going to be free, from the account, from him...
With all the shit he's done, the things he's gotten away with, that would have been fair.
That would have been right.
I think part of the reason
I've been able to stand by his side is that I wanted to make sure I've got a good view of the moment the world finally catches up to him... and this story starts to make sense again.
This is a matter of honor to be settled once and for good in the here and now.
The parties have agreed to combat and have accepted common practice.
The parties have further agreed there will be no quarter asked nor given.
Cock your pistols!
From this moment, there's to be no movement until a count of three.
One... two... three!
Take him.
And get the fuck off my beach.
If you won't take the opium, at least take this to bite down on.
Just do it.
The burden I wasn't prepared for... it isn't the men.
It's him.
Flint?
What he wants, what he needs, what he fears... the depths of it... they are profound and dark.
I serve the crew best by tempering him, steering him where he's needed.
I've descended into those depths and connected with him so that I might be able to do so.
But I am acutely aware that I'm not the first to have been there... to have been a partner to him in this way.
And that the ones that have seen those depths before... they never surfaced again.
Maybe their mistake was in trying to do it alone.
Maybe to go to such a place, one needs another to hold the tether and to find a way out.
Maybe.
I know this cannot have been easy for you.
I know this is so far from how you thought things would end.
But I wanted you to know that the end of this may not quite be what you think it is.
How's that?
When Anne receives your letter and returns here with what remains of the cache,
Nassau will be secured, and everyone will know that it is because of Jack Rackham that it occurred.
I'll have spared Nassau... and you think the story of it will be told long after I am gone?
I know it will.
I will make sure of it.
Sounds a lifeless story to me, and one that requires commitments before the fact to ensure its retelling.
When the current story unfolds, I assure you, it's going to get around all on its own.
What does that mean?
I walked into this place today stunned at how quickly that man downstairs had completed his conquest, how thoroughly he had seemed to win just about everyone I know over to his side.
The truth of the matter is there's been no conquest.
It's only the appearance of one.
For conquest is an either/or proposition.
Either you have it or you do not.
It would appear that without that cache, he most certainly does not.
Jack, what did you do?
I sent word to Anne to take the cache and disappear.
No.
The governor saw your letter to her.
You don't think I can convey a thought to Anne comprehensible only to her?
A thought as simple as "run"?
A letter that said everything the governor wished it to say in exactly the way he'd want to say it would not sound like anything I'd ever say.
A thought here or two between the lines...
I assure you, she understood.
So I have begun the duel between myself and our Lord Governor.
The rules are simple.
I will deny him the cache.
No matter what sort of inducements he offers or pain he inflicts,
I will deny him the cache, and so I will deny him the victory.
And in doing so, I will ensure that whatever Nassau is come Christmas,
English will be not it.
Do not do this.
It's done.
So, one of two outcomes will result.
Rogers will understand his defeat to be ultimately inevitable and leave this place, in which case I'll have it back.
Or he'll stubbornly refuse and eventually Spain will raze this place to the ground.
The English flag will burn, and a second pirate republic will be born from the ashes of the first.
Only this time, every man who calls it home will know it came about because of me.
I worry... that we have made a terrible mistake.
I see what you see in them...
Silver and Flint.
But their relationship is so volatile and we have put our lives in their hands.
Those men rose to their stations because they are peerless when it comes to shaping the world to their will, in creating a narrative and wielding it to compel men's hearts and minds.
But the most compelling story requires a villain at its center.
And if either Captain Flint or Mr. Silver sees the other as a villain... or worse... us as that... then all is lost.
They are of great value to us, but they must be managed by us to avoid that outcome.
How?
I wish... you and I had not been so separate all those years.
I wish I could have found a way to be a better father to you.
But over time, I was determined to leave you something behind, to give you the one thing that no one could ever take away... and that would make you strong enough to understand their world, interact with their world... wage war on their world.
But if their identity lies in their stories,
I wanted you to know them so that when we are ready to call them enemies, you would be ready for it.
The villain makes the story.
So to manage our current partners, we must ensure that we all agree at all times who our common villain is.
The fugitive's name is Anne Bonny.
She's going for a capture of £500.
... several miles away on the road out of town.
Earlier today, before we knew Rackham was still on the island, you seemed confident that we could locate him and his friend in time.
You said it was possible because they didn't know that we were looking for them.
Why do I get the feeling, now that they do know, now that they've made it their personal crusade to see this regime fail, that your estimate will be far less optimistic?
The militia will help.
It will keep the pressure on, and perhaps we'll get lucky.
But if we don't, then you may have to be prepared...
Oh, I'm prepared to do anything.
Anne Bonny must be found.
The cache must be found.
Right now, that is all that matters.
And that said, the goodwill that we have engendered among the people of Nassau is not without limits.
The longer this drags out, the riskier it becomes, because if I find that money only to lose the street...
You will not.
If you have me, then you have the street.
I am all the reassurance they need.
Yes, Jack and Anne were my partners, my friends.
More.
But now they have made themselves something else to me.
I have sacrificed too much to build something here.
I will not let them take it away.
All he ever did was offer me his friendship.
I cast him aside once, spent years regretting it.
And now here we are again.
Tell me I didn't do it for nothing.
Well, I won't lie to you.
It would have helped having the fleet.
We have assets, we have allies.
The question is what we make of them.
I may be able to help in that regard.
Something to add to our pool of assets.
Before Ocracoke, we came upon a prize... a Spanish prize ferrying a significant trove of intelligence.
Most of it was destroyed by the time we found it, but among the remains was one piece of information, something everyone else was quick to dismiss as it held no value to them in that moment.
Information about what?
Money... separated from the Urca gold within the fort and rendered into a new form... a cache of gems for which Spain is holding the new governor accountable.
A cache which, if used creatively, could be the key to defeating British forces in Nassau.
The only question is, can we find it before he does?
About six months ago...
I was approached by the intelligence department of the Casa de Contratación.
They offered me a significant amount of money.
I said yes.
The department's spies had learned of an attempt to walk away with their money without them knowing of it.
If you do not return the entirety of the hidden cache, know that Nassau will likely burn for it.
With everything I've lost in recent days,
I can't afford to lose the name, too.
We walk into the tavern, we sign our names, and then not only are we square with the law our money is, too.
The wound should be far further along towards quietening itself.
If the decay progresses,
I'll have to remove more of your leg.
What does a colonial power do when they see a sitting governor deposed by an alliance of pirates and slaves bring down Nassau?
Maybe bring it all down.
What happens now?
Now we go find Charles Vane.
Where is he?
When you said that you'd be staying behind to solidify our new compact,
I assumed that meant something.
For you to be seen as uninterested in what is happening for my father now, that is not going to help convince anyone here that you are serious about desiring their friendship.
It'll pass.
It's just a fever from the wound.
I'm fine.
Swing it down on deck!
Fucking idiot!
Hey!
What's going on here?
His lashing came undone.
I fucking showed it to him 10 minutes ago.
Someone could have been killed.
Then you showed him incorrectly.
It's a fucking lashing.
I know how to tie it.
If he tied it wrong, then you instructed him wrong.
You listen to me.
We persuaded them that they need us.
We most certainly need them.
Do you understand what I'm saying?
Don't imagine that will be the last of those.
Neither do I.
So how exactly do you see this working?
They have their orders.
As long as we hold our end of the bargain, they'll hold.
Yeah, that wasn't what I meant.
I understood a war meant to antagonize England to frighten them, to prevent them from moving against Nassau.
But that isn't what we're talking about anymore, is it?
Now you're talking about a war meant to be won.
You convinced them.
Convinced Scott, his wife, their people, our people, even Silver.
But not you.
Everyone's wrong but you.
Maybe.
Captain!
Masts!
Captain.
Ocracoke Island.
Teach is there.
A few hours' time, assuming he's there,
I'm going to begin a discussion in which I'm going to ask him for something that he can't possibly give.
And the success or failure of this war will depend upon the outcome.
In a few hours' time, there's a good chance you're going to look awfully smart.
You look good.
- As handsome as ever.
- You always were a gifted liar.
When you were still pirating,
I was the woman who was Blackbeard's woman.
Put my services in great demand all men wanting what notorious men already had.
And then you leave and my business fades.
It's always the little people who get hurt the worst when the market turns.
So when are you going to tell me?
- Tell you what?
- What he's doing here.
Charles?
I remember when he had forced you from Nassau.
I remember how angry you were, how disappointed.
And I remember you telling me that you'd never make the same mistake again, that you had learned the hard way that only God made sons.
Things are different now.
Different how?
Doesn't need to last long.
A little Spanish shrapnel.
It went in here when I was not much older than him.
Once in a while it migrates, ticks closer to reaching its terminus and striking its chime.
Grim little timepiece whose ticking has grown louder to my ears of late.
Charles doesn't know, does he?
Captain!
Jesus.
Welcome to Ocracoke.
At first I was tempted, but in the end it felt wrong to betray the governor that way.
And it felt dangerous... so I declined.
Then how did this happen?
How does an honest chambermaid end up in the employ of the Spanish empire?
A few days after I declined their offer...
I came home late from the governor's service.
It wasn't unusual for me to return home to find my children long since fast asleep.
That night, my children were not alone.
The man who had approached me.
Grandal... was there... waiting.
In his left hand, a knife.
In his right, a purse.
He said my children would receive something from him that night.
He asked me to choose which.
These are the people whom I am beholden to.
This is what they are capable of doing.
I cannot imagine what they will do if the cache is not returned whole.
Ship's manifest, sir.
The entirety of the gold from the fort is now stowed and ready for transport to Havana.
We should be under way within the hour.
Put it in my office, please.
I just left Miss Hudson.
I had the instinct once or twice, the way she'd been watching me of late.
I dismissed it, just assumed it related to some concern over my relationship with you and its becoming inappropriate.
What did she say?
Did she report that we're earnestly attempting to find and return the missing money?
It's not about the money for them, not anymore.
When the gold from the Urca was stolen, it was bad enough.
Now they hear the gold is being converted into something more easily hidden from them, more easily smuggled away.
That isn't theft.
It's an insult.
And insults to empires require answers.
So it's personal, then?
A binary question of my trustworthiness.
Either I return the full cache and prove it or I fail, and in trying to excuse the shortfall, only aggravate their existing suspicion that I am part of the pirate problem, not its solution.
And the dread fleet in Havana sets sail the very next day to raze all of Nassau to the ground.
Then we'll fight them, defend the island.
The odds would be dire, but we are not without resources.
No, not "we."
I mean, someone might fight them, but it won't be you and I.
If the result of my endeavor here is a Spanish attack against British forces, an act that threatens to drag the empire into a war,
I would be recalled to London and likely debtors' prison and your capital sentence would be reinstated.
Now, I believe Nassau's best chance at survival is with me guiding it.
But if we cannot find Jack Rackham and Anne Bonny, if we can't find the cache in their possession, whatever happens to Nassau, you and I are likely finished.
Pardon me, gentlemen, if you don't mind me asking, where is this wagon headed?
To the fort.
To do what, exactly?
To fix it.
I see.
Just you two on the job, is it?
A whole gang of us up there.
Governor wants it shipshape by the end of the month.
Suppose that fort's not going to rebuild itself.
No, I suppose it won't.
Hold still.
There.
Well?
What do you think?
You mean aside from the tit curtains?
It's called a cravat.
You want to fit in with them, right?
This is what they wear.
They who?
Respectable men.
- Place of birth?
- Bristol.
- Occupation?
- Ship's carpenter.
Ship served?
I used to serve the Buccaneer.
Sign here.
Move on.
Next?
What the fuck are you doing here?
It's a cravat.
It's what respectable men wear.
Never mind what it is.
You're supposed to be long gone by now.
Why'd you come back?
Where we're going, it seemed better to have one of these than not.
I thought as an added prize,
I'd at least be able to see it for myself, the new governor up to his ears in the very same bullshit in which I've been drowning for the past few months.
And what do I find?
The streets are swept, industry is in fashion, you're dressed like a Turkish whore, and all because a man arrived, stood on the beach, and said please.
You're angry.
I'm confounded.
He offers them less in wages than I offered, demands more from them in labor, restricts more from them in license, and yet despite all of that,
he's won them.
How can that be?
I know it may be hard to believe given my... appearance at the moment, but the experience of it?
It ain't half bad, Jack.
Next.
Next man, please.
- Your legal name?
- John Rackham.
What?
The Lord Governor would like a word with you.
Watch him, please.
- I'll go fetch Fremah to tend to him.
- I said no.
I know you did.
I don't want help.
It'll pass.
I'll just find a place to weather it for the night.
I understand that you do not want anyone to see you this way.
What I don't understand is why you choose to suffer in the first place.
You must have access to better medicines than that.
We've got access to better medicines than that.
This has nothing to do with medicine.
- It has something to do with medicine...
- I cannot look weak.
I cannot feel weak.
I cannot be weak.
Not in front of my men.
Not in front of your men.
Not at all.
For some time now, I have been holding my entire world together with both hands, keeping my men in line, seeing to their needs,
and the only way that endures is if I look the part.
And I cannot look the part while being poked and prodded or while drooling through an opium haze saying who the fuck knows what.
So I will endure this the way I have been enduring it.
No one prepared you for this, did they?
For as long as I can remember,
I have been prepared for the day I would take my mother's place.
To know that from that day forth,
I would forever be the one who tends as opposed to the one who is tended to.
You're frustrated.
You're angry.
You're tired.
Perhaps no one else knows why.
I believe that not even you know why.
But I know why.
The crown is always a burden... but it cannot be borne if you cannot stand.
Nearly dismasted in a storm... a storm you chased after.
Nearly starved to death in the doldrums.
Nearly executed by them.
Either you are unkillable, friend, or way overdue.
One way or another, I am here, and there is much to discuss about all our futures.
What kind of future do you propose that to be?
I intend to gather forces and move to reclaim Nassau.
The conquest is always weakest when the conqueror allows himself to believe that it is done.
For Nassau, that point is now.
Now, England may hold the island, but it still needs supplies brought in.
It is still dependent upon trade.
We will make that impossible for him.
We will harass his ships.
We will plunder his supplies.
We will force him to bleed capital and support and the goodwill of the men surrounding him until he is weak enough to challenge directly.
Until we can bring the fleet to bear and retake the bay.
You know, when I called Nassau home, most of the men on this beach weren't even men.
I sailed with Ben Hornigold.
I sailed with Sam Bellamy.
I sailed with Henry Avery.
Feuded with them, stole from them, questioned their motives, but we all knew what we were.
Then a man arrives.
Who would explain to us that what we've been doing was wrong all those years, what Nassau ought to be, what he could make it if we would all just follow his lead.
And here you are again to do the same.
You let it go well before its time.
It was past its time.
That you cannot see this... only makes it clearer to me that you never even knew it in the first place.
This fleet is all that remains of it, and as long as it's mine, Nassau shall remain in its past.
It isn't yours.
It never was.
Those ships, their commanders and crews, they were pledged to my command, not yours.
Oaths were taken, and I have come to see them honored.
Do you honestly believe that I would just step aside and let you make that claim?
I honestly don't give a shit what you would or would not do.
The decision isn't yours.
It's his.
I've come to resume our compact, the one we swore upon our lives to uphold.
If you stand up and acknowledge it, this fleet will follow us.
I'm certain of it.
- You weren't there.
- No, I wasn't.
But had I been there, there would be no question about any of this.
Had I been there, we would have mounted the defense that we had agreed to mount.
Had you been there, you would have seen their faces, the ones who laid their arms down and turned their backs on us.
The ones who took our money for months and were happy to try and deliver my head to our enemies for a little more of it.
Nassau is dead.
It doesn't deserve anything else from me or the men on this beach.
We are finally free from it, and I see no reason to change that.
If you wish to leave this place, I'll allow it, although somehow I don't think you have any intention of leaving.
No, I don't.
And I think you know that I would never allow you to call a vote to settle the matter of who this fleet follows and risk you depleting my force by luring away some misguided minority.
No, I don't imagine you would.
So we have one fleet and two men claiming it.
There is only one way I know of to resolve that.
Pistols, then swords.
Captain Rackham.
It's a pleasure to finally meet you.
Give us the room, please.
Drink?
Thank you.
I apologize for the strangeness of this meeting.
I know you and I don't know each other.
I know you... some.
I read your book.
Did you?
Well, most of it.
I confess, I may not quite have soldiered through to the end.
But, you know, I got the gist of it.
If you don't mind my asking, what did you take to be its gist?
Wealthy son of a wealthy man takes to the sea to prove something to the parents, presumably.
Seeks adventure, finds the limits of his own capacity.
Loses everything in the process and then stumbles upon a hell of a story in the process.
Please understand, I'm quite particular about my library, but people seem to have liked it fine, and it seems to have done wonders for you.
Congratulations on all that.
Thank you.
All of that notwithstanding... you and I share an experience in this place.
And as such, I'm hopeful that you'll understand why it is I brought you here today and what it is I'm about to ask of you.
What's that?
I know you removed a significant amount of gold from the fort.
I know it is in your possession, and I need you to give it up... or we're all dead.
You can't win.
I hear you spent weeks becalmed, deprived of food and water.
At your best, it would have been a dogfight, but diminished.
I'm not that diminished.
He's been off the account for years.
He'll be more vulnerable than he remembers himself being.
He's not that vulnerable.
And for what?
You subject yourself to certain death for an island full of weaklings and ingrates?
Those men will go where they are led.
Rogers captured their minds before you could, but let's not pretend that they can't be won again.
And let's not pretend that either of us believes for a moment that I'm doing this for their sakes.
I gave you my word.
Shook your hand.
Pledged to defend the island with you.
But my pledge to him began a long time before I ever knew your name.
- What I owe him...
- I don't care.
I don't care that you shook my hand.
I don't care what you feel you owe him.
This is too important to be clouded by any of that.
They took my home.
I can't walk away from that.
Can you?
Forget me, forget Teach, forget loyalty, compacts, honor, debts, all of it.
The only question that matters is this.
Who are you?
Spain knows about the exchanges?
They do, and they are displeased.
How do you know they know?
So what does that look like?
Return it all or it's the Rosario raid all over again?
Something like that.
I understand why you did it.
I know what it feels like to lose everything and feel powerless to do anything about it.
The temptation to keep something to show for it all, I understand it.
But it does not change the reality we face.
That you face.
For I assure you, if Spain invades over this, yours will be the first face they see.
I heard Henry Avery's name when I was a boy, heard the way people spoke it, grown men in... awe of it.
I came to this place so determined to do the same.
That's not going to happen the way I thought it was, is it?
It never does.
My advice?
You want some say in how they speak of you?
Write a book.
Right now, what do you want to do?
Do you have a pen?
He's agreed to cooperate.
One man goes into the interior to deliver this, instructions written in his hand to his partner to return to Nassau and surrender the cache.
He said she may be wary, asked there be only one messenger to deliver the letter.
Give this to Lieutenant Hersey.
Have him prepare to depart for the interior.
I'll pass him details momentarily.
He should be made aware Anne will not be taken lightly.
Well, neither will Lieutenant Hersey.
I understand Jack was arrested today.
I would like to know why.
What happens if he loses?
If he loses, he dies.
I meant what happens to us?
I don't know.
Probably given a chance to join the fleet, fold in, and go back on the account.
When your men entreated me to join your crew, they said your captain was a man worth following.
A strong man, a wise man, they said.
But right now I can't tell which side of this contest you'd prefer to see prevail.
Can you help me make sense of that?

This is a matter of honor to be settled once and for good in the here and now.
The parties have agreed to combat and have accepted common practice.
The parties have further agreed there will be no quarter asked... nor given.
Cock your pistols!
From this moment, there's to be no movement until a count of three.
One... two... three!
Take him.
And get the fuck off my beach.
If you won't take the opium, at least take this to bite down on.
Just do it.
The burden I wasn't prepared for... it isn't the men.
It's him.
Flint?
What he wants... what he needs, what he fears... the depths of it... they are profound and dark.
I serve the crew best by tempering him, steering him where he's needed.
I've descended into those depths and connected with him so that I might be able to do so.
But I am acutely aware that I'm not the first to have been there... to have been a partner to him in this way.
And that the ones that have seen those depths before... they never surfaced again.
Maybe their mistake was in trying to do it alone.
Maybe to go to such a place, one needs another
to hold the tether and to find a way out.
Maybe.
I know this cannot have been easy for you.
I know this is so far from how you thought things would end.
But I wanted you to know that the end of this may not quite be what you think it is.
How's that?
When Anne receives your letter and returns here with what remains of the cache,
Nassau will be secured, and everyone will know that it is because of Jack Rackham that it occurred.
I'll have spared Nassau... and you think the story of it will be told long after I am gone?
I know it will.
I will make sure of it.
Sounds a lifeless story to me, and one that requires commitments before the fact to ensure its retelling.
When the current story unfolds, I assure you, it's going to get around all on its own.
What does that mean?
I walked into this place today stunned at how quickly that man downstairs had completed his conquest, how thoroughly he had seemed to win just about everyone I know over to his side.
The truth of the matter is there's been no conquest.
It's only the appearance of one.
For conquest is an either/or proposition.
Either you have it or you do not.
It would appear that without that cache, he most certainly does not.
Jack, what did you do?
I sent word to Anne to take the cache... and disappear.
No...
The governor saw your letter to her.
You don't think I can convey a thought to Anne comprehensible only to her?
A thought as simple as "run"?
A letter that said everything the governor wished it to say in exactly the way he'd want to say it would not sound like anything I'd ever say.
A thought here or two between the lines I assure you, she understood.
So I have begun the duel between myself and our Lord Governor.
The rules are simple.
I will deny him the cache.
No matter what sort of inducements he offers or pain he inflicts,
I will deny him the cache, and so I will deny him the victory.
And in doing so, I will ensure that whatever Nassau is come Christmas,
English will be not it.
Do not do this.
It's done.
So, one of two outcomes will result.
Rogers will understand his defeat to be ultimately inevitable and leave this place, in which case I'll have it back.
Or... he'll stubbornly refuse and eventually Spain will raze this place to the ground.
The English flag will burn, and a second pirate Republic will be born from the ashes of the first.
Only this time, every man who calls it home will know it came about because of me.
I worry... that we have made a terrible mistake.
I see what you see in them...
Silver and Flint.
But their relationship is so volatile and we have put our lives in their hands.
Those men... rose to their stations because... they are peerless when it comes to shaping the world to their will, in creating a narrative and... wielding it to compel men's hearts and minds.
But the most compelling story requires a villain at its center.
And if either Captain Flint or Mr. Silver sees the other as a villain or worse... us as that... then all is lost.
They are of great value to us, but they must be managed by us to avoid that outcome.
How?
I wish... you and I had not been so separate all those years.
I wish I could have found a way to be a better father to you.
But over time, I was determined to leave you something behind, to give you the one thing that no one could ever take away... and that would make you strong enough to understand their world,
interact with their world... wage war... on their world.
But if their identity lies in their stories, I wanted you to know them so that when we are ready to call them enemies, you would be ready for it.
The villain makes the story.
So to manage our current partners, we must ensure that we all agree at all times who... our common villain is.
Earlier today, before we knew Rackham was still on the island, you seemed confident that we could locate him and his friend in time.
You said it was possible because they didn't know that we were looking for them.
Why do I get the feeling, now that they do know, now that they've made it their personal crusade to see this regime fail, that your estimate will be far less optimistic?
The militia will help It will keep the pressure on, and perhaps we'll get lucky.
But if we don't,
- then you may have to be prepared...
- Oh, I'm prepared to do anything.
Anne Bonny must be found.
The cache must be found.
Right now, that is all that matters.
And that said, the goodwill that we have engendered among the people of Nassau is not... without limits.
The longer this drags out, the riskier it becomes, because if I find that money only to lose the street...
You will not.
If you have me, then you have the street.
I am all the reassurance they need.
Yes, Jack and Anne were my partners... my friends.
More.
But now they have made themselves something else to me.
I have sacrificed too much to build something here.
I will not let them take it away.
All he ever did was offer me his friendship.
I cast him aside once, spent years regretting it.
And now here we are again.
Tell me I didn't do it for nothing.
Well, I won't lie to you.
It would have helped having the fleet.
We have assets, we have allies.
The question is what we make of them.
I may be able to help in that regard.
Something to add to our pool of assets.
Before Ocracoke, we came upon a prize a Spanish prize.
Ferrying a significant trove of intelligence.
Most of it was destroyed by the time we found it, but... among the remains was one piece of information, something everyone else was quick to dismiss as it held no value to them in that moment.
- Information about what?
- Money.
Separated from the Urca gold within the fort and rendered into a new form... a cache of gems for which Spain is holding the new governor accountable.
A cache which, if used creatively, could be the key to defeating British forces in Nassau.
The only question is, can we find it before he does?
About six months ago,
I was approached by the intelligence department of the Casa de Contratación.
They offered me a significant amount of money.
I said yes.
The department's spies had learned of an attempt to walk away with their money without them knowing of it.
If you do not return the entirety of the hidden cache, know that Nassau will likely burn for it.
With everything I've lost in recent days,
I can't afford to lose the name, too.
We walk into the tavern, we sign our names, and then not only are we square with the law, our money is, too.
The wound should be far further along towards quietening itself.
If the decay progresses,
I'll have to remove more of your leg.
What does a colonial power do when they see a sitting governor deposed by an alliance of pirates and slaves bring down Nassau?
Maybe bring it all down.
What happens now?
Now we go find Charles Vane.
♪
Where is he?
When you said that you'd be staying behind to solidify our new compact,
I assumed that meant something.
For you to be seen as uninterested in what is happening for my father now, that is not going to help convince anyone here that you are serious about desiring their friendship.
It'll pass.
It's just a fever from the wound.
I'm fine.
Christ!
I'm all right!
Swing it down on deck!
Fucking idiot!
Listen, if you can't tie a rope, you shouldn't be on this ship!
Get astern.
Calm down!
Hey!
What's going on here?
His lashing came undone.
I fucking showed it to him 10 minutes ago.
Someone could have been killed.
Then you showed him incorrectly.
It's a fucking lashing.
I know how to tie it.
If he tied it wrong, then you instructed him wrong.
You listen to me.
We persuaded them that they need us.
We most certainly need them.
Do you understand what I'm saying?
Don't imagine that will be the last of those.
Neither do I.
So how exactly do you see this working?
They have their orders.
As long as we hold our end of the bargain, they'll hold.
Yeah, that wasn't what I meant.
I understood a war meant to antagonize England- to frighten them, to prevent them from moving against Nassau.
But that isn't what we're talking about anymore, is it?
Now you're talking about a war meant to be won.
You convinced them.
Convinced Scott, his wife, their people, our people, even Silver.
But not you.
Everyone's wrong but you.
Maybe.
Captain!
Masts!
Captain.
Ocracoke Island.
Teach is there.
A few hours' time, assuming he's there,
I'm going to begin a discussión in which I'm going to ask him for something that he can't possibly give.
And the success or failure of this war will depend upon the outcome.
In a few hours' time, there's a good chance you're going to look awfully smart.
What are you doing?
Bring him down!
You look good.
As handsome as ever.
You always were a gifted liar.
When you were still pirating,
I was the woman who was Blackbeard's woman.
Put my services in great demand- all men wanting what notorious men already had.
And then you leave and my business fades.
It's always the little people who get hurt the worst when the market turns.
So when are you going to tell me?
Tell you what?
What he's doing here.
Charles?
I remember when he had forced you from Nassau.
I remember how angry you were, how disappointed.
And I remember you telling me that you'd never make the same mistake again, that you had learned the hard way that only God made sons.
Things are different now.
Different how?
Doesn't need to last long.
A little Spanish shrapnel.
It went in here when I was not much older than him.
Once in a while it migrates, ticks closer to reaching its terminus and striking its chime.
Grim little timepiece whose ticking has grown louder to my ears of late.
Charles doesn't know, does he?
Captain!
Jesus.
Welcome to Ocracoke.
At first I was tempted, but in the end it felt wrong to betray the governor that way.
And it felt dangerous... so I declined.
Then how did this happen?
How does an honest chambermaid end up in the employ of the Spanish empire?
A few days after I declined their offer...
I came home late from the governor's service.
It wasn't unusual for me to return home to find my children long since fast asleep.
That night, my children were not alone.
The man who had approached me-
Grandal- was there... waiting.
In his left hand, a knife.
In his right, a purse.
He said my children would receive something from him that night.
He asked me to choose which.
These are the people whom I am beholden to.
This is what they are capable of doing.
I cannot imagine what they will do if the cache is not returned whole.
Ship's manifest, sir.
The entirety of the gold from the fort is now stowed and ready for transport to Havana.
We should be under way within the hour.
Put it in my office, please.
I just left Miss Hudson.
I had the instinct once or twice, the way she'd been watching me of late.
I dismissed it, just assumed it related to some concern over my relationship with you and its becoming inappropriate.
What did she say?
Did she report that we're earnestly attempting to find and return the missing money?
It's not about the money for them, not anymore.
When the gold from the Urca was stolen, it was bad enough.
Now they hear the gold is being converted into something more easily hidden from them, more easily smuggled away.
That isn't theft.
It's an insult.
And insults to empires require answers.
So it's personal, then?
A binary question of my trustworthiness.
Either I return the full cache and prove it or I fail, and in trying to excuse the shortfall, only aggravate their existing suspición that I am part of the pirate problem, not its solution.
And the dread fleet in Havana sets sail the very next day to raze all of Nassau to the ground.
Then we'll fight them, defend the island.
The odds would be dire, but we are not without resources.
No, not "we."
I mean, someone might fight them, but it won't be you and I.
If the result of my endeavor here is a Spanish attack against British forces, an act that threatens to drag the empire into a war,
I would be recalled to London and likely debtors' prison and your capital sentence would be reinstated.
Now, I believe Nassau's best chance at survival is with me guiding it.
But if we cannot find Jack Rackham and Anne Bonny, if we can't find the cache in their possessión, whatever happens to Nassau, you and I are likely finished.
Pardon me, gentlemen, if you don't mind me asking, where is this wagon headed?
To the fort.
To do what, exactly?
To fix it.
I see.
Just you two on the job, is it?
A whole gang of us up there.
Governor wants it shipshape by the end of the month.
Suppose that fort's not going to rebuild itself.
No, I suppose it won't.
Hold still.
There.
Well?
What do you think?
You mean aside from the tit curtains?
It's called a cravat.
You want to fit in with them, right?
This is what they wear.
"They" who?
Respectable men.
All right, yeah.
Place of birth?
Bristol.
Occupation?
Ship's carpenter.
Ship served?
I used to serve the Buccaneer.
Sign here.
Move on.
Next?
What the fuck are you doing here?
It's a cravat.
It's what respectable men wear.
It's- never mind what it is.
You're supposed to be long gone by now.
Why'd you come back?
Where we're going, it seemed better to have one of these than not.
I thought as an added prize,
I'd at least be able to see it for myself, the new governor up to his ears in the very same bullshit in which I've been drowning for the past few months.
And what do I find?
The streets are swept, industry is in fashion, you're dressed like a Turkish whore, and all because a man arrived, stood on the beach, and said please.
You're angry.
I'm confounded.
He offers them less in wages than I offered, demands more from them in labor, restricts more from them in license, and yet despite all of that, he's won them.
How can that be?
I know it may be hard to believe given my appearance at the moment, but the experience of it?
It ain't half bad, Jack.
Next.
Next man, please.
Your legal name?
John Rackham.
What?
The Lord Governor would like a word with you.
Watch him, please.
I'll go fetch Fremah to tend to him.
I said no.
I know you did.
I don't want help.
It'll pass.
I'll just find a place to weather it for the night.
I understand that you do not want anyone to see you this way.
What I don't understand is why you choose to suffer in the first place.
You must have access to better medicines than that.
We've got access to better medicines than that.
This has nothing to do with medicine.
It has something to do with medicine-
I cannot look weak.
I cannot feel weak.
I cannot be weak.
Not in front of my men.
Not in front of your men.
Not at all.
For some time now, I have been holding my entire world together with both hands, keeping my men in line, seeing to their needs, and the only way that endures is if I look the part.
And I cannot look the part while being poked and prodded or while drooling through an opium haze saying who the fuck knows what.
So I will endure this the way I have been enduring it.
No one prepared you for this, did they?
For as long as I can remember,
I have been prepared for the day
I would take my mother's place.
To know that from that day forth,
I would forever be the one who tends as opposed to the one who is tended to.
You're frustrated.
You're angry.
You're tired.
Perhaps no one else knows why.
I believe that not even you know why.
But I know why.
The crown is always a burden... but it cannot be borne if you cannot stand.
Nearly dismasted in a storm- a storm you chased after.
Nearly starved to death in the doldrums.
Nearly executed by them.
Either you are unkillable, friend, or way overdue.
One way or another, I am here, and there is much to discuss about all our futures.
What kind of future do you propose that to be?
I intend to gather forces and move to reclaim Nassau.
The conquest is always weakest when the conqueror allows himself to believe that it is done.
For Nassau, that point is now.
Now, England may hold the island, but it still needs supplies brought in.
It is still dependent upon trade.
We will make that impossible for him.
We will harass his ships.
We will plunder his supplies.
We will force him to bleed capital and support and the goodwill of the men surrounding him until he is weak enough to challenge directly.
Until we can bring the fleet to bear and retake the bay.
You know, when I called Nassau home, most of the men on this beach weren't even men.
I sailed with Ben Hornigold.
I sailed with Sam Bellamy.
I sailed with Henry Avery.
Feuded with them, stole from them, questioned their motives, but we all knew what we were.
Then a man arrives who would explain to us that what we've been doing was wrong all those years, what Nassau ought to be, what he could make it if we would all just follow his lead.
And here you are again to do the same.
You let it go well before its time.
It was past its time.
That you cannot see this only makes it clearer to me that you never even knew it in the first place.
This fleet is all that remains of it, and as long as it's mine, Nassau shall remain in its past.
It isn't yours.
It never was.
Those ships, their commanders and crews, they were pledged to my command, not yours.
Oaths were taken, and I have come to see them honored.
Do you honestly believe that I would just step aside and let you make that claim?
I honestly don't give a shit what you would or would not do.
The decisión isn't yours.
It's his.
I've come to resume our compact, the one we swore upon our lives to uphold.
If you stand up and acknowledge it, this fleet will follow us.
I'm certain of it.
You weren't there.
No, I wasn't.
But had I been there, there would be no question about any of this.
Had I been there, we would have mounted the defense that we had agreed to mount.
Had you been there, you would have seen their faces, the ones who laid their arms down and turned their backs on us.
The ones who took our money for months and were happy to try and deliver my head to our enemies for a little more of it.
Nassau is dead.
It doesn't deserve anything else from me or the men on this beach.
We are finally free from it, and I see no reason to change that.
If you wish to leave this place, I'll allow it, although somehow I don't think you have any intention of leaving.
No, I don't.
And I think you know that I would never allow you to call a vote to settle the matter of who this fleet follows and risk you depleting my force by luring away some misguided minority.
No, I don't imagine you would.
So we have one fleet and two men claiming it.
There is only one way I know of to resolve that.
Pistols, then swords.
Captain Rackham.
It's a pleasure to finally meet you.
Give us the room, please.
Drink?
Thank you.
I apologize for the strangeness of this meeting.
I know you and I don't know each other.
I know you... some.
I read your book.
Did you?
Well, most of it.
I confess, I may not quite have soldiered through to the end.
But, you know, I got the gist of it.
If you don't mind my asking, what did you take to be its gist?
Wealthy son of a wealthy man takes to the sea to prove something to the parents, presumably.
Seeks adventure, finds the limits of his own capacity.
Loses everything in the process and then stumbles upon a hell of a story in the process.
Please understand, I'm quite particular about my library, but people seem to have liked it fine, and it seems to have done wonders for you.
So congratulations on all that.
Thank you.
All of that notwithstanding... you and I share an experience in this place.
And as such, I'm hopeful that you'll understand why it is I brought you here today and what it is I'm about to ask of you.
What's that?
I know you removed a significant amount of gold from the fort.
I know it is in your possessión, and I need you to give it up... or we're all dead.
You can't win.
I hear you spent weeks becalmed, deprived of food and water.
At your best, it would have been a dogfight, but diminished...
I'm not that diminished.
He's been off the account for years.
He'll be more vulnerable than he remembers himself being.
He's not that vulnerable.
And for what?
You subject yourself to certain death for an island full of weaklings and ingrates?
Those men will go where they are led.
Rogers captured their minds before you could, but let's not pretend that they can't be won again.
And let's not pretend that either of us believes for a moment that I'm doing this for their sakes.
I gave you my word.
Shook your hand.
Pledged to defend the island with you.
But my pledge to him began a long time before I ever knew your name.
What I owe him- I don't care.
I don't care that you shook my hand.
I don't care what you feel you owe him.
This is too important to be clouded by any of that.
They took my home.
I can't walk away from that.
Can you?
Forget me, forget Teach, forget loyalty, compacts, honor, debts, all of it.
The only question that matters is this.
Who are you?
Spain knows about the exchanges?
They do, and they are displeased.
How do you know they know?
So what does that look like?
Return it all or it's the Rosario raid all over again?
Something like that.
I understand why you did it.
I know what it feels like to lose everything and feel powerless to do anything about it.
The temptation to keep something to show for it all,
I understand it.
But it does not change the reality we face.
That you face.
For I assure you, if Spain invades over this, yours will be the first face they see.
I heard Henry Avery's name when I was a boy, heard the way people spoke it - grown men in awe of it.
I came to this place so determined to do the same.
That's not going to happen the way I thought it was, is it?
It never does.
My advice?
You want some say in how they speak of you?
Write a book.
Right now, what do you want to do?
Do you have a pen?
He's agreed to cooperate.
One man goes into the interior to deliver this, instructions written in his hand to his partner to return to Nassau and surrender the cache.
He said she may be wary, asked there be only one messenger to deliver the letter.
Give this to Lieutenant Hersey.
Have him prepare to depart for the interior.
I'll pass him details momentarily.
He should be made aware Anne will not be taken lightly.
Well, neither will Lieutenant Hersey.
I understand Jack was arrested today.
I would like to know why.
What happens if he loses?
If he loses, he dies.
I meant what happens to us?
I don't know.
Probably given a chance to join the fleet, fold in, and go back on the account.
When your men entreated me to join your crew, they said your captain was a man worth following.
A strong man, a wise man, they said.
But right now I can't tell which side of this contest you'd prefer to see prevail.
Can you help me make sense of that?
A few days ago I could make sense of all of it.
He was going to die and we were going to be free, from the account, from him...
With all the shit he's done, the things he's gotten away with, that would have been fair.
That would have been right.
I think part of the reason
I've been able to stand by his side is that I wanted to make sure I've got a good view of the moment the world finally catches up to him... and this story starts to make sense again.
This is a matter of honor to be settled once and for good in the here and now.
The parties have agreed to combat and have accepted common practice.
The parties have further agreed there will be no quarter asked nor given.
Cock your pistols!
From this moment, there's to be no movement until a count of three.
One... two... three!
Take him.
And get the fuck off my beach.
If you won't take the opium, at least take this to bite down on.
Just do it.
â™ª
The burden I wasn't prepared for it isn't the men.
It's him.
Flint?
What he wants, what he needs, what he fears... the depths of it... they are profound and dark.
I serve the crew best by tempering him, steering him where he's needed.
I've descended into those depths and connected with him so that I might be able to do so.
But I am acutely aware that I'm not the first to have been there... to have been a partner to him in this way.
And that the ones that have seen those depths before... they never surfaced again.
Maybe their mistake was in trying to do it alone.
Maybe to go to such a place, one needs another to hold the tether and to find a way out.
Maybe.
I know this cannot have been easy for you.
I know this is so far from how you thought things would end.
But I wanted you to know that the end of this may not quite be what you think it is.
How's that?
When Anne receives your letter and returns here with what remains of the cache,
Nassau will be secured, and everyone will know that it is because of Jack Rackham that it occurred.
I'll have spared Nassau... and you think the story of it will be told long after I am gone?
I know it will.
I will make sure of it.
Sounds a lifeless story to me, and one that requires commitments before the fact to ensure its retelling.
When the current story unfolds, I assure you, it's going to get around all on its own.
What does that mean?
I walked into this place today stunned at how quickly that man downstairs had completed his conquest, how thoroughly he had seemed to win just about everyone I know over to his side.
The truth of the matter is there's been no conquest.
It's only the appearance of one.
For conquest is an either/or proposition.
Either you have it or you do not.
It would appear that without that cache, he most certainly does not.
Jack, what did you do?
I sent word to Anne to take the cache and disappear.
No.
The governor saw your letter to her.
You don't think I can convey a thought to Anne comprehensible only to her?
A thought as simple as "run"?
A letter that said everything the governor wished it to say in exactly the way he'd want to say it would not sound like anything I'd ever say.
A thought here or two between the lines-
I assure you, she understood.
So I have begun the duel between myself and our Lord Governor.
The rules are simple.
I will deny him the cache.
No matter what sort of inducements he offers or pain he inflicts,
I will deny him the cache, and so I will deny him the victory.
And in doing so, I will ensure that whatever Nassau is come Christmas,
English will be not it.
Do not do this.
It's done.
So, one of two outcomes will result.
Rogers will understand his defeat to be ultimately inevitable and leave this place, in which case I'll have it back.
Or he'll stubbornly refuse and eventually Spain will raze this place to the ground.
The English flag will burn, and a second pirate republic will be born from the ashes of the first.
Only this time, every man who calls it home will know it came about because of me.
I worry... that we have made a terrible mistake.
I see what you see in them-
Silver and Flint.
But their relationship is so volatile and we have put our lives in their hands.
Those men rose to their stations because they are peerless when it comes to shaping the world to their will, in creating a narrative and wielding it to compel men's hearts and minds.
But the most compelling story requires a villain at its center.
And if either Captain Flint or Mr. Silver sees the other as a villain- or worse... us as that- then all is lost.
They are of great value to us, but they must be managed by us to avoid that outcome.
How?
I wish... you and I had not been so separate all those years.
I wish I could have found a way to be a better father to you.
But over time, I was determined to leave you something behind, to give you the one thing that no one could ever take away... and that would make you strong enough to understand their world, interact with their world... wage war on their world.
But if their identity lies in their stories,
I wanted you to know them so that when we are ready to call them enemies, you would be ready for it.
The villain makes the story.
So to manage our current partners, we must ensure that we all agree at all times who our common villain is.
The fugitive's name is Anne Bonny.
She's going for a capture of Â£500.
...several miles away on the road out of town.
Earlier today, before we knew Rackham was still on the island, you seemed confident that we could locate him and his friend in time.
You said it was possible because they didn't know that we were looking for them.
Why do I get the feeling, now that they do know, now that they've made it their personal crusade to see this regime fail, that your estimate will be far less optimistic?
The militia will help.
It will keep the pressure on, and perhaps we'll get lucky.
But if we don't, then you may have to be prepared-
Oh, I'm prepared to do anything.
Anne Bonny must be found.
The cache must be found.
Right now, that is all that matters.
And that said, the goodwill that we have engendered among the people of Nassau is not without limits.
The longer this drags out, the riskier it becomes, because if I find that money only to lose the street-
You will not.
If you have me, then you have the street.
I am all the reassurance they need.
Yes, Jack and Anne were my partners, my friends.
More.
But now they have made themselves something else to me.
I have sacrificed too much to build something here.
I will not let them take it away.
All he ever did was offer me his friendship.
I cast him aside once, spent years regretting it.
And now here we are again.
Tell me I didn't do it for nothing.
Well, I won't lie to you.
It would have helped having the fleet.
We have assets, we have allies.
The question is what we make of them.
I may be able to help in that regard.
Something to add to our pool of assets.
Before Ocracoke, we came upon a prize- a Spanish prize ferrying a significant trove of intelligence.
Most of it was destroyed by the time we found it, but among the remains was one piece of information, something everyone else was quick to dismiss as it held no value to them in that moment.
Information about what?
Money... separated from the Urca gold within the fort and rendered into a new form- a cache of gems for which Spain is holding the new governor accountable.
A cache which, if used creatively, could be the key to defeating British forces in Nassau.
The only question is, can we find it before he does?
â™ª
- [sighs] - [cell phone rings]
BoJack!
Beautiful day, huh?
Perfect day to go outside, not read the trades or talk to anyone in the industry or watch entertainment television or have a gut feeling about the ratings for your television show last night.
- Princess Carolyn, I'm dying.
- You read the trades.
My heart is in my stomach, my stomach is in my butt, and my butt ran away with the spoon.
That makes sense because your butt is quite a dish.
Can you come over?
I need you.
[sighs]
What the...?
I ordered a few feel-better pizzas to feel better.
It did not work.
Then I sprinkled happy pills on them, and washed it all down with a "Please, God, make my pain go away" vermouth and ice cream float.
- Somehow I feel worse.
- That's a real mystery.
My show was terrible.
Why did I insist on a mockumentary format?
It's already an overused trope now, in 2007.
Hey!
Mockumentary is not a trope, it's a device for storytelling.
And your show is daring and cutting edge.
People just aren't ready.
Yeah.
Yeah, people!
It's not me.
It's the people that are the problem!
Everyone's dumb and I am great.
Why do I always forget that?
That's the spirit.
I'm starting to think this show is the best thing that happened to me.
- Really?
- Yeah.
It made me realize you're the best thing that happened to me, with your sexy cat eyes and your cute little hair curl.
You look like a soft serve strawberry ice cream.
BoJack, we can't.
I'm your agent.
You are so much more than that.
You're my lighthouse, my Garmin.
You're the little plastic table they put in pizza boxes to keep the pizza from getting smushed.
You're Princess Carolyn.
[both moan]
Don't you break my heart, BoJack Horseman.
- What?
- What?
Nothing.
- Did you just say something to me?
- No, I was just being wistful, I guess.
Well, can you be wistful a little quieter?
- Not everyone is interested in your wist.
- Okay, BoJack.
- You smell nice.
- Thanks, BoJack.

[Carolyn laughs]
Okay, gotta go.
I'm about to meet my most important client.
- I know you're not really on the phone.
- Bye, Mr. President.
Give my love to your basketball friends.
You too.
Should we get dinner, or are you just thinking drinks?
- I'm not planning on staying long.
- Okay.
I'm glad you wanted to meet, because I am so pumped to tell you all about the exciting projects I'm lining up for you.
That won't be necessary.
Once you get your Oscar nom, we'll have our pick.
That's the key.
You think Halle Berry would've been offered Catwoman if she wasn't an Oscar winner?
We just gotta find you your Catwoman.
I'm not sure if a Catwoman is really the best thing for my career right now.
Right, well, like I said, we are getting lots of offers.
Listen, Princess Carolyn--
Signore Horseman!
Principessa Carolina!
Sandro, how you doing, you handsome devil?
To be honest I am, how you say, sweating bull's nets.
- You mean sweating bullets?
- I don't think so.
Sweating bullets.
How does that make the sense?
How does sweating bull's nets make sense?
I don't want to be caught in bull's nets.
He may try to kiss me.
I prefer kissing cows.
No judgment, just a preference.
I love kissing cows!
Don't tell my wife.
I'm kidding!
She knows.
She's a cow!
And I only kiss her.
[laughs]
Okay, very good.
Haven't you lived in America for 30 years?
Ignore him.
Why are you sweating bullets and/or nets?
Ah.
Because there is a restaurant critic here tonight.
Very interesting.
Critics are the worst.
That's my review of critics.
Two thumbs down!
Four percent fresh!
One star!
You all eat a flat butt!
Did you not know there was a critic here?
You own this place.
I never see you do anything to help run it.
This place runs itself.
Right, Sandro?
Well, my wife and children and therapy man may not agree so much, but if you say so, Signore Horseman.
Even his wife and kids and therapy man agree.
Well, as the Black Guy Pete say, "Tonight's gonna be a good night."
Please.
Enjoy.
I know you're not happy about what happened with the Kelsey project.
I pushed a little too hard to get you the money you deserve.
What can I say?
Sometimes I'm too good of an agent, so deals fall apart.
That's a thing that happens when agents are really good.
- That's not--
- Moving forward!
I know you're not happy with how I handled Ethan Around.
- Or didn't handle it.
- Bygones!
It was because I was busy getting you the Pegasus movie, which I know you did not get, but trust me, you'll see not getting these movies was the best thing that ever happened to you.
Onwards and upwards!
Tally ho!
To the stars!
Okay, you're forcing me to use the cards.
"Princess Carolyn, clear throat, I have been very disappointed--"
Ring!
Hello, Your Highness.
It's a king, I have to take this.
In the bathroom.
[repeating] Oh, fish, oh, fish!
[female] Who's out there?
Are you talking to me?
No.

All right, Pink Lady, think.
- [female] Are you talking to me?
- Are you a pink lady?
[woman] I was a Pink Lady in my high school's production of Grease.
- Were you Rizzo?
- [female] No, Jan.
Then don't waste my time.
Now, let us bow our heads and bray.

Yes, right away!

Okay, cool.
Can you believe it, BoJack?
It's been almost a quarter of a century.
Talking on the phone pretty much every day, sharing our deepest dreams and secrets, being there for each other through all of it, bosom friends,
Anne of Green Gables style.
Let's toast to another 23 years.
What do you say?
- You're fired.
- Uh-
- Oh.
I can't believe this.
You're firing me?
- Me?
- What?
No.
You have no idea, everything I do around here!
- Half the kitchen staff is my family.
- No.
- Honestly, just--
- I detest you!
I hope you rot in the hell!
- We're headed down a road that--
- You washed-up has-been no-good joke!
You are the opposite of an onion, because if I cut you, I am no gonna cry.
Well, now you are fired.
Good luck finding another charming first-generation Italian immigrant with this kind of darling accent, who makes equally delightful malapropisms!
You, sir, have just cut off your nose and thrown Sprite in your face!
I am a classic stereotype that is tough to come by nowadays, because Italians don't emigrate so much to America no more.
Botticelli, Barbarelli, Beetle Bailey!
Modigliani, Masaccio, Marmaduke!
Avanti, all of you!
Andiamo!
[laughs nervously]
So that was weird, huh?
Please stop looking at me.
Too bad about Sandro, huh?
You're the one who's fired, obviously.
Right.
Ryan Murphy is doing a re-imagining of The Life and Times of Harriet Tubman.
But in this version, she's a tub-man, with the comparative strength and agility of a tub!
- PC.
- He's looking for someone to play the Underground Railroad conductor.
Great, but you don't represent me anymore.
Okay, I get it.
I'm fired.
Sheesk.
You're gonna spend a couple days being mad at me, then I'll get you another gig, and you'll be my client again, just like every time.
Can we get past the part where you're mad at me and get to the part where you're stealing General Lee's plutonium to fuel your subterranean steam-punk slave-tram?
"It's best, for both of us, if we end this relationship once and for all."
I'm sorry I screwed up, you don't have to read off the--
"You take me for granted, made decisions that were against my wishes, and worst of all she's got my globes a-warming!"
- How did that get in there?
- What is that?
A punch line to a joke from the roast of January Jones.
- A global warming joke?
- It's an important issue.
Here we go.
"Our relationship no longer has any--"
"January has only gotten hotter and hot--" Nope.
- Were you at the roast of January Jones?
- No, but I wrote some jokes in case someone got sick and they needed a backup.
Do you even know January Jones?
Why would they call you?
I guess I thought that my agent could get me in the mix if Jason Sudeikis--
How did these get out of order?
So in the joke, are the globes your balls?
And they get warm when you see January Jones?
Is that how balls work?
I don't know.
It's a work in progress.
Professional integrity!
"Our relationship no longer has any professional integrity.
So it's gotta end.
Stand to leave."
Shouldn't have read that part.
"When you reflect on this, you'll see it's best for both of us.
Exit restaurant." Goddamn it.
Wow, that was-- I don't know what that was.
Hey!
Where are you going?
- Who gave you this idea?
Spanakopita?
- This has nothing to do with Ana.
Here you go, sir.
- I'll get it!
- You two are b'thumping.
Now you do whatever she says?
- Is that what's happening?
- No.
No, you're not b'thumping or no, you're not doing whatever she says?
- I'm not doing whatever she says.
- So you are b'thumping.
I understand from context what you mean, but there's no way b'thumping is a thing.
I'll get it!
You don't have to do everything your little falafel pocket tells you to.
- You screwed up!
- Once!
In 23 years!
I'll get 'em.
All these years I carried you, when no one wanted to work with you.
I still managed to get you jobs.
And then you would flake, or sabotage them, or get wrapped up in some crisis or emergency or vague sadness.
Everyone told me to dump you-- my bosses, film execs, directors, they all told me you were washed up, a nobody, a has-been,
- a joke, too portly for TV.
- Too portly for TV?
Who said that?
- It doesn't matter.
- It does.
Who said it?
- Luis Guzman.
- Luis Guzman said I'm too portly for TV?
You're right, BoJack.
This is for the best.
I no longer have to lug your talentless, self-centered, self-sabotaging, dead-weight carcass of faded talent around my neck.
- Hey.
- Thank you for firing me.
I'm gonna go pour myself a little celebratory potato juice, because this is the best goddamn thing that's ever happened to me.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
[groans]
Ha, ha!
I'll get it.
You do not talk to me like that and walk away.
Oh, no?
What's happening?
This is so weird.
I'm walking away, even though you told me not to.
Right, I don't work for you anymore.
- Hey!
- Excuse me, Mr. Horseman?
- Not now.
- We have a slight problem in the kitchen.
- Where is everybody?
- That's the problem.
They all quit.
The kitchen's backed up with orders.
No one's getting food.
And the critic is growing very impatient.
Writing that down...
- Just do what you normally do.
- But there's no chef.
Tonight's your lucky night.
You just got promoted.
But I don't want to be a chef.
♪ I want to sing ♪
Kidding.
I'm actually just happy being a waiter.
I'm not my job.
- A lot of people think that--
- You're the chef!
Start cheffing!
Oh.
[giggling] [murmuring]
What?
Fifty teeth?
Get out of here.
Let me see.
-Ahh...
-Would you look at that.
You're thrilled to have me out of your life?
- I was such a burden all those years.
- Can I close my mouth now?
- Know what I think?
- Don't wanna hear it.
You like being there to rescue me.
- I close my mouth, okay?
- Nobody cares!
- Okay--
- Nope, I'm still counting.
You like it when I'm a mess.
Because it makes you feel good about yourself.
Guess what?
I never asked for that.
You ask all the time.
You have never not been asking me to rescue you.
"Princess Carolyn, help me!
I slept with the gaffer's wife and now he's not lighting me properly.
Princess Carolyn, I threw up on Elle Fanning in a bounce house.
Princess Carolyn, why am I such a big stupid asshole?"
Okay, great, more abuse.
Right on schedule.
Oh, that's abuse?
"BoJack, you're such a big, stupid asshole.
BoJack, why were you even in the bounce house, dummy?
BoJack, you wasted my thirties!"
I never said you wasted my thirties.
Didn't have to, you're always saying it.
And I don't like being around you, because I feel bad.
You make me feel bad.
So this isn't about me being a bad agent.
It's about a lot of things.
- Where are you going?
- Away.
- [sighs]
- Hey, listen, man.
I don't wanna get in the middle of this, it's none of my business, but I just have to say I love that sweater.
- Can you give it to me?
- What?
No.
I held my mouth open a really long time.
- What does that have to do--?
- You're not being fair, to me or Princess Katniss.
- Who?
- Your friend.
You've forgotten her already?
Typical BoSchwack.
That's enough out of you.
It's all right, you're gonna get through this.
- You're gonna get through this.
- [female] Are you okay?
Are you okay?
You've been in there a long time.
[female] I left for a while and came back.
Just so you know, this wasn't an easy decision.
- This is the ladies' room!
- [female] What's going on out there?
Are you watching a movie?
I agonized over this.
Ask Ana.
- Oh.
So you did talk about it with Ana.
- Yeah.
I respect her opinion.
[shouts]
Paws not claws!
Paws not claws!
Hey!
Ow!
God, you're strong.
[BoJack groans]
This is exactly the kind of unprofessionalism I'm talking about.
- You want to talk about professionalism?
- Yes, I do.
But not here.
[shivers]
You say you want professionalism?
Bullshit.
You want a mommy you can slide your dick in.
I can want that and also want professionalism.
A sex-mommy who keeps her boundaries, is that too much to ask?
Is there a single woman you've worked with who you haven't tried to groggily thrust yourself into?
Is it any wonder I don't want to be around you?
All you do is tell me I'm a terrible person.
Please, you're such a self-pitying masochist,
I could say ten nice things and one mean thing, you would only hear the one mean thing.
I'd love it if you said ten nice things to me.
- I can say nice things.
- Ready when you are.
Does self-pitying masochist count, or are we starting from scratch?
Okay, one-
- I'm freezing my whiskers off.
- You have a natural charisma.
- You hesitated, that means it's a lie.
Two, you are loved by millions.
That's not a compliment.
So is Kim Jong Un and Teri Hatcher.
I got this.
I got this.
Pre-heat oven?
Where's the pre-heat button?
Excuse me?
Waiter?
Where are my family's double-fudge cheese pies?
I'm not your waiter anymore.
I'm the chef.
- Then who's our waiter?
- Uh, you're the waiter now.
Ta-da!
I can't be a waiter.
I have a very important business meeting tomorrow.
You get someone else to do it.
I'm the chef and whatever I say goes!
Okay.
Who gets these soy balls and onion cubes?
Table eight.
Deliver those soy balls, soldier.
You got it, boss.
Number six.
You know how to make me laugh.
So I'm a clown to you?
Like Joe Pesci in Home Alone?
[laughs] You recognize you're being impossible, right?
- I don't know how you put up with me.
- I didn't put up with you, BoJack.
I liked being with you.
And I don't regret it.
I don't regret the trip to the Bahamas.
Or the bracelet you bought me for my 38th birthday.
Or when my dad died and you came to the funeral with me and held my hand.
I'm doing this for both of us.
You understand?
- Did you ever love me?
At all?
- I don't-
- I'm not--
You know that I don't do the whole love thing.
Either you end up hurting someone or they hurt you.
So, what's the point?
Yeah.
Ugh.
This sucks.
Ow.
I did this to myself.
I do this to myself.
- Why do I do this to myself?
- I don't know.
Maybe if you're good at putting out fires, you just run from fire to fire and don't really think about-- [screams]
Oh, God, I don't wanna be a chef!
I want to be not on fire!
- We gotta put out that fire!
- I hate Mondays!
[groans] I figured out how to pre-heat the oven.
This night has been a disaster.
The good news is I got my kid to prep my important meeting at work.
The bad news is all the customers went home.
They didn't like the screaming and felt like their food was a little too "on fire".
- It's called a char, dumbshits.
- The critic's still here.
Oh, oh, oh!
She still wants her mushroom risotto.
I don't know how to make risotto.
I know how.
What are you doing?
No, go home.
You're right.
What am I doing?
All right.
Good luck.

We're running out of time.

You wanna use olive oil.
- What are you doing?
Let me do this.
You'll burn the place to the ground.
Fine.
This isn't one of those things where you save my ass so I feel obligated to give you your job back.
I know you have no sense of obligation to me.
Ooh, slam.
I'm sorry, I'd rather not get involved.
- Can I get you some more water?
- Mmm.
You look lovely.
It's a great blouse.
Mom, I wanna go home.
This is a very important night for the restaurant.
How are we coming on the sales meeting?
Did you get the big conference room?
Winslow wants the big conference room for his presentation to corporate.
You get back on that phone and you get me that big room.
Okay, Mom.
The secret is stirring continuously.
Right, so that's the secret.
I'm gonna go roll some more soy balls.
- Thanks for your help.
- Sure.
How do you know how to do this?
Mom was a live-in maid for a rich family.
She had a little trouble bending her elbow too much.
Glug, glug.
So unless I wanted us to be on the street, I had to cover for her, a lot.
That rich family loved Italian food and champagne fountains.
And cocaine.
And private jets.
And screaming at each other.
"Who threw my cocaine in the champagne fountain?"
- So standard rich people stuff?
- I guess.
- How come you never told me that?
- I did.
Oh.
It's okay.
I know you never remember anything.
That's not true.
I remember the first time we met.
I went to see Marv.
You were at the desk in front of his office.
I thought you were cute and you said, "It's good to see you again."
- Oh.
So I guess we'd met before.
- That was the third time we met.
The first time was when I was an intern.
I delivered a script to your house.
You were passed out in the yard, covered in tapioca pudding.
I hosed you down, dragged you inside, covered you with a blanket.
- Really?
I don't remember that.
- Shocker.
So you've gone from daughter of a maid to head of your own company.
Well, the company's not doing so hot.
- Don't try to guilt me.
- It's not your fault.
Turns out being an agent and running an agency are two different skills.
It's like asking a really delicious tomato to make you a tomato sandwich.
How's a tomato gonna make you a sandwich?
He's got no arms.
You'll figure it out.
Princess Carolyn always lands on her feet.
But I don't even know why I'm doing it.
Does any of it matter?
Why are you an agent at all if it makes you so miserable?
Because I'm good at it.
I mean, stuff hasn't been hitting lately.
But, usually, I'm really good at it.
Just 'cause you're good at something doesn't mean you have to do it.
I'm good at driving sober, but I don't relish the opportunity.
But what else would I do?
Who else would I be?
I do love you, by the way.
I mean, as much as I'm capable of loving anyone.
Which is never enough.
I'm sorry.
Ta-da!
Well, it is truly... how should I put this?
Wonderful.
So you'll give Elefante a good review?
Oh, no, I can't do that.
I waited over two hours to be served.
The ambience was terrible.
You two were screaming all night.
At one point, a waiter ran through the restaurant on fire.
Unfortunately, you will be receiving my lowest rating:
four hundred and twelve stars, out of a possible a billion.
A billion stars?
- Oh, God, get out.
- [exclaims]
I assure you the animated GIFs with which I describe this encounter shall be scathing.
Mom!
I just touched base with Rooney, re:
Winslow.
He's out, we're in.
The conference room is ours.
Perfect!
This is the meeting where we finally convince the big boys to let us get babies addicted to vaping!
Yes!
Corporation!
[all cheer]
- How about a drink?
- I could drink.
I don't think I can.
I'm heading out.
I got pretty badly burnt earlier and in a lot of pain.
I should probably go to the ER.
Have a great night.
[groans]
Ha, ha!
What's the second time we met?
- A taping of Horsin' Around.
- Which episode?
The one where Olivia put too much detergent in the washing machine.
[BoJack] Nancy Reagan was the guest star.
That woman was the real actor in the family.
[Carolyn] I just started working for Marv.
I went backstage to introduce myself.
And then what happened?
You told me you were too tired pretending to be nice all night,
- and I needed to leave you alone.
- Oh.
I'm a real jerk, huh?
Yeah, but you're honest, straightforward, not fake nice and don't beat around the bush.
Your heart is tender, so you protect it from people, but sometimes you open up a wall and it's incredible.
You're doing the best you can, considering your asshole parents.
You have great taste in art, and that pink spot on your nose is just adorable.
How many nice things was that, about ten?
- Yeah, just about.
- Okay, one more.
You let me help you tonight because you knew I needed it.
You did it for me, which was very sweet.
Thanks.
You're a good friend to me.
- BoJack...
- Yeah?
Are we friends?
Yeah.
I mean, I think we are.
Or I think we can be.
Okay, then as a friend, I'm asking you...
Please don't leave me.
- Princess Carolyn--
- Please.
I can turn this around, I just need more time.
We're in a fragile period, still finding our feet.
Just give me six months and then you can go.
I promise, I'll never ask anything from you again, but please, give me six months.
Sorry, I left my coat here.
[whistling a tune]
[waiter] I got it.

What'd I tell ya?
The other spiders have my back.
Another reason I can now handle anything life throws at me.
FURY:
Nice work, Spider-Man.
Dr. Octopus has been evading us for months.
No problem!
You know how sometimes people have great days?
Well, I'm only having great days.
Flash, I need to study your brain.
Whoa!
No one's ever said those words to me before.
Ock caught me off guard, but you and Spider-Man can anticipate danger.
You have no idea how helpful Spider-Sense is.
It warns me before a bad guy attacks.
Even before I bite into a pizza that's too hot!
Okay.
So I'm not gonna study all of your brain.
Just the part that works with Spider-Sense.
Excellent training of those two, as well as heading your other teams.
Every member of S.H.I.E.L.D. Academy has improved because of your leadership.
Really?
Even Nova?
FURY:
Especially Nova.
You've come a long way, Spider-Man.
That's why I'm promoting you to S.H.I.E.L.D. student instructor.
Congratulations.
(GIGGLING)
(CHUCKLES)
Spider-Man, now, don't let this go to your head.
I would never.
You're gonna be here a long time, Doc.
I'd get used to your new accommodations, if I were you.
Oh, I will.
With a few changes,
I could feel very much at home here.
(GROWLING)
What's he doing?
(GROWLING)
Stand down, prisoner!
I assure you that Swarm definitely has no control over what's happening.
(EXPLOSION)
(AGENTS SCREAMING)
(ALARM BLARING)
Situation report.
Now!
Did Iron Man hit the windshield again?
(ALARM CONTINUES)
Look out!
Hmm.
Radar's coming back negative.
We can't see who's attacking!
You can't see what's out there because it's in here.
Swarm nanobots.
I'll give you eight guesses who's behind this.
Doc Ock was a Trojan Horse.
Trojan Octopus, technically.
What?
But who's being technical?
We need to get to the cellblock.
These nanobots aren't making it easy to get to the prison section.
DR. OCTOPUS:
No need to chase me, Spider-Man.
I'll make it easy on you.
The thing about having the most brilliant mind on Earth...
"Most brilliant"?
And you chose that haircut?
...is that I can predict exactly what your pathetic web brain will do!
You brought me inside S.H.I.E.L.D.
What happens next is your fault.
How many times have I taken you down on my own, Ock?
Now, with S.H.I.E.L.D.'s help?
Man, I'd hate to be you right now.
You're not the only one with help.
(EXPLOSION) (GRUNTING)
DR. OCTOPUS:
Remember my Spider-Soldiers?
Well, I've created a new army.
I think you'll like their design.
You thought I'd like Goblin soldiers?
Oh, I get it.
Sarcasm!
I hate sarcasm!
(GRUNTING)
Where are you going, Spider-Man?
My Goblin army wants you to come out and play!
Goblin soldiers!
This is worse than my dream where Fury shows up to S.H.I.E.L.D. Academy in his underwear.
Hey, I'm no happier about it than you are.
FURY:
Nick Fury to Triskelion, come in!
Dr. Connors, do you read?
He's jamming the comms.
SPIDER-MAN:
At least we've got good cover.
Ah!
Whoa!
Uh, you know what?
Maybe I should just stop talking.
Agreed.
What are these nanobots doing to my Tri-Carrier?
(ELECTRICAL BUZZING)
They're eating it!
Why would Ock dissolve the Tri-Carrier while he's still on it?
He's crazy, but not that crazy.
(GUNSHOTS)
Ah!
Hey!
I was just telling everyone how crazy you aren't.
Okay!
I take it back!
You're the craziest person I know!
(YELLS)
(LAUGHING EVILLY)
Fighting Goblins is hard enough without having the room constantly changing around me.
Wait.
I can use that to my advantage.
(GROANS)
Hey, guys!
We can tell when we're not wanted.
See ya!
Thanks, Spider-Man.
No need to thank me for saving you.
It's what I've been trained to do.
I was saying...
Thanks, Spider-Man, for trapping us in a room with no way out.
Oh!
Again with the sarcasm.
But hey!
At least we're safe!
(RUMBLING)
Walls closing in?
Really?
Too bad your mouth doesn't have a Spider-Sense for being wrong!
(GRUNTING)
Not interested in becoming the Ultimate Spider-Jam!
(GROANING)
(MOANING)
(DEFLATING)
IRON SPIDER:
You were right, Cho!
They are in here!
Did you get any data about the tactical deployment of the Goblin troops?
VENOM: "Tactical de..." What?
We were in my lab when we heard the explosion.
And the walls started to warp.
We came straight to find you.
(GUNSHOT) Not this time, pal.
Hey!
It worked!
(ROARING)
(SCREAMING)
(IRON SPIDER SCREAMS)
Whoa.
Cho!
You sensed that?
Digital Spider-Sense.
Just designed it.
I'm so genius.
My brain was totally useful.
Celebrate later.
Iron Spider, my comms are jammed.
Can you get a message to the Triskelion?
I'm not getting through.
SPIDER-MAN:
Your systems are jammed too?
Not our systems.
Theirs.
The Triskelion's also under attack?
Can you scan the Swarm nanobots?
I have a feeling they're not just destroying this place.
What?
You're right!
They're rebuilding the Tri-Carrier.
Into what?
(ENGINE ROARING)
DR. OCTOPUS:
Into your worst nightmare.
(CACKLING)
How are you pulling this off, Ock?
It's 10 steps up from your usual plan of trying to trap, hurt, and generally insult me.
I learned by watching you, Spider-Man.
You are not the only one capable of building a team.
You're saying I inspired this plan of yours?
The greatest enemies of S.H.I.E.L.D. have finally joined forces...
Doctor Otto Octavius and HYDRA.
Zola.
Nicholas Fury.
Your S.H.I.E.L.D. Tri-Carrier is no more.
We transformed it into the new home of HYDRA.
Hail HYDRA!
DR. OCTOPUS:
Hail HYDRA!
(LAUGHING)
SOLDIERS:
Hail HYDRA.
Arnim Zola and Ock are besties?
Did no one get the memo this was supposed to be a perfect day?
ZOLA:
Today heralds our rebirth!
S.H.I.E.L.D.'s high-tech zeppelin has become something greater!
You did what to my Tri-Carrier?
(SCREAMING)
(GRUNTING)
Seriously, guys?
Don't you know never to mess with a superspy's favorite hovering boondoggle?
(GRUNTING)
(ELECTRICITY CRACKLING)
I'll teach you about playing with other people's toys.
Get them, you fools!
(GRUNTING)
Cho, the last time we fought Swarm, you said you were developing an anti-Swarm transmitter device.
Tried, but couldn't get the anti-nanobots to adjust to the changes in the Swarm.
You think you could use the digital Spider-Sense you created to teach the anti-Swarm how to react?
Yes!
You're a genius!
Well, I'm a genius, but you're a genius about my genius.
Okay.
You guys are using a whole lot of words.
Just tell me, can we stop the Tri-Carrier from changing?
Yes, and maybe even reverse it!
The only problem, my lab's probably melted into a HYDRA armory or something.
We have to get you down to the Triskelion.
It's still covered with Goblin Gliders.
I don't know if I can make it in there, let alone back out.
I can get you past their defense.
I'll be your blocker, dude.
I made all-state three years in a row!
(YELLING)
What does that even mean?
(SCREAMING)
Is that sports talk?
(BOTH GRUNTING)
Heads up, Goblins!
(GRUNTING)
Midtown High Varsity rules!
(GRUNTING)
I seem to have touched a nerve, Nicholas.
I've got a plan.
Follow my lead.
Lead fast.
(GRUNTING)
Time to admit defeat, Spider-Man.
Is it?
My watch must be off.
(GROWLS)
(YELLS)
(SNARLING)
Fury, now!
(BOTH GRUNTING)
No!
That's enough!
If you two can't play nicely...
That web fluid will hold them, but not for long.
How are you, big guy?
Fine.
Barely felt that.
Yeah.
Sounds like it.
Except I think your broken ribs may have broken ribs.
(SCREECHING)
If Cho's transmitter device is going to work, then we've got to get topside.
Sorry about this.
(GRUNTS) (BONES CRACK)
Ah!
No.
Leave me, Spider-Man.
Are you kidding?
Who's going to berate me while I save the day?
(FURY GROANING)
Strap in.
It's gonna be a bumpy ride.
Sorry.
Sorry.
Sorry.
Sorry.
(GROANING CONTINUES) Sorry.
Sorry.
Sorry.
Sorry.
Warned you.
Huh?
Whoa.
Whatever architect designed this needs some serious therapy.
My Tri-Carrier, look what they've done to her.
(GROANS) "Her?"
You have a more serious relationship than I thought.
Whoa!
There is nowhere to hide on my HYDRA island.
Not to brag, but I designed it myself.
What'd I say?
FURY:
Ahhh!
(GRUNTING)
Okay, we might be totally cornered, but at least the view's nice.
(YELLS)
Ahh!
(GRUNTS)
You are at the edge of defeat, Spider-Man.
The Goblin army is finishing off your friends.
No one can help you.
Oh, yeah?
What do you call that?
One missile against my entire island?
Ha-ha!
You are a fool.
It's not a missile.
It's much more annoying.
Nova to the rescue!
(GRUNTS)
(NOVA YELLS)
NOVA:
What?
'Sup, web-head?
Heard you're in trouble, like always.
Iron Spider said to give you this blah-blah-nerdinator.
It's the anti-Swarm transmitter.
Yeah, just like I said.
Set it off.
I gotta get it to the highest point.
No problemo.
Let's do this.
(GROANING)
No.
Fury's injured.
He needs medical help now.
What about you?
You know me.
I've got this.
Right.
You always do.
Was that sincerity or sarcasm?
What do you think?
(GROANS)
That wasn't an answer!
SPIDER-MAN:
So today's had some speed bumps, but I can still turn it back into the best day ever.
Like I said before, I've got this covered!
(TRANSMITTER BEEPING)
Yes!
Total victory.
Who's back on top?
This guy.
Ock?
Noble effort, Spider-Man, but your victory was short-lived, as you will be.
(GRUNTING)
You are a terrible hugger.
(LAUGHING)
(GRUNTING)
Whoa!
Ugh.
No!
(SCREAMING)
(MUFFLED YELLING)
No.
No.
HYDRA can't win.
ZOLA: (ON SCREEN) Attention, citizens of New York, we have overthrown the tyrant Nick Fury and his agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.
Kneel before your saviors and hail HYDRA.
Oh, no, Peter.
Please be okay.
It's gone.
My friends, S.H.I.E.L.D.
It's all gone.
Except me.
I'm still the Ultimate Spider-Man.
I can do this.
(SCOFFS) Do what?
(SPIDER-MAN GASPS)
You couldn't even save yourself.
Who are you?
I'm the guy that pulled you from the bottom of the bay.
You're welcome.
Also, I pried this off of you.
Webs?
You're a spider too?
Not just a spider.
The first spider.
The what?
I was born in the post-war period.
At that time many things were developed.
A time of new invention.
Many things to do.
Full of opportunity.
From young, I loved to sing.
People say I have a great voice.
So, thinking of joining the singing competition because I wanted to be a singer.
Where's Parnward?
- No idea.
Who is going to sing then?
Well, you come with me!
But I couldn't make it.
How many times have I told you not to sing!
Because my parents hated me singing.
They said singing for money is no good.
Then, there was a guy who liked me so I decided to run away with him.
Thinking perhaps he could help me follow my dream becoming a singer.
But, I ended up doing nothing.
Only bad things kept happening.
Terrible things.
And, the worst thing was...
One hot tea.
- What?
I got old when I realized all this.
One hot tea.
What?
- One hot tea!
Okay.
That is all!
Wait!
Do you know what helped me go through all this?
What are you smiling at?
It's my son!
Okay, everyone.
Today let's talk about the elderly.
Let's start with a question.
Why do young people think old people are annoying?
No one?
If you're not going to answer I will assign you a report instead.
Yes?
Old people are forgetful, and they don't admit it.
Hold on!
I ordered hot tea, not coffee.
Coffee!
Don't get on my nerves.
I ordered...
Quiet!
Just drink it!
It's the same hot stuff!
Old people also fart loudly.
Who was that?
Gosh, the smell!
Just poop it out if you were going to fart like that?
I better not catch you doing it.
Yes?
- It's such a waste to get old.
Be careful!
You won't die of old age.
I would rather die before I ever get old.
Pong must be very smart.
He has a Ph.D.
And, he is an Associate Professor!
Right!
How many times I have to tell you?
So tiring!
Well, well!
If so tiring, why don't you just not talk about him?
Is there any day you don't brag about your son?
So what?
It's my son's success.
Getting on your wrinkly nerves?
You keep bragging about how your son is an Assistant Professor.
So why did he let his mother wear rotten shoes...
Can't compare with my son!
He managed to work in the US.
He even sends me plane tickets so I can go and visit him.
Where is it?
Look here.
I just took a photo for my visa application.
Is it beautiful?
Yeah, it is.
- Beautiful?
Just great for a funeral portrait.
Shut up, you old hag!
Chian, can I have one Americano, please?
One Americano, my foot!
Whenever you come here, you only order Thai black tea.
Now you act posh?
Want to order Americano?
What a snobbish hag!
Am I getting on your wrinkly nerves?
Please, stop it!
Granny Parn did this again, didn't she?
No, it wasn't her.
Don't blame her.
I just don't get it.
What do you see in her?
She's got a big mouth, and an awful personality.
Talking behind my back?
Because of your foul mouth, you can't find a husband.
You may have to live off your parents forever!
Look what you did to my dad.
Here is for you!
- Thank you.
Aren't you going to apologise?
- For what?
He was the one who got in my way.
I'm going now.
- Wait, Miss Parn.
I'll take you home.
- No need, I can manage it myself.
Let her go.
I'm sure even hell won't welcome her.
She is right.
With your foul mouth and ugly face you will never find a husband.
It is not that I can't find one.
I am just afraid to run into a mother-in-law like her.
Don't tell me you don't want a husband.
Dad...
- Stop it!
Look at your face!
It's all swollen.
You know you're allergic to rambutan, why do you eat it!
Wait.
How many times have I told you not to put in the fish until the water is boiled?
Sorry!
Why are you standing here?
Move, go over there.
Don't stir when boiling fish, it has a fishy smell.
I told you this million times, so stupid!
Where are you going?
To audition.
Audition?
What audition?
I thought you promised me you'd only play music as a hobby.
Look at your sister, she studied day and night at school and she is still jobless after graduating.
Job is difficult to find, mom.
Not so difficult if you go for the interview on time.
Boom!
- Enough, stop it!
What is it so good about playing music?
Hey, be nice to your son!
What it is so bad about playing music?
My baby.
Take this money and get something to eat, okay!
Granny.
- It's okay, baby.
Can I have 1 ,000 baht more?
- What?
Even the chicken basil costs about 50 baht.
Here!
Don't spend it all at once!
Thank you, grandma.
My baby.
You are his mother, you should understand him!
Sorry!
- What is wrong being a singer?
Hey, Bam!
Can't you dress more properly?
Your shorts!
It is too revealing of your womanhoood.
If it doesn't show, how will you know I am a woman!
You brat!
I wonder where she got that attitude from?
Sorry!
Are you okay?
Don't mind my mother.
You know how she is.
I can't stand mother anymore.
I'm sick and tired of all this, and...
Thank you.
I am going off now, mom.
- Okay!
Work hard, son!
Alright.
What kind of a wife are you?
You should come out here and send him off to work!
Sorry!
Toey, where did you find this band?
When they called me, they said, they're an Indie band.
I just didn't know it would be this bad.
You idiot!
Don't you know this kind of music won't get us a penny?
Get them out of here.
- Okay!
What a waste of time.
Hey!
Stop now!
No more nonsense!
Get lost!
Get lost!
Go somewhere else.
What a stupid song!
Don't ever come here again!
Can we have one more try?
- Yeah, can we have one more try?
I mean, just me.
Forget the band!
- Okay.
How can you say that?
What about our Huay Kwang band?
Forget the band.
It looks hopeless.
Watch your mouth!
- Why should I?
What kind of a band name is Huay Kwang?
You'll never be famous!
- Come on, Nana.
Don't do this.
Hey, she will stay here.
You guys, get better go now before I lose my patience.
Before I beat you guys up!
Go!
Go!
So, kids now can't sing anymore.
I think they're all right.
We just need to tune a little bit.
But if you still don't like them, I have a few more.
Look over there.
The "Six-Packs" band.
I am off now.
What a waste of time!
Nut!
What kind of a singer do you want then?
If you don't choose now, we will fall behind schedule.
I want a singer who can really sing.
Not just someone getting into character.
Ever heard of the old-school singers?
They sing with their real inner feeling.
I understand but we can't find one like that not with this generation.
We may have to look for old singers then.
Then let's go together this weekend to see real singers.
He is so handsome and cute even when he gets angry.
Him?
Such a self-centred punk!
Let me handle him!
You know he isn't into a guy like you.
Hey, I'm your senior.
Wait up!
Hello, beautiful.
- Don't patronize me!
Which one do you like?
I've seen you several times.
Like this one?
You want this?
How much?
-399, please.
How about 99?
What?
Who taught you to bargain like this, grandma?
Grandma, my foot!
So, deal or no deal?
No!
I won't sell this!
Get lost!
This way please.
Expensive like this, who is going to buy?
I'm sure you will be out of business soon.
Stingy hag!
- Who're you calling stingy?
No one.
Why don't you turn the lights on?
Don't you know my eyes are not good?
Nok.
Mom!
Boom, Hurry!
- Stay with us mom!
Mom.
- Nok.
She is conscious.
Mom!
How are you feeling, mom?
Didn't I tell you to do some exercise?
You never listen to me!
What do you want?
Your husband?
Well, go to her.
What?
- Why are you whispering?
Have lots of fruits here, so tell me what you want.
Just tell us what do you want.
- Mom.
Everyone is worried about you.
What is it?
She asked you to leave, mom.
Be careful!
You be careful!
You are very lucky.
This time it's not that serious.
But, if you don't want to be a widower you should take better care of your wife.
If she comes here again, you might not be so lucky then.
Don't you worry about mom?
She almost died because of granny.
But we can't do this to granny.
What's wrong with the nursing home?
There are people to take care of her she has food and friends too!
If it is so great, why don't you stay there?
Dad, what do you think?
Here, let me take it!
You go and take a rest.
Here come your favourite soap opera!
Let me take a shower first and fix a meal for you guys soon.
Mom, as soon as Nok gets better I will bring you back.
Just take good care of your wife.
If something goes wrong again, you can't blame me then!
Are you okay, Miss Parn?
Parn?
It's really you.
I thought I would never see you again.
I'm Supha from Petch market.
You've got the wrong person.
- Of course not.
How can I forget you?
My mom took you and your son in.
She save you and your boy from the street and gave you a job at our restaurant.
But you stole my mother's recipe and opened another restaurant.
How could you do this to us?
How could you?
My mother died because of you!
Enough.
Stop it!
Go ahead!
Do as you wish!
I have no regrets.
Even if I go back, I'd still do the same.
I did everything for my boy.
Because of me, he's now an Asst. Professor.
Teaching in a university.
No other mother could do better than me.
My son knows it well.
Hello, granny!
- Yes, dearie?
Let's eat dinner together.
Why don't you eat at home?
I don't want to see Bam.
No, you both have to take care of each other.
I'll be gone soon, so don't make me worry.
I don't want you to go.
Please, come and join me for dinner.
Okay.
Let's go to Kwan Siu Ki.
Is that all right?
Because I got my friends here with me.
Bring them too.
- Okay.
I'll practice with my band a bit more.
See you then, dearie.
Yeah.
Who is that up at the front?
Audrey Hepburn.
Wow.
So beautiful!
How old is she now?
She died long time ago.
I didn't take many photos when I was young.
I didn't put make-up either.
But, you must when you were young.
I almost got to be singer.
I was told Kru Eua came to see me singing but my parents found that out first.
As you know, people in our generation it wasn't easy to become a singer.
And I spent all my youth raising my son.
But, you still look great now.
You know how to talk.
I hope your photo is as good as you talk.
I want to have a beautiful photo for my funeral portrait.
No worries, I'll make you look 50 years younger.
Hey!
Hey, wait for me!
Where are you are rushing to?
Stop!
Stop the bus!
Can't you here me?
I was calling you!
If the bus doesn't pick up passenger, just get lost!
Open!
Open quickly!
Let's go!
Hey.
Wow, check that out!
Here I come.
Is this a human or an angel?
Will you call me if I give you my phone number, babe?
No way!
Then, give me your phone number, I will you call you, babe!
See!
She even gave me a seat!
Can we have a shot together, babe?
So I can tell my mom she has found a daughter-in-law.
You ready?
1 , 2...
How is it?
Surprised at my handsome face?
Let's take one more.
Who is this?
Let us say it's our first photo together.
How old am I?
Maybe 19?
Hey, how old am I?
-20, maybe?
Hey, how old am I?
-20.
What's the problem?
You're not eating, I thought you were hungry.
My grandma isn't picking up her phone.
You're worried about her?
No, because I don't have any money.
Kitchen is closing.
Want to order more?
One more roast duck, please.
- Roast duck.
I told you I don't have money.
Why did you order more?
Don't spoil my appetite.
I'm buying time for your granny.
Hey, what if she doesn't show up?
I already know you would ask me that.
That!
We can pawn it for now and get it back when we have money.
Kae!
- Yeah?
That is my guitar.
I'm on my way.
Almost there, I'm now at...
Come quickly, grandma.
I have no money.
Why does your voice sound weird?
Kid, kitchen is closed.
- I'm just here for my grandson.
Hello?
What is it?
That ringtone sounds like my granny's.
Come back again, okay?
- Where you going?
You need a lift?
- Hey!
Where is the photo studio?
What photo studio?
Never heard of it.
What?
There was a photo studio right here!
I went there only few minutes ago.
Don't go inside!
What bad luck!
Get lost!
Go away!
- Get lost!
Do I look younger than you guys?
You crazy woman!
Go away!
My guitar!
How can I practice now?
Uncle Chian.
- How are you?
Mom is missing.
- What?
Miss Parn is missing?
Boom is the last one who talked to her.
And, she has gone missing.
No one has seen her.
Maybe she fell somewhere?
No way!
She is as strong as a beast.
Someone kidnapped her for a ransom?
I think...
- Who would do that?
People would think she's from a poor family.
You're not helping us, so stop talking!
What can we do now?
I'm not sure yet...
Dad?
Forget it.
Anything else?
If she calls you, please let me know.
Of course.
- Well, I should go.
Wait!
If you need a ransom, let me know.
I'll sell this house for the money.
Okay.
Selling this house?
Are you crazy?
Where will I live then?
I have no husband yet!
So what?
Where is the bird?
I have no idea.
Here.
Let me have Mr Suraphong to say something for her.
Please.
Mom was a good person.
And, she died in a nursing home.
Cheers!
- Cheers!
Cheers!
- Cheers!
Cheers!
She died in a nursing home.
Lower your arm.
Breathe in.
Breathe out.
One hot tea.
Being old is not easy.
I used to be like them.
That broccoli-looking hair style.
I used to have it too.
Did I look that ugly?
God gave me this second chance and I'm not going to be like that again.
This one?
- Yeah.
Okay, thank you!
Give me the change.
One baht!
Oh, okay.
Thank you, beautiful.
Beautiful, my foot!
Want to rent a room?
It's 5,500 baht, excluding bills.
3 months rental in advance for deposit.
You think I'm stupid?
Your dad set the price at 4,500 including bills.
You know my dad?
No, I just heard about it.
You want the room or not?
- I'll take it.
But, 3,500 is enough.
The room is small, and no tenant for years.
You should thank me instead.
Okay?
Dad, she is our new tenant.
What's your name?
Pa...
It's Parn.
I'm going to the room now.
Hey, wait!
Pay deposit in advance!
I'll pay it later.
What is it, dad?
- Letter from grandma?
I'm going away, so don't bother me.
To where?
Where?
Where?
Here you go.
Who's that girl over there?
My new tenant.
What's she doing here?
No idea.
She said she's very close to her grandma and she likes being with old people.
So weird!
Nut, what are we doing here?
- Just wait and see.
You like this kind of music?
I think we picked the wrong one.
Not always like this.
Let's go!
Let's go back.
Grandpa Chian.
Any news from with Miss Parn?
Not yet.
I'm here to ask you the same.
I have a sore throat today, so I couldn't sing well.
Thank you.
Don't worry!
I'll help you find her.
Miss Parn used to sing this song in the old days.
Hello, ma'am!
I am going now!
I'm sorry.
Today he'll find know the truth!
I always love this part.
Yeah, especially back in Aranya's version, I...
How do you know?
Were you born then?
I'm going to bed now, grandpa!
Hey, wait a bit!
They'll find out the truth soon.
So stay and watch!
Hi, Grandpa Chian.
- Hey.
Hi, Boom!
Parn.
This is Boom, a grandson of my closed friend.
He wants to talk to you.
Take your time.
This time for sure!
For sure!
Today, I have to know the truth ofwho you are.
Buy drinks forgirl.
This is howyou spent the money I gave you.
It's a bit weird.
How we met the first time and now we are here.
I'm worried about this country's future.
You must be very shy, aren't you?
You can't even look at me when I'm talking.
No way!
You're the one who can't.
Wait a minute.
When your grandpa talked to me the first time exactly the same.
This might be too early to say this.
But, I have something to tell you.
The way of talking exactly the same as your grandpa hitting on me!
Please!
Oh no!
No way!
I...
- No way!
I want you to be our lead singer.
You can't?
Understood.
Someone with a good voice like you is not suitable for a crappy band like us.
I know we stink.
The lead singer left the band, and my mom isn't well.
Wait!
You want me to be your lead singer?
But I kind of understand.
A crappy band like us has no future...
Sure, I'll do it.
Really?
- Yeah!
Are you sure?
- Yes!
Yes!
Who is that?
The one we've been looking for.
She knows old songs.
Singing from the bottom of her heart.
I can feel it, Nut.
Very good!
I knew it!
No one beats that brat with bangs.
Wow!
Are you ready?
One, two!
One, two, three, go!
Hey!
What kind of a song is this?
Why?
I composed this myself.
Not bad, right?
Nonsense!
Did your parents know all these?
What kind of an outfit is this?
Looks terrible!
You don't understand this kind of style.
This isn't even a style.
Real singing is, you should catch the people's heart.
Not just screaming like that.
I won't sing this kind of music.
Then, what kind of music you want to sing?
See!
Why are you dancing?
Hey, this band is so good!
You should bring this band here.
Actually, this is the same band you saw the other day.
Enough!
See what we have here.
Cheers!
Let's eat!
Guys, when we have our own concert I will get that guitar back for sure and play it on stage.
That's it!
Here we come!
To Huay Kwang Keang!
Open the door.
I said, open the door!
I said it a million times!
Boy!
Can't you see me here?
You're supposed to give a seat to women like me.
Why do you cry, baby?
Why?
I've already changed your diapers.
The baby must be hungry!
He already ate few hours ago.
Maybe you fed him too little?
Let me help you.
You will be okay, baby.
- Thank you!
Listen!
Dress him up properly before taking him out.
You need to have both socks and gloves.
They turn on air conditioner here, so very cold inside.
The baby can get cold.
Feeding him your breast milk?
No, because he gets diarrhoea easily.
I knew it!
You had breast surgery, didn't you?
When you breastfeed the baby must go one by one, not switching here and there.
Maybe you are afraid your breast will sag unevenly.
What a crazy thought!
Breastfeeding is the best for baby and good for you too.
If you have a good milk, the baby will be fat soon.
What a noisy brat here!
Do you even have your own baby?
And, my milk bothering you?
So, is your milk is that great?
If so, just give it to your baby, and don't bother me.
Let me out!
What a big mouth!
Beautiful face like you, such a foul mouth.
Getting off here!
Mine is not so bad.
badh182 ( Malaysia Subbers Crew)
Why are you following me?
Calm down, miss.
Thing is you're very impressive.
I am looking for a singer.
So perhaps we can go somewhere and talk?
You come to place like this and find a singer?
You think I'm stupid?
You think I'm that easy?
Wait!
Sorry, I didn't mean that.
Being young is troublesome for sure!
What took you so long?
Freaking hot out here.
Hello!
- Hi, guys.
Mom, this is Parn.
Hello.
- Hi!
Boom told me you were sick.
I'm good now.
Well, you acted like you're dying soon then.
So this is Parn?
So pretty!
Where did you get your plastic surgery?
I wonder where she got that mouth from.
Sorry, Parn!
My sister's got a bad mouth.
Must be from my granny!
That's alright.
Mom, I'll take my friends upstairs.
Okay.
Make yourself at home.
I'll call you when dinner is ready.
- Yeah!
You'll be eating up all the foods here.
Mom, can I have more rice?
Come in.
I want to show you something.
- What is it?
There is an audition for "Young Blood".
"Young Blood"?
The famous TV show?
Awesome!
You guys up for this?
- Of course!
What about you, Parn?
- I need to poop!
I'm going to the toilet.
You already know where the toilet is?
Well, where is it?
- Go out and turn right.
I don't think your mother ran away.
From CCTV, you can see this person isn't your mother.
Miss Parn.
Do you have a better angle?
We asked the bank already and will get it in a week.
Why does it take so long?
There is some protocol, sir.
Can't you just rush them?
I know some big names in this station.
Who is it?
- The chief officer.
I'm the chief here!
Really?
So, chief, what should I do next?
Is there other way, sir?
We just need to wait for the footage.
I'll contact you as soon as we get it.
How is it?
- It's super delicious, mom.
It stinks.
I mean a bit smelly.
When putting in the fish, you need to wait until the water boils.
And, don't stir the fish.
My granny taught me this.
Dad isn't home yet?
Why?
- Yeah, why?
Why?
Who is that?
- Oh, hey.
I was going to the toilet.
But false alarm.
Who is it?
Dad, this is Parn, lead singer of my band.
Hello.
- Hello.
You are not eating?
I'm not hungry.
Mom, I think dad has never met a beautiful girl like her.
You should've told me you were a producer.
I was going to tell you, but didn't get a chance.
I am...
You're professional, so don't mind the small things, right?
Let's get to the point.
When you performed I realized I found what I wanted.
I have a big concert coming up.
I want you to do the opening.
But, isn't it too risky?
To use a new singer?
I've already made my decision.
I'll take a full responsibility.
But...
- Stop it!
And, for next week I want your band to play at Young Blood.
Think it as a rehearsal before the big concert.
The Young Blood?
Yeah, it would be nice to have emerging stars like you.
Nice?
It's more than nice!
Brother, this is very awesome.
You're the man.
So, okay with this?
We'll see you next week then.
Let's go.
The famous TV show you guys're talking about?
Yes!
That mean you are talented!
Good job.
- Well, I'm talented too.
I don't think so.
You're dead!
Trying to hit a woman?
What kind of a man are you?
Okay, I'll take off the tape, but don't make a sound.
Got it?
You evil!
You murderer!
Watch out!
Show me your real face!
What have you done to Miss Parn?
You killed her and threw her off the bridge?
What?
- Fine!
Kill me too then.
Without Miss Parn, I don't want to live anymore.
You have been watching too many soap operas.
You wouldn't understand.
She was so nice to me.
She always smiled at me.
I would never forget her smile.
Why the hell are you smiling?
Take your smiley face away!
Go!
Fine.
I'll go away then.
Let's play together.
Miss Parn.
You look beautiful with that fake teeth!
These are real.
The other day I had barbecue, I could even chew the bone.
Must be so nice to be young again.
Next week I'll be on TV.
Wow, you are going to be a star?
No, I'm going to sing.
You know I've always wanted to be a singer.
Of course.
I remember you went to singing competitions.
Do you remember the day when I sang after Lumyai?
There was a music producer who saw me singing.
I won't miss you on TV.
By the way, Phong has been looking all over for you.
Why now?
Come on.
He's really worried about you.
Okay, I need your help.
But, don't act suspiciously.
Why are they whispering?
You see, a few days ago, Miss Parn came to see me.
How is she?
You see, she said she's just fine no need to worry about her.
Where is she now?
Why isn't she coming home?
You see she said she wanted to live the life of her own.
Why do you keep saying, "you see"?
Why are you asking so many questions?
Well, when I saw, she looks very healthy.
Maybe even more healthy than you two.
What do you mean more healthy compared to us?
It's just...
Did she say when she'll be back?
Probably in a while.
She said once she spent some time she'd stay with someone she loves.
Love?
Who is it?
You mean she's going to kill herself?
Mom!
No!
It's me, of course.
You?
- Yeah!
One more thing.
It's important.
She asked you to unfreeze her credit card.
I see.
She probably needs some cash by now.
Please tell her, I'll take care of it.
What're you doing here?
What?
Nosy brat!
Take care of yourself.
Your dad is up to something.
What did you say?
- Your dad is up to something!
What do you mean?
With that brat, Parn.
- Why?
She has some plan to get her hands on him.
Why is that?
He will be dead soon anyway.
Exactly.
Once he dies...
Chian!
...she will get everything.
Be careful!
Otherwise, you have to call her mom.
Who's your mommy?
Who's your mommy?
What on earth are you doing?
Why did you ruin your nice bike?
And, don't you feel hot in that outfit?
What are you laughing at?
Get on!
Aren't you in a hurry?
Fine.
I'm leaving now.
What are you going to sing today?
You'll find out soon.
Don't worry, I'll nail this.
Yeah, just get inside.
Be careful.
- Of course.
What are you laughing at?
What are you waiting for?
Let's go!
I told you not to come here.
Seeing you in that outfit, how can I not come?
Too dangerous!
Pretty, right?
Don't even think about it!
Of course not!
I'm here to protect you.
I'm here to have some fun.
So, don't worry about others.
Just take care of yourself.
You're pissing yourself with just a little breeze.
Hey, grandpa.
You better take some rest.
You look so pale.
- You little brat.
The reason I'm not on that slider is because it's so boring.
Seriously, is there any ride that looks more exciting?
Here comes the big one.
You ready?
Yeah!
- Let's go!
Hey!
Are you okay?
Hey, old man!
Thank you.
How do you like?
- It's so fun here!
Didn't think it would be this much fun.
Look at the kids there.
You sound like an old woman.
When you're singing, you are like totally different person.
The audience really likes you.
I'm also excited.
Do you know a lot of people want to interview you?
Interview?
About what?
About you!
I'm also curious about you.
Working together for a while but still don't know about you well.
We can take it slowly.
No need to rush.
Right?
What happened to your foot?
Let me see.
- No, it's okay.
I have a first-aid kit in my bag.
I'll be right back.
Look!
It really got wrinkled.
This happened around the wound?
When I was bleeding, it turned out like this.
Is it related?
I'm going in.
Wait!
Do it softly.
I'm scared!
Hold on.
It's just a tiny prick.
Ouch!
Oh, look!
It's bleeding and gets wrinkled.
Hey, it's not what you think.
Having sex?
Not what you think!
Get out!
- Have you lost you mind?
Get out!
I said get out!
Cheap woman!
- Hey!
Stop it!
This is enough!
- Go away!
Miss Parn!
Let me go!
I said enough!
- Get out now!
Are you crazy?
I said stop!
Miss Parn.
Happy Birthday to you.
Nut
Do you want some drink?
Do you have any liquor?
Liquor?
- Yeah!
Is everything okay?
You have any problems?
No!
Your house is huge.
Live alone?
How do you clean this house?
I have a maid.
Why aren't you married?
Who said I'm not married?
Oh, you are married?
No!
Just kidding.
It's good to see you get surprised.
Boyfriend?
- What?
Do you have a boyfriend?
Right now, no.
I used to have a husband, but he died long time ago.
We had one son.
Now, there is a widower hitting on me.
He's only a friend, we've known each other for a long time.
Are you playing with me?
Okay, so you don't have a boyfriend now.
What kind of a guy do you like?
I like someone who is kind who takes care of his family hard working and good in bed too.
Sorry.
Hey!
No, I didn't mean...
- You, pervert!
No!
Pervert!
Phong!
- Hello, Uncle Chian.
What are you doing here?
Well...
- What is it?
It may sound difficult, but the truth is...
Yes.
If you have anything to tell me, just say it.
Actually Miss Parn didn't go missing.
The young Parn, she is Miss Parn.
I'm sorry.
You mean that young singer is my mom?
Told you it would be difficult to understand.
Quite so but I think I understand you.
I should have told you earlier.
Can you save this contact info?
Really?
That's good.
This friend of mine, he's a specialist in Alzheimer.
I'm sure he can help you.
081162...
What song are they playing?
"My Handsome Guy", Huay Kwang version.
They are going to sing this song at the concert.
No way!
Stop there!
We can't use this song for the concert.
I will find someone to write you a new song.
Let me call him now.
I think it should be okay.
Nut.
What's wrong with this song?
It's focusing too much on Parn.
Where is your band's true identity?
We do have our "Huay Kwang Kang" song.
You want to listen to it?
- Oh, that song?
You think that is good enough?
To be honest here without Parn, your band is nothing.
Boom.
Boom!
Boom!
Boom, wait!
Listen to me!
Don't act like this!
Please stop!
- Leave me alone!
Please stop!
Stop, Boom!
Boom!
Boom.
Listen, why are you doing this?
- Please don't bother me!
Just make new song with that jerk!
I'm done here!
- Calm down.
He only wished the best for us.
Us?
- Yeah!
Maybe only for you!
It is not like that!
Like what?
You slept with him, didn't you?
How could you say that?
Who taught you to say things like that?
You're just a kid, and how come so disrespectful?
Apologize now!
- Leave me alone!
I stink!
You keep looking down on yourself.
Don't you know how great you are?
You have a chance to do things you love.
Will you just simply let it go like this?
Boom!
Can I come in?
What's wrong?
You wouldn't understand.
I may understand when I hear it.
I think I will stop playing music.
I stink.
Someone said my song stinks too!
Anyone likes it?
Yeah, a few.
But you are quitting just because someone doesn't like it?
Don't you love what you do?
If you love something, don't give it up so easily.
If grandma is here, she would say the same thing.
You think she still misses us?
I would like to hear your song.
You want me to play?
- Yeah, I want to hear it.
Are you sure?
Have you seen Boom?
No.
Shame on him.
Such a talented kid, but a little temper.
He's still young and don't want to listen to others.
Just give him some time.
I'm sure he will come back.
Okay.
Aside from the band I have something to ask you.
Do you think it's possible for us to get to know each other more?
Are you hitting on me?
Yes, I am.
I understand.
No, it is not like that.
I need some time to think.
Okay, I will wait then.
This is for you.
Thank you.
Hey.
If you become young again what will you do?
Probably do something I never got to do back then.
Date every woman and do everything that makes me happy?
We have spent a lifetime already and what we have now is just a bonus.
In fact being old is not so bad.
I even miss the time fighting with Lumyai.
Speaking of her I haven't seen her lately.
Has she gone to the U.S. to see her son?
Here, I got you an Americano.
She didn't get to go after all.
Life is full of uncertainties.
Here comes what you've been waiting for.
The band that used to play on the street is now playing on stage here.
Huay Kwang!
I knew them well, especially the lead singer.
See!
Let's give them some time to prepare before we meet Huay Kwang.
Hey, Kae.
- What?
I think Boom has changed.
- Why?
Think about our new song.
It's totally different from our previous songs.
You think too much.
Just let him change the style if he wants.
Yeah, maybe new style is good.
I may ask him to play acoustic.
Oh, acoustic?
We need two guitars only.
Then, how about me?
Just sit and listen!
I have something for you to listen.
He said he composed this because of you.
What else did he say?
Can I borrow some money?
I need to get my guitar back.
What a kid!
The concert is about to start now.
Let's go.
Where is Boom?
- To get his guitar back.
When will he come?
-30 minutes?
I don't know.
Then, call him now!
Hello!
Yeah, on my way!
See you soon!
See you inside.
- Okay, see you.
I have something for you.
I thought about giving it to you after the concert but better to give it now.
Let me help you.
Thank you.
Boom should be inside.
About what you asked me before I have an answer.
But I want to tell you after the concert.
In a coma?
We should cancel it now!
Make way!
Coming through!
No!
We must play this song!
We put in through everything for today.
When Boom wakes up we can let him know how great his song was and how much the audience loved it.
Huay Kwang!
Why does it take them so long?
Yeah.
- Yeah.
Why does it take so long to meet each other?
Huay Kwang!
Boom.
I will do my best with this song so you have to fight your best too.
Why do you cry?
Who has the same blood type as the patient?
What type is it?
Can I give mine?
RH negative.
Anyone has that blood type?
Grandma!
Grandma has the same blood type as Boom.
Where is she?
I do.
I have the same blood type as Boom.
You can't do this.
You know what will happen to you when you give your blood.
Wrinkled skin.
Bad hearing.
Backache.
Ankle pain.
Bad memories.
Everyone wants to start over like you.
Wait!
I have something to ask you.
Do you know a woman?
She had to raise her son as a young mother.
She used to skip her meals so she could feed her baby son instead.
She worked very hard for money so her son could go to school.
If you know her please tell her don't go back to that ungrateful son who was trying to send her to the nursing home.
Alright.
Boom is waiting.
Mom!
Just go and live the life you always wanted.
Please don't do anything for this ungrateful son.
Boom is my son.
I will do everything to cure him.
So, just go, mom!
Where do you want me to go?
Why do you always ask me to leave?
Even if I die today and am reborn again I will still do the same thing because what I want to do the most is being your mom.
And I'm going to love Boom like I love you.
Excuse me.
I'm looking for a boy who was in a car accident.
Where is he?
- Wait a minute.
We have to hurry now.
I found him.
Did I choose the wrong path?
Did I pick the wrong choice?
Why must it always been like this?
I always do stupid things.
Maybe because I am a human being.
A normal person.
A woman.
A mother.
A grandma.
A weak person.
And coward.
Too coward to see anyone die.
Wow, that is great!
He is my baby.
Your baby son is sitting right here.
Your son, but I raised him.
So, I win!
Your son is also my grandson.
Why do we have to argue about this?
You keep bragging about your son.
Well, you have quite a big mouth now.
Trying to fight back!
I have a good teacher here.
Who is your teacher?
- You!
Everyone remembers what you complained!
Make it that way.
Don't forget to tell the mixer to lower the reverb.
Mom.
Just as I told you in the beginning.
I am not a smart person but, at least, I know what I am doing here.
It is the year 4032.
Man's destruction of the environment has created evolutionary aberrations known as Abbies that rule the earth.
One man saw the catastrophe coming.
He created an ark for mankind and selected a chosen few to sleep for 2,000 years and defy mankind's extinction.
Surrounded by mountains and protected by an electric fence, the last of humanity left alive on Earth do their best to survive in a town called Wayward Pines.
Previously on Wayward Pines...
Use the flamethrowers.
We're all still here because of you, CJ.
They learned how to use fire, they learned that the fields were important.
You make it sound as if the Abbies had a plan.
I heard you caught one of those creatures.
It's the first female we've ever seen.
Her palm... does it have a mark?
It's like a brand.
There is something exquisite about her.
Temporal gyrus.
Hers appears to be double the size of ours.
Do you think she can understand us?
The Abbies have reentered the valley outside the fence.
Are you sure the fence is impenetrable?
The fence is secure.
- What if you're wrong?
- Then we're dead.
We're safe.
Right, Dr. Yedlin?

Incoming!
We've got incoming!
...all the crops are dying.
Closer to home:
As Pacific Northwest residents, they do continue to welcome North Korean refugees.
Secretary of State Curry assured reporters yesterday that anyone crossing U.S. borders had been scanned for the H1R3 virus.
Was it a mistake?
Well, I suppose no one's really sleeping.
Oh, I checked your microscope with the moldy bread.
Your penicillin spores are multiplying.
Wish we'd thought of that sooner.
You didn't think it was important to tell me about this?
- It's... it's a tribal mark.
- That took a tool.
That took a design.
That took a tribe.
Look, she got in here, and none of you've been able to figure out how.
Jason is working on that and I'm confident...
She's not here by accident.
She understands.
And we better get what she understands, or it is over.
And how would we go about doing that?
We establish a system.
Yes, no.
Teach her a pattern, a common language, or... understand hers.
Just like that?
Taught my dog to go outside in two days.
She's smarter than that.
Abby Comprehension 101.
Associating images with meaning is the basis of all language.
I suppose if-if the female brain is superior, then...
Communication should be successful.
Maybe even easier than with our own species.
Hey, I'm-I'm so sorry about what's going on with your wife.
She was such a visionary at one point, with the little garages in the backs of the houses.
Now finds her only solace in heads of hair.
But, really, my-my condolences, truly.
But d-don't worry about anything.
Jason's going to find you another mate, I'm sure.
Maybe I've already found one.
What do they eat?
Uh, pellets made from leftover rations, mostly... why?
Are you wanting to reward her?
I'm not using it to reward her.
I'm using it to teach her.
- You ready?
- Okay.
Green.
Green means yes.
Yes.
It's for you, yes.
Red.
No.
No.
Hand.
Friend.
Friend.
Friend.
She's my friend.
Friend.
Am I supposed to eat one of these, now?
If you perform well.
Crown is leader.
Leader.
- Bow to me a little bit.
- I beg your pardon?
Listen, I'm trying to show her deference.
Don't get your ego into this.
It's 'cause I'm standing up and you're...
Just bow a little bit.
Leader.
Yes.
No.
Friend.
Leader.
And if she doesn't speak English, how does this help us move forward?
It's the same as when you go to a foreign country.
You grasp concepts, body language.
Say you walk into the middle of a family argument in some random apartment in, uh, North Korea.
You don't speak the language, but you know who's in power, who's at fault, who's scared, who's amused.
We can teach her, and she can teach us.
Beverly, now, the last time we talked, you were having a hard time with your marigolds.
I'm telling you stick with it.
They keep the pests away.
Huh?
Don't you listen to Harold.
He's still mad at me from that game last week.
Harold...
I told you I played pick-up in the Army, didn't I?
And massive explosions continued to be seen for miles away, as the air assault continues with no end in sight.
Civilians and...
This is an alert...
Please proceed...
You'll be given...
Hey!
Don't move!
I don't carry fire.
What?
Your metal.
- Please.
- Where are you from?
I haven't seen anyone in a while.
Clean.
I'm CJ.
Griffin.
Where are you coming from?
West.
You don't mean Old West?
Only fragments remain.
Yes.
It used to be beautiful.
Uh, how-how are the fish?
We're lucky the water's clean.
West.
Water's potable.
Anywhere closer...
You lost someone?
Didn't everyone?
Look at that one.
Hey.
Oh...
Oh, wow!
I'll go build a fire.
Listen, I have to go alone.
Why?
I left when I did just to make it easier.
How is this easier?
We would survive together.
No!
Who's helping you?
You're here... close, cared for.
I can't.
How can you not?
!
Help me!
Take me with you!
It's my job to take care of them.
Why not me?
!
Take me!
I'm sorry.
I can't.
Why do you have the right to be safe?
!
There are so many people we couldn't save.
All I can save you from is what's coming next.
You need to rest.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
We've been at this for hours.
Even if she picks up a card, you can't tell me it's anything more than dumb luck.
She'll prove it.
Give her food.
She'll understand that's her reward.
She wants them to have it.
It's empathy.
But not toward us.
How many times has she been touched and prodded and restrained?
There are other species that would kill us on sight.
Or have no compassion for their own.
Animals who consume their offspring in the name of survival, yet... she's putting the lessers above herself.
Yeah, her lessers, who are waiting outside to kill us any chance they get.
It's the mark on her palm.
Hassler said it was a symbol of power.
She's not just some chimp that's repeating a sequence for a cookie.
She's an intelligent being, and... maybe she can help us out of this mess.
Do you really think that's true?
You better hope it's true.
Because it's not just their minds.
I saw them electrocute themselves.
I saw them sacrifice themselves so others could get in here.
And then it's just... it's math.
And they have the numbers.
And they will win.
You look tired, baby.
Eileen.
Almost time to go back to sleep.
You're getting lazy.
Hmm.
I'm about to take you.
This was always your game.
I prefer it when we garden together.
My hands in the earth.
Watching what grows.
The soil under your nails.
You wash your hands so much, your skin will crack.
But I rub them.
The lotion that smelled like honey.
Tomatoes in the summer.
They never even made it inside.
I miss the smell of summer.
What does it smell like here?
I can't tell anymore.
I'm worried about you.
I knew there was a reason why you came today.
Is it now?
When we go?
Baby, that's not my job.
I wish this wasn't your job, but it is.
You can't come with me.
Soon.
Maybe soon.
Miles to go.
When I come home, when this is over,
I always thought I would be able to find you and lay next to you.
But the ground that you were in, it's not even there anymore, is it?
That's just dirt.
That's not me.
Oh, you were lifted from that dirt, and became part of the air.
While I lay here... preserved... cheating?
It's your job to be here.
But is it right?
It's what the world is now.
It won't be the world I recognize.
I've seen bombs falling like rain.
A sky that was green with poisoned light.
There were times I wanted to call out.
But I imagined my voice spinning around the world, coming back to me with no one left to hear it.
You can make the world whatever you want.
You have that power.
I don't want to be alone.
You're not.
Where is she?
Get her out.
- Get her out.
- Hey, hey.
- Wait!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
- She has the mark!
- We know, we know she has the mark, Adam.
Then why are you keeping her here?
Look, they are gathering for her.
They are coming for her, so we need to turn her over to them right now.
We don't know that that's what they want.
We don't know what they want, but she is here for a reason.
They didn't catch her.
She was sitting on a carousel.
She chose to be here.
That brand... that brand takes months to apply.
- I have seen them do it.
- Then tell me, what is it that provokes them to attack?
That's an excellent question, Dr. Yedlin.
Tell me, w-which card should we try for that?
You're both missing the point.
Those Abbies outside, they are gathering for her.
She is their leader.
That is what the brand is for.
Fine, so maybe we should be working so she can communicate with our leader.
Our leader.
You mean Jason?
Yeah, you've been gone a long time, Adam.
You have not been privy to the changes within Wayward Pines.
You're right, I've been gone a long time, Megan, but it's what's outside of Wayward Pines
- that should concern you!
- I'm calling Jason down.
He and Kerry are on the Mountain tonight.
You need to let her go.
- I need your help with her.
- Let her go.
Listen to me.
We're on the same side.
They vastly underestimated these creatures.
Yeah, and these people.
They are too stupid or too blind to do anything about it now.
I'm trying to rectify that.
You're too late.
_
Christopher.
Sir.
Is the world ready for us to begin construction?
Yes, last I checked, the soil, the air, it's all good.
Back to preindustrial levels.
What a privilege, for us to prepare for Group A's awakening.
I can only imagine what you've seen.
The world changing like sand sifting between your fingertips.
Yes.
Are you ready?
Let us go then, Christopher James.
Others are here?
Don't move.
Oh, my God.
I saw a man once, a long time ago, when he was beginning to change.
He was only the first step.
But you were right.
They shouldn't be here now.
The mutation should have run its course.
They should all be dead by now but they're here.
It didn't attack.
Maybe it's like any animal in its natural habitat.
If we don't provoke it...
This isn't any animal, CJ.
It's mankind gone wrong.
These things stopped being human quite some time ago.
We could go back to sleep.
If you didn't plan for this, maybe we should.
We need to get back to the others.
There's work to be done.
How can we live here?
I had hoped we wouldn't have to encounter them, but they're here;
this is the new reality, so we have to drive them away from here a-and then build a fence.
Over the settlement?
This isn't a settlement.
They don't possess our intelligence.
They don't possess our sense of community.
They lost all that a long time ago.
This is our land now.
Our land again.
I did plan for this.
I hoped I wouldn't have to see it when I woke up, but don't worry.
Humanity will win.
Megan claims you're establishing some sort of communication with the female?
We need a breakthrough before they do.
How many Abbies were here an hour ago?
And look at the monitors now.
There's over a thousand now.
We know that they're gathering.
Yeah, as an army would.
We need to release her now.
- You're giving her too much credit.
- Wayward Pines.
- It was theirs first.
- We made this town.
Yeah, on the ruins of their settlement.
To save humanity.
After we basically destroyed the entire planet.
Look, how old is she?
Huh?
How old is she?
About 30?
- Right?
- Blood tests show a mature
- female, yes.
- Don't you get it?
She was there when we took it away from her.
- She was there.
- Stop humanizing her.
Territoriality is not solely a human trait.
Yeah, well, we took it back.
What's wrong with that?
It's our nature to fight.
Nothing's wrong with that.
If you don't mind fighting and losing, them taking this place back and then ripping every one of us to shreds.
You have tried everything else.
They are surrounding us.
There are more of them every minute.
The only thing we have on our side right now is science, and that is telling us that this an intelligent species.
So, if we can find a way to maybe just even...
What?
Negotiate?
Why not consider it?
You're underestimating our power here.
- Pilcher always said these things...
- He said a lot of things, and that would be fine if Wayward Pines had remained in his head.
Maybe going down this road buys us more time.
I don't need another naysayer.
I don't think you know what you need right now.
I'm as surprised as anyone to be considering this, but even Megan has been swayed, now that an actual medical professional has weighed in.
Oh, I won't stand for your condescension.
I'm merely stating a fact.
You weren't even awake when we built this town.
I schooled you at the Academy and I've got no problem doing it now.
No, I never denied that you had a good head on your shoulders, but, technically, you were supposed to be contributing much more to the future of Wayward Pines.
- Are you kidding me?
- Fertility and survival go hand in hand here.
Kerry knows how important the program is.
- How could this be a priority...
- It is priority.
This really is the inmates running the asylum.
Has it not occurred to anybody in this room that while we're observing her, that maybe she's observing us?
Don't you want to come and meet everyone?
You all can welcome Group A without me.
Come on, CJ.
We've all worked so hard to finally be able to wake them up.
They'll be here any minute.
Come celebrate with us.
I'm having a hard time understanding your attitude here.
We are rebuilding the world.
I know, I saw the world fall, all of it.
I watched that, alone.
How can anyone say what humanity will be in 2,000 years?
How could we have known it would come to this?
How could we know what this time, this loss, would do to our souls?
He knew.
My soul is replenished.
I need you to have faith, CJ.
You say that the world fell but you're forgetting all of the people that Pilcher saved.
You are a part of that.
And what will you tell them?
Hmm?
Group A.
You'll cut the ribbon, you'll serve the corn bread.
Hmm?
And do you think they will be grateful that we stole them from the world they knew.
Do you think they will be able to comprehend what they lost?
- In time.
- In time.
Yes.
I had 2,000 years to let it go.
They will lose it in seconds.
Please, join us.
Group A should know what you've done for them.
I have confidence that they will appreciate the privilege of our continued survival here in Wayward Pines.
Oh, my God.
This isn't real.
Help me.
They're lying to us.
Stop.
Stop!
You can't leave me here!
Go, go, let's go.
This can't be true!
This isn't real!
Somebody please help!
Friend.
The people... in this town, here... friends.
Jason is our leader.
This is a waste of time.
Why is she cooperating?
I'm honestly just curious.
Given the way that we've treated them, why would she?
She's communicating, not cooperating.
If she can comprehend even more than these simple cards, then we move forward, we try to show her that not everybody in this room is her enemy.
You should want this to work.
You should want progress.
Nobody's worked harder for our survival than I have, but we're in a war here, Doctor.
Yes.
We are.
We have to try everything.
Friends.
Doc...
Doc, I wouldn't do that.
Stop, it'll kill you.
Dr. Yedlin, I...
Aah!
Get him out of there!
Any doubt that she controls them?
This experiment ends now.
No!
Stop!
Stop!
If they can learn, let's teach 'em some consequences.
Stop, stop!
Hey, think about it... if you kill her, we all die!
Kerry.
If she does control them, is killing her a risk you want to take?
I don't have an answer yet for what will end this war, but eliminating what I believe is a crucial piece of it is not what I would advise.
Or do my words not hold any weight for you anymore?
Of course they do.
Dr. Yedlin presents new information.
Let's think about what we can do with that before we waste it.
It's a cruel joke, isn't it?
Here we are, last of our species.
Best of what's left.
We can't even climb out of our own ruin to save ourselves.
You may be Jason's replacement.
But they're ours.
I've lived for many years in Wayward Pines.
I barely remember the world as it once was.
I worked hard to forget it.
But I'm so grateful to have come so far and to have seen so much.
It's been fascinating studying Margaret with you.
But at this point we can't conclude...
Are you so indoctrinated that you can't see that the only animal in this room was Jason?
I see his weaknesses, yes.
But we are not the lesser species here.
They are not our replacement.
I won't surrender to those kinds of thoughts.
I can't.
I'm sorry.
I'm going home.
I mean the hospital.
I'm gonna take a shower and try to clear my head.
I'll be back in a couple hours, and then we're gonna s...
I don't know what we're gonna do.
CJ.
You saw them first.
The Abbies.
Yes.
With Pilcher.
What do you think?
About?
Was it a mistake, commencing construction when we did?
Did we wake up too soon?
We've stolen centuries.
But that is a moment that we can't take back.
Why discuss it now?
We'll gather later to discuss protocol.
Wayward Pines did not journey into the future to grind to a halt at this.
I'll not allow it.
I assure you.
Humanity will win.
Oh!
Margaret.
It is the year 4032.
Man's destruction of the environment has created evolutionary aberrations known as Abbies that rule the earth.
One man saw the catastrophe coming.
He created an ark for mankind and selected a chosen few to sleep for 2,000 years and defy mankind's extinction.
Surrounded by mountains and protected by an electric fence, the last of humanity left alive on Earth do their best to survive in a town called Wayward Pines.
Previously on Wayward Pines...
Use the flamethrowers.
We're all still here because of you, CJ.
They learned how to use fire, they learned that the fields were important.
You make it sound as if the Abbies had a plan.
I heard you caught one of those creatures.
It's the first female we've ever seen.
Her palm... does it have a mark?
It's like a brand.
There is something exquisite about her.
Temporal gyrus.
Hers appears to be double the size of ours.
Do you think she can understand us?
The Abbies have reentered the valley outside the fence.
Are you sure the fence is impenetrable?
The fence is secure.
- What if you're wrong?
- Then we're dead.
We're safe.
Right, Dr. Yedlin?
_
Incoming!
We've got incoming!
...all the crops are dying.
Closer to home:
As Pacific Northwest residents, they do continue to welcome North Korean refugees.
Secretary of State Curry assured reporters yesterday that anyone crossing U.S. borders had been scanned for the H1R3 virus.
Was it a mistake?
Well, I suppose no one's really sleeping.
Oh, I checked your microscope with the moldy bread.
Your penicillin spores are multiplying.
Wish we'd thought of that sooner.
You didn't think it was important to tell me about this?
- It's... it's a tribal mark.
- That took a tool.
That took a design.
That took a tribe.
Look, she got in here, and none of you've been able to figure out how.
Jason is working on that and I'm confident...
She's not here by accident.
She understands.
And we better get what she understands, or it is over.
And how would we go about doing that?
We establish a system.
Yes, no.
Teach her a pattern, a common language, or... understand hers.
Just like that?
Taught my dog to go outside in two days.
She's smarter than that.
Abby Comprehension 101.
Associating images with meaning is the basis of all language.
I suppose if-if the female brain is superior, then...
Communication should be successful.
Maybe even easier than with our own species.
Hey, I'm-I'm so sorry about what's going on with your wife.
She was such a visionary at one point, with the little garages in the backs of the houses.
Now finds her only solace in heads of hair.
But, really, my-my condolences, truly.
But d-don't worry about anything.
Jason's going to find you another mate, I'm sure.
Maybe I've already found one.
What do they eat?
Uh, pellets made from leftover rations, mostly... why?
Are you wanting to reward her?
I'm not using it to reward her.
I'm using it to teach her.
- You ready?
- Okay.
Green.
Green means yes.
Yes.
It's for you, yes.
Red.
No.
No.
Hand.
Friend.
Friend.
Friend.
She's my friend.
Friend.
Am I supposed to eat one of these, now?
If you perform well.
Crown is leader.
Leader.
- Bow to me a little bit.
- I beg your pardon?
Listen, I'm trying to show her deference.
Don't get your ego into this.
It's 'cause I'm standing up and you're...
Just bow a little bit.
Leader.
Yes.
No.
Friend.
Leader.
And if she doesn't speak English, how does this help us move forward?
It's the same as when you go to a foreign country.
You grasp concepts, body language.
Say you walk into the middle of a family argument in some random apartment in, uh, North Korea.
You don't speak the language, but you know who's in power, who's at fault, who's scared, who's amused.
We can teach her, and she can teach us.
Beverly, now, the last time we talked, you were having a hard time with your marigolds.
I'm telling you stick with it.

I'm as surprised as anyone to be considering this, but even Megan has been swayed, now that an actual medical professional has weighed in.
Oh, I won't stand for your condescension.
I'm merely stating a fact.
You weren't even awake when we built this town.
I schooled you at the Academy and I've got no problem doing it now.
No, I never denied that you had a good head on your shoulders, but, technically, you were supposed to be contributing much more to the future of Wayward Pines.
- Are you kidding me?
- Fertility and survival go hand in hand here.
Kerry knows how important the program is.
- How could this be a priority...
- It is priority.
This really is the inmates running the asylum.
Has it not occurred to anybody in this room that while we're observing her, that maybe she's observing us?
Don't you want to come and meet everyone?
You all can welcome Group A without me.
Come on, CJ.
We've all worked so hard to finally be able to wake them up.
They'll be here any minute.
Come celebrate with us.
I'm having a hard time understanding your attitude here.
We are rebuilding the world.
I know, I saw the world fall, all of it.
I watched that, alone.
How can anyone say what humanity will be in 2,000 years?
How could we have known it would come to this?
How could we know what this time, this loss, would do to our souls?
He knew.
My soul is replenished.
I need you to have faith, CJ.
You say that the world fell but you're forgetting all of the people that Pilcher saved.
You are a part of that.
And what will you tell them?
Hmm?
Group A.
You'll cut the ribbon, you'll serve the corn bread.
Hmm?
And do you think they will be grateful that we stole them from the world they knew.
Do you think they will be able to comprehend what they lost?
- In time.
- In time.
Yes.
I had 2,000 years to let it go.
They will lose it in seconds.
Please, join us.
Group A should know what you've done for them.
I have confidence that they will appreciate the privilege of our continued survival here in Wayward Pines.
Oh, my God.
This isn't real.
Help me.
They're lying to us.
Stop.
Stop!
You can't leave me here!
Go, go, let's go.
This can't be true!
This isn't real!
Somebody please help!
Friend.
The people... in this town, here... friends.
Jason is our leader.
This is a waste of time.
Why is she cooperating?
I'm honestly just curious.
Given the way that we've treated them, why would she?
She's communicating, not cooperating.
If she can comprehend even more than these simple cards, then we move forward, we try to show her that not everybody in this room is her enemy.
You should want this to work.
You should want progress.
Nobody's worked harder for our survival than I have, but we're in a war here, Doctor.
Yes.
We are.
We have to try everything.
Friends.
Doc...
Doc, I wouldn't do that.
Stop, it'll kill you.
Dr. Yedlin, I...
Aah!
Get him out of there!
Any doubt that she controls them?
This experiment ends now.
No!
Stop!
Stop!
If they can learn, let's teach 'em some consequences.
Stop, stop!
Hey, think about it... if you kill her, we all die!
Kerry.
If she does control them, is killing her a risk you want to take?
I don't have an answer yet for what will end this war, but eliminating what I believe is a crucial piece of it is not what I would advise.
Or do my words not hold any weight for you anymore?
Of course they do.
Dr. Yedlin presents new information.
Let's think about what we can do with that before we waste it.
It's a cruel joke, isn't it?
Here we are, last of our species.
Best of what's left.
We can't even climb out of our own ruin to save ourselves.
You may be Jason's replacement.
But they're ours.
I've lived for many years in Wayward Pines.
I barely remember the world as it once was.
I worked hard to forget it.
But I'm so grateful to have come so far and to have seen so much.
It's been fascinating studying Margaret with you.
But at this point we can't conclude...
Are you so indoctrinated that you can't see that the only animal in this room was Jason?
I see his weaknesses, yes.
But we are not the lesser species here.
They are not our replacement.
I won't surrender to those kinds of thoughts.
I can't.
I'm sorry.
I'm going home.
I mean the hospital.
I'm gonna take a shower and try to clear my head.
I'll be back in a couple hours, and then we're gonna s...
I don't know what we're gonna do.
CJ.
You saw them first.
The Abbies.
Yes.
With Pilcher.
What do you think?
About?
Was it a mistake, commencing construction when we did?
Did we wake up too soon?
We've stolen centuries.
But that is a moment that we can't take back.
Why discuss it now?
We'll gather later to discuss protocol.
Wayward Pines did not journey into the future to grind to a halt at this.
I'll not allow it.
I assure you.
Humanity will win.
Oh!
Margaret.
It is the year 4032.
Man's destruction of the environment has created evolutionary aberrations known as Abbies that rule the earth.
One man saw the catastrophe coming.
He created an ark for mankind and selected a chosen few to sleep for 2,000 years and defy mankind's extinction.
Surrounded by mountains and protected by an electric fence, the last of humanity left alive on Earth do their best to survive in a town called Wayward Pines.
Previously on Wayward Pines...
Use the flamethrowers.
We're all still here because of you, CJ.
They learned how to use fire, they learned that the fields were important.
You make it sound as if the Abbies had a plan.
I heard you caught one of those creatures.
It's the first female we've ever seen.
Her palm... does it have a mark?
It's like a brand.
There is something exquisite about her.
Temporal gyrus.
Hers appears to be double the size of ours.
Do you think she can understand us?
The Abbies have reentered the valley outside the fence.
Are you sure the fence is impenetrable?
The fence is secure.
- What if you're wrong?
- Then we're dead.
We're safe.
Right, Dr. Yedlin?
_
Incoming!
We've got incoming!
...all the crops are dying.
Closer to home:
As Pacific Northwest residents, they do continue to welcome North Korean refugees.
Secretary of State Curry assured reporters yesterday that anyone crossing U.S. borders had been scanned for the H1R3 virus.
Was it a mistake?
Well, I suppose no one's really sleeping.
Oh, I checked your microscope with the moldy bread.
Your penicillin spores are multiplying.
Wish we'd thought of that sooner.
You didn't think it was important to tell me about this?
- It's... it's a tribal mark.
- That took a tool.
That took a design.
That took a tribe.
Look, she got in here, and none of you've been able to figure out how.
Jason is working on that and I'm confident...
She's not here by accident.
She understands.
And we better get what she understands, or it is over.
And how would we go about doing that?
We establish a system.
Yes, no.
Teach her a pattern, a common language, or... understand hers.
Just like that?
Taught my dog to go outside in two days.
She's smarter than that.
Abby Comprehension 101.
Associating images with meaning is the basis of all language.
I suppose if-if the female brain is superior, then...
Communication should be successful.
Maybe even easier than with our own species.
Hey, I'm-I'm so sorry about what's going on with your wife.
She was such a visionary at one point, with the little garages in the backs of the houses.
Now finds her only solace in heads of hair.
But, really, my-my condolences, truly.
But d-don't worry about anything.
Jason's going to find you another mate, I'm sure.
Maybe I've already found one.
What do they eat?
Uh, pellets made from leftover rations, mostly... why?
Are you wanting to reward her?
I'm not using it to reward her.
I'm using it to teach her.
- You ready?
- Okay.
Green.
Green means yes.
Yes.
It's for you, yes.
Red.
No.
No.
Hand.
Friend.
Friend.
Friend.
She's my friend.
Friend.
Am I supposed to eat one of these, now?
If you perform well.
Crown is leader.
Leader.
- Bow to me a little bit.
- I beg your pardon?
Listen, I'm trying to show her deference.
Don't get your ego into this.
It's 'cause I'm standing up and you're...
Just bow a little bit.
Leader.
Yes.
No.
Friend.
Leader.
And if she doesn't speak English, how does this help us move forward?
It's the same as when you go to a foreign country.
You grasp concepts, body language.
Say you walk into the middle of a family argument in some random apartment in, uh, North Korea.
You don't speak the language, but you know who's in power, who's at fault, who's scared, who's amused.
We can teach her, and she can teach us.
Beverly, now, the last time we talked, you were having a hard time with your marigolds.
I'm telling you stick with it.
They keep the pests away.
Huh?
Don't you listen to Harold.
He's still mad at me from that game last week.
Harold...
I told you I played pick-up in the Army, didn't I?
And massive explosions continued to be seen for miles away, as the air assault continues with no end in sight.
Civilians and...
This is an alert...
Please proceed...
You'll be given...
Hey!
Don't move!
I don't carry fire.
What?
Your metal.
- Please.
- Where are you from?
I haven't seen anyone in a while.
Clean.
I'm CJ.
Griffin.
Where are you coming from?
West.
You don't mean Old West?
Only fragments remain.
Yes.
It used to be beautiful.
Uh, how-how are the fish?
We're lucky the water's clean.
West.
Water's potable.
Anywhere closer...
You lost someone?
Didn't everyone?
Look at that one.
Hey.
Oh...
Oh, wow!
I'll go build a fire.
Listen, I have to go alone.
Why?
I left when I did just to make it easier.
How is this easier?
We would survive together.
No!
Who's helping you?
You're here... close, cared for.
I can't.
How can you not?
!
Help me!
Take me with you!
It's my job to take care of them.
Why not me?
!
Take me!
I'm sorry.
I can't.
Why do you have the right to be safe?
!
There are so many people we couldn't save.
All I can save you from is what's coming next.
You need to rest.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
We've been at this for hours.
Even if she picks up a card, you can't tell me it's anything more than dumb luck.
She'll prove it.
Give her food.
She'll understand that's her reward.
She wants them to have it.
It's empathy.
But not toward us.
How many times has she been touched and prodded and restrained?
There are other species that would kill us on sight.
Or have no compassion for their own.
Animals who consume their offspring in the name of survival, yet... she's putting the lessers above herself.
Yeah, her lessers, who are waiting outside to kill us any chance they get.
It's the mark on her palm.
Hassler said it was a symbol of power.
She's not just some chimp that's repeating a sequence for a cookie.
She's an intelligent being, and... maybe she can help us out of this mess.
Do you really think that's true?
You better hope it's true.
Because it's not just their minds.
I saw them electrocute themselves.
I saw them sacrifice themselves so others could get in here.
And then it's just... it's math.
And they have the numbers.
And they will win.
You look tired, baby.
Eileen.
Almost time to go back to sleep.
You're getting lazy.
Hmm.
I'm about to take you.
This was always your game.
I prefer it when we garden together.
My hands in the earth.
Watching what grows.
The soil under your nails.
You wash your hands so much, your skin will crack.
But I rub them.
The lotion that smelled like honey.
Tomatoes in the summer.
They never even made it inside.
I miss the smell of summer.
What does it smell like here?
I can't tell anymore.
I'm worried about you.
I knew there was a reason why you came today.
Is it now?
When we go?
Baby, that's not my job.
I wish this wasn't your job, but it is.
You can't come with me.
Soon.
Maybe soon.
Miles to go.
When I come home, when this is over,
I always thought I would be able to find you and lay next to you.
But the ground that you were in, it's not even there anymore, is it?
That's just dirt.
That's not me.
Oh, you were lifted from that dirt, and became part of the air.
While I lay here... preserved... cheating?
It's your job to be here.
But is it right?
It's what the world is now.
It won't be the world I recognize.
I've seen bombs falling like rain.
A sky that was green with poisoned light.
There were times I wanted to call out.
But I imagined my voice spinning around the world, coming back to me with no one left to hear it.
You can make the world whatever you want.
You have that power.
I don't want to be alone.
You're not.
Where is she?
Get her out.
- Get her out.
- Hey, hey.
- Wait!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
- She has the mark!
- We know, we know she has the mark, Adam.
Then why are you keeping her here?
Look, they are gathering for her.
They are coming for her, so we need to turn her over to them right now.
We don't know that that's what they want.
We don't know what they want, but she is here for a reason.
They didn't catch her.
She was sitting on a carousel.
She chose to be here.
That brand... that brand takes months to apply.
- I have seen them do it.
- Then tell me, what is it that provokes them to attack?
That's an excellent question, Dr. Yedlin.
Tell me, w-which card should we try for that?
You're both missing the point.
Those Abbies outside, they are gathering for her.
She is their leader.
That is what the brand is for.
Fine, so maybe we should be working so she can communicate with our leader.
Our leader.
You mean Jason?
Yeah, you've been gone a long time, Adam.
You have not been privy to the changes within Wayward Pines.
You're right, I've been gone a long time, Megan, but it's what's outside of Wayward Pines
- that should concern you!
- I'm calling Jason down.
He and Kerry are on the Mountain tonight.
You need to let her go.
- I need your help with her.
- Let her go.
Listen to me.
We're on the same side.
They vastly underestimated these creatures.
Yeah, and these people.
They are too stupid or too blind to do anything about it now.
I'm trying to rectify that.
You're too late.
_
Christopher.
Sir.
Is the world ready for us to begin construction?
Yes, last I checked, the soil, the air, it's all good.
Back to preindustrial levels.
What a privilege, for us to prepare for Group A's awakening.
I can only imagine what you've seen.
The world changing like sand sifting between your fingertips.
Yes.
Are you ready?
Let us go then, Christopher James.
Others are here?
Don't move.
Oh, my God.
I saw a man once, a long time ago, when he was beginning to change.
He was only the first step.
But you were right.
They shouldn't be here now.
The mutation should have run its course.
They should all be dead by now but they're here.
It didn't attack.
Maybe it's like any animal in its natural habitat.
If we don't provoke it...
This isn't any animal, CJ.
It's mankind gone wrong.
These things stopped being human quite some time ago.
We could go back to sleep.
If you didn't plan for this, maybe we should.
We need to get back to the others.
There's work to be done.
How can we live here?
I had hoped we wouldn't have to encounter them, but they're here;
this is the new reality, so we have to drive them away from here a-and then build a fence.
Over the settlement?
This isn't a settlement.
They don't possess our intelligence.
They don't possess our sense of community.
They lost all that a long time ago.
This is our land now.
Our land again.
I did plan for this.
I hoped I wouldn't have to see it when I woke up, but don't worry.
Humanity will win.
Megan claims you're establishing some sort of communication with the female?
We need a breakthrough before they do.
How many Abbies were here an hour ago?
And look at the monitors now.
There's over a thousand now.
We know that they're gathering.
Yeah, as an army would.
We need to release her now.
- You're giving her too much credit.
- Wayward Pines.
- It was theirs first.
- We made this town.
Yeah, on the ruins of their settlement.
To save humanity.
After we basically destroyed the entire planet.
Look, how old is she?
Huh?
How old is she?
About 30?
- Right?
- Blood tests show a mature
- female, yes.
- Don't you get it?
She was there when we took it away from her.
- She was there.
- Stop humanizing her.
Territoriality is not solely a human trait.
Yeah, well, we took it back.
What's wrong with that?
It's our nature to fight.
Nothing's wrong with that.
If you don't mind fighting and losing, them taking this place back and then ripping every one of us to shreds.
You have tried everything else.
They are surrounding us.
There are more of them every minute.
The only thing we have on our side right now is science, and that is telling us that this an intelligent species.
So, if we can find a way to maybe just even...
What?
Negotiate?
Why not consider it?
You're underestimating our power here.
- Pilcher always said these things...
- He said a lot of things, and that would be fine if Wayward Pines had remained in his head.
Maybe going down this road buys us more time.
I don't need another naysayer.
I don't think you know what you need right now.
I'm as surprised as anyone to be considering this, but even Megan has been swayed, now that an actual medical professional has weighed in.
Oh, I won't stand for your condescension.

Civilians and...
This is an alert...
Please proceed...

Hey!
Don't move!
I don't carry fire.
What?
Your metal.

I haven't seen anyone in a while.
Clean.
I'm CJ.
Griffin.
Where are you coming from?
West.
You don't mean Old West?
Only fragments remain.
Yes.
It used to be beautiful.
Uh, how-how are the fish?
We're lucky the water's clean.
West.
Water's potable.
Anywhere closer...
You lost someone?
Didn't everyone?
Look at that one.
Hey.
Oh...
Oh, wow!
I'll go build a fire.
Listen, I have to go alone.
Why?
I left when I did just to make it easier.
How is this easier?
We would survive together.
No!
Who's helping you?
You're here... close, cared for.
I can't.
How can you not?
!
Help me!
Take me with you!
It's my job to take care of them.
Why not me?
!
Take me!
I'm sorry.
I can't.
Why do you have the right to be safe?
!
There are so many people we couldn't save.
All I can save you from is what's coming next.
You need to rest.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
We've been at this for hours.
Even if she picks up a card, you can't tell me it's anything more than dumb luck.
She'll prove it.
Give her food.
She'll understand that's her reward.
She wants them to have it.
It's empathy.
But not toward us.
How many times has she been touched and prodded and restrained?
There are other species that would kill us on sight.
Or have no compassion for their own.
Animals who consume their offspring in the name of survival, yet... she's putting the lessers above herself.
Yeah, her lessers, who are waiting outside to kill us any chance they get.
It's the mark on her palm.
Hassler said it was a symbol of power.
She's not just some chimp that's repeating a sequence for a cookie.
She's an intelligent being, and... maybe she can help us out of this mess.
Do you really think that's true?
You better hope it's true.
Because it's not just their minds.
I saw them electrocute themselves.
I saw them sacrifice themselves so others could get in here.
And then it's just... it's math.
And they have the numbers.
And they will win.
You look tired, baby.
Eileen.
Almost time to go back to sleep.
You're getting lazy.
Hmm.
I'm about to take you.
This was always your game.
I prefer it when we garden together.
My hands in the earth.
Watching what grows.
The soil under your nails.
You wash your hands so much, your skin will crack.
But I rub them.
The lotion that smelled like honey.
Tomatoes in the summer.
They never even made it inside.
I miss the smell of summer.
What does it smell like here?
I can't tell anymore.
I'm worried about you.
I knew there was a reason why you came today.
Is it now?
When we go?
Baby, that's not my job.
I wish this wasn't your job, but it is.
You can't come with me.
Soon.
Maybe soon.
Miles to go.
When I come home, when this is over,
I always thought I would be able to find you and lay next to you.
But the ground that you were in, it's not even there anymore, is it?
That's just dirt.
That's not me.
Oh, you were lifted from that dirt, and became part of the air.
While I lay here... preserved... cheating?
It's your job to be here.
But is it right?
It's what the world is now.
It won't be the world I recognize.
I've seen bombs falling like rain.
A sky that was green with poisoned light.
There were times I wanted to call out.
But I imagined my voice spinning around the world, coming back to me with no one left to hear it.
You can make the world whatever you want.
You have that power.
I don't want to be alone.
You're not.
Where is she?
Get her out.
- Get her out.
- Hey, hey.
- Wait!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
- She has the mark!
- We know, we know she has the mark, Adam.
Then why are you keeping her here?
Look, they are gathering for her.
They are coming for her, so we need to turn her over to them right now.
We don't know that that's what they want.
We don't know what they want, but she is here for a reason.
They didn't catch her.
She was sitting on a carousel.
She chose to be here.
That brand... that brand takes months to apply.
- I have seen them do it.
- Then tell me, what is it that provokes them to attack?
That's an excellent question, Dr. Yedlin.
Tell me, w-which card should we try for that?
You're both missing the point.
Those Abbies outside, they are gathering for her.
She is their leader.
That is what the brand is for.
Fine, so maybe we should be working so she can communicate with our leader.
Our leader.
You mean Jason?
Yeah, you've been gone a long time, Adam.
You have not been privy to the changes within Wayward Pines.
You're right, I've been gone a long time, Megan, but it's what's outside of Wayward Pines
- that should concern you!
- I'm calling Jason down.
He and Kerry are on the Mountain tonight.
You need to let her go.
- I need your help with her.
- Let her go.
Listen to me.
We're on the same side.
They vastly underestimated these creatures.
Yeah, and these people.
They are too stupid or too blind to do anything about it now.
I'm trying to rectify that.
You're too late.

Christopher.
Sir.
Is the world ready for us to begin construction?
Yes, last I checked, the soil, the air, it's all good.
Back to preindustrial levels.
What a privilege, for us to prepare for Group A's awakening.
I can only imagine what you've seen.
The world changing like sand sifting between your fingertips.
Yes.
Are you ready?
Let us go then, Christopher James.
Others are here?
Don't move.
Oh, my God.
I saw a man once, a long time ago, when he was beginning to change.
He was only the first step.
But you were right.
They shouldn't be here now.
The mutation should have run its course.
They should all be dead by now but they're here.
It didn't attack.
Maybe it's like any animal in its natural habitat.
If we don't provoke it...
This isn't any animal, CJ.
It's mankind gone wrong.
These things stopped being human quite some time ago.
We could go back to sleep.
If you didn't plan for this, maybe we should.
We need to get back to the others.
There's work to be done.
How can we live here?
I had hoped we wouldn't have to encounter them, but they're here;
this is the new reality, so we have to drive them away from here a-and then build a fence.
Over the settlement?
This isn't a settlement.
They don't possess our intelligence.
They don't possess our sense of community.
They lost all that a long time ago.
This is our land now.
Our land again.
I did plan for this.
I hoped I wouldn't have to see it when I woke up, but don't worry.
Humanity will win.
Megan claims you're establishing some sort of communication with the female?
We need a breakthrough before they do.
How many Abbies were here an hour ago?
And look at the monitors now.
There's over a thousand now.
We know that they're gathering.
Yeah, as an army would.
We need to release her now.
- You're giving her too much credit.
- Wayward Pines.
- It was theirs first.
- We made this town.
Yeah, on the ruins of their settlement.
To save humanity.
After we basically destroyed the entire planet.
Look, how old is she?
Huh?
How old is she?
About 30?
- Right?
- Blood tests show a mature
- female, yes.
- Don't you get it?
She was there when we took it away from her.
- She was there.
- Stop humanizing her.
Territoriality is not solely a human trait.
Yeah, well, we took it back.
What's wrong with that?
It's our nature to fight.
Nothing's wrong with that.
If you don't mind fighting and losing, them taking this place back and then ripping every one of us to shreds.
You have tried everything else.
They are surrounding us.
There are more of them every minute.
The only thing we have on our side right now is science, and that is telling us that this an intelligent species.
So, if we can find a way to maybe just even...
What?
Negotiate?
Why not consider it?
You're underestimating our power here.
- Pilcher always said these things...
- He said a lot of things, and that would be fine if Wayward Pines had remained in his head.
Maybe going down this road buys us more time.
I don't need another naysayer.
I don't think you know what you need right now.
I'm as surprised as anyone to be considering this, but even Megan has been swayed, now that an actual medical professional has weighed in.
Oh, I won't stand for your condescension.
I'm merely stating a fact.
You weren't even awake when we built this town.
I schooled you at the Academy and I've got no problem doing it now.
No, I never denied that you had a good head on your shoulders, but, technically, you were supposed to be contributing much more to the future of Wayward Pines.
- Are you kidding me?
- Fertility and survival go hand in hand here.
Kerry knows how important the program is.
- How could this be a priority...
- It is priority.
This really is the inmates running the asylum.
Has it not occurred to anybody in this room that while we're observing her, that maybe she's observing us?
Don't you want to come and meet everyone?
You all can welcome Group A without me.
Come on, CJ.
We've all worked so hard to finally be able to wake them up.
They'll be here any minute.
Come celebrate with us.
I'm having a hard time understanding your attitude here.
We are rebuilding the world.
I know, I saw the world fall, all of it.
I watched that, alone.
How can anyone say what humanity will be in 2,000 years?
How could we have known it would come to this?
How could we know what this time, this loss, would do to our souls?
He knew.
My soul is replenished.
I need you to have faith, CJ.
You say that the world fell but you're forgetting all of the people that Pilcher saved.
You are a part of that.
And what will you tell them?
Hmm?
Group A.
You'll cut the ribbon, you'll serve the corn bread.
Hmm?
And do you think they will be grateful that we stole them from the world they knew.
Do you think they will be able to comprehend what they lost?
- In time.
- In time.
Yes.
I had 2,000 years to let it go.
They will lose it in seconds.
Please, join us.
Group A should know what you've done for them.
I have confidence that they will appreciate the privilege of our continued survival here in Wayward Pines.
Oh, my God.
This isn't real.
Help me.
They're lying to us.
Stop.
Stop!
You can't leave me here!
Go, go, let's go.
This can't be true!
This isn't real!
Somebody please help!
Friend.
The people... in this town, here... friends.
Jason is our leader.
This is a waste of time.
Why is she cooperating?
I'm honestly just curious.
Given the way that we've treated them, why would she?
She's communicating, not cooperating.
If she can comprehend even more than these simple cards, then we move forward, we try to show her that not everybody in this room is her enemy.
You should want this to work.
You should want progress.
Nobody's worked harder for our survival than I have, but we're in a war here, Doctor.
Yes.
We are.
We have to try everything.
Friends.
Doc...
Doc, I wouldn't do that.
Stop, it'll kill you.
Dr. Yedlin, I...
Aah!
Get him out of there!
Any doubt that she controls them?
This experiment ends now.
No!
Stop!
Stop!
If they can learn, let's teach 'em some consequences.
Stop, stop!
Hey, think about it... if you kill her, we all die!
Kerry.
If she does control them, is killing her a risk you want to take?
I don't have an answer yet for what will end this war, but eliminating what I believe is a crucial piece of it is not what I would advise.
Or do my words not hold any weight for you anymore?
Of course they do.
Dr. Yedlin presents new information.
Let's think about what we can do with that before we waste it.
It's a cruel joke, isn't it?
Here we are, last of our species.
Best of what's left.
We can't even climb out of our own ruin to save ourselves.
You may be Jason's replacement.
But they're ours.
I've lived for many years in Wayward Pines.
I barely remember the world as it once was.
I worked hard to forget it.
But I'm so grateful to have come so far and to have seen so much.
It's been fascinating studying Margaret with you.
But at this point we can't conclude...
Are you so indoctrinated that you can't see that the only animal in this room was Jason?
I see his weaknesses, yes.
But we are not the lesser species here.
They are not our replacement.
I won't surrender to those kinds of thoughts.
I can't.
I'm sorry.
I'm going home.
I mean the hospital.
I'm gonna take a shower and try to clear my head.
I'll be back in a couple hours, and then we're gonna s...
I don't know what we're gonna do.
CJ.
You saw them first.
The Abbies.
Yes.
With Pilcher.
What do you think?
About?
Was it a mistake, commencing construction when we did?
Did we wake up too soon?
We've stolen centuries.
But that is a moment that we can't take back.
Why discuss it now?
We'll gather later to discuss protocol.
Wayward Pines did not journey into the future to grind to a halt at this.
I'll not allow it.
I assure you.
Humanity will win.
Oh!
Margaret.
MEGAN:
It is the year 4032.
Man's destruction of the environment has created evolutionary aberrations known as Abbies... (screeching) ...that rule the earth.
(pants, screams)
One man saw the catastrophe coming.
He created an ark for mankind and selected a chosen few to sleep for 2,000 years and defy mankind's extinction.
Surrounded by mountains and protected by an electric fence, the last of humanity left alive on Earth do their best to survive in a town called Wayward Pines.
Previously on Wayward Pines... (growling)
(grunts)
Use the flamethrowers.
(shrieking)
We're all still here because of you, CJ.
They learned how to use fire, they learned that the fields were important.
You make it sound as if the Abbies had a plan.
I heard you caught one of those creatures.
KERRY:
It's the first female we've ever seen.
Her palm... does it have a mark?
It's like a brand.
MEGAN:
There is something exquisite about her.
THEO:
Temporal gyrus.
Hers appears to be double the size of ours.
Do you think she can understand us?
The Abbies have reentered the valley
- outside the fence.
- (roaring)
JASON:
Are you sure the fence is impenetrable?
The fence is secure.
- What if you're wrong?
- Then we're dead.
(shrieking)
We're safe.

- That took a tool.
That took a design.
That took a tribe.
Look, she got in here, and none of you've been able to figure out how.
Jason is working on that and I'm confident...
She's not here by accident.
She understands.
And we better get what she understands, or it is over.
And how would we go about doing that?
We establish a system.
Yes, no.
Teach her a pattern, a common language, or... understand hers.
Just like that?
Taught my dog to go outside in two days.
She's smarter than that.
Abby Comprehension 101.
Associating images with meaning is the basis of all language.

Communication should be successful.
Maybe even easier than with our own species.
Hey, I'm-I'm so sorry about what's going on with your wife.

Now finds her only solace in heads of hair.
But, really, my-my condolences, truly.

Yeah, on the ruins of their settlement.

To save humanity.
After we basically destroyed the entire planet.

Huh?

Stop humanizing her.
Territoriality is not solely a human trait.
Yeah, well, we took it back.
What's wrong with that?
It's our nature to fight.
Nothing's wrong with that.
If you don't mind fighting and losing, them taking this place back and then ripping every one of us to shreds.
You have tried everything else.
They are surrounding us.
There are more of them every minute.
The only thing we have on our side right now is science, and that is telling us that this an intelligent species.
So, if we can find a way to maybe just even...
What?
Negotiate?
Why not consider it?
You're underestimating our power here.
- Pilcher always said these things...
- He said a lot of things, and that would be fine if Wayward Pines had remained in his head.
Maybe going down this road buys us more time.
I don't need another naysayer.
I don't think you know what you need right now.
I'm as surprised as anyone to be considering this, but even Megan has been swayed, now that an actual medical professional has weighed in.
Oh, I won't stand for your condescension.
I'm merely stating a fact.
You weren't even awake when we built this town.
I schooled you at the Academy and I've got no problem doing it now.
No, I never denied that you had a good head on your shoulders, but, technically, you were supposed to be contributing much more to the future of Wayward Pines.
- Are you kidding me?
- Fertility and survival go hand in hand here.
Kerry knows how important the program is.
- How could this be a priority...

This really is the inmates running the asylum.
Has it not occurred to anybody in this room that while we're observing her, that maybe she's observing us?
Don't you want to come and meet everyone?
You all can welcome Group A without me.
Come on, CJ.
We've all worked so hard to finally be able to wake them up.
They'll be here any minute.
Come celebrate with us.
I'm having a hard time understanding your attitude here.
We are rebuilding the world.
I know, I saw the world fall, all of it.
I watched that, alone.
How can anyone say what humanity will be in 2,000 years?
How could we have known it would come to this?
How could we know what this time, this loss, would do to our souls?
He knew.
My soul is replenished.
I need you to have faith, CJ.
You say that the world fell but you're forgetting all of the people that Pilcher saved.
You are a part of that.
And what will you tell them?
Hmm?
Group A.
You'll cut the ribbon, you'll serve the corn bread.
Hmm?
And do you think they will be grateful that we stole them from the world they knew.
Do you think they will be able to comprehend what they lost?
- In time.
- In time.
Yes.
I had 2,000 years to let it go.
They will lose it in seconds.
Please, join us.
Group A should know what you've done for them.
I have confidence that they will appreciate the privilege of our continued survival here in Wayward Pines.

Given the way that we've treated them, why would she?
She's communicating, not cooperating.
If she can comprehend even more than these simple cards, then we move forward, we try to show her that not everybody in this room is her enemy.
You should want this to work.
You should want progress.

Or do my words not hold any weight for you anymore?
Of course they do.
Dr. Yedlin presents new information.
Let's think about what we can do with that before we waste it.
(snarls)
It's a cruel joke, isn't it?
Here we are, last of our species.
Best of what's left.
We can't even climb out of our own ruin to save ourselves.
You may be Jason's replacement.
But they're ours.
I've lived for many years in Wayward Pines.
I barely remember the world as it once was.
I worked hard to forget it.
But I'm so grateful to have come so far and to have seen so much.
It's been fascinating studying Margaret with you.
But at this point we can't conclude...
Are you so indoctrinated that you can't see that the only animal in this room was Jason?
I see his weaknesses, yes.
But we are not the lesser species here.
They are not our replacement.
I won't surrender to those kinds of thoughts.
I can't.
I'm sorry.
(short chuckle)
I'm going home.
I mean the hospital.
I'm gonna take a shower and try to clear my head.
I'll be back in a couple hours, and then we're gonna s...
I don't know what we're gonna do.
KERRY:
CJ.
You saw them first.
The Abbies.
Yes.
With Pilcher.
What do you think?
About?
Was it a mistake, commencing construction when we did?
Did we wake up too soon?
We've stolen centuries.
But that is a moment that we can't take back.
Why discuss it now?
We'll gather later to discuss protocol.
Wayward Pines did not journey into the future to grind to a halt at this.
I'll not allow it.
I assure you.
Humanity will win.
(gasps)
Oh!

MEGAN:
It is the year 4032.
Man's destruction of the environment has created evolutionary aberrations known as Abbies... (screeching) ...that rule the earth.
(pants, screams)
One man saw the catastrophe coming.
He created an ark for mankind and selected a chosen few to sleep for 2,000 years and defy mankind's extinction.
Surrounded by mountains and protected by an electric fence, the last of humanity left alive on Earth do their best to survive in a town called Wayward Pines.
Previously on Wayward Pines... (growling)
(grunts)
Use the flamethrowers.
(shrieking)
We're all still here because of you, CJ.
They learned how to use fire, they learned that the fields were important.
You make it sound as if the Abbies had a plan.
I heard you caught one of those creatures.
KERRY:
It's the first female we've ever seen.
Her palm... does it have a mark?
It's like a brand.
MEGAN:
There is something exquisite about her.
THEO:
Temporal gyrus.
Hers appears to be double the size of ours.
Do you think she can understand us?
The Abbies have reentered the valley
- outside the fence.
- (roaring)
JASON:
Are you sure the fence is impenetrable?
The fence is secure.
- What if you're wrong?
- Then we're dead.
(shrieking)
We're safe.
Right, Dr. Yedlin?

Look, she got in here, and none of you've been able to figure out how.
Jason is working on that and I'm confident...
She's not here by accident.
She understands.
And we better get what she understands, or it is over.
And how would we go about doing that?
We establish a system.
Yes, no.
Teach her a pattern, a common language, or... understand hers.
Just like that?
Taught my dog to go outside in two days.
She's smarter than that.
Abby Comprehension 101.
Associating images with meaning is the basis of all language.
I suppose if-if the female brain is superior, then...
Communication should be successful.
Maybe even easier than with our own species.
Hey, I'm-I'm so sorry about what's going on with your wife.
She was such a visionary at one point, with the little garages in the backs of the houses.
Now finds her only solace in heads of hair.
But, really, my-my condolences, truly.

There are other species that would kill us on sight.
Or have no compassion for their own.

Yeah, her lessers, who are waiting outside to kill us any chance they get.
It's the mark on her palm.
Hassler said it was a symbol of power.
She's not just some chimp that's repeating a sequence for a cookie.
She's an intelligent being, and... maybe she can help us out of this mess.

You better hope it's true.

We don't know what they want, but she is here for a reason.
They didn't catch her.
She was sitting on a carousel.
She chose to be here.
That brand... that brand takes months to apply.

- Then tell me, what is it that provokes them to attack?
That's an excellent question, Dr. Yedlin.
Tell me, w-which card should we try for that?
You're both missing the point.
Those Abbies outside, they are gathering for her.
She is their leader.
That is what the brand is for.
Fine, so maybe we should be working so she can communicate with our leader.

Yeah, you've been gone a long time, Adam.
You have not been privy to the changes within Wayward Pines.

that rule the Earth.
One man saw the catastrophe coming.
He created an ark for mankind and selected a chosen few to sleep for 2,000 years and defy mankind's extinction.
Surrounded by mountains and protected by an electric fence, the last of humanity left alive on Earth, do their best to survive in a town called Wayward Pines.
[narrator] Previously an Wayward Pines... [snarling] [gunfire]
Use the flame throwers.
[Jason] We're all still here, because of you, CJ.
They learned how to use fire.
They learned that the fields were important.
You make it sound as if the Abbies had a plan.
I heard you caught one of those creatures.
[Kerry] It's the first female we've ever seen.
Her palm, does it have a mark?
It's like a brand.
There is something exquisite about her.
[Theo] Temporal gyrus.
Hers appears to be double the size of ours.
Do you think she can understand us?
The Abbies have reentered the valley outside the fence.
[growling]
Are you sure the fence is impenetrable?
The fence is secure.
- What if you're wrong?
- Then we're dead.
[Arlene] We're safe, right, Dr. Yedlin?
[classical music playing]
[man over radio] Incoming, we got incoming.
We can't contain them!
[woman] All the craps are dying.
Closer to home, at Pacific Northwest residence, they do continue to welcome North Korean refugees.
Secretary of State, Curry, assured reporters yesterday that anyone crossing US borders had been scanned for the H1R3 virus.
[beeping]
Was it a mistake?
[theme music playing]
[growling] [growling]
[snarls]
Well, I suppose no one's really sleeping.
Oh, I checked your microscope with moldy bread, your penicillin spores are multiplying.
Wish we'd thought of that sooner.
You didn't think it was important to tell me about this?
It's... it's a tribal mark.
That took a tool, that took a design, that took a tribe.
Look, she got in here, and none of you've been able to figure out how.
Jason is working on that and I'm confident--
She's not here by accident.
She understands.
And we better get what she understands, or it is over.
And how would we go about doing that?
We establish a system.
Yes, no.
Teach her a pattern, a common language, or understand hers.
Just like that.
Taught my dog to go outside in two days.
She's smarter than that.
Abby Comprehension 101.
Associating images with meaning is the basis of all language.
I suppose if the female brain is superior, then--
Communication should be successful.
Maybe even easier than with our own species.
Hey, I'm so sorry about what's goin' on with your wife.
She was such a visionary at one point, with the little garages in the backs of the houses.
Now finds her only solace in heads of hair.
But, really, my condolences.
Truly.
But don't worry about anything.
Jason's gonna find you another mate, I'm sure.
Maybe I've already found one.
What do they eat?
Pellets made from leftover rations mostly.
Why?
Are you wanting to reward her?
I'm not using it to reward her, I'm using it to teach her.
- Ready?
- Okay.
Green.
Green means yes.
Yes.
It's for you.
Yes.
Red.
No.
No.
Hand.
Friend.
Friend.
Friend.
She is my friend.
Friend.
Am I supposed to eat one of these now?
If you perform well.
Crown... is leader.
Leader.
- Bow to me a little bit.
- I beg your pardon!
Listen, I'm just trying to show her deference.
Don't get your ego into this.
It's 'cause I'm standing up and you--
Bow a little bit.
Leader.
Yes.
No.
Friend.
Leader.
And if she doesn't speak English, how does this help us move forward?
It's the same as when you go to a foreign country.
You grasp concepts, body language.
Say you walk into the middle of a family argument in some random apartment in North Korea.
You don't speak the language but you know who's in power, who's at fault, who's scared, who's amused.
We can teach her, and she can teach us.
[beeping]
Beverly, now the last time we talked, you were having a hard time with your marigolds.
I'm telling you, stick with it.
They keep the pests away.
[chuckles]
Don't you listen to Harold.
He's still mad at me from that game last week.
Harold.
I told you I played pick up in the army, didn't I?
[newscaster] And massive explosions continue to be seen from miles away, as the air assault continues with no end in sight, civilians-- [announcer] This is an alert-- [static crackling]
Please proceed--
You'll be given--
[man] Hey!
Don't move!
- I don't carry fire.
- What?
Your metal.
- Please.
- Where you from?
I haven't seen anyone in a while.
Clean.
I'm CJ.
Griffin.
Where are you coming from?
West.
You don't mean Old West?
- Only fragments remain.
- Yes.
It used to be beautiful.
[stuttering] How are the fish?
We're lucky the water's clean.
West.
Water's potable.
Anywhere closer.
You lost someone?
Didn't everyone?
Look, I got one.
Hey.
Oh.
Oh, wow.
[grunting]
I'll go build a fire.
[moaning]
[moaning continues]
[Griffin panting]
- Listen, I have to go alone.
- Why?
I left when I did just to make it easier.
How is this easier?
- We would survive together.
- No!
Who's helping you?
You're here, close, cared for.
- I can't.
- How can you not?
Help me!
Take me with you.
- It's my job to take care of them.
- Why not me?
Take me!
I'm sorry.
I can't.
Why do you have the right to be safe?
[grunting] [snap]
There are so many people we couldn't save.
All I can save you from is what's coming next.
You need to rest.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
We've been at this for hours.
Even if she picks up a card, you can't tell me it's anything more than dumb luck.
She'll prove it.
Give her food, she'll understand that's her reward.
[grunting] [growling]
She wants them to have it.
- It's empathy.
- But not toward us.
How many times has she been touched and prodded and restrained?
There are other species that would kill us on sight, or have no compassion for their own.
Animals who consume their offspring in the name of survival, yet... she's putting the lessers above herself.
Yeah.
Her lessers who are waiting outside to kill us any chance they get.
It's the mark on her palm.
Hassler said it was a symbol of power.
She's not just some chimp that's repeating a sequence for a cookie.
She's an intelligent being and... maybe she can help us out of this mess.
You really think that's true?
You better hope it's true.
Because it's not just their minds.
I saw them electrocute themselves.
I saw them sacrifice themselves, so others could get in here.
And then it's just-
- It's math.
And they have the numbers.
And they will win.
[radio static]
You look tired, baby.
Eileen.
Almost time to go back to sleep.
You're getting lazy.
I'm about to take you.
This was always your game.
I preferred when we gardened together.
My hands in the Earth.
Watching what grows.
The soil under your nails.
You washed your hands so much your skin would crack.
But I rub them.
In the lotion that smelled like honey.
Tomatoes in the summer.
They never even made it inside.
[Eileen chuckles]
I miss the smell of summer.
What does it smell like here?
I can't tell any more.
I'm worried about you.
I knew there was a reason why you came today.
Is it now when we go?
[laughing]
Baby, that's not my job.
I wish this wasn't your job, but it is.
You can't come with me.
Soon.
Maybe soon.
Miles to go.
When I come home, when this is over,
I always thought I would be able to find you... and lay next to you.
But the ground that you were in, it's not even there any more, is it?
There's just dirt.
That's not me.
Oh, you were lifted from that dirt and became part of the air, while I lay here... preserved, cheating.
It's your job to be here.
But is it right?
It's what the world is now.
It won't be the world I recognize.
I've seen bombs falling like rain.
A sky that was green with poisoned light.
There were times I wanted to call out.
But I imagined my voice spinning around the world, coming back to me with no one left to hear it.
You can make the world whatever you want.
You have that power.
I don't want to be alone.
You're not.
[snarling]
Where is she?
- Get her out.
Get her out!
- Hey, hey.
Let her out!
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[Adam] She has the mark!
We know, we know, she has the mark, Adam.
Then why are you keeping her here?
Look, they are gathering for her.
They are coming for her, so we need to turn her over to them right now.
We don't know that that's what they want.
We don't know what they want, but she is here for a reason.
They didn't catch her.
She was sitting on a carousel.
She chose to be here.
That brand, that brand takes months to apply.
- I have seen them do it.
- Then tell me.
What is it that provokes them to attack?
That's an excellent question, Dr. Yedlin.
Tell me, which card should we try for that?
You're both missing the point.
Those Abbies outside, they are gathering for her.
She is their leader.
That is what the brand is for.
Fine, so maybe we should be working so she can communicate with our leader.
Our leader?
You mean, Jason?
Yeah, you've been gone a long time, Adam.
You have not been privy to the changes within Wayward Pines.
You're right, I've been gone a long time, Megan, but it's what's outside of Wayward Pines that should concern you.
I'm calling Jason down.
He and Kerry are on the mountain tonight.
You need to let her go.
- I need your help.
- We've got to let her go.
Listen to me.
We're on the same side.
They vastly underestimated these creatures.
Yeah, and these people, they are too stupid or too blind to do anything about it now.
I'm trying to rectify that.
You're too late.
[mechanical whirring]
Christopher.
Sir.
Is the world ready for us to begin construction?
Yes, last I checked, the soil, the air, it's all good.
Back to pre-industrial levels.
What a privilege for us to prepare for Group A's awakening.
I can only imagine what you've seen.
The world changing, like sand sifting between your fingertips.
Yes.
Are you ready?
Let us go then,
Christopher James.
[mild chuckle] [birds chirping]
Those are here?
Don't move.
Oh, my God.
I saw a man once, a long time ago, when he was beginning to change.
He was only the first step.
- But you were right.
- They shouldn't be here now.
Mutation should've run its course.
They should all be dead by now.
But they're here?
It didn't attack.
Maybe it's like any animal in its natural habitat, if we don't provoke it--
This isn't any animal, CJ.
It's mankind gone wrong.
These things stopped being human quite some time ago.
We could go back to sleep.
If you didn't plan for this, maybe we should.
We need to get back to the others.
There's work to be done.
How can we live here?
I had hoped that we wouldn't have to encounter them, but they're here, this is the new reality, so, we have to drive them away from here and build a fence.
Over the settlement?
This isn't a settlement.
They don't possess our intelligence.
They don't possess our sense of community.
They lost all that a long time ago.
This is our land now.
Our land again.
I did plan for this.
I hoped I wouldn't have to see it when I woke up, but... don't worry, humanity will win.
[door opens] [growling]
[Kerry] Megan claims you're establishing some sort of communication with the female?
We need a breakthrough before they do.
How many Abbies were here an hour ago?
And look at the monitors now.
There's over a thousand now.
- We know that they're gathering.
- Yeah, as an army would.
We need to release her now!
You're giving her too much credit.
- Wayward Pines, it was theirs first.
- We made this town.
Yeah, on the ruins of their settlement.
To save humanity.
After we basically destroyed the entire planet.
Look, how old is she?
How old is she, about thirty, right?
Blood tests show a mature female, yes.
Don't you get it?
She was there, when we took it away from her.
[Adam] She was there.
[Jason] Stop humanizing her.
Territoriality is not solely a human trait.
Yeah, well, we took it back.
What's wrong with that?
It's our nature to fight.
Nothing is wrong with that.
If you don't mind fighting and losing, them taking this place back and then ripping every one of us to shreds.
You have tried everything else.
They are surrounding us.
There are more of them every minute.
The only thing we have on our side right now is science, and that is telling us that this is an intelligent species.
So if we can find a way to make just even--
What?
Negotiate?
Why not consider it?
You're underestimating our power here.
Pilcher always said these things--
He said a lot of things, and that would be fine if Wayward Pines had remained in his head.
Maybe going down this road buys us more time.
I don't need another naysayer.
I don't think you know what you need right now.
I'm as surprised as anyone to be considering this, but even Megan has been swayed, now that an actual medical professional has weighed in.
Oh, I won't stand for your condescension.
I'm merely stating a fact.
You weren't even awake when we built this town.
I schooled you at the academy and I have got no problem doing it now.
Now I never denied that you had a good head on your shoulders, but, technically, you were supposed to be contributing much more
-to the future of Wayward Pines.
- Are you kidding me?
Fertility and survival go hand in hand here.
Kerry knows how important the program is.
- How could this be a priority--
- It is priority.
This really is the inmates running the asylum.
Has it not occurred to anybody in this room, that while we're observing her, that maybe she's observing us?
Don't you wanna come and meet everyone?
You all can welcome Group A without me.
Come on, CJ.
We've all worked so hard to finally be able to wake them up.
They'll be here any minute.
Come celebrate with us.
I'm having a hard time understanding your attitude here.
We are rebuilding the world.
I know, I saw the world fall, all of it.
I watched it, alone.
How can anyone say what humanity will be in 2000 years?
How could we have known it would come to this?
How could we know what this time, this loss, would do to our souls?
He knew.
My soul is replenished.
I need you to have faith, CJ.
You say that the world fell, but you're forgetting all of the people that Pilcher saved.
You are a part of that.
And what would you tell them, hmm?
Group A, you'll cut the ribbon, you'll serve the cornbread?
And do you think they will be grateful that we stole them from the world they knew?
Do you think they'll be able to comprehend what they lost?
- In time.
- In time.
Yes.
I had 2,000 years to let it go.
They will lose it in seconds.
Please join us.
Group A should know what you've done for them.
I have confidence that they will appreciate the privilege of our continued survival here in Wayward Pines.
[carousel music]
[shrieking in distance] [man] Oh, my God, this isn't real.
[man] Help me!
[man] They lied to us!
Stop!
Stop!
You can't leave me here.
[horns blaring] [indistinct chatter]
[woman] This can't be true!
This isn't real!
Friend.
The people... in this town here,
friends.
Jason is our leader.
This is a waste of time.
Why is she cooperating?
I'm honestly just curious.
Given the way we've treated them, why would she?
She's communicating, not cooperating.
If she can comprehend even more than these simple cards, then we move forward.
We try to show her that not everybody in this room is her enemy.
You should want this to work.
You should want progress.
Nobody's worked harder for our survival than I have, but we're in a war here, doctor.
Yes, we are.
We have to try everything.
Friends.
Doc.
[growls]
[Jason] Doc, I wouldn't do that.
[Kerry] Stop, it'll kill you.
Dr. Yedlin, I--
[growling]
[Kerry] Get him out of there!
[intense growl]
Any doubt that she controls them?
This experiment ends now.
[gunshot]
No!
[growling] [gunshot]
Stop!
Stop!
If they can learn?
Let's teach them some consequences.
[gunshot]
Stop!
Stop!
Hey!
Think about it.
If you kill her, we all die!
Kerry.
If she does control them, is killing her a risk you wanna take?
I don't have an answer yet for what will end this war, but eliminating what I believe is a crucial piece of it, is not what I would advise.
Or do my words not hold any weight for you any more?
Of course, they do.
Dr. Yedlin presents new information.
Let's think about what we can do with that before we waste it.
[snarls]
It's a cruel joke, isn't it?
Here we are, last of our species.
Best of what's left.
We can't even climb out of our own ruins to save ourselves.
You may be Jason's replacement, but they're ours.
I've lived for many years in Wayward Pines.
I barely remember the world as it once was.
I worked hard... to forget it.
I'm so grateful... to have come so far, and to have seen so much.
It's been fascinating, studying Margaret with you.
But at this point, we can't conclude--
Are you so indoctrinated that you can't see that the only animal in this room was Jason.
I see his weaknesses, yes.
But we are not the lesser species here.
They are not our replacement.
I won't surrender to those kinds of thoughts.
I can't.
I'm sorry.
I'm going home.
[mild chuckle]
I mean, the hospital.
I'm gonna take a shower and try to clear my head.
I'll be back in a couple of hours and then we're gonna...
I don't know what we're gonna do.
CJ, you saw them first.
The Abbies.
Yes, with Pilcher.
What do you think?
About?
Was it a mistake?
Commencing construction when we did.
Did we wake up too soon?
We've stolen centuries.
But that is a moment that we can't take back.
Why discuss it now?
We'll gather later to discuss protocol.
Wayward Pines did not journey into the future to grind to a halt at this.
I'll not allow it.
I assure you.
Humanity will win.
[gasps] [dramatic music playing]
[Exclaims]
Margaret.
We have shots fired, 402 River Street.
Get the exits, exits, exits.
Let's go, go, go, go.
Let's go.
[tires screeching] [siren chirps] [dramatic music]
Remind me why we came in here.
'Cause you're a glory hound.
Even I remember coming in alone was your idea.
All right, two guards have already been shot.
Any ideas how to stop this guy before this turns into a bloodbath?
No, not really.
[gunshot] [grunts] Guess we found him.
All right, cover me.
I'm heading upstairs.
Yeah, there you go, stealing my glory again.
Be careful.
[gunshots]
[gunshots]
[gunshots]
Turn around and drop your weapon!
Now!
♪ ♪
Six in a row.
What?
Way to go.
- Both:
Yeah!
- Yes!
Six in a row!
Way to go!
No...
Oh, my... [dramatic music]
Great work taking down that shooter, boss.
Two security guards he shot are gonna pull through.
We got lucky.
No, we got Carrie Wells on our side.
How's she doing, by the way?
Let's all keep an eye on her today.
- Absolutely.
- Of course.
All right, we need to figure out what just happened here...
An act of terrorism, disgruntled former employee, someone making a political statement?
What do we know about this guy?
[keys clicking]
Eli Condon, 45, worked as columnist in a small newspaper out in Westchester, married, three kids.
According to the coworkers I talked with, he's the nicest guy in the office.
They're all totally shocked.
They sense anything off with him recently, problems at home, at work?
No, there's nothing like that.
The guy has a clean record.
He doesn't even have a parking ticket.
Why the old power plant?
Been shut down for six months.
Anyone in his family work there or for that company?
There's nothing linking him to the power plant.
I can't even find any evidence that Condon set foot on Roosevelt Island before today.
All right, well, then what the hell was he doing there?
History of mental illness, suffering from PTSD?
Guy shoots a gun like that, he must have military experience, right?
He's got a clean bill of health.
Guy's got no service record.
It's looking like Eli Condon's a totally normal guy.
No, totally normal guys don't go on shooting rampages.
Something set Condon off.
Keep digging into him.
Yeah, you got it.
Jay, work up a timeline of Condon's movements leading up to the shooting.
We need to know if he was a lone wolf or if others were involved.
Hey, Delina, I need to see the body.
Hey.
Thought you were ordered to take the day off to meet with psych services.
Yeah, well, you know how I feel about psych services.
Take a look.
[sighs]
Something bothering you?
Ever since I saw him today,
I keep getting this feeling that I've met him before, but I know I haven't.
Six in a row!
[screaming]
Carrie, what is it?
Nothing.
Can you talk to me about the autopsy?
Did you find anything unusual, out of the ordinary?
A small puncture on his shoulder.
Could have been from a needle.
Lab tests will tell me if there was anything in his system.
Okay.
Thanks.
Listen, I...
I haven't thought about... this carnival in years.
And then I see Eli at the power plant, and suddenly it's popping into my head over and over, and I don't know why except that I feel like there's some kind of connection between Eli and the carnival.
I just...
I don't know what it is.
All right, relax.
Put yourself back at that carnival, all right?
If Eli Condon is there, we'll find him together.
We've done this before.
Focus and just tell me what you see.
[cheers and applause]
Here we go.
Come on, Carrie, you got this.
Come on, come on.
Come on, come on.
I'm throwing balls at the milk bottle toss.
- Whoo!
- Yes, yes!
I won six times.
Six in a row.
Way to go!
[chuckling]
- Whoo!
- Yes, Carrie, yes!
The guys from the task force are there with me.
Do you see Eli Condon anywhere?
Where are you, Eli?
What?
What is it?
I was at the carnival, but then it was gone, and then I was someplace else, someplace I've never been, but... it felt like I was re-experiencing it, like a memory, which doesn't make any sense.
Something's going on here.
You said something about a task force?
I don't want to talk about that.
I think we should.
Has anyone talked to Eli's wife?
No.
Well, let's start there.
Okay.
Your people have been here all day, tearing the place apart, treating Eli like he's some terrorist or something.
W... what am I supposed to tell my girls?
Mrs. Condon, we know this is difficult.
We're just trying to understand how your husband could behave in a way so unlike the incredible man you just told me about.
Was he upset lately?
Problems at home?
Eli never had a bad day.
He was always so cheerful and optimistic, the gentlest person I knew.
Is it possible he was hiding something from you?
We didn't keep secrets.
Eli was happy.
He adores his kids, and... we were about to celebrate our tenth anniversary with a trip to Italy.
- When?
- A few weeks.
We were supposed to go on a biking tour.
Eli's been training every morning and night.
Just last night, I told him to cut it out after he swiped a car and nearly got killed.
How bad was the accident?
He went over the handlebars.
The helmet got the worst of it.
I forced him to go to the emergency room, and they ran some tests, but... everything checked out.
[sobs]
[dramatic chord] [man laughing] [laughing]
Eli left this morning at the normal time, 8:15, and texted from the office saying he was feeling better.
You had no idea he was going into the city?
None.
He didn't like the city.
He felt claustrophobic... although...
What?
He went into Manhattan yesterday for a job interview.
Why would he get a job in the city if he didn't like it there?
You know what a suburban paper pays?
He was supposed to meet with a political news website,
"Metropolis Report."
Eli said he'd be a fool to turn his nose at that kind of money.
You know who he met with?
No, but they canceled at the last minute.
Excuse me, I found this in your daughter's room.
Do you know where it came from?
Lulu has a lot of toys and stuffed animals.
I...
I have no idea.
Do you think maybe your husband gave it to her?
Maybe.
He always brought her presents from his work trips.
Okay, so do you think maybe he could have gotten it at a carnival?
- A carnival upstate?
- Carrie.
I...
A carnival in Warrensburg, perhaps?
I told you, I don't know where it came from.
Well, maybe I can talk to your daughter.
- She might know.
- Carrie, enough.
Thank you for your time, Mrs. Condon.
What was that about?
Her husband shot two security guards, shot at us, okay?
He's the criminal, not the victim.
I was asking questions, which is my job.
You should try doing yours.
That woman doesn't know anything.
What was that about a stuffed animal?
I...
I don't know.
Somehow Eli is attached, connected to this carnival and these images I keep having in my head.
Look, I have complete faith in your memory, but I also know you obsess over things, and I don't want to see that happen.
How many times do I have to tell you that I don't need you to protect me,
I don't want you to protect me?
- I'm fine.
- Mm-hmm.
- Jay?
- Yup?
Any progress tracking Condon's movements today?
He did go to work like his wife said, but then he got on the Metro North at 10:55 out of Scarsdale, got into Grand Central at 11:40 a.m.
Shooting took place about an hour after he arrived.
Did you find any calls, emails prompting him to head into the city?
No, nothing.
Looks like he got here, headed straight for the power plant.
Not much to work with.
Anything on his job interview yesterday?
You mean alleged job interview, right?
- Alleged?
- No one at "Metropolis Report"
knows anything about Eli Condon.
All right, his wife said it was canceled last-minute.
Did he get any calls around the time of the interview?
His only incoming call around that time was a robo call.
So the job interview story was bogus?
What, having an affair?
Why lie to his wife, and where would he have this romantic rendezvous?
Already ahead of you, boss.
[keyboard clicking]
Looks like he got a bottle of water and some breath mints at a bodega down on East 49th Street as soon as he got into the city yesterday.
I did a facial recognition search on all the cameras in the immediate area, and we got a positive match for Eli Condon.
11:32 yesterday morning, he enters the Ardmore building.
You get him coming out too?
Exits the building at 1:45 p.m.
The building doesn't exactly scream "affair," does it?
So what was he doing in there for two hours?
I don't know, but get this.
Visitors log show no record of Eli.
There's only three names in that time period, and they're all women.
We need to know who he was visiting.
Boss, that building's got hundreds of tenants.
Get his picture to every office in that building.
Someone in there has a connection to our shooter.
[snaps fingers] You got it.
[muttering] Come on, come on.
[dinner music playing]
Valerie, right?
Yeah, we met at the ski lodge in Vermont a few years back.
- [laughs] Oh, come on.
- You still work for "Vogue"?
October 24, 2001, you read an article in "Maxim" that told you role-playing spices things up in the bedroom.
Well, things must have gotten pretty spicy that night for me to remember it so perfectly.
Except that my name was Victoria and I worked for "The Atlantic."
You had a giggling fit every time I referred to your chosen name of Chet.
And then things got so weird, you started sweating profusely and had a panic attack... game over.
How's that for spicy?
Ah, poor Chet doesn't know what he missed.
So, Eli Condon...
Jay tracked him to the Ardmore building yesterday.
We're working on who he met with.
So far we don't have a contact for Eli in the building, but the only call Eli got yesterday was from a burner cell.
It lasted eight seconds.
So we got nothing.
We keep hitting roadblocks with this.
I mean, we're not getting anywhere.
Maybe I should just... man up and talk to the people on the task force, see if they remember anything about Eli.
Maybe they knew him.
I don't know.
Now, listen, I'm in the dark here.
Talk to me.
It was 2006.
I'd left Syracuse.
I'd left you.
I wanted to leave it all behind.
I was done being a cop, but this was different...
CIA.
They recruited me because of my special abilities.
We were assigned with tracking down a rogue NSA agent and taking him out.
He was leaking classified information to the wrong people.
No one could find him, but we did.
We found him, and we killed him... and then it was over.
We disappeared back into our own lives, weren't allowed to contact each other, but that was fine with me.
I wanted nothing to do with any of them.
- Too many...
- Memories.
Right.
Okay.
Let's you and me give this one more shot before you reach out.
Okay.
I did a little research on the Warrensburg Carnival from 2006.
Figured if I tell you a few details, maybe it'll trigger something.
Okay.
So, while at this carnival, did you enjoy
John Ormsbee's award-winning "Grateful Red" chili?
[laughs]
No, although I do love a terrible pun with my chili.
I'll bet you do.
All right, do you remember Estragon, grand champion breeding heifer?
No, I don...
I don't recall a cow named Estragon.
Okay, well, those are the only two storylines coming out of the carnival that the local paper saw fit to print.
There's no mention of your softball-throwing exploits.
Well, there should have been.
I was on fire.
[screams]
Both:
Yeah!
- No.
- [gunshot echoes]
October 20, 2006 is going to send me over the edge.
I have to figure this out.
October 20, 2006?
Yes.
You know, the, uh...
Warrensburg Carnival was on May 8th that year.
No, that's impossible.
Well, it's hard to believe, but your memory's wrong.
[keyboard clicking]
Okay, Peter Roach, where are you?
[whispering] Where are you?
"Special Agent Peter Roach, killed in a training accident on January 21, 2013."
All right, Sam McQuaid.
"ATF, killed in the line of duty on February 18, 2013."
Peter and Sam died within a month of each other.
Emmet Grinwis.
Don't tell me you're dead too.
"Terminated from the FBI two years ago.
Three stays in mental institutions.
Last known address, Newburgh."
What is going on?
Brian Fenton.
- Hey.
- Hey.
What are you doing here so late?
Jay, you're just the guy I need.
"Brian Fenton, ATF.
File sealed,
Top secret clearance only."
Oh, so that's what you're doing so late at night.
You're breaking federal law.
I haven't broken any laws, at least... not yet.
No.
No way.
No, not this time, not happening.
That file says, "Stay away, Jay." No.
Something's going on here, and I need your help.
You're the only one I trust to do this.
Please.
You know what?
Just do me a favor, okay?
Promise me you're gonna say nice things at my trial after the Feds come drag me out of here, all right?
- Oh, thank you.
- Oh, okay, right.
[energetic music]
♪ ♪
Hey, look at you, in early doing paperwork like a big guy.
Yeah, I like it.
It classes you up a bit.
It's just temporary till Sandra gets back.
- We should know in a day or two.
- Yeah, that's great, but I'm just saying, being the boss suits you.
I take it you're here for some other reason than to annoy me, right?
We tracked the rifle Eli used.
It's a military prototype.
Prototype?
It's supposed to be the sniper rifle of the future.
DoD scrapped the program about five years ago.
How did Eli get his hands on it?
Weapon he used traces back to a pallet of guns stolen from Langley, 2009.
Langley, as in home of the CIA?
Get this... guns from the same pallet used in the shootings of Congressman Hill about a year ago in New Mexico and the killing of journalist Jeff Brooks in Virginia a few months before that.
The same prototype was used in three shootings?
Get me everything you can on these other cases.
All right.
[dramatic music] [keys clicking]
Hey.
Hey.
Thanks for coming by.
I tried Carrie, but I couldn't get her.
Yeah, she's seeing an old colleague.
What do you got?
So the tox results came in for Eli Condon.
Curious thing... he wasn't drunk or high in the usual sense of the word, but there were traces of dextro-lysergamide in his system.
Which is a good thing or a bad thing?
Dextro-lysergamide is part of a group of powerful antipsychotic drugs called psychotropics.
But we didn't find any history of mental illness, and Eli wasn't taking any prescribed medications.
Right, but see, the thing about psychotropics is they've been linked to mind manipulation and mental control, so it's possible that...
Mind control?
I know it sounds crazy.
I'm just telling you what I found.
All right, can you tell me when this drug was put into Eli's system?
Well, it's hard to give an exact time, but I'd say within the last 36 hours.
So right around the time Eli went into the Ardmore building.
- Thank you.
- You got it.
'Scuse me.
[suspenseful music]
Emmet?
[gun cocks]
Emmet?
I'm Carrie Wells.
You're that memory cop.
Yeah, that's right.
You want to put the gun down?
I know why you're here... to kill me.
Just like you killed Roach.
I didn't kill anybody.
Emmet...
I'm gonna put my gun away.
I just want to talk to you.
You remember that carnival we went to, all of us together?
There's something not right about that night.
I think about that carnival all the time.
You do?
It's kind of odd.
My past, the present... doesn't stick with me anymore, but that carnival is clear as day.
What... what do you remember about the carnival, Emmet?
I remember me and you and Pete, Sam...
- celebrating.
- Right.
Walking around, had a few beers.
And then I impressed you all with my arm.
What do you mean?
The milk bottles.
I knocked them over.
No, I...
I knocked them over.
Hell, no, you didn't knock them over.
You guys were cheering me on.
I couldn't have done it without you.
"Six in a row!
Way to go!"
[makes cheering sound]
Sorry.
You remembered wrong.
No.
I don't...
I don't ever remember things wrong.
Are you saying you threw all those strikes?
Yeah.
I knocked the milk bottles down.
Where are you going?
To prove your memory wrong.
If you played the game, how did I wind up with this?
[ominous music]
Hey, hey, boss, listen.
I looked into those shootings like you asked for.
Anything linking to Eli Condon?
Nothing definitive, right, but the MO's the same...
Two shooters.
Armando Lockett,
Skip Camirand.
Neither man had any criminal record, weapons training, mental illness, political activism... nothing.
Nothing pointing to a history of or capacity for violence whatsoever.
Both men... killed themselves after the shooting.
Sounds familiar.
ME reports showed some kind of weird drug in their system,
- a dextro...
- Dextro-lysergamide.
It's a mind control drug.
How do you know what?
It was in Eli's system too.
All right, come on, boss, seriously?
What, are we getting into some kind of conspiracy theory stuff here?
Killing of a political journalist, shooting a... a congressman?
All right.
Shooting up a closed power plant doesn't really track unless our shooter was just in the wrong spot?
You know what?
Put together a list of potential targets in the area of yesterday's shooting.
All right.
[tense music]
Hey, listen, I went to see Emmet, okay, one of the guys on the task force.
Now, he had a memory of the carnival too,
- except that his...
- I told you I'd go with you.
I know, I know, but listen.
He remembers everything like I do of that carnival, except that in his memory he's the one who was throwing the softball, not me.
Now, this guy is loopy.
He barely remembered who I was, but the carnival is crystal clear in his mind.
It's bizarre.
I don't know...
Something is going on here.
We found two other shootings in the last year with a similar MO to Eli's.
All three men had traces of a psychotropic in their systems.
It's possible someone manipulated these shooters.
What are you saying, mind control drug?
Hey, Carrie.
That file you wanted to read about, that guy you used to work with, Brian Fenton?
- You got in?
- Yeah.
Okay, so this guy Brian Fenton's claiming that he was in the ATF?
Bogus.
For the past 35 years, this guy's been in the scientific intelligence division of...
- Of the CIA.
- Yup, you got it.
In the early '80s he oversaw a Black Ops project called MJ Volt.
And it looks like it was a program aimed at making American soldiers immune to
Soviet interrogation techniques using mind control and memory manipulation, also known as brainwashing.
Only researchers started to believe that they could use the same techniques to gain control over unsuspecting subjects.
So agents so covert they don't even know their own involvement?
Okay, "started to believe"
is very different than actually accomplishing, okay?
Which this program never did, did they?
No, actually.
Project Volt didn't achieve anything other than losing a ton of dough.
- Got shut down in 1986.
- Exactly.
Jay, did you find anyone else associated with this Project Volt?
Would you stop trying to connect dots that don't exist?
Actually, Carrie,
I did find a list of professors and scientists linked to the project, so, yeah.
Look, I just think we should consider the possibility that someone rebooted this program and made it operational, and somehow you might be involved.
Oh, my God.
Re... there is no way someone got into my head, brainwashed me without me knowing it.
Will you please just look at the photos
- and see if you recognize anyone?
- Yes.
If this project is active, someone else might die.
You might be the one who could stop it.
I just said yes.
Show me the photos.
O... kay.
No.
Nope.
No.
No.
Stop there.
Six in a row!
Way to go!
Dr. Edward Wythe, Yale?
No, no, that guy's not a doctor.
He's a carny.
I mean, he's the guy who was working the milk bottle toss
- at the carnival.
- Are you sure?
Yes, I'm sure.
If that's true,
Wythe might be who Eli went to see at the Ardmore building.
Well, I guess there's only one way to find out, isn't there?
[tense music]
♪ ♪
Building security says a man resembling Wythe but using a different name is renting an office here in the basement.
[tense music continues]
He's not here.
Dextro-lysergamide.
If this is from today, then Wythe has activated another killer.
Hey, boss, I got a BOLO out on Wythe.
Got his picture circulating in every airport, train station, and bridge.
Great, but right now we need to focus on tracking down this possible shooter.
Oh, with no ID, no description, no potential target?
I mean, we're good, boss, but we can't find a ghost.
What about potential targets in town yesterday?
They sent Eli out to get someone.
Me and Denny looked into it, but there wasn't anyone within five miles of that power plant.
Hey, I think I found a link between the shootings of Congressman Hill and that journalist in Virginia.
Jeff Brooks, right?
Killed in Virginia while investigating a story about a potential scandal involving our government selling weapons to Syrian rebels.
- I never heard of that.
- Yeah.
Because it never came out.
The story got discredited after Brooks died, and it never gained traction.
Then a few months later, a House Oversight Committee opens an investigation.
And Congressman Hill was on that committee.
He chaired that committee.
So Wythe and his goons could be taking out anyone looking into this arms scandal.
What happened to the inquiry?
Well, it went away after
Congressman Hill had to retire due to his injuries.
However, two weeks ago, there's a resolution proposed in the Senate to establish a committee to investigate these same allegations.
Who proposed this resolution?
Senator Glass from Indiana.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Senator Alison Glass?
- Right.
- Her name came up in a search of potential political targets in town yesterday.
That's right...
She was giving a speech up in Harlem.
She still here?
Holy crap, boss, she's set to appear at the new green energy building on Roosevelt Island.
Guys, that's across the street from yesterday's shooting.
Eli would have had the perfect vantage point from that power plant.
Senator Glass is our target.
So Eli got the location right but the date wrong?
Eli's wife said he had a bike accident, hit his head the day before the shooting.
Maybe it scrambled the program being uploaded into his brain.
Come on, Al.
That's a little farfetched, no?
No more so than the rest of this.
We need to cancel the senator's appearance before somebody else gets a phone call that turns them into a killer.
You gonna take on a senator, boss?
You got that kind of pull?
I got friends in low places.
Let's do it.
I was, uh, surprised to get your call.
It's good to see you.
- How's retirement treating you?
- It's good.
I got a lot of extra time, and I'm catching up on reading.
I'm thinking of learning French.
Parlez-vous ?

Growing kale.
Kale?
Sounds great.
It's horrible.
I'm losing my mind.
I'm a cop.
Cops don't grow kale.
We're working on getting you reinstated.
Should get word in a day or two.
In the meantime, if you're interested,
I can use a little help...
- I'll do it.
- [laughs]
So you're asking me to cancel the senator's event, which the media's gonna be all over, for some crackpot conspiracy theory?
Yeah, I mean, I know it sounds out there, but we have reason to believe that the senator's life could be in danger.
There was a shooting at the factory next door to your event yesterday.
Come on, Haley.
You're her Chief of Staff.
You need to be looking out for her.
It's pretty thin, Sandra, and I hate to remind you, but you're not a cop anymore.
Oh, all right.
Well, I hate to remind you that I know about the senator's trip to Park City last year when she was supposed to be at...
- Blackmail?
Really?
- Mm-hmm.
Her life could be in danger.
Can you give me a name of the suspect, a description... anything?
Right now, the killer could be anyone.
That's our MO, but we...
Find me a suspect, I'll reconsider.

All right, we need to figure out what just happened here...
An act of terrorism, disgruntled former employee, someone making a political statement?
What do we know about this guy?
Eli Condon, 45, worked as columnist in a small newspaper out in Westchester, married, three kids.
According to the coworkers I talked with, he's the nicest guy in the office.
They're all totally shocked.
They sense anything off with him recently, problems at home, at work?
No, there's nothing like that.
The guy has a clean record.
He doesn't even have a parking ticket.
Why the old power plant?
Been shut down for six months.
Anyone in his family work there or for that company?
There's nothing linking him to the power plant.
I can't even find any evidence that Condon set foot on Roosevelt Island before today.
All right, well, then what the hell was he doing there?
History of mental illness, suffering from PTSD?
Guy shoots a gun like that, he must have military experience, right?
He's got a clean bill of health.
Guy's got no service record.
It's looking like Eli Condon's a totally normal guy.
No, totally normal guys don't go on shooting rampages.
Something set Condon off.
Keep digging into him.
Yeah, you got it.
Jay, work up a timeline of Condon's movements leading up to the shooting.
We need to know if he was a lone wolf or if others were involved.
Hey, Delina, I need to see the body.
Hey.
Thought you were ordered to take the day off to meet with psych services.
Yeah, well, you know how I feel about psych services.
Take a look.
Something bothering you?
Ever since I saw him today,
I keep getting this feeling that I've met him before, but I know I haven't.

Nothing.
Can you talk to me about the autopsy?

Could have been from a needle.

Okay.
Thanks.

I just...
I don't know what it is.
All right, relax.

Something's going on here.
You said something about a task force?
I don't want to talk about that.
I think we should.
Has anyone talked to Eli's wife?
No.
Well, let's start there.
Okay.
Your people have been here all day, tearing the place apart, treating Eli like he's some terrorist or something.
W... what am I supposed to tell my girls?
Mrs. Condon, we know this is difficult.
We're just trying to understand how your husband could behave in a way so unlike the incredible man you just told me about.
Was he upset lately?
Problems at home?
Eli never had a bad day.
He was always so cheerful and optimistic, the gentlest person I knew.
Is it possible he was hiding something from you?
We didn't keep secrets.
Eli was happy.
He adores his kids, and... we were about to celebrate our tenth anniversary with a trip to Italy.
- When?
- A few weeks.
We were supposed to go on a biking tour.
Eli's been training every morning and night.
Just last night, I told him to cut it out after he swiped a car and nearly got killed.
How bad was the accident?
He went over the handlebars.
The helmet got the worst of it.
I forced him to go to the emergency room, and they ran some tests, but... everything checked out.
Eli left this morning at the normal time, 8:15, and texted from the office saying he was feeling better.
You had no idea he was going into the city?
None.
He didn't like the city.
He felt claustrophobic... although...
What?
He went into Manhattan yesterday for a job interview.
Why would he get a job in the city if he didn't like it there?
You know what a suburban paper pays?
He was supposed to meet with a political news website,
"Metropolis Report."
Eli said he'd be a fool to turn his nose at that kind of money.
You know who he met with?
No, but they canceled at the last minute.
Excuse me, I found this in your daughter's room.
Do you know where it came from?
Lulu has a lot of toys and stuffed animals.
I...
I have no idea.
Do you think maybe your husband gave it to her?
Maybe.
He always brought her presents from his work trips.
Okay, so do you think maybe he could have gotten it at a carnival?
- A carnival upstate?
- Carrie.
I...
A carnival in Warrensburg, perhaps?
I told you, I don't know where it came from.
Well, maybe I can talk to your daughter.
- She might know.
- Carrie, enough.
Thank you for your time, Mrs. Condon.
What was that about?
Her husband shot two security guards, shot at us, okay?
He's the criminal, not the victim.
I was asking questions, which is my job.
You should try doing yours.
That woman doesn't know anything.
What was that about a stuffed animal?
I...
I don't know.
Somehow Eli is attached, connected to this carnival and these images I keep having in my head.
Look, I have complete faith in your memory, but I also know you obsess over things, and I don't want to see that happen.
How many times do I have to tell you that I don't need you to protect me,
I don't want you to protect me?
- I'm fine.
- Mm-hmm.
- Jay?
- Yup?
Any progress tracking Condon's movements today?
He did go to work like his wife said, but then he got on the Metro North at 10:55 out of Scarsdale, got into Grand Central at 11:40 a.m.
Shooting took place about an hour after he arrived.
Did you find any calls, emails prompting him to head into the city?
No, nothing.
Looks like he got here, headed straight for the power plant.
Not much to work with.
Anything on his job interview yesterday?
You mean alleged job interview, right?
- Alleged?
- No one at "Metropolis Report"
knows anything about Eli Condon.
All right, his wife said it was canceled last-minute.
Did he get any calls around the time of the interview?
His only incoming call around that time was a robo call.
So the job interview story was bogus?
What, having an affair?
Why lie to his wife, and where would he have this romantic rendezvous?
Already ahead of you, boss.
Looks like he got a bottle of water and some breath mints at a bodega down on East 49th Street as soon as he got into the city yesterday.
I did a facial recognition search on all the cameras in the immediate area, and we got a positive match for Eli Condon.
11:32 yesterday morning, he enters the Ardmore building.
You get him coming out too?
Exits the building at 1:45 p.m.
The building doesn't exactly scream "affair," does it?
So what was he doing in there for two hours?
I don't know, but get this.
Visitors log show no record of Eli.
There's only three names in that time period, and they're all women.
We need to know who he was visiting.
Boss, that building's got hundreds of tenants.
Get his picture to every office in that building.
Someone in there has a connection to our shooter.
You got it.
Come on, come on.
Valerie, right?
Yeah, we met at the ski lodge in Vermont a few years back.
- Oh, come on.
- You still work for "Vogue"?
October 24, 2001, you read an article in "Maxim" that told you role-playing spices things up in the bedroom.
Well, things must have gotten pretty spicy that night for me to remember it so perfectly.
Except that my name was Victoria and I worked for "The Atlantic."
You had a giggling fit every time I referred to your chosen name of Chet.
And then things got so weird, you started sweating profusely and had a panic attack... game over.
How's that for spicy?
Ah, poor Chet doesn't know what he missed.
So, Eli Condon...
Jay tracked him to the Ardmore building yesterday.
We're working on who he met with.
So far we don't have a contact for Eli in the building, but the only call Eli got yesterday was from a burner cell.
It lasted eight seconds.
So we got nothing.
We keep hitting roadblocks with this.
I mean, we're not getting anywhere.
Maybe I should just... man up and talk to the people on the task force, see if they remember anything about Eli.
Maybe they knew him.
I don't know.
Now, listen, I'm in the dark here.
Talk to me.
It was 2006.
I'd left Syracuse.
I'd left you.
I wanted to leave it all behind.
I was done being a cop, but this was different...
CIA.
They recruited me because of my special abilities.
We were assigned with tracking down a rogue NSA agent and taking him out.
He was leaking classified information to the wrong people.
No one could find him, but we did.
We found him, and we killed him... and then it was over.
We disappeared back into our own lives, weren't allowed to contact each other, but that was fine with me.
I wanted nothing to do with any of them.
- Too many...
- Memories.
Right.
Okay.
Let's you and me give this one more shot before you reach out.
Okay.
I did a little research on the Warrensburg Carnival from 2006.
Figured if I tell you a few details, maybe it'll trigger something.
Okay.
So, while at this carnival, did you enjoy
John Ormsbee's award-winning "Grateful Red" chili?
No, although I do love a terrible pun with my chili.
I'll bet you do.
All right, do you remember Estragon, grand champion breeding heifer?
No, I don...
I don't recall a cow named Estragon.
Okay, well, those are the only two storylines coming out of the carnival that the local paper saw fit to print.
There's no mention of your softball-throwing exploits.
Well, there should have been.
I was on fire.
Yeah!
No.
October 20, 2006 is going to send me over the edge.
I have to figure this out.
October 20, 2006?
Yes.
You know, the, uh...
Warrensburg Carnival was on May 8th that year.
No, that's impossible.
Well, it's hard to believe, but your memory's wrong.
Okay, Peter Roach, where are you?
Where are you?
"Special Agent Peter Roach, killed in a training accident on January 21, 2013."
All right, Sam McQuaid.
"ATF, killed in the line of duty on February 18, 2013."
Peter and Sam died within a month of each other.
Emmet Grinwis.
Don't tell me you're dead too.
"Terminated from the FBI two years ago.
Three stays in mental institutions.
Last known address, Newburgh."
What is going on?
Brian Fenton.
- Hey.
- Hey.
What are you doing here so late?
Jay, you're just the guy I need.
"Brian Fenton, ATF.
File sealed,
Top secret clearance only."
Oh, so that's what you're doing so late at night.
You're breaking federal law.
I haven't broken any laws, at least... not yet.
No.
No way.
No, not this time, not happening.
That file says, "Stay away, Jay." No.
Something's going on here, and I need your help.
You're the only one I trust to do this.
Please.
You know what?
Just do me a favor, okay?
Promise me you're gonna say nice things at my trial after the Feds come drag me out of here, all right?
- Oh, thank you.
- Oh, okay, right.
Hey, look at you, in early doing paperwork like a big guy.
Yeah, I like it.
It classes you up a bit.
It's just temporary till Sandra gets back.
- We should know in a day or two.
- Yeah, that's great, but I'm just saying, being the boss suits you.
I take it you're here for some other reason than to annoy me, right?
We tracked the rifle Eli used.
It's a military prototype.
Prototype?
It's supposed to be the sniper rifle of the future.
DoD scrapped the program about five years ago.
How did Eli get his hands on it?
Weapon he used traces back to a pallet of guns stolen from Langley, 2009.
Langley, as in home of the CIA?
Get this... guns from the same pallet used in the shootings of Congressman Hill about a year ago in New Mexico and the killing of journalist Jeff Brooks in Virginia a few months before that.
The same prototype was used in three shootings?
Get me everything you can on these other cases.
All right.
Hey.
Hey.
Thanks for coming by.
I tried Carrie, but I couldn't get her.
Yeah, she's seeing an old colleague.
What do you got?
So the tox results came in for Eli Condon.
Curious thing... he wasn't drunk or high in the usual sense of the word, but there were traces of dextro-lysergamide in his system.
Which is a good thing or a bad thing?
Dextro-lysergamide is part of a group of powerful antipsychotic drugs called psychotropics.
But we didn't find any history of mental illness, and Eli wasn't taking any prescribed medications.
Right, but see, the thing about psychotropics is they've been linked to mind manipulation and mental control, so it's possible that...
Mind control?
I know it sounds crazy.
I'm just telling you what I found.
All right, can you tell me when this drug was put into Eli's system?
Well, it's hard to give an exact time, but I'd say within the last 36 hours.
So right around the time Eli went into the Ardmore building.
- Thank you.
- You got it.
'Scuse me.
Emmet?
Emmet?
I'm Carrie Wells.
You're that memory cop.
Yeah, that's right.
You want to put the gun down?
I know why you're here... to kill me.
Just like you killed Roach.
I didn't kill anybody.
Emmet...
I'm gonna put my gun away.
I just want to talk to you.
You remember that carnival we went to, all of us together?
There's something not right about that night.
I think about that carnival all the time.
You do?
It's kind of odd.
My past, the present... doesn't stick with me anymore, but that carnival is clear as day.
What... what do you remember about the carnival, Emmet?
I remember me and you and Pete, Sam...
- celebrating.
- Right.
Walking around, had a few beers.
And then I impressed you all with my arm.
What do you mean?
The milk bottles.
I knocked them over.
No, I...
I knocked them over.
Hell, no, you didn't knock them over.
You guys were cheering me on.
I couldn't have done it without you.
"Six in a row!
Way to go!"
Sorry.
You remembered wrong.
No.
I don't...
I don't ever remember things wrong.
Are you saying you threw all those strikes?
Yeah.
I knocked the milk bottles down.
Where are you going?
To prove your memory wrong.
If you played the game, how did I wind up with this?
Hey, hey, boss, listen.
I looked into those shootings like you asked for.
Anything linking to Eli Condon?
Nothing definitive, right, but the MO's the same...
Two shooters.
Armando Lockett,
Skip Camirand.
Neither man had any criminal record, weapons training, mental illness, political activism... nothing.
Nothing pointing to a history of or capacity for violence whatsoever.
Both men... killed themselves after the shooting.
Sounds familiar.
ME reports showed some kind of weird drug in their system,
- a dextro...
- Dextro-lysergamide.
It's a mind control drug.
How do you know what?
It was in Eli's system too.
All right, come on, boss, seriously?
What, are we getting into some kind of conspiracy theory stuff here?
Killing of a political journalist, shooting a... a congressman?
All right.
Shooting up a closed power plant doesn't really track unless our shooter was just in the wrong spot?
You know what?
Put together a list of potential targets in the area of yesterday's shooting.
All right.
Hey, listen, I went to see Emmet, okay, one of the guys on the task force.
Now, he had a memory of the carnival too,
- except that his...
- I told you I'd go with you.
I know, I know, but listen.
He remembers everything like I do of that carnival, except that in his memory he's the one who was throwing the softball, not me.
Now, this guy is loopy.
He barely remembered who I was, but the carnival is crystal clear in his mind.
It's bizarre.
I don't know...
Something is going on here.
We found two other shootings in the last year with a similar MO to Eli's.
All three men had traces of a psychotropic in their systems.
It's possible someone manipulated these shooters.
What are you saying, mind control drug?
Hey, Carrie.
That file you wanted to read about, that guy you used to work with, Brian Fenton?
- You got in?
- Yeah.
Okay, so this guy Brian Fenton's claiming that he was in the ATF?
Bogus.
For the past 35 years, this guy's been in the scientific intelligence division of...
- Of the CIA.
- Yup, you got it.
In the early '80s he oversaw a Black Ops project called MJ Volt.
And it looks like it was a program aimed at making American soldiers immune to
Soviet interrogation techniques using mind control and memory manipulation, also known as brainwashing.
Only researchers started to believe that they could use the same techniques to gain control over unsuspecting subjects.
So agents so covert they don't even know their own involvement?
Okay, "started to believe"
is very different than actually accomplishing, okay?
Which this program never did, did they?
No, actually.
Project Volt didn't achieve anything other than losing a ton of dough.
- Got shut down in 1986.
- Exactly.
Jay, did you find anyone else associated with this Project Volt?
Would you stop trying to connect dots that don't exist?
Actually, Carrie,
I did find a list of professors and scientists linked to the project, so, yeah.
Look, I just think we should consider the possibility that someone rebooted this program and made it operational, and somehow you might be involved.
Oh, my God.
Re... there is no way someone got into my head, brainwashed me without me knowing it.
Will you please just look at the photos
- and see if you recognize anyone?
- Yes.
If this project is active, someone else might die.
You might be the one who could stop it.
I just said yes.
Show me the photos.
O... kay.
No.
Nope.
No.
No.
Stop there.
Six in a row!
Way to go!
Dr. Edward Wythe, Yale?
No, no, that guy's not a doctor.
He's a carny.
I mean, he's the guy who was working the milk bottle toss
- at the carnival.
- Are you sure?
Yes, I'm sure.
If that's true,
Wythe might be who Eli went to see at the Ardmore building.
Well, I guess there's only one way to find out, isn't there?
Building security says a man resembling Wythe but using a different name is renting an office here in the basement.
He's not here.
Dextro-lysergamide.
If this is from today, then Wythe has activated another killer.
Hey, boss, I got a BOLO out on Wythe.
Got his picture circulating in every airport, train station, and bridge.
Great, but right now we need to focus on tracking down this possible shooter.
Oh, with no ID, no description, no potential target?
I mean, we're good, boss, but we can't find a ghost.
What about potential targets in town yesterday?
They sent Eli out to get someone.
Me and Denny looked into it, but there wasn't anyone within five miles of that power plant.
Hey, I think I found a link between the shootings of Congressman Hill and that journalist in Virginia.
Jeff Brooks, right?
Killed in Virginia while investigating a story about a potential scandal involving our government selling weapons to Syrian rebels.
- I never heard of that.
- Yeah.
Because it never came out.
The story got discredited after Brooks died, and it never gained traction.
Then a few months later, a House Oversight Committee opens an investigation.
And Congressman Hill was on that committee.
He chaired that committee.
So Wythe and his goons could be taking out anyone looking into this arms scandal.
What happened to the inquiry?
Well, it went away after
Congressman Hill had to retire due to his injuries.
However, two weeks ago, there's a resolution proposed in the Senate to establish a committee to investigate these same allegations.
Who proposed this resolution?
Senator Glass from Indiana.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Senator Alison Glass?
- Right.
- Her name came up in a search of potential political targets in town yesterday.
That's right...
She was giving a speech up in Harlem.
She still here?
Holy crap, boss, she's set to appear at the new green energy building on Roosevelt Island.
Guys, that's across the street from yesterday's shooting.
Eli would have had the perfect vantage point from that power plant.
Senator Glass is our target.
So Eli got the location right but the date wrong?
Eli's wife said he had a bike accident, hit his head the day before the shooting.
Maybe it scrambled the program being uploaded into his brain.
Come on, Al.
That's a little farfetched, no?
No more so than the rest of this.
We need to cancel the senator's appearance before somebody else gets a phone call that turns them into a killer.
You gonna take on a senator, boss?
You got that kind of pull?
I got friends in low places.
Let's do it.
I was, uh, surprised to get your call.
It's good to see you.
- How's retirement treating you?
- It's good.
I got a lot of extra time, and I'm catching up on reading.
I'm thinking of learning French.
Parlez-vous ?
I'm growing a garden.
Growing kale.
Kale?
Sounds great.
It's horrible.
I'm losing my mind.
I'm a cop.
Cops don't grow kale.
We're working on getting you reinstated.
Should get word in a day or two.
In the meantime, if you're interested,
I can use a little help...
I'll do it.
So you're asking me to cancel the senator's event, which the media's gonna be all over, for some crackpot conspiracy theory?
Yeah, I mean, I know it sounds out there, but we have reason to believe that the senator's life could be in danger.
There was a shooting at the factory next door to your event yesterday.
Come on, Haley.
You're her Chief of Staff.
You need to be looking out for her.
It's pretty thin, Sandra, and I hate to remind you, but you're not a cop anymore.
Oh, all right.
Well, I hate to remind you that I know about the senator's trip to Park City last year when she was supposed to be at...
- Blackmail?
Really?
- Mm-hmm.
Her life could be in danger.
Can you give me a name of the suspect, a description... anything?
Right now, the killer could be anyone.
That's our MO, but we...
Find me a suspect, I'll reconsider.
All right.
Sandra struck out with the senator's people.
They didn't think it was a credible threat.
- What do you got there?
- Nothing.
I'm going over security footage from the Ardmore building today.
If your theory is right and Wythe activated a killer to go after the senator, well,
I thought if I go through the footage, I might see something that'll be useful when we're at the event later today.
Yeah, you really think it's a good idea for you to go to the event?
I mean, with everything going on, your connection to Eli...
Al... back off.
I'm quite capable of doing my job.
You know me.
Okay.
Shit.
Come on.
No, don't...
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Look...
I know you're under a lot of stress.
Al, I have to tell you something.
I have...
Hello?
Six in a row.
Way to go.
Got it.
Thanks.
What was that?
Personal.
You know, you're right.
I don't think I should be at the senator's event today.
Okay.
You were gonna tell me something?
No.
I need a minute.
I got unis posted in every building near the event, doubled up Senator Glass's security presence.
I'm heading down there.
Let me know if you find anything on Fenton or Wythe.
You got it, boss.
Where'd Carrie go?
She was just there a few minutes ago.
... shit.
- Zone six is clear.
- Hey.
Hey, restricted area.
Oh, not for me, Officer Sanford.
Okay, Detective.
Yeah, thanks.
- Anything to report?
- No, it's quiet.
Get an ID on the shooter yet?
Nothing.
Zone six is clear.
- Where's zone six?
- In the power plant.
Carrie, you there?
Come in.
Carrie?
Hey, I already checked in there.
It's clear... check the north side of the building.
Carrie, drop the gun.
It's me, Al.
Don't do this.
Six in a row.
Way to go.
No!
No!
Listen to me.
Listen.
- Listen, Carrie!
- No!
You were never at a carnival.
That memory is not real.
They planted it in your mind.
I need you to remember what's real.
You can do it.
I know you can.
You're stronger than whatever they did to you.
Come back.
Come back to me.
Six in a row.
Way to go!
Si-si-six... six in a row.
Way to go!
Come back.
By rewiring their brains through a combination of hypnosis, drugs, and shock therapy,
I've been able to force these people to remember things that they've never even experienced and even more importantly, do whatever I like.
Aah!
Six in a row.
Way to go!
Do they know what's happening right now?
Are we safe?
Well, I've conditioned them to believe that they're spending their evening at a carnival.
They will have no recollection whatsoever of anything that goes on here tonight.
You're certain?
We'll go down if one of them remembers this.
I'm certain, and if they do, we can make more.
In a few hours, I will release them back to their lives blissfully unaware that they have been weaponized here tonight.
When we have a mission,
I will call one of them back, upload the target, and activate them with a simple phone call.
Why these people?
Well, you tell me, Fenton.
What do security guards and lawyers, stadium workers, police officers, federal agents, journalists... what do they all have in common?
Trust and familiarity.
- Nobody will suspect them.
- Exactly.
Take this beauty, Carrie Wells, former detective.
She has a perfect memory.
Now... imagine the possibilities of a memory capacity so large.
Drugging people is one thing.
Controlling them is quite another.
Perhaps you need a further demonstration.
Six in a row.
Way to go!
Carrie, there's a weapon on the table behind you.
Would you kill this man, Brian Fenton?
Call her off, Wythe.
Call her off!
Thank you, Carrie.
Have a seat.
The perfect killer, stripped of conscience and morality.
We will build an army so secret that not even the soldiers will know they've enlisted.
Oh...
Oh, my God.
The s... the senator, did I...
No, no, no, you figured it out first.
Thank God.
How did you find me?
I followed you.
- How did you...
- I know my girl.
The second you got that phone call,
I knew something was wrong.
You didn't look like you anymore.
You're back.
Lieutenant Burns, do you copy?
This is Lieutenant Burns.
The power plant is clear.
You can stand down.
All right, let's get out of here.
You know, we're still gonna have to track down Wythe and Fenton.
- You gonna be up for it?
- Is the Pope Catholic?
Had I known you were susceptible to mind control,
I would have tried it years ago.
Oh, yeah?
Would you use it for good or for evil?
Ah... define evil.
- Hey, Al?
- Hmm?
I'm sorry.
When I said I didn't need you to protect me, I...
I was just...
I...
I do need you.
I do.
I need you all the time.
The day you walked back into my life...
Technically, you walked back into mine, my little apartment in Queens.
5:00 a.m, you were pounding on the door...
- Boom, boom, boom.
- It was a gentle knock.
And I said, "Hey, you don't have to break it down.
I hear you."
Nice to see you too.
- I love you.
- What?
Yeah, I know.
It scares you.
I don't care.
It's the truth.
I love you.
Always have, always will.
Wow, that's, um...
You know, I never thought
I would be brave enough to go down this path again or admit this, but I...
Al?
Al!
Al?
Al, look at me!
Al, I need you!
Stay awake.
Okay, just... no!
Keep your eyes open!
Al, no, come on.
Come on!
Al!
Get me an ambulance!
Al?
Stay awake.
Stay awake.
No, no, no, no, no.
Al, no, come on.
Oh, my God.
(SIREN BLARING) (GUNSHOTS)
MAN: (OVER RADIO) We have shots fired, 402 River Street.
Get the exits, exits, exits.
Let's go, go, go, go.
Let's go.
(TIRES SCREECHING)
(SIREN CHIRPS)
AL:
Remind me why we came in here.
'Cause you're a glory hound.
Even I remember coming in alone was your idea.
All right, two guards have already been shot.
Any ideas how to stop this guy before this turns into a bloodbath?
No, not really.
(GUNSHOT)
(GRUNTS) Guess we found him.
All right, cover me.
I'm heading upstairs.
Yeah, there you go, stealing my glory again. (CHUCKLES)
Be careful.
(GUNSHOTS)
(GUNSHOTS)
(GUNSHOTS)
Turn around and drop your weapon!
Now!
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
Six in a row.
What?
Way to go.
BOTH:
Yeah!
Yes!
Six in a row!
Way to go!
No. (GUNSHOT)
Oh, my
(SIREN BLARING IN DISTANT)
Great work taking down that shooter, boss.
Two security guards he shot are gonna pull through.
We got lucky.
No, we got Carrie Wells on our side.
How's she doing, by the way?
Let's all keep an eye on her today.
Absolutely.
Of course.
All right, we need to figure out what just happened here.
An act of terrorism, disgruntled former employee, someone making a political statement?
What do we know about this guy?
(KEYS CLACKING)
Eli Condon, 45, worked as columnist in a small newspaper out in Westchester, married, three kids.
According to the co-workers I talked with, he's the nicest guy in the office.
They're all totally shocked.
They sense anything off with him recently, problems at home, at work?
No, there's nothing like that.
The guy has a clean record.
He doesn't even have a parking ticket.
Why the old power plant?
Been shut down for six months.
Anyone in his family work there or for that company?
There's nothing linking him to the power plant.
I can't even find any evidence that Condon set foot on Roosevelt Island before today.
All right, well, then what the hell was he doing there?
History of mental illness, suffering from PTSD?
Guy shoots a gun like that, he must have military experience, right?
He's got a clean bill of health.
Guy's got no service record.
It's looking like Eli Condon's a totally normal guy.
No, totally normal guys don't go on shooting rampages.
Something set Condon off.
Keep digging into him.
Yeah, you got it.
Jay, work up a timeline of Condon's movements leading up to the shooting.
We need to know if he was a lone wolf or if others were involved.
Hey, Delina, I need to see the body.
Hey.
Thought you were ordered to take the day off to meet with psych services.
Yeah, well, you know how I feel about psych services. (SIGHS)
Take a look.
(SIGHS)
Something bothering you?
Ever since I saw him today,
I keep getting this feeling that I've met him before, but I know I haven't.
MAN:
Six in a row!
(SCREAMING)
Carrie, what is it?
Nothing.
Can you talk to me about the autopsy?
Um, did you find anything unusual, out of the ordinary?
A small puncture on his shoulder.
Could have been from a needle.
Lab tests will tell me if there was anything in his system.
Okay.
Thanks.
Listen, I...
I haven't thought about... this carnival in years.
And then I see Eli at the power plant, and suddenly it's popping into my head over and over, and I don't know why except that
I feel like there's some kind of connection between Eli and the carnival.
I just...
I don't know what it is.
All right, relax.
(INHALES DEEPLY)
Put yourself back at that carnival, all right?
If Eli Condon is there, we'll find him together.
We've done this before.
Focus and just tell me what you see.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
MAN:
Here we go.
Come on, Carrie, you got this.
Come on, come on.
Come on, come on.
(CLATTERING)
I'm throwing balls at the milk bottle toss.
MAN:
Whoo!
Yes, yes!
Whoo!
I won six times.
Six in a row.
Way to go!
(CHUCKLING)
Whoo!
Yes, Carrie, yes!
The guys from the task force are there with me.
Do you see Eli Condon anywhere?
Where are you, Eli?
(CHURCH BELL TOLLING)
What?
What is it?
I was at the carnival, but then it was gone, and then I was someplace else...
Someplace I've never been, but it felt like I was re-experiencing it, like a memory, which doesn't make any sense.
Something's going on here.
You said something about a task force?
I don't want to talk about that.
Oh, I think we should.
Has anyone talked to Eli's wife?
No.
Well, let's start there.
Okay.
MRS. CONDON:
Your people have been here all day, tearing the place apart, treating Eli like he's some terrorist or something.
What am I supposed to tell my girls?
Mrs. Condon, we know this is difficult.
(GASPS) We're just trying to understand how your husband could behave in a way so unlike the incredible man you just told me about.
Was he upset lately?
Problems at home?
Eli never had a bad day.
He was always so... cheerful and optimistic, the gentlest person I knew.
Is it possible he was hiding something from you?
We didn't keep secrets.
Eli was happy.
He adores his kids, and...
We were about to celebrate our 10th anniversary with a trip to Italy.
When?
A few weeks.
We were supposed to go on a biking tour.
Eli's been training every morning and night.
Just last night, I told him to cut it out after he swiped a car and nearly got killed.
How bad was the accident?
He went over the handlebars.
The helmet got the worst of it.
I forced him to go to the emergency room, and they ran some tests, but everything checked out.
(SOBBING)
(MAN LAUGHING)
(LAUGHING)
Eli left this morning at the normal time, 8:15, and texted from the office saying he was feeling better.
You had no idea he was going into the city?
None.
He didn't like the city.
He felt...
Claustrophobic...
Although...
What?
He went into Manhattan yesterday for a job interview.
Why would he get a job in the city if he didn't like it there?
(SCOFFS) You know what a suburban paper pays?
He was supposed to meet with a political news website,
Metropolis Report.
Eli said he'd be a fool to turn his nose at that kind of money.
You know who he met with?
No, but they canceled at the last minute.
Excuse me, I found this in your daughter's room.
Do you know where it came from?
Lulu has a lot of toys and stuffed animals.
I...
I have no idea.
Do you think maybe your husband gave it to her?
Maybe.
He always brought her presents from his work trips.
Okay, so do you think maybe he could have gotten it at a carnival?
A carnival upstate?
Carrie.
I...
A carnival in Warrensburg, perhaps?
I told you, I don't know where it came from.
Well, maybe I can talk to your daughter.
She might know.
Carrie, enough.
Thank you for your time, Mrs. Condon.
What was that about?
Her husband shot two security guards, shot at us, okay?
He's the criminal, not the victim.
I was asking questions, which is my job.
You should try doing yours.
That woman doesn't know anything.
(SIGHS) What was that about a stuffed animal?
I...
I don't know.
Somehow Eli is attached, connected to this carnival and these images I keep having in my head.
Look, I have complete faith in your memory, but I also know you obsess over things, and I don't want to see that happen.
How many times do I have to tell you that I don't need you to protect me,
I don't want you to protect me?
I'm fine.
Mmm-hmm.
Jay?
Yup?
Any progress tracking Condon's movements today?
He did go to work like his wife said, but then he got on the Metro North at 10:55 out of Scarsdale, got into Grand Central at 11:40 a.m.
Shooting took place about an hour after he arrived.
Did you find any calls, emails prompting him to head into the city?
No, nothing.
Looks like he got here, headed straight for the power plant.
Not much to work with.
Anything on his job interview yesterday?
You mean alleged job interview, right?
Alleged?
No one at Metropolis Report knows anything about Eli Condon.
All right, his wife said it was canceled last-minute.
Did he get any calls around the time of the interview?
His only incoming call around that time was a robot-call.
So the job interview story was bogus?
What, having an affair?
Why lie to his wife, and where would he have this romantic rendezvous?
Already ahead of you, boss.
(KEYBOARD CLACKING)
Looks like he got a bottle of water and some breath mints at a bodega down on East 49th Street as soon as he got into the city yesterday.
I did a facial recognition search on all the cameras in the immediate area, and we got a positive match for Eli Condon.
11:32 yesterday morning, he enters the Ardmore building.
You get him coming out too?
Exits the building at 1:45 p.m.
The building doesn't exactly scream, "affair," does it?
So what was he doing in there for two hours?
I don't know, but get this.
Visitors log show no record of Eli.
There's only three names in that time period, and they're all women.
We need to know who he was visiting.
Boss, that building's got hundreds of tenants.
Get his picture to every office in that building.
Someone in there has a connection to our shooter.
(SNAPS FINGERS) You got it.
(MUTTERING) Come on, come on.
Valerie, right?
Yeah, we met at the ski lodge in Vermont a few years back.
(CHUCKLES) Oh, come on.
You still work for Vogue?
October 24, 2001, you read an article in Maxim that told you role-playing spices things up in the bedroom.
Well, things must have gotten pretty spicy that night for me to remember it so perfectly.
Except that my name was Victoria and I worked for The Atlantic.
You had a giggling fit every time I referred to your chosen name of Chet.
And then things got so weird, you started sweating profusely and had a panic attack.
Game over.
How's that for spicy?
Ah, poor Chet doesn't know what he missed.
So, Eli Condon.
Jay tracked him to the Ardmore building yesterday.
We're working on who he met with.
So far we don't have a contact for Eli in the building, but the only call Eli got yesterday was from a burner cell.
It lasted eight seconds.
So we got nothing.
We keep hitting roadblocks with this.
I mean, we're not getting anywhere.
Maybe I should just...
Man up and talk to the people on the task force, see if they remember anything about Eli.
Maybe they knew him.
I don't know.
Now, listen,
I'm in the dark here.
Talk to me.
It was 2006.
I'd left Syracuse.
I'd left you.
I wanted to leave it all behind.
I was done being a cop, but this was different...
CIA.
They recruited me because of my special abilities.
We were assigned with... with tracking down a rogue NSA agent and taking him out.
He was leaking classified information to the wrong people.
No one could find him, but we did.
We found him, and we killed him...
And then it was over.
We disappeared back into our own lives, weren't allowed to contact each other, but that was fine with me.
I wanted nothing to do with any of them.
Too many...
Memories.
Right.
(INHALES DEEPLY) Okay.
Let's you and me give this one more shot before you reach out.
Okay.
I did a little research on the Warrensburg Carnival from 2006.
Figured if I tell you a few details, maybe it'll trigger something.
Okay.
So, while at this carnival, did you enjoy John Ormsbee's award-winning.
"Grateful Red" chili?
(LAUGHS)
No, although I do love a terrible pun with my chili.
I'll bet you do.
All right, do you remember Estragon, grand champion breeding heifer?
No, I don't...
I don't recall a cow named Estragon.
Okay, well, those are the only two storylines coming out of the carnival that the local paper saw fit to print.
There's no mention of your soft-ball-throwing exploits.
Well, there should have been.
I was on fire.
(SCREAMS)
BOTH:
Yeah!
No. (GUNSHOT ECHOES)
October 20, 2006 is going to send me over the edge.
I have to figure this out.
October 20, 2006?
Yes.
You know, the, uh...
Warrensburg Carnival was on May 8th that year.
No, that's impossible.
Well, it's hard to believe, but your memory's wrong.
(KEYBOARD CLACKING)
Okay, Peter Roach, where are you?
(WHISPERING) Where are you?
"Special Agent Peter Roach,"
"killed in a training accident on January 21, 2013."
All right, Sam McQuaid.
"ATF, killed in the line of duty on February 18, 2013."
Peter and Sam died within a month of each other.
Emmet Grinwis.
Don't tell me you're dead too.
"Terminated from the FBI two years ago."
"Three stays in mental institutions."
"Last known address, Newburgh."
What is going on?
Brian Fenton.
Hey.
Hey.
What are you doing here so late?
Jay, you're just the guy I need.
"Brian Fenton, ATF.
File sealed, Top secret clearance only."
Oh, so that's what you're doing so late at night.
You're breaking Federal Law.
I haven't broken any laws, at least... not yet.
No.
No way.
No, not this time, not happening.
That file says, "Stay away, Jay." No.
Something's going on here, and I need your help.
You're the only one I trust to do this.
Please.
You know what?
Just do me a favor, okay?
Promise me you're gonna say nice things at my trial after the Feds come drag me out of here, all right?
Oh...
Oh, thank you.
Oh, okay, right.
(CHUCKLES)
Hey, look at you, in early doing paperwork like a big guy.
Yeah, I like it.
It classes you up a bit.
It's just temporary till Sandra gets back.
We should know in a day or two.
Yeah, that's great, but I'm just saying, being the boss suits you.
I take it you're here for some other reason than to annoy me, right?
We tracked the rifle Eli used.
It's a military prototype.
Prototype?
It's supposed to be the sniper rifle of the future.
DoD scrapped the program about five years ago.
How did Eli get his hands on it?
Weapon he used traces back to a pallet of guns stolen from Langley, 2009.
Langley, as in home of the CIA?
Get this, guns from the same pallet used in the shootings of Congressman Hill about a year ago in New Mexico and the killing of journalist Jeff Brooks in Virginia a few months before that.
The same prototype was used in three shootings?
Get me everything you can on these other cases.
All right.
(KEYS CLACKING)
Hey.
Hey.
Thanks for coming by.
I tried Carrie, but I couldn't get her.
Yeah, she's seeing an old colleague.
What do you got?
So the tox results came in for Eli Condon.
Curious thing, he wasn't drunk or high in the usual sense of the word, but there were traces of dextrolysergamide in his system.
Which is a good thing or a bad thing?
Dextrolysergamide is part of a group of powerful antipsychotic drugs called psychotropics.
But we didn't find any history of mental illness, and Eli wasn't taking any prescribed medications.
Right, but see, the thing about psychotropics is they've been linked to mind manipulation and mental control, so it's possible that...
Mind control?
I know it sounds crazy.
I'm just telling you what I found.
All right, can you tell me when this drug was put into Eli's system?
Well, it's hard to give an exact time, but I'd say within the last 36 hours.
So right around the time Eli went into the Ardmore building.
Thank you.
You got it.
(SEAGULLS SCREECHING)
Excuse me.
All right.
Emmet?
(GUN COCKS)
Emmet?
I'm Carrie Wells.
You're that memory cop.
Yeah, that's right.
You want to put the gun down?
I know why you're here... to kill me.
Just like you killed Roach.
I didn't kill anybody.
Emmet...
I'm gonna put my gun away.
I just want to talk to you.
You remember that carnival we went to, all of us together?
There's something not right about that night.
I think about that carnival all the time.
You do?
(HESITATINGLY) It's kind of odd.
My past, the present doesn't stick with me anymore, but that carnival is clear as day.
What... what do you remember about the carnival, Emmet?
I remember me and you and Pete,
Sam... celebrating.
Right.
Walking around, had a few beers.
And then I impressed you all with my arm.
What do you mean?
The milk bottles.
I knocked them over.
No, I...
I knocked them over.
Hell, no, (SCOFFS) you didn't knock them over.
You guys were cheering me on.
I couldn't have done it without you.
"Six in a row!
Way to go!"
(MAKES CHEERING SOUND)
Sorry.
You remembered wrong.
No.
I don't
I don't ever remember things wrong.
Are you saying you threw all those strikes?
Yeah.
I knocked the milk bottles down.
Where are you going?
To prove your memory wrong.
If you played the game, how did I wind up with this?
Hey, hey, boss, listen.
I looked into those shootings like you asked for.
Anything linking to Eli Condon?
Nothing definitive, right, but the MO's the same Two shooters.
Armando Lockett, Skip Camirand.
Neither man had any criminal record, weapons training, mental illness, political activism, nothing.
Nothing pointing to a history of or capacity for violence, whatsoever.
Both men...
Killed themselves after the shooting.
Sounds familiar.
ME reports showed some kind of weird drug in their system.
A dextro...
Dextrolysergamide.
It's a mind control drug.
How do you know what?
It was in Eli's system too.
All right, come on, boss, seriously?
What, are we getting into some kind of conspiracy theory stuff here?
Killing of a political journalist, shooting a... a congressman?
All right.
Shooting up a closed power plant doesn't really track... unless our shooter was just in the wrong spot?
You know what?
Put together a list of potential targets in the area of yesterday's shooting.
All right.
Hey, listen, I went to see Emmet, okay, one of the guys on the task force.
Now, he had a memory of the carnival too.
Except that his...
I told you I'd go with you.
I know, I know, but listen.
He remembers everything like I do of that carnival, except that in his memory he's the one who was throwing the softball, not me.
Now, this guy is loopy.
He barely remembered who I was, but the carnival is crystal clear in his mind.
It's bizarre.
I don't know.
Something is going on here.
We found two other shootings in the last year with a similar MO to Eli's.
All three men had traces of a psychotropic in their systems.
It's possible someone manipulated these shooters.
What are you saying?
Mind control drugs?
JAY LEE:
Hey, Carrie.
That file you wanted to read about, that guy you used to work with, Brian Fenton?
You got in?
(SOFTLY) Yep.
Okay, so this guy Brian Fenton's claiming that he was in the ATF?
Bogus.
For the past 35 years, this guy's been in the scientific intelligence division of...
Of the CIA.
JAY LEE:
Yup, you got it.
In the early '80s he oversaw a Black Ops project called MJ Volt.
And it looks like it was a program aimed at making American soldiers immune to Soviet interrogation techniques using mind control and memory manipulation, also known as brainwashing.
Only researchers started to believe that they could use the same techniques to gain control over unsuspecting subjects.
So agents so covert they don't even know their own involvement?
Okay, "Started to believe"
is very different than actually accomplishing, okay?
Which this program never did, did they?
No, actually.
Project Volt didn't achieve anything other than losing a ton of dough.
Got shut down in 1986.
Exactly.
Jay, did you find anyone else associated with this Project Volt?
Would you stop trying to connect dots that don't exist?
JAY LEE:
Actually, Carrie,
I did find a list of professors and scientists linked to the project, so, yeah.
Look, I just think we should consider the possibility that someone rebooted this program and made it operational, and somehow you might be involved.
Oh, my God.
(SCOFFS) There is no way someone got into my head, brainwashed me without me knowing it.
Will you please just look at the photos and see if you recognize anyone?
Yes.
If this project is active, someone else might die.
You might be the one who could stop it.
I just said yes.
Show me the photos.
Okay. (CARRIE SIGHS) No.
(BEEPING) Nope.
No.
No.
Stop there.
Six in a row!
Way to go!
Dr. Edward Wythe, Yale?
No, no.
That guy's not a doctor.
He's a carny.
I mean, he's the guy who was working the milk bottle toss at the carnival.
It's...
Are you sure?
Yes, I'm sure.
If that's true,
Wythe might be who Eli went to see at the Ardmore building.
Well, I guess there's only one way to find out, isn't there?
AL:
Building security says a man resembling Wythe but using a different name is renting an office here in the basement.
He's not here.
Dextrolysergamide.
If this is from today, then Wythe has activated another killer.
Hey, boss, I got a BOLO out on Wythe.
Got his picture circulating in every airport, train station, and bridge.
Great, but right now we need to focus on tracking down this possible shooter.
Oh, with no ID, no description, no potential target?
I mean, we're good, boss, but we can't find a ghost.
What about potential targets in town yesterday?
They sent Eli out to get someone.
Me and Denny looked into it, but there wasn't anyone within five miles of that power plant.
DENNY:
Hey, I think I found a link between the shootings of Congressman Hill and that journalist in Virginia.
Jeff Brooks, right?
Killed in Virginia while investigating a story about a potential scandal involving our government selling weapons to Syrian rebels.
I never heard of that.
Yeah.
Because it never came out.
The story got discredited after Brooks died, and it never gained traction.
Then a few months later, a House Oversight Committee opens an investigation.
And Congressman Hill was on that committee.
He chaired that committee.
So Wythe and his goons could be taking out anyone looking into this arms scandal.
What happened to the inquiry?
Well, it went away after Congressman Hill had to retire due to his injuries.
However, two weeks ago, there's a resolution proposed in the Senate to establish a committee to investigate these same allegations.
Who proposed this resolution?
Senator Glass from Indiana.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Senator Alison Glass?
Right.
Her name came up in a search of potential political targets in town yesterday.
That's right.
She was giving a speech up in Harlem.
She still here?
Holy crap, boss, she's set to appear at the new green energy building on Roosevelt Island.
Guys, that's across the street from yesterday's shooting.
Eli would have had the perfect vantage point from that power plant.
Senator Glass is our target.
So Eli got the location right, but the date wrong?
Eli's wife said he had a bike accident, hit his head the day before the shooting.
Maybe it scrambled the program being uploaded into his brain.
Come on, Al.
That's a little far-fetched, no?
No more so than the rest of this.
(SIGHS)
We need to cancel the senator's appearance before somebody else gets a phone call that turns them into a killer.
You gonna take on a senator, boss?
You got that kind of pull?
I got friends in low places.
Let's do it.
I was, uh, surprised to get your call.
It's good to see you.
How's retirement treating you?
It's good.
I got a lot of extra time, and I'm catching up on reading.
I'm thinking of learning French.
Parlez-vous?
I'm growing a garden.
Growing kale.
Kale?
Sounds great.
(SOFTLY) Yeah.
It's horrible.
I'm losing my mind.
(CHUCKLES)
I'm a cop.
Cops don't grow kale.
We're working on getting you re-instated.
Should get word in a day or two.
In the meantime, if you're interested,
I can use a little help...
I'll do it.
(CHUCKLES)
HALEY:
So you're asking me to cancel the senator's event, which the media's gonna be all over, for some crackpot conspiracy theory?
Yeah, I mean, I know it sounds out there, but we have reason to believe that the senator's life could be in danger.
There was a shooting at the factory next door to your event yesterday.
Come on, Haley.
You're her Chief of Staff.
You need to be looking out for her.
It's pretty thin, Sandra, and I hate to remind you, but you're not a cop anymore.
Oh, all right.
Well, I hate to remind you that I know about the senator's trip to Park City last year when she was supposed to be at...
(CHUCKLES) Blackmail?
Really?
Mmm-hmm.
Her life could be in danger.
Can you give me a name of the suspect, a description, anything?
Right now, the killer could be anyone.
That's our MO, but we...
Find me a suspect, I'll reconsider.
All right.
Sandra struck out with the senator's people.
They didn't think it was a credible threat.
What do you got there?
Nothing.
I'm going over security footage from the Ardmore building today.
If your theory is right and Wythe activated a killer to go after the senator, well,
I thought if I go through the footage, I might see something that'll be useful when we're at the event later today.
Yeah, you really think it's a good idea for you to go to the event?
I mean, with everything going on, your connection to Eli...
Al...
Back off.
I'm quite capable of doing my job.
You know me.
Okay.
(WHISPERS) Shit.
(EXHALES)
Come on.
No, don't.
(KEYS CLACKING)
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Look...
I know you're under a lot of stress.
Al, I have to tell you something.
I have... (PHONE RINGS)
(BEEPS) Hello?
MAN:
Six in a row.
Way to go.
Got it.
Thanks.
(BEEPS) What was that?
Personal.
You know, you're right.
I don't think I should be at the senator's event today.
Okay.
You were gonna tell me something?
No.
I need a minute.
I got unis posted in every building near the event, doubled up Senator Glass's security presence.
I'm heading down there.
Let me know if you find anything on Fenton or Wythe.
You got it, boss.
Where'd Carrie go?
JAY LEE:
She was just there a few minutes ago.
Holy shit.
Zone six is clear.
Hey.
Hey, restricted area.
Oh, not for me, Officer Sanford.
Okay, Detective.
Yeah, thanks.
(GRUNTS)
Anything to report?
OFFICER:
No, it's quiet.
Get an ID on the shooter yet?
(CAR DOOR SHUTS) Nothing.
CARRIE: (ON RADIO) Zone six is clear.
Where's zone six?
In the power plant.
AL: (OVER RADIO) Carrie, you there?
Come in.
Carrie?
Hey, I already checked in there.
It's clear.
Check the north side of the building.
(INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER)
Carrie, drop the gun.
It's me, Al.
Don't do this.
Six in a row.
Way to go.
No!
No!
Listen to me.
Listen.
Listen, Carrie!
No!
You were never at a carnival.
That memory is not real.
They planted it in your mind.
(GRUNTS)
I need you to remember what's real.
(BREATHING HEAVILY) You can do it.
I know you can.
You're stronger than whatever they did to you.
(GASPS) Come back.
Come back to me.
Six in a row.
Way to go!
Six... six... six in a row.
Way to go!
Come back.
(GASPS)
(MACHINERY BEEPING)
WYTHE:
By rewiring their brains through a combination of hypnosis, drugs, and shock therapy,
I've been able to force these people to remember things that they've never even experienced and even more importantly, do whatever I like.
(ELECTRIC BUZZ) Aah!
Six in a row.
Way to go!
(LAUGHING)
Do they know what's happening right now?
Are we safe?
Well, I've conditioned them to believe that they're spending their evening at a carnival.
They will have no recollection whatsoever of anything that goes on here tonight.
You're certain?
We'll go down if one of them remembers this.
I'm certain, and if they do, we can make more.
In a few hours, I will release them back to their lives blissfully unaware that they have been weaponized here tonight.
When we have a mission,
I will call one of them back, upload the target, and activate them with a simple phone call.
Why these people?
Well, you tell me, Fenton.
What do security guards, and lawyers, stadium workers, police officers, federal agents, journalists, what do they all have in common?
Trust and familiarity.
Nobody will suspect them.
Exactly.
Take this beauty,
Carrie Wells, former detective.
She has a perfect memory.
Now...
Imagine the possibilities of a memory capacity so large.
Drugging people is one thing.
Controlling them is quite another.
Perhaps you need a further demonstration.
Six in a row.
Way to go!
(CLAPS) Carrie,
There's a weapon on the table behind you.
Would you kill this man, Brian Fenton?
Call her off, Wythe.
Call her off!
(WYTHE CHUCKLES)
Thank you, Carrie.
Have a seat. (CHUCKLES)
The perfect killer, stripped of conscience and morality.
We will build an army so secret that not even the soldiers will know they've enlisted.
(GASPING)
Oh... (WHISPERS) Oh, my God.
The senator, did I...
No, no, no.
You figured it out first.
(SOFTLY) Thank God.
How did you find me?
I followed you.
How did you...
I know my girl.
The second you got that phone call,
I knew something was wrong.
You didn't look like you anymore.
You're back.
MAN: (OVER RADIO) Lieutenant Burns, do you copy?
(BOTH CHUCKLE)
This is Lieutenant Burns.
The power plant is clear.
You can stand down.
All right, let's get out of here.
You know, we're still gonna have to track down Wythe and Fenton.
You gonna be up for it?
CARRIE:
Is the Pope Catholic?
Had I known you were susceptible to mind control,
I would have tried it years ago.
Oh, yeah?
Would you use it for good or for evil?
Ah... define evil.
(GIGGLES)
Hey, Al?
Hmm?
I'm sorry.
When I said I didn't need you to protect me, I...
I was just, I...
I do need you.
I do.
I need you all the time.
The day you walked back into my life.
Technically, you walked back into mine, my little apartment in Queens.
5:00 am, you were pounding on the door, boom, boom, boom.
It was a gentle knock.
And I said, "Hey, you don't have to break it down.
I hear you."
Nice to see you too.
I love you.
What?
Yeah, I know.
It scares you.
I don't care.
It's the truth.
I love you.
Always have, always will.
Wow, that's, um...
You know, I never thought I would be brave enough to go down this path again or admit this, but I... (RIFLE SHOT)
Al?
Al!
Al?
Al, look at me!
Al, I need you!
Stay awake.
Okay, just... no!
Keep your eyes open!
Al, no, come on.
Come on!
Al!
Get me an ambulance!
Al?
Stay awake.
Stay awake.
No, no, no, no, no.
Al, no, come on.
Oh, my God.
(SIRENS APPROACHING) (SOBS)
Oh, yeah.
Mmm.
Good year.
Good year.
And then I'm just gonna pulse it, pulse it, pulse it.
Bam, done.
Okay.
Who wants a Strawberry Latte Bull?
What is that?
Well, it's our three favorite morning beverages.
I'm talking strawberry Quik, decaf coffee, and Red Bull.
- Adam?
- Okay.
Please.
No, not while I'm handling firearms, which are what I'm calling my arms now 'cause my muscles are on fire from all this sling-shooting.
Whatever.
Ders, first up.
- Okay.
- There you go, buddy.
- Nice and frothy.
Mmm.
- Mmm.
- Mmm.
- Mm-mm.
Mm-mm?
What?
- Not good at all.
- Not good?
- That's surprising.
- That's--yeah.
But I'm gonna choke this one down because it is symbolic of our friendship.
And that's why you are the quarterback
- of our friendship.
- Okay.
So this is what the world's coming to.
Oh, my gosh, this is what the world's coming to.
That's what the world's coming to.
Mm-hmm.
- News boobies.
- Yeah.
I couldn't [bleep] to that if I tried.
- Mm.
- And I have, actually.
I used to jerk off to a Sears catalog all the time.
Or was it JCPenney's?
Could have been Cabela's, but the chicks were super hot.
- Similar--similar vibes.
- Mm.
Cabela babe.
[bird screeches]
- Oh, sh--
- What'd you do?
- Ah, I just shot it!
- Oh, direct hit!
- What?
No, no, no.
Hit it right in the face, right in the beak.
Oh, God, we got to save it.
We got to save her.
- Yeah, no, it's gargling.
- No, we have to save her.
- It's gargling.
- Dude, Blake.
Hey, whoa, whoa.

Yeah, but he died in a pool.
- There's honor in that.
- Poor little dude.
Actually, I don't even know if it's a dude because, you know, bird dicks are notoriously hard to locate.
I've been looking all morning.
I've actually spent my childhood locating bird dicks.

Am I the guy that took Rancho Cuca Pizza's
Twitter followers from 200 to 2,100 in 13 months?
Have I left over 20,000 Yelp reviews?
Do I DM with Rainn Wilson on the reg?
You bet your SoulPancakes I do.
I have no idea what this guy's talking about, but he seems...
pretty cool.
I came here to do two things-- destroy old media paradigms and increase sales using the power of viral marketing.
And it looks like we're almost out of old media paradigms.
[laughter]
- Was that funny?
- Oh.
- I don't know.
But I thought it was an appropriate time to laugh.
Hey, who is that guy?
He's really funny.
What?
Oh, it's me.
- Whoa!

Oh!
Oh, you're the guy from the video that we just watched.

No doubt.

- Oh, okay.
I'll take one.
Boom.
Sorry to crash the party, but as you know, millennials are a huge emerging demo.
- Yeah, I've heard that.
- I get that, yeah.
For sure, millennials.
And they're jacked into their devices 24/7, so that means we got to get you guys up on all the socials, blasting out content, jacking up hits, stacking up followers.
Jacking and stacking, baby.
And then convert all those followers into sales.
And that sounds pretty dope, right?

Okay.
Cruising on speedboats, getting turnt?
Yeah.
Nothing but energy drinks and freakin' plan B pills, baby!
That's the kind of life I want to live!

The birds.
Great birdwatching.
Yeah, the-- uh, yeah, I guess, sure.
Wait, uh, Klout Score?
How do we get to Havasu?
Oh, oh, I know what it is.
It's like a test you take on Facebook,
- tells you how German you are.
- Oh, right.
- Like Ancestry dot--yeah.
- No.
Oh, I thought it was like a score that you get from eating a ton of sauerklout on, uh, like, a bratwurst.
- Okay, we got this, then.
- Sure.
No.
Klout is this super-chill metric that tells you your social impact across all platforms.
Whoo, we talking Klout?
'Cause I got Klout like a mug.
Okay, I'm a beast on Black Twitter,

- Mm.
Then I bust out a bunch of hilarious tweets, and I stay getting faves.
Heck yeah.
Okay.

Yeah, and you are tuned into our YouTube page.
- So welcome.

Let's introduce ourselves, I guess.
- Okay.
- Okay, yeah.
My name's Anders.
Call me Ders, though.
Um, who am I?
I'm like--
I guess I'm like a country club bad boy, right?
And, uh, I enjoy Phil Collins hits and Tom Collins mix.
Also, I slam 40s and listen to Ty Dolla sign, though.
So, like, I'm like a cornucopia of fun.
Okay.
- Sick.
Great job.
- All right.
Really, that was solid.
Okay, yeah, hey.
What's up?
It's Blake, the hair one.
Okay, um, yeah.
I'm just, like, a super-chill laid-back dude, jokester kind of guy, but also, like,
I get, like, really, like, stressed and, like, total-- have, like, anxiety in most social situations.
Next person.
Please, please.
Go.
Go.
Bail me out.
Bail me out.
Yo, what up?
It's Ad-Rock, yeah, boy!
Um, I like, uh--
I like, uh, doing all kinds of stuff.
I like getting weird, and I like working out.
And sometimes I like just chilling and not working out.
And sometimes I, like, smash, like, 42 beers.
And other times I'll just, you know, just have--just have two, like a-a nice stout.
- Sick.
- Cool.
- And, uh, again, we are...
- Nailed it.
- All: @The3BestFrandz.
- Okay.
- With an A.
- Hashtag.
Thanks for watching.
Tickle.
Hey, don't!
- You did great.
- You were good.
- Honestly, really good stuff.
- I was good.
Thank you.
And so was I, though, you can--
It goes around.
It goes around.
All right, Tres Delinquentes.
What does that say right there?
- Two views.
- Yeah.
It says people are not engaging with your brands.
You've got to focus more on curating your individual personas.
I mean, Blake, you're a super-chill millennial teen, so don't go around telling me that you've got anxiety.
Now go bust out some super-chill rando vids on Snapchat with this rad land paddleboard.
Oh, all right.
Yeah.
- I like that.
That's cool.
- Yeah.
So we're selling these now?
He is.
You're selling 9/11 memorabilia because you are a mature all-American conservative.
You are human khakis.
Yeah, I mean, 9/11.
Love it, but Ty Dolla sign...
Forget about Ty Dolla sign.
Never forget about 9/11.
Sure, yeah.
So now go jump on Linkedln.
Link out with your dink out.
- Sick.
- Okay, now do me.
Do me.
Have you ever heard of a man named Dan Bilzerian?
Dan Bilzerian?
From Instagram?
He's like-- he's like--isn't he-- he's like my hero.
I freakin' carry a photo of him in my pocket.
He's just scratching his beard.
"What am I thinking of?"
I'll tell you what he's thinking of:
pussy, money, respect.
Yeah.
And I got all those things.
Except for I don't.
I'm lying to you.
I'm-I'm actually pretty lonely.

Careful.

- Okay.

Let's be sure and tag each other, so we can stack some hits, and then whoever's got the most Klout takes the other two people to Havasu.
- That's smart.

You are inviting us, though, right?
Yeah.
Hold up, though.

Oh, that's me.

I'm so excited to be following @Dersmerica and @YungChillunerr and @AdamnBilzarian.
I, like, can't wait to see what you guys do.
I'm on, like, everything social media, so follow me back.
- Awesome, very cool.
- Get out of my way!
- Oh, ouch!
- Bill, what's wrong with you?
- Ouch, Bill.
- My Klout Score.
Everything was going so well.
I had 20 followers on Twitter, then got 45 likes on a meme I posted on IG.
And then I got cocky and tried Periscope.
Cocky Periscope.
Yeah, I've heard of that.
It's when you pull your cocky out and put it through the sunroof of a moving vehicle.
- Mm-hmm.
- Right?
Is it?
No, it's livestreaming video.
- So not what I said.
- No.
- That's cool, though.
- Okay.
It's livestreaming video.
And I accidentally yelled the F word and not even in a mean way.
I was just talking about gay people.
Now I'm ruined.

You think I'm a celeb?
Totes McGoats, man.
You've been cranking out some epic content.
Appreciate it.

- Uh, then check it.
This is the EZ Egger.
Ooh, I like it.
Impressive.
What's--what does it do?
It makes cooking eggs up to 65% easier.
- Uh, yeah.
- Eggs are tough.
I'm not sure that's on brand for me, bro.
Yeah, my flock doesn't like to cut corners, so count me out.
Yeah, it--it really doesn't matter at this point, man.
I mean, your followers should buy whatever you tell them.
That's why they're called followers.
- Okay.
- Yeah.

Hey, you guys need to clear out of here.
I'm gonna film a new Instagram video where
I karate chop my head through a vodka-infused candied ham.
I'm calling it a "feast of strength."
No, you can't, because I'm about to christen this the "Ronald Reagan Memorial Break Room," so...
Mmm, no, you guys are gonna have to leave.
But luckily for you, you bought yourself a few extra minutes because I have to go poo-poo.
- All right.
- Go take a Blake.
I'll be back.
Yeah, don't forget to wipe your--
Uh, what are you?
Andy?
I don't know what you're calling yourself, you idiot.
You wish.
Hey, uh, noticed you hadn't connected with me on Linkedln.
So if you could do that, that'd be great.
Thanks.
Linkedln is for lame old try-hards.
Are you calling me old?
Hey, never forget 9/11.
Also, never forget how old you really are.
Oh.

Oh, let me see your ID, 'cause I'm pretty sure it reads Anders.
Hmm?
Doesn't sound very American to me, does it?
You freakin' birther.

Let's see a birth certificate.
Oh, well, let's see what your real name is.
It's Anders--
- All right, time's up.
There is no way you wiped your butt.
Uh, yeah, no, I didn't have to wipe, because it came out in just one-- it just fell right out.
- Time to freakin' go.
- You know what?
Both you guys suck.
I'm gonna stack some Klout points and go to Havasu solo.
Oh, my gosh.
I can't believe you're all together IRL.
Uh, could I get a quick selfie for Facebook?
- Uh...
- Me in a photo with these guys?
I don't think so.
Yeah, but you guys are the @The3BestFrandz.
Uh, not anymore.
I can't be in a picture with these guys.
It's just-- wouldn't make sense, really.
Well, but I'm a Blaker Girl, and I'm an Adam Madam.
- And I'm Randy for Andy.
- That's not his real name.
- I can't choose one.
- Well, you kind of have to.
- Yeah.
- Don't be stupid.
It's whoever's best at social media.
- Pick one of us right now.
- Please don't do this to me!
- Just choose one!

- You pick one of us!

Hey, Son.
Have you seen my EZ Egger?
Uh, no.
Why don't you check your butt, where you keep everything else, Dad?

Okay.

How unfortunate to hear about all the Internet backlash, but I suppose the truth was going to rear its ugly head sooner or later.
Okay, cut the camera.
Yeah, right.
What are you talking about?
Well, I guess someone leaked a pic of your birth certificate and posted it on Vine.
Oops.
Karl, give me my phone.

Wait, you can't--
I hate you, Ders!
I hate you!
I got to go, Karl.
- I got to go.
- Okay.
Okay.
Oh, hey, are you gonna eat these eggs?
Okay, going to the 60-second rule.
It's all me, baby.
Hope you're happy, Andy, because my Klout Score is ruined.
Oh, give it a rest, Henderson.
You know you brought this hellfire down on both of us.
Doesn't matter anymore.
Neither of us are going to Lake Havasu now.
Oh, well, maybe Adam can go.
Yeah, maybe I could go if Instagram didn't just shut down my account.
- What?
- Oh, so you sabotaged him too.
Don't give me too much credit.
I wish I did that.
That's--that's not what happened.
I tried to hold a contest for sickest tank pic of the day, and then this girl, she showed me, uh, a pic of her jambos.
And so I was like, this deserves more than a repost, which was going to be the prize.
both:
Right.
But I know how chicks work.
It's tick for tack.
She wanted to see the D. You know what I mean?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
So I sent her a picture of my dick, and instead of sending it to her,
I posted it on the Instagram.
- Oh, you're on blast.
- Uh-oh.
I mean, I still got the jambo pic.
You want to see it?
both:
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Those are sweater pups.
- Oh, nice.
- They're good, right?
They're good.
They're my cousin Tracy's.
They are nice.
Shwha?
Hmm?
Oh.
Okay.
I'm sorry.
I didn't know that when I sent the dick pic.
I should've known, because I know those tits.
- Yeah.
- DeMamps.
We're known for our giant titties.
- Some of the men too.
- Guys.
Hey, guys.
Question.
What happened to us?
I mean, look at-- this is insane.
We're not these dumb brands, right?
- Right.
- I know it, man.
I mean, we used to just be three best friends who liked looking at, you know, big ol' chumbawumbas.
We're just horny, horny titty boys.
Would've seen a lot of them in Havasu.
But we're not going.
That's right.
All the stepmoms with the pasties on speedboats getting turnt up?
- Bye-bye.
- And birdwatching.
And the birdwatching.
Wait a second.
There's one more thing we can do.
It'll get our Klout Scores right through the roof.
But if we mess it up,
I'm serious when I say we can never show our faces on the Internet ever again.
Tell us.

Yep.
Yeah.

How many of you are sick of pretending you're someone you aren't just to get followers?
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.
For example, Ghostman.
We all know that you're not in a biker gang, man.
You had a poem published in the newspaper last week.
That was my wife's obituary.
- Yes.
- Oh.
And then, Waymond, you're not Redfoo.
No one wants to party rock at your house tonight.
Take off those stupid [bleep] glasses.
You look like an idiot.
And by golly, the same goes for you, Diane.
You don't have to carry around the stereotypical Chinese geisha fan to get followers, okay?

I'm not sure what you said, but delete whatever he told you to be, okay?
Delete that.
Feel good.
- She--she gets it.
- Yep.
Here's the main target, right here.
- Tez, my man, what's up, dude?
- Hey.
- Come on.
- Right.
You got to quit faking the funk, bro, because we know who you are.
And you don't got to do all this to rule Black Twitter, okay?
- You're working a little hard.
- Yeah, you're complex, dude.
You're more than just, you know, what we're looking at here.
- Right.
- You're right, Blake.
Get this gold off of my neck.
And you know what?
I'm going speed skating after work.
And if anybody got a problem with it, you can kiss my aerodynamic, bodysuit-wearing, natural black, hairy ass.
- All right.
- There's a visual.
Very disgusting.
We don't want to do that.
- Okay, yeah.
- But thank you.
Deleting all this bull[bleep].
Hey, I don't know about you guys, but I'm sick of worrying about my followers, and I'm ready to care about my friends, all right?
Yeah.
I'm sick of pretending to be a brand for likes.
Yeah.
I'm not a brand.
I'm a man.
- And we are men!
- Yep.
- And some of us are women.
- Yeah.
Not brands.
- Delete your apps!
- Yes.
All:
Delete your apps!
Delete your apps!
Okay.
All right.
Okay, okay, everybody.
all:
Delete your apps!

- Uh, Alice?
Alice, seems like this is getting a little out of control?
Nah, the Internet is garbage.
Garbage?
Okay, great.
Well, you can just tell corporate that you hate the future.
Oh, or why don't I tell corporate that ever since you signed these knuckleheads up for the "Internet,"
we haven't had a single sale?
- Delete your apps!
- Yeah!
- All:
Delete your apps!
- Yeah!

All right, fine.

- Oh, sh...
- What'd you do?
- Ah, I just shot it!
- Oh, direct hit!
- What?
No, no, no.
Hit it right in the face, right in the beak.
- Oh, God, we got to save it.
- We got to save her.
- Yeah, no, it's gargling.
- No, we have to save her.
- It's gargling.
- Dude, Blake.
Hey, whoa, whoa.
- Stop, man, it's too late.

Just look at these news boobies.

Yeah, so I was just thinking, maybe at lunch we could do the proper Magic Johnson hook shot burial, you know, since he went out like that.
Yeah, but he died in a pool.
- There's honor in that.
- Poor little dude.
Actually, I don't even know if it's a dude because, you know, bird dicks are notoriously hard to locate.
I've been looking all morning.
I've actually spent my childhood locating bird dicks.
- Really?
- You guys do that.
- I'm gonna do anything else.
- You've got to pinch it.
- Yeah.
- Hold that.
- You got to pinch it.
- Ah.
They call me Trilly Zane.
Am I the guy that took Rancho Cuca Pizza's
Twitter followers from 200 to 2,100 in 13 months?
Have I left over 20,000 Yelp reviews?
Do I DM with Rainn Wilson on the reg?
You bet your SoulPancakes I do.
I have no idea what this guy's talking about, but he seems... pretty cool.
I came here to do two things... destroy old media paradigms and increase sales using the power of viral marketing.
And it looks like we're almost out of old media paradigms.
[laughter] Was that funny?
- Oh.
- I don't know.
But I thought it was an appropriate time to laugh.
- Hey, who is that guy?
- He's really funny.
What?
Oh, it's me.
- Whoa!
- All:
Oh!
Oh, you're the guy from the video that we just watched.
- I just got...
- It's me.
Trilly Zane.
- Hey, what up?
- Oh, yeah, pound it.
- Very cool.
- Yeah, no doubt.
No doubt.
- Definitely, cool.
- Oh, okay.
I'll take one.
Boom.
Sorry to crash the party, but as you know, millennials are a huge emerging demo.
- Yeah, I've heard that.
- I get that, yeah.
For sure, millennials.
And they're jacked into their devices 24/7, so that means we got to get you guys up on all the socials, blasting out content, jacking up hits, stacking up followers.
Jacking and stacking, baby.
And then convert all those followers into sales.
And that sounds pretty dope, right?
There is also all-expenses-paid work trip to the Virality Awards in Lake Havasu to whoever has the highest Klout Score.
- Havasu?
Oh, my God.
Dude!
- Lake Havasu, right?
You're talking about the place where basically it's all stepmoms with pasties on their boobs...
Okay.
Cruising on speedboats, getting turnt?
Yeah.
Nothing but energy drinks and freakin' plan B pills, baby!
That's the kind of life I want to live!
- Okay.
- My plan A is plan B.
- Uh-oh.
- Oh!
- Y'all forgot something.
- The birds.
Great birdwatching.
Yeah, the... uh, yeah, I guess, sure.
Wait, uh, Klout Score?
How do we get to Havasu?
Oh, oh, I know what it is.
It's like a test you take on Facebook,
- tells you how German you are.
- Oh, right.
- Like Ancestry dot... yeah.
- No.
Oh, I thought it was like a score that you get from eating a ton of sauerklout on, uh, like, a bratwurst.
- Okay, we got this, then.
- Sure.
No.
Klout is this super-chill metric that tells you your social impact across all platforms.
- Whoo, we talking Klout?
- 'Cause I got Klout like a mug.
Okay, I'm a beast on Black Twitter,
- like #bootyhadmelikehoo.
- Mm.
Then I bust out a bunch of hilarious tweets, and I stay getting faves.
Heck yeah.
Okay.
Tez, on fleek.
Tez is on fleek.
You look like human banana pudding.
Stay fleeking.
- Okay, buddy, let's go.
- Okay, ready?
- We are the @3BestFrandz.
- 3BestFrandz.
Yeah, and you are tuned into our YouTube page.
- So welcome.
- That's right.
Let's introduce ourselves, I guess.
- Okay.
- Okay, yeah.
My name's Anders.
Call me Ders, though.
Um, who am I?
I'm like...
I guess I'm like a country club bad boy, right?
And, uh, I enjoy Phil Collins hits and Tom Collins mix.
Also, I slam 40s and listen to Ty Dolla $ign, though.
So, like, I'm like a cornucopia of fun.
Okay.
- Sick.
Great job.
- All right.
Really, that was solid.
Okay, yeah, hey.
What's up?
It's Blake, the hair one.
Okay, um, yeah.
I'm just, like, a super-chill laid-back dude, jokester kind of guy, but also, like,
I get, like, really, like, stressed and, like, total... have, like, anxiety in most social situations.
Next person.
Please, please.
Go.
Go.
Bail me out.
Bail me out.
Yo, what up?
It's Ad-Rock, yeah, boy!
Um, I like, uh...
I like, uh, doing all kinds of stuff.
I like getting weird, and I like working out.
And sometimes I like just chilling and not working out.
And sometimes I, like, smash, like, 42 beers.
And other times I'll just, you know, just have... just have two, like a-a nice stout.
- Sick.
- Cool.
- And, uh, again, we are...
- Nailed it.
- All: @The3BestFrandz.
- Okay.
- With an A.
- Hashtag.
Thanks for watching.
Tickle.
Hey, don't!
- You did great.
- You were good.
- Honestly, really good stuff.
- I was good.
Thank you.
And so was I, though, you can...
- It goes around.
- It goes around.
All right, Tres Delinquentes.
What does that say right there?
- Two views.
- Yeah.
It says people are not engaging with your brands.
You've got to focus more on curating your individual personas.
I mean, Blake, you're a super-chill millennial teen, so don't go around telling me that you've got anxiety.
Now go bust out some super-chill rando vids on Snapchat with this rad land paddleboard.
Oh, all right.
Yeah.
- I like that.
That's cool.
- Yeah.
So we're selling these now?
He is.
You're selling 9/11 memorabilia because you are a mature all-American conservative.
You are human khakis.
Yeah, I mean, 9/11.
Love it, but Ty Dolla $ign...
Forget about Ty Dolla $ign.
Never forget about 9/11.
Sure, yeah.
So now go jump on LinkedIn.
Link out with your dink out.
- Sick.
- Okay, now do me.
Do me.
Have you ever heard of a man named Dan Bilzerian?
Dan Bilzerian?
From Instagram?
He's like... he's like... isn't he... he's like my hero.
I freakin' carry a photo of him in my pocket.
He's just scratching his beard.
"What am I thinking of?"
I'll tell you what he's thinking of:
pussy, money, respect.
Yeah.
And I got all those things.
Except for I don't.
I'm lying to you.
I'm-I'm actually pretty lonely.
- This is The Sleeve Cleaver.
- [gasps]
It'll take any shirt and turn it into a tank top in less than a second.
Okay, I'm not just gonna sell this.
I'm gonna devote my life to it.
- Okay?
- I love it.
Careful.
- They will cut your fingers off.
- Okay.
[beatboxing] [beatboxing]
Let's be sure and tag each other, so we can stack some hits, and then whoever's got the most Klout takes the other two people to Havasu.
- That's smart.
- Lake Havasu?
More like "Blake, be there soon."
[laughter]
You are inviting us, though, right?
- Yeah.
Hold up, though.
- Check your phones.
[cell phones chime]
Oh, my God.
You followed me.
- I feel all warm and fuzzy.
- Hey, and guess what.
You guys just got another follower.
- Who?
[gasps] Ders.
- Yeah.
[cell phone chimes] I didn't get it yet.
- You sent it?
- Whoa, I just got a follower.
Who's @SilliestJilly?
Oh, that's me.
That's me.
I'm so excited to be following @Dersmerica and @YungChillunerr and @AdamnBilzarian.
I, like, can't wait to see what you guys do.
I'm on, like, everything social media, so follow me back.
- Awesome, very cool.
- Get out of my way!
- Oh, ouch!
- Bill, what's wrong with you?
- Ouch, Bill.
- My Klout Score.
Everything was going so well.
I had 20 followers on Twitter, then got 45 likes on a meme I posted on IG.
And then I got cocky and tried Periscope.
- Cocky Periscope.
- Yeah, I've heard of that.
It's when you pull your cocky out and put it through the sunroof of a moving vehicle.
- Mm-hmm.
- Right?
Is it?
No, it's livestreaming video.
- So not what I said.
- No.
- That's cool, though.
- Okay.
It's livestreaming video.
And I accidentally yelled the F word and not even in a mean way.
I was just talking about gay people.
Now I'm ruined.
- Poor guy.
- [cell phone chimes]
Note to self... don't try Periscope.
Check it out... my dumbass dad fell asleep while waiting to pick me up from school.

You guys want a hit off my Strawberry Latte Bull?
No, no, no, I'm just gonna drink the Red Bull.
And coffee here.
Whatever.
Don't care.
There's my boys,
Rancho's three biggest web celebs.
You think I'm a celeb?
Totes McGoats, man.
You've been cranking out some epic content.
Appreciate it.
So you ready to leverage your brand outside of your core demo?
- [chuckles]
- Sure.
- You tell me.
- Uh, then check it.
This is the EZ Egger.
Ooh, I like it.
Impressive.
What's... what does it do?
It makes cooking eggs up to 65% easier.
- Uh, yeah.
- Eggs are tough.
I'm not sure that's on brand for me, bro.
Yeah, my flock doesn't like to cut corners, so count me out.
Yeah, it... it really doesn't matter at this point, man.
I mean, your followers should buy whatever you tell them.
That's why they're called followers.
- Okay.
- Yeah.
That's why they're called followers.
- Yeah.
- Is it...
Where's my coconut water?
I told corporate this was non-negosh.
- Alice!
- Alice!
- He's pissed.
- Man, later.
Trilly's...
Trilly's the best.
Hey, you guys need to clear out of here.
I'm gonna film a new Instagram video where
I karate chop my head through a vodka-infused candied ham.
I'm calling it a "feast of strength."
No, you can't, because I'm about to christen this the "Ronald Reagan Memorial Break Room," so...
Mmm, no, you guys are gonna have to leave.
But luckily for you, you bought yourself a few extra minutes because I have to go poo-poo.
- All right.
- Go take a Blake.
I'll be back.
Yeah, don't forget to wipe your...
Uh, what are you?
Andy?
I don't know what you're calling yourself, you idiot.
You wish.
Hey, uh, noticed you hadn't connected with me on LinkedIn.
So if you could do that, that'd be great.
Thanks.
LinkedIn is for lame old try-hards.
Are you calling me old?
Hey, never forget 9/11.
Also, never forget how old you really are.
Oh.
I want to see a birth certificate.
Oh, let me see your ID, 'cause I'm pretty sure it reads Anders.
Hmm?
Doesn't sound very American to me, does it?
You freakin' birther.
- I'm American.
- Let's see a birth certificate.
Oh, well, let's see what your real name is.
- It's Anders...
- All right, time's up.
There is no way you wiped your butt.
Uh, yeah, no, I didn't have to wipe, because it came out in just one... it just fell right out.
- Time to freakin' go.
- You know what?
Both you guys suck.
I'm gonna stack some Klout points and go to Havasu solo.
Oh, my gosh.
I can't believe you're all together IRL.
Uh, could I get a quick selfie for Facebook?
- Uh...
- Me in a photo with these guys?
I don't think so.
Yeah, but you guys are the @The3BestFrandz.
Uh, not anymore.
I can't be in a picture with these guys.
It's just...
wouldn't make sense, really.
Well, but I'm a Blaker Girl, and I'm an Adam Madam.
- And I'm Randy for Andy.
- That's not his real name.
- I can't choose one.
- Well, you kind of have to.
- Yeah.
- Don't be stupid.
It's whoever's best at social media.
- Pick one of us right now.
- Please don't do this to me!
- Just choose one!
- What are we doing?
- You pick one of us!
- Gosh damn it, boys!
What are we gonna do come Christmas?
I loved you!
All of you!

America.
Farmers, chickens, eggs.
The foundation of life, regardless of whatever Planned Parenthood tells you.
But I always say, when life tries to hard-boil you, just hard-boil eggs in under three minutes with the EZ Egger.
Real hard-boiled eggs.
That's good.
God bless America.
Get ready to soar once again.
- Ah!
- Oh!
Oh, that old yuppie just hit a baby bald eagle!
[laughs]
Who did that?
What was that?
Remember to follow me, YungChillunerr on Snapchat.
I see you!
You know how it is.
You're vaped out of your mind.
You're starving.
You got the munchies.
All you want is some cooked eggs, but to make them is... freakin' hard.
[chuckles] It sucks, but not anymore.
Now it's really easy.
Hey, Son.
Have you seen my EZ Egger?
Uh, no.
Why don't you check your butt, where you keep everything else, Dad?
EZ Egger.
Okay.
Shyeah. [chuckles] [dramatic music] [sighs]
How unfortunate to hear about all the Internet backlash, but I suppose the truth was going to rear its ugly head sooner or later.
Okay, cut the camera.
Yeah, right.
What are you talking about?
Well, I guess someone leaked a pic of your birth certificate and posted it on Vine.
Oops.
Karl, give me my phone.
[cell phone chimes]
Wait, you can't...
I hate you, Ders!
I hate you!
I got to go, Karl.
- I got to go.
- Okay.
Okay.
Oh, hey, are you gonna eat these eggs?
Okay, going to the 60-second rule.
It's all me, baby.
Hope you're happy, Andy, because my Klout Score is ruined.
Oh, give it a rest, Henderson.
You know you brought this hellfire down on both of us.
Doesn't matter anymore.
Neither of us are going to Lake Havasu now.
Oh, well, maybe Adam can go.
Yeah, maybe I could go if Instagram didn't just shut down my account.
- What?
- Oh, so you sabotaged him too.
Don't give me too much credit.
I wish I did that.
That's... that's not what happened.
I tried to hold a contest for sickest tank pic of the day, and then this girl, she showed me, uh, a pic of her jambos.
And so I was like, this deserves more than a repost,
- which was going to be the prize.
- both:
Right.
But I know how chicks work.
It's tick for tack.
She wanted to see the D. You know what I mean?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
So I sent her a picture of my dick, and instead of sending it to her,
I posted it on the Instagram.
- Oh, you're on blast.
- Uh-oh.
I mean, I still got the jambo pic.
- You want to see it?
- Both:
Yeah.
- Oh, yeah.
- Those are sweater pups.
- Oh, nice.
- They're good, right?
They're good.
They're my cousin Tracy's.
They are nice.
Shwha?
Hmm?
Oh.
Okay.
I'm sorry.
I didn't know that when I sent the dick pic.
I should've known, because I know those tits.
- Yeah.
- DeMamps.
We're known for our giant titties.
- Some of the men too.
- Guys.
Hey, guys.
Question.
What happened to us?
I mean, look at... this is insane.
We're not these dumb brands, right?
- Right.
- I know it, man.
I mean, we used to just be three best friends who liked looking at, you know, big ol' chumbawumbas.
We're just horny, horny titty boys.
Would've seen a lot of them in Havasu.
But we're not going.
That's right.
All the stepmoms with the pasties on speedboats getting turnt up?
- Bye-bye.
- And birdwatching.
And the birdwatching.
Wait a second.
There's one more thing we can do.
It'll get our Klout Scores right through the roof.
But if we mess it up,
I'm serious when I say we can never show our faces on the Internet ever again.
Tell us.
Both:
Periscope.
Yep.
Yeah.
You guys get the car with the moonroof, and I'll be ready to hang my thang.
I'm having a big day, actually.
- But we don't need...
- Yeah.
It doesn't...
- Just let him do it.
- Yeah.
What's going on?
Maybe one of you guys can do it.
[beatboxing]
[beatboxing]
All right.
What's up?
All right, everybody.
We're gonna get back to the craft beers and vegan hot dogs in a hot sec.
But real quick, just want to officially announce the TAC Social Media Brandbassador with the highest Klout Score who's gonna be rolling deep with me to the Virality Awards in Lake Havasu.
Say my name!
Everybody!
Not so fast, punk!
Yo, yo, yo.
It's @The3BestFrandz, coming to you live on Periscope!
- Hi!
- Ah!
We've got something to tell you guys.
How many of you are sick of pretending you're someone you aren't just to get followers?
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.
For example, Ghostman.
We all know that you're not in a biker gang, man.
You had a poem published in the newspaper last week.
That was my wife's obituary.
- Yes.
- Oh.
And then, Waymond, you're not Redfoo.
No one wants to party rock at your house tonight.
Take off those stupid [bleep] glasses.
You look like an idiot.
And by golly, the same goes for you, Diane.
You don't have to carry around the stereotypical Chinese geisha fan to get followers, okay?
[speaking native language]
I'm not sure what you said, but delete whatever he told you to be, okay?
Delete that.
Feel good.
- She... she gets it.
- Yep.
Here's the main target, right here.
- Tez, my man, what's up, dude?
- Hey.
- Come on.
- Right.
You got to quit faking the funk, bro, because we know who you are.
And you don't got to do all this to rule Black Twitter, okay?
- You're working a little hard.
- Yeah, you're complex, dude.
You're more than just, you know, what we're looking at here.
- Right.
- You're right, Blake.
Get this gold off of my neck.
And you know what?
I'm going speed skating after work.
And if anybody got a problem with it, you can kiss my aerodynamic, bodysuit-wearing, natural black, hairy ass.
- All right.
- There's a visual.
- Very disgusting.
- We don't want to do that.
- Okay, yeah.
- But thank you.
Deleting all this bull[bleep].
Hey, I don't know about you guys, but I'm sick of worrying about my followers, and I'm ready to care about my friends, all right?
Yeah.
I'm sick of pretending to be a brand for likes.
Yeah.
I'm not a brand.
I'm a man.
- And we are men!
- Yep.
- And some of us are women.
- Yeah.
Not brands.
- Delete your apps!
- Yes.
All:
Delete your apps!
Delete your apps!
Okay.
All right.
Okay, okay, everybody.
All:
Delete your apps!
- Delete...
- Uh, Alice?
Alice, seems like this is getting a little out of control?
Nah, the Internet is garbage.
- Garbage?
- Okay, great.
Well, you can just tell corporate that you hate the future.
Oh, or why don't I tell corporate that ever since you signed these knuckleheads up for the "Internet,"
we haven't had a single sale?
- Delete your apps!
- Yeah!
- All:
Delete your apps!
- Yeah!
- All:
Delete your apps!
- All right.
All right, fine.
- All:
Delete your apps!
- You know what?
I was gonna give y'all a beta invite to B.J. Novak's new app, but you can forget about it.
Hey, there's still one score left.

- We're going to Havasu, baby!

Oh, yeah.
Mmm.

And then I'm just gonna pulse it, pulse it, pulse it.
Bam, done.
Okay.
Who wants a Strawberry Latte Bull?
What is that?
Well, it's our three favorite morning beverages.
I'm talking strawberry Quik, decaf coffee, and Red Bull.
- Adam?
- Okay.
Please.
No, not while I'm handling firearms, which are what I'm calling my arms now 'cause my muscles are on fire from all this sling-shooting.
- Whatever.
- Ders, first up.
- Okay.
- There you go, buddy.
- Nice and frothy.
Mmm.

- Mmm.
- Mm-mm.
Mm-mm?
What?
- Not good at all.
- Not good?
- That's surprising.
- That's... yeah.
But I'm gonna choke this one down because it is symbolic of our friendship.
And that's why you are the quarterback
- of our friendship.
- Okay.
So this is what the world's coming to.
Oh, my gosh, this is what the world's coming to.
That's what the world's coming to.
Mm-hmm.
- News boobies.
- Yeah.
I couldn't to that if I tried.
- Mm.
- And I have, actually.
I used to jerk off to a Sears catalog all the time.
Or was it JCPenney's?
Could have been Cabela's, but the chicks were super hot.
- Similar... similar vibes.
- Mm.
Cabela babe.
Oh, sh...
- What'd you do?
- Ah, I just shot it!
- Oh, direct hit!
- What?
No, no, no.
Hit it right in the face, right in the beak.
- Oh, God, we got to save it.
- We got to save her.
- Yeah, no, it's gargling.
- No, we have to save her.

Hey, whoa, whoa.
- Stop, man, it's too late.

Yeah, so I was just thinking, maybe at lunch we could do the proper Magic Johnson hook shot burial, you know, since he went out like that.

- Whoa!
- Oh!
Oh, you're the guy from the video that we just watched.
- I just got...
- It's me.
Trilly Zane.
- Hey, what up?
- Oh, yeah, pound it.
- Very cool.
- Yeah, no doubt.
No doubt.
- Definitely, cool.
- Oh, okay.
I'll take one.
Boom.
Sorry to crash the party, but as you know, millennials are a huge emerging demo.
- Yeah, I've heard that.
- I get that, yeah.
For sure, millennials.
And they're jacked into their devices 24/7, so that means we got to get you guys up on all the socials, blasting out content, jacking up hits, stacking up followers.
Jacking and stacking, baby.
And then convert all those followers into sales.
And that sounds pretty dope, right?
There is also all-expenses-paid work trip to the Virality Awards in Lake Havasu to whoever has the highest Klout Score.
- Havasu?
Oh, my God.
Dude!
- Lake Havasu, right?
You're talking about the place where basically it's all stepmoms with pasties on their boobs...
Okay.
Cruising on speedboats, getting turnt?
Yeah.
Nothing but energy drinks and freakin' plan B pills, baby!
That's the kind of life I want to live!
- Okay.
- My plan A is plan B.
- Uh-oh.
- Oh!
- Y'all forgot something.
- The birds.
Great birdwatching.
Yeah, the... uh, yeah, I guess, sure.
Wait, uh, Klout Score?
How do we get to Havasu?
Oh, oh, I know what it is.
It's like a test you take on Facebook,
- tells you how German you are.
- Oh, right.
- Like Ancestry dot... yeah.
- No.
Oh, I thought it was like a score that you get from eating a ton of sauerklout on, uh, like, a bratwurst.
- Okay, we got this, then.
- Sure.
No.
Klout is this super-chill metric that tells you your social impact across all platforms.
- Whoo, we talking Klout?
- 'Cause I got Klout like a mug.
Okay, I'm a beast on Black Twitter,
- like #bootyhadmelikehoo.
- Mm.
Then I bust out a bunch of hilarious tweets, and I stay getting faves.
Heck yeah.
Okay.
Tez, on fleek.
Tez is on fleek.
You look like human banana pudding.
Stay fleeking.
- Okay, buddy, let's go.
- Okay, ready?
- We are the @3BestFrandz.
- 3BestFrandz.
Yeah, and you are tuned into our YouTube page.
- So welcome.
- That's right.
Let's introduce ourselves, I guess.
- Okay.
- Okay, yeah.
My name's Anders.
Call me Ders, though.
Um, who am I?
I'm like...
I guess I'm like a country club bad boy, right?
And, uh, I enjoy Phil Collins hits and Tom Collins mix.
Also, I slam 40s and listen to Ty Dolla $ign, though.
So, like, I'm like a cornucopia of fun.
Okay.
- Sick.
Great job.
- All right.
Really, that was solid.
Okay, yeah, hey.
What's up?
It's Blake, the hair one.
Okay, um, yeah.
I'm just, like, a super-chill laid-back dude, jokester kind of guy, but also, like,
I get, like, really, like, stressed and, like, total... have, like, anxiety in most social situations.
Next person.
Please, please.
Go.
Go.
Bail me out.
Bail me out.
Yo, what up?
It's Ad-Rock, yeah, boy!
Um, I like, uh...
I like, uh, doing all kinds of stuff.
I like getting weird, and I like working out.
And sometimes I like just chilling and not working out.
And sometimes I, like, smash, like, 42 beers.
And other times I'll just, you know, just have... just have two, like a-a nice stout.
- Sick.
- Cool.
- And, uh, again, we are...
- Nailed it.
- @The3BestFrandz.
- Okay.
- With an A.
- Hashtag.
Thanks for watching.
Tickle.
Hey, don't!
- You did great.
- You were good.
- Honestly, really good stuff.
- I was good.
Thank you.
And so was I, though, you can...
- It goes around.
- It goes around.
All right, Tres Delinquentes.
What does that say right there?
- Two views.
- Yeah.
It says people are not engaging with your brands.
You've got to focus more on curating your individual personas.
I mean, Blake, you're a super-chill millennial teen, so don't go around telling me that you've got anxiety.
Now go bust out some super-chill rando vids on Snapchat with this rad land paddleboard.
Oh, all right.
Yeah.
- I like that.
That's cool.
- Yeah.
So we're selling these now?
He is.
You're selling 9/11 memorabilia because you are a mature all-American conservative.
You are human khakis.
Yeah, I mean, 9/11.
Love it, but Ty Dolla $ign...
Forget about Ty Dolla $ign.
Never forget about 9/11.
Sure, yeah.
So now go jump on LinkedIn.
Link out with your dink out.
- Sick.
- Okay, now do me.
Do me.
Have you ever heard of a man named Dan Bilzerian?
Dan Bilzerian?
From Instagram?
He's like... he's like... isn't he... he's like my hero.
I freakin' carry a photo of him in my pocket.
He's just scratching his beard.
"What am I thinking of?"
I'll tell you what he's thinking of:
pussy, money, respect.
Yeah.
And I got all those things.
Except for I don't.
I'm lying to you.
I'm-I'm actually pretty lonely.
This is The Sleeve Cleaver.
It'll take any shirt and turn it into a tank top in less than a second.
Okay, I'm not just gonna sell this.
I'm gonna devote my life to it.
- Okay?
- I love it.
Careful.
- They will cut your fingers off.
- Okay.
Let's be sure and tag each other, so we can stack some hits, and then whoever's got the most Klout takes the other two people to Havasu.
- That's smart.
- Lake Havasu?
More like "Blake, be there soon."
You are inviting us, though, right?
- Yeah.
Hold up, though.
- Check your phones.
Oh, my God.
You followed me.
- I feel all warm and fuzzy.
- Hey, and guess what.
You guys just got another follower.
- Who?
Ders.
- Yeah.
I didn't get it yet.
- You sent it?
- Whoa, I just got a follower.
Who's @SilliestJilly?
Oh, that's me.
That's me.
I'm so excited to be following @Dersmerica and @YungChillunerr and @AdamnBilzarian.
I, like, can't wait to see what you guys do.
I'm on, like, everything social media, so follow me back.
- Awesome, very cool.
- Get out of my way!
- Oh, ouch!
- Bill, what's wrong with you?
- Ouch, Bill.
- My Klout Score.
Everything was going so well.
I had 20 followers on Twitter, then got 45 likes on a meme I posted on IG.
And then I got cocky and tried Periscope.
- Cocky Periscope.
- Yeah, I've heard of that.
It's when you pull your cocky out and put it through the sunroof of a moving vehicle.
- Mm-hmm.
- Right?
Is it?
No, it's livestreaming video.
- So not what I said.
- No.
- That's cool, though.
- Okay.
It's livestreaming video.
And I accidentally yelled the F word and not even in a mean way.
I was just talking about gay people.
Now I'm ruined.
Poor guy.
Note to self... don't try Periscope.
Check it out... my dumbass dad fell asleep while waiting to pick me up from school.
We're about to clown this fool.
... Oh!
Oh!
God damn it, Son!
Suck it, Dad.
Sorry, not sorry.
God, you stupid... you're so stupid, @YungChillunerr.
You're so stupid, @YungChillunerr.
Okay, just say it once.
Psst.
Hey, Brenda!
Hold this.
- Did you get it?
- Yep, yep, yep.
- Follow me, @AdamnBilzarian.
- Got it.
Let's go.
- Instagram.
- Got it.
Got it.
Go.
Go.
America.
It's an idea.
Bootstraps.
The call of an eagle.
We're not France.
We like French fries, though.
"Star-Spangled Banner."
Purple magic mountain majesty.
I don't even know what it means, but I salute it.
Chinese, Japanese, dirty knees, look at these.
Sure, it sounds Asian, but I guarantee you it was written by an American.
That's what I'm talking about.
When I pop this balloon with my sling-shoot, you're gonna be hosed with Muscle Milk.
Now... now don't act cold or sad.
I know that'll be the initial feeling.
You're supposed to be sexy, okay?
We're going sexy.
Ready?
Hey, Anders, are you with us or, like...
- What?
- Oh, sorry, dudes.
Please call me Andy Holmes, guys.
Just sounds more American for my brand.
I won't do that.
Ready, Blake?
Yep.
Ooh, yeah!
All right, look at the camera.
I'm rich!
- Hey, Dad.
- Yeah, Son?
What are those?
- They're my shoes.
- Smack cam!
- What?
- Oh!
God damn it, YungChillunerr!
Suck it, Dad!
I would...
I would...
I would never do that.
You guys want a hit off my Strawberry Latte Bull?
No, no, no, I'm just gonna drink the Red Bull.
And coffee here.
Whatever.
Don't care.
There's my boys,
Rancho's three biggest web celebs.
You think I'm a celeb?
Totes McGoats, man.
You've been cranking out some epic content.
Appreciate it.
So you ready to leverage your brand outside of your core demo?
Sure.
- You tell me.
- Uh, then check it.
This is the EZ Egger.
Ooh, I like it.
Impressive.
What's... what does it do?
It makes cooking eggs up to 65% easier.
- Uh, yeah.
- Eggs are tough.
I'm not sure that's on brand for me, bro.
Yeah, my flock doesn't like to cut corners, so count me out.
Yeah, it... it really doesn't matter at this point, man.
I mean, your followers should buy whatever you tell them.
That's why they're called followers.
- Okay.
- Yeah.
That's why they're called followers.
- Yeah.
- Is it...
Where's my coconut water?
I told corporate this was non-negosh.
- Alice!
- Alice!
- He's pissed.
- Man, later.
Trilly's...
Trilly's the best.
Hey, you guys need to clear out of here.
I'm gonna film a new Instagram video where
I karate chop my head through a vodka-infused candied ham.
I'm calling it a "feast of strength."
No, you can't, because I'm about to christen this the "Ronald Reagan Memorial Break Room," so...
Mmm, no, you guys are gonna have to leave.
But luckily for you, you bought yourself a few extra minutes because I have to go poo-poo.
- All right.
- Go take a Blake.
I'll be back.
Yeah, don't forget to wipe your...
Uh, what are you?
Andy?
I don't know what you're calling yourself, you idiot.
You wish.
Hey, uh, noticed you hadn't connected with me on LinkedIn.
So if you could do that, that'd be great.
Thanks.
LinkedIn is for lame old try-hards.
Are you calling me old?
Hey, never forget 9/11.
Also, never forget how old you really are.
Oh.
I want to see a birth certificate.
Oh, let me see your ID, 'cause I'm pretty sure it reads Anders.
Hmm?
Doesn't sound very American to me, does it?
You freakin' birther.
- I'm American.
- Let's see a birth certificate.
Oh, well, let's see what your real name is.
- It's Anders...
- All right, time's up.
There is no way you wiped your butt.
Uh, yeah, no, I didn't have to wipe, because it came out in just one... it just fell right out.
- Time to freakin' go.
- You know what?
Both you guys suck.
I'm gonna stack some Klout points and go to Havasu solo.
Oh, my gosh.
I can't believe you're all together IRL.
Uh, could I get a quick selfie for Facebook?
- Uh...
- Me in a photo with these guys?
I don't think so.
Yeah, but you guys are the @The3BestFrandz.
Uh, not anymore.
I can't be in a picture with these guys.
It's just...
wouldn't make sense, really.
Well, but I'm a Blaker Girl, and I'm an Adam Madam.
- And I'm Randy for Andy.
- That's not his real name.
- I can't choose one.
- Well, you kind of have to.
- Yeah.
- Don't be stupid.
It's whoever's best at social media.
- Pick one of us right now.
- Please don't do this to me!
- Just choose one!
- What are we doing?
- You pick one of us!
- Gosh damn it, boys!
What are we gonna do come Christmas?
I loved you!
All of you!
America.
Farmers, chickens, eggs.
The foundation of life, regardless of whatever Planned Parenthood tells you.
But I always say, when life tries to hard-boil you, just hard-boil eggs in under three minutes with the EZ Egger.
Real hard-boiled eggs.
That's good.
God bless America.
Get ready to soar once again.
- Ah!
- Oh!
Oh, that old yuppie just hit a baby bald eagle!
Who did that?
What was that?
Remember to follow me, YungChillunerr on Snapchat.
I see you!
You know how it is.
You're vaped out of your mind.
You're starving.
You got the munchies.
All you want is some cooked eggs, but to make them is... freakin' hard.
It sucks, but not anymore.
Now it's really easy.
Hey, Son.
Have you seen my EZ Egger?
Uh, no.
Why don't you check your butt, where you keep everything else, Dad?
EZ Egger.
Okay.
Shyeah.
How unfortunate to hear about all the Internet backlash, but I suppose the truth was going to rear its ugly head sooner or later.
Okay, cut the camera.
Yeah, right.
What are you talking about?
Well, I guess someone leaked a pic of your birth certificate and posted it on Vine.
Oops.
Karl, give me my phone.
Wait, you can't...
I hate you, Ders!
I hate you!
I got to go, Karl.
- I got to go.
- Okay.
Okay.
Oh, hey, are you gonna eat these eggs?
Okay, going to the 60-second rule.
It's all me, baby.
Hope you're happy, Andy, because my Klout Score is ruined.
Oh, give it a rest, Henderson.
You know you brought this hellfire down on both of us.
Doesn't matter anymore.
Neither of us are going to Lake Havasu now.
Oh, well, maybe Adam can go.
Yeah, maybe I could go if Instagram didn't just shut down my account.
- What?
- Oh, so you sabotaged him too.
Don't give me too much credit.
I wish I did that.
That's... that's not what happened.
I tried to hold a contest for sickest tank pic of the day, and then this girl, she showed me, uh, a pic of her jambos.
And so I was like, this deserves more than a repost,
- which was going to be the prize.
- Right.
But I know how chicks work.
It's tick for tack.
She wanted to see the D. You know what I mean?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
So I sent her a picture of my dick, and instead of sending it to her,
I posted it on the Instagram.
- Oh, you're on blast.
- Uh-oh.
I mean, I still got the jambo pic.
- You want to see it?
- Yeah.
- Oh, yeah.
- Those are sweater pups.
- Oh, nice.
- They're good, right?
They're good.
They're my cousin Tracy's.
They are nice.
Shwha?
Hmm?
Oh.
Okay.
I'm sorry.
I didn't know that when I sent the dick pic.
I should've known, because I know those tits.
- Yeah.
- DeMamps.
We're known for our giant titties.
- Some of the men too.
- Guys.
Hey, guys.
Question.
What happened to us?
I mean, look at... this is insane.
We're not these dumb brands, right?
- Right.
- I know it, man.
I mean, we used to just be three best friends who liked looking at, you know, big ol' chumbawumbas.
We're just horny, horny titty boys.
Would've seen a lot of them in Havasu.
But we're not going.
That's right.
All the stepmoms with the pasties on speedboats getting turnt up?
- Bye-bye.
- And birdwatching.
And the birdwatching.
Wait a second.
There's one more thing we can do.
It'll get our Klout Scores right through the roof.
But if we mess it up,
I'm serious when I say we can never show our faces on the Internet ever again.
Tell us.
Periscope.
Yep.
Yeah.
You guys get the car with the moonroof, and I'll be ready to hang my thang.
I'm having a big day, actually.
- But we don't need...
- Yeah.
It doesn't...
- Just let him do it.
- Yeah.
What's going on?
Maybe one of you guys can do it.
All right.
What's up?
All right, everybody.
We're gonna get back to the craft beers and vegan hot dogs in a hot sec.
But real quick, just want to officially announce the TAC Social Media Brandbassador with the highest Klout Score who's gonna be rolling deep with me to the Virality Awards in Lake Havasu.
Say my name!
Everybody!
Not so fast, punk!
Yo, yo, yo.
It's @The3BestFrandz, coming to you live on Periscope!
- Hi!
- Ah!
We've got something to tell you guys.
How many of you are sick of pretending you're someone you aren't just to get followers?
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.
For example, Ghostman.
We all know that you're not in a biker gang, man.
You had a poem published in the newspaper last week.
That was my wife's obituary.
- Yes.
- Oh.
And then, Waymond, you're not Redfoo.
No one wants to party rock at your house tonight.
Take off those stupid [bleep] glasses.
You look like an idiot.
And by golly, the same goes for you, Diane.
You don't have to carry around the stereotypical Chinese geisha fan to get followers, okay?
I'm not sure what you said, but delete whatever he told you to be, okay?
Delete that.
Feel good.
- She... she gets it.
- Yep.
Here's the main target, right here.
- Tez, my man, what's up, dude?
- Hey.
- Come on.
- Right.
You got to quit faking the funk, bro, because we know who you are.
And you don't got to do all this to rule Black Twitter, okay?
- You're working a little hard.
- Yeah, you're complex, dude.
You're more than just, you know, what we're looking at here.
- Right.
- You're right, Blake.
Get this gold off of my neck.
And you know what?
I'm going speed skating after work.
And if anybody got a problem with it, you can kiss my aerodynamic, bodysuit-wearing, natural black, hairy ass.
- All right.
- There's a visual.
- Very disgusting.
- We don't want to do that.
- Okay, yeah.
- But thank you.
Deleting all this bull[bleep].
Hey, I don't know about you guys, but I'm sick of worrying about my followers, and I'm ready to care about my friends, all right?
Yeah.
I'm sick of pretending to be a brand for likes.
Yeah.
I'm not a brand.
I'm a man.
- And we are men!
- Yep.
- And some of us are women.
- Yeah.
Not brands.
- Delete your apps!
- Yes.
Delete your apps!
Delete your apps!
Okay.
All right.
- Okay, okay, everybody.
- Delete your apps!
- Delete...
- Uh, Alice?
Alice, seems like this is getting a little out of control?
Nah, the Internet is garbage.
- Garbage?
- Okay, great.
Well, you can just tell corporate that you hate the future.
Oh, or why don't I tell corporate that ever since you signed these knuckleheads up for the "Internet,"
we haven't had a single sale?
- Delete your apps!
- Yeah!
- Delete your apps!
- Yeah!
- Delete your apps!
- All right.
All right, fine.
- Delete your apps!
- You know what?
I was gonna give y'all a beta invite to B.J. Novak's new app, but you can forget about it.
Hey, there's still one score left.
@The3BestFrandz?
I'm going to Havasu!
- We're going to Havasu, baby!
- Birdwatching!
Oh, oh, oh, [Bleep].
That's [Bleep] awesome.
On towards that again.
I'm so [Bleep] dickhead.
Okay.
Turn on the ignition.
Yep.
Now clutch, and...
- What?
What?
- Clutch!
Clutch!
Turn it off.
That's called stalling.
You said I didn't have to have my foot on the clutch!
Yeah, that's when it's in neutral.
If it's in first gear...
- You didn't say that!
- I did.
- Didn't!
- D'you
- remember which one the clutch is?
- Of course I remember!
I'm not an idiot!
Is this good for us?
The whole car licence thing?
I mean, how do we get over this tension?
Another lesson tomorrow?
- Right.
- ..1965.
Rose has been struggling to recapture his form since his stunning victory after fighting
- Harada, but his...
- No, he hasn't!
Only the Olivares fight.
What about all the ones he's won?
- He can't lose!
- You and Lionel Rose, eh?
Is that why you wanted a TV?
But Lionel and I have something special.
- Ah?
- A blackfella who's the youngest-ever world champion?
A girl can't resist.
Hey, tomorrow...
You and Pattie all set?
Mm-hm.
I'm bringing my mum, and her husband.
It's not gonna be too scary, is it?
Uh...
I mean, it's only lunch.
Dad can be a bit...
But no, no, it'll be fine.
I'm bringing savouries.
Great!
Great.
Savouries are great.
But I don't wanna bring them if he thinks that I don't like his food and...
He'll like 'em.
He'll like 'em.
- Will he like me?
- Everyone likes you.
Not everyone likes him.
He can be a bit blunt.
Martha?
Oh, sorry.
Oh...
No, that's Okay.
I've gotta get to work anyway.
Hey, if Lionel Rose rocks up, you tell him you're spoken for!
Martha, if I've done something bad, will you promise not to judge me?
Of course!
What have you done?
I think I'm pregnant.

So, this is the married man you were telling me about, the one you kissed?
- Oh, we did a bit more than that.
- Obviously.
Please tell me I don't know him.
Otherwise I'll punch him.
- No, you don't.
- Are you still seeing him?
No.
And he knows nothing about this.
How far along are you?
I'm two weeks late, and my breasts feel bigger.
I'll tell Simon you're coming to see him.
- He could do a blood test.
- Oh...
Pattie, eventually everyone's going to know.
Have the test.
Maybe you're not pregnant.
Maybe you'll be lucky.
Yeah.
Maybe.
Are these for the Moratorium office?
These are for tomorrow.
Gotta set the record straight the Adelaide bunch.
I heard that went bad.
Police said the anarchists started it.
Right, while the cops threw flowers in the air!
This is good of you, Annie.
I appreciate it.
I'll see you tomorrow.
- Annie.
- Oh!
Are you walking?
- Say 'hello'.
- Hello!
Mwah!
Hey!
Have I told you how much I missed you?
You can tell me again, if you like.
So, who was that bloke?
- Dennis.
- Dennis.
Yeah.
He's helping with the anti-Vietnam rally tomorrow.
Deanna, have you got smiles for Mummy?
- We deserve cocktails tonight.
- Blue ones.
Yeah.
Celebrating.
Viv and Annie, home safe.
You look tired.
Are you Okay?
Yeah.
Just need a bit more sleep.
Did you hear anything about your baby nephew, back in Vietnam?
No.
You look great, though.
Positively glowing!
- Am I?
- Yeah!
- Wow.
- It's exertion.
I'm keeping

- Ah.

So, when's the shower tea?
We're having a hens' night instead.
It's a new thing.
It's like a buck's party.
So we get to go crazy, like boys do!
I get it.
We can tie Martha up and leave her somewhere embarrassing.
No, we can't.
Ladies and gentlemen, please make welcome our very own star, Miss Annie Carmichael, back from wowing the troops in Vietnam.
And make sure you're here early on Friday night for her show, because the place is sure to be packed!
Thank you.
I'm very much looking forward to singing for you.
Hope you are too.
But for a moment, let's think of our troops.
Many of them are conscripts who don't even wanna be there.
Thank you.
Annie, honey, you're still here because I sent you to Vietnam and made you a star.
You sing.
That's all.
Keep your bleeding-heart shit to yourself, Okay?
- Hey!
- Hey.
Heard you were back.
How are you?
Good, thank you.
How was Vietnam?
Oh, I mostly rolled bandages.
- New suit?
- Yeah, yeah.
Well, detective constable.
What do you think, hmm?
Why don't we start with a drink?
- Sure.
I'll...
- I'll get you one.
G'day.
Heard you joined the Moratorium Committee.
Yeah.
Who told you?
Come across a bloke named Dennis Tomlinson in your travels?
- Thin.
Long, shaggy hair?
- No.
- No?
- Why's that?
Just someone I wanna have a chat to.
Sorry, can't help you.
Enjoy your night.
How'd you sleep last night?
You still having bad dreams about your brother?
And Matthew.
Everything.
You should talk to someone.
I'm talking to you.
Anyone who wasn't over there won't understand.
Joan, you still Okay to cover my shift?
- Sure.
- It's not a whole shift.
Short family lunches are better than long family lunches.
I'm allergic to your mother's cat.
Can't your neighbour take it?
I'm asking you to feed it, Patrick, not kiss it.
Well, how long are you gonna be gone for?
- About two weeks.
- Two...
Dr Millar.
- Morning.
- I'm at Mum's until 2:00.
- I need to organise someone by then.
- Okay, fine.
I'll take it.
I'll feed the bloody cat.
Thank you.
Have a good holiday.
You Okay?
I realise this is a difficult time, so if there's anything I can do?
- If you need some time off...
- No, thanks.
I'm fine.
Jim called.
He gave me a phone number.
It's a Brisbane number.
He wanted to call you here, but he thought it might compromise you.
Call at 9:30.
He'll be waiting.
How is he?
And James?
Did he say?
They're fine.
He misses you.
Hi.
I'm organising something called a hens' night for Martha tonight.
It's sort of like a shower tea...
I'm sorry, Pattie, I need to make a phone call.
Oh, of course.
Actually, I'm...
I'm calling Jim.
- So...
- Oh.
Sorry.
Yeah, I'll leave you alone.
Come on, Jim.
Pick up.
Come on, pick up.
I thought you'd developed a passion for laparoscopy.
Sir?
Just been called about a reference for you.
A job with the Department of Foreign Affairs.
You're kidding.
I applied for that job months ago.
- I didn't think I had a chance!
- Apparently you do.
But if you want your boss to act as referee, it's a good idea to check with him first.
Oh...
I did.
Remember?
At the staff morning tea?
Maybe you thought I was joking.
Perhaps I did.
Check your pigeonhole.
They want to see you tonight.
Okay.
Am I early?
No.
No, now's good!
Now's absolutely bloody fantastic.
Come on.
Okay.
I'll be working out the feasibility of the field hospitals in countries we give aid to, and helping them set up.
It's my dream job.
Hold that.
You sure no-one will know that test is mine?
I'll take it straight to the lab.
How do you feel?
Like the first time I was pregnant.
Oh.
Don't go panicking yet.
We'll get the results late this afternoon.
- Sure you're alright?
- Yeah. (COUGHS)
Hey, I know you don't want to go through the whole childbirth thing before you have to, but seriously, try not to worry.
You're two weeks late.
It's probably nothing.
- I'm...
I'm not worried, really.
- That's the ticket.
Hey... you can come and visit us in Canberra!
- Martha would like that.
- Yeah.
Yeah, me too.
- Beautiful day.
- You can feel summer coming.
- You been following me?
- No, no, no.
No, just out and about.
Did I hear you were up the north coast a couple of months back?
There was a horse substitution racket going on up there about that time.
Port Macquarie?
No, never been there.
That's odd.
Because this is you, taken on the day.
And that bloke there, that's the strapper who's coughed on you.
- What do you want?
- Dennis Tomlinson.
He's a communist.
He's a dangerous prick.
Word is, he's in town for the Moratorium marches and he's on the organising committee.
Annie doesn't know him.
She told you that.
If you can pass on any information that comes your way, I might be
- able to lose this photo.
- Yeah, I'm not a dog!
Well, how about this then, Chris?
You give me something I can use, or I'll lock you up for fraud.
Christopher!
Annie hasn't been in for her check-up.
She's good.
She's just busy.
And the baby?
Everything going well?
Yep.
You know I'm available to babysit, if you need it.
Yeah, I know.
I heard she's got a bee in her bonnet about the war.
Yep, along with a few other people.
Most of them are troublemakers and layabouts!
Well, that's not Annie, is it?
No.
Annie has an empty head she's filled with other people's ideas.
Well, lucky she doesn't give a shit what you think.
Dr Millar!
Joan, I've... had some sudden pains, like a cramp.
And... there's some blood.
This way.
So, it's just spotting?
Not heavy, like a period?
Just spots, that's all.
Is it bad?
Am I losing the baby?
I don't think so.
Any clots?
Cramps, pelvic pain...?
Just the one cramp.
I'm paranoid.
My mother had three miscarriages before they had me.
They had to give her a special drug.
Diethylstilboestrol?
Yes, I think that's it.
Should I have that?
I don't think so.
You don't have any other symptoms.
Some spotting in early pregnancy is common.
I'm going on a cruise this afternoon with my mother.
Two weeks.
If I'm on a ship in the middle of nowhere, and something happens...
Please.
I can't lose this baby.
We'll have a listen.
The Doppler machine works like a radar, using soundwaves to tell us what's going on.
Lie back and pull up your blouse for me.
I don't know how you do it.
Difficult job, a husband and a baby, and you manage perfectly well.
(SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC)
Have a listen.
That's your baby's heartbeat.
160 beats a minute.
Oh, my goodness.
It's beautiful.
Yes.
Yes, it is.
Joan?
Did you get onto Jim?
I've called the number five times, and no-one answers.
I'm sure there's a good reason.
Was it a phone box?
A pub?
Did he say anything?
I don't know where he is.
I don't know if James is alright.
I don't know if he's coming back for the trial, if he wants me there, if I should look for him...
I don't know any of it.
He'll call again.
I keep going to the house, pretending like I'm keeping things going, like that'll bring him back.
Hey!
Are you going to that rally thing?
The peace march?
Possibly.
I don't know.
My dad's a soldier, isn't he?
- Who told you that?
- A nurse.
My dad might turn up at the march.
- I don't think so.
- There's gonna be heaps of people, bands and music, and all sorts of stuff.
It's a protest rally, not the Royal Easter Show.
Never been to either.
- What do we want?
- Troops out!
- When do we want it?
- Now!
- What do we want?
- Troops out!
When do we want it?
- Now!
- What do we want?
- Troops out!
- Among the students and Unionists who are marching here today against Australia's involvement in Vietnam are many who look like they've never demonstrated before.
- What do we want?
- Troops out!
- When do we want it?
- Now!
- What do we want?
What do we want?
- Troops out!
- When do we want it?
- Now!
- Now!
- Are you willing to go to jaill for
- this cause?
- Yes, I am.
The war is wrong.
Innocent people are dying!
The government told us we'd only send advisors to this war!
Eight years on, 500 of our soldiers are dead!
What do we want?
Troops out!
- When do we want it?
- Now!
Many thousands of people will be protesting in Melbourne, and even more are expected here in Sydney.
The Moratorium Committee have emphasised that they want this to be a peaceful rally...
Bring our boys home again!
- One, two, three, four!
- We don't want war!
The police are certainly taking no chances and are out on the streets in large numbers.
Certainly, in the newsroom, we've taken a large number of calls from people who are dead against this march taking place and have made all kinds of threats.
Our government is lying!
They say it is a just war!
They say we are defending democracy.
They say we are defending freedom!
They say we are winning the war!
None of that is true!
None of it!
And one person who knows, because she's been there and just come home, is singer Annie Carmichael!
I'm outta here.
Thank you.
It's wonderful to see so many people here today... there are orphanages in South
Vietnam overflowing with children, some of them no more than babies, who have had their parents killed by the
North Vietnamese, by the Viet Cong, and by American and Australian soldiers!
Many of these children are sick.
Many are malnourished.
And all of them have had their families destroyed!
Ladies and gentlemen, many of our soldiers don't even want to be in Vietnam!
They're conscripts, who have had the bad luck of having their birthday drawn out of a barrel by a politician!
I implore you to make your voices heard!
Write to your local members of parliament, and tell them you want us out of this war!

Annie!
Annie's been arrested and she didn't do anything.
It got pretty out of control.
Well, whatever happened, it wasn't Annie's fault.
Come on, Pete, there must be something you can do.
Please?
I don't know what you're so angry about.
That was fun!
- Wipe that smile off your face.
- Let go!
You're hurting my arm!
My friend is in lock-up for something you did.
At least have the sense to feel a bit of shame!
You've been out without permission.
Sorry, Matron.
My fault.
She had nits.
I took her to the hairdresser for a treatment.
- You know the rules.
- I looked, but I couldn't find you.
I'm so sorry.
Maggie, upstairs.
Strip your bed.
In fact, strip all the beds.
Then draw fresh linen and make them all up.
Yes, Matron.
Enjoy the work.
Hitting a cop got your attention.
I should try that again.
Dr Millar.
- Are you free this afternoon?
- Why?
I'm giving a talk at Sydney Uni on the latest reproductive strategies, and it occurred to me that you're across the IVF material.
- I am.
- If we showed our hand, we could hone our pitch to the hospital board.
If nothing else, it might take your mind off things.
Sure.
This case study you're using, is it Mrs Gordon?
That's her third miscarriage.
Incompetent cervix.
If she'd come in earlier...
I can't see anything in her history.
Her mother was probably given DES.
Diethylstilboestrol?
They've discovered it can cause incompetent cervix syndrome in women whose mothers took it.
It's supposed to prevent miscarriages, and now it's causing them.
There's an irony.
- Are you sure?
- Of course.
Why?
Joan!
Eva.
There's something I may have missed.
You can't go away.
I'm sorry.
Simon's moving to Canberra?
Are they short on doctors down there?
It was more of a diplomat's job, I think.
Sorry, I was a bit distracted.
- I'm not late, am I?
- Hi, Mum.
Simon's not here yet.
Where's Ernest?
He's working.
Short notice.
Sorry.
Hello.
That dress is lovely.
Thank you.
What have you brought?
Cheese and cabanossi on biscuits.
I was going to put cocktail onions on, but then I thought the biscuits might go soggy.
They'll be delicious, I'm sure.
Should I introduce you as Daisy or Carla?
Daisy.
Definitely Daisy.
Just look at my daughter.
About to marry a doctor.
A handsome doctor!
Yes.
Don't forget that bit!
- Shall I drive?
- No.
I hear you got another job.
What about you, Henry?
Any hobbies?
Used to collect stamps, 'till I realised it was a total and utter waste of time and money.
Martha likes watching the boxing.
Boxing's stupid.
Lionel Rose isn't stupid.
All boxers are stupid as a bowling ball.
I like cooking.
Big dill.
People say he takes after his mother.
- She must have been lovely.
- Yeah.
- Kept me on a tight leash.
- Those were the days.
- Genetics.
Fascinating.
- Mmm.
I've heard people say that sons often look more like their fathers.
- Do you think that's true?
- No!
It's a bloody lottery.
I mean, look at you two.
You're almost white,
- but Martha's black as coal!
- Dad...
Martha's father was a Kamilaroi man.
Where is he?
He passed away.
- I remarried.
- Did you marry another black bloke?
- No, actually.
- Hmm.
The thing is, it's a dance of dominant and recessive genes.
You see, dark skin can pop up any time, generations down the track, regardless of interbreeding.
- That's interesting.
- Well, you would've talked about that with your new bloke.
- Not really.
- Does it matter?
Of course it bloody matters.
It's science.
I mean, your kids could be anything.
Black, white or brindle.
So what!
Excuse me.
I'm just gonna...
What the hell, Dad?
A word?
Please?
Go back inside.
I'll be alright.
He's just talking science stuff.
Doctors do that.
I don't think he was having a go at us.
He was having a go at your fiance.
That's how it happens sometimes.
What is it?
Ernest has left me.
When I told him the truth about who I was, he said he was fine.
But he wasn't.
He asked me to keep up the idea that I was Spanish.
I tried.
But I couldn't be something I wasn't anymore.
I'll take you home.
You're unbelievable!
You had that whole thing planned out!
Or are you that bad on the spur of the moment?
You're starting to sound just like your mother.
There's no surprises there.
She couldn't face the truth either.
Three weeks you had to deal with that lunch!
Three weeks you had to think about it.
But you couldn't help yourself!
What?
I was just talking about facts.
Bullshit!
All that dark skin crap, all the terrors of entertaining public servants!
They are facts, whether you like it or not.
Do you think life's gonna be easy with a black wife?
I know what people are like, but I love her.
I'll make sure she's alright!
As if love is ever enough.
An 'incompetent cervix'?
Makes it sound like it's just not trying.
It's most likely caused by the drug your mother was given.
- And this operation?
- A 'cerclage'.
It's basically threading a band around the cervix to stop it from opening prematurely.
You can have it done at another hospital if you want.
Every gynaecologist in the city knows Patrick.
If I go somewhere else, he's even more likely to find out.
I'll admit you under a different name.
If anyone asks, you're Mrs Sandra Holloway.
Now, I can't operate until Patrick's out of the hospital.
Until then, we'll lower the head of your bed down.
We'll raise your lower body, and that will take the pressure off your cervix.
And if I don't have the operation?
You'll lose the child.
Martha, I'm sorry.
I'm so, so, sorry.
Hey.
My dad just can't keep his big mouth shut.
- Is your mum gonna be alright?
- She will be.
Okay.
Everything my dad said was wrong.
- No.
It wasn't.
- Oh, don't you start.
- It was honest.
I like that.
- Honest doesn't mean right.
Simon, he is right.
Having a black wife will be hard.
Have you really thought about that?
Yes!
But I'm gonna get this job in Canberra.
I'm gonna buy you a warm jumper and we're gonna have the best bloody life together!
I don't wanna have to have this conversation again!
But we've never really had this conversation.
The job in Canberra sounds fantastic.
But think about what happened at Dr. McNaughton's place, how you ended up pushing that bloke into the pool.
- So what?
I love you!
- But in 20 years' time?
I'll feel the same way.
You can't push all of Canberra into a pool.
It's not how the world works.
You were supposed to cover for Bowditch, but you were gone for more than an hour.
I know.
I'm sorry.
There was a personal emergency.
Your husband?
Have you heard something?
No, no, it's something else.
It's sorted now.
But I have so much work to catch up on.
Is there... is there anything I can do?
No.
You have that talk at the university.
Is that now?
You were gonna join me!
I'm sorry.
Next time.
Oh, Simon!
Perfect.
Uh...
Ah!
Sorry, but I need your help.
Now.
I need to see Annie Carmichael.
I'll deal with this.
Where is she?
You can't lock her up.
She's pregnant.
Well, between you and me, she's got a few dramas.
Assault police, resist arrest, offensive language...
And that's just for starters.
Well, you can get her out.
- You know you can.
- Oh.
Well, you know the deal.
If you come to the party, I'll see what I can do.
What did you do?
Nothing.
Right, it's here somewhere, but don't panic, I had a quick glance at it before, and I'm pretty sure it's good news.
Got your interview soon?
In an hour.
It's just a formality though?
Apparently.
Did... did Martha say she was worried about that?
No, no...
We didn't really talk much after the lunch.
Everything's gonna work out just fine.
Um...
Ah!
Here it is.
Good news, Pattie.
You're not pregnant.
Are you sure?
Yeah.
Yeah, one less thing to worry about, eh?
Yeah.

So, I'm guessing the result from Simon came back.
Yep.
It's negative.
So I'm celebrating.

Today's surgical roster.
A cerclage in Theatre B.
Mrs Holloway?
Dr Millar operated.
Would you like me to enquire further?
No.
No, that's fine.
Thanks.
Leftovers.
There's still a lot of chicken, if you're hungry.
I've come to apologise.
I shouldn't have yelled at you.
I was saying hard things.
I went too far.
I...
I had my interview.
I'm exactly what they're looking for.
Of course you are.
Did you mention Martha?
They asked if I was attached.
You were right.
They made it clear.
They want me, but not with her.
So, a crossroads then.
Go on, hit him!
Rose has got it sewn up, without a doubt...
- Hit him!
- Hit him one side, hitting the other...
Yes!
Ah, yes, there's the bell!
And doesn't Lionel look confident?
It was his best performance since he beat
Fighting Harada in Tokyo...
- How's he going?
- Oh, he's won that one on points, for sure.
His career's back on track.
See?
You shouldn't have been so worried.
About anything.
- Hey?
- Mmm?
I promise you, in 20 years' time, we're gonna be happy, and we'll have a tribe of different-coloured kids.
And we're still gonna be in love.
Okay?
And everything's just gonna work out the way we want it to.
A tribe of kids in Colombo?
Didn't get the job.
I'm so sorry.
It's Okay.
I think they wanted someone a bit older.
Who knows, really?
Who knows.
Yeah.
Something else will come along.
Something better for the both of us.

Rose has been struggling to recapture his form since his stunning victory after fighting
Harada, but his...
No, he hasn't!
Only the Olivares fight.
What about all the ones he's won?
He can't lose!
You and Lionel Rose, eh?
Is that why you wanted a TV?
But Lionel and I have something special.
Ah?
A blackfella who's the youngest-ever world champion?
A girl can't resist.
Hey, tomorrow...
You and Pattie all set?
Mm-hm.
I'm bringing my mum, and her husband.
It's not gonna be too scary, is it?
Uh...
I mean, it's only lunch.
Dad can be a bit...
But no, no, it'll be fine.
I'm bringing savouries.
Great!
Great.
Savouries are great.
But I don't wanna bring them if he thinks that I don't like his food and...
He'll like 'em.
He'll like 'em.
Will he like me?
Everyone likes you.
Not everyone likes him.
He can be a bit blunt.
Martha?
Oh, sorry.
Oh...
No, that's OK.
I've gotta get to work anyway.
Hey, if Lionel Rose rocks up, you tell him you're spoken for!
Martha, if I've done something bad, will you promise not to judge me?
Of course!
What have you done?
I think I'm pregnant.
So, this is the married man you were telling me about, the one you kissed?
Oh, we did a bit more than that.
Obviously.
Please tell me I don't know him.
Otherwise I'll punch him.
No, you don't.
Are you still seeing him?
No.
And he knows nothing about this.
How far along are you?
I'm two weeks late, and my breasts feel bigger.
I'll tell Simon you're coming to see him.
He could do a blood test.
Oh...
Pattie, eventually everyone's going to know.
Have the test.
Maybe you're not pregnant.
Maybe you'll be lucky.
Yeah.
Maybe.
Are these for the Moratorium office?
These are for tomorrow.
Gotta set the record straight the Adelaide bunch.
I heard that went bad.
Police said the anarchists started it.
Right, while the cops threw flowers in the air!
This is good of you, Annie.
I appreciate it.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Annie.
Oh!
Are you walking?
Say 'hello'.
Hello!
Mwah!
Hey!
Have I told you how much I missed you?
You can tell me again, if you like.
So, who was that bloke?
Dennis.
Dennis.
Yeah.
He's helping with the anti-Vietnam rally tomorrow.
Deanna, have you got smiles for Mummy?
We deserve cocktails tonight.
Blue ones.
Yeah.

Viv and Annie, home safe.
You look tired.
Are you OK?
Yeah.
Just need a bit more sleep.
Did you hear anything about your baby nephew, back in Vietnam?
No.
You look great, though.

Yeah!
Wow.
It's exertion.

We can tie Martha up and leave her somewhere embarrassing.
No, we can't.

And make sure you're here early on Friday night for her show, because the place is sure to be packed!
Thank you.
I'm very much looking forward to singing for you.
Hope you are too.
But for a moment, let's think of our troops.
Many of them are conscripts who don't even wanna be there.
Thank you.
Annie, honey, you're still here because I sent you to Vietnam and made you a star.
You sing.
That's all.
Keep your bleeding-heart shit to yourself, OK?
Hey!
Hey.
Heard you were back.
How are you?
Good, thank you.
How was Vietnam?
Oh, I mostly rolled bandages.

Yeah, yeah.
Well, detective constable.
What do you think, hmm?
Why don't we start with a drink?
Sure.
I'll...
I'll get you one.
G'day.

Yeah.
Who told you?
Come across a bloke named Dennis Tomlinson in your travels?
Thin.
Long, shaggy hair?
No.
No?
Why's that?
Just someone I wanna have a chat to.
Sorry, can't help you.
Enjoy your night.
How'd you sleep last night?
You still having bad dreams about your brother?
And Matthew.
Everything.
You should talk to someone.
I'm talking to you.
Anyone who wasn't over there won't understand.
Joan, you still OK to cover my shift?
Sure.
It's not a whole shift.
Short family lunches are better than long family lunches.

You OK?
I realise this is a difficult time, so if there's anything I can do?
If you need some time off...
No, thanks.
I'm fine.
Jim called.
He gave me a phone number.
It's a Brisbane number.
He wanted to call you here, but he thought it might compromise you.
Call at 9:30.
He'll be waiting.
How is he?
And James?
Did he say?
They're fine.
He misses you.
Hi.
I'm organising something called a hens' night for Martha tonight.
It's sort of like a shower tea...
I'm sorry, Pattie, I need to make a phone call.
Oh, of course.
Actually, I'm...
I'm calling Jim.
So...
Oh.
Sorry.
Yeah, I'll leave you alone.
Come on, Jim.
Pick up.
Come on, pick up.
I thought you'd developed a passion for laparoscopy.
Sir?
Just been called about a reference for you.
A job with the Department of Foreign Affairs.
You're kidding.
I applied for that job months ago.
I didn't think I had a chance!
Apparently you do.
But if you want your boss to act as referee, it's a good idea to check with him first.
Oh...
I did.
Remember?
At the staff morning tea?
Maybe you thought I was joking.
Perhaps I did.
Check your pigeonhole.
They want to see you tonight.
OK.
Am I early?
No.
No, now's good!
Now's absolutely bloody fantastic.
Come on.
OK.
I'll be working out the feasibility of the field hospitals in countries we give aid to, and helping them set up.
It's my dream job.
Hold that.
You sure no-one will know that test is mine?
I'll take it straight to the lab.
How do you feel?
Like the first time I was pregnant.
Oh.
Don't go panicking yet.
We'll get the results late this afternoon.
Sure you're alright?
Yeah.
Hey, I know you don't want to go through the whole childbirth thing before you have to, but seriously, try not to worry.
You're two weeks late.
It's probably nothing.
I'm...
I'm not worried, really.
That's the ticket.
Hey, you can come and visit us in Canberra!
Martha would like that.
Yeah.
Yeah, me too.
Beautiful day.
You can feel summer coming.
You been following me?
No, no, no.
No, just out and about.
Did I hear you were up the north coast a couple of months back?
There was a horse substitution racket going on up there about that time.
Port Macquarie?
No, never been there.
That's odd.
Because this is you, taken on the day.
And that bloke there, that's the strapper who's coughed on you.
What do you want?
Dennis Tomlinson.
He's a communist.
He's a dangerous prick.
Word is, he's in town for the Moratorium marches and he's on the organising committee.
Annie doesn't know him.
She told you that.
If you can pass on any information that comes your way, I might be able to lose this photo.
Yeah, I'm not a dog!
Well, how about this then, Chris?
You give me something I can use, or I'll lock you up for fraud.
Christopher!
Annie hasn't been in for her check-up.
She's good.
She's just busy.
And the baby?
Everything going well?
Yep.
You know I'm available to babysit, if you need it.
Yeah, I know.
I heard she's got a bee in her bonnet about the war.
Yep, along with a few other people.
Most of them are troublemakers and layabouts!
Well, that's not Annie, is it?
No.
Annie has an empty head she's filled with other people's ideas.
Well, lucky she doesn't give a shit what you think.
Dr Millar!
Joan, I've...had some sudden pains, like a cramp.
And...there's some blood.
This way.
So, it's just spotting?
Not heavy, like a period?
Just spots, that's all.
Is it bad?
Am I losing the baby?
I don't think so.
Any clots?
Cramps, pelvic pain...?
Just the one cramp.
I'm paranoid.
My mother had three miscarriages before they had me.
They had to give her a special drug.
Diethylstilboestrol?
Yes, I think that's it.
Should I have that?
I don't think so.
You don't have any other symptoms.
Some spotting in early pregnancy is common.
I'm going on a cruise this afternoon with my mother.
Two weeks.
If I'm on a ship in the middle of nowhere, and something happens...
Please.
I can't lose this baby.
We'll have a listen.
The Doppler machine works like a radar, using soundwaves to tell us what's going on.
Lie back and pull up your blouse for me.
I don't know how you do it.
Difficult job, a husband and a baby, and you manage perfectly well.
Have a listen.
That's your baby's heartbeat.
160 beats a minute.
Oh, my goodness.
It's beautiful.
Yes.
Yes, it is.
Joan?
Did you get onto Jim?
I've called the number five times, and no-one answers.
I'm sure there's a good reason.
Was it a phone box?
A pub?
Did he say anything?
I don't know where he is.
I don't know if James is alright.
I don't know if he's coming back for the trial, if he wants me there, if I should look for him...
I don't know any of it.
He'll call again.
I keep going to the house, pretending like I'm keeping things going, like that'll bring him back.
Hey!
Are you going to that rally thing?
The peace march?
Possibly.
I don't know.
My dad's a soldier, isn't he?
Who told you that?
A nurse.
My dad might turn up at the march.
I don't think so.
There's gonna be heaps of people, bands and music, and all sorts of stuff.
It's a protest rally, not the Royal Easter Show.
Never been to either.
What do we want?
Troops out!
When do we want it?
Now!
What do we want?
Troops out!
When do we want it?
Now!
What do we want?
Troops out!
Among the students and Unionists who are marching here today against Australia's involvement in Vietnam are many who look like they've never demonstrated before.
What do we want?
Troops out!
When do we want it?
Now!
What do we want?
What do we want?
Troops out!
When do we want it?
Now!
Now!
Are you willing to go to gaol for this cause?
Yes, I am.
The war is wrong.
Innocent people are dying!
The government told us we'd only send advisors to this war!
Eight years on, 500 of our soldiers are dead!
What do we want?
Troops out!
When do we want it?
Now!
Many thousands of people will be protesting in Melbourne, and even more are expected here in Sydney.
The Moratorium Committee have emphasised that they want this to be a peaceful rally...
Bring our boys home again!
One, two, three, four!
We don't want war!
The police are certainly taking no chances and are out on the streets in large numbers.
Certainly, in the newsroom, we've taken a large number of calls from people who are dead against this march taking place and have made all kinds of threats.
Our government is lying!
They say it is a just war!
They say we are defending democracy.
They say we are defending freedom!
They say we are winning the war!
None of that is true!
None of it!
And one person who knows, because she's been there and just come home, is singer Annie Carmichael!
I'm outta here.
Thank you.
It's wonderful to see so many people here today.
There are orphanages in South
Vietnam overflowing with children, some of them no more than babies, who have had their parents killed by the North Vietnamese, by the Viet
Cong, and by American and Australian soldiers!
Many of these children are sick.
Many are malnourished.
And all of them have had their families destroyed!
Ladies and gentlemen, many of our soldiers don't even want to be in Vietnam!
They're conscripts, who have had the bad luck of having their birthday drawn out of a barrel by a politician!
I implore you to make your voices heard!
Write to your local members of parliament, and tell them you want us out of this war!
# There's something happening here
# What it is ain't exactly clear... #
Hey, careful!
Stop pushing!
Be careful!
# There's a man with a gun over there... #
Maggie...
Maggie!
What are you doing?
# Stop, children, what's that sound
# Everybody look what's going on... #
What the hell do you think you're doing!
I didn't do anything!
No, no!
She didn't do anything!
No!
She's pregnant!
# Stop, children, what's that sound
# Everybody look what's going on
# Stop, children, what's that sound
# Everybody... #
Annie!
Annie's been arrested and she didn't do anything.
It got pretty out of control.
Well, whatever happened, it wasn't Annie's fault.
Come on, Pete, there must be something you can do.
Please?
I don't know what you're so angry about.
That was fun!
Wipe that smile off your face.
Let go!
You're hurting my arm!
My friend is in lock-up for something you did.
At least have the sense to feel a bit of shame!
You've been out without permission.
Sorry, Matron.
My fault.
She had nits.
I took her to the hairdresser for a treatment.
You know the rules.
I looked, but I couldn't find you.
I'm so sorry.
Maggie, upstairs.
Strip your bed.
In fact, strip all the beds.
Then draw fresh linen and make them all up.
Yes, Matron.
Enjoy the work.
Hitting a cop got your attention.
I should try that again.
Dr Millar.
Are you free this afternoon?
Why?
I'm giving a talk at Sydney Uni on the latest reproductive strategies, and it occurred to me that you're across the IVF material.
I am.
If we showed our hand, we could hone our pitch to the hospital board.
If nothing else, it might take your mind off things.
Sure.
This case study you're using, is it Mrs Gordon?
That's her third miscarriage.
Incompetent cervix.
If she'd come in earlier...
I can't see anything in her history.
Her mother was probably given DES.
Diethylstilboestrol?
They've discovered it can cause incompetent cervix syndrome in women whose mothers took it.
It's supposed to prevent miscarriages, and now it's causing them.
There's an irony.
Are you sure?
Of course.
Why?
Joan!
Eva.
There's something I may have missed.
You can't go away.
I'm sorry.
Simon's moving to Canberra?
Are they short on doctors down there?
It was more of a diplomat's job, I think.
Sorry, I was a bit distracted.
I'm not late, am I?
Hi, Mum.
Simon's not here yet.
Where's Ernest?
He's working.
Short notice.
Sorry.
Hello.
That dress is lovely.
Thank you.
What have you brought?
Cheese and cabanossi on biscuits.
I was going to put cocktail onions on, but then I thought the biscuits might go soggy.
They'll be delicious, I'm sure.
Should I introduce you as Daisy or Carla?
Daisy.
Definitely Daisy.
Just look at my daughter.
About to marry a doctor.
A handsome doctor!
Yes.
Don't forget that bit!
Shall I drive?
No.
I hear you got another job.
What about you, Henry?
Any hobbies?
Used to collect stamps, 'till I realised it was a total and utter waste of time and money.
Martha likes watching the boxing.
Boxing's stupid.
Lionel Rose isn't stupid.
All boxers are stupid as a bowling ball.
I like cooking.
Big dill.
People say he takes after his mother.
She must have been lovely.
Yeah.
Kept me on a tight leash.
Those were the days.
Genetics.
Fascinating.
Mmm.
I've heard people say that sons often look more like their fathers.
Do you think that's true?
No!
It's a bloody lottery.
I mean, look at you two.
You're almost white, but Martha's black as coal!
Dad...
Martha's father was a Kamilaroi man.
Where is he?
He passed away.
I remarried.
Did you marry another black bloke?
No, actually.
Hmm.
The thing is, it's a dance of dominant and recessive genes.
You see, dark skin can pop up any time, generations down the track, regardless of interbreeding.
That's interesting.
Well, you would've talked about that with your new bloke.
Not really.
Does it matter?
Of course it bloody matters.
It's science.
I mean, your kids could be anything.
Black, white or brindle.
So what!
Excuse me.
I'm just gonna...
What the hell, Dad?
A word?
Please?
Go back inside.
I'll be alright.
He's just talking science stuff.
Doctors do that.
I don't think he was having a go at us.
He was having a go at your fiance.
That's how it happens sometimes.
What is it?
Ernest has left me.
When I told him the truth about who I was, he said he was fine.
But he wasn't.
He asked me to keep up the idea that I was Spanish.
I tried.
But I couldn't be something I wasn't anymore.
I'll take you home.
You're unbelievable!
You had that whole thing planned out!
Or are you that bad on the spur of the moment?
You're starting to sound just like your mother.
There's no surprises there.
She couldn't face the truth either.
Three weeks you had to deal with that lunch!
Three weeks you had to think about it.
But you couldn't help yourself!
What?
I was just talking about facts.
Bullshit!
All that dark skin crap, all the terrors of entertaining public servants!
They are facts, whether you like it or not.
Do you think life's gonna be easy with a black wife?
I know what people are like, but I love her.
I'll make sure she's alright!
As if love is ever enough.
An 'incompetent cervix'?
Makes it sound like it's just not trying.
It's most likely caused by the drug your mother was given.
And this operation?
A 'cerclage'.
It's basically threading a band around the cervix to stop it from opening prematurely.
You can have it done at another hospital if you want.
Every gynaecologist in the city knows Patrick.
If I go somewhere else, he's even more likely to find out.
I'll admit you under a different name.
If anyone asks, you're Mrs Sandra Holloway.
Now, I can't operate until Patrick's out of the hospital.
Until then, we'll lower the head of your bed down.
We'll raise your lower body, and that will take the pressure off your cervix.
And if I don't have the operation?
You'll lose the child.
Martha, I'm sorry.
I'm so, so, sorry.
Hey.
My dad just can't keep his big mouth shut.
Is your mum gonna be alright?
She will be.
OK.
Everything my dad said was wrong.
No.
It wasn't.
Oh, don't you start.
It was honest.
I like that.
Honest doesn't mean right.
Simon, he is right.
Having a black wife will be hard.
Have you really thought about that?
Yes!
But I'm gonna get this job in Canberra.
I'm gonna buy you a warm jumper and we're gonna have the best bloody life together!
I don't wanna have to have this conversation again!
But we've never really had this conversation.
The job in Canberra sounds fantastic.
But think about what happened at Dr
McNaughton's place, how you ended up pushing that bloke into the pool.
So what?
I love you!
But in 20 years' time?
I'll feel the same way.
You can't push all of Canberra into a pool.
It's not how the world works.
You were supposed to cover for Bowditch, but you were gone for more than an hour.
I know.
I'm sorry.
There was a personal emergency.
Your husband?
Have you heard something?
No, no, it's something else.
It's sorted now.
But I have so much work to catch up on.
Is there...is there anything I can do?
No.
You have that talk at the university.
Is that now?
You were gonna join me!
I'm sorry.
Next time.
Oh, Simon!
Perfect.
Uh...
Ah!
Sorry, but I need your help.
Now.
I need to see Annie Carmichael.
I'll deal with this.
Where is she?
You can't lock her up.
She's pregnant.
Well, between you and me, she's got a few dramas.
Assault police, resist arrest, offensive language...
And that's just for starters.
Well, you can get her out.
You know you can.
Oh.
Well, you know the deal.
If you come to the party, I'll see what I can do.
What did you do?
Nothing.
Right, it's here somewhere, but don't panic, I had a quick glance at it before, and I'm pretty sure it's good news.
Got your interview soon?
In an hour.
It's just a formality though?
Apparently.
Did...did Martha say she was worried about that?
No, no...
We didn't really talk much after the lunch.
Everything's gonna work out just fine.
Um...
Ah!
Here it is.
Good news, Pattie.
You're not pregnant.
Are you sure?
Yeah.
Yeah, one less thing to worry about, eh?
Yeah.
# Anyone who ever loved, could look at me... #
Here, Pattie, your turn.
My turn, my turn...
Read it out, read it out.
"Grab the nearest guy and kiss him!"
It's that guy.
He's the nearest.
Look at him.
Mr Dreamy.
Go on!
No, no, no, no, I am done with kissing boys.
I'm done.
Seems a shame to waste him.
Go on!
She's gonna do it!
It's your birthday.
Whoo-hoo!
So, I'm guessing the result from Simon came back.
Yep.
It's negative.
So I'm celebrating.
What about me?
What about you?
Go on, Annie.
I think you've earned it!
Hold this?
# Loving you the way I do
# I take you back, without you I'd die, dear
# Knowing I love you so
# Anyone who had a heart Would take me in his arms
# And love me too... #
Hi.
Four 'Martha's getting married' cocktails.
Put whatever you want in them, as long as it's alcohol.
No, I've gotta stay sober for the fight.
What fight?
Lionel Rose.
Not to worry, I'll have yours then.
# Oh, oh, oh, no...
# Oh, oh, oh...#
Thank you for getting Annie out today.
Well, she's your friend.
Nice veil.
Lift it and see what happens.
# Anyone who had a heart
# Would take me in his arms and love me too
# You couldn't really have a heart and hurt me
# Like you hurt me and be so untrue... #
Don't worry.
I'll be absolutely sober by the show tomorrow night.
I heard you got arrested.
I'll have to pay half those coppers to stay open.
You wanna fight them, get another job.
What?
Clear out your lipsticks and piss off!
# Anyone who had a heart would surely take me in his arms
# And always love me
# Why won't you?
#
Doctor.
Oh, Frances.
Today's surgical roster.
A cerclage in Theatre B.
Mrs Holloway?
Dr Millar operated.
Would you like me to enquire further?
No.
No, that's fine.
Thanks.
Leftovers.
There's still a lot of chicken, if you're hungry.
I've come to apologise.
I shouldn't have yelled at you.
I was saying hard things.
I went too far.
I...
I had my interview.
I'm exactly what they're looking for.
Of course you are.
Did you mention Martha?
They asked if I was attached.
You were right.
They made it clear.
They want me, but not with her.
So, a crossroads then.
Go on, hit him!
Rose has got it sewn up, without a doubt...
Hit him!
Hit him one side, hitting the other...
Yes!
Ah, yes, there's the bell!
And doesn't Lionel look confident?
It was his best performance since he beat
Fighting Harada in Tokyo...
How's he going?
Oh, he's won that one on points, for sure.
His career's back on track.
See?
You shouldn't have been so worried.
About anything.
Hey?
Mmm?
I promise you, in 20 years' time, we're gonna be happy, and we'll have a tribe of different-coloured kids.
And we're still gonna be in love.
OK?
And everything's just gonna work out the way we want it to.
A tribe of kids in Colombo?
Didn't get the job.
I'm so sorry.
It's OK.
I think they wanted someone a bit older.
Who knows, really?
Who knows.
Yeah.
Something else will come along.
Something better for the both of us.
Subtitle by peritta.
Resynced by GeoffS

OK.
Turn on the ignition.
Yep.
Now clutch, and...
What?
What?
Clutch!
Clutch!
Turn it off.
That's called stalling.
You said I didn't have to have my foot on the clutch!
Yeah, that's when it's in neutral.
If it's in first gear...
You didn't say that!
I did.
Didn't!
D'you remember which one the clutch is?
Of course I remember!
I'm not an idiot!
Is this good for us?
The whole car licence thing?
I mean, how do we get over this tension?
Another lesson tomorrow?
Right.
..1965.
Rose has been struggling to recapture his form since his stunning victory after fighting
Harada, but his...
No, he hasn't!
Only the Olivares fight.
What about all the ones he's won?
He can't lose!
You and Lionel Rose, eh?
Is that why you wanted a TV?
But Lionel and I have something special.
Ah?
A blackfella who's the youngest-ever world champion?
A girl can't resist.
Hey, tomorrow...
You and Pattie all set?
Mm-hm.
I'm bringing my mum, and her husband.
It's not gonna be too scary, is it?
Uh...
I mean, it's only lunch.
Dad can be a bit...
But no, no, it'll be fine.
I'm bringing savouries.
Great!
Great.
Savouries are great.
But I don't wanna bring them if he thinks that I don't like his food and...
He'll like 'em.
He'll like 'em.
Will he like me?
Everyone likes you.
Not everyone likes him.
He can be a bit blunt.
Martha?
Oh, sorry.
Oh...
No, that's OK.
I've gotta get to work anyway.
Hey, if Lionel Rose rocks up, you tell him you're spoken for!
Martha, if I've done something bad, will you promise not to judge me?
Of course!
What have you done?
I think I'm pregnant.
# You think that I don't feel love
# What I feel for you is real love
# In other's eyes I see reflected
# A hurt, scorned, rejected
# Love child
# Different from the rest...#
So, this is the married man you were telling me about, the one you kissed?
Oh, we did a bit more than that.
Obviously.
Please tell me I don't know him.
Otherwise I'll punch him.
No, you don't.
Are you still seeing him?
No.
And he knows nothing about this.
How far along are you?
I'm two weeks late, and my breasts feel bigger.
I'll tell Simon you're coming to see him.
He could do a blood test.
Oh...
Pattie, eventually everyone's going to know.
Have the test.
Maybe you're not pregnant.
Maybe you'll be lucky.
Yeah.
Maybe.
Are these for the Moratorium office?
These are for tomorrow.
Gotta set the record straight the Adelaide bunch.
I heard that went bad.
Police said the anarchists started it.
Right, while the cops threw flowers in the air!
This is good of you, Annie.
I appreciate it.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Annie.
Oh!
Are you walking?
Say 'hello'.
Hello!
Mwah!
Hey!
Have I told you how much I missed you?
You can tell me again, if you like.
So, who was that bloke?
Dennis.
Dennis.
Yeah.
He's helping with the anti-Vietnam rally tomorrow.
Deanna, have you got smiles for Mummy?
We deserve cocktails tonight.
Blue ones.
Yeah.
Celebrating.
Viv and Annie, home safe.
You look tired.
Are you OK?
Yeah.
Just need a bit more sleep.
Did you hear anything about your baby nephew, back in Vietnam?
No.
You look great, though.
Positively glowing!
Am I?
Yeah!
Wow.
It's exertion.
I'm keeping her busy on maid of honour duties.
Ah.
# Late in the evening with her and my cigarettes
# Feeling up my blesses and listening to my half high self...#
So, when's the shower tea?
We're having a hens' night instead.
It's a new thing.
It's like a buck's party.
So we get to go crazy, like boys do!
I get it.
We can tie Martha up and leave her somewhere embarrassing.
No, we can't.
Ladies and gentlemen, please make welcome our very own star, Miss Annie Carmichael, back from wowing the troops in Vietnam.
And make sure you're here early on Friday night for her show, because the place is sure to be packed!
Thank you.
I'm very much looking forward to singing for you.
Hope you are too.
But for a moment, let's think of our troops.
Many of them are conscripts who don't even wanna be there.
Thank you.
Annie, honey, you're still here because I sent you to Vietnam and made you a star.
You sing.
That's all.
Keep your bleeding-heart shit to yourself, OK?
Hey!
Hey.
Heard you were back.
How are you?
Good, thank you.
How was Vietnam?
Oh, I mostly rolled bandages.
New suit?
Yeah, yeah.
Well, detective constable.
What do you think, hmm?
Why don't we start with a drink?
Sure.
I'll...
I'll get you one.
G'day.
Heard you joined the Moratorium Committee.
Yeah.
Who told you?
Come across a bloke named Dennis Tomlinson in your travels?
Thin.
Long, shaggy hair?
No.
No?
Why's that?
Just someone I wanna have a chat to.
Sorry, can't help you.
Enjoy your night.
How'd you sleep last night?
You still having bad dreams about your brother?
And Matthew.
Everything.
You should talk to someone.
I'm talking to you.
Anyone who wasn't over there won't understand.
Joan, you still OK to cover my shift?
Sure.
It's not a whole shift.
Short family lunches are better than long family lunches.
I'm allergic to your mother's cat.
Can't your neighbour take it?
I'm asking you to feed it, Patrick, not kiss it.
Well, how long are you gonna be gone for?
About two weeks.
Two...
Dr Millar.
Morning.
I'm at Mum's until 2:00.
I need to organise someone by then.
OK, fine.
I'll take it.
I'll feed the bloody cat.
Thank you.
Have a good holiday.
You OK?
I realise this is a difficult time, so if there's anything I can do?
If you need some time off...
No, thanks.
I'm fine.
Jim called.
He gave me a phone number.
It's a Brisbane number.
He wanted to call you here, but he thought it might compromise you.
Call at 9:30.
He'll be waiting.
How is he?
And James?
Did he say?
They're fine.
He misses you.
Hi.
I'm organising something called a hens' night for Martha tonight.
It's sort of like a shower tea...
I'm sorry, Pattie, I need to make a phone call.
Oh, of course.
Actually, I'm...
I'm calling Jim.
So...
Oh.
Sorry.
Yeah, I'll leave you alone.
Come on, Jim.
Pick up.
Come on, pick up.
I thought you'd developed a passion for laparoscopy.
Sir?
Just been called about a reference for you.
A job with the Department of Foreign Affairs.
You're kidding.
I applied for that job months ago.
I didn't think I had a chance!
Apparently you do.
But if you want your boss to act as referee, it's a good idea to check with him first.
Oh...
I did.
Remember?
At the staff morning tea?
Maybe you thought I was joking.
Perhaps I did.
Check your pigeonhole.
They want to see you tonight.
OK.
Am I early?
No.
No, now's good!
Now's absolutely bloody fantastic.
Come on.
OK.
I'll be working out the feasibility of the field hospitals in countries we give aid to, and helping them set up.
It's my dream job.
Hold that.
You sure no-one will know that test is mine?
I'll take it straight to the lab.
How do you feel?
Like the first time I was pregnant.
Oh.
Don't go panicking yet.
We'll get the results late this afternoon.
Sure you're alright?
Yeah.
Hey, I know you don't want to go through the whole childbirth thing before you have to, but seriously, try not to worry.
You're two weeks late.
It's probably nothing.
I'm...
I'm not worried, really.
That's the ticket.
Hey, you can come and visit us in Canberra!
Martha would like that.
Yeah.
Yeah, me too.
Beautiful day.
You can feel summer coming.
You been following me?
No, no, no.
No, just out and about.
Did I hear you were up the north coast a couple of months back?
There was a horse substitution racket going on up there about that time.
Port Macquarie?
No, never been there.
That's odd.
Because this is you, taken on the day.
And that bloke there, that's the strapper who's coughed on you.
What do you want?
Dennis Tomlinson.
He's a communist.
He's a dangerous prick.
Word is, he's in town for the Moratorium marches and he's on the organising committee.
Annie doesn't know him.
She told you that.
If you can pass on any information that comes your way, I might be able to lose this photo.
Yeah, I'm not a dog!
Well, how about this then, Chris?
You give me something I can use, or I'll lock you up for fraud.
Christopher!
Annie hasn't been in for her check-up.
She's good.
She's just busy.
And the baby?
Everything going well?
Yep.
You know I'm available to babysit, if you need it.
Yeah, I know.
I heard she's got a bee in her bonnet about the war.
Yep, along with a few other people.
Most of them are troublemakers and layabouts!
Well, that's not Annie, is it?
No.
Annie has an empty head she's filled with other people's ideas.
Well, lucky she doesn't give a shit what you think.
Dr Millar!
Joan, I've...had some sudden pains, like a cramp.
And...there's some blood.
This way.
So, it's just spotting?
Not heavy, like a period?
Just spots, that's all.
Is it bad?
Am I losing the baby?
I don't think so.
Any clots?
Cramps, pelvic pain...?
Just the one cramp.
I'm paranoid.
My mother had three miscarriages before they had me.
They had to give her a special drug.
Diethylstilboestrol?
Yes, I think that's it.
Should I have that?
I don't think so.
You don't have any other symptoms.
Some spotting in early pregnancy is common.
I'm going on a cruise this afternoon with my mother.
Two weeks.
If I'm on a ship in the middle of nowhere, and something happens...
Please.
I can't lose this baby.
We'll have a listen.
The Doppler machine works like a radar, using soundwaves to tell us what's going on.
Lie back and pull up your blouse for me.
I don't know how you do it.
Difficult job, a husband and a baby, and you manage perfectly well.
Have a listen.
That's your baby's heartbeat.
160 beats a minute.
Oh, my goodness.
It's beautiful.
Yes.
Yes, it is.
Joan?
Did you get onto Jim?
I've called the number five times, and no-one answers.
I'm sure there's a good reason.
Was it a phone box?
A pub?
Did he say anything?
I don't know where he is.
I don't know if James is alright.
I don't know if he's coming back for the trial, if he wants me there, if I should look for him...
I don't know any of it.
He'll call again.
I keep going to the house, pretending like I'm keeping things going, like that'll bring him back.
Hey!
Are you going to that rally thing?
The peace march?
Possibly.
I don't know.
My dad's a soldier, isn't he?
Who told you that?
A nurse.
My dad might turn up at the march.
I don't think so.
There's gonna be heaps of people, bands and music, and all sorts of stuff.
It's a protest rally, not the Royal Easter Show.
Never been to either.
What do we want?
Troops out!
When do we want it?
Now!
What do we want?
Troops out!
When do we want it?
Now!
What do we want?
Troops out!
Among the students and Unionists who are marching here today against Australia's involvement in Vietnam are many who look like they've never demonstrated before.
What do we want?
Troops out!
When do we want it?
Now!
What do we want?
What do we want?
Troops out!
When do we want it?
Now!
Now!
Are you willing to go to gaol for this cause?
Yes, I am.
The war is wrong.
Innocent people are dying!
The government told us we'd only send advisors to this war!
Eight years on, 500 of our soldiers are dead!
What do we want?
Troops out!
When do we want it?
Now!
Many thousands of people will be protesting in Melbourne, and even more are expected here in Sydney.
The Moratorium Committee have emphasised that they want this to be a peaceful rally...
Bring our boys home again!
One, two, three, four!
We don't want war!
The police are certainly taking no chances and are out on the streets in large numbers.
Certainly, in the newsroom, we've taken a large number of calls from people who are dead against this march taking place and have made all kinds of threats.
Our government is lying!
They say it is a just war!
They say we are defending democracy.
They say we are defending freedom!
They say we are winning the war!
None of that is true!
None of it!
And one person who knows, because she's been there and just come home, is singer Annie Carmichael!
I'm outta here.
Thank you.
It's wonderful to see so many people here today.
There are orphanages in South
Vietnam overflowing with children, some of them no more than babies, who have had their parents killed by the North Vietnamese, by the Viet
Cong, and by American and Australian soldiers!
Many of these children are sick.
Many are malnourished.
And all of them have had their families destroyed!
Ladies and gentlemen, many of our soldiers don't even want to be in Vietnam!
They're conscripts, who have had the bad luck of having their birthday drawn out of a barrel by a politician!
I implore you to make your voices heard!
Write to your local members of parliament, and tell them you want us out of this war!
# There's something happening here
# What it is ain't exactly clear... #
Hey, careful!
Stop pushing!
Be careful!
# There's a man with a gun over there... #
Maggie...
Maggie!
What are you doing?
# Stop, children, what's that sound
# Everybody look what's going on... #
What the hell do you think you're doing!
I didn't do anything!
No, no!
She didn't do anything!
No!
She's pregnant!
# Stop, children, what's that sound
# Everybody look what's going on
# Stop, children, what's that sound
# Everybody... #
Annie!
Annie's been arrested and she didn't do anything.
It got pretty out of control.
Well, whatever happened, it wasn't Annie's fault.
Come on, Pete, there must be something you can do.
Please?
I don't know what you're so angry about.
That was fun!
Wipe that smile off your face.
Let go!
You're hurting my arm!
My friend is in lock-up for something you did.
At least have the sense to feel a bit of shame!
You've been out without permission.
Sorry, Matron.
My fault.
She had nits.
I took her to the hairdresser for a treatment.
You know the rules.
I looked, but I couldn't find you.
I'm so sorry.
Maggie, upstairs.
Strip your bed.
In fact, strip all the beds.
Then draw fresh linen and make them all up.
Yes, Matron.
Enjoy the work.
Hitting a cop got your attention.
I should try that again.
Dr Millar.
Are you free this afternoon?
Why?
I'm giving a talk at Sydney Uni on the latest reproductive strategies, and it occurred to me that you're across the IVF material.
I am.
If we showed our hand, we could hone our pitch to the hospital board.
If nothing else, it might take your mind off things.
Sure.
This case study you're using, is it Mrs Gordon?
That's her third miscarriage.
Incompetent cervix.
If she'd come in earlier...
I can't see anything in her history.
Her mother was probably given DES.
Diethylstilboestrol?
They've discovered it can cause incompetent cervix syndrome in women whose mothers took it.
It's supposed to prevent miscarriages, and now it's causing them.
There's an irony.
Are you sure?
Of course.
Why?
Joan!
Eva.
There's something I may have missed.
You can't go away.
I'm sorry.
Simon's moving to Canberra?
Are they short on doctors down there?
It was more of a diplomat's job, I think.
Sorry, I was a bit distracted.
I'm not late, am I?
Hi, Mum.
Simon's not here yet.
Where's Ernest?
He's working.
Short notice.
Sorry.
Hello.
That dress is lovely.
Thank you.
What have you brought?
Cheese and cabanossi on biscuits.
I was going to put cocktail onions on, but then I thought the biscuits might go soggy.
They'll be delicious, I'm sure.
Should I introduce you as Daisy or Carla?
Daisy.
Definitely Daisy.
Just look at my daughter.
About to marry a doctor.
A handsome doctor!
Yes.
Don't forget that bit!
Shall I drive?
No.
I hear you got another job.
What about you, Henry?
Any hobbies?
Used to collect stamps, 'till I realised it was a total and utter waste of time and money.
Martha likes watching the boxing.
Boxing's stupid.
Lionel Rose isn't stupid.
All boxers are stupid as a bowling ball.
I like cooking.
Big dill.
People say he takes after his mother.
She must have been lovely.
Yeah.
Kept me on a tight leash.
Those were the days.
Genetics.
Fascinating.
Mmm.
I've heard people say that sons often look more like their fathers.
Do you think that's true?
No!
It's a bloody lottery.
I mean, look at you two.
You're almost white, but Martha's black as coal!
Dad...
Martha's father was a Kamilaroi man.
Where is he?
He passed away.
I remarried.
Did you marry another black bloke?
No, actually.
Hmm.
The thing is, it's a dance of dominant and recessive genes.
You see, dark skin can pop up any time, generations down the track, regardless of interbreeding.
That's interesting.
Well, you would've talked about that with your new bloke.
Not really.
Does it matter?
Of course it bloody matters.
It's science.
I mean, your kids could be anything.
Black, white or brindle.
So what!
Excuse me.
I'm just gonna...
What the hell, Dad?
A word?
Please?
Go back inside.
I'll be alright.
He's just talking science stuff.
Doctors do that.
I don't think he was having a go at us.
He was having a go at your fiance.
That's how it happens sometimes.
What is it?
Ernest has left me.
When I told him the truth about who I was, he said he was fine.
But he wasn't.
He asked me to keep up the idea that I was Spanish.
I tried.
But I couldn't be something I wasn't anymore.
I'll take you home.
You're unbelievable!
You had that whole thing planned out!
Or are you that bad on the spur of the moment?
You're starting to sound just like your mother.
There's no surprises there.
She couldn't face the truth either.
Three weeks you had to deal with that lunch!
Three weeks you had to think about it.
But you couldn't help yourself!
What?
I was just talking about facts.
Bullshit!
All that dark skin crap, all the terrors of entertaining public servants!
They are facts, whether you like it or not.
Do you think life's gonna be easy with a black wife?
I know what people are like, but I love her.
I'll make sure she's alright!
As if love is ever enough.
An 'incompetent cervix'?
Makes it sound like it's just not trying.
It's most likely caused by the drug your mother was given.
And this operation?
A 'cerclage'.
It's basically threading a band around the cervix to stop it from opening prematurely.
You can have it done at another hospital if you want.
Every gynaecologist in the city knows Patrick.
If I go somewhere else, he's even more likely to find out.
I'll admit you under a different name.
If anyone asks, you're Mrs Sandra Holloway.
Now, I can't operate until Patrick's out of the hospital.
Until then, we'll lower the head of your bed down.
We'll raise your lower body, and that will take the pressure off your cervix.
And if I don't have the operation?
You'll lose the child.
Martha, I'm sorry.
I'm so, so, sorry.
Hey.
My dad just can't keep his big mouth shut.
Is your mum gonna be alright?
She will be.
OK.
Everything my dad said was wrong.
No.
It wasn't.
Oh, don't you start.
It was honest.
I like that.
Honest doesn't mean right.
Simon, he is right.
Having a black wife will be hard.
Have you really thought about that?
Yes!
But I'm gonna get this job in Canberra.
I'm gonna buy you a warm jumper and we're gonna have the best bloody life together!
I don't wanna have to have this conversation again!
But we've never really had this conversation.
The job in Canberra sounds fantastic.
But think about what happened at Dr
McNaughton's place, how you ended up pushing that bloke into the pool.
So what?
I love you!
But in 20 years' time?
I'll feel the same way.
You can't push all of Canberra into a pool.
It's not how the world works.
You were supposed to cover for Bowditch, but you were gone for more than an hour.
I know.
I'm sorry.
There was a personal emergency.
Your husband?
Have you heard something?
No, no, it's something else.
It's sorted now.
But I have so much work to catch up on.
Is there...is there anything I can do?
No.
You have that talk at the university.
Is that now?
You were gonna join me!
I'm sorry.
Next time.
Oh, Simon!
Perfect.
Uh...
Ah!
Sorry, but I need your help.
Now.
I need to see Annie Carmichael.
I'll deal with this.
Where is she?
You can't lock her up.
She's pregnant.
Well, between you and me, she's got a few dramas.
Assault police, resist arrest, offensive language...
And that's just for starters.
Well, you can get her out.
You know you can.
Oh.
Well, you know the deal.
If you come to the party, I'll see what I can do.
What did you do?
Nothing.
Right, it's here somewhere, but don't panic, I had a quick glance at it before, and I'm pretty sure it's good news.
Got your interview soon?
In an hour.
It's just a formality though?
Apparently.
Did...did Martha say she was worried about that?
No, no...
We didn't really talk much after the lunch.
Everything's gonna work out just fine.
Um...
Ah!
Here it is.
Good news, Pattie.
You're not pregnant.
Are you sure?
Yeah.
Yeah, one less thing to worry about, eh?
Yeah.
# Anyone who ever loved, could look at me... #
Here, Pattie, your turn.
My turn, my turn...
Read it out, read it out.
"Grab the nearest guy and kiss him!"
It's that guy.
He's the nearest.
Look at him.
Mr Dreamy.
Go on!
No, no, no, no, I am done with kissing boys.
I'm done.
Seems a shame to waste him.
Go on!
She's gonna do it!
It's your birthday.
Whoo-hoo!
So, I'm guessing the result from Simon came back.
Yep.
It's negative.
So I'm celebrating.
What about me?
What about you?
Go on, Annie.
I think you've earned it!
Hold this?
# Loving you the way I do
# I take you back, without you I'd die, dear
# Knowing I love you so
# Anyone who had a heart Would take me in his arms
# And love me too... #
Hi.
Four 'Martha's getting married' cocktails.
Put whatever you want in them, as long as it's alcohol.
No, I've gotta stay sober for the fight.
What fight?
Lionel Rose.
Not to worry, I'll have yours then.
# Oh, oh, oh, no...
# Oh, oh, oh...#
Thank you for getting Annie out today.
Well, she's your friend.
Nice veil.
Lift it and see what happens.
# Anyone who had a heart
# Would take me in his arms and love me too
# You couldn't really have a heart and hurt me
# Like you hurt me and be so untrue... #
Don't worry.
I'll be absolutely sober by the show tomorrow night.
I heard you got arrested.
I'll have to pay half those coppers to stay open.
You wanna fight them, get another job.
What?
Clear out your lipsticks and piss off!
# Anyone who had a heart would surely take me in his arms
# And always love me
# Why won't you?
#
Doctor.
Oh, Frances.
Today's surgical roster.
A cerclage in Theatre B.
Mrs Holloway?
Dr Millar operated.
Would you like me to enquire further?
No.
No, that's fine.
Thanks.
Leftovers.
There's still a lot of chicken, if you're hungry.
I've come to apologise.
I shouldn't have yelled at you.
I was saying hard things.
I went too far.
I...
I had my interview.
I'm exactly what they're looking for.
Of course you are.
Did you mention Martha?
They asked if I was attached.
You were right.
They made it clear.
They want me, but not with her.
So, a crossroads then.
Go on, hit him!
Rose has got it sewn up, without a doubt...
Hit him!
Hit him one side, hitting the other...
Yes!
Ah, yes, there's the bell!
And doesn't Lionel look confident?
It was his best performance since he beat
Fighting Harada in Tokyo...
How's he going?
Oh, he's won that one on points, for sure.
His career's back on track.
See?
You shouldn't have been so worried.
About anything.
Hey?
Mmm?
I promise you, in 20 years' time, we're gonna be happy, and we'll have a tribe of different-coloured kids.
And we're still gonna be in love.
OK?
And everything's just gonna work out the way we want it to.
A tribe of kids in Colombo?
Didn't get the job.
I'm so sorry.
It's OK.
I think they wanted someone a bit older.
Who knows, really?
Who knows.
Yeah.
Something else will come along.
Something better for the both of us.

Okay.
Turn on the ignition.
Yep.
Now clutch, and...
- What?
What?
- Clutch!
Clutch!
Turn it off.
That's called stalling.
You said I didn't have to have my foot on the clutch!
Yeah, that's when it's in neutral.
If it's in first gear...
- You didn't say that!
- I did.
- Didn't!
- D'you
- remember which one the clutch is?
- Of course I remember!
I'm not an idiot!
Is this good for us?
The whole car licence thing?
I mean, how do we get over this tension?
Another lesson tomorrow?
- Right.
- ..1965.
Rose has been struggling to recapture his form since his stunning victory after fighting
- Harada, but his...
- No, he hasn't!
Only the Olivares fight.
What about all the ones he's won?
- He can't lose!
- You and Lionel Rose, eh?
Is that why you wanted a TV?
But Lionel and I have something special.
- Ah?
- A blackfella who's the youngest-ever world champion?
A girl can't resist.
Hey, tomorrow...
You and Pattie all set?
Mm-hm.
I'm bringing my mum, and her husband.
It's not gonna be too scary, is it?
Uh...
I mean, it's only lunch.
Dad can be a bit...
But no, no, it'll be fine.
I'm bringing savouries.
Great!
Great.
Savouries are great.
But I don't wanna bring them if he thinks that I don't like his food and...
He'll like 'em.
He'll like 'em.
- Will he like me?
- Everyone likes you.
Not everyone likes him.
He can be a bit blunt.
Martha?
Oh, sorry.
Oh...
No, that's Okay.
I've gotta get to work anyway.
Hey, if Lionel Rose rocks up, you tell him you're spoken for!
Martha, if I've done something bad, will you promise not to judge me?
Of course!
What have you done?
I think I'm pregnant.

So, this is the married man you were telling me about, the one you kissed?
- Oh, we did a bit more than that.
- Obviously.
Please tell me I don't know him.
Otherwise I'll punch him.
- No, you don't.
- Are you still seeing him?
No.
And he knows nothing about this.
How far along are you?
I'm two weeks late, and my breasts feel bigger.
I'll tell Simon you're coming to see him.
- He could do a blood test.
- Oh...
Pattie, eventually everyone's going to know.
Have the test.
Maybe you're not pregnant.
Maybe you'll be lucky.
Yeah.
Maybe.
Are these for the Moratorium office?
These are for tomorrow.
Gotta set the record straight the Adelaide bunch.
I heard that went bad.
Police said the anarchists started it.
Right, while the cops threw flowers in the air!
This is good of you, Annie.
I appreciate it.
I'll see you tomorrow.
- Annie.
- Oh!
Are you walking?
- Say 'hello'.
- Hello!
Mwah!
Hey!
Have I told you how much I missed you?
You can tell me again, if you like.
So, who was that bloke?
- Dennis.
- Dennis.
Yeah.
He's helping with the anti-Vietnam rally tomorrow.
Deanna, have you got smiles for Mummy?
- We deserve cocktails tonight.
- Blue ones.
Yeah.
Celebrating.
Viv and Annie, home safe.
You look tired.
Are you Okay?
Yeah.
Just need a bit more sleep.
Did you hear anything about your baby nephew, back in Vietnam?
No.
You look great, though.
Positively glowing!
- Am I?
- Yeah!
- Wow.
- It's exertion.
I'm keeping

So, when's the shower tea?
We're having a hens' night instead.
It's a new thing.
It's like a buck's party.
So we get to go crazy, like boys do!
I get it.
We can tie Martha up and leave her somewhere embarrassing.
No, we can't.
Ladies and gentlemen, please make welcome our very own star, Miss Annie Carmichael, back from wowing the troops in Vietnam.
And make sure you're here early on Friday night for her show, because the place is sure to be packed!
Thank you.
I'm very much looking forward to singing for you.
Hope you are too.
But for a moment, let's think of our troops.
Many of them are conscripts who don't even wanna be there.
Thank you.
Annie, honey, you're still here because I sent you to Vietnam and made you a star.
You sing.
That's all.
Keep your bleeding-heart shit to yourself, Okay?
- Hey!
- Hey.
Heard you were back.
How are you?
Good, thank you.
How was Vietnam?
Oh, I mostly rolled bandages.
- New suit?
- Yeah, yeah.
Well, detective constable.
What do you think, hmm?
Why don't we start with a drink?
- Sure.
I'll...
- I'll get you one.
G'day.
Heard you joined the Moratorium Committee.
Yeah.
Who told you?
Come across a bloke named Dennis Tomlinson in your travels?
- Thin.
Long, shaggy hair?
- No.
- No?
- Why's that?
Just someone I wanna have a chat to.
Sorry, can't help you.
Enjoy your night.
How'd you sleep last night?
You still having bad dreams about your brother?
And Matthew.
Everything.
You should talk to someone.
I'm talking to you.
Anyone who wasn't over there won't understand.
Joan, you still Okay to cover my shift?
- Sure.
- It's not a whole shift.
Short family lunches are better than long family lunches.
I'm allergic to your mother's cat.
Can't your neighbour take it?
I'm asking you to feed it, Patrick, not kiss it.
Well, how long are you gonna be gone for?
- About two weeks.
- Two...
Dr Millar.
- Morning.
- I'm at Mum's until 2:00.
- I need to organise someone by then.
- Okay, fine.
I'll take it.
I'll feed the bloody cat.
Thank you.
Have a good holiday.
You Okay?
I realise this is a difficult time, so if there's anything I can do?
- If you need some time off...
- No, thanks.
I'm fine.
Jim called.
He gave me a phone number.
It's a Brisbane number.
He wanted to call you here, but he thought it might compromise you.
Call at 9:30.
He'll be waiting.
How is he?
And James?
Did he say?
They're fine.
He misses you.
Hi.
I'm organising something called a hens' night for Martha tonight.
It's sort of like a shower tea...
I'm sorry, Pattie, I need to make a phone call.
Oh, of course.
Actually, I'm...
I'm calling Jim.
- So...
- Oh.
Sorry.
Yeah, I'll leave you alone.
Come on, Jim.
Pick up.
Come on, pick up.
I thought you'd developed a passion for laparoscopy.
Sir?
Just been called about a reference for you.
A job with the Department of Foreign Affairs.
You're kidding.
I applied for that job months ago.
- I didn't think I had a chance!
- Apparently you do.
But if you want your boss to act as referee, it's a good idea to check with him first.
Oh...
I did.
Remember?
At the staff morning tea?
Maybe you thought I was joking.
Perhaps I did.
Check your pigeonhole.
They want to see you tonight.
Okay.
Am I early?
No.
No, now's good!
Now's absolutely bloody fantastic.
Come on.
Okay.
I'll be working out the feasibility of the field hospitals in countries we give aid to, and helping them set up.
It's my dream job.
Hold that.
You sure no-one will know that test is mine?
I'll take it straight to the lab.
How do you feel?
Like the first time I was pregnant.
Oh.
Don't go panicking yet.
We'll get the results late this afternoon.
- Sure you're alright?
- Yeah.
Hey, I know you don't want to go through the whole childbirth thing before you have to, but seriously, try not to worry.
You're two weeks late.
It's probably nothing.
- I'm...
I'm not worried, really.
- That's the ticket.
Hey... you can come and visit us in Canberra!
- Martha would like that.
- Yeah.
Yeah, me too.
- Beautiful day.
- You can feel summer coming.
- You been following me?
- No, no, no.
No, just out and about.
Did I hear you were up the north coast a couple of months back?
There was a horse substitution racket going on up there about that time.
Port Macquarie?
No, never been there.
That's odd.
Because this is you, taken on the day.
And that bloke there, that's the strapper who's coughed on you.
- What do you want?
- Dennis Tomlinson.
He's a communist.
He's a dangerous prick.
Word is, he's in town for the Moratorium marches and he's on the organising committee.
Annie doesn't know him.
She told you that.
If you can pass on any information that comes your way, I might be
- able to lose this photo.
- Yeah, I'm not a dog!
Well, how about this then, Chris?
You give me something I can use, or I'll lock you up for fraud.
Christopher!
Annie hasn't been in for her check-up.
She's good.
She's just busy.
And the baby?
Everything going well?
Yep.
You know I'm available to babysit, if you need it.
Yeah, I know.
I heard she's got a bee in her bonnet about the war.
Yep, along with a few other people.
Most of them are troublemakers and layabouts!
Well, that's not Annie, is it?
No.
Annie has an empty head she's filled with other people's ideas.
Well, lucky she doesn't give a shit what you think.
Dr Millar!
Joan, I've... had some sudden pains, like a cramp.
And... there's some blood.
This way.
So, it's just spotting?
Not heavy, like a period?
Just spots, that's all.
Is it bad?
Am I losing the baby?
I don't think so.
Any clots?
Cramps, pelvic pain...?
Just the one cramp.
I'm paranoid.
My mother had three miscarriages before they had me.
They had to give her a special drug.
Diethylstilboestrol?
Yes, I think that's it.
Should I have that?
I don't think so.
You don't have any other symptoms.
Some spotting in early pregnancy is common.
I'm going on a cruise this afternoon with my mother.
Two weeks.
If I'm on a ship in the middle of nowhere, and something happens...
Please.
I can't lose this baby.
We'll have a listen.
The Doppler machine works like a radar, using soundwaves to tell us what's going on.
Lie back and pull up your blouse for me.
I don't know how you do it.
Difficult job, a husband and a baby, and you manage perfectly well.
Have a listen.
That's your baby's heartbeat.
160 beats a minute.
Oh, my goodness.
It's beautiful.
Yes.
Yes, it is.
Joan?
Did you get onto Jim?
I've called the number five times, and no-one answers.
I'm sure there's a good reason.
Was it a phone box?
A pub?
Did he say anything?
I don't know where he is.
I don't know if James is alright.
I don't know if he's coming back for the trial, if he wants me there, if I should look for him...
I don't know any of it.
He'll call again.
I keep going to the house, pretending like I'm keeping things going, like that'll bring him back.
Hey!
Are you going to that rally thing?
The peace march?
Possibly.
I don't know.
My dad's a soldier, isn't he?
- Who told you that?
- A nurse.
My dad might turn up at the march.
- I don't think so.
- There's gonna be heaps of people, bands and music, and all sorts of stuff.
It's a protest rally, not the Royal Easter Show.
Never been to either.
- What do we want?
- Troops out!
- When do we want it?
- Now!
- What do we want?
- Troops out!
When do we want it?
- Now!
- What do we want?
- Troops out!
- Among the students and Unionists who are marching here today against Australia's involvement in Vietnam are many who look like they've never demonstrated before.
- What do we want?
- Troops out!
- When do we want it?
- Now!
- What do we want?
What do we want?
- Troops out!
- When do we want it?
- Now!
- Now!
- Are you willing to go to jaill for
- this cause?
- Yes, I am.
The war is wrong.
Innocent people are dying!
The government told us we'd only send advisors to this war!
Eight years on, 500 of our soldiers are dead!
What do we want?
Troops out!
- When do we want it?
- Now!
Many thousands of people will be protesting in Melbourne, and even more are expected here in Sydney.
The Moratorium Committee have emphasised that they want this to be a peaceful rally...
Bring our boys home again!
- One, two, three, four!
- We don't want war!
The police are certainly taking no chances and are out on the streets in large numbers.
Certainly, in the newsroom, we've taken a large number of calls from people who are dead against this march taking place and have made all kinds of threats.
Our government is lying!
They say it is a just war!
They say we are defending democracy.
They say we are defending freedom!
They say we are winning the war!
None of that is true!
None of it!
And one person who knows, because she's been there and just come home, is singer Annie Carmichael!
I'm outta here.
Thank you.
It's wonderful to see so many people here today... there are orphanages in South
Vietnam overflowing with children, some of them no more than babies, who have had their parents killed by the
North Vietnamese, by the Viet Cong, and by American and Australian soldiers!
Many of these children are sick.
Many are malnourished.
And all of them have had their families destroyed!
Ladies and gentlemen, many of our soldiers don't even want to be in Vietnam!
They're conscripts, who have had the bad luck of having their birthday drawn out of a barrel by a politician!
I implore you to make your voices heard!
Write to your local members of parliament, and tell them you want us out of this war!

Annie!
Annie's been arrested and she didn't do anything.
It got pretty out of control.
Well, whatever happened, it wasn't Annie's fault.
Come on, Pete, there must be something you can do.
Please?
I don't know what you're so angry about.
That was fun!
- Wipe that smile off your face.
- Let go!
You're hurting my arm!
My friend is in lock-up for something you did.
At least have the sense to feel a bit of shame!
You've been out without permission.
Sorry, Matron.
My fault.
She had nits.
I took her to the hairdresser for a treatment.
- You know the rules.
- I looked, but I couldn't find you.
I'm so sorry.
Maggie, upstairs.
Strip your bed.
In fact, strip all the beds.
Then draw fresh linen and make them all up.
Yes, Matron.
Enjoy the work.
Hitting a cop got your attention.
I should try that again.
Dr Millar.
- Are you free this afternoon?
- Why?
I'm giving a talk at Sydney Uni on the latest reproductive strategies, and it occurred to me that you're across the IVF material.
- I am.
- If we showed our hand, we could hone our pitch to the hospital board.
If nothing else, it might take your mind off things.
Sure.
This case study you're using, is it Mrs Gordon?
That's her third miscarriage.
Incompetent cervix.
If she'd come in earlier...
I can't see anything in her history.
Her mother was probably given DES.
Diethylstilboestrol?
They've discovered it can cause incompetent cervix syndrome in women whose mothers took it.
It's supposed to prevent miscarriages, and now it's causing them.
There's an irony.
- Are you sure?
- Of course.
Why?
Joan!
Eva.
There's something I may have missed.
You can't go away.
I'm sorry.
Simon's moving to Canberra?
Are they short on doctors down there?
It was more of a diplomat's job, I think.
Sorry, I was a bit distracted.
- I'm not late, am I?
- Hi, Mum.
Simon's not here yet.
Where's Ernest?
He's working.
Short notice.
Sorry.
Hello.
That dress is lovely.
Thank you.
What have you brought?
Cheese and cabanossi on biscuits.
I was going to put cocktail onions on, but then I thought the biscuits might go soggy.
They'll be delicious, I'm sure.
Should I introduce you as Daisy or Carla?
Daisy.
Definitely Daisy.
Just look at my daughter.
About to marry a doctor.
A handsome doctor!
Yes.
Don't forget that bit!
- Shall I drive?
- No.
I hear you got another job.
What about you, Henry?
Any hobbies?
Used to collect stamps, 'till I realised it was a total and utter waste of time and money.
Martha likes watching the boxing.
Boxing's stupid.
Lionel Rose isn't stupid.
All boxers are stupid as a bowling ball.
I like cooking.
Big dill.
People say he takes after his mother.
- She must have been lovely.
- Yeah.
- Kept me on a tight leash.
- Those were the days.
- Genetics.
Fascinating.
- Mmm.
I've heard people say that sons often look more like their fathers.
- Do you think that's true?
- No!
It's a bloody lottery.
I mean, look at you two.
You're almost white,
- but Martha's black as coal!
- Dad...
Martha's father was a Kamilaroi man.
Where is he?
He passed away.
- I remarried.
- Did you marry another black bloke?
- No, actually.
- Hmm.
The thing is, it's a dance of dominant and recessive genes.
You see, dark skin can pop up any time, generations down the track, regardless of interbreeding.
- That's interesting.
- Well, you would've talked about that with your new bloke.
- Not really.
- Does it matter?
Of course it bloody matters.
It's science.
I mean, your kids could be anything.
Black, white or brindle.
So what!
Excuse me.
I'm just gonna...
What the hell, Dad?
A word?
Please?
Go back inside.
I'll be alright.
He's just talking science stuff.
Doctors do that.
I don't think he was having a go at us.
He was having a go at your fiance.
That's how it happens sometimes.
What is it?
Ernest has left me.
When I told him the truth about who I was, he said he was fine.
But he wasn't.
He asked me to keep up the idea that I was Spanish.
I tried.
But I couldn't be something I wasn't anymore.
I'll take you home.
You're unbelievable!
You had that whole thing planned out!
Or are you that bad on the spur of the moment?
You're starting to sound just like your mother.
There's no surprises there.
She couldn't face the truth either.
Three weeks you had to deal with that lunch!
Three weeks you had to think about it.
But you couldn't help yourself!
What?
I was just talking about facts.
Bullshit!
All that dark skin crap, all the terrors of entertaining public servants!
They are facts, whether you like it or not.
Do you think life's gonna be easy with a black wife?
I know what people are like, but I love her.
I'll make sure she's alright!
As if love is ever enough.
An 'incompetent cervix'?
Makes it sound like it's just not trying.
It's most likely caused by the drug your mother was given.
- And this operation?
- A 'cerclage'.
It's basically threading a band around the cervix to stop it from opening prematurely.
You can have it done at another hospital if you want.
Every gynaecologist in the city knows Patrick.
If I go somewhere else, he's even more likely to find out.
I'll admit you under a different name.
If anyone asks, you're Mrs Sandra Holloway.
Now, I can't operate until Patrick's out of the hospital.
Until then, we'll lower the head of your bed down.
We'll raise your lower body, and that will take the pressure off your cervix.
And if I don't have the operation?
You'll lose the child.
Martha, I'm sorry.
I'm so, so, sorry.
Hey.
My dad just can't keep his big mouth shut.
- Is your mum gonna be alright?
- She will be.
Okay.
Everything my dad said was wrong.
- No.
It wasn't.
- Oh, don't you start.
- It was honest.
I like that.
- Honest doesn't mean right.
Simon, he is right.
Having a black wife will be hard.
Have you really thought about that?
Yes!
But I'm gonna get this job in Canberra.
I'm gonna buy you a warm jumper and we're gonna have the best bloody life together!
I don't wanna have to have this conversation again!
But we've never really had this conversation.
The job in Canberra sounds fantastic.
But think about what happened at Dr. McNaughton's place, how you ended up pushing that bloke into the pool.
- So what?
I love you!
- But in 20 years' time?
I'll feel the same way.
You can't push all of Canberra into a pool.
It's not how the world works.
You were supposed to cover for Bowditch, but you were gone for more than an hour.
I know.
I'm sorry.
There was a personal emergency.
Your husband?
Have you heard something?
No, no, it's something else.
It's sorted now.
But I have so much work to catch up on.
Is there... is there anything I can do?
No.
You have that talk at the university.
Is that now?
You were gonna join me!
I'm sorry.
Next time.
Oh, Simon!
Perfect.
Uh...
Ah!
Sorry, but I need your help.
Now.
I need to see Annie Carmichael.
I'll deal with this.
Where is she?
You can't lock her up.
She's pregnant.
Well, between you and me, she's got a few dramas.
Assault police, resist arrest, offensive language...
And that's just for starters.
Well, you can get her out.
- You know you can.
- Oh.
Well, you know the deal.
If you come to the party, I'll see what I can do.
What did you do?
Nothing.
Right, it's here somewhere, but don't panic, I had a quick glance at it before, and I'm pretty sure it's good news.
Got your interview soon?
In an hour.
It's just a formality though?
Apparently.
Did... did Martha say she was worried about that?
No, no...
We didn't really talk much after the lunch.
Everything's gonna work out just fine.
Um...
Ah!
Here it is.
Good news, Pattie.
You're not pregnant.
Are you sure?
Yeah.
Yeah, one less thing to worry about, eh?
Yeah.
♪ Anyone who ever loved, could look at me... ♪

No, no, no, no, I am done with kissing boys.
I'm done.
Seems a shame to waste him.
- Go on!
- She's gonna do it!
It's your birthday.
Whoo-hoo!
So, I'm guessing the result from Simon came back.
Yep.
It's negative.
So I'm celebrating.

Today's surgical roster.
A cerclage in Theatre B.
Mrs Holloway?
Dr Millar operated.
Would you like me to enquire further?
No.
No, that's fine.
Thanks.
Leftovers.
There's still a lot of chicken, if you're hungry.
I've come to apologise.
I shouldn't have yelled at you.
I was saying hard things.
I went too far.
I...
I had my interview.
I'm exactly what they're looking for.
Of course you are.
Did you mention Martha?
They asked if I was attached.
You were right.
They made it clear.
They want me, but not with her.
So, a crossroads then.
Go on, hit him!
Rose has got it sewn up, without a doubt...
- Hit him!
- Hit him one side, hitting the other...
Yes!
Ah, yes, there's the bell!
And doesn't Lionel look confident?
It was his best performance since he beat
Fighting Harada in Tokyo...
- How's he going?
- Oh, he's won that one on points, for sure.
His career's back on track.
See?
You shouldn't have been so worried.
About anything.
- Hey?
- Mmm?
I promise you, in 20 years' time, we're gonna be happy, and we'll have a tribe of different-coloured kids.
And we're still gonna be in love.
Okay?
And everything's just gonna work out the way we want it to.
A tribe of kids in Colombo?
Didn't get the job.
I'm so sorry.
It's Okay.
I think they wanted someone a bit older.
Who knows, really?
Who knows.
Yeah.
Something else will come along.
Something better for the both of us.
Oh.
Morning.
Morning.
Don't miss the trade agreement.
Page three.
It's finally happening. (chuckles)
(elevator bell dings)
Uh-oh.
More than three of you.
It's not bad news.
We just have a few things to discuss with you.
For your trip to Myanmar.
You're only the third secretary of state to visit in 50 years, you know.
And the first who gets to sign the Pacific Rim Trade Agreement.
Boom.
I'm just experimenting with that.
"Boom" is over, man.
You missed it.
Daisy, what's up with page three?
Why isn't it bigger news than that?
Believe me, when you sign the agreement, it'll be front page, above the fold.
There is just one small fly in the ointment.
I can't believe I kicked that football.
The meet and greet at the elevator... always bad news.
Who's the fly?
Ambassador Arlen Maxwell.
In my office?
BLAKE:
No, in Myanmar.
He's called a few times today.
He has some ethical concerns about the trade agreement.
He does?
Yes.
The U.S. ambassador to Myanmar, whose job it is to represent U.S. interests in Myanmar, has some ethical concerns about the landmark trade agreement.
Upon which everyone has agreed.
You know, I've spoken to him a few times.
He seems reasonable enough.
- What's going on?
- I think the ambassador might have something referred to as clientitis.
He's identifying closely with the culture and its people.
Let's nip it in the bud, and...
Blake, get me the ambassador, will you?
So, is there anything else that I should know?
Yes.
He and President Dalton have been friends since college.
Maxwell inherited a large sum of money and invested it in some high-risk enterprises.
One of them paid off.
A very deep gold mine in Argentina.
MATT:
Now, word is, he got lucky.
His wife divorced him two years ago.
No prenup.
Talk about a very deep gold mine.
So when the ambassadorship came up, he called his old friend the president and asked to be sent to Myanmar.
- Maybe for a change of scenery?
- I'm guessing to escape the tabloids.
Their divorce was a splashy story.
To be fair to the president, a number of candidates turned down the post.
Myanmar is a very poor country a long way from anything.
- Unless you're a fan of temples.
- MATT:
Look, there's no way this rube is gonna mess up the trade agreement.
I had to rewrite an entire Billy Joel song
- just to make it happen.
- Yeah.
And we had to sing it.
- Don't you mean you got to sing it?
- Don't worry, Matt.
It won't be for naught.
This agreement is going to go through.
Ambassador Maxwell.
Great.
Thanks, everybody.
- Thank you.
- Ma'am.
Ambassador, I'm looking forward to meeting you in person in the next couple of days.
And I you, Madam Secretary.
Uh, now, may I ask, have you... have you read, uh, this report put out by your State Department?
Well, I-I have to be honest with you.
The State Department puts out thousands of documents, feels like every day.
Well, this is called
The World in 2030, and I just...
I have to tell you, it's not a pretty world, particularly for Myanmar, after we sign this trade agreement.
What in particular about the trade agreement bothers you?
Elimination of tariffs on hydro-power turbines.
Let's start there.
Yes.
So that hydroelectric dams can be built, leading to the modernization of Myanmar's power grid.
At the cost of displacing whole villages of people.
People who have been farmers all their lives.
It's... it is all right in here.
But with the modernization to the cities, industry can thrive.
And it will help close the enormous wealth gap and, in turn, raise the standard of living for everyone.
We're talking about generations of people who have only lived close to the land.
Ambassador Maxwell, I understand.
This agreement, it isn't perfect, but at the end of the day, the positive effects clearly outweighed the negative.
Well, I can tell you, there is a large segment of people who live here who do not agree.
Even President Shwe, even he has concerns.
Concerns that have been resolved through hours of conversation and reviewing the data.
President Shwe got on board for a very good reason.
If Conrad would call me back...
President Dalton has entrusted me with this agreement, but I assure you that he is fully committed to it.
And I promise you that this is an agreement that you can represent to the people of Myanmar proudly.
See you then.
(computer beeps)
I don't know how we missed this.
We didn't.
I read it when it came out.
But probably just before I read the joint CIA and FBI projection of the ten most imminent terrorist attacks on U.S. soil.
I do have to prioritize my end of the world documents, you know.
It's somebody's job in every department to game out worst-case scenarios.
It's not supposed to be taken as hard science.
Water is featured as a megatrend starting on page 380.
ELIZABETH:
See, that's good.
Write that down.
We just... we just need to remind the ambassador of the counterpoints.
Why are we humoring this guy?
Because these big trade agreements are very fragile when you have so many countries involved.
And the last thing we need is a skittish ambassador.
If his concerns get out and they're taken as a sign that the United States has doubts, it could make others reevaluate, not to mention embarrass the hell out of us.
No kidding.
"2030, nearly half the world's population will live in areas of severe water stress."
The trade agreement is going to allow us to send in scientists to help shore up erosion.
It's all in the speech I wrote for the ceremony.
It's solid.
We just need talking points to ease the ambassador's mind.
Sure.
No problem.
I love that answer.
BLAKE:
Spider monkeys will be extinct?
Somebody take that away from Blake.
(line beeps)
Hi, it's me.
Uh, I called before, but I didn't leave a message.
Um, maybe you didn't recognize the number.
So, it looks like
I'm going to be in your neck of the woods... soon.
And, um, it would be very nice to see you.
Anyway, I'll be there, uh, day after tomorrow.
And...
I-I look forward to seeing you.
Okay.
Um... bye.
Damn it.
Oh, Madam Secretary!
Listen, I'm just heading home.
I need those, uh, talking points e-mailed to me.
But, um, or Jay can bring them tomorrow.
Uh, that's what I wanted to talk to you about.
I'll be joining you on your trip to Myanmar instead of Jay.
Oh.
Okay.
But everything all right?
Oh, it's fine.
I just thought he could use a break from all the traveling.
The baby's teething... incisors.
- It's painful.
- Yeah, those are the tough ones.
- Yeah.
- What's the real reason?
(chuckles, clears throat)
I recently found out that my son has been living in Myanmar for the last few months.
Your son?
From a very brief affair when I was touring Europe with a dance troupe.
Dance troupe?
Before law school.
Anyway, he quit Juilliard years ago and has been traveling around and wound up in Myanmar, as luck would have it.
You know, you and I really should have gone out for a drink at some point.
I like to keep my private life private, ma'am.
You've done a superb job.
Um, I'm glad you're coming.
That'll be great, and I look forward
- to maybe meeting your son.
- Oh, thank you.
Be honored to introduce you to him if I can coax him out.
He's an artist, so he's anti everything we stand for.
Oh.
I've got a budding one of those myself.
(elevator bell dings)
See you tomorrow, Madam Secretary.
Okay.
I am off to the treaty signing in Myanmar.
Okay.
Cool.
Sounds good.
What's the time difference there?
11 and a half hours.
Wow.
Guess everybody's over the gig, huh?
Kind of got it down by now, Mom.
Obviously.
Jason isn't even here.
He's getting donuts with the Dudes.
It's their jam.
STEVIE:
If we were upset, then you would feel torn between your family and your career, and is that what you really want?
(phone ringing)
Is there something in the middle?
Just go and have another wonderful history-making trip and come home soon.
Oh, security.
Hey, Kevin.
What's up?
Bye.
Bye.
Yeah, okay.
Yeah, be right there.
Our neighbor Ted is outside.
He wants to see us.
It's a little late for the welcome basket.
Never too late for a welcome.
Come on.
You're so much nicer than I am.
Yes, I am.
Hello, Ted.
Come on in.
Sorry about the whole security thing.
Thanks, guys.
Can I get you a cup of coffee?
I'm here on neighborhood business.
Oh.
Okay.
Your residence has violated a number of our homeowners' association bylaws, such as your security taking up much of our street parking
24 hours a day, the removal of trash cans without permission, and the unsightly cones that are placed in the street, to name a few.
It's all in the complaint, but the worst is
Madam Secretary's SUV, which is left running 24 hours a day, adding unwanted air and noise pollution.
Well, that's a hell of an icebreaker, Ted.
Why don't you come in?
I'm sure it's our fault for not getting to know you guys.
We kind of hit the ground running.
We keep talking about having a dinner party.
We do.
We talk about that.
I have to get to work.
We're having a meeting on Saturday to vote on whether or not we need to explore our legal options with regard to these complaints.
You're welcome to attend.
ELIZABETH:
You want us to move?
Seriously?
HENRY:
I'm sure they're not saying that.
Henry, they're saying that.
Right here.
It's-it's one of the options we've listed.
Well, I am sure that you'll find that the Fair Housing Act won't support those options.
I'll tell you what, Ted.
Why don't we host the meeting here at our house on Saturday?
We can have brunch and get to know everybody, work everything out.
We're not looking for a party, Mr. McCord.
Doctor.
Dr. McCord.
What party?
It's eggs and mimosas and solving some problems.
All right.
I'll send out an e-mail to the members.
Great.
How could they not like us?
People like us.
Do you remember our old neighborhood?
They called us the Merry McCords.
Oh...
Okay, I hated it.
But now I miss it.
I mean, we're likeable!
NADINE:
So you'll have about an hour with
Ambassador Maxwell before the reception.
And just a reminder about protocol here.
Men and women do not kiss cheeks in greeting.
No touching of the heads or feet.
And in the presence of the elderly, don't spit.
I can't make any promises.
I just can't.
I... (laughs)
(crowd chanting in Burmese)
(man chanting in Burmese over loudspeaker)
What's going on?
Some kind of demonstration, ma'am.
NADINE:
I'll call Ambassador Maxwell and find out.
Wait.
(chanting continues)
Maybe we can just wave him over.
Oh, dear God.
(chanting continues)
Didn't he have hair the other day?
Maybe we can keep this from the Myanmar authorities.
(siren toots, chanting continues)
Or not.
(chanting)
(chanting continues)
The Arlen Maxwell I talked to the other day didn't look like that.
What happened?
He periodically wears the robes.
The shaved head is new.
(buzzer sounds)
Oh.
He had his teacher do it this morning.
His teacher?
Yes.
Ashin Tun.
He's a Buddhist monk.
Ambassador Maxwell converted to Theravada Buddhism about six months ago?
Well, his religion is his own business, but inciting a demonstration against his own country's policies is...
I want to say insane, I do.
You have to understand,
Ambassador Maxwell didn't come here with the idea to live a cushy life in the embassy.
He wanted to immerse himself in local life and-and culture.
He's a man of the people.
He's an ambassador for the American people.
Well, I think he's come to think of the Myanmar people as his people.
ELIZABETH:
Well, I think he should rethink that.
He's meditating.
Is he?
Mr. Ambassador?
Elizabeth McCord.
Secretary of State.
I'm so sorry to intrude on your downtime.
Arlen, do you think I haven't taken a yoga class?
I know you can hear me.
Madam Secretary, I'm happy to meet you.
What were you thinking?
Inciting a demonstration against the very work you were appointed to support?
I tried to share my concerns with you.
And when I didn't embrace them, your next step was to humiliate the president?
The right response to injustice is civil disobedience.
I came fully prepared to have a reasonable discussion with you, but since your new beliefs don't seem to include reasonable discussion, I am telling you that you are officially removed from your post.
So when you get released from here, you can pack your bags and head off to the monastery.
Good day.
All is as it should be.
Yeah, well, we'll see about that.
Yes, Mr. President, I am as surprised as...
Well, I-I spoke with an aide
- from President Shwe's office...
- (phone chimes) ...and there has been no change in schedule.
As soon as the agreement is signed, I'll call.
(sighs)
Sir, it is a good deal.
In all fairness, sir, I-I don't think anyone could have anticipated a U.S. ambassador leading a demonstration against his own country.
(phone chimes)
With that said,
I'm gonna do everything I can to...
Sir?
Sir?
(phone whooshes)
The president hung up on me.
I'm sure he doesn't blame you.
No, no, he does.
I need to get back to the embassy and check in with the foreign ministers, make sure that the agreement still stands.
We have... three hours until the signing.
Matt and Daisy are working on a boilerplate press release.
Something about the ambassador wanting to spend more time with his family.
Good.
And for once, we can be thankful for a government that controls the media.
There won't be any press about the demonstration.
Have you read this thing?
Enough to get the gist of it.
Why?
I was up all night.
DAISY:
Wait.
You read the whole thing?
It's like a horror film.
Bioterror weaponry, diseases that jump from animals to humans, accelerated climate change, demon robots who will take over the world.
Well, a demon robot is welcome to take over my world as long as he cleans my bathroom and organizes my stuff.
You know, I'm gonna get a 3-D printer, use it to make another 3-D printer, then return the first one.
- I'm no fool.
- And forget about bombs.
Okay?
'Cause hacking is gonna be the new bomb.
Because banks won't be able to keep up with all the new hacking techniques.
Which means we'll have to pay in cash for everything.
Which means piles and piles of cash in every home.
Which means guns in every home.
Which means shootouts in the middle of the street.
It's gonna be like the Wild West out there!
Dude.
These doom and gloom predictions happen all the time.
You can't lose any sleep over it.
I suggest you take a second look at that thing.
Look, I'll just go with head in the sand.
Okay.
All right, just... just hope that sand isn't in Miami.
Because it'll all be underwater.
(indistinct chatter)
Oh, hello.
Um, I'm not sure if I have the right address.
Uh...
You are Roman's mother?
I'm Shindy.
I'm Nadine.
Is my son here?
I am sorry.
He had band practice.
Are you his girlfriend?
I am.
We've been together for six months.
Oh, I see.
And you're from here?
Oh, of course, you're from here.
Unless you're not from here.
I'm sorry, I'm very sorry.
I don't mean to assume.
It's all right.
I was born and raised here.
Ah.
How is he?
Uh, he's fine.
I'll tell him you stopped by.
Thank you.
Oh, um... would you please give him this?
It's all the information of where I'm staying.
My hotel, all the numbers where he can reach me.
I have to leave tomorrow.
I would love to see him.
I'll tell him.
Thank you.
It's lovely to have met you.
You, too.
(indistinct chatter)
She seems nice.
Mr. President, thank you for seeing me.
It was good of you to come to say good-bye.
Of course, of course.
My being here has been an honor.
It's changed my life.
I have to tell you, Mr. President, you cannot sign that trade agreement.
Mr. Maxwell, may I point out to you that 12 countries have sent heads of state to sign this agreement in two hours.
That may be in their best interest.
But I can tell you this agreement is not in Myanmar's best interest.
Even Secretary McCord expressed her doubts about it.
Really?
With me, she was quite steadfast.
This is a predominantly Buddhist country.
The Noble Truths should be your guide as you plan for the future.
Let me remind you that one of those truths is
"Don't struggle to get what you want, but modify your wanting."
I wish you a safe trip home to your country.
I'm sorry, Mr. President.
Uh, I, I have to keep struggling.
My work here is not done.
Everybody out or the president dies!
Get out!
Get out!
Out!
Get out!
(indistinct shouting)
(sirens wailing)
Madam Secretary, how was your...?
What's going on?
The president has been taken hostage.
What?
By whom?
By the American ambassador.
(sirens wailing)
The ambassador has a gun to President Shwe's head.
And this action seems to be linked to the trade agreement.
(sighs) Are we sure the gun is real?
Where's a Buddhist even get a firearm?
Probably brought it with him from when he was an average American citizen.
Can we talk to him?
He is demanding that we cancel the signing of the trade agreement.
No discussion.
And he won't pick up the phone.
Any idea how to get through to a gun-wielding Buddhist?
No.
But I know someone who might.
MALE REPORTER:
Ambassador Maxwell's excuse to meet with President Shwe
- was that he wanted to pay - (phone ringing) his respects and say good-bye.
But at some point he pulled a gun...
Babe, are you okay?
Yes, I'm far enough away from the action.
Unbelievable.
I guess hostage taking is the new form of negotiation.
It is definitely becoming a trend.
Henry, I need you to tell me everything
I need to know about Buddhism in the next five minutes.
Look, I don't know what this guy's doing, but he is not practicing Buddhism.
Yeah, well, he thinks he is.
So just tell me.
Okay.
There are six realms divided into 31 planes of existence...
Henry.
The point is, it's not a five-minute conversation.
Well...
I need something.
Some way to reach him.
Maybe, what about a Buddhist quote?
Or-or-or-or a Buddhist teaching?
Just something to talk him down.
You just want me to reach into my grab bag of religious quotes?
Why not?
You do it all the time!
It's adorable.
I quote when it makes sense in context.
Henry, please.
I can't just watch him kill somebody.
Or be killed himself.
He's not gonna listen to you anyway.
You're not his teacher or his mentor or a monk, so...
He-he mentioned that he had a teacher.
Well, your best bet is to find him.
Theravada Buddhism emphasizes heeding the advice of the wise.
Okay, I'm gonna...
I'm gonna get on that.
Listen, uh, I hate to bring this up, but, um... safe bet, you're not gonna make it home by tomorrow morning.
Oh, crap.
The brunch.
Don't worry about it.
We'll cancel.
Oh, no, no, no.
We cannot cancel.
That would look like I'm...
The secretary of state?
(sighs)
Listen, the last thing that I need right now is a conflict on my own street.
Okay, like I said, it's just eggs and mimosas.
It's easy.
Okay, and you know what?
I'm gonna send Blake just for good measure.
Okay, well, don't worry about it.
We'll handle it.
And, um, I'd never thought I'd say this, but, uh.... don't get too close to the Buddhist terrorist.
Don't worry, I won't.
I love you.
Nadine, I need you to track down Arlen Maxwell's teacher.
I think his aide said he was a Buddhist monk...
Ashin Tun...
I made a note of it.
Good.
And I-I don't care what you have to do to get him here, just get him here.
Yes, ma'am.
It's 12 hours and counting since this volatile situation began in Naypyidaw, Myanmar... formerly known as Burma... where American Ambassador Arlen Maxwell has taken the president of this country hostage.
The United States government has condemned
Ambassador Maxwell's actions, which occurred after he was released from his post...
Dr. McCord, any change?
Not yet.
(TV shuts off)
On the upside, my quiches are perfect.
And I cleaned the kitchen.
You're welcome.
Well, I'm all set up, if you want to have a look.
Sure.
So I have a 15-slide PowerPoint called
"The Upside of Diplomatic Security."
- Uh, would you like a quick preview?
- Actually,
I really have to go study.
So the quiches are on the counter and all you have to do is cut them and serve them.
(doorbell rings)
Sergio and Alice.
Three doors down.
Hi.
Sergio, Alice?
Henry McCord.
Very nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you, finally.
Uh, new Tesla.
Hey, how do you like that Tesla of yours?
- It's fast, right?
- Too fast.
I'm going to get in trouble in that car.
Oh, I hear you.
I've been wanting to test-drive one of those.
Please, stop by.
- He'll take you for a spin.
- Really?
I'll take you up on that.
Please, come on in
- and make yourself at home.
- Thanks.
Gary and Margo.
Big garden.
Hi.
Uh, Gary, Margo?
Henry McCord.
I love your garden.
- Thank you.
- Beautiful.
Please, come in.
And of course, the Rhodes,
Ted and Ginny.
Hi, Ted.
I'm really glad we could do this.
And you must be Ginny.
It's so nice to finally meet you.
I'm really glad we could do this.
Please, make yourself... at home.
(exhales)
You're really good at this.
Well, I welcome the distraction.
From what?
You don't want to know.
I mean, did you know that there are more plastic flamingos than real flamingos in this world?
What?
What?
Don, Tina.
Hi, Don.
Hi, Tina.
Henry McCord.
Come on in.
So for all the inconvenience that a strong security detail may bring to the neighborhood, it also cuts crime rates in the following ways.
A nine percent decrease in automobile break-ins.
A 15% decrease in home break-ins...
ALICE:
What about all the foot traffic from the tourists?
Right.
- Yeah, like every day.
- Strangers, roaming our streets.
BLAKE:
Strangers who actually raise the resale value of your home by an impressive 12%.
Remember, a famous area is a desirable area.
Now, here's a surprising yet charming statistic.
There's actually a four percent decrease in lost pets.
(laughter and indistinct chatter)
TED:
This is all very interesting, but, uh, we were led to believe that the secretary herself would be here.
Where is she?
That-that was certainly our plan, but unfortunately my wife was held up by the hostage situation in Myanmar.
What a mess.
How did that happen?
SERGIO:
Is that trade agreement really a good idea?
It sounds like they're gonna send a lot of jobs overseas.
- (neighbors clamoring)
- Let's not drift into politics.
Let's not drift...
He's right, let's not.
We're here to talk about how the secretary's lifestyle is interfering with our own.
Alice, you were saying that your garbage bins are constantly being moved by the security guys.
Well, yes, I assume it's them.
TED:
And the tourists are actually picking
Gary and Margo's prize roses.
ALICE:
Oh, it's terrible.
TED:
And they've caught them on camera, actually.
Not to mention the worst problem of all, which is the caravan of SUVs out front.
MARGO:
It is difficult to have a dinner party.
ALICE:
Also, my dog wakes up and barks every time the secretary leaves or comes home, which is all hours of the day.
Oh, please.
Tell me again about your barking dog while violent hurricanes pound millions and millions of homes up and down the East Coast, uprooting and displacing people, forcing them into these makeshift, disease-ridden little shantytowns right here in your own upscale Georgetown neighborhood!
Okay, thank you very much, Blake.
Thank you.
Um, why don't we take five?
There's some pastries and coffee in the kitchen.
No, let's talk about the environment.
Let's talk about your SUVs running day and night, spewing carbon monoxide
- into the air 24 hours a day.
- That is a protocol issue.
They have to be kept running in the event of a state emergency.
Give me a break!
I'm sure your wife is too important to care about my son's asthma, but shouldn't she care about climate change?
- Isn't that part of her job, too?
- (neighbors murmur agreement)
I was hoping that this would be a reasonable discussion where we could all get to know each other and come up with some creative ideas about how to live together.
But it's turned into a platform for you to voice your opinions about foreign policy and elevate your mundane concerns
- to global importance...
- (protesting) ...because my wife happens to be the secretary of state.
"Mundane concerns"?
Yeah, Ted.
Your garbage bins?
Really?
Dinner parties?
I'm sorry my house is a little busy because matters of national security really don't take a day off.
There are dangers that you will never know about because there are people out there working to make sure you're never affected by it.
People who are putting their lives at risk every day.
So why don't we all just take a time-out and then, if you still want to petition us to move out of the neighborhood, go with God.
Good luck with that.
- Okay, everybody out.
- Let's get out of here, honey.
What?
Out?
Come on, let's go.
- Let's go.
- Let's all go.
(indistinct chatter)
Great diplomacy, guys.
Really.
Top-notch.
(front door closes)
The teacher Ashin Tun has been received by Mr. Maxwell.
A conversation ensued among the three of them.
Now, if you care to rest, the president and the teacher appear to be meditating.
The idea was that the teacher was going to counsel Mr. Maxwell.
We brought him in at your request, Madam Secretary.
What happened after that is not up to us.
NADINE:
President Shwe and Mr. Maxwell want to talk to you.
It's a secure line.
This is Secretary of State McCord.
I believe the hard work has paid off, Madam Secretary.
You must be exhausted.
Why don't you put the gun down and let's...
let's all talk?
Look, I know that I'm probably going to prison for the rest of my life, but I am ready to face that possibility if I know that I have created a better agreement for my new home and people.
Arlen, clearly, you-you care very much about these changes, so why don't you come out and let's discuss them?
Madam Secretary, are you aware of the sutta of the Middle Way?
I think that it's, um, similar to what the Greeks call the golden mean.
Moderation in all things.
It's the road between sensual indulgence and self-mortification.
It's... it is the path we should all seek.
And I have been successful in, uh, getting the president to understand that.
What does that mean?
He agrees that these hydroelectric dams are... they're just... they're a bad idea for his people.
Well, if the president is convinced, we can... absolutely take a look at making an amendment.
But we can't talk about anything while President Shwe has a gun to his head.
It's not the president's attention that I need now.
It's yours.
And when I show you on a map, uh, the-these-these areas that will be flooded and these poor people who will lose ev... (gunshot)
Arlen, what was that?
Arlen?
(shouting)
I lost him.
The police chief isn't answering.
Nor is Arlen's aide.
I...
Nothing reported on any news source.
The president is unharmed.
Oh, thank God.
What about Maxwell?
Mr. Maxwell let his guard down as he spoke to you.
The snipers were able to wound him.
He is being treated.
He will recover.
The president wishes to see you immediately.
Of course.
(phone chimes)
The important thing is that you're all right.
And we all deeply regret
Mr. Maxwell's actions.
But we came here for a specific reason
- that carries great international...
- Madam Secretary, I must tell you that the reluctance that I voiced to Mr. Maxwell was genuine.
In order for Myanmar to sign this agreement, it must be amended to address the problem of the possible hydroelectric dams.
This agreement was based on hard data from every nation.
They predict that these hydroelectric dams will modernize your power grid, which will, in turn, help Myanmar to take better care of all of its citizens.
You and I both know why China was so interested in eliminating tariffs on hydropower turbines.
So that they could be the one to build the hydroelectric dams, using their technology and their labor.
And perhaps claim Myanmar's future water rights.
Mr. President, there is something in this agreement for every country.
That's how we got here.
I have a clearer picture now.
Signing this agreement is a short-term solution which will lead to much greater problems down the road.
I-I know that you are aware that it's too late to change the terms now, but perhaps we can use Myanmar's labor force to build the dams.
And at this point, Mr. President, there's no reason to suspect that China will lay claim to a sovereign nation's water rights.
Tell that to the African nations where China is buying up all their land.
Have you read The World in 2030, put out by your own State Department?
Water is the future's most precious commodity.
So for the good of my people and future generations,
I must withdraw my support for this agreement.
If you could visit some of our villages... (indistinct chatter)
Oh, it's okay.
Thank you.
I was worried.
I'm flattered.
Seriously?
Oh, I didn't mean it that way.
I...
I really wasn't sure...
That I care about my own mother?
Why do you have to be so dramatic?
Roman, you haven't returned my calls in... a few years, now.
What about when you stopped speaking to me when I dropped out of Juilliard?
That's ancient history!
I was angry then.
I was afraid I'd say something I'd regret.
And when I tried to get back in touch with you,
- you wouldn't hear of it.
- You disowned me.
I didn't disown you.
I cut you off financially.
If you were adult enough to drop out of school, then you were adult enough to support yourself.
You were mad because I abandoned your dream.
No, no.
You wanted Juilliard as much as I did.
That is not true.
And Dad was totally understanding when I changed my mind.
Yeah, well, he wasn't paying for it.
It always comes back to money.
I was a single mother and a government worker.
I didn't have endless resources.
I saved from the time you were born to give my only child a college education, and you took that gift and threw it away.
I didn't throw anything away.
I'm using what I learned there.
You're just so prosaic.
It's like nothing counts unless it's some kind of pedigree.
(sighs)
Okay.
Okay.
(clears throat)
You're right.
I don't fully understand it, but I'm going to trust that you know what you're doing.
Anything to end this fight.
I want to have a relationship with you.
Well, how are we supposed to do that?
We keep talking to each other.
You return my calls, I won't mention Juilliard.
Can we do that?
I guess.
(phone chimes)
Ugh!
I'm sorry, I have to go back in.
I love you.
I get that.
I do.
NADINE:
I apologize, Madam Secretary.
It was my son.
(chuckles) He was worried.
Oh.
Understandable.
Is he okay?
Yeah.
Where are we with President Shwe?
It's over.
We're going home without a trade agreement.
Called the president;
I'm not sure the hearing in that ear will ever recover.
He's got a lot of nerve holding you accountable.
He's the one who put an unstable person in that post.
You got to see your son.
It wasn't a total waste.
Yeah, we'll see.
The truth is, ma'am, um... we've been estranged for a while.
But I wanted to mend fences, so I had to suck it up.
I kept my eye on the bigger picture.
(sighs) And you know what?
He met me halfway.
At least in theory.
That's good.
You found the Middle Way.
That's a Buddhist principle I was lectured on by a guy holding a gun to someone's head.
It's one thing to talk about, quite another to put into practice.
Yeah, it is.
I'll start making arrangements to go home.
Uh, first, Nadine, see if you can get the Chinese foreign minister on the phone.
Yes, ma'am.
Thank you, guys.
(groans)
Anybody home?
Just me.
Well, that'll do.
Are you okay, babe?
Yeah.
- Ouch.
- Oh.
I'm a little tired.
I'm sure you are.
I saw the news.
You put that trade agreement back together.
What happened?
I had an epiphany.
I found the Middle Way.
Oh, my God.
You're a Buddhist.
(both chuckle)
More like a... suck-it-upist.
Since when?
Well, after President Shwe changed his mind about the agreement, I managed to work a side deal with the Chinese to protect
Myanmar's water rights.
So, by prostrating myself and taking all the blame, which I did not deserve,
everybody signed and there you go.
Wow.
History made.
That's great.
Congratulations.
Mm.
Thank you.
(sighs)
I couldn't pull things off with the neighbors.
Well, there's... still time.
What, you want to employ the "suck it up" strategy with them?
While it's working, yes.
I may have incinerated the Middle Way.
Well, there's only one way to find out.
What in the world are...?
How do these things get so out of order?
It's the alphabet, people.
You're still upset about the 2030 report?
Rising sea levels, displaced people, economic upheaval?
Yeah, it's staying with me.
If you want to bury yourself in work, the secretary has a real assignment for us.
Yes, please.
We need to get to the bottom of why the SUVs are left running outside her house.
There has to be a way to stop that.
I tried.
Oh.
After the evil brunch, I did some research.
It would take mountains of paperwork, questions from Congress and at least six months of waiting.
Most likely to be turned down.
Huh.
Well... in that case, there's only one thing left to do.

You know, when I was a little girl, we didn't have fire drills.
We had nuclear bomb drills.
Duck and cover.
Duck under the desk and cover your head.
(laughs) As if that would've helped.
(sighs)
We were all absolutely convinced that one day we would all die in a nuclear war.
(groans):
Oh.
We just lived with it.
Oh, we... tried to get the most out of our time, but we just hoped and prayed for the best.
I studied the Cold War.
It's a miracle it didn't happen.
Oh, partly.
There were other things.
The SALT talks.
Ongoing negotiations among world leaders.
The Berlin Wall eventually came down, seemingly out of nowhere, but really... it had to do with a lot of people making good moves at the right time.
And yet here we are again, making a big mess of everything, and if we don't change our ways, then yes, it will be the stuff of nightmares.
But if we turned things around once,
I believe we can do it again.
Sometimes... you have to have faith in people.
Do not ever tell anyone I said that.
(laughs)
Yes, ma'am.
(music ends, woman laughs)
(crowd cheering)
Meanwhile, that's why God created alcohol and music.
Now, get up there and sing.
(chuckles)
Uh, why?
(sighs)
Because you can.

Hi.
MATT:
Can I help you, Madam Secretary, Dr. McCord?
Yeah.
Matt, I was wondering if maybe you guys could shut off the motors for the night?
No, ma'am.
It's protocol.
I'm not kidding.
This is important.
I'll tell you what, if you get in trouble,
- you just blame it on me, okay?
- I'm sorry, ma'am.
I'm not authorized to do that.
Hey, have you called Conrad to tell him the trade agreement is finalized?
Yeah, he was in a meeting, so I left a message at the office.
Uh, he's probably home by now.
It's this whole thing with the neighbors, Matt.
They-they don't like the cars running all the time.
The poor guy's kid has asthma.
Well, be that as it may, Dr. McCord,
I don't work for your neighbors.
That's true.
Technically, I don't even work for Secretary McCord.
(chuckles):
That's true, too, technically.
ELIZABETH:
Just hold on one second.
Um, Matt, the president would like a word.
Yes, Mr. President?
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
I understand.
Right-right away, sir.
Good-bye.
(engine stops)
Thanks, Matt.
I'll tell the other guys.
Have a good night.
(chuckles)
(sighs):
Oh.
I like the Middle Way.
That was not the Middle Way.
That was winning.
Well, I like that, too. (chuckles)
Oh.
Morning.
Morning.
Don't miss the trade agreement.
Page three.
It's finally happening.
Uh-oh.
More than three of you.
It's not bad news.
We just have a few things to discuss with you.
For your trip to Myanmar.
You're only the third secretary of state to visit in 50 years, you know.
And the first who gets to sign the Pacific Rim Trade Agreement.
Boom.
I'm just experimenting with that.
"Boom" is over, man.
You missed it.
Daisy, what's up with page three?
Why isn't it bigger news than that?
Believe me, when you sign the agreement, it'll be front page, above the fold.
There is just one small fly in the ointment.
I can't believe I kicked that football.
The meet and greet at the elevator... always bad news.
Who's the fly?
Ambassador Arlen Maxwell.
In my office?
No, in Myanmar.
He's called a few times today.
He has some ethical concerns about the trade agreement.
He does?
Yes.
The U.S. ambassador to Myanmar, whose job it is to represent U.S. interests in Myanmar, has some ethical concerns about the landmark trade agreement.
Upon which everyone has agreed.
You know, I've spoken to him a few times.
He seems reasonable enough.
- What's going on?
- I think the ambassador might have something referred to as clientitis.
He's identifying closely with the culture and its people.
Let's nip it in the bud, and...
Blake, get me the ambassador, will you?
So, is there anything else that I should know?
Yes.
He and President Dalton have been friends since college.
Maxwell inherited a large sum of money and invested it in some high-risk enterprises.
One of them paid off.
A very deep gold mine in Argentina.
Now, word is, he got lucky.
His wife divorced him two years ago.
No prenup.
Talk about a very deep gold mine.
So when the ambassadorship came up, he called his old friend the president and asked to be sent to Myanmar.
- Maybe for a change of scenery?
- I'm guessing to escape the tabloids.
Their divorce was a splashy story.
To be fair to the president, a number of candidates turned down the post.
Myanmar is a very poor country a long way from anything.
- Unless you're a fan of temples.
- Look, there's no way this rube is gonna mess up the trade agreement.
I had to rewrite an entire Billy Joel song
- just to make it happen.
- Yeah.
And we had to sing it.
- Don't you mean you got to sing it?
- Don't worry, Matt.
It won't be for naught.
This agreement is going to go through.
Ambassador Maxwell.
Great.
Thanks, everybody.
- Thank you.
- Ma'am.
Ambassador, I'm looking forward to meeting you in person in the next couple of days.
And I you, Madam Secretary.
Uh, now, may I ask, have you... have you read, uh, this report put out by your State Department?
Well, I-I have to be honest with you.
The State Department puts out thousands of documents, feels like every day.
Well, this is called
The World in 2030, and I just...
I have to tell you, it's not a pretty world, particularly for Myanmar, after we sign this trade agreement.
What in particular about the trade agreement bothers you?
Elimination of tariffs on hydro-power turbines.
Let's start there.
Yes.
So that hydroelectric dams can be built, leading to the modernization of Myanmar's power grid.
At the cost of displacing whole villages of people.
People who have been farmers all their lives.
It's... it is all right in here.
But with the modernization to the cities, industry can thrive.
And it will help close the enormous wealth gap and, in turn, raise the standard of living for everyone.
We're talking about generations of people who have only lived close to the land.
Ambassador Maxwell, I understand.
This agreement, it isn't perfect, but at the end of the day, the positive effects clearly outweighed the negative.
Well, I can tell you, there is a large segment of people who live here who do not agree.
Even President Shwe, even he has concerns.
Concerns that have been resolved through hours of conversation and reviewing the data.
President Shwe got on board for a very good reason.
If Conrad would call me back...
President Dalton has entrusted me with this agreement, but I assure you that he is fully committed to it.
And I promise you that this is an agreement that you can represent to the people of Myanmar proudly.
See you then.
I don't know how we missed this.
We didn't.
I read it when it came out.
But probably just before I read the joint CIA and FBI projection of the ten most imminent terrorist attacks on U.S. soil.
I do have to prioritize my end of the world documents, you know.
It's somebody's job in every department to game out worst-case scenarios.
It's not supposed to be taken as hard science.
Water is featured as a megatrend starting on page 380.
See, that's good.
Write that down.
We just... we just need to remind the ambassador of the counterpoints.
Why are we humoring this guy?
Because these big trade agreements are very fragile when you have so many countries involved.
And the last thing we need is a skittish ambassador.
If his concerns get out and they're taken as a sign that the United States has doubts, it could make others reevaluate, not to mention embarrass the hell out of us.
No kidding.
"2030, nearly half the world's population will live in areas of severe water stress."
The trade agreement is going to allow us to send in scientists to help shore up erosion.
It's all in the speech I wrote for the ceremony.
It's solid.
We just need talking points to ease the ambassador's mind.
Sure.
No problem.
I love that answer.
Spider monkeys will be extinct?
Somebody take that away from Blake.
Hi, it's me.
Uh, I called before, but I didn't leave a message.
Um, maybe you didn't recognize the number.
So, it looks like
I'm going to be in your neck of the woods... soon.
And, um, it would be very nice to see you.
Anyway, I'll be there, uh, day after tomorrow.
And...
I-I look forward to seeing you.
Okay.
Um... bye.
Damn it.
Oh, Madam Secretary!
Listen, I'm just heading home.
I need those, uh, talking points e-mailed to me.
But, um, or Jay can bring them tomorrow.
Uh, that's what I wanted to talk to you about.
I'll be joining you on your trip to Myanmar instead of Jay.
Oh.
Okay.
But everything all right?
Oh, it's fine.
I just thought he could use a break from all the traveling.
The baby's teething... incisors.
- It's painful.
- Yeah, those are the tough ones.
- Yeah.
- What's the real reason?
I recently found out that my son has been living in Myanmar for the last few months.
Your son?
From a very brief affair when I was touring Europe with a dance troupe.
Dance troupe?
Before law school.
Anyway, he quit Juilliard years ago and has been traveling around and wound up in Myanmar, as luck would have it.
You know, you and I really should have gone out for a drink at some point.
I like to keep my private life private, ma'am.
You've done a superb job.
Um, I'm glad you're coming.
That'll be great, and I look forward
- to maybe meeting your son.
- Oh, thank you.
Be honored to introduce you to him if I can coax him out.
He's an artist, so he's anti everything we stand for.
Oh.
I've got a budding one of those myself.
See you tomorrow, Madam Secretary.
Okay.
I am off to the treaty signing in Myanmar.
Okay.
Cool.
Sounds good.
What's the time difference there?
11 and a half hours.
Wow.
Guess everybody's over the gig, huh?
Kind of got it down by now, Mom.
Obviously.
Jason isn't even here.
He's getting donuts with the Dudes.
It's their jam.
If we were upset, then you would feel torn between your family and your career, and is that what you really want?
Is there something in the middle?
Just go and have another wonderful history-making trip and come home soon.
Oh, security.
Hey, Kevin.
What's up?
Bye.
Bye.
Yeah, okay.
Yeah, be right there.
Our neighbor Ted is outside.
He wants to see us.
It's a little late for the welcome basket.
Never too late for a welcome.
Come on.
You're so much nicer than I am.
Yes, I am.
Hello, Ted.
Come on in.
Sorry about the whole security thing.
Thanks, guys.
Can I get you a cup of coffee?
I'm here on neighborhood business.
Oh.
Okay.
Your residence has violated a number of our homeowners' association bylaws, such as your security taking up much of our street parking
24 hours a day, the removal of trash cans without permission, and the unsightly cones that are placed in the street, to name a few.
It's all in the complaint, but the worst is
Madam Secretary's SUV, which is left running 24 hours a day, adding unwanted air and noise pollution.
Well, that's a hell of an icebreaker, Ted.
Why don't you come in?
I'm sure it's our fault for not getting to know you guys.
We kind of hit the ground running.
We keep talking about having a dinner party.
We do.
We talk about that.
I have to get to work.
We're having a meeting on Saturday to vote on whether or not we need to explore our legal options with regard to these complaints.
You're welcome to attend.
You want us to move?
Seriously?
I'm sure they're not saying that.
Henry, they're saying that.
Right here.
It's-it's one of the options we've listed.
Well, I am sure that you'll find that the Fair Housing Act won't support those options.
I'll tell you what, Ted.
Why don't we host the meeting here at our house on Saturday?
We can have brunch and get to know everybody, work everything out.
We're not looking for a party, Mr. McCord.
Doctor.
Dr. McCord.
What party?
It's eggs and mimosas and solving some problems.
All right.
I'll send out an e-mail to the members.
Great.
How could they not like us?
People like us.
Do you remember our old neighborhood?
They called us the Merry McCords.
Oh...
Okay, I hated it.
But now I miss it.
I mean, we're likeable!
So you'll have about an hour with
Ambassador Maxwell before the reception.
And just a reminder about protocol here.
Men and women do not kiss cheeks in greeting.
No touching of the heads or feet.
And in the presence of the elderly, don't spit.
I can't make any promises.
I just can't.
I...
What's going on?
Some kind of demonstration, ma'am.
I'll call Ambassador Maxwell and find out.
Wait.
Maybe we can just wave him over.
Oh, dear God.
Didn't he have hair the other day?
Maybe we can keep this from the Myanmar authorities.
Or not.
The Arlen Maxwell I talked to the other day didn't look like that.
What happened?
He periodically wears the robes.
The shaved head is new.
Oh.
He had his teacher do it this morning.
His teacher?
Yes.
Ashin Tun.
He's a Buddhist monk.
Ambassador Maxwell converted to Theravada Buddhism about six months ago?
Well, his religion is his own business, but inciting a demonstration against his own country's policies is...
I want to say insane, I do.
You have to understand,
Ambassador Maxwell didn't come here with the idea to live a cushy life in the embassy.
He wanted to immerse himself in local life and-and culture.
He's a man of the people.
He's an ambassador for the American people.
Well, I think he's come to think of the Myanmar people as his people.
Well, I think he should rethink that.
He's meditating.
Is he?
Mr. Ambassador?
Elizabeth McCord.
Secretary of State.
I'm so sorry to intrude on your downtime.
Arlen, do you think I haven't taken a yoga class?
I know you can hear me.
Madam Secretary, I'm happy to meet you.
What were you thinking?
Inciting a demonstration against the very work you were appointed to support?
I tried to share my concerns with you.
And when I didn't embrace them, your next step was to humiliate the president?
The right response to injustice is civil disobedience.
I came fully prepared to have a reasonable discussion with you, but since your new beliefs don't seem to include reasonable discussion, I am telling you that you are officially removed from your post.
So when you get released from here, you can pack your bags and head off to the monastery.
Good day.
All is as it should be.
Yeah, well, we'll see about that.
Yes, Mr. President, I am as surprised as...
Well, I-I spoke with an aide from President Shwe's office and there has been no change in schedule.
As soon as the agreement is signed, I'll call.
Sir, it is a good deal.
In all fairness, sir, I-I don't think anyone could have anticipated a U.S. ambassador leading a demonstration against his own country.
With that said,
I'm gonna do everything I can to...
Sir?
Sir?
The president hung up on me.
I'm sure he doesn't blame you.
No, no, he does.
I need to get back to the embassy and check in with the foreign ministers, make sure that the agreement still stands.
We have... three hours until the signing.
Matt and Daisy are working on a boilerplate press release.
Something about the ambassador wanting to spend more time with his family.
Good.
And for once, we can be thankful for a government that controls the media.
There won't be any press about the demonstration.
Have you read this thing?
Enough to get the gist of it.
Why?
I was up all night.
Wait.
You read the whole thing?
It's like a horror film.
Bioterror weaponry, diseases that jump from animals to humans, accelerated climate change, demon robots who will take over the world.
Well, a demon robot is welcome to take over my world as long as he cleans my bathroom and organizes my stuff.
You know, I'm gonna get a 3-D printer, use it to make another 3-D printer, then return the first one.
- I'm no fool.
- And forget about bombs.
Okay?
'Cause hacking is gonna be the new bomb.
Because banks won't be able to keep up with all the new hacking techniques.
Which means we'll have to pay in cash for everything.
Which means piles and piles of cash in every home.
Which means guns in every home.
Which means shootouts in the middle of the street.
It's gonna be like the Wild West out there!
Dude.
These doom and gloom predictions happen all the time.
You can't lose any sleep over it.
I suggest you take a second look at that thing.
Look, I'll just go with head in the sand.
Okay.
All right, just... just hope that sand isn't in Miami.
Because it'll all be underwater.
Oh, hello.
Um, I'm not sure if I have the right address.
Uh...
You are Roman's mother?
I'm Shindy.
I'm Nadine.
Is my son here?
I am sorry.
He had band practice.
Are you his girlfriend?
I am.
We've been together for six months.
Oh, I see.
And you're from here?
Oh, of course, you're from here.
Unless you're not from here.
I'm sorry, I'm very sorry.
I don't mean to assume.
It's all right.
I was born and raised here.
Ah.
How is he?
Uh, he's fine.
I'll tell him you stopped by.
Thank you.
Oh, um... would you please give him this?
It's all the information of where I'm staying.
My hotel, all the numbers where he can reach me.
I have to leave tomorrow.
I would love to see him.
I'll tell him.
Thank you.
It's lovely to have met you.
You, too.
She seems nice.
Mr. President, thank you for seeing me.
It was good of you to come to say good-bye.
Of course, of course.
My being here has been an honor.
It's changed my life.
I have to tell you, Mr. President, you cannot sign that trade agreement.
Mr. Maxwell, may I point out to you that 12 countries have sent heads of state to sign this agreement in two hours.
That may be in their best interest.
But I can tell you this agreement is not in Myanmar's best interest.
Even Secretary McCord expressed her doubts about it.
Really?
With me, she was quite steadfast.
This is a predominantly Buddhist country.
The Noble Truths should be your guide as you plan for the future.
Let me remind you that one of those truths is
"Don't struggle to get what you want, but modify your wanting."
I wish you a safe trip home to your country.
I'm sorry, Mr. President.
Uh, I, I have to keep struggling.
My work here is not done.
Everybody out or the president dies!
Get out!
Get out!
Out!
Get out!
Madam Secretary, how was your...?
What's going on?
The president has been taken hostage.
What?
By whom?
By the American ambassador.
The ambassador has a gun to President Shwe's head.
And this action seems to be linked to the trade agreement.
Are we sure the gun is real?
Where's a Buddhist even get a firearm?
Probably brought it with him from when he was an average American citizen.
Can we talk to him?
He is demanding that we cancel the signing of the trade agreement.
No discussion.
And he won't pick up the phone.
Any idea how to get through to a gun-wielding Buddhist?
No.
But I know someone who might.
Ambassador Maxwell's excuse to meet with President Shwe was that he wanted to pay his respects and say good-bye.
But at some point he pulled a gun...
Babe, are you okay?
Yes, I'm far enough away from the action.
Unbelievable.
I guess hostage taking is the new form of negotiation.
It is definitely becoming a trend.
Henry, I need you to tell me everything
I need to know about Buddhism in the next five minutes.
Look, I don't know what this guy's doing, but he is not practicing Buddhism.
Yeah, well, he thinks he is.
So just tell me.
Okay.
There are six realms divided into 31 planes of existence...
Henry.
The point is, it's not a five-minute conversation.
Well...
I need something.
Some way to reach him.
Maybe, what about a Buddhist quote?
Or-or-or-or a Buddhist teaching?
Just something to talk him down.
You just want me to reach into my grab bag of religious quotes?
Why not?
You do it all the time!
It's adorable.
I quote when it makes sense in context.
Henry, please.
I can't just watch him kill somebody.
Or be killed himself.
He's not gonna listen to you anyway.
You're not his teacher or his mentor or a monk, so...
He-he mentioned that he had a teacher.
Well, your best bet is to find him.
Theravada Buddhism emphasizes heeding the advice of the wise.
Okay, I'm gonna...
I'm gonna get on that.
Listen, uh, I hate to bring this up, but, um... safe bet, you're not gonna make it home by tomorrow morning.
Oh, crap.
The brunch.
Don't worry about it.
We'll cancel.
Oh, no, no, no.
We cannot cancel.
That would look like I'm...
The secretary of state?
Listen, the last thing that I need right now is a conflict on my own street.
Okay, like I said, it's just eggs and mimosas.
It's easy.
Okay, and you know what?
I'm gonna send Blake just for good measure.
Okay, well, don't worry about it.
We'll handle it.
And, um, I'd never thought I'd say this, but, uh.... don't get too close to the Buddhist terrorist.
Don't worry, I won't.
I love you.
Nadine, I need you to track down Arlen Maxwell's teacher.
I think his aide said he was a Buddhist monk...
Ashin Tun...
I made a note of it.
Good.
And I-I don't care what you have to do to get him here, just get him here.
Yes, ma'am.
It's 12 hours and counting since this volatile situation began in Naypyidaw, Myanmar... formerly known as Burma... where American Ambassador Arlen Maxwell has taken the president of this country hostage.
The United States government has condemned
Ambassador Maxwell's actions, which occurred after he was released from his post...
Dr. McCord, any change?
Not yet.
On the upside, my quiches are perfect.
And I cleaned the kitchen.
You're welcome.
Well, I'm all set up, if you want to have a look.
Sure.
So I have a 15-slide PowerPoint called
"The Upside of Diplomatic Security."
- Uh, would you like a quick preview?
- Actually,
I really have to go study.
So the quiches are on the counter and all you have to do is cut them and serve them.
Sergio and Alice.
Three doors down.
Hi.
Sergio, Alice?
Henry McCord.
Very nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you, finally.
Uh, new Tesla.
Hey, how do you like that Tesla of yours?
- It's fast, right?
- Too fast.
I'm going to get in trouble in that car.
Oh, I hear you.
I've been wanting to test-drive one of those.
Please, stop by.
- He'll take you for a spin.
- Really?
I'll take you up on that.
Please, come on in
- and make yourself at home.
- Thanks.
Gary and Margo.
Big garden.
Hi.
Uh, Gary, Margo?
Henry McCord.
I love your garden.
- Thank you.
- Beautiful.
Please, come in.
And of course, the Rhodes,
Ted and Ginny.
Hi, Ted.
I'm really glad we could do this.
And you must be Ginny.
It's so nice to finally meet you.
I'm really glad we could do this.
Please, make yourself... at home.
You're really good at this.
Well, I welcome the distraction.
From what?
You don't want to know.
I mean, did you know that there are more plastic flamingos than real flamingos in this world?
What?
What?
Don, Tina.
Hi, Don.
Hi, Tina.
Henry McCord.
Come on in.
So for all the inconvenience that a strong security detail may bring to the neighborhood, it also cuts crime rates in the following ways.
A nine percent decrease in automobile break-ins.
A 15% decrease in home break-ins...
What about all the foot traffic from the tourists?
Right.
- Yeah, like every day.
- Strangers, roaming our streets.
Strangers who actually raise the resale value of your home by an impressive 12%.
Remember, a famous area is a desirable area.
Now, here's a surprising yet charming statistic.
There's actually a four percent decrease in lost pets.
This is all very interesting, but, uh, we were led to believe that the secretary herself would be here.
Where is she?
That-that was certainly our plan, but unfortunately my wife was held up by the hostage situation in Myanmar.
What a mess.
How did that happen?
Is that trade agreement really a good idea?
It sounds like they're gonna send a lot of jobs overseas.
Let's not drift into politics.
Let's not drift...
He's right, let's not.
We're here to talk about how the secretary's lifestyle is interfering with our own.
Alice, you were saying that your garbage bins are constantly being moved by the security guys.
Well, yes, I assume it's them.
And the tourists are actually picking
Gary and Margo's prize roses.
Oh, it's terrible.
And they've caught them on camera, actually.
Not to mention the worst problem of all, which is the caravan of SUVs out front.
It is difficult to have a dinner party.
Also, my dog wakes up and barks every time the secretary leaves or comes home, which is all hours of the day.
Oh, please.
Tell me again about your barking dog while violent hurricanes pound millions and millions of homes up and down the East Coast, uprooting and displacing people, forcing them into these makeshift, disease-ridden little shantytowns right here in your own upscale Georgetown neighborhood!
Okay, thank you very much, Blake.
Thank you.
Um, why don't we take five?
There's some pastries and coffee in the kitchen.
No, let's talk about the environment.
Let's talk about your SUVs running day and night, spewing carbon monoxide
- into the air 24 hours a day.
- That is a protocol issue.
They have to be kept running in the event of a state emergency.
Give me a break!
I'm sure your wife is too important to care about my son's asthma, but shouldn't she care about climate change?
Isn't that part of her job, too?
I was hoping that this would be a reasonable discussion where we could all get to know each other and come up with some creative ideas about how to live together.
But it's turned into a platform for you to voice your opinions about foreign policy and elevate your mundane concerns to global importance because my wife happens to be the secretary of state.
"Mundane concerns"?
Yeah, Ted.
Your garbage bins?
Really?
Dinner parties?
I'm sorry my house is a little busy because matters of national security really don't take a day off.
There are dangers that you will never know about because there are people out there working to make sure you're never affected by it.
People who are putting their lives at risk every day.
So why don't we all just take a time-out and then, if you still want to petition us to move out of the neighborhood, go with God.
Good luck with that.
- Okay, everybody out.
- Let's get out of here, honey.
What?
Out?
Come on, let's go.
- Let's go.
- Let's all go.
Great diplomacy, guys.
Really.
Top-notch.
The teacher Ashin Tun has been received by Mr. Maxwell.
A conversation ensued among the three of them.
Now, if you care to rest, the president and the teacher appear to be meditating.
The idea was that the teacher was going to counsel Mr. Maxwell.
We brought him in at your request, Madam Secretary.
What happened after that is not up to us.
President Shwe and Mr. Maxwell want to talk to you.
It's a secure line.
This is Secretary of State McCord.
I believe the hard work has paid off, Madam Secretary.
You must be exhausted.
Why don't you put the gun down and let's...
let's all talk?
Look, I know that I'm probably going to prison for the rest of my life, but I am ready to face that possibility if I know that I have created a better agreement for my new home and people.
Arlen, clearly, you-you care very much about these changes, so why don't you come out and let's discuss them?
Madam Secretary, are you aware of the sutta of the Middle Way?
I think that it's, um, similar to what the Greeks call the golden mean.
Moderation in all things.
It's the road between sensual indulgence and self-mortification.
It's... it is the path we should all seek.
And I have been successful in, uh, getting the president to understand that.
What does that mean?
He agrees that these hydroelectric dams are... they're just... they're a bad idea for his people.
Well, if the president is convinced, we can... absolutely take a look at making an amendment.
But we can't talk about anything while President Shwe has a gun to his head.
It's not the president's attention that I need now.
It's yours.
And when I show you on a map, uh, the-these-these areas that will be flooded and these poor people who will lose ev...
Arlen, what was that?
Arlen?
I lost him.
The police chief isn't answering.
Nor is Arlen's aide.
I...
Nothing reported on any news source.
The president is unharmed.
Oh, thank God.
What about Maxwell?
Mr. Maxwell let his guard down as he spoke to you.
The snipers were able to wound him.
He is being treated.
He will recover.
The president wishes to see you immediately.
Of course.
The important thing is that you're all right.
And we all deeply regret
Mr. Maxwell's actions.
But we came here for a specific reason
- that carries great international...
- Madam Secretary, I must tell you that the reluctance that I voiced to Mr. Maxwell was genuine.
In order for Myanmar to sign this agreement, it must be amended to address the problem of the possible hydroelectric dams.
This agreement was based on hard data from every nation.
They predict that these hydroelectric dams will modernize your power grid, which will, in turn, help Myanmar to take better care of all of its citizens.
You and I both know why China was so interested in eliminating tariffs on hydropower turbines.
So that they could be the one to build the hydroelectric dams, using their technology and their labor.
And perhaps claim Myanmar's future water rights.
Mr. President, there is something in this agreement for every country.
That's how we got here.
I have a clearer picture now.
Signing this agreement is a short-term solution which will lead to much greater problems down the road.
I-I know that you are aware that it's too late to change the terms now, but perhaps we can use Myanmar's labor force to build the dams.
And at this point, Mr. President, there's no reason to suspect that China will lay claim to a sovereign nation's water rights.
Tell that to the African nations where China is buying up all their land.
Have you read The World in 2030, put out by your own State Department?
Water is the future's most precious commodity.
So for the good of my people and future generations,
I must withdraw my support for this agreement.
If you could visit some of our villages...
Oh, it's okay.
Thank you.
I was worried.
I'm flattered.
Seriously?
Oh, I didn't mean it that way.
I...
I really wasn't sure...
That I care about my own mother?
Why do you have to be so dramatic?
Roman, you haven't returned my calls in... a few years, now.
What about when you stopped speaking to me when I dropped out of Juilliard?
That's ancient history!
I was angry then.
I was afraid I'd say something I'd regret.
And when I tried to get back in touch with you,
- you wouldn't hear of it.
- You disowned me.
I didn't disown you.
I cut you off financially.
If you were adult enough to drop out of school, then you were adult enough to support yourself.
You were mad because I abandoned your dream.
No, no.
You wanted Juilliard as much as I did.
That is not true.
And Dad was totally understanding when I changed my mind.
Yeah, well, he wasn't paying for it.
It always comes back to money.
I was a single mother and a government worker.
I didn't have endless resources.
I saved from the time you were born to give my only child a college education, and you took that gift and threw it away.
I didn't throw anything away.
I'm using what I learned there.
You're just so prosaic.
It's like nothing counts unless it's some kind of pedigree.
Okay.
Okay.
You're right.
I don't fully understand it, but I'm going to trust that you know what you're doing.
Anything to end this fight.
I want to have a relationship with you.
Well, how are we supposed to do that?
We keep talking to each other.
You return my calls, I won't mention Juilliard.
Can we do that?
I guess.
Ugh!
I'm sorry, I have to go back in.
I love you.
I get that.
I do.
I apologize, Madam Secretary.
It was my son.
He was worried.
Oh.
Understandable.
Is he okay?
Yeah.
Where are we with President Shwe?
It's over.
We're going home without a trade agreement.
Called the president;
I'm not sure the hearing in that ear will ever recover.
He's got a lot of nerve holding you accountable.
He's the one who put an unstable person in that post.
You got to see your son.
It wasn't a total waste.
Yeah, we'll see.
The truth is, ma'am, um... we've been estranged for a while.
But I wanted to mend fences, so I had to suck it up.
I kept my eye on the bigger picture.
And you know what?
He met me halfway.
At least in theory.
That's good.
You found the Middle Way.
That's a Buddhist principle I was lectured on by a guy holding a gun to someone's head.
It's one thing to talk about, quite another to put into practice.
Yeah, it is.
I'll start making arrangements to go home.
Uh, first, Nadine, see if you can get the Chinese foreign minister on the phone.
Yes, ma'am.
Thank you, guys.
Anybody home?
Just me.
Well, that'll do.
Are you okay, babe?
Yeah.
- Ouch.
- Oh.
I'm a little tired.
I'm sure you are.
I saw the news.
You put that trade agreement back together.
What happened?
I had an epiphany.
I found the Middle Way.
Oh, my God.
You're a Buddhist.
More like a... suck-it-upist.
Since when?
Well, after President Shwe changed his mind about the agreement, I managed to work a side deal with the Chinese to protect
Myanmar's water rights.
So, by prostrating myself and taking all the blame, which I did not deserve,
everybody signed and there you go.
Wow.
History made.
That's great.
Congratulations.
Mm.
Thank you.
I couldn't pull things off with the neighbors.
Well, there's... still time.
What, you want to employ the "suck it up" strategy with them?
While it's working, yes.
I may have incinerated the Middle Way.
Well, there's only one way to find out.
What in the world are...?
How do these things get so out of order?
It's the alphabet, people.
You're still upset about the 2030 report?
Rising sea levels, displaced people, economic upheaval?
Yeah, it's staying with me.
If you want to bury yourself in work, the secretary has a real assignment for us.
Yes, please.
We need to get to the bottom of why the SUVs are left running outside her house.
There has to be a way to stop that.
I tried.
Oh.
After the evil brunch, I did some research.
It would take mountains of paperwork, questions from Congress and at least six months of waiting.
Most likely to be turned down.
Huh.
Well... in that case, there's only one thing left to do.

You know, when I was a little girl, we didn't have fire drills.
We had nuclear bomb drills.
Duck and cover.
Duck under the desk and cover your head.
As if that would've helped.
We were all absolutely convinced that one day we would all die in a nuclear war.
Oh.
We just lived with it.
Oh, we... tried to get the most out of our time, but we just hoped and prayed for the best.
I studied the Cold War.
It's a miracle it didn't happen.
Oh, partly.
There were other things.
The SALT talks.
Ongoing negotiations among world leaders.
The Berlin Wall eventually came down, seemingly out of nowhere, but really... it had to do with a lot of people making good moves at the right time.
And yet here we are again, making a big mess of everything, and if we don't change our ways, then yes, it will be the stuff of nightmares.
But if we turned things around once,
I believe we can do it again.
Sometimes... you have to have faith in people.
Do not ever tell anyone I said that.
Yes, ma'am.
Meanwhile, that's why God created alcohol and music.
Now, get up there and sing.

Hi.
Can I help you, Madam Secretary, Dr. McCord?
Yeah.
Matt, I was wondering if maybe you guys could shut off the motors for the night?
No, ma'am.
It's protocol.
I'm not kidding.
This is important.
I'll tell you what, if you get in trouble,
- you just blame it on me, okay?
- I'm sorry, ma'am.
I'm not authorized to do that.
Hey, have you called Conrad to tell him the trade agreement is finalized?
Yeah, he was in a meeting, so I left a message at the office.
Uh, he's probably home by now.
It's this whole thing with the neighbors, Matt.
They-they don't like the cars running all the time.
The poor guy's kid has asthma.
Well, be that as it may, Dr. McCord,
I don't work for your neighbors.
That's true.
Technically, I don't even work for Secretary McCord.
That's true, too, technically.
Just hold on one second.
Um, Matt, the president would like a word.
Yes, Mr. President?
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
I understand.
Right-right away, sir.
Good-bye.
Thanks, Matt.
I'll tell the other guys.
Have a good night.
Oh.
I like the Middle Way.
That was not the Middle Way.
That was winning.
Well, I like that, too.
Previously on "Pretty Little Liars..."
(Spencer) We found a hole in Sara's closet in her room at The Radley.
The night Charlotte came home, the night she was murdered someone used a landline from The Two Crows to call this house.
(Ella) I'm so glad we finally told you.
Now we don't have to sneak around anymore.
Congratulations.
I buried someone who made my life hell for years.
I'm now being questioned in her murder.
I lost my job.
- Come back to New York with me.
- I can't.
Damian, I came to ask you if your article is fully about millennials and politics or if you have another angle.
The murder weapon was a golf club.
What Detective Tanner described was a hollow piece of metal cut with a rectangle at the end.
(Caleb)I've been working with the data from Yvonne's cell phone.
These are my mom's medical records.
How do they have these?
You and I need to talk about Ezra Fitz.
Does he know what you're doing?
You wrote this, big parts of it.
Melissa's suitcase is broken and there's a part missing that's metal, hollow and cut with a rectangle in the end.
Whoa.
Did she check out or get hurled out?
This is what the inside of Sara Harvey's head must look like.
I would have made her lick the carpet before she left.
Okay, let's show Ali the closet.
Urgh!
Who leaves coleslaw in the middle of the floor?
Hanna, closet.
(Alison) 'When you asked the front desk' 'did they know why she left so fast?
'
(Hanna) 'What do you think?
'
She's not racing off to a Messies Anonymous meeting.
- She knows we're on to her.
- It's gone.
- There's no hole.
- What?
That's impossible.
There's not even a seam where the hole used to be.
Guys, maybe this wasn't her room.
Don't.
Stop cutting Sara any slack.
Hey, I don't care how much she claimed to have loved
Charlotte like a sister.
This girl has two faces.
[door opens] [gasps]
- We should leave.
- No.
Look, guys, if my mom finds out that I used that key card......
We don't have to introduce ourselves.
We just have to walk out the door.
Emily, stop.
I'm not leaving until we can go back down there.
Okay, she doesn't even believe it exists!
I didn't say that, I'm just trying to understand why she would stalk you.
(Emily) 'Because she thinks we had something' 'to do with Charlotte's murder.'
- She thinks we know who did it!
- Shh!
Alright, let's move.
♪ Got a secret can you keep it swear this one you'll save ♪
♪ Better lock it in your pocket taking this one to the grave ♪
♪ If I show you then I know you won't tell what I said ♪
♪ 'Cause two can keep a secret if one of them is dead ♪
- Are you giving up?
- Nope, it's done.
- Seriously?
- The file was corrupted.
If they wanna leak your mom's medical report they're gonna have to break into her doctor's office again.
And you're sure that nobody in the Phillips camp could ever trace this back to you?
No way, I mean, they might find an exit node but they'll never figure out where it originated.
The anonymizer software disseminates traffic through multiple sources and....
Did I just put you to sleep?
No, no, I'm not.
I, I just....
I don't really think that this is just gonna go away.
You know, my mom could still be ambushed right before the election.
You're right, but if you tell her that then she's gonna wanna know how you learned about her being sick, and you open that box....
She's got enough to worry about.
Hey, let's make you some breakfast.
You need protein.
Fingernails can only supply so much.
When did you see me chew my fingernails?
In your sleep.
You went after mine first.
- No.
- Yes.
Hey.
Emily, hey, come in.
- Sorry to interrupt.
- No, you're not.
- Uh, you hungry?
- I can't stay.
I've got to get to the bursar's office at Hollis.
What's wrong?
Can you go back down with me?
We'll find another way to get down there.
- Emily, stop.
- I know.
But if Sara Harvey is hiding under the hotel what is she planning next?
Don't do this to yourself, okay?
She may have had nothing to do with the fertility clinic.
She's just playing on your fear.
Yeah, well, it's workin'.
Okay, it's not like someone stole my chapstick.
This person may be storing my future offspring in a Styrofoam cooler.
And if the police don't come up with a suspect soon then Sara's gonna think we're withholding information.
Okay, but we're not withholding anything.
Wh-what was that look?
You guys know something.
- Oh, what?
- No, we know nothing.
- Melissa's suitcase is broken.
- What?
The pull-up handle is missing a rod.
It could've been used as a weapon to crack someone's neck.
Okay, can we please not go there?
Melissa wasn't even in town the night that Charlotte was murdered.
Are you sure about that?
Emily, my mother's election is two weeks away.
I get it, but if Melissa had......
What?
Never wanted to watch Charlotte walk the streets again?
I mean, that pretty much covers everyone who loves us.
Should we add your mom to that suspect list too?
(Aria) I don't know how to handle this.
- You have to tell him.
- How?
Liam, he spent the last week pounding out chapters.
But if he ships them to Boston before you speak to him......
He won't.
He wants to speak to me first.
He wants feedback.
Did you sleep at all last night?
I'll sleep when I'm unemployed.
- Okay.
- Jillian's gonna fire me.
Or give you a book contract.
She loved what you wrote.
Because she thought that Ezra wrote it.
Okay, one step at a time.
First, tell the author.
Hopefully, he'll be...... flattered.
- Flattered?
- Then he'll call our boss.
Tell her he's had an epiphany and he wants to take the story in another direction.
I think the word is betrayed.
Aria, two weeks ago, this dude was pouring rum on his corn flakes.
He's lucky that someone who once sat in the back of his classroom actually cares enough to save his reputation.
It's-it's not that simple.
[sighs] I'm gonna tell him this afternoon.
This hasn't even hit the stores yet.
I called in a favor.
It's lovely.
Silk?
Yeah, and if you want, you can pair it with that beaded bolero unless you think that's too mother-of-the-bride.
This mother is a bride.
Did you bring all of these back from New York?
'Yeah, I tried to grab everything' without running into my former boss.
[cell phone rings]
- You can get that.
- Oh, no.
- It's Jordan.
He'll call back.
- No, please, answer it.
I mean, I feel guilty that I'm making you do all this when you have your own wedding......
No, this is work.
And you're doing this now.
We haven't even set a date yet.
So, umm, do you wanna try something on or did I totally strike out?
No, no, not at all.
You did a fabulous job.
It's just when Byron and I first got married umm, we were very determined not be traditional.
So we rented a barn and we basically dressed up like cowhands.
[chuckles] Well, that's cute.
- I mean, I love theme weddings.
- It wasn't a theme.
It was just two cynical college kids with no money and a skewed sense of what was romantic.
We made my mom sit on a keg.
Ugh!
What did she wear?
This time, I wanna feel like more of a bride and I wanna feel elegant.
- I can do elegant.
- I know you can.
Can you show me what you've picked out for yourself or is that a state secret?
Uh, no, I mean, I-I haven't even thought about what I'm gonna wear.
Seriously?
And your mom already sent out shower invitations and you haven't......
You know what?
Give me till the end of the day.
I know the dress.
So sorry to bother.
Can I borrow a pen?
What?
Oh, sure.
Thanks.
Can I also borrow $1000?
[chuckles] I'm lucky if I have enough left to buy a single textbook.
[chuckles]
Hold it.
You taking Intro To Psych?
- Yeah.
- Me too.
You know, the professor's supposed to be a real trip.
He's actually giving a lecture tonight.
I was thinking about going and asking a few questions just so I can start off on his good side.
You wanna join?
I-I'll run my questions past you so I don't sound like the village idiot.
You free?
Umm, yeah.
Cool.
I'm Damian.
Emily.
Hey, when did you get back?
- Just now.
- How did it go?
Fine, I guess.
I need a long hot shower.
Whose suitcase is that?
Mine.
What happened to your other one?
It was broken.
I tossed it.
- Good morning.
- It was until I opened my eyes.
Do you have time for a coffee?
Oh, honey, I've already had a pot.
Oh, jeez, Gil, not the Shriners.
We're supposed to be hitting up new voters not resuscitating the dead.
What's going on?
You look like a kid who just dropped her sucker in the sand.
- Honey, what is it?
- You should have told us.
Told you what?
That the cancer came back.
You kept it from us once when you promised us that that would never happen again.
The prognosis was good, so there was no reason......
There's every reason, mom.
I am not one of your constituents.
I'm gonna be fine, Spencer.
How did you find out about this?
That doesn't even matter, but if I know you can bet that your opponent's camp knows as well.
What do they know?
The doctors gave me a clean bill of health.
They supported my bid for office.
How about letting me support you?
Look, I was planning on telling you and Melissa after the election.
But Gil, he, he begged me not to share this.
It would, it would scare off the voters, hijack the platform.
It would be all that anyone would ever ask me about.
So what if they did?
Mom, I work on Capitol Hill.
I know all of the traps.
But you're running on a platform based on transparency and integrity.
Do not set yourself up to be blindsided once you get into the office.
You know, you were the one who taught me that courage is all about having grace under fire.
I mean, it doesn't really get harder than this.
You're right.
Thank you for reminding me why I did this.
Mom, you're gonna make a great senator.
No.
I meant why I had kids.
You get the chance to make people better than yourself.
I love you.
[cell phone beeps]
__
__
Do you wanna send that back, order something else?
Hmm?
Oh, no, no.
It's tasty.
Listen, uh, okay, so your mother and I have this crazy idea.
Uh, we were thinking how great it would be if we were actually married by someone who really knew us.
Like you.
What?
Dad, I can't officiate your wedding.
I'm not a minister.
Well, no, wait, that's the easy part.
You can just get a license online.
I mean, we would still have to be recognized by the state for the ceremony......
Dad, seriously, you don't want me to do that.
Why not?
You are the writer in this family.
[clears throat]
Okay, listen, there's no pressure, okay?
It was just this crazy idea that your mom and I have.
It's not that I don't want to.
I just, I don't want Mike to feel left out or anything.
Oh...... don't worry about Mike.
Your brother's not coming.
Why?
Why, I thought he said he was gonna try to......
I just think he's not, not so happy about this.
That is insane.
Why wouldn't he want you and mom to be back together?
Possibly because he has never forgiven me for why we broke up.
He doesn't trust that I won't hurt her again.
Well, it's his loss because it's gonna be a very special day.
I'll work on the ceremony tonight.
She got her first text.
Wait, so now this freak thinks that Alison's hiding something about the murder too?
That doesn't even make sense.
Well, if it is Sara Harvey, she's probably furious that Alison's talking to us again.
Why is Melissa just sitting there in her car?
Okay.
- Hey.
- Hi.
Turns out my trip was a huge success.
Polls show a 12% gain.
I'm more persuasive than I thought.
Hail to the conqueror.
Hey, do you, umm, have that luggage tag on your old suitcase?
Gil said you really need to submit it if you want......
Forget about it.
The trip's already paid for.
Put the funds toward mom's victory party.
Hey, umm, how did you break your suitcase?
- What?
- I told him about it.
'Cause he just really likes to fix things.
What makes you assume I broke it?
Well, when did you notice it was broken?
When I pulled it out of the cab from the Philly airport.
The idiot took every bumpy, potholed street to avoid baseball traffic.
- Have a nice walk.
- Bye.
I know what you're gonna say.
Well, then I won't say it.
Say it.
Your sister got back into town two Saturdays ago.
- Right?
- Mmm.
The Phillies had an away game that day so that traffic would've been in Baltimore.
Please don't be silent.
Just talk this through with me.
Aria, it's done.
You've already submitted six chapters.
Did Jillian like it?
Was she pleased?
Kinda, yeah.
On a scale of one to ten ten being very pleased, over the moon......
Ezra......
- I need a number.
Nine, eight and a half, I....
Eight and a quarter.
She had notes.
Did she?
And was I receptive?
Ezra, I will go to my boss on Monday and I will tell her the truth.
Aria, you can't do that.
She'll kick you to the curb.
How could she even trust you again?
It's what it is.
No, it isn't.
I know you were trying to protect me.
You saw that I was falling apart and you assumed the worst.
You thought the jury would hand down a lighter sentence if I wrote a painful and gripping story which also has all the makings of a great romantic novel if you wanna write that too.
I can't really tell if you wanna hug me or punch me.
How can I punch you?
This wasn't a career move.
This-this...... was an act of love.
Oh, we-we could just turn in all of it.
I mean, Dickens was paid by the inch.
Oh.
Can I just read what you wrote?
It's probably a lot better than what I have.
(Hanna) Okay, tell me you're not in love.
It's gorgeous.
And I got a simple veil to go with it.
Nothing too insane, but just a little something to add mystery.
The mystery is how am I going to walk in it.
I may need to borrow Emily's legs.
Well, I'll hem it.
You're gonna rock this dress, I promise.
Please try it on.
Oh, wait.
- What about the veil?
- No, that's okay.
I don't want anything to detract from the dress.
You did good.
Your work here is done.
What about the tables?
You want them to complement the dress, right?
Can I please do the tables?
Knock yourself out.
- Hey.
- Hi.
Go back outside.
I don't want you to see the bride.
- It's bad luck.
- I'm not the groom, Hanna.
I'm the minister or officiator, whatever.
Well, I'm styling it, so I guess we'll both be working the party.
Wait, you're gonna be there?
That's weird.
- Why is it weird?
- Because I....
I didn't invite any friends.
I was trying to be sensitive.
Sensitive to what?
Making you sit at a small wedding with Caleb and Spencer two feet from the ceremony.
Would you be comfortable with that?
I have no issue with Spencer and Caleb, alright?
They're great together and we're all different people now.
I'm happy for them.
This is happy.
Ali, what is it?
The night that Charlotte came home....
We stayed up late talking.
And I told her about us.
She stared at me like a cat.
And then she went upstairs.
I could tell that she felt betrayed.
Probably more by me than you.
I was her doctor.
No, I think she was angry at me.
That's why she ran out in the middle of the night.
It may not have been because of a phone call.
I might have delivered my sister....
To whoever did that to her.
Alison, th-that's not true.
The person who failed Charlotte in that moment....
Was me....
Not you.
Hey, how did it go?
Excellent.
I'm now gainfully employed.
Well, at least until tomorrow night.
I'm starved.
Do you wanna order in?
Oh, I'm going to a lecture with a guy from my psych class.
Trying to earn brownie points with the new professor.
Well, congratulations.
At least one of us will have a degree that matters.
I enrolled, Hanna, but it's not like it was four years ago when the only thing I had to worry about in freshman year was catching something from a communal shower curtain.
Emily, you're not gonna have......
Yes, I am, Hanna.
How am I supposed to take notes when the voice in my head is telling me that Sara Harvey is torturing you for something Melissa might have done?
Wait, Melissa Hastings?
Melissa might have called Charlotte from the diner, she could've been the one who lured her out in the middle of the night......
No, no, no, hold on.
Wasn't Melissa in London?
Spencer thinks so.
Caleb doesn't.
[cell phone rings]
Oh, who's Damian?
Uh, he goes to Hollis.
That's who I'm meeting up with.
- Hey, there.
- 'Hey.'
It's a good thing I got here early.
It's insane.
That line behind me is waiting to get in.
- Can you save me a seat?
- 'Sure.'
Yeah, I just wanted to make sure you're still coming.
- I'll see you soon.
- Bye.
He looks familiar.
Did you ever buy any used books from Hollis?
No, but they did actually deliver a box for you this afternoon.
Really?
I haven't ordered any.
Em, what's wrong?
"What To Name The Baby?" What class is that?
Oh, my God.
What does it say?
I've chosen to share this with you because ultimately, my diagnosis was a wake-up call.
'And I trust now that you have this insight' you'll know that I don't give up without a fight.
[sighs]
- Hanna, hey.
- Hey.
Hey, uh, did you get my messages?
No, I'm-I'm so sorry.
I just turned my phone off, so that I could watch.
Are you okay?
I think Melissa could have done it.
I saw your sister years ago in London.
Okay, where are you?
You will never guess who just talked to me.
Okay, so I was in line at the bar and some stranger just compliments my shoes and I turn around, it's Claudia Freakin' Greco, Caleb.
And don't pretend like you don't know who she is.
I have to go.
Melissa?
Hello, Hanna.
- What are you doing here?
- I live here.
Well, not in this bathroom, but nearby.
No, this event.
Fashion Week.
Did you change careers?
I came with a friend who ditched me because I've spent the entire night sobbing into my phone.
Is that drink yours or mine?
Uh, yours.
How's Wren?
He's gone.
He left me.
That scheming nut job who made your life a living hell has now moved on to mess with mine.
You mean Charlotte?
Who the hell gave that twisted sister phone privileges?
I mean, how does someone with her resume get put under penthouse arrest?
I try not to think about her.
You know, forgive and forget.
Yeah, a leopard doesn't change its spots.
Wait, did she call you?
No, she called Wren and clearly, she shared information with him because he's been looking at me for the last week like I should be the one locked up.
And is that because of Bethany Young?
If she's willing to tell him, who else is she gonna tell?
You know, we all have a past, Hanna.
Aren't you curious what she plans to use against you?
Here.
Why don't we call her and find out?
Melissa, stop.
Someone needs to shut her up for good.
Melissa, give me my phone!
I'm doing you a favor.
You'll thank me one day.
Hi, this is Alison DiLaurentis.
Can I please speak to my sister, Charlotte?
- Give me the phone.
- Well, wake her up.
She has her whole life to nap.
Tell her Hanna wants to say hi.
Melissa, stop.
No, I don't wanna speak to her doctor.
I wanna speak to my bloody sister!
Put Charlotte on!
I don't wanna hear her voice!
[glass shatters]
Well, you have a funny way of forgiving, Hanna.
Why didn't you tell me about this when you came home from that trip?
She didn't want another person telling her that she wasn't over it.
Well, neither was your sister.
So can you at least find out if Melissa called that night from the diner?
Thanks.
Oh, umm, what was the name of that sneaky blogger dude from Hollis?
The one who freaked out you and Melissa?
So what made you decide to come back?
Here...... where you grew up.
What was the, what was the draw?
Oh, uh, my mom was alone so I thought it'd be good to be nearby.
Right.
Hey, do you wanna grab a cup of coffee in here and take it across the street?
- Sure.
That sounds great.
- Yeah.
Great.
[cell phone beeps]
How do you take it?
Your coffee?
You know what?
Let's skip the coffee.
Let's grab dinner instead.
Even better.
Ezra Fitz?
Hi, I'm Liam Greene.
Uh, we met once before.
I work with Aria at the publishing house.
That's right.
Yeah.
Umm, what brings you to Rosewood?
Aria invited me to her parents' wedding.
Oh, that's great.
That should be a lot of fun.
In a parents' wedding sort of way.
Yeah.
I'm actually meeting Aria here.
Umm, she suggested that, uh, we go over the chapters I gave her.
Oh, well, I'm anxious to read them myself.
From what I hear, it's a great plot.
Nice twists.
Strong characters.
Yeah.
Umm, I just wanna put it out there.
Uh, the protagonist was inspired by this woman that I traveled the world with.
Uh, it's not Aria.
Umm, I mean, we never ventured out past Philly.
And though some can find romance in the Liberty Bell umm, I just wanted to say this so there's no confusion.
If you thought I was writing about Aria and me, I'm not.
- Hey.
- Oh, look who it is.
Uh, sorry, I'm late, I was working on the ceremony and I must have lost track of time.
Umm, so how long have you two been sitting here?
Umm, not long, but I'll leave you two alone.
I'm sure Mr. Fitz is eager to get his feedback.
Liam.
Liam, wait.
Does Ezra know that you know?
- Know what?
- About me ghostwriting.
No, but at least now I know that Mr. Fitz was more than just your favorite teacher.
Is this why you wanted to stay in Rosewood?
Liam.
Please pick up, pick up.
[automated message] 'Please leave a message.' [sighs] Hey, Liam, it's me again.
Look, I'm so sorry, okay?
Just....
I-I need a chance to explain.
Call me.
Oh, but not after 5:00.
I'll...... be marrying my parents.
Bye.
- 'Have you eaten today?
'
- I can't remember.
- What day is it?
- It's your wedding day.
You can't be nervous.
You've married Byron before.
'True, it makes no logical sense' but when he walks in the room, it's like I'm 19 again.
God, help me.
Well, I think it's fate.
People who are meant to be together take a break and then find their way back to their first love.
What's more romantic than that?
Oh, Byron wasn't my first love.
His name was Ricky Eichler.
He played the drums and had green eyes that you could drown in and he was sexy and badass and I thought we would be together forever.
- What happened to him?
- Who knows?
We graduated and we grew up.
[cell phone rings]
I'll call him back.
Is that message for me?
How long are you gonna avoid me?
I'm not avoiding you.
I'm trying......
Alison, I will give you as much space as you need.
I just don't wanna be pushed away because you feel unnecessary guilt.
I'm......
I'm feeling a lot of things.
Is there any way you can look at me and not see your sister?
I'm here, Alison.
I'm alive.
And I love you.
And I wanna spend the rest of my life with you.
What are you saying?
Exactly what you think I said.
(Veronica) 'I mean, Gil said that....'
Hey, I wanted to say congratulations but by the time we got home, you were already asleep.
Oh, it was an exhausting day.
What's wrong?
Apparently, while I was recording the speech a story came out intended to crush my opponent.
Well, that's politics.
Some days you're the pigeon, some days you're the statue.
Don't be glib.
This could destroy all the goodwill mom just earned.
How?
Why would anything about Christine Phillips affect mom's speech?
It's not about Christine.
- It's about her daughter.
- Yvonne?
Why?
What did she do?
She got rid of an unwanted pregnancy in high school.
(Veronica) 'And someone was able to dredge up a medical report' which is more than just a little embarrassing when you're running on a pro-life platform.
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah, it gets worse.
The Phillips camp believes the leak came out of our office.
There's a full-on investigation underway.
Any idea who would have put that out there?
(Emily) 'I had a drink with Damian and all I could get out of him' was that Melissa was definitely back before Charlotte was released.
She could have made that call from the diner.
Okay, this place is either really unpopular or really closed.
Hanna, call me back.
The reception out here sucks, but keep trying.
Oh, and send me some wedding pictures.
[dramatic music] [doorknob rattles]
[engine revving] [gasps]
[engine revving]
[banging]
Hello, is anybody there?
Hello?
[intense music]
(Aria) Who are we when we're alone?
And who are we when we're with this other person?
Are we really ready to be with another person 'before we truly know ourselves?
'
My parents have answered these questions.
They know exactly who they are and what they want.
As individuals, each of them is loving, wise and sensitive.
Together, they're more.
They're inspiring.
So here they are together again making a new commitment to be there for the best week ever and the worst week ever which sometimes happens in the same week.
Byron, Ella do you promise to love, comfort and honor each other for the rest of your lives?
(both) We do.
Then I now pronounce you husband and wife.
Dad, you may kiss mom.
But remember, you're doing it in front of your daughter.
[cheering and applauding]
[cell phone beeps]
[cell phone beeps] [engine revving]
[grunts] [intense music]
(Caleb) It can't be Mona.
- You don't know that.
- I do.
I made it clear, if she messes with this family she's gonna be back underground breathing through a straw.
Okay, so what?
You think Sara Harvey did this?
[door opens]
Forgive the intrusion, but I just got off the phone with Gil.
- What did he say?
- Maybe you should come inside.
I am inside.
What did he say?
Christine Phillips hired an expert who tracked the source of the leak.
What is going on?
It was traced back to your IP address, Spencer.
What?
That doesn't make any sense.
I haven't touched this laptop all day.
I was with Caleb watching your speech on his computer at The Brew......
Spencer, please, don't lie to me.
You must have hacked into their system.
That's how you knew about my diagnosis.
No, mom, that's not how I knew......
No, she didn't do it.
I did it.
I leaked it.
Is that true?
Caleb, why are you saying this?
Do you understand what this means?
They were prepared to do the same to you.
I....
Sometimes you need to make a preemptive strike.
That wasn't your call to make.
Mom, he didn't do this.
Well, you'll need to resign from this campaign immediately.
And it would also be wise to gather your things and leave here...... tonight.
[engine revving]
[engine revving]
[gasps] [panting]
So where are they going for their honeymoon?
Atlantic City.
My mom had a Groupon.
I'm joking.
It's some dumpy, little motel on the Jersey Shore where they spent a wild college weekend.
Sweet.
Thanks for coming.
I'm glad I did.
It was helpful to hear what your thoughts are on true love and...... commitment.
I am...... so sorry.
I wasn't completely honest about my....
History with Ezra.
Okay.
Why did you hold back?
I guess I still wasn't being completely honest with myself.
It's been....
It's been confusing.
It was pretty clear on the page.
If he's the one you were writing about......
I wasn't or....
Maybe I was.
I don't know.
Writing those words....
Maybe it...... gave me the chance to work it out.
And have you?
I think so.
How does it end?
I didn't know until right now.

Hey, Jordan, sorry, I haven't called you back.
I've been in full wedding mode.
Well, somebody else's.
But for ours, I think I picked a date.
How does May 17 sound to you?
Okay, well, umm, call me back.
Oh, and I love you.
♪ Here we go again is it your choice or mine ♪
♪ Here we go ♪
♪ Oh never mind I'll be fine ♪
No.
No, you're not leaving.
Please, just go in there and tell my mother the truth.
Spencer, she's two weeks out.
This is the truth she needs to win.
If there needs to be a scapegoat, let it be me.
- Not you.
- Caleb......
Hey, I will figure out who did this.
You need to find out what Melissa's been up to.
I can cover for one sister at a time.
Where are you gonna go?
I don't know.
I'll-I'll work it out.
I want you to stay.
I know you do....
But I can't.
What happened?
What is that?
What's left of my phone.
Emily, where were you?
Did you go back to the tunnel?
Did your car break down?
I couldn't even make it to my car.
And when I did, I was shaking so much, I could barely drive.
Emily, were you attacked?
Did Sara Harvey come after you?
- I was, but it wasn't her.
- Well, then who?
I don't know.
Sara Harvey wants this murder solved.
Whoever this was, they wanna cover it up.
How do you know that?
Because they may have found the weapon.
What?
They were willing to kill me to get it back.
So what are you saying?
There's now more than one person after us?
There's definitely two.
[pounding on door]
Whoa!
Who is that?
[pounding continues]
Sure someone paid the caterer?
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- I told you it was too late.
- She was sleeping.
- They weren't sleeping.
- 'Oh, hi.'
- Hi.
Party's kinda over, guys.
Umm, were you guys looking......
Get married...... tonight.
Alison tells me you're now licensed.
Wait, you wanna get married?
You want me to marry you?
To each other?
Right now?
Is English her first language?
Oh, I cannot do that.
Why not?
Your twinkle lights are still on in your backyard.
And I have rings.
Please, Aria, marry us.
[dramatic music]
HANNA:
Previously on Pretty Little Liars...
SPENCER:
We found a hole in Sara's closet in her room at the Radley.
The night Charlotte came home, the night she was murdered, someone used the landline from The Two Crows to call this house.
I am so glad we finally told you.
Now, we don't have to sneak around anymore.
Congratulations.
I buried someone who made my life hell for years.
I'm now being questioned in her murder, I lost my job--
- Come back to New York with me.
- I can't.
Damian, I came to ask you if your article was really about millennials and politics, or if you have another angle.
The murder weapon was a golf club.
What Detective Tanner described was a hollow piece of metal cut with a rectangle at the end.
CALEB:
I've been working with the data from Yvonne's cell phone.
These are my mom's medical records.
How did they have these?
You and I need to talk about Ezra Fitz.
Does he know what you're doing?
You wrote this.
Big parts of it.
Melissa's suitcase is broken.
And there's a part missing that's metal, hollow and cut with a rectangle on the end.
(DOOR OPENS)
Whoa.
Did she check out or get hurled out?
This is what the inside of Sara Harvey's head must look like.
(SIGHS) I would've made her lick the carpet before she left.
Okay, let's show Ali the closet.
Ugh, who leaves coleslaw in the middle of the floor?
Hanna, closet.
ALISON:
When you asked the front desk, did they know why she left so fast?
HANNA:
What do you think?
She's not racing off to a Messies Anonymous meeting.
She knows we're on to her.
It's gone!
There's no hole!
What?
That's impossible.
EMILY:
There's not even a seam where the hole used to be.
Guys, maybe this wasn't her room.
Don't!
Stop cutting Sara any slack, okay?
I don't care how much she claimed to have loved Charlotte like a sister, this girl has two faces!
-(DOOR OPENS) -(GASPS)
- We should leave.
- No.
Guys, if my mom finds out that I used that keycard--
We don't have to introduce ourselves.
We just have to walk out the door.
(WHISPERS) Please, stop.
I'm not leaving until we can go back down there, okay?
She doesn't even believe it exists!
I didn't say that.
I'm just trying to understand why she would stalk you.
EMILY:
Because she thinks we had something to do with Charlotte's murder!
- She thinks we know who did it.
-(SHUSHING)
All right.
Let's move.
♪ (THEME SONG) ♪
Are you giving up?
Nope.
It's done.
- Seriously?
- File's corrupted.
If they want to leak your mom's medical report, they're gonna have to break into her doctor's office.
Again.
And you're sure that nobody in the Phillips camp could ever trace this back to you?
No way.
I mean, they might find an exit node, but they'll never figure out where it originated.
The anonymizer software disseminates traffic through multiple sources and...
Did I just put you to sleep?
- No, no.
I'm not.
Just...
-(LAUGHS)
I don't really think that this is just gonna go away.
You know, my mom could still be ambushed right before the election.
You're right.
But if you tell her that, then she's gonna want to know how you learned about her being sick.
- And you open that box--
- She's got enough to worry about.
Hey, let's make you some breakfast, you need protein.
Fingernails can only supply so much.
- When did you see me chew my fingernails?
- In your sleep.
You went after mine first.
- No.
- Yes.
(BOTH LAUGH)
Hey.
Emily, hey.
Come in.
Sorry to interrupt.
No, you're not.
Uh, you hungry?
I can't stay.
I've got to get to the bursar's office at Hollis.
What's wrong?
Can you go back down with me?
We'll find another way to get down there.
Emily, stop--
I know, but if Sara Harvey is hiding under the hotel, and what is she planning next?
Don't do this to yourself, okay?
She may have had nothing to do with the fertility clinic.
She's just playing on your fear.
Yeah, well, it's working, okay?
It's not like someone stole my chapstick.
This person may be storing my future offspring in a Styrofoam cooler.
And if the police don't come up with a suspect soon, then Sara's gonna think we're withholding information.
Okay, but we're not withholding anything.
What was that look?
You guys know something.
- What?
- No.
We know nothing.
Um...
Melissa's suitcase is broken.
- What?
- The pull-up handle is missing a rod.
It could've been used as a weapon to crack someone's neck.
Okay, can we please not go there?
Melissa wasn't even in town the night that Charlotte was murdered.
Are you sure about that?
Emily, my mother's election is two weeks away--
I get it, but if Melissa--
What?
Never wanted to watch Charlotte walk the streets again?
I mean, that pretty much covers everyone who loves us.
Should we add your mom to that suspect list, too?
ARIA:
I don't know how to handle this.
- You have to tell him.
- How?
Liam, he spent the last week pounding out chapters.
But if he ships them to Boston before you speak to him--
He won't.
He wants to speak to me first.
He wants feedback.
Did you sleep at all last night?
-I'll sleep when I'm unemployed.
- Okay.
- Jillian's going to fire me.
- Or give you a book contract.
She loved what you wrote.
Because she thought that Ezra wrote it!
Okay, one step at a time.
First, tell the author.
- Hopefully, he'll be flattered.
-(SIGHS) Flattered?
Then he'll call our boss, tell her he's had an epiphany, and he wants to take the story in another direction.
I think the word is "betrayed."
Aria, two weeks ago, this dude was pouring rum on his Corn Flakes.
He's lucky that someone who once sat in the back of his classroom actually cares enough to save his reputation.
It's...
It's not that simple.
(SIGHS) I'm gonna tell him this afternoon.
This hasn't even hit the stores yet.
I called in a favor.
It's lovely.
Silk?
Yeah.
And if you want, you can pair it with that beaded bolero.
Unless you think that's too "mother of the bride."
This mother is a bride.
Did you bring all of these back from New York?
Yeah.
I tried to grab everything without running into my former boss.
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
You can get that.
Oh, no, it's Jordan.
He'll call back.
No, please, answer it.
I mean, I feel guilty that I'm making you do all this when you have your own wedding--
No, this is work, and you're doing this now.
We haven't even set a date yet.
So, um, do you wanna try something on, or did I totally strike out?
No, no.
Not at all.
You did a fabulous job.
It's just, when Byron and I first got married, um, we were very determined not to be traditional.
So we rented a barn, and we basically dressed up like cowhands.
(CHUCKLES) Well, that's cute.
I mean, I love theme weddings.
It wasn't a theme.
It was just two cynical college kids with no money and a skewed sense of what was romantic.
We made my mom sit on a keg.
Ugh, what did she wear?
This time, I want to feel like more of a bride, and I want to feel elegant.
- I can do elegant.
- I know you can.
Can you show me what you've picked out for yourself, or is that a state secret?
Uh, no.
I mean, I haven't even thought about what I'm gonna wear.
Seriously?
Your mom already sent out shower invitations, and you haven't--
You know what?
Give me till the end of the day.
I know the dress.
(SIGHS)
Sorry to bother you.
Can I borrow a pen?
- What?
Oh, sure.
- Thanks.
- Can I also borrow $1,000?
-(LAUGHS)
I'm lucky if I have enough left to buy a single textbook.
(CHUCKLES)
Hold it.
You're taking Intro to Psych?
- Yeah.
- Me, too.
You know, the professor's supposed to be a real trip.
He's actually giving a lecture tonight.
I was thinking about going and asking a few questions just so I can start off on his good side.
You wanna join?
I'll run my questions past you, so I don't sound like the village idiot.
You free?
Um...
Yeah.
- Cool.
I'm Damian.
- Emily.
- Hey.
When did you get back?
- Just now.
- How did it go?
- Fine.
I guess.
I need a long, hot shower.
Whose suitcase is that?
- Mine.
- What happened to your other one?
It was broken.
I tossed it.
Good morning.
It was.
Until I opened my eyes.
Do you have time for a coffee?
Oh, honey, I've already had a pot.
Oh, jeez, Gil, not the Shriners.
We're supposed to be hitting up new voters, not resuscitating the dead.
What's going on?
You look like a kid who just dropped her sucker in the sand.
- Honey, what is it?
- You should have told us.
Told you what?
That the cancer came back.
You kept it from us once, when you promised us that that would never happen again.
The prognosis was good.
So there was no reason to--
There's every reason, Mom.
lam not one of your constituents.
I'm gonna be fine, Spencer.
How did you find out about this?
That doesn't even matter.
But if I know, you can bet that your opponent's camp knows as well.
What do they know?
The doctors gave me a clean bill of health, they supported my bid for office--
How about letting me support you?
Look, I was planning on telling you and Melissa after the election.
But Gil...
He begged me not to share this.
It would scare off the voters, hijack the platform, it would be all that anyone would ever ask me about.
So what if they did?
Mom, I work on Capitol Hill.
I know all of the traps.
But you're running on a platform based on transparency and integrity.
Do not set yourself up to be blindsided once you get into the office.
You know, you were the one who taught me that courage is all about having grace under fire.
I mean, it doesn't really get hotter than this. (CHUCKLES)
(EXHALES)
You're right.
Thank you for reminding me why I did this.
Mom, you're gonna make a great senator.
No.
I meant why I had kids.
You get the chance to make people better than yourself.
I love you.
(SNIFFLES)
(CELL PHONE BEEPS)
Do you wanna send that back, order something else?
Hmm?
Oh, no.
It's tasty.
Listen.
Okay, so your mother and I have this crazy idea.
We were thinking how great it would be if we were actually married by someone who really knew us.
Like you.
What?
Dad, I can't officiate your wedding.
I'm not a minister.
No, wait.
That's the easy part.
You can just get a license online.
I mean, we would still have to be recognized by the state for the ceremony--
Dad, seriously?
You don't want me to do that.
Why not?
Look, you are the writer in this family.
(CLEARS THROAT)
Okay, listen.
There's no pressure, okay?
It was just a crazy idea that your mom and I had.
It's not that I don't want to.
I just...
I don't want Mike to feel left out or anything.
Well...
Don't worry about Mike.
Your brother's not coming.
Why?
I thought he said he was gonna try--
I just think he's not...
Not so happy about this.
That is insane.
Why wouldn't he want you and mom to be back together?
Possibly because he has never forgiven me for why we broke up.
He doesn't trust that I won't hurt her again.
Well, it's his loss, because it's gonna be a very special day.
I'll work on the ceremony tonight.
She got her first text.
Wait.
So, now this freak thinks that Alison's hiding something about the murder too?
That doesn't even make sense.
Well, if it is Sara Harvey, she's probably furious that Alison's talking to us again.
Why is Melissa just sitting there in her car?
MELISSA:
Okay.
- Hey.
- SPENCER:
Hi.
MELISSA:
Turns out my trip was a huge success.
Polls show a 12% gain.
I'm more persuasive than I thought.
Hail to the conqueror.
Hey, do you, um, have that luggage tag on your old suitcase?
Gil said you really need to submit it if you--
Forget about it.
The trip's already paid for.
Put the funds toward Mom's victory party.
- Hey, um, how did you break your suitcase?
- What?
I told him about it, 'cause he just really likes to fix things.
Well, what makes you assume I broke it?
Well, when did you notice it was broken?
When I pulled it out of the cab from the Philly airport.
That idiot took every bumpy, potholed street to avoid baseball traffic.
Have a nice walk.
Bye.
I know what you're gonna say.
CALEB:
Well, then I won't say it.
Say it.
Your sister got back into town two Saturdays ago, right?
The Phillies had an away game that day, so that traffic would've been in Baltimore.
ARIA:
Please don't be silent.
Just talk this through with me.
Aria, it's done.
You've already submitted six chapters.
Did Jillian like it?
Was she pleased?
Kind of.
Yeah.
On a scale of one to ten, ten being very pleased, over the moon--
- Ezra--
- I need a number.
Nine.
Eight and a half.
Eight and a quarter?
- She had notes.
- EZRA:
Did she?
And was I receptive?
Ezra, I will go to my boss on Monday, and I will tell her the truth.
Aria, you can't do that.
She'll kick you to the curb.
How could she even trust you again?
-It is what it is.
- No.
It isn't.
I know you were trying to protect me.
Saw that I was falling apart, and you assumed the worst.
You thought a jury would hand out a lighter sentence if I wrote a painful and gripping story, which also has all the makings of a great romantic novel, if you want to write that too.
I can't really tell if you wanna hug me or punch me.
EZRA:
How could I punch you?
This wasn't a career move.
This...
This was an act of love.
We could just turn in all of it.
I mean, Dickens was paid by the inch.
Uh...
Can I just read what you wrote?
It's probably a lot better than what I have.
HANNA:
Okay, tell me you're not in love.
ELLA:
It's gorgeous.
And I got a simple veil to go with it.
Nothing too insane, but just a little something to add mystery.
The mystery is how am I going to walk in it?
- I may need to borrow Emily's legs.
- Well, I'll hem it.
You're gonna rock this dress.
I promise.
Please try it on.
Oh, wait, what about the veil?
ELLA:
No, that's okay.
I don't want anything to detract from the dress.
You did good.
Your work here is done.
What about the tables?
You want them to complement the dress, right?
Can I please do the tables?
Knock yourself out.
- Hey.
- Hi.
Oh, go back outside.
I don't want you to see the bride.
It's bad luck.
I'm not the groom, Hanna.
I'm the minister.
Or officiator.
Whatever.
Well, I'm styling it.
So, I guess we'll both be working the party.
Wait, you're gonna be there?
That's weird.
- Why is it weird?
- Because I...
I didn't invite any friends.
I was trying to be sensitive.
Sensitive to what?
Making you sit at a small wedding with Caleb and Spencer.
Two feet from the ceremony.
Would you be comfortable with that?
I have no issue with Spencer and Caleb.
All right?
They're great together.
And we're all different people now.
I'm happy for them.
This is happy.
(SIGHS)
Ali, what is it?
The night that Charlotte came home, we stayed up late talking, and I told her about us.
She stared at me like a cat.
And then she went upstairs.
I could tell that she felt betrayed.
Probably more by me than you.
I was her doctor.
No.
I think she was angry at me.
That's why she ran out in the middle of the night.
It may not have been because of a phone call.
I might've delivered my sister to whoever did that to her.
Alison, that's not true.
The person who failed Charlotte in that moment was me.
Not you.
EMILY:
Hey, how'd it go?
Excellent.
I'm now gainfully employed.
Well, at least until tomorrow night.
I'm starved.
Do you wanna order in?
Well, I'm actually going to a lecture with a guy from my Psych class.
Trying to earn brownie points with a new professor.
Wow, congratulations.
At least one of us will have a degree that matters.
I enrolled, Hanna, but it's not like it was four years ago, when the only thing I had to worry about in freshman year was catching something from a communal shower curtain.
Emily, you're not gonna--
Yes, I am, Hanna.
How am I supposed to take notes when the voice in my head is telling me that
Sara Harvey's torturing you for something Melissa might have done?
Wait.
Melissa Hastings?
Melissa might've called Charlotte from the diner.
She could've been the one who lured her out in the middle of the night.
No, no, no.
Hold on.
Wasn't Melissa in London?
Spencer thinks so.
Caleb doesn't.
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
Who's Damian?
He goes to Hollis.
That's who I'm meeting up with.
Hey there.
Hey.
It's a good thing I got here early.
It's insane.
That line behind me is waiting to get in.
- Can you save me a seat?
- DAMIAN:
Sure.
Yeah.
I just wanted to make sure you were still coming.
- I'll see you soon.
- Bye.
He looks familiar.
Did you ever buy any used books from Hollis?
No.
But they did actually deliver a box for you this afternoon.
Really?
I haven't ordered any.
(INHALES)
Em, what's wrong?
"What To Name the Baby"?
What class is that?
Oh, my God.
What does it say?
I have chosen to share this with you because, ultimately, my diagnosis was a wake-up call.
And I trust now that you have this insight, you'll know that I don't give up without a fight.
(EXHALES)
- Hanna.
Hey.
- Hey.
Hey, uh, did you get my messages?
No, I'm so sorry.
I just turned my phone off so that I could watch...
Are you okay?
I think Melissa could have done it.
I saw your sister years ago in London.
Okay, where are you?
You will never guess who just talked to me.
Okay, so I was in line at the bar, and some stranger just compliments my shoes, and I turn around, and it's Claudia freakin' Grecco, Caleb.
And don't pretend like you don't know who she is.
I have to go.
Melissa?
Hello, Hanna.
What are you doing here?
I live here.
Not in this bathroom, but nearby.
No, this event.
Fashion Week.
Did you change careers?
I came with a friend.
Who ditched me because I've spent the entire night sobbing into my phone.
Is that drink yours or mine?
Uh, yours.
How's Wren?
He's gone.
He left me.
That scheming nutjob who made your life a living hell has now moved on to mess with mine.
You mean Charlotte?
Who the hell gave that twisted sister phone privileges?
I mean, how does someone with her resume get put under penthouse arrest?
I try not to think about her.
You know, forgive and forget.
Hmm, a leopard doesn't change its spots.
Wait, did she call you?
No.
She called Wren.
And clearly, she shared information with him because he's been looking at me for the last week like I should be the one locked up.
And is that because of Bethany Young?
If she's willing to tell him, who else is she gonna tell?
You know, we all have a past, Hanna.
Aren't you curious what she plans to use against you?
Here.
Why don't we call her and find out?
Melissa, stop.
Someone needs to shut her up for good.
Melissa, give me my phone!
I'm doing you a favor.
You'll thank me one day.
Hi, this is Alison DiLaurentis.
Can I speak to my sister, Charlotte?
- Give me the phone.
- Well, wake her up.
She has her whole life to nap.
Tell her Hanna wants to say hi.
Melissa, stop.
No, I don't want to speak to her doctor!
I wanna speak to my bloody sister!
Put Charlotte on!
I don't wanna hear her voice.
(GLASS SHATTERING)
Well, you have a funny way of forgiving, Hanna.
Why didn't you tell me about this when you came home from that trip?
She didn't want another person telling her that she wasn't over it.
Well, neither was your sister.
So, can you least find out if Melissa called that night from the diner?
Thanks.
Oh, um...
What was the name of that sneaky blogger dude from Hollis?
The one who freaked out you and Melissa?
So, what made you decide to come back?
Here.
Where you grew up.
- What was the...
What was the draw?
- Oh.
My mom was alone, so I thought it'd be good to be nearby.
Right.
Hey, do you wanna grab a cup of coffee in here and take it across the street?
- Sure.
Sounds great.
- Yeah?
Great.
(CELL PHONE BEEPS)
How do you take it?
Your coffee.
You know what?
Let's skip the coffee.
Let's grab dinner instead.
Even better.
Ezra Fitz?
Hi, I'm Liam Greene.
We met once before.
I work with Aria at the publishing house.
That's right.
Yeah.
Um, what brings you to Rosewood?
Aria invited me to her parents' wedding.
Oh, that's great.
That should be a lot of fun.
In a parents' wedding sort of way.
- Yeah.
-(BOTH LAUGH)
I'm actually meeting Aria here.
Um, she suggested that we go over the chapters I gave her.
Oh, I'm anxious to read them myself.
From what I hear, it's a great plot.
Nice twists.
Strong characters.
Yeah.
Um...
I just wanna put it out there.
The protagonist was inspired by this woman that I traveled the world with.
It's not Aria.
Um, I mean, we never ventured out past Philly.
And though some can find romance in the Liberty Bell, um,
I just want to say that so there's no confusion.
If you thought I was writing about Aria and me,
I'm not.
- Hey.
- Oh, look who it is.
Uh, sorry I'm late.
I was working on the ceremony, and I must've lost track of time.
- Mmm-hmm.
Um...
So how long have you two been sitting here?
Oh, not long, but I'll leave you two alone.
I'm sure Mr. Fitz is eager to get his feedback.
Liam.
Liam, wait.
Does Ezra know that you know?
- Know what?
- About me.
- Ghostwriting.
- No.
But at least now I know that Mr. Fitz was more than just your favorite teacher.
Is this why you wanted to stay in Rosewood?
(ELEVATOR BELL DINGS)
Liam?
Please pick up.
Pick up.
- LIAM: (ON PHONE) Please leave a message.
-(SIGHS)
Hey, Liam, it's me.
Again.
Look, I'm so sorry.
Okay?
Just...
I need a chance to explain.
Call me.
Oh, but not after 5:00.
I'll be marrying my parents.
Bye.
Wens)
HANNA:
Have you eaten today?
I can't remember.
What day is it?
It's your wedding day.
You can't be nervous.
You've married Byron before.
ELLA:
True.
It makes no logical sense.
But when he walks in the room, it's like I'm 19 again.
God help me.
Well, I think it's fate.
People who are meant to be together take a break and then find their way back to their first love.
What's more romantic than that?
Oh, Byron wasn't my first love.
His name was Ricky Eichler.
He played the drums and had green eyes that you could drown in.
And he was sexy and badass, and I thought we would be together forever.
What happened to him?
Who knows?
We graduated and we grew up.
(CELL PHONE RINGS)
I'll call him back.
Is that message for me?
(SIGHS)
How long are you gonna avoid me?
I'm not avoiding you.
-I'm trying--
- Alison...
I will give you as much space as you need.
I just don't wanna be pushed away because you feel unnecessary guilt.
I'm...
I'm feeling a lot of things.
Is there any way you can look at me and not see your sister?
I'm here, Alison.
I'm alive.
(SIGHS)
And I love you.
And I want to spend the rest of my life with you.
What are you saying?
Exactly what you think I said.
(CHUCKLES)
VERONICA:
I mean, Gil said that...
Hey.
I wanted to say congratulations, but by the time we got home, you were already asleep.
Oh, it was an exhausting day.
What's wrong?
Apparently, while I was recording the speech, a story came out intended to crush my opponent.
Well, that's politics.
Some days you're the pigeon, some days you're the statue.
Don't be glib.
This could destroy all the goodwill Mom just earned.
How?
Why would anything about Christine Phillips affect Mom's speech?
It's not about Christine.
It's about her daughter.
Yvonne?
Why, what did she do?
She got rid of an unwanted pregnancy in high school.
VERONICA:
And someone was able to dredge up a medical report, which is more than just a little embarrassing when you're running on a pro-life platform.
Oh, my God.
Yeah.
It gets worse.
The Phillips camp believes the leak came out of our office.
There's a full-on investigation underway.
Any idea who would've put that out there?
EMILY:
I had a drink with Damian, and all I could get out of him was that Melissa was definitely back before Charlotte was released.
She could've made a call from the diner.
Okay.
This place is either really unpopular or really closed.
Hanna, call me back.
The reception out here sucks, but keep trying.
Oh, and send me some wedding pictures.
(ENGINE STARTING)
Hello!
ls anybody in there?
Hello!
ARIA:
Who are we when we're alone?
And who are we when we're with this other person?
Are we really ready to be with another person before we truly know ourselves?
My parents have answered these questions.
They know exactly who they are and what they want.
As individuals, each of them is loving, wise and sensitive.
Together, they're more.
They're inspiring.
So, here they are, together again, making a new commitment to be there for the best week ever and the worst week ever.
Which sometimes happens in the same week.
Byron, Ella, do you promise to love, comfort, and honor each other for the rest of your lives?
- We do. (CHUCKLES)
- We do.
Then I now pronounce you husband and wife.
Dad, you may kiss Mom.
But remember, you're doing it in front of your daughter.

CALEB:
It can't be Mona.
- You don't know that.
- I do.
I made it clear.
If she messes with this family, she's gonna be back underground, breathing through a straw.
Okay.
So what, you think Sara Harvey did this?
(DOOR OPENS)
Forgive the intrusion, but I just got off the phone with Gil.
What did he say?
Maybe you should come inside.
I am inside.
What did he say?
Christine Phillips hired an expert who tracked down the source of the leak.
What is going on?
It was traced back to your IP address, Spencer.
What?
That doesn't make any sense.
I haven't touched this laptop all day!
I was with Caleb, watching your speech on his computer at the Brew!
Spencer, please don't lie to me.
You must've hacked into their system.
That's how you knew about my diagnosis.
- No, Mom, that's not howl knew!
- No, she didn't do it.
I did it.
I leaked it.
- Is that true?
- Caleb, why are you saying this?
Do you understand what this means?
They were prepared to do the same to you.
Sometimes you need to make a preemptive strike.
That wasn't your call to make.
Mom, he didn't do this.
Well, you'll need to resign from this campaign.
Immediately.
Mom!
And it would also be wise to gather your things and leave here.
Tonight.
(ENGINE REVVING)

(BREATHING HEAVILY)

(CAR DOOR CLOSES)
So, where are they going for their honeymoon?
Atlantic City.
My mom had a Groupon.
-I'm joking.
-(BOTH LAUGH)
It's some dumpy little motel on the Jersey Shore where they spent a wild college weekend.
Sweet.
Thanks for coming.
I'm glad I did.
It was helpful to hear what your thoughts are on true love and commitment.
I'm so sorry I wasn't completely honest about my history with Ezra.
Okay.
Why did you hold back?
I guess I still wasn't being completely honest with myself.
It's been...
It's been confusing.
Was pretty clear on the page.
If he's the one you were writing about--
I wasn't.
Or maybe I was.
I don't know.
Writing those words, maybe it
gave me the chance to work it out.
And have you?
I think so.
How does it end?
I didn't know until right now.
(EXHALES)
(RINGING)
Hey, Jordan, sorry I haven't called you back.
I've been in full wedding mode.
Well, somebody else's.
But, for ours, I think I picked a date.
How does May 17th sound to you?
Okay.
Well, um, call me back.
Oh, and I love you.
SPENCER:
No.
No, you're not leaving.
Please just go in there and tell my mother the truth.
Spencer, she's two weeks out.
This is the truth she needs to win.
If there needs to be a scapegoat, let it be me.
Not you.
- Caleb, it's not--
- Hey, I will figure out who did this.
You need to find out what Melissa's been up to.
I can only cover for one sister at a time.
Where are you gonna go?
I don't know.
I'll work it out.
I want you to stay.
CALEB:
I know you do.
But I can't.
What happened?
What is that?
EMILY:
What's left of my phone.
Emily, where were you?
Did you go back to the tunnel?
Did your car break down?
I couldn't even make it to my car.
When I did, I was shaking so much I could barely drive.
Emily, were you attacked?
Did Sara Harvey come after you?
I was, but it wasn't her.
- Well, then who?
- I don't know.
Sara Harvey wants this murder solved.
And whoever this was, they want to cover it up.
How do you know that?
- Because I may have found the weapon.
- What?
And they were willing to kill me to get it back.
So what are you saying?
There's now more than one person after us?
There is definitely two.
-(BANGING DOOR)
- Whoa.
Who is that?
(KNOCKING CONTINUES)
You sure someone paid the caterer?
- Hi.
- Hi.
Hi.
I told you it was too late.
She was sleeping.
They weren't sleeping.
- ALISON: on.
Hi. (LAUGHS)
- Hi.
The party's kind of over, guys.
- Um, were you looking to--
- Get married.
-(LAUGHS)
- Tonight.
Alison tells me you're now licensed.
(CHUCKLES)
Wait, you want to get married?
You want me to marry you?
To each other?
-(LAUGHS)
- Right now?
Is English her first language?
- Oh, I cannot do that.
- Why not?
Your twinkle lights are still on in your backyard.
And I have rings.
ALISON:
Please, Aria.
Marry us.

Previously on "Pretty Little Liars..."
We found a hole in Sara's closet in her room at The Radley.
The night Charlotte came home, the night she was murdered someone used a landline from The Two Crows to call this house.
I'm so glad we finally told you.
Now we don't have to sneak around anymore.
Congratulations.
I buried someone who made my life hell for years.
I'm now being questioned in her murder.
I lost my job.
- Come back to New York with me.
- I can't.
Damian, I came to ask you if your article is fully about millennials and politics or if you have another angle.
The murder weapon was a golf club.
What Detective Tanner described was a hollow piece of metal cut with a rectangle at the end.
I've been working with the data from Yvonne's cell phone.
These are my mom's medical records.
How do they have these?
You and I need to talk about Ezra Fitz.
Does he know what you're doing?
You wrote this, big parts of it.
Melissa's suitcase is broken and there's a part missing that's metal, hollow and cut with a rectangle in the end.
Whoa.
Did she check out or get hurled out?
This is what the inside of Sara Harvey's head must look like.
I would have made her lick the carpet before she left.
Okay, let's show Ali the closet.
Urgh!
Who leaves coleslaw in the middle of the floor?
Hanna, closet.
'When you asked the front desk' did they know why she left so fast?
What do you think?
She's not racing off to a Messies Anonymous meeting.
- She knows we're on to her.
- It's gone.
- There's no hole.
- What?
That's impossible.
There's not even a seam where the hole used to be.
Guys, maybe this wasn't her room.
Don't.
Stop cutting Sara any slack.
Hey, I don't care how much she claimed to have loved
Charlotte like a sister.
This girl has two faces.
- We should leave.
- No.
Look, guys, if my mom finds out that I used that key card......
We don't have to introduce ourselves.
We just have to walk out the door.
Emily, stop.
I'm not leaving until we can go back down there.
Okay, she doesn't even believe it exists!
I didn't say that, I'm just trying to understand why she would stalk you.
'Because she thinks we had something' to do with Charlotte's murder.
- She thinks we know who did it!
- Shh!
Alright, let's move.
- Are you giving up?
- Nope, it's done.
- Seriously?
- The file was corrupted.
If they wanna leak your mom's medical report they're gonna have to break into her doctor's office again.
And you're sure that nobody in the Phillips camp could ever trace this back to you?
No way, I mean, they might find an exit node but they'll never figure out where it originated.
The anonymizer software disseminates traffic through multiple sources and....
Did I just put you to sleep?
No, no, I'm not.
I, I just....
I don't really think that this is just gonna go away.
You know, my mom could still be ambushed right before the election.
You're right, but if you tell her that then she's gonna wanna know how you learned about her being sick, and you open that box....
She's got enough to worry about.
Hey, let's make you some breakfast.
You need protein.
Fingernails can only supply so much.
When did you see me chew my fingernails?
In your sleep.
You went after mine first.
- No.
- Yes.
Hey.
Emily, hey, come in.
- Sorry to interrupt.
- No, you're not.
- Uh, you hungry?
- I can't stay.
I've got to get to the bursar's office at Hollis.
What's wrong?
Can you go back down with me?
We'll find another way to get down there.
- Emily, stop.
- I know.
But if Sara Harvey is hiding under the hotel what is she planning next?
Don't do this to yourself, okay?
She may have had nothing to do with the fertility clinic.
She's just playing on your fear.
Yeah, well, it's workin'.
Okay, it's not like someone stole my chapstick.
This person may be storing my future offspring in a Styrofoam cooler.
And if the police don't come up with a suspect soon then Sara's gonna think we're withholding information.
Okay, but we're not withholding anything.
Wh-what was that look?
You guys know something.
- Oh, what?
- No, we know nothing.
- Melissa's suitcase is broken.
- What?
The pull-up handle is missing a rod.
It could've been used as a weapon to crack someone's neck.
Okay, can we please not go there?
Melissa wasn't even in town the night that Charlotte was murdered.
Are you sure about that?
Emily, my mother's election is two weeks away.
I get it, but if Melissa had......
What?
Never wanted to watch Charlotte walk the streets again?
I mean, that pretty much covers everyone who loves us.
Should we add your mom to that suspect list too?
I don't know how to handle this.
- You have to tell him.
- How?
Liam, he spent the last week pounding out chapters.
But if he ships them to Boston before you speak to him......
He won't.
He wants to speak to me first.
He wants feedback.
Did you sleep at all last night?
I'll sleep when I'm unemployed.
- Okay.
- Jillian's gonna fire me.
Or give you a book contract.
She loved what you wrote.
Because she thought that Ezra wrote it.
Okay, one step at a time.
First, tell the author.
Hopefully, he'll be...... flattered.
- Flattered?
- Then he'll call our boss.
Tell her he's had an epiphany and he wants to take the story in another direction.
I think the word is betrayed.
Aria, two weeks ago, this dude was pouring rum on his corn flakes.
He's lucky that someone who once sat in the back of his classroom actually cares enough to save his reputation.
It's-it's not that simple.
I'm gonna tell him this afternoon.
This hasn't even hit the stores yet.
I called in a favor.
It's lovely.
Silk?
Yeah, and if you want, you can pair it with that beaded bolero unless you think that's too mother-of-the-bride.
This mother is a bride.
Did you bring all of these back from New York?
'Yeah, I tried to grab everything' without running into my former boss.
- You can get that.
- Oh, no.
- It's Jordan.
He'll call back.
- No, please, answer it.
I mean, I feel guilty that I'm making you do all this when you have your own wedding......
No, this is work.
And you're doing this now.
We haven't even set a date yet.
So, umm, do you wanna try something on or did I totally strike out?
No, no, not at all.
You did a fabulous job.
It's just when Byron and I first got married umm, we were very determined not be traditional.
So we rented a barn and we basically dressed up like cowhands.
Well, that's cute.
- I mean, I love theme weddings.
- It wasn't a theme.
It was just two cynical college kids with no money and a skewed sense of what was romantic.
We made my mom sit on a keg.
Ugh!
What did she wear?
This time, I wanna feel like more of a bride and I wanna feel elegant.
- I can do elegant.
- I know you can.
Can you show me what you've picked out for yourself or is that a state secret?
Uh, no, I mean, I-I haven't even thought about what I'm gonna wear.
Seriously?
And your mom already sent out shower invitations and you haven't......
You know what?
Give me till the end of the day.
I know the dress.
So sorry to bother.
Can I borrow a pen?
What?
Oh, sure.
Thanks.
Can I also borrow $1000?
I'm lucky if I have enough left to buy a single textbook.
Hold it.
You taking Intro To Psych?
- Yeah.
- Me too.
You know, the professor's supposed to be a real trip.
He's actually giving a lecture tonight.
I was thinking about going and asking a few questions just so I can start off on his good side.
You wanna join?
I-I'll run my questions past you so I don't sound like the village idiot.
You free?
Umm, yeah.
Cool.
I'm Damian.
Emily.
Hey, when did you get back?
- Just now.
- How did it go?
Fine, I guess.
I need a long hot shower.
Whose suitcase is that?
Mine.
What happened to your other one?
It was broken.
I tossed it.
- Good morning.
- It was until I opened my eyes.
Do you have time for a coffee?
Oh, honey, I've already had a pot.
Oh, jeez, Gil, not the Shriners.
We're supposed to be hitting up new voters not resuscitating the dead.
What's going on?
You look like a kid who just dropped her sucker in the sand.
- Honey, what is it?
- You should have told us.
Told you what?
That the cancer came back.
You kept it from us once when you promised us that that would never happen again.
The prognosis was good, so there was no reason......
There's every reason, mom.
I am not one of your constituents.
I'm gonna be fine, Spencer.
How did you find out about this?
That doesn't even matter, but if I know you can bet that your opponent's camp knows as well.
What do they know?
The doctors gave me a clean bill of health.
They supported my bid for office.
How about letting me support you?
Look, I was planning on telling you and Melissa after the election.
But Gil, he, he begged me not to share this.
It would, it would scare off the voters, hijack the platform.
It would be all that anyone would ever ask me about.
So what if they did?
Mom, I work on Capitol Hill.
I know all of the traps.
But you're running on a platform based on transparency and integrity.
Do not set yourself up to be blindsided once you get into the office.
You know, you were the one who taught me that courage is all about having grace under fire.
I mean, it doesn't really get harder than this.
You're right.
Thank you for reminding me why I did this.
Mom, you're gonna make a great senator.
No.
I meant why I had kids.
You get the chance to make people better than yourself.
I love you.

Do you wanna send that back, order something else?
Hmm?
Oh, no, no.
It's tasty.
Listen, uh, okay, so your mother and I have this crazy idea.
Uh, we were thinking how great it would be if we were actually married by someone who really knew us.
Like you.
What?
Dad, I can't officiate your wedding.
I'm not a minister.
Well, no, wait, that's the easy part.
You can just get a license online.
I mean, we would still have to be recognized by the state for the ceremony......
Dad, seriously, you don't want me to do that.
Why not?
You are the writer in this family.
Okay, listen, there's no pressure, okay?
It was just this crazy idea that your mom and I have.
It's not that I don't want to.
I just, I don't want Mike to feel left out or anything.
Oh...... don't worry about Mike.
Your brother's not coming.
Why?
Why, I thought he said he was gonna try to......
I just think he's not, not so happy about this.
That is insane.
Why wouldn't he want you and mom to be back together?
Possibly because he has never forgiven me for why we broke up.
He doesn't trust that I won't hurt her again.
Well, it's his loss because it's gonna be a very special day.
I'll work on the ceremony tonight.
She got her first text.
Wait, so now this freak thinks that Alison's hiding something about the murder too?
That doesn't even make sense.
Well, if it is Sara Harvey, she's probably furious that Alison's talking to us again.
Why is Melissa just sitting there in her car?
Okay.
- Hey.
- Hi.
Turns out my trip was a huge success.
Polls show a 12% gain.
I'm more persuasive than I thought.
Hail to the conqueror.
Hey, do you, umm, have that luggage tag on your old suitcase?
Gil said you really need to submit it if you want......
Forget about it.
The trip's already paid for.
Put the funds toward mom's victory party.
Hey, umm, how did you break your suitcase?
- What?
- I told him about it.
'Cause he just really likes to fix things.
What makes you assume I broke it?
Well, when did you notice it was broken?
When I pulled it out of the cab from the Philly airport.
The idiot took every bumpy, potholed street to avoid baseball traffic.
- Have a nice walk.
- Bye.
I know what you're gonna say.
Well, then I won't say it.
Say it.
Your sister got back into town two Saturdays ago.
- Right?
- Mmm.
The Phillies had an away game that day so that traffic would've been in Baltimore.
Please don't be silent.
Just talk this through with me.
Aria, it's done.
You've already submitted six chapters.
Did Jillian like it?
Was she pleased?
Kinda, yeah.
On a scale of one to ten ten being very pleased, over the moon......
Ezra......
- I need a number.
Nine, eight and a half, I....
Eight and a quarter.
She had notes.
Did she?
And was I receptive?
Ezra, I will go to my boss on Monday and I will tell her the truth.
Aria, you can't do that.
She'll kick you to the curb.
How could she even trust you again?
It's what it is.
No, it isn't.
I know you were trying to protect me.
You saw that I was falling apart and you assumed the worst.
You thought the jury would hand down a lighter sentence if I wrote a painful and gripping story which also has all the makings of a great romantic novel if you wanna write that too.
I can't really tell if you wanna hug me or punch me.
How can I punch you?
This wasn't a career move.
This-this...... was an act of love.
Oh, we-we could just turn in all of it.
I mean, Dickens was paid by the inch.
Oh.
Can I just read what you wrote?
It's probably a lot better than what I have.
Okay, tell me you're not in love.
It's gorgeous.
And I got a simple veil to go with it.
Nothing too insane, but just a little something to add mystery.
The mystery is how am I going to walk in it.
I may need to borrow Emily's legs.
Well, I'll hem it.
You're gonna rock this dress, I promise.
Please try it on.
Oh, wait.
- What about the veil?
- No, that's okay.
I don't want anything to detract from the dress.
You did good.
Your work here is done.
What about the tables?
You want them to complement the dress, right?
Can I please do the tables?
Knock yourself out.
- Hey.
- Hi.
Go back outside.
I don't want you to see the bride.
- It's bad luck.
- I'm not the groom, Hanna.
I'm the minister or officiator, whatever.
Well, I'm styling it, so I guess we'll both be working the party.
Wait, you're gonna be there?
That's weird.
- Why is it weird?
- Because I....
I didn't invite any friends.
I was trying to be sensitive.
Sensitive to what?
Making you sit at a small wedding with Caleb and Spencer two feet from the ceremony.
Would you be comfortable with that?
I have no issue with Spencer and Caleb, alright?
They're great together and we're all different people now.
I'm happy for them.
This is happy.
Ali, what is it?
The night that Charlotte came home....
We stayed up late talking.
And I told her about us.
She stared at me like a cat.
And then she went upstairs.
I could tell that she felt betrayed.
Probably more by me than you.
I was her doctor.
No, I think she was angry at me.
That's why she ran out in the middle of the night.
It may not have been because of a phone call.
I might have delivered my sister....
To whoever did that to her.
Alison, th-that's not true.
The person who failed Charlotte in that moment....
Was me....
Not you.
Hey, how did it go?
Excellent.
I'm now gainfully employed.
Well, at least until tomorrow night.
I'm starved.
Do you wanna order in?
Oh, I'm going to a lecture with a guy from my psych class.
Trying to earn brownie points with the new professor.
Well, congratulations.
At least one of us will have a degree that matters.
I enrolled, Hanna, but it's not like it was four years ago when the only thing I had to worry about in freshman year was catching something from a communal shower curtain.
Emily, you're not gonna have......
Yes, I am, Hanna.
How am I supposed to take notes when the voice in my head is telling me that Sara Harvey is torturing you for something Melissa might have done?
Wait, Melissa Hastings?
Melissa might have called Charlotte from the diner, she could've been the one who lured her out in the middle of the night......
No, no, no, hold on.
Wasn't Melissa in London?
Spencer thinks so.
Caleb doesn't.
Oh, who's Damian?
Uh, he goes to Hollis.
That's who I'm meeting up with.
- Hey, there.
- Hey.
It's a good thing I got here early.
It's insane.
That line behind me is waiting to get in.
- Can you save me a seat?
- Sure.
Yeah, I just wanted to make sure you're still coming.
- I'll see you soon.
- Bye.
He looks familiar.
Did you ever buy any used books from Hollis?
No, but they did actually deliver a box for you this afternoon.
Really?
I haven't ordered any.
Em, what's wrong?
"What To Name The Baby?" What class is that?
Oh, my God.
What does it say?
I've chosen to share this with you because ultimately, my diagnosis was a wake-up call.
'And I trust now that you have this insight' you'll know that I don't give up without a fight.
- Hanna, hey.
- Hey.
Hey, uh, did you get my messages?
No, I'm-I'm so sorry.
I just turned my phone off, so that I could watch.
Are you okay?
I think Melissa could have done it.
I saw your sister years ago in London.
Okay, where are you?
You will never guess who just talked to me.
Okay, so I was in line at the bar and some stranger just compliments my shoes and I turn around, it's Claudia Freakin' Greco, Caleb.
And don't pretend like you don't know who she is.
I have to go.
Melissa?
Hello, Hanna.
- What are you doing here?
- I live here.
Well, not in this bathroom, but nearby.
No, this event.
Fashion Week.
Did you change careers?
I came with a friend who ditched me because I've spent the entire night sobbing into my phone.
Is that drink yours or mine?
Uh, yours.
How's Wren?
He's gone.
He left me.
That scheming nut job who made your life a living hell has now moved on to mess with mine.
You mean Charlotte?
Who the hell gave that twisted sister phone privileges?
I mean, how does someone with her resume get put under penthouse arrest?
I try not to think about her.
You know, forgive and forget.
Yeah, a leopard doesn't change its spots.
Wait, did she call you?
No, she called Wren and clearly, she shared information with him because he's been looking at me for the last week like I should be the one locked up.
And is that because of Bethany Young?
If she's willing to tell him, who else is she gonna tell?
You know, we all have a past, Hanna.
Aren't you curious what she plans to use against you?
Here.
Why don't we call her and find out?
Melissa, stop.
Someone needs to shut her up for good.
Melissa, give me my phone!
I'm doing you a favor.
You'll thank me one day.
Hi, this is Alison DiLaurentis.
Can I please speak to my sister, Charlotte?
- Give me the phone.
- Well, wake her up.
She has her whole life to nap.
Tell her Hanna wants to say hi.
Melissa, stop.
No, I don't wanna speak to her doctor.
I wanna speak to my bloody sister!
Put Charlotte on!
I don't wanna hear her voice!
Well, you have a funny way of forgiving, Hanna.
Why didn't you tell me about this when you came home from that trip?
She didn't want another person telling her that she wasn't over it.
Well, neither was your sister.
So can you at least find out if Melissa called that night from the diner?
Thanks.
Oh, umm, what was the name of that sneaky blogger dude from Hollis?
The one who freaked out you and Melissa?
So what made you decide to come back?
Here...... where you grew up.
What was the, what was the draw?
Oh, uh, my mom was alone so I thought it'd be good to be nearby.
Right.
Hey, do you wanna grab a cup of coffee in here and take it across the street?
- Sure.
That sounds great.
- Yeah.
Great.
How do you take it?
Your coffee?
You know what?
Let's skip the coffee.
Let's grab dinner instead.
Even better.
Ezra Fitz?
Hi, I'm Liam Greene.
Uh, we met once before.
I work with Aria at the publishing house.
That's right.
Yeah.
Umm, what brings you to Rosewood?
Aria invited me to her parents' wedding.
Oh, that's great.
That should be a lot of fun.
In a parents' wedding sort of way.
Yeah.
I'm actually meeting Aria here.
Umm, she suggested that, uh, we go over the chapters I gave her.
Oh, well, I'm anxious to read them myself.
From what I hear, it's a great plot.
Nice twists.
Strong characters.
Yeah.
Umm, I just wanna put it out there.
Uh, the protagonist was inspired by this woman that I traveled the world with.
Uh, it's not Aria.
Umm, I mean, we never ventured out past Philly.
And though some can find romance in the Liberty Bell umm, I just wanted to say this so there's no confusion.
If you thought I was writing about Aria and me, I'm not.
- Hey.
- Oh, look who it is.
Uh, sorry, I'm late, I was working on the ceremony and I must have lost track of time.
Umm, so how long have you two been sitting here?
Umm, not long, but I'll leave you two alone.
I'm sure Mr. Fitz is eager to get his feedback.
Liam.
Liam, wait.
Does Ezra know that you know?
- Know what?
- About me ghostwriting.
No, but at least now I know that Mr. Fitz was more than just your favorite teacher.
Is this why you wanted to stay in Rosewood?
Liam.
Please pick up, pick up.
Please leave a message.
Hey, Liam, it's me again.
Look, I'm so sorry, okay?
Just....
I-I need a chance to explain.
Call me.
Oh, but not after 5:00.
I'll...... be marrying my parents.
Bye.
- Have you eaten today?
- I can't remember.
- What day is it?
- It's your wedding day.
You can't be nervous.
You've married Byron before.
'True, it makes no logical sense' but when he walks in the room, it's like I'm 19 again.
God, help me.
Well, I think it's fate.
People who are meant to be together take a break and then find their way back to their first love.
What's more romantic than that?
Oh, Byron wasn't my first love.
His name was Ricky Eichler.
He played the drums and had green eyes that you could drown in and he was sexy and badass and I thought we would be together forever.
- What happened to him?
- Who knows?
We graduated and we grew up.
I'll call him back.
Is that message for me?
How long are you gonna avoid me?
I'm not avoiding you.
I'm trying......
Alison, I will give you as much space as you need.
I just don't wanna be pushed away because you feel unnecessary guilt.
I'm......
I'm feeling a lot of things.
Is there any way you can look at me and not see your sister?
I'm here, Alison.
I'm alive.
And I love you.
And I wanna spend the rest of my life with you.
What are you saying?
Exactly what you think I said.
I mean, Gil said that....
Hey, I wanted to say congratulations but by the time we got home, you were already asleep.
Oh, it was an exhausting day.
What's wrong?
Apparently, while I was recording the speech a story came out intended to crush my opponent.
Well, that's politics.
Some days you're the pigeon, some days you're the statue.
Don't be glib.
This could destroy all the goodwill mom just earned.
How?
Why would anything about Christine Phillips affect mom's speech?
It's not about Christine.
- It's about her daughter.
- Yvonne?
Why?
What did she do?
She got rid of an unwanted pregnancy in high school.
'And someone was able to dredge up a medical report' which is more than just a little embarrassing when you're running on a pro-life platform.
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah, it gets worse.
The Phillips camp believes the leak came out of our office.
There's a full-on investigation underway.
Any idea who would have put that out there?
'I had a drink with Damian and all I could get out of him' was that Melissa was definitely back before Charlotte was released.
She could have made that call from the diner.
Okay, this place is either really unpopular or really closed.
Hanna, call me back.
The reception out here sucks, but keep trying.
Oh, and send me some wedding pictures.
Hello, is anybody there?
Hello?
Who are we when we're alone?
And who are we when we're with this other person?
Are we really ready to be with another person before we truly know ourselves?
My parents have answered these questions.
They know exactly who they are and what they want.
As individuals, each of them is loving, wise and sensitive.
Together, they're more.
They're inspiring.
So here they are together again making a new commitment to be there for the best week ever and the worst week ever which sometimes happens in the same week.
Byron, Ella do you promise to love, comfort and honor each other for the rest of your lives?
We do.
Then I now pronounce you husband and wife.
Dad, you may kiss mom.
But remember, you're doing it in front of your daughter.
It can't be Mona.
- You don't know that.
- I do.
I made it clear, if she messes with this family she's gonna be back underground breathing through a straw.
Okay, so what?
You think Sara Harvey did this?
Forgive the intrusion, but I just got off the phone with Gil.
- What did he say?
- Maybe you should come inside.
I am inside.
What did he say?
Christine Phillips hired an expert who tracked the source of the leak.
What is going on?
It was traced back to your IP address, Spencer.
What?
That doesn't make any sense.
I haven't touched this laptop all day.
I was with Caleb watching your speech on his computer at The Brew......
Spencer, please, don't lie to me.
You must have hacked into their system.
That's how you knew about my diagnosis.
No, mom, that's not how I knew......
No, she didn't do it.
I did it.
I leaked it.
Is that true?
Caleb, why are you saying this?
Do you understand what this means?
They were prepared to do the same to you.
I....
Sometimes you need to make a preemptive strike.
That wasn't your call to make.
Mom, he didn't do this.
Well, you'll need to resign from this campaign immediately.
And it would also be wise to gather your things and leave here...... tonight.
So where are they going for their honeymoon?
Atlantic City.
My mom had a Groupon.
I'm joking.
It's some dumpy, little motel on the Jersey Shore where they spent a wild college weekend.
Sweet.
Thanks for coming.
I'm glad I did.
It was helpful to hear what your thoughts are on true love and...... commitment.
I am...... so sorry.
I wasn't completely honest about my....
History with Ezra.
Okay.
Why did you hold back?
I guess I still wasn't being completely honest with myself.
It's been....
It's been confusing.
It was pretty clear on the page.
If he's the one you were writing about......
I wasn't or....
Maybe I was.
I don't know.
Writing those words....
Maybe it...... gave me the chance to work it out.
And have you?
I think so.
How does it end?
I didn't know until right now.
Hey, Jordan, sorry, I haven't called you back.
I've been in full wedding mode.
Well, somebody else's.
But for ours, I think I picked a date.
How does May 17 sound to you?
Okay, well, umm, call me back.
Oh, and I love you.
No.
No, you're not leaving.
Please, just go in there and tell my mother the truth.
Spencer, she's two weeks out.
This is the truth she needs to win.
If there needs to be a scapegoat, let it be me.
- Not you.
- Caleb......
Hey, I will figure out who did this.
You need to find out what Melissa's been up to.
I can cover for one sister at a time.
Where are you gonna go?
I don't know.
I'll-I'll work it out.
I want you to stay.
I know you do....
But I can't.
What happened?
What is that?
What's left of my phone.
Emily, where were you?
Did you go back to the tunnel?
Did your car break down?
I couldn't even make it to my car.
And when I did, I was shaking so much, I could barely drive.
Emily, were you attacked?
Did Sara Harvey come after you?
- I was, but it wasn't her.
- Well, then who?
I don't know.
Sara Harvey wants this murder solved.
Whoever this was, they wanna cover it up.
How do you know that?
Because they may have found the weapon.
What?
They were willing to kill me to get it back.
So what are you saying?
There's now more than one person after us?
There's definitely two.
Whoa!
Who is that?
Sure someone paid the caterer?
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- I told you it was too late.
- She was sleeping.
- They weren't sleeping.
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.
Party's kinda over, guys.
Umm, were you guys looking......
Get married...... tonight.
Alison tells me you're now licensed.
Wait, you wanna get married?
You want me to marry you?
To each other?
Right now?
Is English her first language?
Oh, I cannot do that.
Why not?
Your twinkle lights are still on in your backyard.
And I have rings.
Please, Aria, marry us.
Previously on Empire...
- Will you marry me?
- Yes.
If only Cookie knew what you did while she was away in prison.
Wouldn't be such a Sister Sledge reunion now, would it?
The Lyon family will be performing at this year's ASA awards.
Me and my son are not the only people up for this award.
I'm just saying,
I'm ready to play.
You ready to play?
I was born to play.
The board would like you to come on as co-CEOs.
I think it's a fantastic idea.
I got your back.
Hi, Grandma, it's Andre.
I wish I could have met you.
That woman's name is Leah Walker.
I believe she's your grandmother.
N-43.
It's right there.
She has a system... and the system's called cheating.
Well, I haven't noticed her cheating, so... it's okay.
I-27.
They treat you okay here?
Not Mondays.
I hate meat loaf.
She means Meatloaf Mondays, which are delicious.
Thank you.
I-29.
So, how about your family?
Does your family come visit you?
- B-7.
- Oh!
Oh... bingo!
That round was for the watercolor set.
Check his card!
The boy's famous now.
The boy.
Is the boy your son?
I had the voice, but they never gave me a chance.
They didn't want me to.
Your eyes.

- It's a dope song, right?
- It's dope!
Now, look, all I got to get is this song on the Ryan Coogler movie and it instantly gets me famous.
I can't believe that this came about from Ryan hearing your stripper joint.
Worked for Lil Jon, didn't it?
- True.
- That's exactly what he's looking for, too.
Although he is a little worried about who's gonna sing the girl part.
I was thinking Tiana.
Tiana?
Yeah...
Tiana could work 'cause she's real hot off of her tour, but...
But what?
You don't think Laura would have a problem with that?
Nah, you overthinking it.
It's just business.
Laura totally gets it.
She gets it.
So, we're gonna trace the
Lyon family sound from Lucious in the early Philly days to Jamal's new album, but I need seven minutes of stage time, not four.
Seven minutes?
- Yeah.
- You pushing it, Cookie.
Oh, that's what I do.
No.
Mr. D-Major.
Oh, the god of the ASAs, himself.
Oh, what's good, B?
I'm so proud of you.
I knew you had it.
I got something.
You talking about Lucious Lyon, classic monster?
This is what we're gonna do for the ASAs.
Well, actually,
I was thinking we base the Lyon Family Anthem off of one of Jamal's.
He is Empire's most nominated artist.
And that is a dope idea, because I can produce a remix to the song and I can add a verse for you, and then one for Hakeem...
Wait, wait, wait, wait, you're gonna have to slow your flaps on that.
Look, I run the music on this thing.
- Hey!
- We gonna...
Hi, hi, you forgot, I'm co-CEO.
"Co" as in co-pilot, and I will call you if I need a bathroom break.
- Oh, what's wrong, Pufnstuf?
- Look, I...
You mad 'cause you been on that cleanse for a week and you ain't lost no weight, fat-ass?
Funny.
Would you like to meet Empire's most nominated artist?
He's looking at him.
No, he ain't... we talking about the present, not the past.

Oh, Jamal, come here, baby!
- Hey, Ma.
- You know D-Major,
- musical director for the ASAs.
- Of course.
Congrats, man.
I'm super stoked that you're doing the ASAs.
Well, I'm stoked about the remix.
I wasn't a big fan of the single, but it's perfect for the Lyon Family Anthem.
Okay...
I'm not sure what we're talking about.
I'm doing one of my new songs.
Oh, no... your mama traded in your solo.
It's gonna be huge, Jamal.
The whole family on the stage...
Mama, no, I...
I-I can't trade in my solo.
Dude, this is the ASAs.
It's the biggest stage in the world.
Now, if you want to be on it,
I wouldn't be throwing some hissy fit.
Porsha, hold up.
Here.
You think I got time to read?
This is the Bible.
It's been handed down from assistant to assistant since the... will you take it?
God.
It tells you what to do, what not to do, who to call...
Cookie got a promotion.
That means you got a promotion now, too, so... read it cover to cover.
Thank you.
No, don't-don't thank me.
You work for a CEO now, so it's time to step your game up.
This is the stage layout right here.
Check on those...
Hey, Hakeem.
Hakeem!
Yeah.
- Got a verse for me?
- Mom,
I'm not singing backup for Lucious at the ASAs.
I got my own thing I'm working on.
Boy, it's not backup... and you can chew gum and walk at the same time, can't you?
Look... rehearsal at Laviticus, don't be late.
All right.
Yeah, all right.
Nice place, Loretha.
What'd I tell you about calling me by my government name?
Look, whatever it is you came for,
Candace, we ain't got time.
Hey, is something wrong with my kids?
Yes.
They're not with their mother, and it's time they should be.
Look, Candace, please don't start all of that.
You know she just got out of rehab.
She needs to focus.
Just because you weren't around to raise your kids doesn't mean we're gonna follow your example, Cookie.
When the winter break is over, the kids are coming here.
Hey, wait a minute.
You know I only have a two-bedroom apartment.
then I suggest you invest in some bunk beds.
I'm serious, Carol.
You know what... you need to talk to your sister before I kick her ass.
Candace.
Candace!
It's weak.

But I'm tired of singing songs from the past.
This is new stuff.
Son... there's ways to change my mind, but ambushing me in the middle of my session is not it.
Excuse me.
Look, man, if it was not for me, there would be no Lyon Anthem, so I suggest you talk to me.
You need not to grab me, dude.
Everybody out.
Now!
- Wink, shut the door.
- Yeah, man.
Look, all I'm saying is that...
Yeah, man, I get it, you're a visionary artist, but I got a hundred artists that I have to juggle, plus produce the show, so if you're not happy, I suggest you go
talk to your mother.
I'm not talking to my mother, I'm talking to you.
What...
Yeah.
Been wanting to do that ever since I seen you in the lobby this morning, and then you come into my meeting, take it over.

You know what I mean?
I can't see Ryan Coogler not putting this on the soundtrack.
Soundtrack?
I definitely want that on my next album.
It's 1:00?
I thought it was 10:00.
Laura gonna kill me.
Wow... the Hakeem
I knew would want to go to the club right now... but I guess you can't, huh?
Since you got a wifey... and a baby mama.
What, you got jokes?
I'm just...
Look, I can go to the club if I want, but Cookie got me focusing on this ASA thing, so...
Well, we're definitely gonna miss you.
Okay, I need you to put that on table 7, those go on table...
You know, according to the Empire HR bible, setting out tables and stuff is not the job of the CEO assistants.
- Oh, really?
- Mm-hmm.
Would you like a demotion?
I can arrange that.
I'll do it today.
Yeah, I know you will.
Sure.
Rough night?
Yeah.
But I ain't complaining, fool.
Gots to love it.
I don't know who ordered all this stuff, but I want it all 86ed out of here.
Yo, what's that green mess, anyway?
Dad's on a fast for the ASAs, 'cause Mom let him know that TV puts ten pounds on you.
No, he's doing it for his health.
Um, so I got a rough script.
Andre's gonna start with some narration to set up the scene;
he should be here in a minute.
Dad, that's not it.
You don't think that sounds played out?
It honestly sounds like you're trying to make my song sound like your old song.
Well, if it sounds played out, it means you wrote a played out song.
I wrote a played out song?
- I'm trying to fix...
- No, you don't want to change it
- and you sound...
- Listen, I'm not down with all of this R B back and forth.
Mom, where's my verse supposed to be?
- Okay, pause.
- I'm supposed to sing on the bridge?
Pause!
I'm running this.
I got this, and of course we're gonna find somewhere for your verse, Hakeem... and Lucious, your verse can be a flip on Jamal's, and Jamal, it's your song.
Thank you, Mom, thank you.
- See, it's my song.
- You know what?
This ain't working.
I want to go back to my original plan.
What original plan, Dad?
Where we do the song where you accuse us of biting the hand that never really fed us?
- Oh, you didn't eat?
- Nah, he talking about the song
- that he wrote back when - he thought Mom was snitch bitch.
Now, y'all sound like a rack of bitches, okay?
Lucious can sit up here and take y'all's jaw jacking, but I'm not 'cause I'm running this show.
- Excuse me?
- Yeah, excuse me.
I busted my ass to finally get here and I'll be damned if I let y'all mess it up.
So put your big girl drawers on, 'cause we gonna come together and do this as a family.
Does anybody here know what that means?
That's an intriguing question... and I have someone here with me that might have a point of view.
It's okay, Grandma.
This is your family.
Lucious...
Whose grandmother?
What do you mean Grandma?
Who is this lady?
Lucious.
Dwight?
Andre, what's going on?
This is Leah Walker...
Lucious' mother.
Andre, our grandmother's dead.
What, you got nothing to say?
You want to tell them about how you... sent her away to a home for 21 years, never looked back?
Or how about how you sent Vernon out there once a month to pay out hush money to anybody who knew who she really was... how about that one, huh?
Dad, what?
Yeah, that's not true.
It's not.
No, Harper Scott gave me her files.
Can't lie your way out of this one, Pop.
You have no... idea what you've done.
I can't believe that just happened.
Yeah, it's deeper than we think, too.
You see the look on his face?
What's good, Lyon brothers?
Here to check out your rehearsal.
Hey, yo, Laura blowing me up.
- Meet you up, bro.
- All right.
Baby...
Yo.
Yo, you might not want to go back there;
Lucious and Cookie are trying to figure
- some things out.
- Yeah, well, maybe I can help.
No, no, it's family stuff.
Besides, you really expect me to believe that you only came for rehearsal?
Yeah, that's my job, but if I'm not needed, then I'm out.
Lucious...
Yeah, baby?
Why did you lie?
I didn't lie about anything.
Then what was that video about?
The truth.
My mother did try and drown me.
She did put a gun to her head and pulled the trigger, and told an eight-year-old boy that it was his fault she was the way she is.
Just turns out there was no bullets in the gun.
Well, if she didn't die then...
No... my mother died the day that they locked her up.
And then remember how under Reagan the government took all the mentally ill patients and dumped them out on the street?
Well, one day in front of 30th Street Station,
I damn near tripped over her.
Now you and me, we were on welfare and had two and a half kids, we couldn't take care of her if we wanted to.
You just... you could have at least told me about her, Lucious.
I couldn't.
I needed her to stay dead.
That's why I took Andre to the grave.
He just wouldn't leave it alone, you know.
But he just doesn't understand.
I mean, none of y'all understand how... dangerous she really is.
- Why didn't you tell me?
- How did you even find out?
What, you were snooping through my computer?
It doesn't matter how I found out.
What matters is, Tiana's doing a duet with you on a song you yourself told me would go platinum.
The producers wanted her.
It was out of my control, babe.
You could have pushed for me.
I bet you never even brought me up.
Baby...
I love you.
Okay?
You know that.
But you can't automatically think you're gonna be on all my duets.
Trust me, there'll be other opportunities.
I trust you.
I just don't trust Tiana.
She's still feeling you.
So what if she is?
I want you.
I don't trust him, okay?
I think she needs to stay with us until we find a permanent situation.
No, Andre, we're staying in a hotel.
- We can get her an adjoining room, babe.
- Oh...
I think we should at least talk to her caregivers.
I mean, do you even know who her doctors are?
Great.
This will be fun.
Come on, Granny Groove.
What the hell?
Whoopsy daisy.
Hey!
Where the hell you think you're going, man?
Hey, Andre.
- No, where you going?
- Andre!
- Andre, fall back.
- Fall back?
!
- What you talking...
- I don't know what you think you're gonna get out of this, but that's not
- what you want right now.
- You're the one who hid her
- from everybody, you did that.
- I didn't hide her.
You think she's like you.
She's a completely different kind of person.
Andre... she needs to be back at the home, baby.
You don't know how miserable she was in that home, Ma.
She needs to be with professionals.
You don't know, you don't know about it.
Grandma, listen...
I got your medicine and your suitcase with all your things, all right?
I got plenty of room for you.
- We're gonna go home, okay?
- Andre...
I want to go home...
Yeah, we're going home, we're going home.
...with my Dwight.
Dwight...
I want to go to bed now.
I'll have the nurse take you to your room.
Juanita.
Yes, sir.
I want you to make sure she takes each and every one of her pills.
Watch her put them in her mouth.
Check to make sure she swallowed them.
Remove the phone out of her room, and nobody comes to see her without my permission.
And no matter what, you don't take your eyes off of her, okay?
Yes, sir.

I thought we were going to Lucious'?
You said he wanted to make a statement.
Can I ask you something, Ms. Scott?
Why did you become a journalist?
Because I believe in the truth.
Hmm, see, that's why I became an attorney.
The truth is nowhere near as important as what you can persuade people to believe.
Case in point...
Do you believe running your mouth about Leah Walker can get you hurt?
Lucious should know that
I can't be threatened or bought.
Mm-hmm.
That's what he thought.
What are you gonna do?
Kill me and leave me by the side of the road?
I resent that...
I'm a gentleman.

This ain't necessary.
I got the message loud and clear, so...
What about this message?
Come on, man, stop playing with me.
I thought you ain't feeling me.
I'm feeling you.
Why would I not be feeling you?
Hmm?
'Cause you blew me off like it was nothing.
We were in a work situation.
I try to keep things professional, man.
And because you're not out.
Hmm?
I don't think it's anybody's business, man.
But it is when you're in a club with a hot girl, then it's all of the paparazzi's business.
Look, you're making a big deal out of this.
It is a big deal... to me, it's important.
You know, I worked damn hard to walk in my truth.
That's why I thought you would understand where I'm coming from, man.

Hmm...
You're afraid... that if this gets out, it'll be a scandal.
Yeah, you're afraid you're gonna lose all that love you got for "Boom Boom Boom Boom."
Trust me, this gets out, it's not good for nobody.
It ain't gonna get out, Lucious.
Just as long as you do right by your sons.
So that's what this is about?
Damn ASA performance?
You trying to get me to do the song
Jamal's way, huh?
This is not about the ASAs, stupid.
This is about you.
You sitting up here, acting like you still in those Philly projects, when you the king.
You the king of the world, and there is nothing to fear.
Especially not from your own mama.
Get yourself together.
I'm the one that should be drinking around here.
Thank you for coming, Candace.
You're welcome.
Uh, Candace, listen, I really need for you to keep my kids just a little while longer.
They need their mother.
Well, you know, I'm about to get my 90-day chip and...
And?
I just need a little more time to make things right with everyone.
What do you mean by that?
I want to tell Cookie... about what Lucious and I did...
Hell to the no!
No, but come on, I'm not like y'all;
I can't live with secrets.
It's not a secret.
It's an atomic bomb.
What you gonna say, huh?
"Cookie...
"here's your morning papers,
"and by the way,
"I helped Lucious murder a few people while you were locked up"?
Wait a second.
I promised Cookie I would help
Lucious stay out of trouble.
- Well...
- All right, he made me his line-up girl.
I did not do anything to hurt anybody... but it... it is weighing on me, and I got to get this off me.
You need to suck it up, 'cause the last thing we need is Hurricane Cookie going Category Five on our asses.
Oh, no... mm-mm.

Thank you.
Yo, Anika, where do you want us to put this?
You guys can put it right over there.
Thank you.

He even baby-proofed the Jacuzzi.
I know, I know, right?
I am impressed.
Rhonda, thank you.
Thank you for all this amazing stuff and... you and Andre, y-you're so generous.
Honestly, you did not have to do this.
It's nothing, really.
I feel like... if... when we try again, I...
I just... want a fresh start.
I don't want to be reminded...
- Watch out!
- Oh, my God!
Are you okay?
I am so sorry.
Hell!
Are you all right?
Yeah.
That was so weird.
I didn't mean to...
What's wrong?

- It's a dope song, right?
- It's dope!
Now, look, all I got to get is this song on the Ryan Coogler movie and it instantly gets me famous.
I can't believe that this came about from Ryan hearing your stripper joint.
Worked for Lil Jon, didn't it?
- True.
- That's exactly what he's looking for, too.
Although he is a little worried about who's gonna sing the girl part.
I was thinking Tiana.
Tiana?
Yeah...
Tiana could work 'cause she's real hot off of her tour, but...
But what?
You don't think Laura would have a problem with that?
Nah, you overthinking it.
It's just business.
Laura totally gets it.
She gets it.
So, we're gonna trace the
Lyon family sound from Lucious in the early Philly days to Jamal's new album, but I need seven minutes of stage time, not four.
Seven minutes?
- Yeah.
- You pushing it, Cookie.
Oh, that's what I do.
No.
Mr. D-Major.
Oh, the god of the ASAs, himself.
Oh, what's good, B?
I'm so proud of you.
I knew you had it.
I got something.
You talking about Lucious Lyon, classic monster?
This is what we're gonna do for the ASAs.
Well, actually,
I was thinking we base the Lyon Family Anthem off of one of Jamal's.
He is Empire's most nominated artist.
And that is a dope idea, because I can produce a remix to the song and I can add a verse for you, and then one for Hakeem...
Wait, wait, wait, wait, you're gonna have to slow your flaps on that.
Look, I run the music on this thing.
- Hey!
- We gonna...
Hi, hi, you forgot, I'm co-CEO.
"Co" as in co-pilot, and I will call you if I need a bathroom break.
- Oh, what's wrong, Pufnstuf?
- Look, I...
You mad 'cause you been on that cleanse for a week and you ain't lost no weight, fat-ass?
Funny.
Would you like to meet Empire's most nominated artist?
He's looking at him.
No, he ain't... we talking about the present, not the past.

Shouldn't your face be up there, too, Cookie?
It'd be obsolete before they ever finished it.

Oh, Jamal, come here, baby!
- Hey, Ma.
- You know D-Major,
- musical director for the ASAs.
- Of course.
Congrats, man.
I'm super stoked that you're doing the ASAs.
Well, I'm stoked about the remix.
I wasn't a big fan of the single, but it's perfect for the Lyon Family Anthem.
Okay...
I'm not sure what we're talking about.
I'm doing one of my new songs.
Oh, no... your mama traded in your solo.
It's gonna be huge, Jamal.
The whole family on the stage...
Mama, no, I...
I-I can't trade in my solo.
Dude, this is the ASAs.
It's the biggest stage in the world.
Now, if you want to be on it,
I wouldn't be throwing some hissy fit.
Porsha, hold up.
Here.
You think I got time to read?
This is the Bible.
It's been handed down from assistant to assistant since the... will you take it?
God.
It tells you what to do, what not to do, who to call...
Cookie got a promotion.
That means you got a promotion now, too, so... read it cover to cover.
Thank you.
No, don't-don't thank me.
You work for a CEO now, so it's time to step your game up.
This is the stage layout right here.
Check on those...
Hey, Hakeem.
Hakeem!
Yeah.
- Got a verse for me?
- Mom,
I'm not singing backup for Lucious at the ASAs.
I got my own thing I'm working on.
Boy, it's not backup... and you can chew gum and walk at the same time, can't you?
Look... rehearsal at Laviticus, don't be late.
All right.
Yeah, all right.
Nice place, Loretha.
What'd I tell you about calling me by my government name?
Look, whatever it is you came for,
Candace, we ain't got time.
Hey, is something wrong with my kids?
Yes.
They're not with their mother, and it's time they should be.
Look, Candace, please don't start all of that.
You know she just got out of rehab.
She needs to focus.
Just because you weren't around to raise your kids doesn't mean we're gonna follow your example, Cookie.
When the winter break is over, the kids are coming here.
Hey, wait a minute.
You know I only have a two-bedroom apartment.
then I suggest you invest in some bunk beds.
I'm serious, Carol.
You know what... you need to talk to your sister before I kick her ass.
Candace.
Candace!
It's weak.

It's fire, but I'm on the Lyon Family Anthem tip.

But I'm tired of singing songs from the past.
This is new stuff.
Son... there's ways to change my mind, but ambushing me in the middle of my session is not it.
Excuse me.
Look, man, if it was not for me, there would be no Lyon Anthem, so I suggest you talk to me.
You need not to grab me, dude.
Everybody out.
Now!
- Wink, shut the door.
- Yeah, man.
Look, all I'm saying is that...
Yeah, man, I get it, you're a visionary artist, but I got a hundred artists that I have to juggle, plus produce the show, so if you're not happy, I suggest you go
talk to your mother.
I'm not talking to my mother, I'm talking to you.
What...
Yeah.
Been wanting to do that ever since I seen you in the lobby this morning, and then you come into my meeting, take it over.
You go for what you want, and so do I.

You know what I mean?
I can't see Ryan Coogler not putting this on the soundtrack.
Soundtrack?
I definitely want that on my next album.
It's 1:00?
I thought it was 10:00.
Laura gonna kill me.
Wow... the Hakeem
I knew would want to go to the club right now... but I guess you can't, huh?
Since you got a wifey... and a baby mama.
What, you got jokes?
I'm just...
Look, I can go to the club if I want, but Cookie got me focusing on this ASA thing, so...
Well, we're definitely gonna miss you.
Okay, I need you to put that on table 7, those go on table...
You know, according to the Empire HR bible, setting out tables and stuff is not the job of the CEO assistants.
- Oh, really?
- Mm-hmm.
Would you like a demotion?
I can arrange that.
I'll do it today.
Yeah, I know you will.
Sure.
Rough night?
Yeah.
But I ain't complaining, fool.
Gots to love it.
I don't know who ordered all this stuff, but I want it all 86ed out of here.
Yo, what's that green mess, anyway?
Dad's on a fast for the ASAs, 'cause Mom let him know that TV puts ten pounds on you.
No, he's doing it for his health.
Um, so I got a rough script.
Andre's gonna start with some narration to set up the scene;
he should be here in a minute.
Dad, that's not it.
You don't think that sounds played out?
It honestly sounds like you're trying to make my song sound like your old song.
Well, if it sounds played out, it means you wrote a played out song.
I wrote a played out song?
- I'm trying to fix...
- No, you don't want to change it
- and you sound...
- Listen, I'm not down with all of this R B back and forth.
Mom, where's my verse supposed to be?
- Okay, pause.
- I'm supposed to sing on the bridge?
Pause!
I'm running this.
I got this, and of course we're gonna find somewhere for your verse, Hakeem... and Lucious, your verse can be a flip on Jamal's, and Jamal, it's your song.
Thank you, Mom, thank you.
- See, it's my song.
- You know what?
This ain't working.
I want to go back to my original plan.
What original plan, Dad?
Where we do the song where you accuse us of biting the hand that never really fed us?
- Oh, you didn't eat?
- Nah, he talking about the song
- that he wrote back when - he thought Mom was snitch bitch.
Now, y'all sound like a rack of bitches, okay?
Lucious can sit up here and take y'all's jaw jacking, but I'm not 'cause I'm running this show.
- Excuse me?
- Yeah, excuse me.
I busted my ass to finally get here and I'll be damned if I let y'all mess it up.
So put your big girl drawers on, 'cause we gonna come together and do this as a family.
Does anybody here know what that means?
That's an intriguing question... and I have someone here with me that might have a point of view.
It's okay, Grandma.
This is your family.
Lucious...
Whose grandmother?
What do you mean Grandma?
Who is this lady?
Lucious.
Dwight?
Andre, what's going on?
This is Leah Walker...
Lucious' mother.
Andre, our grandmother's dead.
What, you got nothing to say?
You want to tell them about how you... sent her away to a home for 21 years, never looked back?
Or how about how you sent Vernon out there once a month to pay out hush money to anybody who knew who she really was... how about that one, huh?
Dad, what?
Yeah, that's not true.
It's not.
No, Harper Scott gave me her files.
Can't lie your way out of this one, Pop.
You have no... idea what you've done.
I can't believe that just happened.
Yeah, it's deeper than we think, too.
You see the look on his face?
What's good, Lyon brothers?
Here to check out your rehearsal.
Hey, yo, Laura blowing me up.
- Meet you up, bro.
- All right.
Baby...
Yo.
Yo, you might not want to go back there;
Lucious and Cookie are trying to figure
- some things out.
- Yeah, well, maybe I can help.
No, no, it's family stuff.
Besides, you really expect me to believe that you only came for rehearsal?
Yeah, that's my job, but if I'm not needed, then I'm out.
Lucious...
Yeah, baby?
Why did you lie?
I didn't lie about anything.
Then what was that video about?
The truth.
My mother did try and drown me.
She did put a gun to her head and pulled the trigger, and told an eight-year-old boy that it was his fault she was the way she is.
Just turns out there was no bullets in the gun.
Well, if she didn't die then...
No... my mother died the day that they locked her up.
And then remember how under Reagan the government took all the mentally ill patients and dumped them out on the street?
Well, one day in front of 30th Street Station,
I damn near tripped over her.
Now you and me, we were on welfare and had two and a half kids, we couldn't take care of her if we wanted to.
You just... you could have at least told me about her, Lucious.
I couldn't.
I needed her to stay dead.
That's why I took Andre to the grave.
He just wouldn't leave it alone, you know.
But he just doesn't understand.
I mean, none of y'all understand how... dangerous she really is.
- Why didn't you tell me?
- How did you even find out?
What, you were snooping through my computer?
It doesn't matter how I found out.
What matters is, Tiana's doing a duet with you on a song you yourself told me would go platinum.
The producers wanted her.
It was out of my control, babe.
You could have pushed for me.
I bet you never even brought me up.
Baby...
I love you.
Okay?
You know that.
But you can't automatically think you're gonna be on all my duets.
Trust me, there'll be other opportunities.
I trust you.
I just don't trust Tiana.
She's still feeling you.
So what if she is?
I want you.
I don't trust him, okay?
I think she needs to stay with us until we find a permanent situation.
No, Andre, we're staying in a hotel.
- We can get her an adjoining room, babe.
- Oh...
I think we should at least talk to her caregivers.
I mean, do you even know who her doctors are?
Great.
This will be fun.
Come on, Granny Groove.
What the hell?
Whoopsy daisy.
Hey!
Where the hell you think you're going, man?
Hey, Andre.
- No, where you going?
- Andre!
- Andre, fall back.
- Fall back?
!
- What you talking...
- I don't know what you think you're gonna get out of this, but that's not
- what you want right now.
- You're the one who hid her
- from everybody, you did that.
- I didn't hide her.
You think she's like you.
She's a completely different kind of person.
Andre... she needs to be back at the home, baby.
You don't know how miserable she was in that home, Ma.
She needs to be with professionals.
You don't know, you don't know about it.
Grandma, listen...
I got your medicine and your suitcase with all your things, all right?
I got plenty of room for you.
- We're gonna go home, okay?
- Andre...
I want to go home...
Yeah, we're going home, we're going home.
...with my Dwight.
Dwight...
I want to go to bed now.
I'll have the nurse take you to your room.
Juanita.
Yes, sir.
I want you to make sure she takes each and every one of her pills.
Watch her put them in her mouth.
Check to make sure she swallowed them.
Remove the phone out of her room, and nobody comes to see her without my permission.
And no matter what, you don't take your eyes off of her, okay?
Yes, sir.

You said he wanted to make a statement.
Can I ask you something, Ms. Scott?
Why did you become a journalist?
Because I believe in the truth.
Hmm, see, that's why I became an attorney.
The truth is nowhere near as important as what you can persuade people to believe.
Case in point...
Do you believe running your mouth about Leah Walker can get you hurt?
Lucious should know that
I can't be threatened or bought.
Mm-hmm.
That's what he thought.
What are you gonna do?
Kill me and leave me by the side of the road?
I resent that...

I thought you ain't feeling me.
I'm feeling you.
Why would I not be feeling you?
Hmm?
'Cause you blew me off like it was nothing.
We were in a work situation.
I try to keep things professional, man.
And because you're not out.
Hmm?
I don't think it's anybody's business, man.
But it is when you're in a club with a hot girl, then it's all of the paparazzi's business.

Now, I like you a lot, I do... but this whole thing... it's not for me, so, please...
I don't think that whiskey is a part of your juicing cleanse.
What are you afraid of, huh?
She's just a... feeble, fragile, little old lady.
So that's what you think, huh?
That's what she wants everybody to think.
Hmm...
You're afraid... that if this gets out, it'll be a scandal.
Yeah, you're afraid you're gonna lose all that love you got for "Boom Boom Boom Boom."
Trust me, this gets out, it's not good for nobody.
It ain't gonna get out, Lucious.
Just as long as you do right by your sons.
So that's what this is about?
Damn ASA performance?
You trying to get me to do the song
Jamal's way, huh?
This is not about the ASAs, stupid.
This is about you.
You sitting up here, acting like you still in those Philly projects, when you the king.
You the king of the world, and there is nothing to fear.
Especially not from your own mama.

Thank you for coming, Candace.
You're welcome.
Uh, Candace, listen, I really need for you to keep my kids just a little while longer.
They need their mother.
Well, you know, I'm about to get my 90-day chip and...
And?
I just need a little more time to make things right with everyone.
What do you mean by that?
I want to tell Cookie... about what Lucious and I did...
Hell to the no!
No, but come on, I'm not like y'all;
I can't live with secrets.
It's not a secret.
It's an atomic bomb.
What you gonna say, huh?
"Cookie...
"here's your morning papers,
"and by the way,
"I helped Lucious murder a few people while you were locked up"?
Wait a second.
I promised Cookie I would help
Lucious stay out of trouble.
- Well...
- All right, he made me his line-up girl.
I did not do anything to hurt anybody... but it... it is weighing on me, and I got to get this off me.
You need to suck it up, 'cause the last thing we need is Hurricane Cookie going Category Five on our asses.

I am so sorry.
Hell!

So, do we get our primetime spot at the ASAs?
Fire, fire... and more fire.
You did it.
Mama's a beast.
Yeah, bro.
I'm a beast!
Proud of her, right?
Yes, I am.
If it was me, I'd be jealous that my sister had everything and I had nothing... but I guess you ain't that petty.
- Congratulations, y'all!
- Thank you, baby.
Y'all did it!
Derek, Derek.
Yo, I'll catch up with you.
Look, you-you want to come by tonight?
I thought you wasn't cool with my deal.
You know I don't want to make you do anything you don't feel comfortable with.
I can handle it, okay?
Okay.
Later.
♪ Yeah. ♪
Mm, my God, that wine looks so good.
Mmm, it is.
You should just have a glass.
One won't do anything.
I know, I know.
I'm just a little paranoid, especially after coming back from the hospital, you know.
Yeah.
Plus, Mom would freak.
She's obsessed.
If she had her way,
I would completely be on bed rest... which, actually, does not sound so bad because, oh, my God, my feet are killing me.
I keep hearing about some burst of energy during the second trimester.
Still waiting.
Oh...
Are you okay?
Oh.
Yeah, I just feel like this glass of wine is getting me light-headed or something.
Oh, good, good.
Drink up for the two of us.
Mom, what are you doing?
It's 3:00 in the morning.
What is all of this?
Sit down.
Where's Juanita?
I sent her away.
You know I don't like anyone else cooking in my kitchen.
You can't send her away.
She lives here.
She works for me.
Not anymore.
Sit down.
Eat it.
I'm not hungry.
I won't ask again.
I slaved for hours in that kitchen, baking these cakes for you.
And what do you do to repay me?
You leave me all by myself.
All alone.
All day.
Look, I have to work.
Everybody leaves.
First your father...
No, my father didn't leave.
He was murdered.
I saw it.
Who brought all this wickedness into our lives?
You.
I was fine until you were born.
All my troubles came with you.
Who told you to stop eating?
Well?
It's good.
Do you love me?
Liar.
If you loved me, you wouldn't have put me away for 21 years.
You were sick.
You said so yourself.
I was sick.
Now I'm sorry.
Sorry I was too weak to kill you when I had the chance.
Previously on Empire...
- Will you marry me?
- Yes.
(CROWD CHEERS)
If only Cookie knew what you did while she was away in prison.
Wouldn't be such a Sister Sledge reunion now, would it?
The Lyon family will be performing at this year's ASA awards.
Me and my son are not the only people up for this award.
I'm just saying,
I'm ready to play.
You ready to play?
I was born to play.
The board would like you to come on as co-CEOs.
I think it's a fantastic idea.
I got your back.
Hi, Grandma, it's Andre.
I wish I could have met you.
That woman's name is Leah Walker.
I believe she's your grandmother.
N-43.
It's right there.
She has a system... and the system's called cheating.
Well, I haven't noticed her cheating, so... it's okay.
I-27.
They treat you okay here?
Not Mondays.
I hate meat loaf.
She means Meatloaf Mondays, which are delicious.
Thank you.
I-29.
So, how about your family?
Does your family come visit you?
- B-7.
- MAN:
Oh!
Oh... bingo!
(GRUNTS)
That round was for the watercolor set.
Check his card!
The boy's famous now.
The boy.
Is the boy your son?
I had the voice, but they never gave me a chance.
They didn't want me to.
Your eyes.

Becky, it was good?
Keem, I'm living for it.
- It's a dope song, right?
- It's dope!
Now, look, all I got to get is this song on the Ryan Coogler movie and it instantly gets me famous.
I can't believe that this came about from Ryan hearing your stripper joint.
Worked for Lil Jon, didn't it?
- True.
- (LAUGHS) That's exactly what he's looking for, too.
Although he is a little worried about who's gonna sing the girl part.
I was thinking Tiana.
JAMAL (WHISPERING):
Tiana?
Yeah...
Tiana could work 'cause she's real hot off of her tour, but...
But what?
You don't think Laura would have a problem with that?
Nah, you overthinking it.
It's just business.
Laura totally gets it.
She gets it.
COOKIE:
So, we're gonna trace the
Lyon family sound from Lucious in the early Philly days to Jamal's new album, but I need seven minutes of stage time, not four.
Seven minutes?
- Yeah.
- You pushing it, Cookie.
Oh, that's what I do.
LUCIOUS:
No.
(LAUGHS)
Mr. D-Major.
Oh, the god of the ASAs, himself.
Oh, what's good, B?
I'm so proud of you.
I knew you had it.
I got something.
You talking about Lucious Lyon, classic monster?
This is what we're gonna do for the ASAs.
Well, actually,
I was thinking we base the Lyon Family Anthem off of one of Jamal's.
He is Empire's most nominated artist.
COOKIE:
And that is a dope idea, because I can produce a remix to the song and I can add a verse for you, and then one for Hakeem...
Wait, wait, wait, wait, you're gonna have to slow your flaps on that.
Look, I run the music on this thing.
- Hey!
- We gonna...
Hi, hi, you forgot, I'm co-CEO.
"Co" as in co-pilot, and I will call you if I need a bathroom break.
- Oh, what's wrong, Pufnstuf?
- Look, I...
You mad 'cause you been on that cleanse for a week and you ain't lost no weight, fat-ass?
Funny.
Would you like to meet Empire's most nominated artist?
He's looking at him.
No, he ain't... we talking about the present, not the past.

Shouldn't your face be up there, too, Cookie?

Hating ass.
Oh, Jamal, come here, baby!
- Hey, Ma.
- You know D-Major,
- musical director for the ASAs.
- Of course.
Congrats, man.
I'm super stoked that you're doing the ASAs.
Well, I'm stoked about the remix.
I wasn't a big fan of the single, but it's perfect for the Lyon Family Anthem.
Okay...
I'm not sure what we're talking about.
I'm doing one of my new songs.
Oh, no... your mama traded in your solo.
It's gonna be huge, Jamal.
The whole family on the stage...
Mama, no, I...
I-I can't trade in my solo.
Dude, this is the ASAs.
It's the biggest stage in the world.
Now, if you want to be on it,
I wouldn't be throwing some hissy fit.
Porsha, hold up.
Here.
You think I got time to read?
This is the Bible.
It's been handed down from assistant to assistant since the... will you take it?
God.
It tells you what to do, what not to do, who to call...
Cookie got a promotion.
That means you got a promotion now, too, so... read it cover to cover.
Thank you.
No, don't-don't thank me.
You work for a CEO now, so it's time to step your game up.
MAN:
This is the stage layout right here.
(MOUTHS)
Check on those...
Hey, Hakeem.
Hakeem!
(WHOOPS) Yeah.
- Got a verse for me?
- Mom,
I'm not singing backup for Lucious at the ASAs.
I got my own thing I'm working on.
Boy, it's not backup... and you can chew gum and walk at the same time, can't you?
Look... rehearsal at Laviticus, don't be late.
All right.
Yeah, all right.
CANDACE:
Nice place, Loretha.
What'd I tell you about calling me by my government name?
Look, whatever it is you came for,
Candace, we ain't got time.
Hey, is something wrong with my kids?
Yes.
They're not with their mother, and it's time they should be.
Look, Candace, please don't start all of that.
You know she just got out of rehab.
She needs to focus.
Just because you weren't around to raise your kids doesn't mean we're gonna follow your example, Cookie.
When the winter break is over, the kids are coming here.
Hey, wait a minute.
You know I only have a two-bedroom apartment.
then I suggest you invest in some bunk beds.
I'm serious, Carol.
You know what... you need to talk to your sister before I kick her ass.
Candace.

You need not to grab me, dude.
Everybody out.
Now!
- Wink, shut the door.
- Yeah, man.
Look, all I'm saying is that...
Yeah, man, I get it, you're a visionary artist, but I got a hundred artists that I have to juggle, plus produce the show, so if you're not happy, I suggest you go
talk to your mother.
I'm not talking to my mother, I'm talking to you.

Yeah.

I can't see Ryan Coogler not putting this on the soundtrack.
Soundtrack?
I definitely want that on my next album.
It's 1:00?
I thought it was 10:00.
Laura gonna kill me.
Wow... the Hakeem
I knew would want to go to the club right now... but I guess you can't, huh?
Since you got a wifey... and a baby mama.
What, you got jokes?
(LAUGHING):
I'm just...
Look, I can go to the club if I want, but Cookie got me focusing on this ASA thing, so...
Well, we're definitely gonna miss you.
COOKIE:
Okay, I need you to put that on table 7, those go on table...
You know, according to the Empire HR bible, setting out tables and stuff is not the job of the CEO assistants.
- Oh, really?
- Mm-hmm.
Would you like a demotion?
I can arrange that.
I'll do it today.
Yeah, I know you will.
Sure.
Rough night?
Yeah.
But I ain't complaining, fool.
(CHUCKLES)
Gots to love it.
I don't know who ordered all this stuff, but I want it all 86ed out of here.
Yo, what's that green mess, anyway?
Dad's on a fast for the ASAs, 'cause Mom let him know that TV puts ten pounds on you.
No, he's doing it for his health.
Um, so I got a rough script.
Andre's gonna start with some narration to set up the scene;
he should be here in a minute.
(LUCIOUS PLAYING PIANO)
Dad, that's not it.
You don't think that sounds played out?
It honestly sounds like you're trying to make my song sound like your old song.
Well, if it sounds played out, it means you wrote a played out song.
I wrote a played out song?
- I'm trying to fix...
- No, you don't want to change it
- and you sound...
- Listen, I'm not down with all of this R B back and forth.
Mom, where's my verse supposed to be?
- Okay, pause.
- I'm supposed to sing on the bridge?
Pause!
I'm running this.
I got this, and of course we're gonna find somewhere for your verse, Hakeem... and Lucious, your verse can be a flip on Jamal's, and Jamal, it's your song.
JAMAL:
Thank you, Mom, thank you.
- See, it's my song.
- You know what?
This ain't working.
I want to go back to my original plan.
JAMAL:
What original plan, Dad?
Where we do the song where you accuse us of biting the hand that never really fed us?
- Oh, you didn't eat?
- Nah, he talking about the song
- that he wrote back when - (COOKIE SIGHING) he thought Mom was snitch bitch.
(DISCORDANT PIANO NOTE)
Now, y'all sound like a rack of bitches, okay?
Lucious can sit up here and take y'all's jaw jacking, but I'm not 'cause I'm running this show.
- Excuse me?
- Yeah, excuse me.
I busted my ass to finally get here and I'll be damned if I let y'all mess it up.
So put your big girl drawers on, 'cause we gonna come together and do this as a family.
Does anybody here know what that means?
ANDRE:
That's an intriguing question... and I have someone here with me that might have a point of view.
It's okay, Grandma.
This is your family.
COOKIE:
Lucious...
JAMAL:
Whose grandmother?
What do you mean Grandma?
Who is this lady?
Lucious.
Dwight?
Andre, what's going on?
This is Leah Walker...
Lucious' mother.
Andre, our grandmother's dead.

ANDRE:
What, you got nothing to say?
You want to tell them about how you... sent her away to a home for 21 years, never looked back?
Or how about how you sent Vernon out there once a month to pay out hush money to anybody who knew who she really was... how about that one, huh?
Dad, what?
Yeah, that's not true.
It's not.
No, Harper Scott gave me her files.
Can't lie your way out of this one, Pop.

You have no... idea what you've done.
I can't believe that just happened.
Yeah, it's deeper than we think, too.

- (PHONE BEEPING)
- Here to check out your rehearsal.
Hey, yo, Laura blowing me up.
- Meet you up, bro.
- All right.
Baby...
Yo.
Yo, you might not want to go back there;
Lucious and Cookie are trying to figure
- some things out.
- Yeah, well, maybe I can help.
No, no, it's family stuff.
Besides, you really expect me to believe that you only came for rehearsal?
Yeah, that's my job, but if I'm not needed, then I'm out.
COOKIE:
Lucious...
Yeah, baby?
Why did you lie?
I didn't lie about anything.
Then what was that video about?
(SIGHS)
The truth.
My mother did try and drown me.
She did put a gun to her head and pulled the trigger, and told an eight-year-old boy that it was his fault she was the way she is.
Just turns out there was no bullets in the gun.
Well, if she didn't die then...
No... my mother died the day that they locked her up.
And then remember how under Reagan the government took all the mentally ill patients and dumped them out on the street?
Well, one day in front of 30th Street Station,
I damn near tripped over her.
Now you and me, we were on welfare and had two and a half kids, we couldn't take care of her if we wanted to.
You just... you could have at least told me about her, Lucious.
(WHISPERING):
I couldn't.
I needed her to stay dead.
That's why I took Andre to the grave.
He just wouldn't leave it alone, you know.
But he just doesn't understand.
I mean, none of y'all understand how... dangerous she really is.
- Why didn't you tell me?
- How did you even find out?
What, you were snooping through my computer?
It doesn't matter how I found out.
What matters is, Tiana's doing a duet with you on a song you yourself told me would go platinum.
The producers wanted her.
It was out of my control, babe.
You could have pushed for me.
I bet you never even brought me up.
Baby...
I love you.
Okay?
You know that.
But you can't automatically think you're gonna be on all my duets.
Trust me, there'll be other opportunities.
I trust you.
I just don't trust Tiana.
She's still feeling you.
So what if she is?
I want you.
♪ ♪
ANDRE:
I don't trust him, okay?
I think she needs to stay with us until we find a permanent situation.
No, Andre, we're staying in a hotel.
- We can get her an adjoining room, babe.
- Oh...
I think we should at least talk to her caregivers.
I mean, do you even know who her doctors are?
Great.

You think she's like you.
She's a completely different kind of person.

You don't know, you don't know about it.

We're gonna go home, okay?

I want to go home...
Yeah, we're going home, we're going home.
...with my Dwight.
Dwight...
I want to go to bed now.
I'll have the nurse take you to your room.
Juanita.
Yes, sir.
I want you to make sure she takes each and every one of her pills.
Watch her put them in her mouth.
Check to make sure she swallowed them.
Remove the phone out of her room, and nobody comes to see her without my permission.
And no matter what, you don't take your eyes off of her, okay?

Rhonda, thank you.
Thank you for all this amazing stuff and... you and Andre, y-you're so generous.
Honestly, you did not have to do this.
It's nothing, really.
I feel like... if... when we try again, I...
I just... want a fresh start.
I don't want to be reminded...
- Watch out!

Hell!

Yeah.

Wait, wait, hold on, hold on... (HYPERVENTILATING)

Hey, thanks for letting me stay here.
Yeah.

Hey, come on.
I shouldn't be here.
I'm not gonna pretend like I'm sorry about the other night.
But I do know you're seeing someone, so I don't wanna screw things up for you.
That's not what I'm talking about.
What are you talking about, then?
You lied to me.
Alec Moros wasn't in this house that night.
- Yes, he was.
- Meg, he was in New York.
No, that's not true.
I spoke to him.
He was in New York.
I mean, well, maybe I got the nights confused.
Hmm.
Hear me out.
Don't speak, and hear me out.
Sure.
You lied to me... and I think John lied to me, too, and maybe you're protecting your brother.
Now, that's not a very smart thing for you to be doing right now.
I'm...
I probably got the nights confused, Marco, but I didn't lie to you.
Meg.
I'm giving you a chance to get out in front of it, whatever it is, before it's too late.
And come in and talk to me again.
Please.
I don't know anything, Marco.
Be careful.
I know John's family, but you need to look out for yourself.
Mom, you have to keep track of these.
It's too fucking complicated.
I laid them out for you.
Where's your pill schedule?
What?
The sheet I gave her.
The laminated one.
- I don't know.
- Jesus Christ, Eric.
You gotta help me out with this.
- She can't keep half the pills down.
- I toss that shit right up.
Well, I can give you something for nausea.
What I need is groceries.
Lemon Cremes and the Fudgies with the little stripes.
What's that?
It's called "Heavenly Protection."
I can't fucking believe this.
You can't afford to keep buying this crap.
On TV, they said there were only 43 left, and they knocked the price way down.
Put it on the shelf.
No.
We're returning it.
Now, this pill, this one you take twice a day.
Once in the morning and once at night.
This one you take three times a day.
And this blue one... only take when you need it.
For constipation.
- Who is it?
- Monroe County Sheriff's Department.
What do you want?
I'm sorry to bother you at home.
Can I have a word with you?
What happened with you and Marco?
Meg, we have to assume that Marco is no longer a friend of ours.
This isn't just Aguirre's bullshit anymore.
'Cause Marco, he's...
He's trying to make a case against us, Meg.
He knows I lied.
He says you lied to him, too.
- He has no way of knowing that, Meg.
- Then why would he say it?
Because he doesn't have anything.
That's why he brought you in.
Let me guess.
He brings you in, asks you a bunch of questions, and then he tries to turn you against me.
Basically, yeah.
The only way that he can get anything on us... is if he turns us against each other.
Short of that, he's just gonna keep looking for every angle he can.
There's something that you don't know.
The information about Aguirre and his wife...
I released that.
Why are you telling me this now?
Because there's more to the story.
Marco was the responding officer.
He never filed an incident report.
And three weeks later, the sheriff's department hired him.
You realize that Internal Affairs will have a field day with that.
That Marco and Aguirre will be waist-high in shit.
And they won't even have time to wipe their asses, Meg.
I just can't do it, John.
I can't do that to him.
He's never ever done one thing to hurt me.
How close is he?
I don't know.
The other day, you said something.
Something that I gotta get clear on.
You told me to look into the Rayburn family.
Why did you tell me that?
Ask John.
Why?
He was the last person to see Danny alive.
Why just John?
The whole family saw him together.
When?
Night of the Red Reef, Danny went to the inn.
- Whole family was there...
- I'm not talking about that, dude.
- Then what are you talking about?
- I'm talking about...
I'm talking about the next morning.
The next morning, John didn't see anybody.
He had a heart attack at his house.
I mean...
- That's what he's saying?
- Yeah.
He was working his lawn, he had a heart attack, he called Meg, Meg took him to the hospital.
He's lying.
He met with Danny.
How do you know?
I know.
Dude...
I know shit.
Some shit that I have not... fucking told anyone.
What shit do you know?
Uh-uh.
I need protection.
I tell my story, I want full fucking immunity.
Immunity from what?
Everything.
Anything.
'Cause I talk, God knows what you motherfuckers gonna try to pop on me.
Well, then I need more.
John saw Danny?
Where?
When?
Immunity... or I don't fucking say shit.
Prove to me that you know something.
Go ask John's daughter about the necklace that Danny gave her.
What necklace?
Just ask her.
So, what you're saying is you wanna take a look at our security feed.
We just wanna see how far back the footage goes for the traffic along this stretch of road.
It's the only access to the beach.
Uh-huh.
And my tax dollars are going towards you coming here and hassling me over my private personal property?
What you'd be doing is helping Monroe County Sheriff Department in a number of investigations, ongoing.
Well, that doesn't answer my question.
Yes, your tax dollars do pay my salary.
I'm very grateful for that.
I assume you have some sort of a signed warrant.
You know, maybe there's a misunderstanding here.
I have no interest at all about your property.
I only want to know about the traffic that moves along this road.
That's it.
That's what the feds told Sheldon Burkes over at Magnolia Farms two years ago.

What?
Nolan.
I just couldn't stand him here anymore.
He showed up... after Danny was gone, and no one even knew he existed until then?
Nope.
Now, what does that mean to you?
Nothing.
Should I be worried about him?
You said you didn't wanna talk about this.
Let's not talk about this.
I wanna know.
Should I be worried about him?
No.
Hank.
Hey.

Listen, I was over at the Cardozo Farms the other day.
I'm surprised that bastard let you on his property, given you're an agent of the government and all.
No, that's what...
He didn't let me on, but I'd like to get on.
What for?
Well, you know, it's an investigation.
What do you need?
I'd like to look at the security system over there.
Like, as in the cameras?
That's right.
You can't get a warrant?
There's nothing you can do?
They keep everything on servers these days.
I don't have the resources.
What, are you fucking telling me you can't?
I can't.
All right.
Well... enjoy my fucking cigars.
- Hey, John.
- Yeah?
I might know a guy who's into that kind of thing.
- Can you trust him?
- Absolutely.
He owes me a couple favors, too.
What do you need?

I wanna know what's on those cameras over the past six months.

- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Your dad's fine.
I just need to ask you a couple questions.
About what?
Danny.
Okay.
The day that Danny went missing, you, your mom, your brother, you guys were out of town,
- right?
- Right.
And that was right after you and Danny went out on the boat?
Uh-huh.
That day he mentioned something about a necklace.
Oh, yeah.
Uncle Danny gave me some necklace as, like, a present.
My dad didn't like it.
Is that it?
This?
Oh, no.
It was a seahorse.
- A seahorse.
- Yeah.
I was just looking for it the other day.
You know where it is?
Nope.
I don't know.
My dad took it from me, like, when I first got it.
And I asked him about it the other day, but...
- But what?
- He said he lost it.
- What does it matter anyway, though?
- Actually, it doesn't matter.
I'm just tying up loose ends.
Boring cop shit.
Okay.
Well, remind me not to become a boring cop.
I will.
Bye, Janey.
See you.
- Hey, Mom.
- Hi, honey.
Was that Marco you were talking to?
Yeah, it was.
What did he want?
Oh, he just wanted to ask me some questions.
Wait, wait...
What did...?
What did he ask her about?
I couldn't exactly grill Janey for details, but he wanted to know about the necklace.
What about the necklace?
He asked her where it was.
John?
What's going on?
I don't know.
I...
What the fuck do you mean, you don't know?
You told me we were safe.
We were.
And now?
Jesus, John.
Talk to me.
Listen to me.
I'll take care of this, all right?
Yeah.
Yeah, you will.
Diana, there is nothing in the world that means more to me than you and the kids.
What do we got?
O'Bannon says John's lying about the last time he saw Danny.
- About what?
The Red Reef?
- I don't know.
Don't get too excited.
We're talking about O'Bannon here, and he may be full of shit.
So, bring him in.
He says he won't come in unless we give him immunity.
If he wants immunity, he better tell us a good fucking story.
He says he has one, and he says he can prove it.
Can he?
He may...
He may know something.

I need it back.
It's important.
Well...
I'm sure you'd be willing to part with whatever you got in that sack.
Heavenly Protection.
Hummel?
Well...
Fuck me, O'Bannon.
We got a deal.
Worth maybe half a Hummel.
O'Bannon, you, my friend, are a crack negotiator.
You come back and see me anytime, huh?
Hey.
Yeah?
You go to my daughter's school, and out in the parking lot, you ask her fucking questions?
The last thing I wanted to do was drag Janey in here and ask her questions in front of everybody, and turn this whole thing into something that it wasn't, okay?
She's 16.
You're right, John.
I should've reached out to you first.
I'm sorry.

Contracts my lawyers drew up.
All they need is your brother's signature.
Oh, thank you.
I will look at these.
Any more nuisance suits you needed to settle?
Yes.
About that, I have...
Mezcal, two.
- Sure.
- I'm sorry.
You were saying...
The problem has been taken care of.
It's just that there is a campaign deficit involved.
I see.
You've been more than generous, obviously.
Have you sent my office an invoice for the legal work you did for me?
Excuse me?
The legal consulting you did.
- I didn't...
- For your brother's boatyard.
Have you billed my office yet?
Mr. Gilbert, it's a considerable amount of money.
Well, you've earned it.
We have you on retainer, isn't that right?
Mr. Gilbert, I'm not comfortable with that.
Nonsense.
You've done such fine work.
Send the bill as soon as possible.
- Better to wrap up these things quickly.
- Here you go.
You'll learn with a little creative thinking, you can accomplish anything you want.
God, I hate fucking fishing.
My girl's gone.
What does that mean?
It means she's gone.
She's not calling me back.
I don't know what the fuck to do, man.
I'm sorry, dude.
That sucks.
Maybe I should just get the fuck out of here.
Go back to Miami, track her ass down.
You still working on that thing you said you were working on down here?
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
There you go.
Grade A Rayburn cash, as promised.
Holy fuck.
You got this from them?
I can get a lot more.
'Cause not only are these people fucking amateurs, they got a guilty fucking conscience.
As well they fucking should.
John...
Detective fucking John Rayburn, he lied to the cops.
Well, how do you know?
I know.
And if I tell the cops, then they'll clear me from all the shit that happened at the Red Reef.
You're talking to the cops?
- They came to me.
- Oh, come on.
- What?
- Come on, man.
This is our golden opportunity, man.
This is our golden ticket, bro.
You don't have a murder beef hanging over you, do you?
I'd love to see John Rayburn exposed
- as the fraud that he is.
- Shut the fuck up.
What is this?
- I think it's my cut.
- No.
This is nothing.
That's shit, okay?
- It's gonna get fucking wet.
- Leave it there.
- It's gonna get wet on the fucking...
- Leave it.
You don't deserve that shit.
This is nothing compared to what we could really have, you dipshit.
You understand?
Yeah, I fucking understand, but I got a situation I gotta deal with.
You got a sit...?
Fuck your situation, okay?
You know for a fact that John lied to the cops?
Yeah.
You got proof?
I can prove it, yeah.
Well, then... you don't go to the cops.
You don't bite the tit that feeds you, you hear me?
'Cause we own this motherfucker.
- Yeah?
- You at a computer?
Yeah.
You're gonna get a secure link and a password.
It'll be good for 24 hours.
It should get you what you need.
Hey, Hank?
- Thank you.
- Yep.
You okay?
Hi.
Yeah.
I'm fine.
Have you seen Marco?
Why would you ask me that?
Well, whenever you used to have a problem with a boy...
I'd find you out here.
Mom, that was in high school.
Yeah, I guess so.
Hi, Meg!
What is she doing here?
She's staying here with Nolan.
For how long?
As long as they want.
Was that why you invited me here?
Yeah.
I thought you all should know.
Maybe you can... tell John and Kevin.
Uh...
Okay.
Yeah.
How is Kevin anyway?
He's going to meetings.
He's good.
And he just got Roy Gilbert to invest in the boatyard so now he's doing good financially, too.
Mom?
I do not like that man.
I thought he was a friend of Dad's.
Your father and Roy Gilbert were not friends.
Did something happen that I should know about?
What you should know is that Roy Gilbert wants what's best for Roy Gilbert, and that's all he wants.
And he'll do whatever it takes to get it.
Hey, I wanna show you something.
Come with me.
All right.
I don't know, Kev.
- Why, is something wrong with the terms?
- No.
The terms are fine.
It's...
Do you realize that you're gonna give up control to Gilbert?
The other guy wanted to bend me over and kick me out.
It's a hell of a lot better than that, isn't it?
Maybe just... think it over some more.
Give me some time to do some due diligence on Gilbert.
I don't have any more time.
What's going on?
You're the one who hooked me up with this guy in the first place.
- You know the guy that I paid off?
- Yeah.
Gilbert is the one that gave me the money.
I just don't know if that is the kind of guy you should be doing business with.
Meg, if I fuck this up, if I lose this...
I'm telling you, I'm gonna end up selling fucking drills down at Harry's Hardware.
- No, you're not.
- Yes, Meg, I am.
And how come when you and John need money for the campaign, there's not a problem?
Suddenly, I'm in trouble, and now you're concerned?
- I'm trying to help you.
- Are you trying to help me?
Because I need this to happen.
I don't want this.
I need this.
- I get it.
- I don't think you do.
You know what?
I think I'm starting to realize something.
Now that Danny's gone, and I'm starting to sober up, get my shit together a little bit, I think you're scared.
About what?
There might not be a fuck-up in the family anymore for you and John to feel superior to.
Are you kidding me right now?
- Number one, I am not John.
- Well...
Number two, it's a fucked-up thing to say.
You're gonna have to go find somebody else to save.
Just make sure that they're a real failure so that you can come in and rescue them.
I'm not having this conversation with you.
If you wanna do this, Kevin, you go ahead and do it.
The paperwork is fine.
Okay.
Well, thank you for your legal advice, but if I need any more, I'll be sure to look elsewhere.

Your mama has a very pretty voice.
I guess.
He just hates it when I sing.
How could you hate that?
He used to like it.
He wanted me to sing all the time when he was a little boy.
Yeah, okay.
I'm going to bed.
- You're leaving?
Just like that?
- Yep.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Robert used to sing that song for the kids, all the time.
Yeah, I know.
Danny told me.
That's why I learned it.
And Danny used to sing it to Nolan when he was a baby.
Danny couldn't sing.
Yeah, but he did it anyway.
Miss Ortiz, thank you very much for seeing me again.
I'm glad you called.
I think it's very important that we get your story out there.
Please, come in.
Clay, what was that all about?
You didn't hear?
Reporters got some dirt on Diaz and IA is following up.
It's our responsibility to inform you we're opening up an investigation.
Since when does IA take orders from the local paper?
A report like this has to be looked into.
You understand.
It's a serious allegation.
Do you understand that that's all that this is?
It's just an allegation.
You'll get a chance to explain your side of the story, Detective.
If there's been no misconduct... you have nothing to worry about.
No.
No.
No, no.
I don't care if it's Barbara fucking Walters, the answer's gonna be the same.
I'm not available for comment.
There's gonna be an official inquiry.
Shit.
Rayburn.
Probably.
All right, first thing:
don't say a word to anyone.
And call the union lawyer.
It's only gonna be a matter of days before they start sticking microscopes up our ass.
What about the case?
Full steam ahead.
Tell O'Bannon he's got immunity.
- DA's gonna need more than that.
- Draw up the paperwork.
If O'Bannon's got the goods, I wanna be ready to roll.
Listen, O'Bannon.
I haven't heard back from you.
I think you're full of shit.
You want immunity, you gotta give me something before you run out of time.
You know the number.
I'm waiting for your call, okay?
You want immunity, you gotta give me something before you run out of time.
You know the number.
I'm waiting for your call, okay?
You know, you better split.
He's gonna be here soon.
I'll get finished here with John, and I'll swing by your place.
See you, man.
Good luck, bro.
Danny.
Danny.
Dan-o.
- Oh, hey, Mr. Gilbert.
- Hey,
I thought I'd stop by and check out my investment.
Uh...
Okay.
If I still have an investment.
Meg said she left the papers with you.
- Yeah.
Sorry about that.
I got...
- Have you signed?
We got a deal?
- I can give you another day or two.
- No, no.
No, I got them right here.
- Uh-huh.
Everything check out?
- Yeah.
- No questions?
Issues?
- No.
No, not really.
"Not really"?
Is that the sound of second thoughts I hear?
Yeah.
Just...
Just me and you here, Kevin.
No need beating around the buttonwood.
If you need more time to go over it...
No, no.
I don't need any more time.
Oh.
Okay, then.
Yep.
Got anything to drink around here to toast our new partnership?
Uh, actually, I don't drink, but I have a large assortment of juices and sodas if...
Well, we'll skip it, then.
We'll celebrate another time.
- I'll take you and the wife out to dinner.
- Sounds good.
- Yeah.
You'll hear from me soon.
- Okay.
Thank you.
Thanks for coming down.
- Oh, hey.
- Hm.
Hey.
Where the hell you been, huh?
I was starting to think that you'd forgotten all about me.
I got a little surprise for you.
- Yeah?
- Oh, yeah.
Holy shit.
How much is this?
I got a lot more back at the motel, so why don't you say we go back, you and me, and roll in it?
I can't.
Why not?
She invited me to stay.
"She" who?
Sally Rayburn.
So, uh... me and Nolan are at the inn now.
Like...
Like you're living there?
I don't know.
We'll see.
What happened?
Uh, I think she realized she made a mistake shutting me out, you know... and she's got a hole in her life without Danny.
Hm.
Wow, you really worked that situation, didn't you?
I didn't work anything.
They're my family.
Yeah, but...
But they're not.
So, let me come and see it.
Let me come and check your situation.
I can't screw this up.
Hey.
This thing between you and me wasn't gonna last forever.
You knew that.
Yeah.
Did I?
It's crazy 'cause I'm the only one who's ever really taken care of you.
I mean, your parents didn't.
Right?
Danny didn't.
And these people aren't gonna either.
It's just me.
Just me, really.
I just don't think it's a good idea for them to be living here.
Well, you seemed okay with it earlier.
You sprung it on me, Mom.
I didn't get time to think about it.
Nolan's my grandson, your nephew.
It's a non-issue.
Okay, but what about her, then?
Mom, she came here begging us for money.
She's using you.
I appreciate that you're trying to fix things that happened in the past, but it's just not the right way to do it.
Well, it's my way of doing it.
She's not who you think she is.
Who is she?
You don't know what she does or who she associates with.
Who?
Who does she associate with?
I can't tell you that right now, Mom.
God, you sound like your brother John, telling me things without telling me anything.
I just don't want her to be around this place, okay?
- Well, it's not your decision.
- Well, it should be, Mom.
- Oh, it should?
- Yeah.
John and Kevin and I, we all own part of this place, too.
If you're gonna make a decision like that, you should ask us.
Did you and John and Kevin build this from nothing?
Did you raise five children while trying to run a business, Meg?
Did you almost have a fucking nervous breakdown trying to make everybody else happy but yourself?
Mom...
Did you?
No.
Then don't talk to me about your rights here.
I asked you to cut Danny back into the business before he died.
You didn't do it, did you?
No.
Mom, I don't know what she's up to, but it's not good.
Nolan and Eve are not going anywhere.
Hey, man.
Good to see you.
Do you really think that IA bullshit's gonna scare me off?
I don't know what to think.
I know what you did.
And you know what you did.
Good night, Marco.
You know, if you keep going down this road... you're not gonna find what you think.
It's not gonna end well for you.
Well, then, it looks like it's not gonna end well for either of us.
What's going on here?
What are you guys doing on the boat?
You must be Kevin.
My apologies.
Didn't expect you to be here this late.
Uh...
Who the fuck are you?
I'm Luis, an old friend of Mr. Gilbert's.
- Is there a problem, Luis?
- No, not at all.
We just needed to take the boat out for a bit.
Nothing to worry about.
Does Mr. Gilbert know about this?
Of course.
It's good to meet you.
Look forward to seeing more of each other.
How can we work this out?
I don't know, John.
John?
What happened?
Oh, my God.
Is that Danny?
I'm gonna take John's car to the hospital.
Take Danny and go home.
I wanna tell my story.

I'm leaving.
After I graduate, I'm...
I'm out of here.
If I stay... nothing's gonna change.
I'm always gonna be what they think I am.
You should leave, too.
Me?
You gotta be careful, John.
We can never be what we want if we stay here.
Where are you gonna go?
It doesn't matter.
Just gonna get in Dad's old truck and... just drive.
Hi.
What's going on?
I'm taking him.
It's time he came with me, you know?
Hey, thanks for letting me stay here.
Yeah.
You take care of yourself.
[♪♪♪]
[Eve] Hey, come on.
I shouldn't be here.
I'm not gonna pretend like I'm sorry about the other night.
But I do know you're seeing someone, so I don't wanna screw things up for you.
That's not what I'm talking about.
What are you talking about, then?
You lied to me.
Alec Moros wasn't in this house that night.
- Yes, he was.
- Meg, he was in New York.
No, that's not true.
I spoke to him.
He was in New York.
I mean, well, maybe I got the nights confused.
Hmm.
Hear me out.
Don't speak, and hear me out.
Sure.
You lied to me... and I think John lied to me, too, and maybe you're protecting your brother.
Now, that's not a very smart thing for you to be doing right now.
I'm...
I probably got the nights confused, Marco, but I didn't lie to you.
Meg.
I'm giving you a chance to get out in front of it, whatever it is, before it's too late.
[♪♪♪]
And come in and talk to me again.
Please.
I don't know anything, Marco.
Be careful.
I know John's family, but you need to look out for yourself.
[door opens] [door closes]
[Chelsea] Mom, you have to keep track of these.
[Mrs. O'Bannon] It's too fucking complicated.
I laid them out for you.
Where's your pill schedule?
What?
The sheet I gave her.
The laminated one.
[TV playing indistinctly]
- I don't know.
- Jesus Christ, Eric.
You gotta help me out with this.
- She can't keep half the pills down.
- I toss that shit right up.
Well, I can give you something for nausea.
What I need is groceries.
Lemon Cremes and the Fudgies with the little stripes.
What's that?
[Mrs. O'Bannon] It's called "Heavenly Protection."
I can't fucking believe this.
You can't afford to keep buying this crap.
On TV, they said there were only 43 left, and they knocked the price way down.
Put it on the shelf.
No.
We're returning it.
Now, this pill, this one you take twice a day.
Once in the morning and once at night.
This one you take three times a day.
And this blue one... only take when you need it.
For constipation.
[knock on door]
- Who is it?
- [man] Monroe County Sheriff's Department.
[sighs]
[Eric] What do you want?
I'm sorry to bother you at home.
Can I have a word with you?
What happened with you and Marco?
Meg, we have to assume that Marco is no longer a friend of ours.
This isn't just Aguirre's bullshit anymore.
'Cause Marco, he's...
He's trying to make a case against us, Meg.
He knows I lied.
He says you lied to him, too.
- He has no way of knowing that, Meg.
- Then why would he say it?
Because he doesn't have anything.
That's why he brought you in.
Let me guess.
He brings you in, asks you a bunch of questions, and then he tries to turn you against me.
Basically, yeah.
The only way that he can get anything on us... is if he turns us against each other.
Short of that, he's just gonna keep looking for every angle he can.
There's something that you don't know.
The information about Aguirre and his wife...
I released that.
Why are you telling me this now?
Because there's more to the story.
Marco was the responding officer.
He never filed an incident report.
And three weeks later, the sheriff's department hired him.
You realize that Internal Affairs will have a field day with that.
That Marco and Aguirre will be waist-high in shit.
And they won't even have time to wipe their asses, Meg.
I just can't do it, John.
I can't do that to him.
He's never ever done one thing to hurt me.
How close is he?
I don't know.
The other day, you said something.
Something that I gotta get clear on.
You told me to look into the Rayburn family.
Why did you tell me that?
Ask John.
Why?
He was the last person to see Danny alive.
Why just John?
The whole family saw him together.
When?
Night of the Red Reef, Danny went to the inn.
- Whole family was there...
- I'm not talking about that, dude.
- Then what are you talking about?
- I'm talking about...
I'm talking about the next morning.
The next morning, John didn't see anybody.
He had a heart attack at his house.
I mean...
- That's what he's saying?
- Yeah.
He was working his lawn, he had a heart attack, he called Meg, Meg took him to the hospital.
He's lying.
[♪♪♪]
He met with Danny.
How do you know?
I know.
[Eric scoffs]
Dude...
I know shit.
Some shit that I have not... fucking told anyone.
What shit do you know?
Uh-uh.
I need protection.
I tell my story, I want full fucking immunity.
Immunity from what?
Everything.
Anything.
'Cause I talk, God knows what you motherfuckers gonna try to pop on me.
Well, then I need more.
John saw Danny?
Where?
When?
Immunity... or I don't fucking say shit.
Prove to me that you know something.
Go ask John's daughter about the necklace that Danny gave her.
What necklace?
Just ask her.
[camera whirring] [gate squeaking, then clangs]
So, what you're saying is you wanna take a look at our security feed.
We just wanna see how far back the footage goes for the traffic along this stretch of road.
It's the only access to the beach.
Uh-huh.
And my tax dollars are going towards you coming here and hassling me over my private personal property?
What you'd be doing is helping Monroe County Sheriff Department in a number of investigations, ongoing.
Well, that doesn't answer my question.
Yes, your tax dollars do pay my salary.
I'm very grateful for that.
I assume you have some sort of a signed warrant.
You know, maybe there's a misunderstanding here.
I have no interest at all about your property.
I only want to know about the traffic that moves along this road.
That's it.
That's what the feds told Sheldon Burkes over at Magnolia Farms two years ago.
[John chuckles]
Listen, it's just this...
It's just this stretch of road.
Why don't we reopen this once we get that warrant?
Have a good day.
Yeah.
You, too, you son of a bitch.
[Ozzy] Baby.
Hey, babe?
Babe, check this out.
Look what I got.
[playing]
Oh, man.
[clicks tongue]
[line ringing]
[Eve on recording] Hey, leave a message.
Hey, luscious.
Where you at?
I just drove all the way to Miami, and I got you something.
Oh, yeah.
I can't wait to see your face when you see the...
When you...
When you, um...
Um...
Baby, um, where you at, huh?
Do, um...?
I mean, your shit...
Your shit's not here.
Where the fuck you at?
You wanna call me back and tell me what the fuck is going on?
Huh?
Okay.
Bye.
[Sally] The shower's been leaking for a year, and I can't seem to get anybody to fix it.
- Do we get maid service?
- [Sally chuckles]
[Sally] Paying guests get maid service.
Yeah.
We don't need any of that.
I'm happy to have you.
But while you're here, I expect you to help out.
Doing what?
- Whatever Sally wants.
- Well, we'll find something.
There's no end to the things that need to get done around here.
Yeah.
It'll be nice to be useful.
Just whatever you need.
This was always a family place.
Hasn't seemed much like that lately, but, um... maybe you two can change that.
Let's, uh...
Let's go in, and I'll show you the space.
I'm going over to Paul's.
Hm.
Are you still working on that assignment?
Yeah.
It's due tomorrow.
- Good luck with it, honey.
- [Ben] Bye, guys.
Have a good night.
[Diana] I downloaded that app.
Seriously, I hate you.
Why?
It's fun.
I can't stop playing it.
I don't know how you get anything done.
It's called multi-tasking, Mom.
Mm.
Yeah.
I should try that sometime.
I'm glad he's gone.
What?
Nolan.
I just couldn't stand him here anymore.
He showed up... after Danny was gone, and no one even knew he existed until then?
Nope.
Now, what does that mean to you?
Nothing.
[scoffs]
Should I be worried about him?
You said you didn't wanna talk about this.
Let's not talk about this.
I wanna know.
Should I be worried about him?
No.
[♪♪♪]
[indistinct voices over radio]
[John] Hank.
[Hank] Hey.
Whiskey and cigars?
You must be in quite a jam.
Well, I like you.
Yeah, I doubt that.
Forget about this.
Let's say you hook me up with that sister of yours.
You realize I got a gun on my hip, don't you?
Listen, I was over at the Cardozo Farms the other day.
I'm surprised that bastard let you on his property, given you're an agent of the government and all.
No, that's what...
He didn't let me on, but I'd like to get on.
What for?
Well, you know, it's an investigation.
[exhales sharply] What do you need?
I'd like to look at the security system over there.
Like, as in the cameras?
That's right.
You can't get a warrant?
There's nothing you can do?
They keep everything on servers these days.
I don't have the resources.
What, are you fucking telling me you can't?
I can't.
All right.
Well... enjoy my fucking cigars.
- [Hank] Hey, John.
- Yeah?
I might know a guy who's into that kind of thing.
- Can you trust him?
- Absolutely.
He owes me a couple favors, too.
What do you need?
On the north gate, there are two cameras.
I wanna know what's on those cameras over the past six months.
I'll call my guy.
I can't make any promises, but... when he gets back to me, you'll be the first to know.
I appreciate that.
[Hank] See you, buddy.
[engine rumbling]
Shit.
- [Roy] Hello there, sir.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Hope I'm not overstepping.
- No.
Wanted a place to park this sucker for a week or so.
Hey, trust me, you buy this place, you got all the docking space you need.
- Oh, I like the sound of that.
- [laughs]
- Hey, come on.
Let me get you a coffee.
- Yeah, sure.
- [sighs]
- So?
My offer.
Now, that's contingent upon you sticking around.
You want me to stay?
Absolutely.
You know the place, you know the clientele.
I want you in charge of all operations.
- There a problem?
- No.
Uh...
Wow.
Um...
Thank you.
I'm just not used to people having faith in me, that's all.
- Oh...
- I appreciate this.
Oh, it's a gift to get to do the thing you love.
- Brings out the best in people.
Mm.
- Yes, sir.
So, that number work for you?
- Yeah.
That's gonna work.
- [chuckles]
- That's gonna work just fine.
- Beautiful.
I'll draw up the paperwork, get it to your sister.
Thank you.
- Oh, yeah.
- Thank you, Mr. Gilbert.
Yeah.
[sighs]
Janey.
- Is my dad okay?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- What are you doing here?
- Relax.
Your dad's fine.
I just need to ask you a couple questions.
About what?
Danny.
Okay.
The day that Danny went missing, you, your mom, your brother, you guys were out of town,
- right?
- Right.
And that was right after you and Danny went out on the boat?
Uh-huh.
That day he mentioned something about a necklace.
Oh, yeah.
Uncle Danny gave me some necklace as, like, a present.
My dad didn't like it.
Is that it?
This?
Oh, no.
It was a seahorse.
- A seahorse.
- Yeah.
I was just looking for it the other day.
You know where it is?
Nope.
I don't know.
My dad took it from me, like, when I first got it.
And I asked him about it the other day, but...
- But what?
- He said he lost it.
- What does it matter anyway, though?
- Actually, it doesn't matter.
I'm just tying up loose ends.
Boring cop shit. [chuckles]
Okay.
Well, remind me not to become a boring cop.
I will.
Bye, Janey.
[Janey] See you.
- Hey, Mom.
- Hi, honey.
Was that Marco you were talking to?
Yeah, it was.
What did he want?
Oh, he just wanted to ask me some questions.
[♪♪♪]
Wait, wait...
What did...?
What did he ask her about?
I couldn't exactly grill Janey for details, but he wanted to know about the necklace.
What about the necklace?
He asked her where it was.
[♪♪♪]
John?
What's going on?
I don't know.
I...
What the fuck do you mean, you don't know?
You told me we were safe.
We were.
And now?
Jesus, John.
Talk to me.
Listen to me.
I'll take care of this, all right?
Yeah.
Yeah, you will.
Diana, there is nothing in the world that means more to me than you and the kids.
[line disconnects]
[door opens then closes]
What do we got?
O'Bannon says John's lying about the last time he saw Danny.
- About what?
The Red Reef?
- I don't know.
Don't get too excited.
We're talking about O'Bannon here, and he may be full of shit.
So, bring him in.
He says he won't come in unless we give him immunity.
If he wants immunity, he better tell us a good fucking story.
He says he has one, and he says he can prove it.
Can he?
He may...
He may know something.

Gnarly Harley.
[Harley] Christ.
Heard you skipped town.
Well, I skipped back.
Your mom dead yet?
That's really sweet.
I wouldn't mind rummaging through that shithole of hers.
It's always the batshit ones like her...
Sit on treasure half their life, don't know what they have.
I need the...
The thing I sold you right before I skipped town.
I need it back.
It's important.
Well...
I'm sure you'd be willing to part with whatever you got in that sack.
[Eric] Heavenly Protection.
Hummel?
Well...
Fuck me, O'Bannon.
We got a deal.
Worth maybe half a Hummel.
O'Bannon, you, my friend, are a crack negotiator.
You come back and see me anytime, huh?
[John] Hey.
Yeah?
You go to my daughter's school, and out in the parking lot, you ask her fucking questions?
The last thing I wanted to do was drag Janey in here and ask her questions in front of everybody, and turn this whole thing into something that it wasn't, okay?
She's 16.
You're right, John.
I should've reached out to you first.
I'm sorry.

Contracts my lawyers drew up.
All they need is your brother's signature.
Oh, thank you.
I will look at these.
Any more nuisance suits you needed to settle?
Yes.
About that, I have...
Mezcal, two.
- Sure.
- I'm sorry.
You were saying...
The problem has been taken care of.
It's just that there is a campaign deficit involved.
I see.
You've been more than generous, obviously.
Have you sent my office an invoice for the legal work you did for me?
Excuse me?
The legal consulting you did.
- I didn't...
- For your brother's boatyard. [chuckles]
Have you billed my office yet?
Mr. Gilbert, it's a considerable amount of money.
Well, you've earned it.
We have you on retainer, isn't that right?
Mr. Gilbert, I'm not comfortable with that.
Nonsense.
You've done such fine work.
Send the bill as soon as possible.
- Better to wrap up these things quickly.
- [man] Here you go.
You'll learn with a little creative thinking, you can accomplish anything you want.
God, I hate fucking fishing.
My girl's gone.
What does that mean?
It means she's gone.
She's not calling me back.
I don't know what the fuck to do, man.
I'm sorry, dude.
That sucks.
Maybe I should just get the fuck out of here.
Go back to Miami, track her ass down.
You still working on that thing you said you were working on down here?
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
There you go.
Grade A Rayburn cash, as promised.
Holy fuck.
You got this from them?
I can get a lot more.
'Cause not only are these people fucking amateurs, they got a guilty fucking conscience.
As well they fucking should.
John...
Detective fucking John Rayburn, he lied to the cops.
Well, how do you know?
I know.
And if I tell the cops, then they'll clear me from all the shit that happened at the Red Reef.
You're talking to the cops?
- They came to me.
- Oh, come on.
- What?
- Come on, man.
This is our golden opportunity, man.
This is our golden ticket, bro.
You don't have a murder beef hanging over you, do you?
I'd love to see John Rayburn exposed
- as the fraud that he is.
- Shut the fuck up.
What is this?
- I think it's my cut.
- No.
This is nothing.
That's shit, okay?
- It's gonna get fucking wet.
- Leave it there.
- It's gonna get wet on the fucking...
- Leave it.
You don't deserve that shit.
This is nothing compared to what we could really have, you dipshit.
You understand?
Yeah, I fucking understand, but I got a situation I gotta deal with.
You got a sit...?
Fuck your situation, okay?
[♪♪♪]
You know for a fact that John lied to the cops?
Yeah.
You got proof?
I can prove it, yeah.
Well, then... you don't go to the cops.
You don't bite the tit that feeds you, you hear me?
'Cause we own this motherfucker.
[cell phone ringing]
- Yeah?
- [Hank] You at a computer?
Yeah.
You're gonna get a secure link and a password.
It'll be good for 24 hours.
It should get you what you need.
Hey, Hank?
- Thank you.
- Yep.
[typing on keyboard]
[♪♪♪]
[Sally] You okay?
Hi.
Yeah.
I'm fine.
Have you seen Marco?
Why would you ask me that?
Well, whenever you used to have a problem with a boy...
I'd find you out here.
Mom, that was in high school.
[chuckles] Yeah, I guess so.
[Eve] Hi, Meg!
What is she doing here?
She's staying here with Nolan.
For how long?
As long as they want.
Was that why you invited me here?
Yeah.
I thought you all should know.
Maybe you can... tell John and Kevin.
Uh...
Okay.
Yeah.
How is Kevin anyway?
He's going to meetings.
He's good.
And he just got Roy Gilbert to invest in the boatyard so now he's doing good financially, too.
Mom?
I do not like that man.
I thought he was a friend of Dad's.
Your father and Roy Gilbert were not friends.
Did something happen that I should know about?
What you should know is that Roy Gilbert wants what's best for Roy Gilbert, and that's all he wants.
And he'll do whatever it takes to get it.
Hey, I wanna show you something.
Come with me.
[Eve] All right.
I don't know, Kev.
- Why, is something wrong with the terms?
- No.
The terms are fine.
It's...
Do you realize that you're gonna give up control to Gilbert?
The other guy wanted to bend me over and kick me out.
It's a hell of a lot better than that, isn't it?
Maybe just... think it over some more.
Give me some time to do some due diligence on Gilbert.
I don't have any more time.
What's going on?
You're the one who hooked me up with this guy in the first place.
- You know the guy that I paid off?
- Yeah.
Gilbert is the one that gave me the money.
I just don't know if that is the kind of guy you should be doing business with.
Meg, if I fuck this up, if I lose this...
I'm telling you, I'm gonna end up selling fucking drills down at Harry's Hardware.
- No, you're not.
- Yes, Meg, I am.
And how come when you and John need money for the campaign, there's not a problem?
Suddenly, I'm in trouble, and now you're concerned?
- I'm trying to help you.
- Are you trying to help me?
Because I need this to happen.
I don't want this.
I need this.
- I get it.
- I don't think you do.
You know what?
I think I'm starting to realize something.
Now that Danny's gone, and I'm starting to sober up, get my shit together a little bit, I think you're scared.
About what?
There might not be a fuck-up in the family anymore for you and John to feel superior to.
Are you kidding me right now?
- Number one, I am not John.
- Well...
Number two, it's a fucked-up thing to say.
You're gonna have to go find somebody else to save.
Just make sure that they're a real failure so that you can come in and rescue them.
I'm not having this conversation with you.
If you wanna do this, Kevin, you go ahead and do it.
The paperwork is fine.
Okay.
Well, thank you for your legal advice, but if I need any more, I'll be sure to look elsewhere.

Your mama has a very pretty voice.
I guess.
He just hates it when I sing.
How could you hate that?
[Eve] He used to like it.
He wanted me to sing all the time when he was a little boy.
Yeah, okay.
I'm going to bed.
- You're leaving?
Just like that?
- [Nolan] Yep.
- Good night.
- [Nolan] Good night.
Robert used to sing that song for the kids, all the time.
Yeah, I know.
Danny told me.
That's why I learned it.
And Danny used to sing it to Nolan when he was a baby.
Danny couldn't sing.
- Yeah, but he did it anyway.
- [laughs] [strumming and scatting]
[♪♪♪]
[knocks] [footsteps approaching]
Miss Ortiz, thank you very much for seeing me again.
I'm glad you called.
I think it's very important that we get your story out there.
Please, come in.
[♪♪♪]
[inaudible dialogue]
Clay, what was that all about?
You didn't hear?
Reporters got some dirt on Diaz and IA is following up.
It's our responsibility to inform you we're opening up an investigation.
Since when does IA take orders from the local paper?
A report like this has to be looked into.
You understand.
It's a serious allegation.
Do you understand that that's all that this is?
It's just an allegation.
You'll get a chance to explain your side of the story, Detective.
If there's been no misconduct... you have nothing to worry about.
No.
No.
No, no.
I don't care if it's Barbara fucking Walters, the answer's gonna be the same.
I'm not available for comment.
There's gonna be an official inquiry.
Shit.
Rayburn.
Probably.
All right, first thing:
don't say a word to anyone.
And call the union lawyer.
It's only gonna be a matter of days before they start sticking microscopes up our ass.
What about the case?
Full steam ahead.
Tell O'Bannon he's got immunity.
- DA's gonna need more than that.
- Draw up the paperwork.
If O'Bannon's got the goods, I wanna be ready to roll.
[door opens, then closes]
Listen, O'Bannon.
I haven't heard back from you.
I think you're full of shit.
You want immunity, you gotta give me something before you run out of time.
You know the number.
I'm waiting for your call, okay?
[Marco on recording] You want immunity, you gotta give me something before you run out of time.
You know the number.
I'm waiting for your call, okay?
[♪♪♪]
You know, you better split.
He's gonna be here soon.
I'll get finished here with John, and I'll swing by your place.
See you, man.
Good luck, bro.
[Eric] Danny.
Danny.
Dan-o.
[♪♪♪]
[rock music playing over speakers]
- [Kevin] Oh, hey, Mr. Gilbert.
- Hey,
I thought I'd stop by and check out my investment.
Uh...
Okay.
- If I still have an investment.
- [laughs]
Meg said she left the papers with you.
- Yeah.
Sorry about that.
I got...
- Have you signed?
We got a deal?
- I can give you another day or two.
- No, no.
No, I got them right here.
- Uh-huh.
Everything check out?
- Yeah.
- No questions?
Issues?
- No.
No, not really.
"Not really"?
[chuckles] Is that the sound of second thoughts I hear?
Yeah.
Just...
Just me and you here, Kevin.
No need beating around the buttonwood.
If you need more time to go over it...
No, no.
I don't need any more time.
Oh.
Okay, then.
Yep.
Got anything to drink around here to toast our new partnership?
Uh, actually, I don't drink, but I have a large assortment of juices and sodas if...
Well, we'll skip it, then. [chuckles] We'll celebrate another time.
- I'll take you and the wife out to dinner.
- Sounds good.
- Yeah.
You'll hear from me soon.
- Okay.
Thank you.
Thanks for coming down.
[upbeat Latin music playing over speakers]
- Oh, hey.
- Hm.
Hey.
Where the hell you been, huh?
[clears throat]
I was starting to think that you'd forgotten all about me.
I got a little surprise for you.
- Yeah?
- Oh, yeah.
[Eve] Holy shit.
How much is this?
I got a lot more back at the motel, so why don't you say we go back, you and me, and roll in it?
I can't.
Why not?
She invited me to stay.
"She" who?
Sally Rayburn.
So, uh... me and Nolan are at the inn now.
Like...
Like you're living there?
I don't know.
We'll see.
What happened?
Uh, I think she realized she made a mistake shutting me out, you know... and she's got a hole in her life without Danny.
Hm.
Wow, you really worked that situation, didn't you?
I didn't work anything.
They're my family.
Yeah, but...
But they're not.
[tires screeching]
So, let me come and see it.
Let me come and check your situation.
I can't screw this up.
Hey.
This thing between you and me wasn't gonna last forever.
You knew that.
Yeah.
Did I?
It's crazy 'cause I'm the only one who's ever really taken care of you.
I mean, your parents didn't.
Right?
Danny didn't.
And these people aren't gonna either.
It's just me.
Just me, really.
[♪♪♪]
I just don't think it's a good idea for them to be living here.
Well, you seemed okay with it earlier.
You sprung it on me, Mom.
I didn't get time to think about it.
Nolan's my grandson, your nephew.
It's a non-issue.
Okay, but what about her, then?
Mom, she came here begging us for money.
She's using you.
I appreciate that you're trying to fix things that happened in the past, but it's just not the right way to do it.
Well, it's my way of doing it.
She's not who you think she is.
Who is she?
You don't know what she does or who she associates with.
Who?
Who does she associate with?
I can't tell you that right now, Mom.
[scoffs] God, you sound like your brother John, telling me things without telling me anything.
I just don't want her to be around this place, okay?
- Well, it's not your decision.
- Well, it should be, Mom.
- Oh, it should?
- Yeah.
John and Kevin and I, we all own part of this place, too.
If you're gonna make a decision like that, you should ask us.
Did you and John and Kevin build this from nothing?
Did you raise five children while trying to run a business, Meg?
Did you almost have a fucking nervous breakdown trying to make everybody else happy but yourself?
Mom...
Did you?
No.
Then don't talk to me about your rights here.
I asked you to cut Danny back into the business before he died.
You didn't do it, did you?
No.
Mom, I don't know what she's up to, but it's not good.
Nolan and Eve are not going anywhere.
[door opens]
[Marco] Hey, man.
Good to see you.
Do you really think that IA bullshit's gonna scare me off?
I don't know what to think.
I know what you did.
And you know what you did.
[♪♪♪]
Good night, Marco.
You know, if you keep going down this road... you're not gonna find what you think.
It's not gonna end well for you.
Well, then, it looks like it's not gonna end well for either of us.
[vehicle approaching]
[♪♪♪]
[Kevin] What's going on here?
What are you guys doing on the boat?
You must be Kevin.
My apologies.
Didn't expect you to be here this late.
Uh...
Who the fuck are you?
I'm Luis, an old friend of Mr. Gilbert's.
- Is there a problem, Luis?
- No, not at all.
We just needed to take the boat out for a bit.
Nothing to worry about.
Does Mr. Gilbert know about this?
Of course.
It's good to meet you.
Look forward to seeing more of each other.
[♪♪♪]
How can we work this out?
I don't know, John.
John?
What happened?
- [John crying]
- Oh, my God.
Is that Danny?
I'm gonna take John's car to the hospital.
Take Danny and go home.
I wanna tell my story.

If I stay... nothing's gonna change.
I'm always gonna be what they think I am.

Me?
You gotta be careful, John.
We can never be what we want if we stay here.
Where are you gonna go?
It doesn't matter.
Just gonna get in Dad's old truck and... just drive.
Hi.
What's going on?
I'm taking him.
It's time he came with me, you know?
Hey, thanks for letting me stay here.
Yeah.
You take care of yourself.
[♪♪♪]
[Eve] Hey, come on.
I shouldn't be here.
I'm not gonna pretend like I'm sorry about the other night.
But I do know you're seeing someone, so I don't wanna screw things up for you.
That's not what I'm talking about.
What are you talking about, then?
You lied to me.
Alec Moros wasn't in this house that night.
- Yes, he was.
- Meg, he was in New York.
No, that's not true.
I spoke to him.
He was in New York.
I mean, well, maybe I got the nights confused.
Hmm.
Hear me out.
Don't speak, and hear me out.
Sure.
You lied to me... and I think John lied to me, too, and maybe you're protecting your brother.
Now, that's not a very smart thing for you to be doing right now.
I'm...
I probably got the nights confused, Marco, but I didn't lie to you.
Meg.
I'm giving you a chance to get out in front of it, whatever it is, before it's too late.
[♪♪♪]
And come in and talk to me again.
Please.
I don't know anything, Marco.
Be careful.
I know John's family, but you need to look out for yourself.
[door opens] [door closes]
[Chelsea] Mom, you have to keep track of these.
[Mrs. O'Bannon] It's too fucking complicated.
I laid them out for you.
Where's your pill schedule?
What?
The sheet I gave her.
The laminated one.
[TV playing indistinctly]
- I don't know.
- Jesus Christ, Eric.
You gotta help me out with this.
- She can't keep half the pills down.
- I toss that shit right up.
Well, I can give you something for nausea.
What I need is groceries.
Lemon Cremes and the Fudgies with the little stripes.
What's that?
[Mrs. O'Bannon] It's called "Heavenly Protection."
I can't fucking believe this.
You can't afford to keep buying this crap.
On TV, they said there were only 43 left, and they knocked the price way down.
Put it on the shelf.
No.
We're returning it.
Now, this pill, this one you take twice a day.
Once in the morning and once at night.
This one you take three times a day.
And this blue one... only take when you need it.
For constipation.
[knock on door]
- Who is it?
- [man] Monroe County Sheriff's Department.
[sighs]
[Eric] What do you want?
I'm sorry to bother you at home.
Can I have a word with you?
What happened with you and Marco?
Meg, we have to assume that Marco is no longer a friend of ours.
This isn't just Aguirre's bullshit anymore.
'Cause Marco, he's...
He's trying to make a case against us, Meg.
He knows I lied.
He says you lied to him, too.
- He has no way of knowing that, Meg.
- Then why would he say it?
Because he doesn't have anything.
That's why he brought you in.
Let me guess.
He brings you in, asks you a bunch of questions, and then he tries to turn you against me.
Basically, yeah.
The only way that he can get anything on us... is if he turns us against each other.
Short of that, he's just gonna keep looking for every angle he can.
There's something that you don't know.
The information about Aguirre and his wife...
I released that.
Why are you telling me this now?
Because there's more to the story.
Marco was the responding officer.
He never filed an incident report.
And three weeks later, the sheriff's department hired him.
You realize that Internal Affairs will have a field day with that.
That Marco and Aguirre will be waist-high in shit.
And they won't even have time to wipe their asses, Meg.
I just can't do it, John.
I can't do that to him.
He's never ever done one thing to hurt me.
How close is he?
I don't know.
The other day, you said something.
Something that I gotta get clear on.
You told me to look into the Rayburn family.
Why did you tell me that?
Ask John.
Why?
He was the last person to see Danny alive.
Why just John?
The whole family saw him together.
When?
Night of the Red Reef, Danny went to the inn.
- Whole family was there...
- I'm not talking about that, dude.
- Then what are you talking about?
- I'm talking about...
I'm talking about the next morning.
The next morning, John didn't see anybody.
He had a heart attack at his house.
I mean...
- That's what he's saying?
- Yeah.
He was working his lawn, he had a heart attack, he called Meg, Meg took him to the hospital.
He's lying.
[♪♪♪]
He met with Danny.
How do you know?
I know.
[Eric scoffs]
Dude...
I know shit.
Some shit that I have not... fucking told anyone.
What shit do you know?
Uh-uh.
I need protection.
I tell my story, I want full fucking immunity.
Immunity from what?
Everything.
Anything.
'Cause I talk, God knows what you motherfuckers gonna try to pop on me.
Well, then I need more.
John saw Danny?
Where?
When?
Immunity... or I don't fucking say shit.
Prove to me that you know something.
Go ask John's daughter about the necklace that Danny gave her.
What necklace?
Just ask her.
[camera whirring] [gate squeaking, then clangs]
So, what you're saying is you wanna take a look at our security feed.
We just wanna see how far back the footage goes for the traffic along this stretch of road.
It's the only access to the beach.
Uh-huh.
And my tax dollars are going towards you coming here and hassling me over my private personal property?
What you'd be doing is helping Monroe County Sheriff Department in a number of investigations, ongoing.
Well, that doesn't answer my question.
Yes, your tax dollars do pay my salary.
I'm very grateful for that.
I assume you have some sort of a signed warrant.
You know, maybe there's a misunderstanding here.
I have no interest at all about your property.
I only want to know about the traffic that moves along this road.
That's it.
That's what the feds told Sheldon Burkes over at Magnolia Farms two years ago.
[John chuckles]
Listen, it's just this...
It's just this stretch of road.
Why don't we reopen this once we get that warrant?
Have a good day.
Yeah.
You, too, you son of a bitch.
[Ozzy] Baby.
Hey, babe?
Babe, check this out.
Look what I got.
[playing]
Oh, man.
[clicks tongue]
[line ringing]
[Eve on recording] Hey, leave a message.
Hey, luscious.
Where you at?
I just drove all the way to Miami, and I got you something.
Oh, yeah.
I can't wait to see your face when you see the...
When you...
When you, um...
Um...
Baby, um, where you at, huh?
Do, um...?
I mean, your shit...
Your shit's not here.
Where the fuck you at?
You wanna call me back and tell me what the fuck is going on?
Huh?
Okay.
Bye.
[Sally] The shower's been leaking for a year, and I can't seem to get anybody to fix it.
- Do we get maid service?
- [Sally chuckles]
[Sally] Paying guests get maid service.
Yeah.
We don't need any of that.
I'm happy to have you.
But while you're here, I expect you to help out.
Doing what?
- Whatever Sally wants.
- Well, we'll find something.
There's no end to the things that need to get done around here.
Yeah.
It'll be nice to be useful.
Just whatever you need.
This was always a family place.
Hasn't seemed much like that lately, but, um... maybe you two can change that.
Let's, uh...
Let's go in, and I'll show you the space.
I'm going over to Paul's.
Hm.
Are you still working on that assignment?
Yeah.
It's due tomorrow.
- Good luck with it, honey.
- [Ben] Bye, guys.
Have a good night.
[Diana] I downloaded that app.
Seriously, I hate you.
Why?
It's fun.
I can't stop playing it.
I don't know how you get anything done.
It's called multi-tasking, Mom.
Mm.
Yeah.
I should try that sometime.
I'm glad he's gone.
What?
Nolan.
I just couldn't stand him here anymore.
He showed up... after Danny was gone, and no one even knew he existed until then?
Nope.
Now, what does that mean to you?
Nothing.
[scoffs]
Should I be worried about him?
You said you didn't wanna talk about this.
Let's not talk about this.
I wanna know.
Should I be worried about him?
No.
[♪♪♪]
[indistinct voices over radio]
[John] Hank.
[Hank] Hey.
Whiskey and cigars?
You must be in quite a jam.
Well, I like you.
Yeah, I doubt that.
Forget about this.
Let's say you hook me up with that sister of yours.
You realize I got a gun on my hip, don't you?
Listen, I was over at the Cardozo Farms the other day.
I'm surprised that bastard let you on his property, given you're an agent of the government and all.
No, that's what...
He didn't let me on, but I'd like to get on.
What for?
Well, you know, it's an investigation.
[exhales sharply] What do you need?
I'd like to look at the security system over there.
Like, as in the cameras?
That's right.
You can't get a warrant?
There's nothing you can do?
They keep everything on servers these days.
I don't have the resources.
What, are you fucking telling me you can't?
I can't.
All right.
Well... enjoy my fucking cigars.
- [Hank] Hey, John.
- Yeah?
I might know a guy who's into that kind of thing.
- Can you trust him?
- Absolutely.
He owes me a couple favors, too.
What do you need?
On the north gate, there are two cameras.
I wanna know what's on those cameras over the past six months.
I'll call my guy.
I can't make any promises, but... when he gets back to me, you'll be the first to know.
I appreciate that.
[Hank] See you, buddy.
[engine rumbling]
Shit.
- [Roy] Hello there, sir.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Hope I'm not overstepping.
- No.
Wanted a place to park this sucker for a week or so.
Hey, trust me, you buy this place, you got all the docking space you need.
- Oh, I like the sound of that.
- [laughs]
- Hey, come on.
Let me get you a coffee.
- Yeah, sure.
- [sighs]
- So?
My offer.
Now, that's contingent upon you sticking around.
You want me to stay?
Absolutely.
You know the place, you know the clientele.
I want you in charge of all operations.
- There a problem?
- No.
Uh...
Wow.
Um...
Thank you.
I'm just not used to people having faith in me, that's all.
- Oh...
- I appreciate this.
Oh, it's a gift to get to do the thing you love.
- Brings out the best in people.
Mm.
- Yes, sir.
So, that number work for you?
- Yeah.
That's gonna work.
- [chuckles]
- That's gonna work just fine.
- Beautiful.
I'll draw up the paperwork, get it to your sister.
Thank you.
- Oh, yeah.
- Thank you, Mr. Gilbert.
Yeah.
[sighs]
Janey.
- Is my dad okay?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- What are you doing here?
- Relax.
Your dad's fine.
I just need to ask you a couple questions.
About what?
Danny.
Okay.
The day that Danny went missing, you, your mom, your brother, you guys were out of town,
- right?
- Right.
And that was right after you and Danny went out on the boat?
Uh-huh.
That day he mentioned something about a necklace.
Oh, yeah.
Uncle Danny gave me some necklace as, like, a present.
My dad didn't like it.
Is that it?
This?
Oh, no.
It was a seahorse.
- A seahorse.
- Yeah.
I was just looking for it the other day.
You know where it is?
Nope.
I don't know.
My dad took it from me, like, when I first got it.
And I asked him about it the other day, but...
- But what?
- He said he lost it.
- What does it matter anyway, though?
- Actually, it doesn't matter.
I'm just tying up loose ends.
Boring cop shit. [chuckles]
Okay.
Well, remind me not to become a boring cop.
I will.
Bye, Janey.
[Janey] See you.
- Hey, Mom.
- Hi, honey.
Was that Marco you were talking to?
Yeah, it was.
What did he want?
Oh, he just wanted to ask me some questions.
[♪♪♪]
Wait, wait...
What did...?
What did he ask her about?
I couldn't exactly grill Janey for details, but he wanted to know about the necklace.
What about the necklace?
He asked her where it was.
[♪♪♪]
John?
What's going on?
I don't know.
I...
What the fuck do you mean, you don't know?
You told me we were safe.
We were.
And now?
Jesus, John.
Talk to me.
Listen to me.
I'll take care of this, all right?
Yeah.
Yeah, you will.
Diana, there is nothing in the world that means more to me than you and the kids.
[line disconnects]
[door opens then closes]
What do we got?
O'Bannon says John's lying about the last time he saw Danny.
- About what?
The Red Reef?
- I don't know.
Don't get too excited.
We're talking about O'Bannon here, and he may be full of shit.
So, bring him in.
He says he won't come in unless we give him immunity.
If he wants immunity, he better tell us a good fucking story.
He says he has one, and he says he can prove it.
Can he?
He may...
He may know something.

Gnarly Harley.
[Harley] Christ.
Heard you skipped town.
Well, I skipped back.
Your mom dead yet?
That's really sweet.
I wouldn't mind rummaging through that shithole of hers.
It's always the batshit ones like her...
Sit on treasure half their life, don't know what they have.
I need the...
The thing I sold you right before I skipped town.
I need it back.
It's important.
Well...
I'm sure you'd be willing to part with whatever you got in that sack.
[Eric] Heavenly Protection.
Hummel?
Well...
Fuck me, O'Bannon.
We got a deal.
Worth maybe half a Hummel.
O'Bannon, you, my friend, are a crack negotiator.
You come back and see me anytime, huh?
[John] Hey.
Yeah?
You go to my daughter's school, and out in the parking lot, you ask her fucking questions?
The last thing I wanted to do was drag Janey in here and ask her questions in front of everybody, and turn this whole thing into something that it wasn't, okay?
She's 16.
You're right, John.
I should've reached out to you first.
I'm sorry.

Contracts my lawyers drew up.
All they need is your brother's signature.
Oh, thank you.
I will look at these.
Any more nuisance suits you needed to settle?
Yes.
About that, I have...
Mezcal, two.
- Sure.
- I'm sorry.
You were saying...
The problem has been taken care of.
It's just that there is a campaign deficit involved.
I see.
You've been more than generous, obviously.
Have you sent my office an invoice for the legal work you did for me?
Excuse me?
The legal consulting you did.
- I didn't...
- For your brother's boatyard. [chuckles]
Have you billed my office yet?
Mr. Gilbert, it's a considerable amount of money.
Well, you've earned it.
We have you on retainer, isn't that right?
Mr. Gilbert, I'm not comfortable with that.
Nonsense.
You've done such fine work.
Send the bill as soon as possible.
- Better to wrap up these things quickly.
- [man] Here you go.
You'll learn with a little creative thinking, you can accomplish anything you want.
God, I hate fucking fishing.
My girl's gone.
What does that mean?
It means she's gone.
She's not calling me back.
I don't know what the fuck to do, man.
I'm sorry, dude.
That sucks.
Maybe I should just get the fuck out of here.
Go back to Miami, track her ass down.
You still working on that thing you said you were working on down here?
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
There you go.
Grade A Rayburn cash, as promised.
Holy fuck.
You got this from them?
I can get a lot more.
'Cause not only are these people fucking amateurs, they got a guilty fucking conscience.
As well they fucking should.
John...
Detective fucking John Rayburn, he lied to the cops.
Well, how do you know?
I know.
And if I tell the cops, then they'll clear me from all the shit that happened at the Red Reef.
You're talking to the cops?
- They came to me.
- Oh, come on.
- What?
- Come on, man.
This is our golden opportunity, man.
This is our golden ticket, bro.
You don't have a murder beef hanging over you, do you?
I'd love to see John Rayburn exposed
- as the fraud that he is.
- Shut the fuck up.
What is this?
- I think it's my cut.
- No.
This is nothing.
That's shit, okay?
- It's gonna get fucking wet.
- Leave it there.
- It's gonna get wet on the fucking...
- Leave it.
You don't deserve that shit.
This is nothing compared to what we could really have, you dipshit.
You understand?
Yeah, I fucking understand, but I got a situation I gotta deal with.
You got a sit...?
Fuck your situation, okay?
[♪♪♪]
You know for a fact that John lied to the cops?
Yeah.
You got proof?
I can prove it, yeah.
Well, then... you don't go to the cops.
You don't bite the tit that feeds you, you hear me?
'Cause we own this motherfucker.
[cell phone ringing]
- Yeah?
- [Hank] You at a computer?
Yeah.
You're gonna get a secure link and a password.
It'll be good for 24 hours.
It should get you what you need.
Hey, Hank?
- Thank you.
- Yep.
[typing on keyboard]
[♪♪♪]
[Sally] You okay?
Hi.
Yeah.
I'm fine.
Have you seen Marco?
Why would you ask me that?
Well, whenever you used to have a problem with a boy...
I'd find you out here.
Mom, that was in high school.
[chuckles] Yeah, I guess so.
[Eve] Hi, Meg!
What is she doing here?
She's staying here with Nolan.
For how long?
As long as they want.
Was that why you invited me here?
Yeah.
I thought you all should know.
Maybe you can... tell John and Kevin.
Uh...
Okay.
Yeah.
How is Kevin anyway?
He's going to meetings.
He's good.
And he just got Roy Gilbert to invest in the boatyard so now he's doing good financially, too.
Mom?
I do not like that man.
I thought he was a friend of Dad's.
Your father and Roy Gilbert were not friends.
Did something happen that I should know about?
What you should know is that Roy Gilbert wants what's best for Roy Gilbert, and that's all he wants.
And he'll do whatever it takes to get it.
Hey, I wanna show you something.
Come with me.
[Eve] All right.
I don't know, Kev.
- Why, is something wrong with the terms?
- No.
The terms are fine.
It's...
Do you realize that you're gonna give up control to Gilbert?
The other guy wanted to bend me over and kick me out.
It's a hell of a lot better than that, isn't it?
Maybe just... think it over some more.
Give me some time to do some due diligence on Gilbert.
I don't have any more time.
What's going on?
You're the one who hooked me up with this guy in the first place.
- You know the guy that I paid off?
- Yeah.
Gilbert is the one that gave me the money.
I just don't know if that is the kind of guy you should be doing business with.
Meg, if I fuck this up, if I lose this...
I'm telling you, I'm gonna end up selling fucking drills down at Harry's Hardware.
- No, you're not.
- Yes, Meg, I am.
And how come when you and John need money for the campaign, there's not a problem?
Suddenly, I'm in trouble, and now you're concerned?
- I'm trying to help you.
- Are you trying to help me?
Because I need this to happen.
I don't want this.
I need this.
- I get it.
- I don't think you do.
You know what?
I think I'm starting to realize something.
Now that Danny's gone, and I'm starting to sober up, get my shit together a little bit, I think you're scared.
About what?
There might not be a fuck-up in the family anymore for you and John to feel superior to.
Are you kidding me right now?
- Number one, I am not John.
- Well...
Number two, it's a fucked-up thing to say.
You're gonna have to go find somebody else to save.
Just make sure that they're a real failure so that you can come in and rescue them.
I'm not having this conversation with you.
If you wanna do this, Kevin, you go ahead and do it.
The paperwork is fine.
Okay.
Well, thank you for your legal advice, but if I need any more, I'll be sure to look elsewhere.

He just hates it when I sing.
How could you hate that?
[Eve] He used to like it.
He wanted me to sing all the time when he was a little boy.
Yeah, okay.
I'm going to bed.
- You're leaving?
Just like that?
- [Nolan] Yep.
- Good night.
- [Nolan] Good night.
Robert used to sing that song for the kids, all the time.
Yeah, I know.
Danny told me.
That's why I learned it.
And Danny used to sing it to Nolan when he was a baby.
Danny couldn't sing.
- Yeah, but he did it anyway.

[♪♪♪]
[knocks] [footsteps approaching]
Miss Ortiz, thank you very much for seeing me again.
I'm glad you called.
I think it's very important that we get your story out there.
Please, come in.
[♪♪♪]
[inaudible dialogue]
Clay, what was that all about?
You didn't hear?
Reporters got some dirt on Diaz and IA is following up.
It's our responsibility to inform you we're opening up an investigation.
Since when does IA take orders from the local paper?
A report like this has to be looked into.
You understand.
It's a serious allegation.
Do you understand that that's all that this is?
It's just an allegation.
You'll get a chance to explain your side of the story, Detective.
If there's been no misconduct... you have nothing to worry about.
No.
No.
No, no.
I don't care if it's Barbara fucking Walters, the answer's gonna be the same.
I'm not available for comment.
There's gonna be an official inquiry.
Shit.
Rayburn.
Probably.
All right, first thing:
don't say a word to anyone.
And call the union lawyer.
It's only gonna be a matter of days before they start sticking microscopes up our ass.
What about the case?
Full steam ahead.
Tell O'Bannon he's got immunity.
- DA's gonna need more than that.
- Draw up the paperwork.
If O'Bannon's got the goods, I wanna be ready to roll.
[door opens, then closes]
Listen, O'Bannon.
I haven't heard back from you.
I think you're full of shit.
You want immunity, you gotta give me something before you run out of time.
You know the number.
I'm waiting for your call, okay?
[Marco on recording] You want immunity, you gotta give me something before you run out of time.
You know the number.
I'm waiting for your call, okay?
[♪♪♪]
You know, you better split.
He's gonna be here soon.
I'll get finished here with John, and I'll swing by your place.
See you, man.
Good luck, bro.
[Eric] Danny.
Danny.
Dan-o.
[♪♪♪]
[rock music playing over speakers]
- [Kevin] Oh, hey, Mr. Gilbert.
- Hey,
I thought I'd stop by and check out my investment.
Uh...
Okay.
- If I still have an investment.
- [laughs]
Meg said she left the papers with you.
- Yeah.
Sorry about that.
I got...
- Have you signed?
We got a deal?
- I can give you another day or two.
- No, no.
No, I got them right here.
- Uh-huh.
Everything check out?
- Yeah.
- No questions?
Issues?
- No.
No, not really.
"Not really"?
[chuckles] Is that the sound of second thoughts I hear?
Yeah.
Just...
Just me and you here, Kevin.
No need beating around the buttonwood.
If you need more time to go over it...
No, no.
I don't need any more time.
Oh.
Okay, then.
Yep.
Got anything to drink around here to toast our new partnership?
Uh, actually, I don't drink, but I have a large assortment of juices and sodas if...
Well, we'll skip it, then. [chuckles] We'll celebrate another time.
- I'll take you and the wife out to dinner.
- Sounds good.
- Yeah.
You'll hear from me soon.
- Okay.
Thank you.
Thanks for coming down.
[upbeat Latin music playing over speakers]
- Oh, hey.
- Hm.
Hey.
Where the hell you been, huh?
[clears throat]
I was starting to think that you'd forgotten all about me.
I got a little surprise for you.
- Yeah?
- Oh, yeah.
[Eve] Holy shit.
How much is this?
I got a lot more back at the motel, so why don't you say we go back, you and me, and roll in it?
I can't.
Why not?
She invited me to stay.
"She" who?
Sally Rayburn.
So, uh... me and Nolan are at the inn now.
Like...
Like you're living there?
I don't know.
We'll see.
What happened?
Uh, I think she realized she made a mistake shutting me out, you know... and she's got a hole in her life without Danny.
Hm.
Wow, you really worked that situation, didn't you?
I didn't work anything.
They're my family.
Yeah, but...
But they're not.
[tires screeching]
So, let me come and see it.
Let me come and check your situation.
I can't screw this up.
Hey.
This thing between you and me wasn't gonna last forever.
You knew that.
Yeah.
Did I?
It's crazy 'cause I'm the only one who's ever really taken care of you.
I mean, your parents didn't.
Right?
Danny didn't.
And these people aren't gonna either.
It's just me.
Just me, really.
[♪♪♪]
I just don't think it's a good idea for them to be living here.
Well, you seemed okay with it earlier.
You sprung it on me, Mom.
I didn't get time to think about it.
Nolan's my grandson, your nephew.
It's a non-issue.
Okay, but what about her, then?
Mom, she came here begging us for money.
She's using you.
I appreciate that you're trying to fix things that happened in the past, but it's just not the right way to do it.
Well, it's my way of doing it.
She's not who you think she is.
Who is she?
You don't know what she does or who she associates with.
Who?
Who does she associate with?
I can't tell you that right now, Mom.
[scoffs] God, you sound like your brother John, telling me things without telling me anything.
I just don't want her to be around this place, okay?
- Well, it's not your decision.
- Well, it should be, Mom.
- Oh, it should?
- Yeah.
John and Kevin and I, we all own part of this place, too.
If you're gonna make a decision like that, you should ask us.
Did you and John and Kevin build this from nothing?
Did you raise five children while trying to run a business, Meg?
Did you almost have a fucking nervous breakdown trying to make everybody else happy but yourself?
Mom...
Did you?
No.
Then don't talk to me about your rights here.
I asked you to cut Danny back into the business before he died.
You didn't do it, did you?
No.
Mom, I don't know what she's up to, but it's not good.
Nolan and Eve are not going anywhere.
[door opens]
[Marco] Hey, man.
Good to see you.
Do you really think that IA bullshit's gonna scare me off?
I don't know what to think.
I know what you did.
And you know what you did.
[♪♪♪]
Good night, Marco.
You know, if you keep going down this road... you're not gonna find what you think.
It's not gonna end well for you.
Well, then, it looks like it's not gonna end well for either of us.
[vehicle approaching]
[♪♪♪]
[Kevin] What's going on here?
What are you guys doing on the boat?
You must be Kevin.
My apologies.
Didn't expect you to be here this late.
Uh...
Who the fuck are you?
I'm Luis, an old friend of Mr. Gilbert's.
- Is there a problem, Luis?
- No, not at all.
We just needed to take the boat out for a bit.
Nothing to worry about.
Does Mr. Gilbert know about this?
Of course.
It's good to meet you.
Look forward to seeing more of each other.
[♪♪♪]
How can we work this out?
I don't know, John.
John?
What happened?
- [John crying]
- Oh, my God.
Is that Danny?
I'm gonna take John's car to the hospital.
Take Danny and go home.
I wanna tell my story.

Just gonna get in Dad's old truck and... just drive.
Hi.
What's going on?
I'm taking him.
It's time he came with me, you know?
Hey, thanks for letting me stay here.
Yeah.
You take care of yourself.
Hey, come on.
I shouldn't be here.
I'm not gonna pretend like I'm sorry about the other night.
But I do know you're seeing someone, so I don't wanna screw things up for you.
That's not what I'm talking about.
What are you talking about, then?
You lied to me.
Alec Moros wasn't in this house that night.
- Yes, he was.
- Meg, he was in New York.
No, that's not true.
I spoke to him.
He was in New York.
I mean, well, maybe I got the nights confused.
Hmm.
Hear me out.
Don't speak, and hear me out.
Sure.
You lied to me... and I think John lied to me, too, and maybe you're protecting your brother.
Now, that's not a very smart thing for you to be doing right now.
I'm...
I probably got the nights confused, Marco, but I didn't lie to you.
Meg.
I'm giving you a chance to get out in front of it, whatever it is, before it's too late.
And come in and talk to me again.
Please.
I don't know anything, Marco.
Be careful.
I know John's family, but you need to look out for yourself.
Mom, you have to keep track of these.
It's too fucking complicated.
I laid them out for you.
Where's your pill schedule?
What?
The sheet I gave her.
The laminated one.
- I don't know.
- Jesus Christ, Eric.
You gotta help me out with this.
- She can't keep half the pills down.
- I toss that shit right up.
Well, I can give you something for nausea.
What I need is groceries.
Lemon Cremes and the Fudgies with the little stripes.
What's that?
It's called "Heavenly Protection."
I can't fucking believe this.
You can't afford to keep buying this crap.
On TV, they said there were only 43 left, and they knocked the price way down.
Put it on the shelf.
No.
We're returning it.
Now, this pill, this one you take twice a day.
Once in the morning and once at night.
This one you take three times a day.
And this blue one... only take when you need it.
For constipation.
- Who is it?
- Monroe County Sheriff's Department.
What do you want?
I'm sorry to bother you at home.
Can I have a word with you?
What happened with you and Marco?
Meg, we have to assume that Marco is no longer a friend of ours.
This isn't just Aguirre's bullshit anymore.
'Cause Marco, he's...
He's trying to make a case against us, Meg.
He knows I lied.
He says you lied to him, too.
- He has no way of knowing that, Meg.
- Then why would he say it?
Because he doesn't have anything.
That's why he brought you in.
Let me guess.
He brings you in, asks you a bunch of questions, and then he tries to turn you against me.
Basically, yeah.
The only way that he can get anything on us... is if he turns us against each other.
Short of that, he's just gonna keep looking for every angle he can.
There's something that you don't know.
The information about Aguirre and his wife...
I released that.
Why are you telling me this now?
Because there's more to the story.
Marco was the responding officer.
He never filed an incident report.
And three weeks later, the sheriff's department hired him.
You realize that Internal Affairs will have a field day with that.
That Marco and Aguirre will be waist-high in shit.
And they won't even have time to wipe their asses, Meg.
I just can't do it, John.
I can't do that to him.
He's never ever done one thing to hurt me.
How close is he?
I don't know.
The other day, you said something.
Something that I gotta get clear on.
You told me to look into the Rayburn family.
Why did you tell me that?
Ask John.
Why?
He was the last person to see Danny alive.
Why just John?
The whole family saw him together.
When?
Night of the Red Reef, Danny went to the inn.
- Whole family was there...
- I'm not talking about that, dude.
- Then what are you talking about?
- I'm talking about...
I'm talking about the next morning.
The next morning, John didn't see anybody.
He had a heart attack at his house.
I mean...
- That's what he's saying?
- Yeah.
He was working his lawn, he had a heart attack, he called Meg, Meg took him to the hospital.
He's lying.
He met with Danny.
How do you know?
I know.
Dude...
I know shit.
Some shit that I have not... fucking told anyone.
What shit do you know?
Uh-uh.
I need protection.
I tell my story, I want full fucking immunity.
Immunity from what?
Everything.
Anything.
'Cause I talk, God knows what you motherfuckers gonna try to pop on me.
Well, then I need more.
John saw Danny?
Where?
When?
Immunity... or I don't fucking say shit.
Prove to me that you know something.
Go ask John's daughter about the necklace that Danny gave her.
What necklace?
Just ask her.
So, what you're saying is you wanna take a look at our security feed.
We just wanna see how far back the footage goes for the traffic along this stretch of road.
It's the only access to the beach.
Uh-huh.
And my tax dollars are going towards you coming here and hassling me over my private personal property?
What you'd be doing is helping Monroe County Sheriff Department in a number of investigations, ongoing.
Well, that doesn't answer my question.
Yes, your tax dollars do pay my salary.
I'm very grateful for that.
I assume you have some sort of a signed warrant.
You know, maybe there's a misunderstanding here.
I have no interest at all about your property.
I only want to know about the traffic that moves along this road.
That's it.
That's what the feds told Sheldon Burkes over at Magnolia Farms two years ago.
Listen, it's just this...
It's just this stretch of road.
Why don't we reopen this once we get that warrant?
Have a good day.
Yeah.
You, too, you son of a bitch.
Baby.
Hey, babe?
Babe, check this out.
Look what I got.
Oh, man.
Hey, leave a message.
Hey, luscious.
Where you at?
I just drove all the way to Miami, and I got you something.
Oh, yeah.
I can't wait to see your face when you see the...
When you...
When you, um...
Um...
Baby, um, where you at, huh?
Do, um...?
I mean, your shit...
Your shit's not here.
Where the fuck you at?
You wanna call me back and tell me what the fuck is going on?
Huh?
Okay.
Bye.
The shower's been leaking for a year, and I can't seem to get anybody to fix it.
Do we get maid service?
Paying guests get maid service.
Yeah.
We don't need any of that.
I'm happy to have you.
But while you're here, I expect you to help out.
Doing what?
- Whatever Sally wants.
- Well, we'll find something.
There's no end to the things that need to get done around here.
Yeah.
It'll be nice to be useful.
Just whatever you need.
This was always a family place.
Hasn't seemed much like that lately, but, um... maybe you two can change that.
Let's, uh...
Let's go in, and I'll show you the space.
I'm going over to Paul's.
Hm.
Are you still working on that assignment?
Yeah.
It's due tomorrow.
- Good luck with it, honey.
- Bye, guys.
Have a good night.
I downloaded that app.
Seriously, I hate you.
Why?
It's fun.
I can't stop playing it.
I don't know how you get anything done.
It's called multi-tasking, Mom.
Mm.
Yeah.
I should try that sometime.
I'm glad he's gone.
What?
Nolan.
I just couldn't stand him here anymore.
He showed up... after Danny was gone, and no one even knew he existed until then?
Nope.
Now, what does that mean to you?
Nothing.
Should I be worried about him?
You said you didn't wanna talk about this.
Let's not talk about this.
I wanna know.
Should I be worried about him?
No.
Hank.
Hey.
Whiskey and cigars?
You must be in quite a jam.
Well, I like you.
Yeah, I doubt that.
Forget about this.
Let's say you hook me up with that sister of yours.
You realize I got a gun on my hip, don't you?
Listen, I was over at the Cardozo Farms the other day.
I'm surprised that bastard let you on his property, given you're an agent of the government and all.
No, that's what...
He didn't let me on, but I'd like to get on.
What for?
Well, you know, it's an investigation.
What do you need?
I'd like to look at the security system over there.
Like, as in the cameras?
That's right.
You can't get a warrant?
There's nothing you can do?
They keep everything on servers these days.
I don't have the resources.
What, are you fucking telling me you can't?
I can't.
All right.
Well... enjoy my fucking cigars.
- Hey, John.
- Yeah?
I might know a guy who's into that kind of thing.
- Can you trust him?
- Absolutely.
He owes me a couple favors, too.
What do you need?
On the north gate, there are two cameras.
I wanna know what's on those cameras over the past six months.
I'll call my guy.
I can't make any promises, but... when he gets back to me, you'll be the first to know.
I appreciate that.
See you, buddy.
Shit.
- Hello there, sir.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Hope I'm not overstepping.
- No.
Wanted a place to park this sucker for a week or so.
Hey, trust me, you buy this place, you got all the docking space you need.
Oh, I like the sound of that.
- Hey, come on.
Let me get you a coffee.
- Yeah, sure.
So?
My offer.
Now, that's contingent upon you sticking around.
You want me to stay?
Absolutely.
You know the place, you know the clientele.
I want you in charge of all operations.
- There a problem?
- No.
Uh...
Wow.
Um...
Thank you.
I'm just not used to people having faith in me, that's all.
- Oh...
- I appreciate this.
Oh, it's a gift to get to do the thing you love.
- Brings out the best in people.
Mm.
- Yes, sir.
So, that number work for you?
Yeah.
That's gonna work.
- That's gonna work just fine.
- Beautiful.
I'll draw up the paperwork, get it to your sister.
Thank you.
- Oh, yeah.
- Thank you, Mr. Gilbert.
Yeah.
Janey.
- Is my dad okay?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- What are you doing here?
- Relax.
Your dad's fine.
I just need to ask you a couple questions.
About what?
Danny.
Okay.
The day that Danny went missing, you, your mom, your brother, you guys were out of town,
- right?
- Right.
And that was right after you and Danny went out on the boat?
Uh-huh.
That day he mentioned something about a necklace.
Oh, yeah.
Uncle Danny gave me some necklace as, like, a present.
My dad didn't like it.
Is that it?
This?
Oh, no.
It was a seahorse.
- A seahorse.
- Yeah.
I was just looking for it the other day.
You know where it is?
Nope.
I don't know.
My dad took it from me, like, when I first got it.
And I asked him about it the other day, but...
- But what?
- He said he lost it.
- What does it matter anyway, though?
- Actually, it doesn't matter.
I'm just tying up loose ends.
Boring cop shit.
Okay.
Well, remind me not to become a boring cop.
I will.
Bye, Janey.
See you.
- Hey, Mom.
- Hi, honey.
Was that Marco you were talking to?
Yeah, it was.
What did he want?
Oh, he just wanted to ask me some questions.
Wait, wait...
What did...?
What did he ask her about?
I couldn't exactly grill Janey for details, but he wanted to know about the necklace.
What about the necklace?
He asked her where it was.
John?
What's going on?
I don't know.
I...
What the fuck do you mean, you don't know?
You told me we were safe.
We were.
And now?
Jesus, John.
Talk to me.
Listen to me.
I'll take care of this, all right?
Yeah.
Yeah, you will.
Diana, there is nothing in the world that means more to me than you and the kids.
What do we got?
O'Bannon says John's lying about the last time he saw Danny.
- About what?
The Red Reef?
- I don't know.
Don't get too excited.
We're talking about O'Bannon here, and he may be full of shit.
So, bring him in.
He says he won't come in unless we give him immunity.
If he wants immunity, he better tell us a good fucking story.
He says he has one, and he says he can prove it.
Can he?
He may...
He may know something.
Gnarly Harley.
Christ.
Heard you skipped town.
Well, I skipped back.
Your mom dead yet?
That's really sweet.
I wouldn't mind rummaging through that shithole of hers.
It's always the batshit ones like her...
Sit on treasure half their life, don't know what they have.
I need the...
The thing I sold you right before I skipped town.
I need it back.
It's important.
Well...
I'm sure you'd be willing to part with whatever you got in that sack.
Heavenly Protection.
Hummel?
Well...
Fuck me, O'Bannon.
We got a deal.
Worth maybe half a Hummel.
O'Bannon, you, my friend, are a crack negotiator.
You come back and see me anytime, huh?
Hey.
Yeah?
You go to my daughter's school, and out in the parking lot, you ask her fucking questions?
The last thing I wanted to do was drag Janey in here and ask her questions in front of everybody, and turn this whole thing into something that it wasn't, okay?
She's 16.
You're right, John.
I should've reached out to you first.
I'm sorry.

Contracts my lawyers drew up.
All they need is your brother's signature.
Oh, thank you.
I will look at these.
Any more nuisance suits you needed to settle?
Yes.
About that, I have...
Mezcal, two.
- Sure.
- I'm sorry.
You were saying...
The problem has been taken care of.
It's just that there is a campaign deficit involved.
I see.
You've been more than generous, obviously.
Have you sent my office an invoice for the legal work you did for me?
Excuse me?
The legal consulting you did.
- I didn't...
- For your brother's boatyard.
Have you billed my office yet?
Mr. Gilbert, it's a considerable amount of money.
Well, you've earned it.
We have you on retainer, isn't that right?
Mr. Gilbert, I'm not comfortable with that.
Nonsense.
You've done such fine work.
Send the bill as soon as possible.
- Better to wrap up these things quickly.
- Here you go.
You'll learn with a little creative thinking, you can accomplish anything you want.
God, I hate fucking fishing.
My girl's gone.
What does that mean?
It means she's gone.
She's not calling me back.
I don't know what the fuck to do, man.
I'm sorry, dude.
That sucks.
Maybe I should just get the fuck out of here.
Go back to Miami, track her ass down.
You still working on that thing you said you were working on down here?
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
There you go.
Grade A Rayburn cash, as promised.
Holy fuck.
You got this from them?
I can get a lot more.
'Cause not only are these people fucking amateurs, they got a guilty fucking conscience.
As well they fucking should.
John...
Detective fucking John Rayburn, he lied to the cops.
Well, how do you know?
I know.
And if I tell the cops, then they'll clear me from all the shit that happened at the Red Reef.
You're talking to the cops?
- They came to me.
- Oh, come on.
- What?
- Come on, man.
This is our golden opportunity, man.
This is our golden ticket, bro.
You don't have a murder beef hanging over you, do you?
I'd love to see John Rayburn exposed
- as the fraud that he is.
- Shut the fuck up.
What is this?
- I think it's my cut.
- No.
This is nothing.
That's shit, okay?
- It's gonna get fucking wet.
- Leave it there.
- It's gonna get wet on the fucking...
- Leave it.
You don't deserve that shit.
This is nothing compared to what we could really have, you dipshit.
You understand?
Yeah, I fucking understand, but I got a situation I gotta deal with.
You got a sit...?
Fuck your situation, okay?
You know for a fact that John lied to the cops?
Yeah.
You got proof?
I can prove it, yeah.
Well, then... you don't go to the cops.
You don't bite the tit that feeds you, you hear me?
'Cause we own this motherfucker.
- Yeah?
- You at a computer?
Yeah.
You're gonna get a secure link and a password.
It'll be good for 24 hours.
It should get you what you need.
Hey, Hank?
- Thank you.
- Yep.
You okay?
Hi.
Yeah.
I'm fine.
Have you seen Marco?
Why would you ask me that?
Well, whenever you used to have a problem with a boy...
I'd find you out here.
Mom, that was in high school.
Yeah, I guess so.
Hi, Meg!
What is she doing here?
She's staying here with Nolan.
For how long?
As long as they want.
Was that why you invited me here?
Yeah.
I thought you all should know.
Maybe you can... tell John and Kevin.
Uh...
Okay.
Yeah.
How is Kevin anyway?
He's going to meetings.
He's good.
And he just got Roy Gilbert to invest in the boatyard so now he's doing good financially, too.
Mom?
I do not like that man.
I thought he was a friend of Dad's.
Your father and Roy Gilbert were not friends.
Did something happen that I should know about?
What you should know is that Roy Gilbert wants what's best for Roy Gilbert, and that's all he wants.
And he'll do whatever it takes to get it.
Hey, I wanna show you something.
Come with me.
All right.
I don't know, Kev.
- Why, is something wrong with the terms?
- No.
The terms are fine.
It's...
Do you realize that you're gonna give up control to Gilbert?
The other guy wanted to bend me over and kick me out.
It's a hell of a lot better than that, isn't it?
Maybe just... think it over some more.
Give me some time to do some due diligence on Gilbert.
I don't have any more time.
What's going on?
You're the one who hooked me up with this guy in the first place.
- You know the guy that I paid off?
- Yeah.
Gilbert is the one that gave me the money.
I just don't know if that is the kind of guy you should be doing business with.
Meg, if I fuck this up, if I lose this...
I'm telling you, I'm gonna end up selling fucking drills down at Harry's Hardware.
- No, you're not.
- Yes, Meg, I am.
And how come when you and John need money for the campaign, there's not a problem?
Suddenly, I'm in trouble, and now you're concerned?
- I'm trying to help you.
- Are you trying to help me?
Because I need this to happen.
I don't want this.
I need this.
- I get it.
- I don't think you do.
You know what?
I think I'm starting to realize something.
Now that Danny's gone, and I'm starting to sober up, get my shit together a little bit, I think you're scared.
About what?
There might not be a fuck-up in the family anymore for you and John to feel superior to.
Are you kidding me right now?
- Number one, I am not John.
- Well...
Number two, it's a fucked-up thing to say.
You're gonna have to go find somebody else to save.
Just make sure that they're a real failure so that you can come in and rescue them.
I'm not having this conversation with you.
If you wanna do this, Kevin, you go ahead and do it.
The paperwork is fine.
Okay.
Well, thank you for your legal advice, but if I need any more, I'll be sure to look elsewhere.

Your mama has a very pretty voice.
I guess.
He just hates it when I sing.
How could you hate that?
He used to like it.
He wanted me to sing all the time when he was a little boy.
Yeah, okay.
I'm going to bed.
- You're leaving?
Just like that?
- Yep.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Robert used to sing that song for the kids, all the time.
Yeah, I know.
Danny told me.
That's why I learned it.
And Danny used to sing it to Nolan when he was a baby.
Danny couldn't sing.
Yeah, but he did it anyway.
Miss Ortiz, thank you very much for seeing me again.
I'm glad you called.
I think it's very important that we get your story out there.
Please, come in.
Clay, what was that all about?
You didn't hear?
Reporters got some dirt on Diaz and IA is following up.
It's our responsibility to inform you we're opening up an investigation.
Since when does IA take orders from the local paper?
A report like this has to be looked into.
You understand.
It's a serious allegation.
Do you understand that that's all that this is?
It's just an allegation.
You'll get a chance to explain your side of the story, Detective.
If there's been no misconduct... you have nothing to worry about.
No.
No.
No, no.
I don't care if it's Barbara fucking Walters, the answer's gonna be the same.
I'm not available for comment.
There's gonna be an official inquiry.
Shit.
Rayburn.
Probably.
All right, first thing:
don't say a word to anyone.
And call the union lawyer.
It's only gonna be a matter of days before they start sticking microscopes up our ass.
What about the case?
Full steam ahead.
Tell O'Bannon he's got immunity.
- DA's gonna need more than that.
- Draw up the paperwork.
If O'Bannon's got the goods, I wanna be ready to roll.
Listen, O'Bannon.
I haven't heard back from you.
I think you're full of shit.
You want immunity, you gotta give me something before you run out of time.
You know the number.
I'm waiting for your call, okay?
You want immunity, you gotta give me something before you run out of time.
You know the number.
I'm waiting for your call, okay?
You know, you better split.
He's gonna be here soon.
I'll get finished here with John, and I'll swing by your place.
See you, man.
Good luck, bro.
Danny.
Danny.
Dan-o.
- Oh, hey, Mr. Gilbert.
- Hey,
I thought I'd stop by and check out my investment.
Uh...
Okay.
If I still have an investment.
Meg said she left the papers with you.
- Yeah.
Sorry about that.
I got...
- Have you signed?
We got a deal?
- I can give you another day or two.
- No, no.
No, I got them right here.
- Uh-huh.
Everything check out?
- Yeah.
- No questions?
Issues?
- No.
No, not really.
"Not really"?
Is that the sound of second thoughts I hear?
Yeah.
Just...
Just me and you here, Kevin.
No need beating around the buttonwood.
If you need more time to go over it...
No, no.
I don't need any more time.
Oh.
Okay, then.
Yep.
Got anything to drink around here to toast our new partnership?
Uh, actually, I don't drink, but I have a large assortment of juices and sodas if...
Well, we'll skip it, then.
We'll celebrate another time.
- I'll take you and the wife out to dinner.
- Sounds good.
- Yeah.
You'll hear from me soon.
- Okay.
Thank you.
Thanks for coming down.
- Oh, hey.
- Hm.
Hey.
Where the hell you been, huh?
I was starting to think that you'd forgotten all about me.
I got a little surprise for you.
- Yeah?
- Oh, yeah.
Holy shit.
How much is this?
I got a lot more back at the motel, so why don't you say we go back, you and me, and roll in it?
I can't.
Why not?
She invited me to stay.
"She" who?
Sally Rayburn.
So, uh... me and Nolan are at the inn now.
Like...
Like you're living there?
I don't know.
We'll see.
What happened?
Uh, I think she realized she made a mistake shutting me out, you know... and she's got a hole in her life without Danny.
Hm.
Wow, you really worked that situation, didn't you?
I didn't work anything.
They're my family.
Yeah, but...
But they're not.
So, let me come and see it.
Let me come and check your situation.
I can't screw this up.
Hey.
This thing between you and me wasn't gonna last forever.
You knew that.
Yeah.
Did I?
It's crazy 'cause I'm the only one who's ever really taken care of you.
I mean, your parents didn't.
Right?
Danny didn't.
And these people aren't gonna either.
It's just me.
Just me, really.
I just don't think it's a good idea for them to be living here.
Well, you seemed okay with it earlier.
You sprung it on me, Mom.
I didn't get time to think about it.
Nolan's my grandson, your nephew.
It's a non-issue.
Okay, but what about her, then?
Mom, she came here begging us for money.
She's using you.
I appreciate that you're trying to fix things that happened in the past, but it's just not the right way to do it.
Well, it's my way of doing it.
She's not who you think she is.
Who is she?
You don't know what she does or who she associates with.
Who?
Who does she associate with?
I can't tell you that right now, Mom.
God, you sound like your brother John, telling me things without telling me anything.
I just don't want her to be around this place, okay?
- Well, it's not your decision.
- Well, it should be, Mom.
- Oh, it should?
- Yeah.
John and Kevin and I, we all own part of this place, too.
If you're gonna make a decision like that, you should ask us.
Did you and John and Kevin build this from nothing?
Did you raise five children while trying to run a business, Meg?
Did you almost have a fucking nervous breakdown trying to make everybody else happy but yourself?
Mom...
Did you?
No.
Then don't talk to me about your rights here.
I asked you to cut Danny back into the business before he died.
You didn't do it, did you?
No.
Mom, I don't know what she's up to, but it's not good.
Nolan and Eve are not going anywhere.
Hey, man.
Good to see you.
Do you really think that IA bullshit's gonna scare me off?
I don't know what to think.
I know what you did.
And you know what you did.
Good night, Marco.
You know, if you keep going down this road... you're not gonna find what you think.
It's not gonna end well for you.
Well, then, it looks like it's not gonna end well for either of us.
What's going on here?
What are you guys doing on the boat?
You must be Kevin.
My apologies.
Didn't expect you to be here this late.
Uh...
Who the fuck are you?
I'm Luis, an old friend of Mr. Gilbert's.
- Is there a problem, Luis?
- No, not at all.
We just needed to take the boat out for a bit.
Nothing to worry about.
Does Mr. Gilbert know about this?
Of course.
It's good to meet you.
Look forward to seeing more of each other.
How can we work this out?
I don't know, John.
John?
What happened?
Oh, my God.
Is that Danny?
I'm gonna take John's car to the hospital.
Take Danny and go home.
I wanna tell my story.

The woman that brought her in is asking for you.
Her name is grace Adams?
Grace?
She's here now?
Yeah.
She's wearing an angels jacket.
Think she may work here.
No, no, she used to.
Used to work here.
Hm.
[ Curtain opens ]
Grace.
Neal.
Hi.
This is roseline.
Hello, roseline.
How do you do?
[ Chuckles ]
I brought roseline back with me from port-au-prince.
Grace spent the past year working with operation hope in Haiti.
Wow.
Good for you.
Thanks.
Roseline has a tumor on her spinal cord that's making it increasingly difficult for her to walk.
I brought her back on a tourist visa in hopes that I could get her the surgery that she needs.
You'll need Campbell for that, and he, uh...
Well, he won't be easy to convince.
Let's start with a ct scan and take it from there.
I'll order it now.
Thank you.
So, who's grace?
Told you, she's a doctor who used to work here.
I know that.
I'm asking who she is to you.
[ Door opens ]
Shut up.
You've seen me in clothes before.
Not during a shift.
Oh, I don't know why I said yes to this.
I'm a doctor, not a whatever I am.
You're a doctor no matter what you're wearing.
If I'm gonna be here, I'd rather be in center stage.
What is that, a tamale?
For breakfast?
As my abuela Anita used to say,
"you wear the skin you're born in."
Yeah, but did she also mention that your heart has to live in there?
Forgive her, abuela, for she knows nada.
You don't have to believe.
You just have to be okay if I believe.
Lizzie, we've been through this 15 times before, and you've always come home.
It's not like the last 15 times.
James, this is different.
Is everything, uh, okay?
She wants me to get randor here, the cryogenics company.
How's it work, anyway?
Freeze my brains and my vital organs.
Snake oil.
It's not snake oil.
I started a kickstarter campaign to pay for it last year.
Doc, can you please just tell her that this is crazy?
I don't know anything about it, so...
You know my chances of surviving this, right?
Tell him that.
We don't give percentages here.
Well, then let me put it another way.
Is there a chance that she could live?
Of course.
But you need to believe that you can.
I do.
But...
I have a parachute in case I'm wrong.
Yeah.
Neal:
She's only in the country this week.
She goes back to Haiti, where she's living in a refugee camp.
This is not an emergent case.
Why are we talking about this?
That's why we are talking about it, otherwise I would have just called someone to come down and pick her up.
We are asking for a favor.
It's a pretty big favor, leanne.
The surgery alone will cost well into the six figures.
Who is she?
She's a little girl who needs our help.
I can throw a tennis ball off the roof of this hospital and hit about 30 little girls that need our help.
She's deteriorating, and we can help her.
You mean I can help her.
You want me to perform major surgery on a 13-year-old girl, and yet I don't see a pediatric referral, no pre-op work-up, no chest x-rays, ekgs, blood work.
Should I keep going?
All those tests and referrals take days.
She doesn't have that kind of time.
Her visa will run out.
Not my problem.
Frankly, I'm surprised at you, leanne.
I'm sure you are.
He's an arrogant ass.
But he's not entirely wrong.
If she'd been hit by a bus and had come in by ambulance, she'd be in that O.R. right now, no questions asked.
Yeah, well, I guess she wasn't lucky enough to be hit by a bus.
Christa:
You did the right thing coming here.
But it's normal for a new mom to feel rundown, especially after a c-section.
Still, this... this feels different than I expected.
I'm a marathon runner.
I was doing three miles a day a couple weeks before I gave birth to this little guy.
Your EKG was normal.
I'm short of breath, and something just feels wrong.
I-I can't explain it.
It's...
It's more than just rundown.
We should get an X-Ray, run some tests, make sure there's no infections or any other complications.
Is it okay if I bring him?
Well, you're gonna be in the X-Ray machine for a while.
You have any family in the waiting area?
No.
No, I'm a...
I'm a single mom.
I di...
I didn't have anyone to ask.
We can hold him for you.
We can?
We'll take turns.
[ Coos ]
Okay.
[ Gasping, coughs ]
Check the chest tube.
Did she pop her lung again?
No, there's condensation on them.
They're still working.
What's happening to her?
Sounds like fluid.
Okay.
Lizzie, listen to me.
We need to take action or you will die in minutes.
No.
Let me be.
Don't do anything.
No!
What?
!
Li-li...
She'll make it through this.
She always does.
James, let me go.
What?
No!
Lizzie, don't...
Don't give up, okay?
Don't give up.
Look, they're gonna fix you.
It's time.
No!
It's not time, all right?
They're gonna fix you.
They're gonna... they're gonna make you better, okay?
James, I'm not so sure if...
Lizzie!
Don't give up, honey, all right?
Please, please don't give up, all right?
You're gonna make it.
You're gonna make it.
They're gonna make you better.
They're gonna fix you, all right?
Please?
All right.
Let's go.
[ Gasping ]
[ Monitor beeping ]
Angus:
What happened?
He was in a lot of pain, then I think he fainted.
His abdomen is rock-hard.
I need more n.S. And levophed.
He's septic.
Did you get the sepsis work-up?
Not yet.
"Not yet"?
Damn it, Angus.
How's his ivc?
Collapsed.
The tank is low.
What's he on?
Vanc, zosyn, and four liters of n.S. So far.
[ Rapid beeping ]
Systolic is 50.
M.A.P. Of 40.
He's gonna arrest.
Let's get him to center stage.
Come here.
We can't give up on roseline.
You heard Campbell.
Even leanne doesn't think it's possible.
What do you want me to do?
Look behind God's curtain.
Sorry?
That's what you used to say about surgery.
That it was like seeing behind God's curtain.
I was flirting.
No, you weren't.
[ Chuckles ]
Come on.
We've never let anything stop us before.
Grace, there's no us.
You're still mad.
What did you expect?
That you'd drop in here and we'd just pick up where we left off?
I never meant to hurt you, Neal.
And you found someone else.
After you and I were over.
Fine.
Whatever you think of me...
Please don't take it out on this sweet little girl.
You know me better than that.
In a lot of ways, I think I know you better than anyone.
No.
No, you don't.
Okay, Angus, focus.
He needs a high line.
You got it?
Angus, your attending asked you a question.
Yes.
Yes.
I've got the levophed up.
Watch from here, okay?
I'll start another line on the right.
Jesse:
Guys, she's satting in the 70s.
Can't wait anymore.
We need to intubate.
What does that mean?
We have to put her in a coma so we can put a breathing tube in.
Sux and etomidate, Dr. Guthrie?
Yes.
Have them ready, please.
Wait!
Um...
Her...
Her transplant surgeon said that if she goes on a breathing machine, she might never come off of it.
I'm sorry, but there's no other way.
There may be another way.
Lizzie, can you squeeze my hand?
She is still responding to commands.
We could try bipap.
James:
Wha-what's that?
It's a machine that helps her breathe through a mask, not a tube.
But she has to be able to work with the machine.
If she can, it could help clear the fluid in her lungs and save her.
Yes.
Uh, right, honey?
Yes, we... we want this.
Let's do it now, Dr. Savetti.
I got maybe 40 over palp.
Mike:
He's in cardiopulmonary collapse.
We got to attack this.
More fluids.
His mean arterial pressure was always above 65.
I didn't think he'd reach sepsis so fast.
Did you check other measures of profusion?
Of course.
Urine output?
Low.
Lactate?
High.
Look, I could not have predicted that this would happen so fast.
Come on.
Angus, you in on your line?
Man:
Make sure the icu is notified.
Angus?
!
Angus, you have a patient in distress.
Get those fluids in now.
We got this, Dr. Rorish.
Doesn't look like it to me.
Titrating levo now.
Risa:
Okay.
B.P. Rising.
90 over 60.
Angus, I don't know where your head is, but in this room, you've got one focus, and that's your patient.
Clear?
Dr. Rorish, can we talk, please?
Angus, take a break.
I'm the resident director now, and he's a resident.
So by definition, I direct the residents.
And I'm the director of the E.R., which means I direct you.
But by inserting yourself like that, you undermine my authority.
Do you have authority over your brother?
That's my problem.
Let me ask you, honestly, would you have ever tolerated anything like that from Taylor or perello when you had this job?
Look, I think we're both just trying to figure out how to put on these new uniforms and make them fit.
Mario:
You're doing great, Lizzie.
When you breathe in, the machine feels it and pushes air to help your lungs.
Woman:
Someone from randor cryogenics called.
They're pulling into the ambulance bay.
You called them?
So, y-you just agreed to all this until they could get here?
Y-you're...
You're giving up.
I'm not giving up.
Lizzie, I need you to believe that you can live.
I need you to believe that this will work.
I am gonna live.
Just not now.
[ Breathes deeply ] 50 years ago, no one could have imagined smartphones, the Internet...
Or salted chocolate.
[ Chuckles, sniffles ]
And 50 years from now, you'll wake me up, and we'll be together again.
In 50 years, I'll be 75.
[ Laughs, coughs ] 75 will be the new 20.
[ Chuckles ]
I'm gonna have to show you how everything works.
[ Sniffles ]
They'll have a program that'll download everything I need to know right into my brain.
Well, you always wanted to learn how to play saxophone.
[ Coughs ]
Next time I see you, I'll play it for you.
[ Chuckles ]
And then we can...
We can go have dinner on the moon.
[ Chuckles ]
You hate the cold.
I'll, um...
I'll check back in on her in a little bit.
Hey.
I thought you were off today.
You're from randor.
The cryo people?
So, does your boyfriend Campbell know you work for a cryogenics company?
Yes, and now the two of you have something in common...
He doesn't approve, either.
But it's allowed?
I can whatever the hell I want on my days off.
It's a job.
Dude...
Don't "dude" me.
I have over $250,000 in student-loan debts.
Randor pays me 30k.
To operate on dead bodies.
To prepare them for freezing.
You do know this is crazy, right?
Insane.
But who cares?
Clients are happy, nobody gets hurt, and I get paid.
[ Pager beeps ]
My people are here.
Your people?
Well, two nurses.
I got to go fill out paperwork to release the body when she dies.
[ Sighs ]
You'll get over it.
I knew it was gonna be a challenge having him on my own, but I... you know,
I thought I'd have a little time to ramp into it.
When he smiles back at you, you'll know it's all worth it.
Uh, did my test results come back?
Yes.
They're good.
Malaya has the results.
Malaya?
Of course.
Sorry.
We saw a post-op atelectasis...
A post-op what?
It sounds much worse than it is.
It's a partial collapsing of your lung.
An area of your left lung wasn't inflating properly, which explains your oxygen levels.
We don't think you have anything to worry about.
You're sure?
You should take it easy for a couple days, but you're fine.
I'll start the discharge paperwork.
I'm not even gonna ask you how you got this mri.
Look at the tumor.
It could kill roseline, leanne.
Yeah, I'm sympathetic, but the fact is it's not killing her right now.
You're hiding behind semantics.
Grace.
No.
The leanne I remember wouldn't hesitate to take this on.
You're not helping, grace.
Even if I supported you, Campbell refused.
You'd need a surgeon to sign on, and it'd have to be someone who is willing to go up against Campbell.
You two been talking?
No.
That's the universe talking.
Neal, has it ever occurred to you that maybe you've run so far from your father that you've run right past yourself?
When was the last time you had your prostate checked,
Mr. Delaney?
Dad?
A year ago.
They told me I had prostate cancer.
What?
Y-y-you've known for a y-y... a year?
I heard prostate cancer was a slow grower.
I was just trying to figure out what to do.
Um...
Unfortunately, your cancer wasn't so slow.
The tumor ended up perforating the colon.
We need to do surgery now...
A total colectomy.
What the hell is that?
We have to remove your entire large intestine.
Oh, my God.
And what's left for me when you're done?
Your life.
It won't be without complications.
I would imagine that.
W-what complications?
Urinary-tract issues, impotence...
Can we not talk about this now?
No, I am done with secrets.
[ Sighs ]
So, he... he's gonna need a-a colostomy bag?
Yeah.
You want me to crap in a bag?
Hell no.
They told me I cou...
I could get, uh, chemo.
And... and radiation, they said.
It's too late for that.
What would we do?
What's next?
Nothing's next.
I'm not doing it.
No!
This is not up to you.
I'm not dead yet.
And until I am, it is up to me.
The answer...
Is no.
[ Sniffles ]
Seems like you got a lot left to live for, Mr. Delaney.
[ Sighs ]
Why would I disrupt trauma-one by taking away one of its best doctors while simultaneously pissing off the director of the O.R.?
Because it's the best of both worlds.
May I?
How so?
The position is for a surgical attending who covers the emergency department.
That's what Cole Guthrie did.
Who better to cover trauma-one than someone who's spent his whole career working there?
Katie Miller says she still doesn't feel good.
I don't have any reason to hold her, but I don't feel right sending her home.
I mean, all alone with a new baby...
Thank you for talking to me about work and not asking me how I'm doing.
Be patient.
Trust me, you'll be surprised at how much you can endure, and how strong you actually are.
I'm sure you're right.
Wait a second.
Katie's heart rate was normal, right?
90.
A little high, but in the margin.
No, no, no, no, no.
Not if she's a marathon runner.
Normal is probably in the 40s for her.
P.E.?
Oh, God.
I got vitals.
I'll wire her up.
What's going on?
We just have to check something.
Have a seat.
Sats have dropped.
I'm getting worse?
[ Breathlessly ] I thought you said I was gonna be okay.
That's what we thought, but your oxygen levels are low.
We're gonna put you on something called an nrb mask.
It delivers high-concentration oxygen to your lungs.
Your symptoms could suggest a pulmonary embolism...
A clot in your lungs.
That would explain the elevated heart rate.
But I'm gonna be all right?
We need to get a ct scan right away to confirm whether it is a clot.
Ready?
¶¶
What are you doing, Dr. Hudson?
Dr. harbert approved my transfer to the surgical department.
He told me.
Congratulations.
However, the question remains.
What are you doing?
I'm...
Scheduling my patient's surgery.
This is still my department.
That means I assign your resident, your surgical nurses, your anesthesiologist, and your O.R.
Welcome to my team, Dr. Hudson.
Hand me my phone, please.
I want to check the scores.
Mom always said you were more stubborn than a constipated mule.
Yeah, well, mom isn't around anymore, is she?
[ Commotion in distance ]
Ohh, you didn't.
Man:
Odell Beckham!
Woman:
That's odell.
[ Laughs ]
Hey, Mia.
Long time no see.
Odell!
How you doing, coach?
Odell, please talk some sense into him.
You always were a smartass kid, you know that?
Where'd you get that jacket, man?
Michael Jackson's closet.
[ Chuckles ] Yeah, yeah!
[ Chuckles ]
Grace:
So, he still won't let you operate?
Neal:
I'm sorry, grace.
No, I'm sorry you made a major life decision for this only to have...
That's not why I made it.
It's just what precipitated it.
Excuse me, Dr. Adams, is the girl in the family room with you?
Yes, why?
You better come quick.
Christa:
I went to bring her a book, and I found her seizing on the floor.
Neal:
Let's get her on oxygen, please.
Okay, open your mouth.
Let's move her.
Let's move her.
¶¶
Neal:
Grace, what's her baseline blood pressure?
She runs low. 90s over 70s.
That's the tumor keeping it low.
B.P. Now 170 over 80.
That's better, right?
No, it's worse.
No, it's worse.
Leanne:
She's in autonomic dysreflexia.
Her pressure can swing wildly from high to low as a result of the tumor.
And relative to her baseline, it's way too high.
Let's sit her up and get her legs underneath her, try and get her pressure down.
If we don't lower it, she could stroke out.
Christa, nicardipine.
Five milligrams an hour.
Got it.
I'll get the piggyback pump.
Oh!
Okay.
Ohh, oh, oh, oh.
We can't wait for the nicardipine drip.
10 of labetalol, please.
Push, not drip!
Roseline...
Pushing 10 of labetalol now.
[ Speaks French ]
[ Sighs ] Vitals stable.
Thank God.
Neal, it's time.
You ready for this?
Campbell isn't gonna budge, leanne.
Whether it's tumor or edema, she's getting worse.
It's emergent now.
She could die.
Protocol is on our side now.
Let's get her upstairs.
¶¶
Hey, hey.
Hey, doc.
You know who this guy is?
Who doesn't?
Mr. Beckham, it's a real pleasure.
Thank you for helping me win my fantasy league two years in a row.
Where's my check?
You should've seen this guy when he first walked on the field.
He was catching balls with one hand the first day of practice.
I told anybody that'd listen that he was one of the greats.
Let's me and you talk, coach.
Thank you for doing this.
I'm glad I can.
Grace...
Why roseline?
What do you mean?
There must have been hundreds of girls in that camp.
Why this one?
A long time ago, there was another little girl.
She was smart.
In fact, they put her in classes with kids a lot older than her.
The kids laughed at her because she came to school with her own stepladder.
A stepladder?
She was too little for the blackboard.
She wanted to make sure that if she was called upon, she could reach it.
That was you.
It's also her.
I wanted to learn.
Nothing was gonna stop me.
I'm not gonna let anything stop her, either.
¶¶
Lizzie?
Lizzie!
What happened?
She lost pulses while on bipap.
Lizzie, honey, it's okay.
I'm...
I'm right here.
It's been four minutes.
Okay, let's do a pulse check.
[ Flatline ]
Come back to me, Lizzie.
Please, just fight.
Call it.
What?
What?
W-w-what's going on?
W-what are you...
Heather:
Mario.
I can't do anything until you call it.
Time of death... 4:15.
No!
[ Sobbing ]
Lizzie!
Oh.
Oh.
They're with me.
¶¶
I believe, Lizzie.
I believe, okay?
I love you.
And I'm gonna see you again, because I believe.
Pulmonary embolism.
Good catch.
What do you want to do?
You could give her alteplase, bust up the clot.
But that risks a hemorrhage of the c-section.
Dr. Rorish, you have a sec?
38-year-old female, pulmonary embolism in the right lung.
Vitals stable.
Elevated resting heart rate, and she's a new mom by a c-section.
You debating alteplase?
How many days post-op?
Four.
She could bleed out.
But if you wait, the saddle embolism could kill her.
So, what should we do?
I'd take the risk and do the alteplase now.
But talk to the patient.
Let her make an informed decision.
Malaya:
That's our recommendation, but the decision has to be yours.
[ Sighs ]
When I was...
Going through ivf, my mother asked me what would happen to him if something ever happened to me.
I thought she was just being unsupportive.
She thought what I was doing was selfish.
And maybe it was.
But I wanted a second chapter.
We're all entitled to that.
And then this little guy came along.
Turns out the chapter was being written by him, not me.
I want to live.
I still tell people about that eastern game.
Last quarter, down five, clock running out.
He hasn't changed my mind.
Not what I was hoping to hear.
We need to get you to surgery now.
They had you, uh, double-covered with the safety over the top.
Somehow, you...
You outran the coverage...
Odell:
Coach... and took it to the house.
Coach!
I'd never seen anybody get so much air.
[ Chuckles ] Coach.
And they held you...
Coach.
What?
!
You're just gonna keep talking, huh?
The more I talk, the less I have to listen to you trying to convince me to go under the knife.
You need the surgery.
Why?
Because if you don't, you'll die.
Maybe I'm okay with that.
That's selfish.
You never taught me about giving up, and now you're giving up on us?
Beth left me.
Mrs. coach.
Remember?
I mean, can you believe that after all these years?
She just decided she had enough of me.
We were supposed to spend our last, best years together, now I got nothing.
You have Mia.
[ Scoffs ] I don't want to be a burden on her.
[ Sighs ]
Coach, you taught me never take your losses into the next game.
Ever.
Good advice.
And what if it doesn't work?
What... what if I put her through all this and I'm still dead?
Then I'll give a beautiful speech at the funeral.
I'll let them all know that I would never be here without you.
You teached me how to have courage, play with grit, stay persistent.
We need to get this done.
[ Helicopter blades whirring ]
I mean, literally, I have this...
This weird sensation where I look at my hands, but...
They're not my hands.
[ Screams ]
You know what I mean?
One thing's for certain.
It is definitely going to get better.
You sure about that?
Absolutely.
[ Pager beeps, vibrates ]
Well, that didn't take long.
Welcome back.
Malaya.
It's good to see you back again.
You're worried about her.
In my experience, we heal better from the things that are done to us than the things that we do to others.
What does that mean?
My mother used to call it "getting right with God."
Now, you don't have to tell me anything that you don't want to, but that doesn't mean that I can't make a suggestion.
That man, the one who hurt our people, is still here.
His body is in the morgue, unclaimed.
Every other Saturday, the hospital buries all the unclaimed bodies in white oak cemetery.
[ Chuckling ] After what he did, you...
You want me to go pay my respects to him?
I didn't suggest that you go for him, young squire.
¶¶
I got o.B. And blood bank standing by.
Joshua's in the nursery having his bottle.
Okay.
We ready to do this?
You know who to call if this all goes wrong.
Nothing's gonna go wrong.
But, yes.
I promise I will look after him until your mother arrives.
God.
I didn't go through three rounds of ivf to have my crazy mother raise him.
This has to work.
Okay.
Jesse, hand the syringe to Malaya.
You got this?
Malaya:
Yeah.
You should begin to feel better immediately if it works the way we think it will, okay?
How are you feeling, Katie?
No different yet.
All right, breathe normally for me.
Oxygen climbing.
Oh.
Oh, I can feel it.
Oh, my God.
Christa:
Easy, calm breaths.
Oh, I can breathe!
Yeah.
Easy.
It worked!
Deep breaths.
Calm.
[ Monitor beeping ]
Oh.
What... what?
What... what's happening?
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
B.P.'S crashing, guys.
Jesse, get me a surgical tray.
Alert o.B.
Call in a verbal for blood and platelets.
We've got to re-open the c-section until o.B. Gets here.
Most of the bulk of the tumor is resected now.
Almost done?
Unfortunately, that's, uh, a rather big "almost."
You see this structure here?
That's the anterior spinal artery.
And you see this gray, shiny stuff?
Those are the bad cells that are literally eating into the artery.
There is one piece.
[ Sighs ] 100 more to go.
That's a defeating thought.
Oh, no.
Neal.
It's okay.
This can happen.
Pass me the hemostat, and get me a 5-0.
Come on.
Come on.
[ Grunts ] Damn.
More suction.
Damn.
Give me a 4-0.
Okay.
Suction, please, nurse.
Get this in.
Is everything okay?
What's wrong?
No.
Damn it.
Get me a Kelly.
More suction.
No.
Another 4-0, please.
Damn it, damn it, damn it.
Her blood pressure is plummeting.
Hang another two units, wide open.
Grace, I need help.
What do you need me to do?
Get Campbell.
What?
Campbell?
Yeah, he's done thousands of these.
Please, just get him.
Get him now.
Forceps and hemostat now.
Suction.
I clamped the anterior spinal artery...
I can see what you did.
Nurse, suture, please.
Suction.
One more suture, please.
You can come down off the blood now.
The bleeding has stopped.
Let me help with that flap.
Dr. Hudson, that's enough.
It's my case now.
You can go.
You don't want the help of another surgeon?
Is there one around?
It's okay.
O.B.'S on the way.
Blood bank's sending down a six-pack.
Tocin is up.
She's gonna need more sutures.
Oh, God.
She has a son upstairs.
We told her to do this.
¶¶ [ echoing ] Malaya, calm down.
Take a deep breath.
I can't do this.
Dr. Pineda!
Get back here right now.
This is your patient.
Dr. Pineda, look at me and listen to my voice.
Your patient's bleeding is similar to a postpartum hemorrhage.
Okay?
There's no one bleed source.
It's the whole uterus leaking blood.
So what do we do?
Should I get a...
No.
Stay right there.
What do we do for postpartum hemorrhaging?
Um, uh, we... we try to induce contractions.
Yes.
Good.
Now get over here.
I need your hands.
Okay, Dr. Lorenson, clamp that vessel, please.
Jesse, resect the skin.
You see that?
Right there.
That's the uterus.
Now, both of you get your hands in there.
Now, what happens when we massage the uterus directly?
It contracts.
Stopping the bleeding.
Good.
Yes.
Keep massaging.
Apply pressure, be firm.
Here, Jesse.
Thank you, Dr. Rorish.
A foley?
Yep.
All right, Dr. Lorenson, insert that catheter into the uterus.
We're gonna keep kneading the uterus while you inflate it.
Malaya, you've got a nurse waiting for your order.
Jesse, blood and fluids wide open, please.
Yes, doctor.
Is it working?
B.P.'S 90 over 80.
Bleeding is slowing down.
[ Sighs ] It's working.
You bet it is.
All right.
Let's pack these wounds, get her to an O.R.
Okay, guys.
Come on.
Let's go.
Pack it up.
[ Sighs ]
Jesse:
Yeah, so, you know, on my block,
I was, like, the leftie, you know?
I always used to get picked first, so...
That was my thing.
Mm-hmm.
Hey, uh... oh, oh.
Odell, this is little Joshua.
Hold him for a second.
Be right back.
Don't drop him, buddy.
Okay.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Easy.
Okay.
Leanne!
Leanne, leanne, leanne.
Odell Beckham.
Greatest catch in NFL history.
Hey.
You changed back into your scrubs.
What's up?
You got to wear the skin you're born in, mama.
Leanne.
You set me up.
How so?
You forgot to mention, when you asked me to meet with Neal, that the real reason he wanted the job was so he could perform an unapproved surgery on an undocumented alien minor.
That wasn't the only reason, and the surgery was approved.
Nonetheless, I'd like to know the motives of the people I hire.
Then you ought to try to get to know us better.
If you knew me at all, you would know I have to do this job my way.
Is that what the, uh...
The scrubs are all about?
Leanne:
It's a start.
Have a good day, doctor.
Mike:
How you feeling?
So good I want to crap my pants.
But I guess those days are over.
At least you have a sense of humor.
I don't.
Odell does.
He's out in the waiting room signing his 400th autograph right now.
Hey, you said earlier that he invited you to his charity event as a prop.
[ Chuckles ] Yeah.
You want to know why he really invited you, Mr. Delaney?
His speech is on the Internet, and here's what he said...
"A great man once told me that temperament is displayed"
in failure, but character is revealed in success.
"Pete Delaney taught me that."
Pete Delaney taught me how to win.
He also taught me how to be a winner.
You remember that?
I remember everything you taught me, coach.
Every single thing.
[ Chuckles ]
You got your camera?
Come on.
One for posterity.
Here we go.
[ Camera shutter clicks ]
[ Joshua cooing ]
Malaya:
You fought like a...
A warrior?
Like a mom.
Aww.
Hi.
[ Chuckles ]
[ Sighs ]
Hey, you.
Hi.
How did I do?
It worked, roseline.
[ Chuckles ]
[ Sniffles ]
There's gonna be some recovery time.
I'll have a place for us to stay by the time you're ready to leave here.
A place for us?
I'm gonna get your visa extended while you're in recovery.
It's gonna be a few weeks before you can really walk.
Till then, I thought I might apply for something...
A little more permanent.
How?
They said I could have my job back here at the E.R. if I wanted.
I thought maybe, um, if I could make it so that you could stay here with me...
Would you want that?
Remember when we read "Arabian nights,"
and you asked me, if I found a genie in a lamp who could Grant me three wishes, what would they be?
Yeah, I remember.
I told you I only had two.
Yeah, and you wouldn't tell me what they were.
What does the unluckiest girl in the world do when she wakes from a long sleep to find that she's been granted both her wishes in the same day?
[ Voice breaking ] I don't know.
She thanks grace.
[ Sighs ]
[ Sniffles ]
Hey.
What are you doing here?
Oh, I just got that patient into a deep-freeze pod at randor.
And now I have a shift.
Long day.
Man, those people are nuts.
They really believe all that crap.
I don't know.
We all have stuff we believe.
Heaven, the afterlife, reincarnation.
Everything someone believes in is gonna sound crazy to someone else.
That's pretty deep, Savetti.
Have a good shift.
¶¶
Um, is this the angels memorial service?
It is.
Are you here to pay your respects?
Uh, honestly, I, uh...
I don't know why I'm here.
Rollie:
Young squire.
Glad to see you could make it.
What are you doing here?
I come to all of these.
You're not the only one who needs to get right with God.
Hail Mary, full of grace.
The lord is with thee.
Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.
Holy Mary, mother of God, pray for us sinners, now...
Previously on "Code Black"...
Run, Malaya!
Run!
No, no, no, no, no!
Don't pull that knife!
Oh, my god.
I'm gonna kill that bitch.
Help me.
Help.
22-year-old female.
Pulmonary fibrosis.
Acute shortness of breath.
S.A.T.s in the 70s.
Center stage.
Prep an airway, Dr. Savetti.
Sir, what's her name, please?
Lizzie.
I'm her husband.
Please, Lizzie, hold on!
Call... them.
Call them.
No, no!
You're gonna be okay.
Right?
She's gonna be okay.
One, two, three.
Lizzie, I'm Dr. Guthrie.
Can you take in a deep breath for me?
Completely absent on the left.
Neck veins distended.
Tension's pneumo.
All right.
Quickly, let's do a finger thoracostomy.
- Got it.
- Chest tube second.
James... please.
We don't need them, Lizzie, okay?
You're gonna make it.
She's got like 20 scars here.
These are chest-tube scars.
Lung transplant?
Yeah, two.
Dear god, this poor child.
I'm okay.
No, she... she's strong.
I got air.
Get the chest tube in there, Dr. Savetti.
James... please.
No, I'm not doing this, okay?
You're gonna be fine!
Sir, you need to tell me what's going on.
I've planned a coordinated death if I die.
What does that mean?
She hired a cryogenics company to freeze her body if she dies.
So I'll be able to live again.
It's gonna be okay.
Hey.
Nobody told me you were coming in today.
I wasn't sure myself.
Well, I'm glad you did.
Dr. Pineda.
Can't tell you how good it is to see you here.
Let me know if you need anything, okay?
Angus, you're with me.
You okay?
Yep.
I mean about seeing Malaya.
Remember what I said, man.
You got to keep it together.
Just leave it alone, Mike, all right?
I'm Dr. Mike Leighton.
This is Dr. Angus Leighton.
You married or brothers?
Brothers.
You never know these days.
You've been having abdominal pain, vomiting?
We were on our way out when he just doubled over.
I'm fine.
Let me just go home.
Dad, stop being so stubborn.
Okay, stomach feels distended.
Dr. Leighton, bowel sounds?
B.P.'s a little low.
Temp 102.
Of all days for this to happen.
What do you think?
Concerning for obstruction.
Where were you guys headed?
A Valentine's day charity luncheon.
Odell Beckham's being honored.
Dad was his coach in high school.
His people sent us tickets.
He sent us tickets, Dad.
I'm a prop, that's all.
Dr. Leighton, what do you want to do?
Scan the belly for starters.
Good.
And a full sepsis work-up.
Coach...
Odell Beckham...
You must have done something right.
He came fully loaded.
I just counted the touchdowns.
We're gonna run some tests, see what we got.
Hey, careful of the tux.
It's a rental.
- Hey.
- Hey, yourself.
There's a patient inside.
The woman that brought her in is asking for you.
Her name is Grace Adams?
Grace?
She's here now?
Yeah.
She's wearing an Angels jacket.
Think she might work here.
No, no, she used to.
Used to work here.
Hm.
Grace.
Neal.
Hi.
This is Roseline.
Hello, Roseline.
How do you do?
I brought Roseline back with me from Port-au-Prince.
Grace spent the past year working with Operation Hope in Haiti.
Wow.
Good for you.
Thanks.
Roseline has a tumor on her spinal cord that's making it increasingly difficult for her to walk.
I brought her back on a tourist visa in hopes that I could get her the surgery that she needs.
You'll need Campbell for that, and he, uh...
Well, he won't be easy to convince.
Let's start with a CT scan and take it from there.
I'll order it now.
Thank you.
So, who's Grace?
Told you, she's a doctor who used to work here.
I know that.
I'm asking who she is to you.
- Synced and corrected by chamallow -
Shut up.
You've seen me in clothes before.
Not during a shift.
Oh, I don't know why I said yes to this.
I'm a doctor, not a whatever I am.
You're a doctor no matter what you're wearing.
If I'm gonna be here, I'd rather be in center stage.
What is that, a tamale?
For breakfast?
As my abuela Anita used to say,
"you wear the skin you're born in."
Yeah, but did she also mention that your heart has to live in there?
Forgive her, abuela, for she knows nada.
You don't have to believe.
You just have to be okay if I believe.
Lizzie, we've been through this 15 times before, and you've always come home.
It's not like the last 15 times.
James, this is different.
Is everything, uh, okay?
She wants me to get Randor here, the cryogenics company.
How's it work, anyway?
Freeze my brains and my vital organs.
- Snake oil.
- It's not snake oil.
I started a Kickstarter campaign to pay for it last year.
Doc, can you please just tell her that this is crazy?
I don't know anything about it, so...
You know my chances of surviving this, right?
Tell him that.
We don't give percentages here.
Well, then let me put it another way.
Is there a chance that she could live?
Of course.
But you need to believe that you can.
I do.
But...
I have a parachute in case I'm wrong.
Yeah.
She's only in the country this week.
She goes back to Haiti, where she's living in a refugee camp.
This is not an emergent case.
Why are we talking about this?
That's why we are talking about it, otherwise I would have just called someone to come down and pick her up.
We are asking for a favor.
It's a pretty big favor, Leanne.
The surgery alone will cost well into the six figures.
Who is she?
She's a little girl who needs our help.
I can throw a tennis ball off the roof of this hospital and hit about 30 little girls that need our help.
She's deteriorating, and we can help her.
You mean I can help her.
You want me to perform major surgery on a 13-year-old girl, and yet I don't see a pediatric referral, no pre-op work-up, no chest X-rays, EKGs, blood work.
Should I keep going?
All those tests and referrals take days.
She doesn't have that kind of time.
Her visa will run out.
Not my problem.
Frankly, I'm surprised at you, Leanne.
I'm sure you are.
He's an arrogant ass.
But he's not entirely wrong.
If she'd been hit by a bus and had come in by ambulance, she'd be in that O.R. right now, no questions asked.
Yeah, well, I guess she wasn't lucky enough to be hit by a bus.
You did the right thing coming here.
But it's normal for a new mom to feel rundown, especially after a c-section.
Still, this... this feels different than I expected.
I'm a marathon runner.
I was doing three miles a day a couple weeks before I gave birth to this little guy.
Your EKG was normal.
I'm short of breath, and something just feels wrong.
I...
I can't explain it.
It's...
it's more than just rundown.
We should get an X-ray, run some tests, make sure there's no infections or any other complications.
Is it okay if I bring him?
Well, you're gonna be in the X-ray machine for a while.
You have any family in the waiting area?
No.
No, I'm a...
I'm a single mom.
I di...
I didn't have anyone to ask.
We can hold him for you.
We can?
We'll take turns.
Okay.
Check the chest tube.
Did she pop her lung again?
No, there's condensation on them.
They're still working.
What's happening to her?
Sounds like fluid.
Okay.
Lizzie, listen to me.
We need to take action or you will die in minutes.
No.
Let me be.
Don't do anything.
No!
What?
!
Li...
Li...
She'll make it through this.
She always does.
James, let me go.
What?
No!
Lizzie, don't...
Don't give up, okay?
Don't give up.
- Look, they're gonna fix you.
- It's time.
No!
It's not time, all right?
They're gonna fix you.
They're gonna... they're gonna make you better, okay?
James, I'm not so sure if...
Lizzie!
Don't give up, honey, all right?
Please, please don't give up, all right?
You're gonna make it.
You're gonna make it.
They're gonna make you better.
They're gonna fix you, all right?
Please?
All right.
Let's go.
What happened?
He was in a lot of pain, then I think he fainted.
His abdomen is rock-hard.
I need more N.S. and levophed.
He's septic.
Did you get the sepsis work-up?
- Not yet.
- "Not yet"?
Damn it, Angus.
How's his IVC?
Collapsed.
The tank is low.
What's he on?
Vanc, Zosyn, and four liters of N.S. so far.
Systolic is 50.
M.A.P. of 40.
He's gonna arrest.
Let's get him to center stage.
Come here.
We can't give up on Roseline.
You heard Campbell.
Even Leanne doesn't think it's possible.
What do you want me to do?
Look behind God's curtain.
Sorry?
That's what you used to say about surgery.
That it was like seeing behind god's curtain.
I was flirting.
No, you weren't.
Come on.
We've never let anything stop us before.
Grace, there's no us.
You're still mad.
What did you expect?
That you'd drop in here and we'd just pick up where we left off?
I never meant to hurt you, Neal.
You found someone else.
After you and I were over.
Fine.
Whatever you think of me...
Please don't take it out on this sweet little girl.
You know me better than that.
In a lot of ways, I think I know you better than anyone.
No.
No, you don't.
Okay, Angus, focus.
He needs a high line.
You got it?
Angus, your attending asked you a question.
Yes.
Yes.
I've got the Levophed up.
Watch from here, okay?
I'll start another line on the right.
Guys, she's satting in the 70s.
Can't wait anymore.
We need to intubate.
What does that mean?
We have to put her in a coma so we can put a breathing tube in.
Sux and etomidate, Dr. Guthrie?
Yes.
Have them ready, please.
Wait!
Um... her... her transplant surgeon said that if she goes on a breathing machine, she might never come off of it.
I'm sorry, but there's no other way.
There may be another way.
Lizzie, can you squeeze my hand?
She is still responding to commands.
- We could try BiPAP.
- Wha... what's that?
It's a machine that helps her breathe through a mask, not a tube.
But she has to be able to work with the machine.
If she can, it could help clear the fluid in her lungs and save her.
Yes.
Uh, right, honey?
Yes, we... we want this.
Let's do it now, Dr. Savetti.
I got maybe 40 over palp.
He's in cardiopulmonary collapse.
We got to attack this.
More fluids.
His mean arterial pressure was always above 65.
I didn't think he'd reach sepsis so fast.
Did you check other measures of profusion?
Of course.
- Urine output?
- Low.
- Lactate?
- High.
Look, I could not have predicted that this would happen so fast.
Come on.
Angus, you in on your line?
Make sure the ICU is notified.
Angus?
!
Angus, you have a patient in distress.
Get those fluids in now.
We got this, Dr. Rorish.
Doesn't look like it to me.
Titrating levo now.
Okay.
B.P. rising.
90 over 60.
Angus, I don't know where your head is, but in this room, you've got one focus, and that's your patient.
Clear?
Dr. Rorish, can we talk, please?
Angus, take a break.
I'm the resident director now, and he's a resident.
So by definition, I direct the residents.
And I'm the director of the E.R., which means I direct you.
But by inserting yourself like that, you undermine my authority.
Do you have authority over your brother?
That's my problem.
Let me ask you, honestly, would you have ever tolerated anything like that from Taylor or Perello when you had this job?
Look, I think we're both just trying to figure out how to put on these new uniforms and make them fit.
You're doing great, Lizzie.
When you breathe in, the machine feels it and pushes air to help your lungs.
Someone from Randor Cryogenics called.
They're pulling into the ambulance bay.
You called them?
So, y... you just agreed to all this until they could get here?
Y... you're... you're giving up.
I'm not giving up.
Lizzie, I need you to believe that you can live.
I need you to believe that this will work.
I am gonna live.
Just not now.
50 years ago, no one could have imagined smartphones, the Internet... or salted chocolate.
And 50 years from now, you'll wake me up, and we'll be together again.
In 50 years, I'll be 75.
75 will be the new 20.
I'm gonna have to show you how everything works.
They'll have a program that'll download everything I need to know right into my brain.
Well, you always wanted to learn how to play saxophone.
Next time I see you, I'll play it for you.
And then we can... we can go have dinner on the Moon.
You hate the cold.
I'll, um...
I'll check back in on her in a little bit.
Hey.
I thought you were off today.
You're from Randor.
The cryo people?
So, does your boyfriend Campbell know you work for a cryogenics company?
Yes, and now the two of you have something in common...
- He doesn't approve, either.
- But it's allowed?
I can whatever the hell I want on my days off.
It's a job.
Dude...
Don't "dude" me.
I have over $250,000 in student-loan debts.
Randor pays me 30k.
To operate on dead bodies.
To prepare them for freezing.
You do know this is crazy, right?
Insane.
But who cares?
Clients are happy, nobody gets hurt, and I get paid.
My people are here.
Your people?
Well, two nurses.
I got to go fill out paperwork to release the body when she dies.
You'll get over it.
I knew it was gonna be a challenge having him on my own, but I... you know,
I thought I'd have a little time to ramp into it.
When he smiles back at you, you'll know it's all worth it.
Uh, did my test results come back?
Yes.
They're good.
Malaya has the results.
Malaya?
Of course.
Sorry.
We saw a post-op atelectasis...
A post-op what?
It sounds much worse than it is.
It's a partial collapsing of your lung.
An area of your left lung wasn't inflating properly, which explains your oxygen levels.
We don't think you have anything to worry about.
You're sure?
You should take it easy for a couple days, but you're fine.
I'll start the discharge paperwork.
I'm not even gonna ask you how you got this MRI.
Look at the tumor.
It could kill Roseline, Leanne.
Yeah, I'm sympathetic, but the fact is it's not killing her right now.
You're hiding behind semantics.
- Grace.
- No.
The Leanne I remember wouldn't hesitate to take this on.
You're not helping, Grace.
Even if I supported you, Campbell refused.
You'd need a surgeon to sign on, and it'd have to be someone who is willing to go up against Campbell.
You two been talking?
No.
That's the universe talking.
Neal, has it ever occurred to you that maybe you've run so far from your father that you've run right past yourself?
When was the last time you had your prostate checked, Mr. Delaney?
Dad?
A year ago.
They told me I had prostate cancer.
What?
Y... y... you've known for a y... y... a year?
I heard prostate cancer was a slow grower.
I was just trying to figure out what to do.
Um... unfortunately, your cancer wasn't so slow.
The tumor ended up perforating the colon.
We need to do surgery now... a total colectomy.
What the hell is that?
We have to remove your entire large intestine.
Oh, my god.
And what's left for me when you're done?
Your life.
It won't be without complications.
I would imagine that.
W... what complications?
Urinary-tract issues, impotence...
Can we not talk about this now?
No, I am done with secrets.
So, he... he's gonna need a... a colostomy bag?
Yeah.
You want me to crap in a bag?
Hell no.
They told me I cou...
I could get, uh, chemo.
And... and radiation, they said.
It's too late for that.
What would we do?
What's next?
Nothing's next.
I'm not doing it.
No!
This is not up to you.
I'm not dead yet.
And until I am, it is up to me.
The answer... is no.
Seems like you got a lot left to live for, Mr. Delaney.
Why would I disrupt trauma-one by taking away one of its best doctors while simultaneously pissing off the director of the O.R.?
Because it's the best of both worlds.
May I?
How so?
The position is for a surgical attending who covers the emergency department.
That's what Cole Guthrie did.
Who better to cover trauma-one than someone who's spent his whole career working there?
Katie Miller says she still doesn't feel good.
I don't have any reason to hold her, but I don't feel right sending her home.
I mean, all alone with a new baby...
Thank you for talking to me about work and not asking me how I'm doing.
Be patient.
Trust me, you'll be surprised at how much you can endure, and how strong you actually are.
I'm sure you're right.
Wait a second.
Katie's heart rate was normal, right?
90.
A little high, but in the margin.
No, no, no, no, no.
Not if she's a marathon runner.
Normal is probably in the 40s for her.
P.E.?
Oh, god.
I got vitals.
I'll wire her up.
What's going on?
We just have to check something.
Have a seat.
Sats have dropped.
I'm getting worse?
I thought you said I was gonna be okay.
That's what we thought, but your oxygen levels are low.
We're gonna put you on something called an NRB mask.
It delivers high-concentration oxygen to your lungs.
Your symptoms could suggest a pulmonary embolism...
A clot in your lungs.
That would explain the elevated heart rate.
But I'm gonna be all right?
We need to get a CT scan right away to confirm whether it is a clot.
Ready?
What are you doing, Dr. Hudson?
Dr. Harbert approved my transfer to the surgical department.
He told me.
Congratulations.
However, the question remains.
What are you doing?
I'm... scheduling my patient's surgery.
This is still my department.
That means I assign your resident, your surgical nurses, your anesthesiologist, and your O.R.
Welcome to my team, Dr. Hudson.
Hand me my phone, please.
I want to check the scores.
Mom always said you were more stubborn than a constipated mule.
Yeah, well, Mom isn't around anymore, is she?
Ohh, you didn't.
Odell Beckham!
That's Odell.
Hey, Mia.
Long time no see.
Odell!
How you doing, Coach?
Odell, please talk some sense into him.
You always were a smartass kid, you know that?
Where'd you get that jacket, man?
Michael Jackson's closet.
Yeah, yeah!
So, he still won't let you operate?
I'm sorry, Grace.
No, I'm sorry you made a major life decision for this only to have...
That's not why I made it.
It's just what precipitated it.
Excuse me, Dr. Adams, is the girl in the family room with you?
- Yes, why?
- You better come quick.
I went to bring her a book, and I found her seizing on the floor.
Let's get her on oxygen, please.
Okay, open your mouth.
Let's move her.
Let's move her.
Grace, what's her baseline blood pressure?
- She runs low. 90s over 70s.
- That's the tumor keeping it low.
- B.P. now 170 over 80.
- That's better, right?
- No, it's worse.
- No, it's worse.
She's in autonomic dysreflexia.
Her pressure can swing wildly from high to low as a result of the tumor.
And relative to her baseline, it's way too high.
Let's sit her up and get her legs underneath her, try and get her pressure down.
If we don't lower it, she could stroke out.
Christa, nicardipine.
Five milligrams an hour.
Got it.
I'll get the piggyback pump.
Oh!
Okay.
Ohh, oh, oh, oh.
We can't wait for the nicardipine drip.
10 of labetalol, please.
Push, not drip!
- Roseline...
- Pushing 10 of labetalol now.
Vitals stable.
Thank god.
Neal, it's time.
You ready for this?
Campbell isn't gonna budge, Leanne.
Whether it's tumor or edema, she's getting worse.
It's emergent now.
She could die.
Protocol is on our side now.
Let's get her upstairs.
Hey, hey.
Hey, Doc.
You know who this guy is?
Who doesn't?
Mr. Beckham, it's a real pleasure.
Thank you for helping me win my fantasy league two years in a row.
Where's my check?
You should've seen this guy when he first walked on the field.
He was catching balls with one hand the first day of practice.
I told anybody that'd listen that he was one of the greats.
Let's me and you talk, Coach.
Thank you for doing this.
I'm glad I can.
Grace...
Why Roseline?
What do you mean?
There must have been hundreds of girls in that camp.
Why this one?
A long time ago, there was another little girl.
She was smart.
In fact, they put her in classes with kids a lot older than her.
The kids laughed at her because she came to school with her own stepladder.
A stepladder?
She was too little for the blackboard.
She wanted to make sure that if she was called upon, she could reach it.
That was you.
It's also her.
I wanted to learn.
Nothing was gonna stop me.
I'm not gonna let anything stop her, either.
Lizzie?
Lizzie!
What happened?
She lost pulses while on BiPAP.
Lizzie, honey, it's okay.
I'm...
I'm right here.
It's been four minutes.
Okay, let's do a pulse check.
Come back to me, Lizzie.
Please, just fight.
Call it.
What?
What?
W... w... what's going on?
W... what are you...
Mario.
I can't do anything until you call it.
Time of death... 4:15.
No!
Lizzie!
Oh.
Oh.
They're with me.
I believe, Lizzie.
I believe, okay?
I love you.
And I'm gonna see you again, because I believe.
Pulmonary embolism.
Good catch.
What do you want to do?
You could give her alteplase, bust up the clot.
But that risks a hemorrhage of the c-section.
Dr. Rorish, you have a sec?
38-year-old female, pulmonary embolism in the right lung.
Vitals stable.
Elevated resting heart rate, and she's a new mom by a c-section.
You debating alteplase?
- How many days post-op?
- Four.
She could bleed out.
But if you wait, the saddle embolism could kill her.
So, what should we do?
I'd take the risk and do the alteplase now.
But talk to the patient.
Let her make an informed decision.
That's our recommendation, but the decision has to be yours.
When I was... going through IVF, my mother asked me what would happen to him if something ever happened to me.
I thought she was just being unsupportive.
She thought what I was doing was selfish.
And maybe it was.
But I wanted a second chapter.
We're all entitled to that.
And then this little guy came along.
Turns out the chapter was being written by him, not me.
I want to live.
I still tell people about that Eastern game.
Last quarter, down five, clock running out.
He hasn't changed my mind.
Not what I was hoping to hear.
We need to get you to surgery now.
They had you, uh, double-covered with the safety over the top.
Somehow, you... you outran the coverage...
Coach and took it to the house.
Coach!
I'd never seen anybody get so much air.
Coach.
- And they held you...
- Coach.
What?
!
You're just gonna keep talking, huh?
The more I talk, the less I have to listen to you trying to convince me to go under the knife.
- You need the surgery.
- Why?
Because if you don't, you'll die.
- Maybe I'm okay with that.
- That's selfish.
You never taught me about giving up,
- and now you're giving up on us?
- Beth left me.
Mrs. Coach.
Remember?
I mean, can you believe that after all these years?
She just decided she had enough of me.
We were supposed to spend our last, best years together, now I got nothing.
You have Mia.
I don't want to be a burden on her.
Coach, you taught me never take your losses into the next game.
Ever.
Good advice.
And what if it doesn't work?
What... what if I put her through all this and I'm still dead?
Then I'll give a beautiful speech at the funeral.
I'll let them all know that I would never be here without you.
You teached me how to have courage, play with grit, stay persistent.
We need to get this done.
I mean, literally, I have this...
This weird sensation where I look at my hands, but...
They're not my hands.
You know what I mean?
One thing's for certain.
It is definitely going to get better.
You sure about that?
Absolutely.
Well, that didn't take long.
Welcome back.
Malaya.
It's good to see you back again.
You're worried about her.
In my experience, we heal better from the things that are done to us than the things that we do to others.
What does that mean?
My mother used to call it "getting right with God."
Now, you don't have to tell me anything that you don't want to, but that doesn't mean that I can't make a suggestion.
That man, the one who hurt our people, is still here.
His body is in the morgue, unclaimed.
Every other Saturday, the hospital buries all the unclaimed bodies in white oak cemetery.
After what he did, you... you want me to go pay my respects to him?
I didn't suggest that you go for him, young squire.
I got O.B. and blood bank standing by.
Joshua's in the nursery having his bottle.
Okay.
We ready to do this?
You know who to call if this all goes wrong.
Nothing's gonna go wrong.
But, yes.
I promise I will look after him until your mother arrives.
God.
I didn't go through three rounds of IVF to have my crazy mother raise him.
This has to work.
Okay.
Jesse, hand the syringe to Malaya.
- You got this?
- Yeah.
You should begin to feel better immediately if it works the way we think it will, okay?
How are you feeling, Katie?
No different yet.
All right, breathe normally for me.
Oxygen climbing.
Oh.
Oh, I can feel it.
Oh, my god.
Easy, calm breaths.
Oh, I can breathe!
Yeah.
Easy.
It worked!
Deep breaths.
Calm.
Oh.
What... what?
What... what's happening?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- B.P.'s crashing, guys.
Jesse, get me a surgical tray.
Alert O.B.
Call in a verbal for blood and platelets.
We've got to re-open the c-section until O.B. gets here.
Most of the bulk of the tumor is resected now.
Almost done?
Unfortunately, that's, uh, a rather big "almost."
You see this structure here?
That's the anterior spinal artery.
And you see this gray, shiny stuff?
Those are the bad cells that are literally eating into the artery.
There is one piece.
100 more to go.
That's a defeating thought.
Oh, no.
Neal.
It's okay.
This can happen.
Pass me the hemostat, and get me a 5-0.
Come on.
Come on.
Damn.
More suction.
Damn.
Give me a 4-0.
Okay.
Suction, please, Nurse.
Get this in.
Is everything okay?
What's wrong?
No.
Damn it.
Get me a Kelly.
More suction.
No.
Another 4-0, please.
Damn it, damn it, damn it.
Her blood pressure is plummeting.
Hang another two units, wide open.
Grace, I need help.
What do you need me to do?
- Get Campbell.
- What?
Campbell?
Yeah, he's done thousands of these.
Please, just get him.
Get him now.
Forceps and hemostat now.
Suction.
I clamped the anterior spinal artery...
I can see what you did.
Nurse, suture, please.
Suction.
One more suture, please.
You can come down off the blood now.
The bleeding has stopped.
Let me help with that flap.
Dr. Hudson, that's enough.
It's my case now.
You can go.
You don't want the help of another surgeon?
Is there one around?
It's okay.
O.B.'s on the way.
Blood bank's sending down a six-pack.
Tocin is up.
She's gonna need more sutures.
Oh, god.
She has a son upstairs.
We told her to do this.
Malaya, calm down.
Take a deep breath.
I can't do this.
Dr. Pineda!
Get back here right now.
This is your patient.
Dr. Pineda, look at me and listen to my voice.
Your patient's bleeding is similar to a postpartum hemorrhage.
Okay?
There's no one bleed source.
It's the whole uterus leaking blood.
So what do we do?
Should I get a...
No.
Stay right there.
What do we do for postpartum hemorrhaging?
Um, uh, we... we try to induce contractions.
Yes.
Good.
Now get over here.
I need your hands.
Okay, Dr. Lorenson, clamp that vessel, please.
Jesse, resect the skin.
You see that?
Right there.
That's the uterus.
Now, both of you get your hands in there.
Now, what happens when we massage the uterus directly?
It contracts.
Stopping the bleeding.
Good.
Yes.
Keep massaging.
Apply pressure, be firm.
Here, Jesse.
Thank you, Dr. Rorish.
A Foley?
Yep.
All right, Dr. Lorenson, insert that catheter into the uterus.
We're gonna keep kneading the uterus while you inflate it.
Malaya, you've got a nurse waiting for your order.
Jesse, blood and fluids wide open, please.
Yes, Doctor.
Is it working?
B.P.'s 90 over 80.
Bleeding is slowing down.
It's working.
You bet it is.
All right.
Let's pack these wounds, get her to an O.R.
Okay, guys.
Come on.
Let's go.
Pack it up.
Yeah, so, you know, on my block,
I was, like, the leftie, you know?
I always used to get picked first, so... that was my thing.
Mm-hmm.
Hey, uh... oh, oh.
Odell, this is little Joshua.
Hold him for a second.
Be right back.
Don't drop him, buddy.
Okay.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Easy.
Okay.
Leanne!
Leanne, Leanne, Leanne.
Odell Beckham.
Greatest catch in NFL history.
Hey.
You changed back into your scrubs.
What's up?
You got to wear the skin you're born in, mama.
Leanne.
You set me up.
How so?
You forgot to mention, when you asked me to meet with Neal, that the real reason he wanted the job was so he could perform an unapproved surgery on an undocumented alien minor.
That wasn't the only reason, and the surgery was approved.
Nonetheless, I'd like to know the motives of the people I hire.
Then you ought to try to get to know us better.
If you knew me at all, you would know I have to do this job my way.
Is that what the, uh...
The scrubs are all about?
It's a start.
Have a good day, Doctor.
How you feeling?
So good I want to crap my pants.
But I guess those days are over.
At least you have a sense of humor.
I don't.
Odell does.
He's out in the waiting room signing his 400th autograph right now.
Hey, you said earlier that he invited you to his charity event as a prop.
Yeah.
You want to know why he really invited you, Mr. Delaney?
His speech is on the Internet, and here's what he said...
"A great man once told me that temperament is displayed in failure, but character is revealed in success.
Pete Delaney taught me that."
Pete Delaney taught me how to win.
He also taught me how to be a winner.
You remember that?
I remember everything you taught me, Coach.
Every single thing.
You got your camera?
Come on.
One for posterity.
Here we go.
You fought like a...
A warrior?
Like a mom.
Aww.
Hi.
Hey, you.
Hi.
How did I do?
It worked, Roseline.
There's gonna be some recovery time.
I'll have a place for us to stay by the time you're ready to leave here.
A place for us?
I'm gonna get your visa extended while you're in recovery.
It's gonna be a few weeks before you can really walk.
Till then, I thought I might apply for something... a little more permanent.
How?
They said I could have my job back here at the E.R. if I wanted.
I thought maybe, um, if I could make it so that you could stay here with me...
Would you want that?
Remember when we read "Arabian Nights,"
and you asked me, if I found a genie in a lamp who could grant me three wishes, what would they be?
Yeah, I remember.
I told you I only had two.
Yeah, and you wouldn't tell me what they were.
What does the unluckiest girl in the world do when she wakes from a long sleep to find that she's been granted both her wishes in the same day?
I don't know.
She thanks Grace.
Hey.
What are you doing here?
Oh, I just got that patient into a deep-freeze pod at Randor.
And now I have a shift.
Long day.
Man, those people are nuts.
They really believe all that crap.
I know.
We all have stuff we believe.
Heaven, the afterlife, reincarnation.
Everything someone believes in is gonna sound crazy to someone else.
That's pretty deep, Savetti.
Have a good shift.
Um, is this the Angels memorial service?
It is.
Are you here to pay your respects?
Uh, honestly, I, uh...
I don't know why I'm here.
Young squire.
Glad to see you could make it.
What are you doing here?
I come to all of these.
You're not the only one who needs to get right with god.
Hail Mary, full of grace.
The Lord is with thee.
Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.
Holy Mary, mother of God, pray for us sinners, now...
- Synced and corrected by chamallow -
- Previously on "Code Black"...
- [Screams]
Run, Malaya!
Run!
No, no, no, no, no!
Don't pull that knife!
Oh, my god.
I'm gonna kill that bitch.
[Gagging]
Help me.
Help.
[Siren wailing]
[Radio chatter]
[Doors opening, closing]
[Gurney clatters]
22-year-old female.
Pulmonary fibrosis.
Acute shortness of breath.
S.A.T.s in the 70s.
Center stage.
Prep an airway, Dr. Savetti.
Sir, what's her name, please?
Lizzie.
I'm her husband.
Please, Lizzie, hold on!
[Gasping] Call... them.
Call them.
No, no!
You're gonna be okay.
Right?
She's gonna be okay.
[Indistinct chatter]
Rollie:
One, two, three.
Lizzie, I'm Dr. Guthrie.
Can you take in a deep breath for me?
[Gasping]
Completely absent on the left.
Neck veins distended.
Tension's pneumo.
All right.
Quickly, let's do a finger thoracostomy.
- Got it.
- Chest tube second.
James... please.
We don't need them, Lizzie, okay?
You're gonna make it.
[Gasping]
[Coughing] She's got like 20 scars here.
These are chest-tube scars.
Lung transplant?
Yeah, two.
Dear god, this poor child.
I'm okay.
No, she... she's strong.
[Gasping]
I got air.
Get the chest tube in there, Dr. Savetti.
James... please.
No, I'm not doing this, okay?
You're gonna be fine!
Sir, you need to tell me what's going on.
I've planned a coordinated death if I die.
What does that mean?
She hired a cryogenics company to freeze her body if she dies.
So I'll be able to live again.
It's gonna be okay.
Angus:
Hey.
Nobody told me you were coming in today.
I wasn't sure myself.
Well, I'm glad you did.
Mike:
Dr. Pineda.
Can't tell you how good it is to see you here.
Let me know if you need anything, okay?
Angus, you're with me.
You okay?
Yep.
I mean about seeing Malaya.
Remember what I said, man.
You got to keep it together.
Just leave it alone, Mike, all right?
I'm Dr. Mike Leighton.
This is Dr. Angus Leighton.
You married or brothers?
Brothers.
You never know these days.
You've been having abdominal pain, vomiting?
We were on our way out when he just doubled over.
I'm fine.
Let me just go home.
Dad, stop being so stubborn.
Okay, stomach feels distended.
Dr. Leighton, bowel sounds?
B.P.'s a little low.
Temp 102.
Of all days for this to happen.
What do you think?
Concerning for obstruction.
Where were you guys headed?
A Valentine's day charity luncheon.
Odell Beckham's being honored.
Dad was his coach in high school.
His people sent us tickets.
He sent us tickets, Dad.
I'm a prop, that's all.
Dr. Leighton, what do you want to do?
Scan the belly for starters.
Good.
And a full sepsis work-up.
Coach...
Odell Beckham...
You must have done something right.
He came fully loaded.
I just counted the touchdowns.
We're gonna run some tests, see what we got.
Hey, careful of the tux.
It's a rental.
- Hey.
- Hey, yourself.
There's a patient inside.
The woman that brought her in is asking for you.
Her name is Grace Adams?
Grace?
She's here now?
Yeah.
She's wearing an Angels jacket.
Think she might work here.
No, no, she used to.
Used to work here.
Hm.
[Curtain opens]
Grace.
Neal.
Hi.
This is Roseline.
Hello, Roseline.
How do you do?
[Chuckles]
I brought Roseline back with me from Port-au-Prince.
Grace spent the past year working with Operation Hope in Haiti.
Wow.
Good for you.
Thanks.
Roseline has a tumor on her spinal cord that's making it increasingly difficult for her to walk.
I brought her back on a tourist visa in hopes that I could get her the surgery that she needs.
You'll need Campbell for that, and he, uh...
Well, he won't be easy to convince.
Let's start with a CT scan and take it from there.
I'll order it now.
Thank you.
So, who's Grace?
Told you, she's a doctor who used to work here.
I know that.
I'm asking who she is to you.
[Door opens]
Shut up.
You've seen me in clothes before.
Not during a shift.
Oh, I don't know why I said yes to this.
I'm a doctor, not a whatever I am.
You're a doctor no matter what you're wearing.
If I'm gonna be here, I'd rather be in center stage.
What is that, a tamale?
For breakfast?
As my abuela Anita used to say,
"you wear the skin you're born in."
Yeah, but did she also mention that your heart has to live in there?
Forgive her, abuela, for she knows nada.
You don't have to believe.
You just have to be okay if I believe.
Lizzie, we've been through this 15 times before, and you've always come home.
It's not like the last 15 times.
James, this is different.
Is everything, uh, okay?
She wants me to get Randor here, the cryogenics company.
How's it work, anyway?
Freeze my brains and my vital organs.
- Snake oil.
- It's not snake oil.
I started a Kickstarter campaign to pay for it last year.
Doc, can you please just tell her that this is crazy?
I don't know anything about it, so...
You know my chances of surviving this, right?
Tell him that.
We don't give percentages here.
Well, then let me put it another way.
Is there a chance that she could live?
Of course.
But you need to believe that you can.
I do.
But...
I have a parachute in case I'm wrong.
Yeah.
Neal:
She's only in the country this week.
She goes back to Haiti, where she's living in a refugee camp.
This is not an emergent case.
Why are we talking about this?
That's why we are talking about it, otherwise I would have just called someone to come down and pick her up.
We are asking for a favor.
It's a pretty big favor, Leanne.
The surgery alone will cost well into the six figures.
Who is she?
She's a little girl who needs our help.
I can throw a tennis ball off the roof of this hospital and hit about 30 little girls that need our help.
She's deteriorating, and we can help her.
You mean I can help her.
You want me to perform major surgery on a 13-year-old girl, and yet I don't see a pediatric referral, no pre-op work-up, no chest X-rays, EKGs, blood work.
Should I keep going?
All those tests and referrals take days.
She doesn't have that kind of time.
Her visa will run out.
Not my problem.
Frankly, I'm surprised at you, Leanne.
I'm sure you are.
He's an arrogant ass.
But he's not entirely wrong.
If she'd been hit by a bus and had come in by ambulance, she'd be in that O.R. right now, no questions asked.
Yeah, well, I guess she wasn't lucky enough to be hit by a bus.
Christa:
You did the right thing coming here.
But it's normal for a new mom to feel rundown, especially after a c-section.
Still, this... this feels different than I expected.
I'm a marathon runner.
I was doing three miles a day a couple weeks before I gave birth to this little guy.
Your EKG was normal.
I'm short of breath, and something just feels wrong.
I...
I can't explain it.
It's...
it's more than just rundown.
We should get an X-ray, run some tests, make sure there's no infections or any other complications.
Is it okay if I bring him?
Well, you're gonna be in the X-ray machine for a while.
You have any family in the waiting area?
No.
No, I'm a...
I'm a single mom.
I di...
I didn't have anyone to ask.
We can hold him for you.
We can?
We'll take turns.
[Coos]
Okay.
[Gasping, coughs]
Check the chest tube.
Did she pop her lung again?
No, there's condensation on them.
They're still working.
What's happening to her?
Sounds like fluid.
Okay.
Lizzie, listen to me.
We need to take action or you will die in minutes.
No.
Let me be.
Don't do anything.
No!
What?
!
Li...
Li...
She'll make it through this.
She always does.
James, let me go.
What?
No!
Lizzie, don't...
Don't give up, okay?
Don't give up.
- Look, they're gonna fix you.
- It's time.
No!
It's not time, all right?
They're gonna fix you.
They're gonna... they're gonna make you better, okay?
James, I'm not so sure if...
Lizzie!
Don't give up, honey, all right?
Please, please don't give up, all right?
You're gonna make it.
You're gonna make it.
They're gonna make you better.
They're gonna fix you, all right?
Please?
All right.
Let's go.
[Gasping]
[Monitor beeping]
Angus:
What happened?
He was in a lot of pain, then I think he fainted.
His abdomen is rock-hard.
I need more N.S. and levophed.
He's septic.
Did you get the sepsis work-up?
- Not yet.
- "Not yet"?
Damn it, Angus.
How's his IVC?
Collapsed.
The tank is low.
What's he on?
Vanc, Zosyn, and four liters of N.S. so far.
[Rapid beeping]
Systolic is 50.
M.A.P. of 40.
He's gonna arrest.
Let's get him to center stage.
Come here.
We can't give up on Roseline.
You heard Campbell.
Even Leanne doesn't think it's possible.
What do you want me to do?
Look behind God's curtain.
Sorry?
That's what you used to say about surgery.
That it was like seeing behind god's curtain.
I was flirting.
No, you weren't.
[Chuckles]
Come on.
We've never let anything stop us before.
Grace, there's no us.
You're still mad.
What did you expect?
That you'd drop in here and we'd just pick up where we left off?
I never meant to hurt you, Neal.
You found someone else.
After you and I were over.
Fine.
Whatever you think of me...
Please don't take it out on this sweet little girl.
You know me better than that.
In a lot of ways, I think I know you better than anyone.
No.
No, you don't.
Okay, Angus, focus.
He needs a high line.
You got it?
Angus, your attending asked you a question.
Yes.
Yes.
I've got the Levophed up.
Watch from here, okay?
I'll start another line on the right.
Jesse:
Guys, she's satting in the 70s.
Can't wait anymore.
We need to intubate.
What does that mean?
We have to put her in a coma so we can put a breathing tube in.
Sux and etomidate, Dr. Guthrie?
Yes.
Have them ready, please.
Wait!
Um... her... her transplant surgeon said that if she goes on a breathing machine, she might never come off of it.
I'm sorry, but there's no other way.
There may be another way.
Lizzie, can you squeeze my hand?
She is still responding to commands.
- We could try BiPAP.
- James:
Wha... what's that?
It's a machine that helps her breathe through a mask, not a tube.
But she has to be able to work with the machine.
If she can, it could help clear the fluid in her lungs and save her.
Yes.
Uh, right, honey?
Yes, we... we want this.
Let's do it now, Dr. Savetti.
I got maybe 40 over palp.
Mike:
He's in cardiopulmonary collapse.
We got to attack this.
More fluids.
His mean arterial pressure was always above 65.
I didn't think he'd reach sepsis so fast.
Did you check other measures of profusion?
Of course.
- Urine output?
- Low.
- Lactate?
- High.
Look, I could not have predicted that this would happen so fast.
Come on.
Angus, you in on your line?
Man:
Make sure the ICU is notified.
Angus?
!
Angus, you have a patient in distress.
Get those fluids in now.
We got this, Dr. Rorish.
Doesn't look like it to me.
Titrating levo now.
Risa:
Okay.
B.P. rising.
90 over 60.
Angus, I don't know where your head is, but in this room, you've got one focus, and that's your patient.
Clear?
Dr. Rorish, can we talk, please?
Angus, take a break.
I'm the resident director now, and he's a resident.
So by definition, I direct the residents.
And I'm the director of the E.R., which means I direct you.
But by inserting yourself like that, you undermine my authority.
Do you have authority over your brother?
That's my problem.
Let me ask you, honestly, would you have ever tolerated anything like that from Taylor or Perello when you had this job?
Look, I think we're both just trying to figure out how to put on these new uniforms and make them fit.
Mario:
You're doing great, Lizzie.
When you breathe in, the machine feels it and pushes air to help your lungs.
Woman:
Someone from Randor Cryogenics called.
They're pulling into the ambulance bay.
You called them?
So, y... you just agreed to all this until they could get here?
Y... you're... you're giving up.
I'm not giving up.
Lizzie, I need you to believe that you can live.
I need you to believe that this will work.
I am gonna live.
Just not now.
[Breathes deeply] 50 years ago, no one could have imagined smartphones, the Internet... or salted chocolate.
[Chuckles, sniffles]
And 50 years from now, you'll wake me up, and we'll be together again.
In 50 years, I'll be 75.
[Laughs, coughs] 75 will be the new 20.
[Chuckles]
I'm gonna have to show you how everything works.
[Sniffles]
They'll have a program that'll download everything I need to know right into my brain.
Well, you always wanted to learn how to play saxophone.
[Coughs]
Next time I see you, I'll play it for you.
[Chuckles]
And then we can... we can go have dinner on the Moon.
[Chuckles]
You hate the cold.
I'll, um...
I'll check back in on her in a little bit.
Hey.
I thought you were off today.
You're from Randor.
The cryo people?
So, does your boyfriend Campbell know you work for a cryogenics company?
Yes, and now the two of you have something in common...
- He doesn't approve, either.
- But it's allowed?
I can whatever the hell I want on my days off.
It's a job.
Dude...
Don't "dude" me.
I have over $250,000 in student-loan debts.
Randor pays me 30k.
To operate on dead bodies.
To prepare them for freezing.
You do know this is crazy, right?
Insane.
But who cares?
Clients are happy, nobody gets hurt, and I get paid.
[Pager beeps]
My people are here.
Your people?
Well, two nurses.
I got to go fill out paperwork to release the body when she dies.
[Sighs]
You'll get over it.
I knew it was gonna be a challenge having him on my own, but I... you know,
I thought I'd have a little time to ramp into it.
When he smiles back at you, you'll know it's all worth it.
Uh, did my test results come back?
Yes.
They're good.
Malaya has the results.
Malaya?
Of course.
Sorry.
We saw a post-op atelectasis...
A post-op what?
It sounds much worse than it is.
It's a partial collapsing of your lung.
An area of your left lung wasn't inflating properly, which explains your oxygen levels.
We don't think you have anything to worry about.
You're sure?
You should take it easy for a couple days, but you're fine.
I'll start the discharge paperwork.
I'm not even gonna ask you how you got this MRI.
Look at the tumor.
It could kill Roseline, Leanne.
Yeah, I'm sympathetic, but the fact is it's not killing her right now.
You're hiding behind semantics.
- Grace.
- No.
The Leanne I remember wouldn't hesitate to take this on.
You're not helping, Grace.
Even if I supported you, Campbell refused.
You'd need a surgeon to sign on, and it'd have to be someone who is willing to go up against Campbell.
You two been talking?
No.
That's the universe talking.
Neal, has it ever occurred to you that maybe you've run so far from your father that you've run right past yourself?
When was the last time you had your prostate checked, Mr. Delaney?
Dad?
A year ago.
They told me I had prostate cancer.
What?
Y... y... you've known for a y... y... a year?
I heard prostate cancer was a slow grower.
I was just trying to figure out what to do.
Um... unfortunately, your cancer wasn't so slow.
The tumor ended up perforating the colon.
We need to do surgery now... a total colectomy.
What the hell is that?
We have to remove your entire large intestine.
Oh, my god.
And what's left for me when you're done?
Your life.
It won't be without complications.
I would imagine that.
W... what complications?
Urinary-tract issues, impotence...
Can we not talk about this now?
No, I am done with secrets.
[Sighs]
So, he... he's gonna need a... a colostomy bag?
Yeah.
You want me to crap in a bag?
Hell no.
They told me I cou...
I could get, uh, chemo.
And... and radiation, they said.
It's too late for that.
What would we do?
What's next?
Nothing's next.
I'm not doing it.
No!
This is not up to you.
I'm not dead yet.
And until I am, it is up to me.
The answer... is no.
[Sniffles]
Seems like you got a lot left to live for, Mr. Delaney.
[Sighs]
Why would I disrupt trauma-one by taking away one of its best doctors while simultaneously pissing off the director of the O.R.?
Because it's the best of both worlds.
May I?
How so?
The position is for a surgical attending who covers the emergency department.
That's what Cole Guthrie did.
Who better to cover trauma-one than someone who's spent his whole career working there?
Katie Miller says she still doesn't feel good.
I don't have any reason to hold her, but I don't feel right sending her home.
I mean, all alone with a new baby...
Thank you for talking to me about work and not asking me how I'm doing.
Be patient.
Trust me, you'll be surprised at how much you can endure, and how strong you actually are.
I'm sure you're right.
Wait a second.
Katie's heart rate was normal, right?
90.
A little high, but in the margin.
No, no, no, no, no.
Not if she's a marathon runner.
Normal is probably in the 40s for her.
P.E.?
Oh, god.
I got vitals.
I'll wire her up.
What's going on?
We just have to check something.
Have a seat.
Sats have dropped.
I'm getting worse?
[Breathlessly] I thought you said I was gonna be okay.
That's what we thought, but your oxygen levels are low.
We're gonna put you on something called an NRB mask.
It delivers high-concentration oxygen to your lungs.
Your symptoms could suggest a pulmonary embolism...
A clot in your lungs.
That would explain the elevated heart rate.
But I'm gonna be all right?
We need to get a CT scan right away to confirm whether it is a clot.
Ready?

What are you doing, Dr. Hudson?
Dr. Harbert approved my transfer to the surgical department.
He told me.
Congratulations.
However, the question remains.
What are you doing?
I'm... scheduling my patient's surgery.
This is still my department.
That means I assign your resident, your surgical nurses, your anesthesiologist, and your O.R.
Welcome to my team, Dr. Hudson.
Hand me my phone, please.
I want to check the scores.
Mom always said you were more stubborn than a constipated mule.
Yeah, well, Mom isn't around anymore, is she?
[Commotion in distance]
Ohh, you didn't.
Man:
Odell Beckham!
Woman:
That's Odell.

Hey, Mia.
Long time no see.
Odell!
How you doing, Coach?
Odell, please talk some sense into him.
You always were a smartass kid, you know that?
Where'd you get that jacket, man?
Michael Jackson's closet.
[Chuckles] Yeah, yeah!
Grace:
So, he still won't let you operate?
Neal:
I'm sorry, Grace.
No, I'm sorry you made a major life decision for this only to have...
That's not why I made it.
It's just what precipitated it.
Excuse me, Dr. Adams, is the girl in the family room with you?
- Yes, why?
- You better come quick.
Christa:
I went to bring her a book, and I found her seizing on the floor.
Neal:
Let's get her on oxygen, please.
Okay, open your mouth.
Let's move her.
Let's move her.
Neal:
Grace, what's her baseline blood pressure?
- She runs low. 90s over 70s.
- That's the tumor keeping it low.
- B.P. now 170 over 80.
- That's better, right?
- No, it's worse.
- No, it's worse.
Leanne:
She's in autonomic dysreflexia.
Her pressure can swing wildly from high to low as a result of the tumor.
And relative to her baseline, it's way too high.
Let's sit her up and get her legs underneath her, try and get her pressure down.
If we don't lower it, she could stroke out.
Christa, nicardipine.
Five milligrams an hour.
Got it.
I'll get the piggyback pump.
Oh!
Okay.
Ohh, oh, oh, oh.
We can't wait for the nicardipine drip.
10 of labetalol, please.
Push, not drip!
- Roseline...
- Pushing 10 of labetalol now.
[Speaks French]
[Sighs] Vitals stable.
Thank god.
Neal, it's time.
You ready for this?
Campbell isn't gonna budge, Leanne.
Whether it's tumor or edema, she's getting worse.
It's emergent now.
She could die.
Protocol is on our side now.
Let's get her upstairs.
Hey, hey.
Hey, Doc.
You know who this guy is?
Who doesn't?
Mr. Beckham, it's a real pleasure.
Thank you for helping me win my fantasy league two years in a row.
Where's my check?
You should've seen this guy when he first walked on the field.
He was catching balls with one hand the first day of practice.
I told anybody that'd listen that he was one of the greats.
Let's me and you talk, Coach.
Thank you for doing this.
I'm glad I can.
Grace...
Why Roseline?
What do you mean?
There must have been hundreds of girls in that camp.
Why this one?
A long time ago, there was another little girl.
She was smart.
In fact, they put her in classes with kids a lot older than her.
The kids laughed at her because she came to school with her own stepladder.
A stepladder?
She was too little for the blackboard.
She wanted to make sure that if she was called upon, she could reach it.
That was you.
It's also her.
I wanted to learn.
Nothing was gonna stop me.
I'm not gonna let anything stop her, either.
Lizzie?
Lizzie!
What happened?
She lost pulses while on BiPAP.
Lizzie, honey, it's okay.
I'm...
I'm right here.
It's been four minutes.
Okay, let's do a pulse check.

Come back to me, Lizzie.
Please, just fight.
Call it.

Oh.
Oh.
They're with me.
♪
I believe, Lizzie.
I believe, okay?
I love you.
And I'm gonna see you again, because I believe.
Pulmonary embolism.
Good catch.
What do you want to do?
You could give her alteplase, bust up the clot.
But that risks a hemorrhage of the c-section.
Dr. Rorish, you have a sec?
38-year-old female, pulmonary embolism in the right lung.
Vitals stable.
Elevated resting heart rate, and she's a new mom by a c-section.
You debating alteplase?
- How many days post-op?
- Four.
She could bleed out.
But if you wait, the saddle embolism could kill her.
So, what should we do?
I'd take the risk and do the alteplase now.
But talk to the patient.
Let her make an informed decision.
Malaya:
That's our recommendation, but the decision has to be yours.

When I was... going through IVF, my mother asked me what would happen to him if something ever happened to me.
I thought she was just being unsupportive.
She thought what I was doing was selfish.
And maybe it was.
But I wanted a second chapter.
We're all entitled to that.
And then this little guy came along.
Turns out the chapter was being written by him, not me.
I want to live.
I still tell people about that Eastern game.
Last quarter, down five, clock running out.
He hasn't changed my mind.
Not what I was hoping to hear.
We need to get you to surgery now.
They had you, uh, double-covered with the safety over the top.
Somehow, you... you outran the coverage...
Odell:
Coach and took it to the house.
Coach!
I'd never seen anybody get so much air.
[Chuckles] Coach.
- And they held you...
- Coach.
What?
!
You're just gonna keep talking, huh?
The more I talk, the less I have to listen to you trying to convince me to go under the knife.
- You need the surgery.
- Why?
Because if you don't, you'll die.
- Maybe I'm okay with that.
- That's selfish.
You never taught me about giving up,
- and now you're giving up on us?
- Beth left me.
Mrs. Coach.
Remember?
I mean, can you believe that after all these years?
She just decided she had enough of me.
We were supposed to spend our last, best years together, now I got nothing.
You have Mia.
[Scoffs] I don't want to be a burden on her.
[Sighs]
Coach, you taught me never take your losses into the next game.
Ever.
Good advice.
And what if it doesn't work?
What... what if I put her through all this and I'm still dead?
Then I'll give a beautiful speech at the funeral.
I'll let them all know that I would never be here without you.
You teached me how to have courage, play with grit, stay persistent.
We need to get this done.
[Helicopter blades whirring]
I mean, literally, I have this...
This weird sensation where I look at my hands, but...
They're not my hands.

You know what I mean?
One thing's for certain.
It is definitely going to get better.
You sure about that?
Absolutely.
[Pager beeps, vibrates]
Well, that didn't take long.
Welcome back.
Malaya.
It's good to see you back again.
You're worried about her.
In my experience, we heal better from the things that are done to us than the things that we do to others.
What does that mean?
My mother used to call it "getting right with God."
Now, you don't have to tell me anything that you don't want to, but that doesn't mean that I can't make a suggestion.
That man, the one who hurt our people, is still here.
His body is in the morgue, unclaimed.
Every other Saturday, the hospital buries all the unclaimed bodies in white oak cemetery.

It's not a summer job.
I started in the fall and I've been promoted twice.
Oh, so you... so you're not in school?
I took a gap year.
That is so zeitgeist.
Well, thank you for the stuff, Jenna.
I'll see you around.
Lightning bolt of inspiration.
What do you think about an exposé on renegades and a nonconformist who decided that college was a waste of time and money?
Jake?
Hello, Bill Gates.
Uh, Steve Jobs.
Dropouts.
Yeah, you never know.
I would love to watch you in your environment.
Maybe ask some questions.
- Get some pictures.
- Why don't you come by the club and I'll show you how the magic happens?
I am looking forward to it.
Ugh, Matty, finally.
You're so late.
I don't know if I'm really up to the whole conversation stuff today.
Matty, I know it's summer and it's time to raise the roof or whatever, but if you want to succeed, you have to put in the work, like Jenna.
Did she tell you she's getting an e-book?
I'm so proud of her.
Have you read any of her stuff?
Yeah, I have.
You proud now?
What's more celebratory, red or white?
For someone who was just awarded for excellence in written communication,
I was hopelessly grappling for the right words to say to Matty.
_
_
Or we could just sit here and text Matty.
Sorry, I just...
I promised him I would get this article taken down but I haven't yet.
And you're not going to.
And for what it's worth, your slightly harsh assessments were pretty valid.
Hey, I was just as harsh on myself.
Yeah, I guess.
Well, what about the paragraph
I wrote on my flaws and my insensitivities?
College giving me a false sense of maturity?
Me projecting my insecurities?
Wait, where... where is it?
Where the [bleep] is it?
Oh, my God, did it get cut?
How did I miss this?
No wonder Matty's so pissed.
I'm pissed too.
Cutting out that section changes the entire article into one long, negative rant about Matty.
Is this how Idea Bin gets its hits?
Real classy.
Wow, Jenna, way to be grateful for getting your piece on the front page.
Do you know how hard that is to do?
God forbid Matty should ever have his feelings hurt.
Luke.
If I wasn't careful, this article was gonna ruin more than one relationship.
I had to confront Ethan.
What was posted was not what I intended and technically not what I wrote.
Jenna, OMG!
This is a tumblr-nado.
A quote from your Matty article has over 50,000 notes.
It's also not what I wrote.
Ethan took out the entire heart of my article.
I'm gonna go give him a piece of my mind and get it taken down.
Oh, no, that is not a good Idea Bin idea.
- Why not?
- Because of all the buzz the piece is getting and then it just disappears?
People will wonder why.
They'll think there's some nasty backstory.
It'll end up getting more attention.
What do I do?
Luke put himself out on the line for me with Lizzy, and Matty thinks I wrote a smear piece.
How do I tell him I was edited into a corner?
I don't know.
I guess you could tell him.
They still make film for those?
I buy old stock on eBay.
That one expired in '97.
Don't shake it too hard or else the chems will leach out and melt your skin.
So, want to see what I actually do for my job?
You don't bartend?
Basically, I'm in charge of everything.
I know this sounds like anti-femme, but I must admit I love when a guy can take charge.
Hey, dude, some kid took a dump in the pool again or it may just be a mochaccino.
Either way, you might want to check it out.
Well, Sully,
I'll have to ask you to deal with that.
It's a lifeguard's duty.
Doodie duty.
Uh, we catching you in the middle of something here?
Ophelia here is interviewing me for an article.
You look familiar.
Do I know you from somewhere?
Nope, I don't think so.
You're Mark.
From Jenna's article.
Someone posted a picture of you in the comment section.
I am such a fan.
Oh, great, I have fans.
Dude, I finally took a peek.
I didn't even know you were having a hard time up at Berkeley.
College.
Not such an easy time.
This is amazing.
The contrast between two friends on two different roads.
Maybe we should check out the cabanas.
- Oh.
- Hmm?
Girls in whore shorts have to wait at the back of the line.
Sorry.
I'm so sorry about that.
What the hell, Sadita?
You can't just assault my customers like that.
Well, maybe if you acted like a better boyfriend and responded to my texts in a more timely fashion,
I wouldn't have to resort to emergency protocols.
Since when am I your boyfriend?
Since you reintroduced your P to my V. Duh.
You told me before you left for school you didn't want to be tied down while you were away.
Well, now I'm back.
So you can tie me down all you want.
Come by my place when you're done feeding all these sluts.
I...
One second.
What do you want?
Matty, hey, there's something about the article I want you to know.
The article you said you were gonna take down, that's still up?
Well, yes, part of it is still up.
What are you talking about?
The whole thing is still up.
That's just it.
The whole thing was never up.
They butchered it without asking me.
- Yeah, sure, Jenna.
- Matty, please believe me.
- I didn't know.
- Whatever, maybe don't put your name on something if you don't know what's in it.
Matty, if you just read the whole article
I'm sure you'd under...
Why didn't you tell me you were only publishing half my article?
Huh?
Oh, wait, the boring half?
Hon, I did you a favor.
Without my intervention, your article was just another middle of the road, "It's both our faults"
slide of bland-ana cream pie.
Our readers crave a point of view.
Okay, I don't want to come off as a brat, and I'm happy to have had something go viral, but I want my piece reposted in its entirety.
Jenna, let me just save you from yourself here, okay?
Every good writer draws on personal experience and sometimes we struggle with offending some people from point to point, but if viral views are what you're going for, brutal honesty is the best policy.
Honesty would be representing both sides of the breakup.
Oh, grow up.
The audience for your little apologist paragraph is exactly one... your ex.
Not exactly the demo we're courting, hon.
Oh, and, hon, I wouldn't go to Lizzy with this.
She has no patience for this sort of thing.
Trust me, if you walk through that door, it is not gonna end well.
There has never been a summer where a fellow didn't disappear.
Do you want to be the one, hon?
Read the article about Matty.
A little cruel, don't you think?
I was just trying to write something honest which is what good writers do.
So good writers sell out their friends to get e-books?
I wasn't trying to sell anyone out.
I was just trying to write the truth.
It's not my fault that they left...
Reminds me of a certain letter
I once wrote to you.
- That was actually cruel.
- It was.
I called you a pussy.
"He didn't have the guts to do it himself, so I had to do it for him."
It kind of sounds like you're calling him a pussy.
I called myself a pussy too, okay?
But they won't publish that part.
That's the real problem here.
As awful as that letter was
I wrote to you, it was private.
You told Matty's truth to the whole world and that, Jenna, that's the real problem.
I convinced myself that I was just being a good writer but in the cold, harsh light of my mom's words,
I saw what I really was.
A [bleep] friend.
It was time to make this right no matter what.
Whoa, whoa.
Slow down, Sadita.
What's the problem?
I...
I need more.
Oh, I will give you more.
No, you know what I mean.
We keep doing the same thing.
I'm not doing butt, Sergio.
I'm serious.
You know what, I want more than sex.
You know, I want closeness, you know?
Like emotional intimacy.
Emotional intimacy?
You make chalupas.
Good one, Sadita.
Deflect an honest attempt to have a conversation with an insult to my heritage and my line of work.
You're so predictable.
That was unpredictable.
It was amazing.
I don't need an Uber, Jake.
No, no, just calling for food.
Oh.
Sorry.
Other guys just usually want me to leave.
Yeah?
Well, I'm, uh... not like other guys.
You're not like other guys.
I mean, guys our age, they don't know what they want but you already have what you want.
You're satisfied with working here.
You don't need anything better.
You don't care about big money or higher education, and you're completely content to live in your hometown your whole life.
You're like the ultimate townie.
So I guess since both my mom and dad basically abandoned me that's why I never get close to anyone.
Wow, what a breakthrough.
You don't think I already know all that?
It's why you're so rude.
I'm sorry, but I don't know what you want from me.
I want you to let me in.
I let you in every time I see you.
Any time something real comes up, you want to solve it with sex.
- You're like a guy.
- And you want emotional intimacy.
You're like a...
Don't say it.
Look.
It's my summer vacation and I want to have fun and...
Go back to school and come back here on another break and pick up where you left off.
Is that so bad?
Yeah, it is.
It doesn't work for me anymore.
Why?
Because I love you.
I...
I appreciate that and I love your hair and your lips...
- And?
- And...
Forget it.
You don't have to say it because I know you do.
I want my article taken down.
The article that earned you the e-book?
I really appreciate you pushing me to explore the more personal things to me, but this article was too personal and not just to me.
I hurt someone I care about when I wrote it, and it got butchered in the edit.
Bite that hand, hon.
I want it taken down.
Anything else you want, Jenna?
I guess I should pack up my things.
You probably should.
But don't.
You're a pain in the ass, Jenna, but you know, there isn't a writer out there who isn't a giant, colossal pain in the ass.
I wanted to kill Ophelia at least two separate times last week and now I'm going to give her the e-book instead of you and I'm gonna take the article down.
Hits on it have slowed anyway and maybe a little ghost post will drum up some interest.
I've had a whiny ex or three of my own who didn't like my articles, but if you ever ask me to take something down again,
I'm going to make you clean out the office microwave with your tongue.
Got it.
Yeah.
Now sit down.
You're late for this meeting.
I got it taken down.
It's erased forever.
Not for me, it isn't.
Look, what you and I went through, a lot of people go through and I was just trying to use us as an example of universal experience.
And I'm sure that the people who read that article will understand.
Well, I don't care what all those other people think of me, Jenna.
I care what you think of me.
And now that I've read your article, I know.
You think I'm a loser and you didn't even have the guts to say it to my face.
Would you please just read the whole thing?
I'm done reading.
I'm done talking about this and I'm done with you.
He's never gonna forgive me.
Then he's an idiot.
Can we go now?
Maybe I'm the idiot.
Luke, I'm sorry.
It's just... it's something I have to do.
If you don't want to wait...
I don't.
Matty, hello?
Hey, look, if you're not gonna answer the door, then I'm just gonna say it.
I'm sorry.
I don't even know if you can hear me right now but...
"I was drowning in my own self-importance.
"Being on my own at college
"had given me a false sense of maturity,
"but the reality was that I was no more independent
"or adult than he was.
"In fact, Mark had always been
"more grown-up than me when it counted.
"After I had so rudely rejected him,
"I began to wonder if I would ever encounter
"another human being that would have
"such a profound influence on my life.
"He would always be my first true love... and that's something you never forget."
You came back.
Got three blocks away and realized what a jerk I'd been.
You?
- I'm the jerk.
- No, you're really not.
You care about how your actions affect others.
I was just reacting to the fact that the other in this situation was Matty.
And I so get that, but I promise you have nothing to worry about with Matty.
He'll probably never speak to me again, anyway.
Thank you... for coming back.
I'm sorry this has been so much drama.
I will stick my neck out for you any day.
Drama or no drama.
And I'm sorry if I added to it.
The apologies were flying fast and loose.
I was glad to have heard Luke's.
I only wished Matty had heard mine.
Previously on "Awkward"...
- My piece is on the front page.
- Babe, that's amazing.
But what if Matty sees it?
Hey, Jenna, did you write a super-detailed post about our relationship on Idea Bin?
You had no right to do this.
I'm sorry I thought we could be friends because the reality is you haven't changed at all.
I'm sorry!
[rock music playing]
My article had gone viral but the one person it really infected was Matty.
I had worked really hard to write something
- that was fair - _
- and I hadn't been shy about - _
- pointing out my own faults - _ and bad behavior, but he was pissed and I was realizing
- that I had to do the right thing.
- _ [phone dings] [all cheering]
Hon, grab the biggest hose you can find because your post is on fire!
Congrats, Jenna.
Jenna, have you seen the comments?
Tears plus 50 crying emojis.
So presh.
Oh, "Mark sounds like such a giant loser."
Don't bother the boss when she's working.
This better be important.
Uh, Lizzy, can I have a word with you?
How about 75,000 words?
Uh...
Jenna, you did it.
You took my profoundly inspiring words to heart and your article got 300,000 hits.
Right, about the art... 300,000 thousand?
You wrote from the heart and do you know what that accomplished?
Well, I know one thing it accomplished, which is why I was really hoping...
Follow me, young protégé.
Let's give it up for Jenna, everybody.
She has done the impossible in the shortest amount of time in Idea Bin history.
She has connected with people on a deep and intimate level.
I am blown the [bleep] away.
So blown away that I have decided you are the fellow
I'm awarding the Idea Bin e-book.
[applause]
Uh, wait.
I'm the one getting the Idea Bin e-book?
You have proven that people are interested in what you have to say.
So think about what you want to say next, because 300,000 people might want to know.
I, uh...
What I should've said next was, "Take the article down"
but I...
I...
This is amazing.
Thank you.
Oh, um.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, slow down.
Jenna, this is the first time she's given an e-book to a summer fellow, and it's you.
Yeah, well, that's not without its own problems.
I'm thinking of asking Lizzy to take the article down.
What?
Why?
Matty's pissed.
Wow, so this is about Matty.
Matty is selfish if he wants you to take it down.
You're a writer, Jenna.
You wrote about something deeply personal and true.
That's what good writers do.
Seriously, this is a huge opportunity.
I'm not letting you blow it.
I swore to Lizzy you'd ace this.
I'm so glad you could join me for my 10:30 cup of cappu.
I can't get foam like this from the machine at work and I am desperate to download you on all the Patrick stats stat.
Yeah, totally.
Go.
- Patrick is such a Princeton Charming.
- _
He's gonna take me on a sunset sailboat ride when he gets back and... hello?
Hi.
What?
You're on Planet Smartphone instead of being present for "T" time.
I totally am.
Princeton, sunset, sailboat.
[phone ringing]
OMG, he just sent me a skinny-dip selfie.
What the hell, Tamara?
There's like 50 messages here in the last hour.
Duh.
That's what you do when you're dating someone.
I'm sure you and Sergio have nonstop spicy sex.
Not every 30 seconds like you crazy emoji junkies.
We're adults.
Not insecure, horny little tween-bots.
_
- Dead-dead?
- Over.
Finished.
Sayonara, Lissa and Jake.
- Sorry.
- Thanks for bringing my stuff.
Lissa doesn't want me to come by the house and confuse baby Morgan, which I get.
She gurgled something that sounded an awful lot like "Dada" at me the other day.
Morgan, not Lissa.
Hey.
Can I ask you a question?
- No and yeah.
- Huh?
No, I haven't read your article yet.
Yeah, Matty's still pissed.
All I know is he said that you were taking it down.
Ooh, Jenna, boyfriend?
Stepbrother?
Both?
Uh, neither.
[gasps] "Zen Gardening for the Spirit."
Did you finish the Chicken Soup series?
I annually reread "For the Horse Lover's Spirit"
It makes me feel equine and free.
How about you?
Hi?
Jake, this is Ophelia.
She's an amazing writer.
I love your ironic polo.
Palos Hills Country Club?
Where did you get that?
Uh, Palos Hills Country Club.
- This is Jake.
He works there.
- Manages.
You got a summer job in management?
It's not a summer job.
I started in the fall and I've been promoted twice.
Oh, so you... so you're not in school?
I took a gap year.
That is so zeitgeist.

Ugh, Matty, finally.
You're so late.

I hurt someone I care about when I wrote it, and it got butchered in the edit.
Bite that hand, hon.
I want it taken down.
Anything else you want, Jenna?
I guess I should pack up my things.
You probably should.
♪ Going under ♪
But don't.
You're a pain in the ass, Jenna, but you know, there isn't a writer out there who isn't a giant, colossal pain in the ass.
I wanted to kill Ophelia at least two separate times last week and now I'm going to give her the e-book instead of you and I'm gonna take the article down.
Hits on it have slowed anyway and maybe a little ghost post will drum up some interest.
I've had a whiny ex or three of my own who didn't like my articles, but if you ever ask me to take something down again,
I'm going to make you clean out the office microwave with your tongue.
Got it.
Yeah.
Now sit down.
You're late for this meeting.
[knocking on door]
I got it taken down.
It's erased forever.
Not for me, it isn't.
Look, what you and I went through, a lot of people go through and I was just trying to use us as an example of universal experience.
And I'm sure that the people who read that article will understand.
Well, I don't care what all those other people think of me, Jenna.
I care what you think of me.
And now that I've read your article, I know.
You think I'm a loser and you didn't even have the guts to say it to my face.
Would you please just read the whole thing?
I'm done reading.
I'm done talking about this and I'm done with you.
He's never gonna forgive me.
Then he's an idiot.
Can we go now?
Maybe I'm the idiot.
Luke, I'm sorry.

Hey, look, if you're not gonna answer the door, then I'm just gonna say it.
I'm sorry.
I don't even know if you can hear me right now but...
"I was drowning in my own self-importance.
"Being on my own at college

Got three blocks away and realized what a jerk I'd been.
You?

- No, you're really not.
You care about how your actions affect others.
I was just reacting to the fact that the other in this situation was Matty.
And I so get that, but I promise you have nothing to worry about with Matty.
He'll probably never speak to me again, anyway.
Thank you... for coming back.
I'm sorry this has been so much drama.
I will stick my neck out for you any day.

And I'm sorry if I added to it.

What the fuck, Tom?
I have this room at 4:00!
I know you don't get a lot of news downstairs, Zamparo, but we just broke up a massive terrorist plot, all right?
Try and keep up.
[sobbing]
Um...
What?
What is it?
Sir, when I flagged up this guy's email,
I thought the investigation was only gonna proceed if there was substantive criminal evidence to back it up.
We've got hours of him talking about waging jihad and killing children.
Right, but talking, though, sir, not... he's not doing anything.
Isn't that the point?
[chuckles]
Hey, Tim.
How's it going?
You celebrating something, Nate?
You seeing someone special, huh?
[soft chuckle]
Uh, yeah, actually.
How'd you guess?
[orchestral music plays]
[music stops]
Genius, emergency meeting in the conference room!
[laughing]
The crash was off 301 around 2:00 last night.
Local police controlled the scene, so, thankfully, the press knows nothing.
These containers carried cesium-137.
It's used for radiotherapy applications in hospitals, but it's highly regulated and had no business being on that truck.
When we tracked the shipment back to Baltimore, the customs record showed eight containers, not two.
So there's six more of them out there, all of them in the country illegally.
If that quantity made it's way into a radiological device, we could be looking at thousands of casualties, mass evacuations and radioactive contamination throughout the D.C. area.
- Tom?
- Yeah.
Uh, lab analysis puts the cesium coming from North Africa.
So the guys on four, they put together this map.
It's an analysis of Muslim communities in DC, Maryland and Virginia, along with their countries of origin.
We'd like each-- yes?
What about leads on the DT front?
Well, given the cesium came from North Africa, we don't think domestic is really in the picture.
The last time anyone tried to build a dirty bomb on US soil was James Cummings.
He was a white supremacist living in Maine, he was going to set it off at Obama's inauguration.
He had uranium, thorium, and he was trying to acquire cesium.
I'm sure you're familiar with the case.
It goes without saying, anyone here is welcome to pursue any leads they think are fruitful.
[orchestral music plays]
Okay, would you fucking stop--
- Oh, I'm so sorry.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- I'm Angela Zamparo.
- Nate Foster.
- I know.
You got a couple minutes?
DT's downstairs.
There's only one perk to being down in this shithole.
Nicorette just isn't the same.
So, Nate...
you seem like you've got a bit more going on than most around here.
You remember Oklahoma City?
Well, yeah, I guess I was five, but sure.
What do you know about Timothy McVeigh?
Ah... he was some kind of lone extremist in a militia?
Don't be an asshole who bullshits questions you don't know the answer to.
Here.
Timothy McVeigh was a decorated Gulf War veteran.
He was not insane;
he was not a lunatic;
and he was not stupid.
He was a white supremacist, following a plan.
- What plan?
- A plan from a book called The Turner Diaries.
It's about a "race war" to exterminate blacks, Jews, and "mud people."
You know how the war gets started?
The hero drives a truck bomb into a federal building.
Timothy McVeigh was reenacting that scene from The Turner Diaries.
He was carrying the book with him when he was arrested.
What he was trying to do was start the race war.
You're focused on the Islamic guys.
I get it.
We all create a narrative based on what we think is important.
We see what we want to see.
But just because you're not looking at something doesn't mean it's not there.
So, why are you telling me this?
[man] I'm talking about a blood andguts,in thestreet, killorbe killedracewar.
Ihaveinformation abouta truckaccident outsideDClastnight, involvingclassified radioactivematerial.
ButnowtheFBI istrying tocoverit allup.
Why ?
Becausesomething bigishappening, andit'sbiggerthan9/11 , andit'sbiggerthan OklahomaCity.
Sobewarned, bearmed,andbeready.
His name is Dallas Wolf.
He gets 20,000 listeners a night.
We believe he's based just outside of DC, but almost nobody knows him personally.
But I have an informant, a skinhead in a gang.
And the leader of that gang is friends with Wolf.
So I need someone to get in there, and get close to him.
Right and I'm trying to tell you that this is not my thing!
I barely passed the PFT!
What do you think undercover work is?
Beating guys up and shooting at them?
No, it's people skills.
It's controlling situations.
- It's this.
- Seriously?
This is the only undercover training you'll ever need.
I saw you with that Muslim kid.
You got most of this going on anyway.
Look, I read your file.
High IQ, great people skills, but not your typical FBI profile.
Introverted, an outsider, unhappy childhood.
Single mother, always moving around a lot, always the new kid, bullied at school, no close friends or--
Okay, okay, okay, fuck you!
That's... this is an invasion.
What gives you the right to look--
Because we don't have time to dick around here!
You don't smuggle a boatload of cesium into the country and then just let it fucking sit there!
Fine, but I'm trying to tell you,
I don't have the skills for this!
I can't even defend myself!
You do have the skills, and they mean you will never have to!
What did you say to that kid?
"You want to change things, so nobody has to suffer the way you did."

What the guys with the cesium... are gonna want?
Welcome to MedVale Medical Supply Company.

Most of our sales are online.
Our radiotherapy products are specifically designed for the handling and storing of radioactive material.
So we can acquire sensitive materials and hide them.

Hey, everybody.
14/88, brother.
Good to meet you.
All right, spread 'em.
Roy does our security.
Okay, fine.
Whoa, whoa, hey, what the fuck is that?
- What's what?
- That!
Under your fucking shirt there!
What is that?
Hey, are you a cop?
Hey, look me in my fucking eyes, boy!
Are you a fucking cop?
- No, I'm not.
- No?
Whoo!
[laughing]
He's fine.
Sorry about that, Nate.
But you know how it is.
- Yeah, absolutely.
- Whoa, whoa.
Have a seat.
You drink Bud?
Uh, yeah, absolutely.
Frank tells me you were in Iraq.
Uh, yeah, three years in the Corps.
- You kill anybody?
- Johnny!
He's Johnny.
He's a fresh cut.
We're trying to teach him the ropes.
I know the fuckin' ropes, man.
Yeah, then mind your fucking manners!
So, did you?
Kill anybody?
I don't talk about that.
[scoffs]
But what I did see was a lot of our guys go down.
Good guys... friends.
And for what?
I was on a WMD squad, the whole reason we were there, except we didn't find shit, did we?
Hmm.
So then I get home, I started listening to Dallas Wolf.
Oh, yeah?
Dallas and I go way back.
Oh, there's a guy I'd love to meet, you know.
He's somebody who's telling the truth.
He's out there, he's asking why were we there?
And the answer's always the same.
Iraq, 9/11, Osama bin Laden, what does it all come back to?
Look at every war we've ever been in.
How many white men slaughtered their brothers in World War II?
What, like a 100 million?
And for who?
Who's always pulling the strings?
It's all here in front of us.
But most people are blind.
Look at this bottle.
You see anything funny?
You're talking about the Jew tax?
What's the Jew tax?
Tell 'em, Nate.
Start looking at the food you buy, and you'll see this little "U."
The Union of Orthodox Rabbis gets paid to perform a "blessing" on everything in the grocery store.
For this "blessing," they rake in billions of dollars in taxes.
We can't control the ketchup, but we can control the streets.
That's how it went down in Germany.
And we think of ourselves as a Sturm Abteilung.
We are a thinking man's soldiers.
First here.
And then here.
And that is where the revolution starts.
We're not these tired old KKK guys, waiting for some catastrophe to start a race war.
- We're the catastrophe.
- That's fucking right.
And we need guys like you, with military backgrounds.
[scoffs]
We need best practices in our security.
Come on, man, I think our fucking security is pretty good.
Well, always room to improve, though, right?
Oh, yeah?
Like what?
Well, like, look at the position of this booth and then tell me, without looking, where the nearest exits are.
- What's your point?
- The point is, of all the large booths in this restaurant, you picked the one farthest from the exits.
If something goes down, we're fucked.
No, we're ready for whatever goes down.
Yeah, with only you and him, I don't know your name yet, I'm sorry, carrying?
Oh, and how the fuck you think you know that?
When you pat someone down so they're facing everybody's lap, it's pretty easy to tell.
You spend three years in Iraq, you learn how to scan a room.
And see threats.
Well, isn't that fucking impressive.
Now I only got one question for you.
What?
Why are you wearing Levis?
Levis?
Your fucking Jew jeans?
Yeah, no, sorry, I just couldn't help notice when I was patting' you down.
While you were doing your little detective work all up in everybody's lap.
So why are you wearing them?
Because when I got home from Iraq, my brother gave me these jeans... as a homecoming gift.
Now, does he understand the struggle we're in?
No.
But I'm sure as shit not gonna let a Zionist conglomerate keep me from wearing them.
You wanna boycott the Jews?
You ever look at the Fortune 500?
You'll be living in a fucking cave.
[chuckling]
He's right.
Shit, they probably own this place, too.
[rock music plays inside]
Frank tells me you run a medical supply company now?
Yeah.
Yeah, my military contacts helped me set up.
We're just starting out, but we got access to a lot of stuff.
That's great.
I'd love to talk to you about that sometime.
Yeah... anytime.
You know, when I was 13, I actually played soccer.
One day, I came into the locker room, right?
And there were these six niggers, and they had this friend of mine, this Irish kid, down in the stalls, right?
His head was up against the toilet, and his face was just covered,
I mean, covered in blood, like flaps of skin.
I'd never seen anyone get beaten like that.
And when I came in, they just stared at me.
They stared, and I...
I walked away...
and just left him.
I hated those motherfuckers.
Yeah, when I was your age, I got pushed around a lot.
- Yeah?
- It fucking sucks.
But you can use that.
Yeah, but with these guys, nobody can do shit to me.
I learned to be proud.
Strong!
- Yeah, but--
- To be an Aryan fucking warrior!
Isn't that right, Johnny?
[laughing]
All right, so what, are we gonna stand around all night
- or we gonna get fucking drunk!
- Let's go!
Come on, junior, let's get some fucking beer, motherfucker!
Come on, boy!
[laughing]
Get in there, boy!
Hey, Nate, you know what, man?
Everybody seems to really fucking like you.

I'm only so hard on you because I'm trying to protect you.
You have to remember your objective here.
This is about getting to Dallas Wolf.
So what do I do about that?
Try relating to these guys as human beings.
You know?
Open up to them, if you can.
You may have more in common with them than you think.
[Roy] Man, why the fuck does Vince make us come to this shit?
"Good networking, lots of movement guys." I mean, who gives a fuck?
[Nate] Well, is Dallas Wolf gonna be here?
[Roy] Who the fuck knows?
I don't listen to that talk radio bullshit.
Fuck!

Goddamn.
Hey, that looks good on you, man.
Yeah, thanks.
Um, just go in,

Hi, you must be Vince's friend Nate!
- I'm Becky, Gerry's wife.
- Oh, hi, nice to meet you.
- Such a pleasure to have you.
- Thank you for having me.
Yeah, of course.
Hey, Nate, I made some cupcakes.
The frosting is a little messed up, but they taste good.
[man] So,Dallas,we wanted...

Come check this out.

Fuck.
Yeah.
God, that's the first I'm hearing about this rally.
I mean, God knows you can't get any real news on the Yidivision, but still...
Are you planning on going, Nathan?
And this is Andrew Blackwell from the Aryan Alliance.
- Hail Victory, brother.
- Hail Victory.
The Aryan Alliance, huh?
I've read a lot about you guys.
Well, we're the premiere white nationalist group in the world, so that's not surprising.
[man] Earnest Walton, Grand Dragon, good to meet you.
Good to meet you.
Earnest is with the local Klan.
Yeah, you should stop by one of our meetings.
- We'd love to have you.
- [Nate] Oh, wow.
You should check out our website, too.
We're always looking for quality people.
Ah, I don't think Nate's into all that religious stuff.
Excuse me?
Religious stuff?
I just think Nate is a little more rational than that.
I'm not sure I know what you mean by that.
Come on, Nate.
Let's go back and get some food.
Stay away from those faggots.
They got this fucked up religion where they think the Bible was written for white men and Aryans are the lost tribes of Israel.
The Bible.
Jews invented Christianity.
Jews invented the printing press, and the Bible is the most published book in the world.
I mean, anything seem off to you?
How about the fact the Romans conquered every mud race on earth, and then Christianity finished them off in a hundred years?
You gotta know who to stick with in this movement.
You're with us.
Goddamn it, Vince, every time we come here, the whole fuckin' place is dry!
- What the fuck, man?
- It's two hours, be good.
Gerry, there's somebody I want you to meet.
This is Nate.
- Hey, Gerry Conway.
- Nate Thomas, nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.
Vince told me all about you.
Make yourself at home.
I am throwing on some veggie burgers.
Thanks for having us.
- Hi!
- Hey, hey, I'm Nate.
- Madeline.
Nice to meet you.
- Hey, Madeline.
- This is Timmy.
- Hey, Timmy.
You want to come see our tree house?
Uh, yeah, sure, where are we going?
Oh, right, yeah, there.
Oh, wow, that is great!
Did your Dad build this?
- I built it!
- You built this?
- But my Daddy helped.
- Okay.
Wow.
- It's to protect us.
- Yeah, from what?
If the mud people come.
Always be ready.
Always be watchful and stick together.
You guys kidnapping my guest?
- Huh?
Huh?
- [kids screaming]
This is amazing, man.
Well, I've always been good with my hands.
And it was just wonderful to have a project with the kids.
You know how you spell love, Nate?
T-I-M-E.
Ninety percent of the time you'll ever spend with your kids
- comes before the age of 12.
- Wow.
Yeah.
You been in the movement long, Nate?
Um, not long.
Just since I got back from Iraq.
Oh, yeah, right.
Yeah, Vince told me you served.
- Mm-hm.
- Mm-hm.
Hey, Nate, don't take this the wrong way but you kind of seem a little mature for a skinhead.
[chuckles] Really?
Yeah.
Yeah, maybe.
I don't know.
Um, what about you?
You seem to know a lot of people in this movement.
Ah, they probably come for the free food.
Ah, no.
You have these barbecues often?
Yeah, as much as I can, yes, you know,
I try to create a positive environment for everybody in the community, and a place for us to come together and be
- [Roy and Johnny arguing] - healthy in body and spirit.
"Fuck you, bitch!" And he turned around, and he's like--
Guys!
Guys!
Language, please.
Kids.
Jesus fucking Christ.
[scoffs]
It makes me so sad to see those two.
They gotta clean up their act.
Well, how do you mean?
Well, the cigarettes, and alcohol, the language.
This is what's happening to our young Aryan men.
Yeah.
To be honest, now that I met you,
I'm kind of surprised you invited those guys.
Well, you can't exclude them.
I mean, they're the next generation.
They need our help.
Need to understand their heritage, and be proud of it.
That's what it's all about, isn't it?
The children.
What kind of a world will they grow up in?
Goddamn, man, that was the worst fucking party on earth.
[groans] Jesus Christ, what kind of bullshit vodka is this, man?
Man, that's the last time I ever let you pick it out.
Man, look at that shit.
Look at that!
That is just fucking...
God, that is so fucking awful!
Man, look at that, look at that beautiful Aryan woman and that fucking...
Roy, come on, let's go the fuck home.
No, no, man, we're gonna teach these two a lesson.
- No!
- Get your fucking hands off of me!
Don't you ever fucking touch me again.
You hear me?
We're Aryan warriors, right?
That means we got a responsibility to do something about shit like this.
Hey, you two!
You need to get the fuck out of here!
Hold on, what did you say?
I said, get the fuck out of here or we're gonna kill you, you fucking spic!
What the fuck is your problem?
- What's our problem?
- [man] Yeah.
You come into our country, you fuck our women.
Yeah, you got some big fucking balls, huh?
- Put the fucking knife down and calm down, all right, man?
- Oh, my God!
They get the point.
You thought you were a big man, huh?
He gets it, Roy!
He's fucking shaking.
I thought you were a big man.
- Put the fucking knife down!
- Fuck you, motherfucker!
I'll fucking gut you, you piece of shit!
Now go, fucker!
- [screaming] - [alarm blaring]
- Come on, let's go!
- Shit!
Fuck, Nate.
Goddamn it!
You're fucking lucky!
What the fuck is your problem?
You fucked the whole thing up!
Yeah, I think they got the message, Roy!
Got the message?
Are you a fucking idiot?
Man, those two were mine!
And then your dumb fucking ass decides...
Hang on, wait a minute...
first you tried to stop me, then you try to scare them off, and then you set off that fucking alarm.
That wasn't an accident, was it?
Was it, Nate?
You wanted them to get away.
What the fuck, Nate?
Huh?
I said what the fuck?
Okay, you're goddamn right I wanted them to get away!
You want to be a soldier, Roy and not a fucking thug?
Then think!
You think about security cameras, Roy?
You think about the liquor store we were just in?
You think about the clerk or the license plates on my fucking truck?
You think about any of that shit?
Fucking Aryan warrior...
A hundred spics and niggers ain't worth the life of one white man, but go ahead, put us all in prison.
That's how you're gonna win your race war?
Huh?
Fuck!
All right, whatever, can we just get back on the road and get the fuck out of here?
Fuck!
[Angela] Iranthoselicenseplates.
Anaccountant,aschool teacher,a lawyer,fireman, he'sanengineer, not a criminal record in sight, butAndrewBlackwell, he'sa differentstory.
Whyishe here?
Uh, he said he was going to Wolf's rally.
He's the National Director of the Aryan Alliance.
They're based in Ohio, he wouldn't just come all this way to be in a rally.
Wait, if Wolf is involved in this, he can't be doing it alone, right?
I mean, he'd need help, and organization.
Exactly, so you need to figure out how Wolf and Blackwell are connected, and why he's really here.
[chatter]
Vince, good to see you.
Rich, can we get some literature, please?
- White power.
- White power.
Okay, we're gettin' ready to get started here.
Can everyone take a seat?

[applause]
If you take millions of white people, and flood every country in Africa with them, what do they call that?
Genocide.
But what's happening to every white country on earth?
You've got affirmative action...
- [men agreeing] - ...that kills white jobs.
Abortion, that kills white babies.
Gay rights, that kill white families.
Folks, let me explain something to you.
"Diversity" is a code word.
And what it means is white genocide!
[cheering]
So, we'll begin marching at the courthouse.
And after two blocks--
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
This is not the order that we agreed to.
Aryan Alliance is supposed to be heading this march.
[man] Now just a second, Andrew.
You know, we're at this rally every year, and we start with the Colonial Patriots.
[Andrew] Well, this isn't "every year," is it?
To be fair, Harris, maybe we should.
You're a local organization...
Vince, can you introduce me to Dallas?
"The Klan"?
You're not "the Klan."
Yeah, sure.
Come on, let's go.
You're the "Invisible White Knights" of the Ku Klux Klan!
Which is what, the third Klan group in the DC metro area?
!
Hey, Dallas!
Good to see you.
It's... it's Vince, Vince Sargent?
Right, Vince.
Good to see you.
Good to see you.
I want to introduce you to my good friend, this is Nate Thomas.
- I'm a huge fan of your show.
- Thank you, sir.
If you'll excuse me.
I have to get ready for the march.
[indistinct chatter]
- Uh, Mr. Wolf?
- Yes, what is it?
I didn't want to get into this in front of Vince, but I'd like to talk to you about an investment.
- An "investment"?
- Mm-hm.
I represent a few people who are big fans of yours, and they want to help.
- Is that so?
- Yes, sir.
They have a number of assets in the online media space, and they feel the potential for your show is being limited by your advertising budget.
They want to help you penetrate some new markets, and they see no reason why you can't go nationwide.
Well, that is great, son.
That is just great.
Here, call this number and we'll talk.
Okay, great.
That sounds great, Mr. Wolf.
- Call me, Dallas.
- Thank you.
[people chanting] Racist scum!
Racist scum!
We're here today because we're proud of our race!
We love our race!
And we're here to say that.
- White power!
- [all] White power!
The white race is under attack in this country.
- [Andrew] White rights!
- [all] White rights!
But nobody seems to give a damn!
- [Andrew] White freedom!
- [all] White freedom!
[patrons yelling indistinct]
- Where's Al Sharpton?
- [man] Fuckin' rednecks!
Where's Jesse Jackson to fight for white rights!
- White power!
- [all] White power!
White equality!
- [Andrew] White pride!
- [all] White pride!
If you're white, and you are standing over there...
- [Andrew] White freedom!

...you're on the wrong side of that barricade!
- [Andrew] White rights!
- [all] White rights!
Nate!
Wake up, white people!
Wake up!

It's morning in America and there's a new day coming.

[Dallas] Come join your race!
That's some fucker that works in my building.
[Dallas] Come join the white race!
[all] White race!

[crowd] Racist scum!
Racist scum!
Racist bum!
It's the fucking AFL.
Don't worry, they won't do shit.
Well, well, well, if it isn't the American fucking losers!
[all yelling]
Yeah, fuck you!
Why don't you come over the fucking barricade, motherfuckers!
Johnny!
Hey, man, just fucking stay back, okay?
- Don't fucking do it.
- I gotta help him.
Help him by not getting the fuck arrested, okay?
- Fucking pussies!
- [man] White Nazi scum!
Yeah, you know what?
I can do that shit, too.
I'm gonna fucking kill you, motherfucker!
- Do not engage.
Do not engage.
- [man] You think I'm playing around?
I'm gonna fucking kill you!
Get your hands off of me!
I'm gonna kill these motherfuckers!
Stay back!
- White power!
- [all] White pride!
- White power!
- [all] White pride!
[all yelling]
He hit me in the fucking eye!
It's fucking piss!
Johnny!
[yelling continues]
Andrew, can you walk?
[groaning]
[engine starts]
Get the fuck outta here.
You okay?
Everyone okay?
- [Andrew groans]
- Sorry.
Okay.
Stay with us.
I'm getting you out of here, man.
Go...
Go right, go right!
Oh, fuck!
- Fuck!
- Fucking... [honking horn]
Holy shit!
We gotta go!
We gotta fucking go!
[indistinct yelling]
I can't fucking go anywhere!
Stay down!
[tires screeching]
Fuck!
[panting]
No, don't get up.
You need to rest.
I brought you some chamomile tea.
It'll help you relax.
Thank you.
There's our wounded warrior.
How you feeling, buddy?
Yeah, much better.
Thank you, guys.
Ah, no problem.
I'm gonna put some music on.
I brought you Sammy to keep you company.
Thanks.
[orchestral music plays]
Oh, wow.
You like it?
I...
I love Brahms.
See, Becky, I knew he was quality.
I think the fourth is my favorite.
Yeah, mine, too.
Except maybe the--
The first?
[chuckles] Yeah.
Now listen, if you like Brahms,
I've got this Clarinet Quintet that will blow your mind.
They're dead, Gerry.
Dead.
I'm gonna find them, and we're gonna string them up--
Alright, I hear ya.
I hear ya.
That's why I avoid the political stuff.
Not my thing.
Besides, I've heard it can be dangerous.
[both chuckling]
That was fantastic.
Thank you...
I thought you guys were vegetarians.
Everybody's gotta have a few vices every now and then.
[phone buzzing]
What's "vices"?
Oh, boy, there we go!
I'm sorry about that, that's my ride.
Gerry, Becky, thanks for everything.
Nathan, I don't know what to say.
I owe you, big time.
Why don't you stop by the compound some time.
Oh, I'm not really in Ohio that much, but I'd love to if I ever am.
No, I meant the...
the new one.
- Oh.
- Here in Virginia.
Oh, right, yeah, please, I'd love to.
- Bye.
- Have a good night.
Bye, Andrew!
Well, listen, you're not going to believe it, but when it comes to Tchaikovsky...
gotta go with Bernstein.
- Leonard Bernstein?
- I know, I know.
Gerry, I hate to break it to you, man--
I know.
Listen, I can't help it, he's a great conductor.
Jews listen to Wagner, don't they?
So, Gerry, if you don't mind my asking, how did you end up in the movement?
Listen, for me, it was the books.
My parents were practically liberals.
Totally blinded by the ZOG.
You know, I always knew something was wrong;
and I had this anger,
I couldn't put my finger on it, until here.
It all started with this.
I was 13.
Read it in four days.
It explains race, culture, capitalism and how democracy destroyed Western civilization.
Democracy:
"Three people form a government.
Then two of them vote to steal the wealth of the third."
- David Lane, right?
- Mm-hm.
Now here's something more recent.
You'll love this.
This breaks down the entire worldwide Zionist conspiracy, step by step.
- You can bring it back.
- Oh, no, I couldn't.
Nate, Nate, please.
But that was it?
I mean, it was just books woke you up?
Well, you know, I had my theories.
And then a three-month engineering contract opened up in Kenya.
I was young, I wanted to see the world.
And, uh, Nate, listen,
I got no problem with them having their own country, everybody should.
But if you go there, and you see, they weren't even living like animals.
You know, animals don't live in their own feces, do they?
So, if you ever have any doubt white men created civilization, just go have a look.
[phone buzzing]
[Nate] Hey.
[Angela] So,howwasthe Brahms?
[Nate] How do you reason withsomeonelikethat?
Howcanyoueverhope tochangetheirmind?
[Angela]Listen,youneedto remember why you're doing this.
We'renotsocialworkers.
[Nate] You wanted me to relate to them as human beings, right?
"Openupto them?"you said.
[Gerry] ...they weren't even livinglikeanimals.
[Angela] Youwantto getadrink?
[Nate] Where are we gonna go andgetadrink?
[Nate and Angela laughing]
[Angela] This suspect, he was a fucking nightmare.
He was grabbing my ass, the whole thing.
And he kept insisting I go to this club with him, where I knew he was gonna make his big move, but if I didn't go, then, you know, I could blow my whole cover.
So what did you do?
So we're at a bar, and I tell him I want oysters.
So I get a dozen, I start plowing through them.
Then I start acting queasy.
I run to the bathroom, stick my finger down my throat.
- No way!
- Yeah!
So now there's puke all over my dress,
I tell him I got sick off the oysters and take a cab home.
Two days later, he was arrested.
- That is fucking awesome.
- Oh, it was fucked up.
But there was the thrill, you know?
That high.
God, there's nothing like it.
Yeah, so why'd you stop?
It was just it's no way to live, the paranoia, the tension.
And I wanted to spend more time with my kids.
You got kids?
You don't think I'm mommy material?
No, no...
No.
Yeah, I got two princesses.
Mommy and Daddy.
Perfect, little suburban life.
Anyway, I know how lonely this work can be.
But the case won't go forever.
You can't change the way people think, but you are making a difference.
Nathan, good to see you.
Can we get you anything, coffee?
Oh, no, I'm good, thanks.
This is a great set-up you got here.
Yeah, thanks.
All right, let's give you the tour.
This parcel is actually pretty small, but we're purchasing the one next to it.
Although, citizen's groups are trying to block us out.
Oh, yeah.
How are you handling that?
Well, we tell them we're here to stay.
Make no mistake about it.
We show up at their homes, their businesses, their churches.
They backed down pretty quick after that.
So you're moving the national headquarters?
No, we're keeping the compound in Ohio, it's just with everything going on right now, we needed a stronger presence here.
You know?
- Is that your firing range?
- Yeah, come on.
It's a little primitive, but we're working on it.
I'm no marksman, by any means, but I have some expertise in range design, just from training the Iraqi police.
What's your danger area template?
To contain your cone of fire.
I mean, how do you control your overshoot?
Uh...
We haven't gotten to that yet.
Okay, well, you might want to make sure it's the kikes and niggers getting hit and not your guys.
Absolutely.
Maybe if you have time,
- you could talk to the guys about it.
- Yeah, sure,
I need to see what kind of equipment you've got, but I'm happy to.
Okay.
Uh, come on up here.
Right now were just using this for storage.
- Are those cots?
- Yup.
We'll be able to sleep 200 in there.
And we're gonna need to.
I'm not gonna beat around the bush.
You see the type of organization we have here, but we could always use a man like you, Nathan.
Educated, war veteran, clean record.
I mean, hell, you don't even have any parking tickets.
Yeah, we have our contacts in law enforcement, local, state, federal, not to mention military hospitals, laboratories, you name it.
And so what's the overall objective here?
I mean, are you just trying to get the message out, or what?
Get the... get the message out?
To who?
We're not trying to recruit the public here.
What would we do with them?
They're at home sitting on their asses,
- watching sitcoms and surfing Facebook.
- [chuckles]
This is revolutionary activity we're talking about here.
Look, I'm flattered by the interest, but, you know,
I've been around the movement awhile now and a lot of these guys are all talk.
Now for me to really want to get involved,
I need to know there's bigger things going on here.
No offense.
Yeah... none taken.
All right...
Take a look at this.
This is the entire DC water system.
Plants, pipelines, the whole deal.
Now, Nathan, the guys you're hanging out with, they're all talk, because they're punks.
They're amateurs.
They sit around drinking beer all day, maybe they beat up a few niggers or each other.
We got no use for them.
We need men like you.
Can I help you?
I'm looking for Dallas Wolf, but I must have the wrong house.
Oh, no, he's here.
Come in.
Randy!
Someone's here!
Hey, Nate.
The studio's back here.
I'm moving studios right now, so this is all temporary.
Oh, no, this is a great setup.
Thanks for taking the time to see me, Dallas.
I just spent the afternoon with Andrew at the Aryan Alliance.
Oh, yeah?
Andrew's great.
They have an incredible organization.
Yeah, they seem really serious about the struggle.
About doing whatever it takes.
They're true patriots, those guys.
Well, let me give you a bit of background on me.
I was in Iraq for three years, on a WMD squad.
And then when I got back, my military contacts helped me set up a medical supply company.
V-A-L-E.
Wow, this is great.
Yeah, we do it all, from bandages and syringes to x-ray and radiotherapy equipment.
And with the highly regulated stuff, we can cut through a lot of the red tape and deal directly, and discreetly.
Fantastic, Nate.
Great to know.
So... you'd also mentioned an investment?
For the show?
Yes, I've got an investor lined up who's very excited about expanding your reach.
We're talking advertising, marketing, bigger servers...
That's exactly what I need.
So how do I meet him?
Well, a lot of my military contacts don't like to publicize their efforts.
But he'd love for you to put together a proposal about how you'd expand the show.
Funny you should mention that.
I've been trying to raise $7,500 to break into the Florida market.
They're ripe right now, with all the immigration stuff.
Yeah...
Yeah, this is great!
So, there's one more thing.
Go ahead, shoot.
The reason he's helping you is because he feels that you are a man of action, as he is.
As I am.
Right, sure.
So for him to move forward, he needs to know you're serious about this.
Nate, I've been ready to give my life for this cause for 20 years now.
What I need is the right people behind me.
So you tell your investor that if he wants action, he's got the right guy.
Um, sorry, Dallas, I've got kind of a long drive back, you mind if I hit the head?
[door shuts]
The whole case is about to blow wide open!
He's in with Wolf, he's in with the Aryan Alliance.
Yeah, and all we need to keep Wolf on the line is that $7,500!
Let me get this straight.
So after everything we spent on your cover, even after the medical supply business, you want me to ask for $7,500 asan"investment" inthisguy'sradioshow ?
You're the only one with a budget right now!
Oh, yeah, I'm just flush with cash!
I'm trying to run a 40-man investigation ontopof allthe shit I'vealreadygot!
Sir, the Alliance is building a compound outside DC.
Wolf's house is setting off a Geiger counter!
I spent six hours last night reading your transcripts,
Nate, you don't have shit!
Youdon'thaveshit!
Look at how much carbon is built up on this bolt.
- See?
See that?
Like--
- Yeah.
That's unacceptable.
When's the last time you cleaned this?
I've been meaning to get to most of them.
Okay, guys, seriously!
Okay, so we got an AR-15, serial number A00724, needs a new buffer spring.
Come on, guys, let's go!
We need to go through the whole inventory.
Andrew's waiting on this.
I'm gonna have to tell Andrew, the only way it's gonna change is with new policies.
[Andrew] And how do I know it's not me you're trying to fuck?
[Vince] Fuck you, you calling us liars?
[Roy] You get on the phone yourself!
Call them up and ask them...
Hey, guys...
Hey, Nate...
it's been a while.
Yeah, you kinda disappeared on us.
I'm sorry about that, Vince.
I've been kind of busy.
[Roy chuckles] Yeah, I bet you have.
Seems like you made a bunch of new friends around here, huh?
See, we were just wondering if maybe you could explain--
Roy!
Thanks for stopping by.
Be seeing you, Nate.
What was that all about?
Roy says the police have been following him.
He's paranoid about infiltrators.
Infiltrators, huh?
Yeah.
Mm.
That's why the police are on his ass?
Have you seen how that guy behaves?
It's a miracle he's not in jail already.
Right, uh, you want to help us with something?
Sure, what's up?
I'm throwing a youth event for Hitler's birthday.
There's a campground a couple miles from here.
- Help us scout it.
- Sounds good.
It's amazing how much land there is right outside DC.
[laughing]
Let me ask you something, Nathan.
What's your opinion on infiltration?
Well, how do you mean?
How do we prevent it?
Well, it's tough.
For one thing, you gotta keep guys with rap sheets out of important positions.
That's...
That's how they flip most people.
We have a polygraph back at the compound.
Maybe we should make everybody take it.
I mean, I think someone who's trained can beat a polygraph without blinking.
Yeah, maybe we should just do a background checks for everybody.
Get everyone's records and documents together?
Yeah, I mean, for informants, that might work.
But for law enforcement, they just forge whatever they need.
Yeah, but with a few phone calls, you know, a cover only runs so deep.
Do you suspect someone?
You know, it's like they say at these rallies.
You look to the left, look to the right, one of these people is a snitch.
It's the left.
Turn left right up here.
[no dialogue]
[Andrew] You okay there, Nate?
You look a little off?
No, I'm good.
Just, uh, tired...
been a long day.
Well, I think this is a great location.
What do you think?
Yeah, I like it.
Uh, well, what about the permits, though?
We tell them we're a Christian organization, holding a youth event.
I gotta ask you something.
Roy said he contacted the NPRC.
Said there's no record of you having served in the Marines.
You mean Roy went and filed a 180 with a government that he fucking hates, just to... okay.
I was on a WMD squad, so that's black ops.
And he knows that, the fucker.
Wait, hold on, are you guys taking this seriously?
Is that what that was all about in the truck?
Because, I understand you have to do your due diligence or whatever, but that's a fucking serious accusation!
I don't need to take that shit from anybody!
- Hey... hey, hey!
- Least of all from--
Okay.
Let's get out of here.
[Angela]Nate,listen.
Weneedto getthe serial numbersfirst,andthen--
No, look, I don't have time for that!
What if he wasn't convinced?
What if he calls Wolf?
The account name is Nate Foster, please.
You don't know if he was convinced!
You don't even know if they talk, okay?
You're being--
Yeah, I'd like $7,500 in cash.
You're a man of your word, which is a rare thing in this movement.
So, listen, Dallas, my investor is very excited, but he wants to know some more about what you're planning, some details.
Oh, okay, I think it was all in the presentation, but we start with online in Tampa, and then we move down the--
- No, no, I mean, beyond that.
- Beyond Florida?
Beyond the show, like what we talked about.
The actions we're gonna take.
I'm sorry, Nate.
I lost you.
What do you mean?
What I mean is, you have been talking a lot about a lot of big things that are coming.
Bigger than Oklahoma City, bigger than 9/11--
Oh, yeah, for sure.
Which is why expanding the show is so important.
Right, and I have been spending a lot of time with Andrew at the Aryan Alliance.
He told me you'd been working together.
Well, yeah, sure, I mean, he came to the rally.
No, no, what my investor needs to know is what are the concrete steps that you are taking to start the race war.
As I said to you before,
I have the expertise, the connections, the tools.
Maybe there's some kind of misunderstanding.
I thought we were talking about expanding the show.
Yeah, which my investor is happy to do, but if you're not willing to be honest about the other actions you're taking, then he's not gonna be able to support you.
Okay, Nate, fair enough.
Sorry it didn't work out.
I saw the plans, Dallas, for the water system.
Andrew showed them to me, okay?
So, I know all about it, and now I just need you to stop pretending and be honest with me.
This is private property.
You're no longer welcome here.
I'm asking you to leave.
Come on, Dallas.
I'm on your side.
Get the fuck out.
Now.
[phone buzzing]
Fuck.
[Angela] We'regoingto theoffice,
DallasWolfis there.
[Nate] You brought him in?
[Angela] No.
He came to us.
[door opens]
Sir.
I didn't know you'd be here.
Has anyone talked to him?
No, no, of course not.
No, it's your show.
So, Dallas.
Or should I call you Randy?
That is your real name.
You can call me whatever you like, Agent Zamparo.
Any reason you're using an assumed name?
I'm a public entertainer.
Ah...
Fine.
So, tell me why you're here today.
I'm here because of the guy I called about.
He shows up at my conference, talking about investing in my show.
Butthen,he 'stellingme howhecanget highlyregulateditems.

Hm.
Did he give you money?
- He tried to.
- How much?
- $7,500.
- Wow.
That's a lot.
- Why would he do that?
- Because he's a wacko!
Alotof these nutjobsapproachme.
Butthisguy isonanotherlevel.
[Angela] So you have no idea whyyou,of allpeople, wouldbeapproached bythisguy?
[Dallas] No,AgentZamparo,Idon't.
Right.
Let me play you something, okay, Randy.
[Dallas] I have information abouta truckaccident outsideDClastnight, involvingclassified radioactivematerial, butnowtheFBI istrying tocoverit allup.
Why ?
You've gotta be kidding me.
It's a radio show.
It's entertainment!
So you think it's entertaining to predict and incite terrorist attacks?
Whether I think it's entertaining is irrelevant.
Why don't you talk to somebody around here who knows something about the law, preferably a man!
Brandenburgvs.Ohio,1969, itisnotillegal toadvocateviolence.
[Angela] The First Amendment doesn't protect people who have knowledgeofan actualcrime!
What knowledge of a crime do I have?
Well, why don't you tell me, Randy?
What is this accident?
What is this FBI cover-up?
Why are you living at an unregistered address?
And why is that location lighting up a Geiger counter?
You've been following me?
You've been casing my house?
Why don't you answer my questions?
[Dallas] Letmeshowyou something.
Doyoumind?
Helpyourself.

You think you've got it all figured out, and you don't know shit.
I'm an entertainer.
I do this for money, and for fun.

Sofuckyou,AgentZamparo.
Canyouopenthe door,please?
[door opens]
- Now, Tom, look...
- Now, Tom, look, what?
Really, what could you possibly have to say?
Because this is a fucking disaster!
I warned you, I tried to tell you.
- We still might have a weapons case!
- We ran those serial numbers.
Every single one of those guns is legally registered.
Every one!
Okay, so you think there's nothing to any of this?
Right?
The prepaid cellphones?
The barracks for 200 guys?
- The water system plans?
- They're conspiracy theorists!
It's all talk!
He keeps those plans around to trot out when he wants to act like a big shot!
What are they gonna do, they're gonna put radioactive material in the water supply?
That doesn't make any fucking sense!
You two, you pull this from here and that from there, and you're making up this whole big fucking story in your head, and it's bullshit!
You know, we see what we want to see!
Well, now you've compromised him, and you've compromised the Bureau, and you've wasted all our fucking time!
This happens sometimes, you know?
- I mean, it sucks, but-- - "This happens"?
Is that all you're gonna fucking say after we find out all of this?
Everything you fucking put me through has been for nothing?
It's the nature of the work.
No!
This... this happened because of your pet theory!
And like an idiot, I went along with it!
"Oh, yeah, she's an expert," I thought.
"She knows what she's doing!"
I'm sorry, Nate.
Fucking why?
Why are you even sorry?
This has been great for you!
You got the thrill back!
You got the excitement you've been wanting, you got an escape from your little suburban life,
- by manipulating me!
- No, that is not fair!
I thought we had a case!
God, do you even know how many dead ends I've been down?
No, you fucking knew!
You knew I was so eager, so desperate to do something meaningful, to actually work on a real case in this place, that I would do anything you wanted, while you just sat back and enjoyed the ride!
Yeah.
Fuck!
[chuckles] Nate!
Hey, good to see you!
I've been calling you!
Yeah, I know, I'm sorry about that, I've been really busy.
I just wanted to return these.
I'm heading out of town for a couple of months, gonna work on setting up the business on the West Coast.
Oh, wow, wow, well, please come in.
Uh, that's nice of you, but I don't think I can.
Aw, come on, just for a cup of tea?
[orchestral music plays]
Is everything okay, Nate?
Yeah, yeah, why do you ask?
Well, you said you're headed out west.
Yeah, I'm gonna work on setting up the business on the West Coast.
Right.
God, it's hard to find what we're looking for in life.
But then, I listen to something like that.
One man made something...
that will make millions, maybe billions of people feel the way we just did.
We all have that power, Nate.
All of us.
Honestly...
I used to feel that way, Gerry.
I always felt like I could change the world.
You know, I could right wrongs, you know, fight injustice.
Nate, listen, it's guys like us that feel these things the most.
Idealists.
Yeah, I just keep thinking about that quote.
"For evil to triumph, it only takes good men to do nothing."
But how?
You know, fucking how?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Gerry, I shouldn't be...
- It's all right.
- I'm just really tired.
You know, Nate, maybe you're going about this the wrong way.
The rallies, the speeches, the politics...
That's not how the change is gonna come.
It's gonna come from the unknown soldiers, from the leaderless resistance.
How do you mean?
Let's go out back.
I made some improvements to the tree house.
Talking frankly is something we have to be very careful about.
- Something we always do outdoors.
- Right, of course.
You know, I've thinking about this for a long time, Nate, years really.
What's needed is an event.
What kind of event?
An event that wakes people up.
They're sleepwalkers out there.
They're blind.
Think about this regime.
Media brainwashing, secret courts, mass surveillance, Waco, Ruby Ridge.
Using Katrina and 9/11 to set up "refugee camps," or "detention camps", in other words, concentration camps, because who cares about the rights of a few Arabs, niggers and racists, if it makes us safer?
Right?
That's how it all starts.
All the lies that the Zionists tell about Nazi Germany, that's what's actually happening right now!
The irony of it!
Right?
That's why we gotta be smart.
That's why the event has to force the ZOG to show its hand.
It's gotta reveal the men behind the curtain.
Because it's not the event that wakes people up, it's the reaction to the event.
Yes!
Yes, you get it!
Yeah, Look at the Sons of Liberty.
Look at the IRA.
That is how you start a revolution.
Yeah, yeah, I always felt this kinship with you, Nate.
And...
I wanted to talk openly with you, but I just haven't known you that long, but I know in my heart, I can trust you.
You can.
You can, Gerry, I want to help.
I want to make a difference.
Okay.
I still got connections from my Africa days.
Okay, and we have the means to create that kind of event.
But, Nate, if you get involved we may not live to see the world we're building.
But I'll have helped to build it.
A man's body dies, but his deeds live forever.
[chuckles]
There's a way you can help us.
- Okay, yeah.
- Come here.
We need to talk to the S.A.C., now!
[man] Oh, my Lord, who the hell wrapped it?
You guys aren't trying to give it a bath!
Oh, hey, guys!
Sorry abut that, just having some technical difficulties over here.
- No problem!
- Be right over...
- Okay, one, two...
- Hey, Morgan, David...
I want you to meet somebody.
This is Nate.
Morgan, good to meet you.
- Greetings, sir.
I'm David.
- Hey, you guys.
So is the wedding out here?
Yeah, it's right over here.
It's beautiful, isn't it?
Wait till we see it all lit up.
[man] Pure of spirit and pure of race, these two souls commit themselves to the defense and prosperity of their sacred blood.
May their sons and daughters fill this land, forever honoring their duty to folk, kindred, soil, and honor.
[Gerry] I know you guys don'tknowNatethatwell .
But he's a good man and he's a good soldier.
If you trust me, you can trust him.
No luck yet.
No one wants to sell to an anonymous buyer.
If we give up that prepaid phone crap, I use my real name,
I got three guys I can get it from right now.
If we do it the morning of--
Yeah, I thought we were at least trying to do this without getting caught?
Guys, guys, shh.
Nate has a potential solution for us.
TATP.
It's much better than ammonium nitrate anyway.
A smaller quantity will give you a much bigger blast.
Yeah, well, sure, but where are we gonna get that?
I run a medical supply company.
And you're gonna get TATP?
I know it's not the easiest thing, but I've got some connections.
I can make a few calls and loop back with Gerry.
Assuming I can, what are we gonna do about the cesium powder itself?
Ready when we need it.
No, I mean, how are we going to handle it?
Well we've got heavy gloves, and we've got goggles.
No... radioactive particles will pass through those as easy as anything else, including your skin.
- Well, what do you suggest?
- I think we need suits.
They'll be pretty bulky, but we only need to wear them when the powder's out in the open.
When do we need them by?
[Gerry] Well, we've just been waiting for the explosive.
If you can get the TATP, Sunday is our day.
You guys remember Timothy McVeigh's last words?
Yeah, he read Invictus.
"It matters not how strait the gait, how charged with punishments the scroll,
I am the master of my fate:
I am the captain of my soul."
[country music plays]
[Nate] Are you sure this is gonna look right?
Wow.
It looks great.
The secret is the smell.
Where's the bleach powder?
Oh, it's right over here.
And you're sure they're not gonna try and test this somehow?
Yeah, that's why terrorists love TATP.
You can't identify it without a mass spectrometer.
- [phone buzzing]
- Okay, if you say so.
Yeah.
Uh-huh, yeah, I'm here now.
Sunday, so team's in place Friday night.
Look, can I just say
I'm sorry about what I said to you the other day.
I was exhausted.
Don't worry about it.
That's what this job does to you.
Keep at it another ten years and you'll turn into a real asshole...
like me.
[both chuckle]
It's totally secure.
We can keep everything in here, and then, on game day, we can use this space to put it all together.
Great, great.
This is great, Nate.
And here is the TATP.
- No problems, inquiries?
- Nope.
All good.
[Gerry] Morgan's a pharmacist.
All right.
Hm, these crystals seem a little small.
Smells about right.
Okay, let's test it.
Test it?
You got a mass spectrometer in your bag?
No, we'll just see if it burns.
What?
No, whoa, whoa!
Hold on, what do you mean?
Burn it?
What are you talking about?
Well, we use a sample, we set it a light.
It burns for a while before it explodes.
I saw it on YouTube.
Are you insane?
Do you know how dangerous this stuff is?
Hey, you are not the only one with experience!
This is a highly unstable substance, okay?
It's sensitive to heat, friction--
Which is why I'll do the test carefully!
Now you want to see the video?
Because I have it here on my phone!
I don't give a shit about what's on your phone!
We are not lighting this stuff on fire!
You know how many bomb techs I saw get their faces blown off trying to deal with this stuff in Iraq?
I've worked with this company for two years!
They are not gonna send me a container full of baking soda, okay?
Gerry, this doesn't work for me, okay, if he doesn't trust me, or my suppliers--
We need to test the fucking stuff!
You don't fucking trust me or my suppliers, that is your problem!
You want to use ammonium nitrate, fine with me!
- Okay.
- Fine with me.
Nate, Nate, Nate.
It's all right.
It's fine, it's fine.
Morgan, Morgan, he's right.
Come on.
He's right.
[David] So, can we see the suits?
And it's kind of hard with the gloves, but... and you zip that up and fasten along there.
You guys, what would be worse, radiation poisoning or wearing this thing around for a couple hours?
Yeah.
[Gerry] Soifyoueverhave anydoubt white men created civilization, justgohavealook .
[Nate] How do you reason withsomeonelikethat?
Howcanyoueverhope tochangetheirmind?
[phone buzzing]
[Nate] Hello?
Hey, hey, listen, something's wrong.
David drove to Frederick County earlythismorning andwentto afarmsupply.
Itlookslikehebought ammoniumnitrate.
And now they're all at Gerry's.
But it's Saturday?
And why do they need ammonium nitrate?
I don't know.
Me and Hernandez are heading over to meet the surveillance team at Gerry's now.
- What are you going to do?
- I don't know!
No!
No!
You can not raid them yet!
You don't even know if they have the cesium?
And Gerry's phone's off.
Okay, I have to go over there.
[Angela] No,Nate!
It--
- What are you doing here?
- I was calling, you didn't answer.
I got worried.
- Bullshit!
Why are you here?
- I just told you!
I'm gonna give you one more chance.
Okay, what the fuck is wrong with this guy?
I called three times, you didn't answer any of them!
I got worried something happened to you!
All right, put it down!
He's telling the truth!
- Were you followed?
- [Nate] No, I wasn't!
- Are you sure?
- Yes!
I was worried, so I was checking constantly!
Okay, calm down, everybody calm down.
Okay, can somebody tell me what is going on?
I sent David to do surveillance on your shop last night.
I saw an electrical crew go into the building across the street.
- [stuttering] So?
- In the middle of the night?
Could there be like a power problem?
No, they must have traced the TATP you ordered.
- Okay, if they're on to the shop...
- Fuck.
...they're on to you.
Are you sure you weren't followed?
- Yes!
- If he said he wasn't, he wasn't!
Stay calm and keep your eyes open.
Morgan, get back to work, please, Jesus.
We had to move forward, immediately.
It would have been only a matter of time before they were on to us, too.
And you weren't gonna let me know?
Nate, I'm sorry.
It's too risky.
Well, he's here now, let's get him to help!
What about the TATP?
David got ammonium nitrate instead.
He used his name, so the jig is up.
They'll know it's us.
[David] It's not gonna matter tomorrow.
We're in this to the end now, Nate.
Do you understand?
They're not gonna take us alive.
All right, let me help.
Okay, okay, good.
Come over here.
I should go wash up so I don't contaminate anything.
Oh...
Hey, Nate!
How are you?
[sniffling]
- Nate!
- The cesium is here!
All right, everyone!
Let's get ready to do this!
No!
Angela, you have to tell him to wait.
Wait?
No, no, no, we need to get in there now!
There are three guys in there with machine guns and they're building a bomb.
This is a residential neighborhood.
His wife and kids are in the house.
Ifyoucomeinhere now, it'llbeabloodbath .
This is a volatile situation.
Yeah, which is why we need to move now...
No, he doesn't get it!
These guys are fanatics!
They will not be taken alive!
Tom, you're not in there!
We have to listen to him.
And what the fuck happens if the explosives go off whilewe'rewaitingaround?
Nate,yougot60seconds todisarmthoseguys, becausewe'recomingin.
Okay, let's get these suits ready.
[Morgan] Okay, let's get ready to move!
We are almost done here!
Fuck!
The cesium spilled!
[yelling]
Shit, get the suits on!
Go, go, go!
Come on!
[yelling indistinct]
Come on, help me!
Help me!
Get zipped up!
Get zipped up!
Son of a...
Shit, come on!
- Come on, get your hood on!
- No!
No!
...stop!
Get the gun!
[all yelling]
It's me!
It's me!
It's me!
Are you okay?
You all right?
[all yelling]
- You all right?
- Yeah, no, I'm good, I'm good.
[Morgan] I know my rights!
I'm a patriot of the United States!
- [officer] Shut your fucking mouth!
- [Morgan] Fuck you!
[siren blaring] [officer] Come on, get up!
[helicopter overhead]
[all] Surprise!
[Nate] The paperwork came in...
Houston.
Yeah...
Texas.
Can you believe it?
Good margaritas, I hear.
Yeah.
[laughing]
Yeah, I'm gonna miss it here, though.
Well, "it's" going to miss you, too.
"This should have been a noble creature;
he hath all the energy which would have made a goodly frame of glorious elements, had they been wisely mingled."
Gerry?
Yeah, Gerry, and all of them, really.
Yeah, that's why you were the right guy for the job.
What do you mean?
Why do you think I picked you?
I knew that you would understand them.
And they'd understand you.
And the more authentic you became with them, the more authentic they'd become with you.
Because when it comes down to it, there really is only one essential ingredient to fascism.
[Johnny] It'svictimhood.
I blamed those black kids, and I blamed this school,
I blamed the cops;
I blamed everybody.
I was gonna hurt everyone else the way they hurt me.
I look at you guys and I see myself.
But you guys don't have to make the same mistakes I did.
You don't have to be victims.
Hey.
- Hey.
- Hey.
That was great.
Thanks.
Dude, thanks...
Thanks for coming by.
I'm so proud of you, Johnny.
[chuckles]
You know what they say...
It all begins with the word.
You have the phone?
ShouldI doit now?
Notyet.
Waituntil wegetto thecheckpoint.
Okay, guys, this is it.
Hey, Ivy league's gun, put that gun back away.
- What are you talking about?
- I don't need some egghead who just scored an 81 on his qual shooting my dick off, okay?
This is my fucking guy!
I'm not just gonna sit here while you-- guys, enough!
Nate, just follow our lead, okay?
Is your heart clear?
Areyousure youwantto do this?
The signal will be better outside.
Here it is.
Did it work?
- Drop it!
- Freeze!
- Hands in the air!
- Turn around!
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
You have the right to an attorney.
Hello,usman.

Icangetyou phonecallswith yourparents,yourfriends...

AndI don'thaveany friends.
Oh, wow, he's a real prince, this one.
Can I get in there?
Salam aleikum.
What the fuck, tom?
I have this room at 4:00!
I know you don't get a lot of news downstairs, zamparo, but we just broke up a massive terrorist plot, all right?
Try and keep up.
Um...
What?
What is it?
Sir, when I flagged up this guy's email,
I thought the investigation was only gonna proceed if there was substantive criminal evidence to back it up.
We've got hours of him talking about waging jihad and killing children.
Right, but talking, though, sir, not... he's not doing anything.
Isn't that the point?
Hey, Tim.
How's it going?
You celebrating something, Nate?
You seeing someone special, huh?
Uh, yeah, actually.
How'd you guess?
Genius, emergency meeting in the conference room!
The crash was off 301 around 2:00 last night.
Local police controlled the scene, so, thankfully, the press knows nothing.
These containers carried cesium-137.
It's used for radiotherapy applications in hospitals, but it's highly regulated and had no business being on that truck.
When we tracked the shipment back to Baltimore, the customs record showed eight containers, not two.
So there's six more of them out there, all of them in the country illegally.
If that quantity made it's way into a radiological device, we could be looking at thousands of casualties, mass evacuations and radioactive contamination throughout the D.C. area.
- Tom?
- Yeah.
Uh, lab analysis puts the cesium coming from north Africa.
So the guys on four, they put together this map.
It's an analysis of Muslim communities in DC, Maryland and Virginia, along with their countries of origin.
We'd like each-- yes?
What about leads on the dt front?
Well, given the cesium came from north Africa, we don't think domestic is really in the picture.
The last time anyone tried to build a dirty bomb on us soil was James cummings.
He was a white supremacist living in Maine, he was going to set it off at Obama's inauguration.
He had uranium, thorium, and he was trying to acquire cesium.
I'm sure you're familiar with the case.
It goes without saying, anyone here is welcome to pursue any leads they think are fruitful.
Okay, would you fucking stop- oh, I'm so sorry.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- I'm Angela zamparo.
- Nate foster.
- I know.
You got a couple minutes?
Dt's downstairs.
There's only one perk to being down in this shithole.
Nicorette just isn't the same.
So, Nate...
You seem like you've got a bit more going on than most around here.
You remember Oklahoma city?
Well, yeah, i guess I was five, but sure.
What do you know about Timothy McVeigh?
Ah... he was some kind of lone extremist in a militia?
Don't be an asshole who bullshits questions you don't know the answer to.
Here.
Timothy McVeigh was a decorated Gulf war veteran.
He was not insane;
He was not a lunatic;
And he was not stupid.
He was a white supremacist, following a plan.
- What plan?
- A plan from a book called the Turner diaries.
It's about a "race war" to exterminate blacks, Jews, and "mud people."
You know how the war gets started?
The hero drives a truck bomb into a federal building.
Timothy McVeigh was reenacting that scene from the Turner diaries.
He was carrying the book with him when he was arrested.
What he was trying to do was start the race war.
You're focused on the islamic guys.
I get it.
We all create a narrative based on what we think is important.
We see what we want to see.
But just because you're not looking at something doesn't mean it's not there.
So, why are you telling me this?
I'm talking about a blood andguts,in thestreet, killorbe killedracewar.
Ihaveinformation abouta truckaccident outsideDClastnight, involvingclassified radioactivematerial.
ButnowtheFBI istrying tocoverit allup.
Why ?
Becausesomething bigishappening, andit'sbiggerthan9/11 , andit'sbiggerthan Oklahomacity.
Sobewarned, bearmed,andbeready.
His name is Dallas wolf.
He gets 20,000 listeners a night.
We believe he's based just outside of DC, but almost nobody knows him personally.
But I have an informant, a skinhead in a gang.
And the leader of that gang is friends with wolf.
So I need someone to get in there, and get close to him.
Right and I'm trying to tell you that this is not my thing!
I barely passed the pft!
What do you think undercover work is?
Beating guys up and shooting at them?
No, it's people skills.
It's controlling situations.
- It's this.
- Seriously?
This is the only undercover training you'll ever need.
I saw you with that Muslim kid.
You got most of this going on anyway.
Look, I read your file.
High IQ, great people skills, but not your typical FBI profile.
Introverted, an outsider, unhappy childhood.
Single mother, always moving around a lot, always the new kid, bullied at school, no close friends or-- okay, okay, okay, fuck you!
That's... this is an invasion.
What gives you the right to look-- because we don't have time to dick around here!
You don't smuggle a boatload of cesium into the country and then just let it fucking sit there!
Fine, but I'm trying to tell you,
I don't have the skills for this!
I can't even defend myself!
You do have the skills, and they mean you will never have to!
What did you say to that kid?
"You want to change things, so nobody has to suffer the way you did."
Adirtybomb isanykindofcrude, explosivedevice thatwhendetonated, dispersesradiation aroundandbeyondthe blast.

Are you out of your fucking mind?
Do you know how management looks at undercover, Nate?
You think this office is bad?
They'll have you chasing pedophiles on an Indian reservation.
I just want to discuss the option, sir.
Discuss the option?
Of what, of killing your whole career?

Youknowwhata"necktie"is?
They slit your throat, and they pull your tongue right out through it?
Oh, shut the fuck up!
Oh, what, so you want him to go in blind, so he has no idea what he's getting into?
You're just trying to manipulate him!
And you're not?
You do whatever the fuck you want.
But you better think long and hard about this.

And I want to make a difference.
Okay.
Not bad.
What else?
What's this?
It's my dd-214.
I was up all night Photoshop-ing it, so if anyone wants to see proof of my service in the marines, they can just-- what the fuck are you doing?
No, no, no, no.
Listen to me.
If you get yourself in a situation where you have to show somebody your dd-214, then you're already done.
You understand?
Good.
Now what else?
Loneextremism isnotasocialphenomena, it'sa tactic.

Principle #3:
Arouse in the other person an eager want.
So what do they want from you?
My loyalty?
I'm loyal, I'm dedicated to the the cause.
No.
Any thug can be loyal.
What do you have...
What the guys with the cesium... are gonna want?
Welcome to medvale medical supply company.
My military contacts helped me start this business.
Most of our sales are online.
Our radiotherapy products are specifically designed for the handling and storing of radioactive material.
So we can acquire sensitive materials and hide them.
Hisnameis frankhedges.
He'sbeenacifortwoyears.
He's in a gang called the panzer strikeforce, and the leader of the gang is this guy.
Vince sargent.
He's friends with Dallas wolf.
So Vince and Dallas wolf are tight?
Yeah, I told you, Vince calls into wolf's show every week.
Sofrankbringsyou intothegang, youhangout, getsomecredibility, youmaketheseguyslike you.
YougetclosetoVince.
Then,youusehim togetto knowwolf.
This is my friend Nate i was telling you about.
Hey, everybody.
14/88, brother.
Good to meet you.
All right, spread 'em.
Roy does our security.
Okay, fine.
Whoa, whoa, hey, what the fuck is that?
- What's what?
- That!
Under your fucking shirt there!
What is that?
Hey, are you a cop?
Hey, look me in my fucking eyes, boy!
Are you a fucking cop?
- No, I'm not.
- No?
Whoo!
He's fine.
Sorry about that, Nate.
But you know how it is.
- Yeah, absolutely.
- Whoa, whoa.
Have a seat.
You drink bud?
Uh, yeah, absolutely.
Frank tells me you were in Iraq.
Uh, yeah, three years in the corps.
- You kill anybody?
- Johnny!
He's Johnny.
He's a fresh cut.
We're trying to teach him the ropes.
I know the fuckin' ropes, man.
Yeah, then mind your fucking manners!
So, did you?
Kill anybody?
I don't talk about that.
But what I did see was a lot of our guys go down.
Good guys... friends.
And for what?
I was on a wmd squad, the whole reason we were there, except we didn't find shit, did we?
Hmm.
So then I get home, i started listening to Dallas wolf.
Oh, yeah?
Dallas and I go way back.
Oh, there's a guy I'd love to meet, you know.
He's somebody who's telling the truth.
He's out there, he's asking why were we there?
And the answer's always the same.
Iraq, 9/11, osama bin laden, what does it all come back to?
Look at every war we've ever been in.
How many white men slaughtered their brothers in world war ii?
What, like a 100 million?
And for who?
Who's always pulling the strings?
It's all here in front of us.
But most people are blind.
Look at this bottle.
You see anything funny?
You're talking about the Jew tax?
What's the Jew tax?
Tell 'em, Nate.
Start looking at the food you buy, and you'll see this little "u."
The union of orthodox rabbis gets paid to perform a "blessing" on everything in the grocery store.
For this "blessing," they rake in billions of dollars in taxes.
We can't control the ketchup, but we can control the streets.
That's how it went down in Germany.
And we think of ourselves as a sturm abteilung.
We are a thinking man's soldiers.
First here.
And then here.
And that is where the revolution starts.
We're not these tired old kkk guys, waiting for some catastrophe to start a race war.
- We're the catastrophe.
- That's fucking right.
And we need guys like you, with military backgrounds.
We need best practices in our security.
Come on, man, I think our fucking security is pretty good.
Well, always room to improve, though, right?
Oh, yeah?
Like what?
Well, like, look at the position of this booth and then tell me, without looking, where the nearest exits are.
- What's your point?
- The point is, of all the large booths in this restaurant, you picked the one farthest from the exits.
If something goes down, we're fucked.
No, we're ready for whatever goes down.
Yeah, with only you and him, i don't know your name yet, I'm sorry, carrying?
Oh, and how the fuck you think you know that?
When you pat someone down so they're facing everybody's lap, it's pretty easy to tell.
You spend three years in Iraq, you learn how to scan a room.
And see threats.
Well, isn't that fucking impressive.
Now I only got one question for you.
What?
Why are you wearing levis?
Levis?
Your fucking Jew jeans?
Yeah, no, sorry, i just couldn't help notice when I was patting' you down.
While you were doing your little detective work all up in everybody's lap.
So why are you wearing them?
Because when i got home from Iraq, my brother gave me these jeans... as a homecoming gift.
Now, does he understand the struggle we're in?
No.
But I'm sure as shit not gonna let a zionist conglomerate keep me from wearing them.
You wanna boycott the Jews?
You ever look at the fortune 500?
You'll be living in a fucking cave.
He's right.
Shit, they probably own this place, too.
Frank tells me you run a medical supply company now?
Yeah.
Yeah, my military contacts helped me set up.
We're just starting out, but we got access to a lot of stuff.
That's great.
I'd love to talk to you about that sometime.
Yeah... anytime.
You know, when I was 13, i actually played soccer.
One day, I came into the locker room, right?
And there were these six niggers, and they had this friend of mine, this Irish kid, down in the stalls, right?
His head was up against the toilet, and his face was just covered,
I mean, covered in blood, like flaps of skin.
I'd never seen anyone get beaten like that.
And when I came in, they just stared at me.
They stared, and I...
I walked away...
And just left him.
I hated those motherfuckers.
Yeah, when I was your age, i got pushed around a lot.
- Yeah?
- It fucking sucks.
But you can use that.
Yeah, but with these guys, nobody can do shit to me.
I learned to be proud.
Strong!
- Yeah, but-- - to be an Aryan fucking warrior!
Isn't that right, Johnny?
All right, so what, are we gonna stand around all night
- or we gonna get fucking drunk!
- Let's go!
Come on, junior, let's get some fucking beer, motherfucker!
Come on, boy!
Get in there, boy!
Hey, Nate, you know what, man?
Everybody seems to really fucking like you.
Yeah.
Thisismy friendNate Iwastellingyou about.
Hey,everybody.

Somethingbigis happening.
Inthebeginningwas the word.
Bearmedandbeready.
- Hey!
- Hey.
What's the matter, man?
You didn't hear me?
I just... uh...
You sleep well?
What's wrong?
Oh, yeah, no, we know where you live.
- Yup.
- Right.
Cool.
Yeah, so, what, you're not gonna invite us in?
Yeah, come on in.
Oh, thanks, man, so sweet of you.
It's a mess, sorry.
Welcome.
You mind?
Yeah, it's a cool place, man.
Yeah, but it kind of looks like you just moved in.
So, what are you guys doing here?
Aw, don't break my heart.
What are we doing here?
Come on, don't make it sound like you're not happy to see me.
See Vince is outside.
He's got a little surprise for you.
Oh, hey, well, um...
Yeah, well, I'm ready.
Let's go.
You're gonna be psyched, man!
It's fucking awesome!
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Cool, well, I'm good to go.
Let's head out.
- Let's go, Roy.
- What's the rush?
I'm coming.
What the fuck?
What the fuck is that?
Goddamn, man, you got some fucking shitty-ass furniture up in here, huh?
Yep.
Cheap as shit.
- All right, you ready?
- Yeah, I'm ready.
Sieg heil, motherfucker, let's go.
Sieg fucking hell.
Youdidn't finishyourtranscript.
Yeah,I know,I'llget toit.
Lookatmy fuckingarm !
Andwhatthefuck isgoingon withthisguyRoy?
You make him look small, you make him into an enemy.
Sometimes, Angela, it would just be great to hear, "good job."
I'm only so hard on you because I'm trying to protect you.
You have to remember your objective here.
This is about getting to Dallas wolf.
So what do I do about that?
Try relating to these guys as human beings.
You know?
Open up to them, if you can.
You may have more in common with them than you think.
Man, why the fuck does Vince make us come to this shit?
"Good networking, lots of movement guys." I mean, who gives a fuck?
Well, is Dallas wolf gonna be here?
Who the fuck knows?
I don't listen to that talk radio bullshit.
Fuck!
Goddamn.
Hey, that looks good on you, man.
Yeah, thanks.
Um, just go in,
I got another shirt in the cargo.
Hi, you must be Vince's friend Nate!
- I'm Becky, Gerry's wife.
- Oh, hi, nice to meet you.
- Such a pleasure to have you.
- Thank you for having me.
Yeah, of course.
Hey, Nate, i made some cupcakes.
The frosting is a little messed up, but they taste good.
So,Dallas,we wanted...
Nate!
Come check this out.
Isittrue, thisDallaswolfunityrally isthelargestevent you'vehostedin years?
Absolutely.
We'vebroughttogether thebiggestwhiteseparatist organizations in the northeast.
Andwe'realso havinga conference, withsomeof theworld's preeminentracialscholars.

They'replanningon viciouslyattacking peacefuldemonstrators withhockeysticks andd batteries andurineballoons.
Notonlythat.
They'rebusingin hundreds of protestors from the DC area.
ButallIcan say is, theaflbetterbecareful.
Because while we come in peace, we'recertainly notafraidof war.
Fuck.
Yeah.
God, that's the first I'm hearing about this rally.
I mean, god knows you can't get any real news on the yidivision, but still...
Are you planning on going, Nathan?
And this is Andrew Blackwell from the Aryan alliance.
- Hail victory, brother.
- Hail victory.
The Aryan alliance, huh?
I've read a lot about you guys.
Well, we're the premiere white nationalist group in the world, so that's not surprising.
Earnest walton, grand dragon, good to meet you.
Good to meet you.
Earnest is with the local klan.
Yeah, you should stop by one of our meetings.
- We'd love to have you.
-
- Oh, wow.
You should check out our website, too.
We're always looking for quality people.
Ah, I don't think Nate's into all that religious stuff.
Excuse me?
Religious stuff?
I just think Nate is a little more rational than that.
I'm not sure I know what you mean by that.
Come on, Nate.
Let's go back and get some food.
Stay away from those faggots.
They got this fucked up religion where they think the Bible was written for white men and aryans are the lost tribes of Israel.
The Bible.
Jews invented christianity.
Jews invented the printing press, and the Bible is the most published book in the world.
I mean, anything seem off to you?
How about the fact the romans conquered every mud race on earth, and then christianity finished them off in a hundred years?
You gotta know who to stick with in this movement.
You're with us.
Goddamn it, Vince, every time we come here, the whole fuckin' place is dry!
- What the fuck, man?
- It's two hours, be good.
Gerry, there's somebody I want you to meet.
This is Nate.
- Hey, Gerry Conway.
- Nate Thomas, nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.
Vince told me all about you.
Make yourself at home.
I am throwing on some veggie burgers.
Thanks for having us.
- Hi!
- Hey, hey, I'm Nate.
- Madeline.
Nice to meet you.
- Hey, Madeline.
- This is Timmy.
- Hey, Timmy.
You want to come see our tree house?
Uh, yeah, sure, where are we going?
Oh, right, yeah, there.
Oh, wow, that is great!
Did your dad build this?
- I built it!
- You built this?
- But my daddy helped.
- Okay.
Wow.
- It's to protect us.
- Yeah, from what?
If the mud people come.
Always be ready.
Always be watchful and stick together.
You guys kidnapping my guest?
- Huh?
Huh?
This is amazing, man.
Well, I've always been good with my hands.
And it was just wonderful to have a project with the kids.
You know how you spell love, Nate?
T-i-m-e.
Ninety percent of the time you'll ever spend with your kids
- comes before the age of 12.
- Wow.
Yeah.
You been in the movement long, Nate?
Um, not long.
Just since i got back from Iraq.
Oh, yeah, right.
Yeah, Vince told me you served.
- Mm-hm.
- Mm-hm.
Hey, Nate, don't take this the wrong way but you kind of seem a little mature for a skinhead.
Really?
Yeah.
Yeah, maybe.
I don't know.
Um, what about you?
You seem to know a lot of people in this movement.
Ah, they probably come for the free food.
Ah, no.
You have these barbecues often?
Yeah, as much as I can, yes, you know,
I try to create a positive environment for everybody in the community, and a place for us to come together and be healthy in body and spirit.
"Fuck you, bitch!" And he turned around, and he's like-- guys!
Guys!
Language, please.
Kids.
Jesus fucking Christ.
It makes me so sad to see those two.
They gotta clean up their act.
Well, how do you mean?
Well, the cigarettes, and alcohol, the language.
This is what's happening to our young Aryan men.
Yeah.
To be honest, now that I met you,
I'm kind of surprised you invited those guys.
Well, you can't exclude them.
I mean, they're the next generation.
They need our help.
Need to understand their heritage, and be proud of it.
That's what it's all about, isn't it?
The children.
What kind of a world will they grow up in?
Goddamn, man, that was the worst fucking party on earth.
Jesus Christ, what kind of bullshit vodka is this, man?
Man, that's the last time i ever let you pick it out.
Man, look at that shit.
Look at that!
That is just fucking...
God, that is so fucking awful!
Man, look at that, look at that beautiful Aryan woman and that fucking...
Roy, come on, let's go the fuck home.
No, no, man, we're gonna teach these two a lesson.
- No!
- Get your fucking hands off of me!
Don't you ever fucking touch me again.
You hear me?
We're Aryan warriors, right?
That means we got a responsibility to do something about shit like this.
Hey, you two!
You need to get the fuck out of here!
Hold on, what did you say?
I said, get the fuck out of here or we're gonna kill you, you fucking spic!
What the fuck is your problem?
- What's our problem?
-
- Yeah.
You come into our country, you fuck our women.
Yeah, you got some big fucking balls, huh?
- Put the fucking knife down and calm down, all right, man?
- Oh, my god!
They get the point.
You thought you were a big man, huh?
He gets it, Roy!
He's fucking shaking.
I thought you were a big man.
- Put the fucking knife down!
- Fuck you, motherfucker!
I'll fucking gut you, you piece of shit!
Now go, fucker!
- Come on, let's go!
- Shit!
Fuck, Nate.
Goddamn it!
You're fucking lucky!
What the fuck is your problem?
You fucked the whole thing up!
Yeah, I think they got the message, Roy!
Got the message?
Are you a fucking idiot?
Man, those two were mine!
And then your dumb fucking ass decides...
Hang on, wait a minute...
First you tried to stop me, then you try to scare them off, and then you set off that fucking alarm.
That wasn't an accident, was it?
Was it, Nate?
You wanted them to get away.
What the fuck, Nate?
Huh?
I said what the fuck?
Okay, you're goddamn right i wanted them to get away!
You want to be a soldier, Roy and not a fucking thug?
Then think!
You think about security cameras, Roy?
You think about the liquor store we were just in?
You think about the clerk or the license plates on my fucking truck?
You think about any of that shit?
Fucking Aryan warrior...
A hundred spics and niggers ain't worth the life of one white man, but go ahead, put us all in prison.
That's how you're gonna win your race war?
Huh?
Fuck!
All right, whatever, can we just get back on the road and get the fuck out of here?
Fuck!
Iranthoselicenseplates.
Anaccountant,aschool teacher,a lawyer,fireman, he'sanengineer, not a criminal record in sight, butAndrewBlackwell, he'sa differentstory.
Whyishe here?
Uh, he said he was going to wolf's rally.
He's the national director of the Aryan alliance.
They're based in Ohio, he wouldn't just come all this way to be in a rally.
Wait, if wolf is involved in this, he can't be doing it alone, right?
I mean, he'd need help, and organization.
Exactly, so you need to figure out how wolf and Blackwell are connected, and why he's really here.
Vince, good to see you.
Rich, can we get some literature, please?
- White power.
- White power.
Okay, we're gettin' ready to get started here.
Can everyone take a seat?
MosttimesI'dtalkedtoyou,

Butwhataboutthe future?
Whatdowe dreamof?

I'lltellyou.
It will be a world like the one that shaped our race in Europe.
Aworldof forests, mountains,andlakes.
Nota worldof concrete, asphalt,andgarbage.
Andinsteadof 300million race-lessmulattos, breedingandinfesting.
Imaginea continent of50millionwhiteEuropeans.

That'stheworldIsee.

That'sthenation wecanbuild...together.
If you take millions of white people, and flood every country in Africa with them, what do they call that?
Genocide.
But what's happening to every white country on earth?
You've got affirmative action that kills white jobs.
Abortion, that kills white babies.
Gay rights, that kill white families.
Folks, let me explain something to you.
"Diversity" is a code word.
And what it means is white genocide!
So, we'll begin marching at the courthouse.
And after two blocks-- wait a minute, wait a minute.
This is not the order that we agreed to.
Aryan alliance is supposed to be heading this march.
Now just a second, Andrew.
You know, we're at this rally every year, and we start with the colonial patriots.
Well, this isn't "every year," is it?
To be fair, Harris, maybe we should.
You're a local organization...
Vince, can you introduce me to Dallas?
"The klan"?
You're not "the klan."
Yeah, sure.
Come on, let's go.
You're the "invisible white knights" of the ku klux klan!
Which is what, the third klan group in the DC Metro area?
!
Hey, Dallas!
Good to see you.
It's... it's Vince, Vince sargent?
Right, Vince.
Good to see you.
Good to see you.
I want to introduce you to my good friend, this is Nate Thomas.
- I'm a huge fan of your show.
- Thank you, sir.
If you'll excuse me.
I have to get ready for the march.
- Uh, Mr. wolf?
- Yes, what is it?
I didn't want to get into this in front of Vince, but I'd like to talk to you about an investment.
- An "investment"?
- Mm-hm.
I represent a few people who are big fans of yours, and they want to help.
- Is that so?
- Yes, sir.
They have a number of assets in the online media space, and they feel the potential for your show is being limited by your advertising budget.
They want to help you penetrate some new markets, and they see no reason why you can't go nationwide.
Well, that is great, son.
That is just great.
Here, call this number and we'll talk.
Okay, great.
That sounds great, Mr. wolf.
- Call me, Dallas.
- Thank you.
Racist scum!
Racist scum!
We're here today because we're proud of our race!
We love our race!
And we're here to say that.
- White power!
-
- White power!
The white race is under attack in this country.
- White rights!
-
- White rights!
But nobody seems to give a damn!
- White freedom!
-
- White freedom!
- Where's al sharpton?
-
- Fuckin' rednecks!
Where's Jesse Jackson to fight for white rights!
- White power!
-
- White power!
White equality!
- White pride!
-
- White pride!
If you're white, and you are standing over there...
- White freedom!
-
- White freedom!
...you're on the wrong side of that barricade!
- White rights!
-
- White rights!
Nate!
Wake up, white people!
Wake up!
- White power!

- White power!
It's morning in America and there's a new day coming.

Come join the white race!
White race!

Racist scum!
Racist scum!
Racist bum!
It's the fucking afl.
Don't worry, they won't do shit.
Well, well, well, if it isn't the American fucking losers!
Yeah, fuck you!
Why don't you come over the fucking barricade, motherfuckers!
Johnny!
Hey, man, just fucking stay back, okay?
- Don't fucking do it.
- I gotta help him.
Help him by not getting the fuck arrested, okay?
- Fucking pussies!
-
- White Nazi scum!
Yeah, you know what?
I can do that shit, too.
I'm gonna fucking kill you, motherfucker!
- Do not engage.
Do not engage.
- You think I'm playing around?
I'm gonna fucking kill you!
Get your hands off of me!
I'm gonna kill these motherfuckers!
Stay back!
- White power!
-
- White pride!
- White power!
-
- White pride!
He hit me in the fucking eye!
It's fucking piss!
Johnny!
Andrew, can you walk?
Get the fuck outta here.
You okay?
Everyone okay?
Sorry.
Okay.
Stay with us.
I'm getting you out of here, man.
Go... go right, go right!
Oh, fuck!
- Fuck!
- Fucking...
Holy shit!
We gotta go!
We gotta fucking go!
I can't fucking go anywhere!
Stay down!
Fuck!
No, don't get up.
You need to rest.
I brought you some chamomile tea.
It'll help you relax.
Thank you.
There's our wounded warrior.
How you feeling, buddy?
Yeah, much better.
Thank you, guys.
Ah, no problem.
I'm gonna put some music on.
I brought you Sammy to keep you company.
Thanks.
Oh, wow.
You like it?
I...
I love brahms.
See, Becky, i knew he was quality.
I think the fourth is my favorite.
Yeah, mine, too.
Except maybe the-- the first?
Yeah.
Now listen, if you like brahms,
I've got this clarinet quintet that will blow your mind.
They're dead, Gerry.
Dead.
I'm gonna find them, and we're gonna string them up-- alright, I hear ya.
I hear ya.
That's why I avoid the political stuff.
Not my thing.
Besides, I've heard it can be dangerous.
That was fantastic.
Thank you...
I thought you guys were vegetarians.
Everybody's gotta have a few vices every now and then.
What's "vices"?
Oh, boy, there we go!
I'm sorry about that, that's my ride.
Gerry, Becky, thanks for everything.
Nathan, I don't know what to say.
I owe you, big time.
Why don't you stop by the compound some time.
Oh, I'm not really in Ohio that much, but I'd love to if I ever am.
No, I meant the...
The new one.
- Oh.
- Here in Virginia.
Oh, right, yeah, please, I'd love to.
- Bye.
- Have a good night.
Bye, Andrew!
Well, listen, you're not going to believe it, but when it comes to tchaikovsky...
Gotta go with Bernstein.
- Leonard Bernstein?
- I know, I know.
Gerry, I hate to break it to you, man--
I know.
Listen, I can't help it, he's a great conductor.
Jews listen to Wagner, don't they?
So, Gerry, if you don't mind my asking, how did you end up in the movement?
Listen, for me, it was the books.
My parents were practically liberals.
Totally blinded by the zog.
You know, I always knew something was wrong;
and I had this anger,
I couldn't put my finger on it, until here.
It all started with this.
I was 13.
Read it in four days.
It explains race, culture, capitalism and how democracy destroyed western civilization.
Democracy:
"Three people form a government.
Then two of them vote to steal the wealth of the third."
- David Lane, right?
- Mm-hm.
Now here's something more recent.
You'll love this.
This breaks down the entire worldwide zionist conspiracy, step by step.
- You can bring it back.
- Oh, no, I couldn't.
Nate, Nate, please.
But that was it?
I mean, it was just books woke you up?
Well, you know, i had my theories.
And then a three-month engineering contract opened up in Kenya.
I was young, i wanted to see the world.
And, uh, Nate, listen,
I got no problem with them having their own country, everybody should.
But if you go there, and you see, they weren't even living like animals.
You know, animals don't live in their own feces, do they?
So, if you ever have any doubt white men created civilization, just go have a look.
Hey.
So,howwasthe brahms?
Howdoyoureason withsomeonelikethat?

This suspect, he was a fucking nightmare.
He was grabbing my ass, the whole thing.
And he kept insisting i go to this club with him, where I knew he was gonna make his big move, but if I didn't go, then, you know, I could blow my whole cover.
So what did you do?
So we're at a bar, and I tell him I want oysters.
So I get a dozen, i start plowing through them.
Then I start acting queasy.
I run to the bathroom, stick my finger down my throat.
- No way!
- Yeah!
So now there's puke all over my dress,
I tell him I got sick off the oysters and take a cab home.
Two days later, he was arrested.
- That is fucking awesome.
- Oh, it was fucked up.
But there was the thrill, you know?
That high.
God, there's nothing like it.
Yeah, so why'd you stop?
It was just it's no way to live, the paranoia, the tension.
And I wanted to spend more time with my kids.
You got kids?
You don't think I'm mommy material?
No, no... no.
Yeah, I got two princesses.
Mommy and daddy.
Perfect, little suburban life.
Anyway, I know how lonely this work can be.
But the case won't go forever.
You can't change the way people think, but you are making a difference.
Nathan, good to see you.
Can we get you anything, coffee?
Oh, no, I'm good, thanks.
This is a great set-up you got here.
Yeah, thanks.
All right, let's give you the tour.
This parcel is actually pretty small, but we're purchasing the one next to it.
Although, citizen's groups are trying to block us out.
Oh, yeah.
How are you handling that?
Well, we tell them we're here to stay.
Make no mistake about it.
We show up at their homes, their businesses, their churches.
They backed down pretty quick after that.
So you're moving the national headquarters?
No, we're keeping the compound in Ohio, it's just with everything going on right now, we needed a stronger presence here.
You know?
- Is that your firing range?
- Yeah, come on.
It's a little primitive, but we're working on it.
I'm no marksman, by any means, but I have some expertise in range design, just from training the Iraqi police.
What's your danger area template?
To contain your cone of fire.
I mean, how do you control your overshoot?
Uh...
We haven't gotten to that yet.
Okay, well, you might want to make sure it's the kikes and niggers getting hit and not your guys.
Absolutely.
Maybe if you have time,
- you could talk to the guys about it.
- Yeah, sure,
I need to see what kind of equipment you've got, but I'm happy to.
Okay.
Uh, come on up here.
Right now were just using this for storage.
- Are those cots?
- Yup.
We'll be able to sleep 200 in there.
And we're gonna need to.
I'm not gonna beat around the bush.
You see the type of organization we have here, but we could always use a man like you, Nathan.
Educated, war veteran, clean record.
I mean, hell, you don't even have any parking tickets.
Yeah, we have our contacts in law enforcement, local, state, federal, not to mention military hospitals, laboratories, you name it.
And so what's the overall objective here?
I mean, are you just trying to get the message out, or what?
Get the... get the message out?
To who?
We're not trying to recruit the public here.
What would we do with them?
They're at home sitting on their asses,
- watching sitcoms and surfing Facebook.
This is revolutionary activity we're talking about here.
Look, I'm flattered by the interest, but, you know,
I've been around the movement awhile now and a lot of these guys are all talk.
Now for me to really want to get involved,
I need to know there's bigger things going on here.
No offense.
Yeah... none taken.
All right...
Take a look at this.
This is the entire DC water system.
Plants, pipelines, the whole deal.
Now, Nathan, the guys you're hanging out with, they're all talk, because they're punks.
They're amateurs.
They sit around drinking beer all day, maybe they beat up a few niggers or each other.
We got no use for them.
We need men like you.
Can I help you?
I'm looking for Dallas wolf, but I must have the wrong house.
Oh, no, he's here.
Come in.
Randy!
Someone's here!
Hey, Nate.
The studio's back here.
I'm moving studios right now, so this is all temporary.
Oh, no, this is a great setup.
Thanks for taking the time to see me, Dallas.
I just spent the afternoon with Andrew at the Aryan alliance.
Oh, yeah?
Andrew's great.
They have an incredible organization.
Yeah, they seem really serious about the struggle.
About doing whatever it takes.
They're true patriots, those guys.
Well, let me give you a bit of background on me.
I was in Iraq for three years, on a wmd squad.
And then when I got back, my military contacts helped me set up a medical supply company.
V-a-l-e.
Wow, this is great.
Yeah, we do it all, from bandages and syringes to X-ray and radiotherapy equipment.
And with the highly regulated stuff, we can cut through a lot of the red tape and deal directly, and discreetly.
Fantastic, Nate.
Great to know.
So... you'd also mentioned an investment?
For the show?
Yes, I've got an investor lined up who's very excited about expanding your reach.
We're talking advertising, marketing, bigger servers...
That's exactly what I need.
So how do I meet him?
Well, a lot of my military contacts don't like to publicize their efforts.
But he'd love for you to put together a proposal about how you'd expand the show.
Funny you should mention that.
I've been trying to raise $7,500 to break into the Florida market.
They're ripe right now, with all the immigration stuff.
Yeah... yeah, this is great!
So, there's one more thing.
Go ahead, shoot.
The reason he's helping you is because he feels that you are a man of action, as he is.
As I am.
Right, sure.
So for him to move forward, he needs to know you're serious about this.
Nate, I've been ready to give my life for this cause for 20 years now.
What I need is the right people behind me.
So you tell your investor that if he wants action, he's got the right guy.
Um, sorry, Dallas, I've got kind of a long drive back, you mind if I hit the head?
The whole case is about to blow wide open!
He's in with wolf, he's in with the Aryan alliance.
Yeah, and all we need to keep wolf on the line is that $7,500!
Let me get this straight.
So after everything we spent on your cover, even after the medical supply business, you want me to ask for $7,500 asan"investment" inthisguy'sradioshow ?
You're the only one with a budget right now!
Oh, yeah, I'm just flush with cash!
I'm trying to run a 40-man investigation ontopof allthe shit I'vealreadygot!
Sir, the alliance is building a compound outside DC.
Wolf's house is setting off a geiger counter!
I spent six hours last night reading your transcripts,
Nate, you don't have shit!
Youdon'thaveshit!
Look at how much carbon is built up on this bolt.
- See?
See that?
Like-- - yeah.
That's unacceptable.
When's the last time you cleaned this?
I've been meaning to get to most of them.
Okay, guys, seriously!
Okay, so we got an ar-15, serial number a00724, needs a new buffer spring.
Come on, guys, let's go!
We need to go through the whole inventory.
Andrew's waiting on this.
I'm gonna have to tell Andrew, the only way it's gonna change is with new policies.
And how do I know it's not me you're trying to fuck?
Fuck you, you calling us liars?
You get on the phone yourself!
Call them up and ask them...
Hey, guys...
Hey, Nate...
It's been a while.
Yeah, you kinda disappeared on us.
I'm sorry about that, Vince.
I've been kind of busy.
Yeah, I bet you have.
Seems like you made a bunch of new friends around here, huh?
See, we were just wondering if maybe you could explain--
Roy!
Thanks for stopping by.
Be seeing you, Nate.
What was that all about?
Roy says the police have been following him.
He's paranoid about infiltrators.
Infiltrators, huh?
Yeah.
Mm.
That's why the police are on his ass?
Have you seen how that guy behaves?
It's a miracle he's not in jail already.
Right, uh, you want to help us with something?
Sure, what's up?
I'm throwing a youth event for Hitler's birthday.
There's a campground a couple miles from here.
- Help us scout it.
- Sounds good.
It's amazing how much land there is right outside DC.
Let me ask you something, Nathan.
What's your opinion on infiltration?
Well, how do you mean?
How do we prevent it?
Well, it's tough.
For one thing, you gotta keep guys with rap sheets out of important positions.
That's... that's how they flip most people.
We have a polygraph back at the compound.
Maybe we should make everybody take it.
I mean, i think someone who's trained can beat a polygraph without blinking.
Yeah, maybe we should just do a background checks for everybody.
Get everyone's records and documents together?
Yeah, I mean, for informants, that might work.
But for law enforcement, they just forge whatever they need.
Yeah, but with a few phone calls, you know, a cover only runs so deep.
Do you suspect someone?
You know, it's like they say at these rallies.
You look to the left, look to the right, one of these people is a snitch.
It's the left.
Turn left right up here.
You okay there, Nate?
You look a little off?
No, I'm good.
Just, uh, tired...
Been a long day.
Well, I think this is a great location.
What do you think?
Yeah, I like it.
Uh, well, what about the permits, though?
We tell them we're a Christian organization, holding a youth event.
I gotta ask you something.
Roy said he contacted the nprc.
Said there's no record of you having served in the marines.
You mean Roy went and filed a 180 with a government that he fucking hates, just to... okay.
I was on a wmd squad, so that's black ops.
And he knows that, the fucker.
Wait, hold on, are you guys taking this seriously?
Is that what that was all about in the truck?
Because, I understand you have to do your due diligence or whatever, but that's a fucking serious accusation!
I don't need to take that shit from anybody!
- Hey... hey, hey!
- Least of all from--
okay.
Let's get out of here.
Nate,listen.
Weneedtogettheserial numbers first,andthen- - no, look, I don't have time for that!
What if he wasn't convinced?
What if he calls wolf?
The account name is Nate foster, please.
You don't know if he was convinced!
You don't even know if they talk, okay?
You're being-- yeah, I'd like $7,500 in cash.
You're a man of your word, which is a rare thing in this movement.
So, listen, Dallas, my investor is very excited, but he wants to know some more about what you're planning, some details.
Oh, okay, I think it was all in the presentation, but we start with online in tampa, and then we move down the- no, no, I mean, beyond that.
- Beyond Florida?
Beyond the show, like what we talked about.
The actions we're gonna take.
I'm sorry, Nate.
I lost you.
What do you mean?
What I mean is, you have been talking a lot about a lot of big things that are coming.
Bigger than Oklahoma city, bigger than 9/11-- oh, yeah, for sure.
Which is why expanding the show is so important.
Right, and I have been spending a lot of time with Andrew at the Aryan alliance.
He told me you'd been working together.
Well, yeah, sure, i mean, he came to the rally.
No, no, what my investor needs to know is what are the concrete steps that you are taking to start the race war.
As I said to you before,
I have the expertise, the connections, the tools.
Maybe there's some kind of misunderstanding.
I thought we were talking about expanding the show.
Yeah, which my investor is happy to do, but if you're not willing to be honest about the other actions you're taking, then he's not gonna be able to support you.
Okay, Nate, fair enough.
Sorry it didn't work out.
I saw the plans, Dallas, for the water system.
Andrew showed them to me, okay?
So, I know all about it, and now I just need you to stop pretending and be honest with me.
This is private property.
You're no longer welcome here.
I'm asking you to leave.
Come on, Dallas.
I'm on your side.
Get the fuck out.
Now.
Fuck.
We'regoingto theoffice,
Dallaswolfis there.
Youbroughthimin?
No.
Hecametous.
Sir.
I didn't know you'd be here.
Has anyone talked to him?
No, no, of course not.
No, it's your show.
So, Dallas.
Or should I call you Randy?
That is your real name.
You can call me whatever you like, agent zamparo.
Any reason you're using an assumed name?
I'm a public entertainer.
Ah... fine.
So, tell me why you're here today.
I'm here because of the guy I called about.
He shows up at my conference, talking about investing in my show.
Butthen,he 'stellingme howhecanget highlyregulateditems.

That's a lot.

Right.
Let me play you something, okay, Randy.
Ihaveinformation abouta truckaccident outsideDClastnight, involvingclassified radioactivematerial, butnowtheFBI istrying tocoverit allup.
Why ?
You've gotta be kidding me.
It's a radio show.
It's entertainment!
So you think it's entertaining to predict and incite terrorist attacks?
Whether I think it's entertaining is irrelevant.
Why don't you talk to somebody around here who knows something about the law, preferably a man!
Brandenburgvs.Ohio,1969, itisnotillegal toadvocateviolence.
Thefirstamendment doesn't protect people who have knowledgeofan actualcrime!
What knowledge of a crime do I have?
Well, why don't you tell me, Randy?
What is this accident?
What is this FBI cover-up?
Why are you living at an unregistered address?
And why is that location lighting up a geiger counter?
You've been following me?
You've been casing my house?
Why don't you answer my questions?
Letmeshowyou something.

- Now, tom, look...
- Now, tom, look, what?
Really, what could you possibly have to say?
Because this is a fucking disaster!
I warned you, i tried to tell you.
- We still might have a weapons case!
- We ran those serial numbers.
Every single one of those guns is legally registered.
Every one!
Okay, so you think there's nothing to any of this?
Right?
The prepaid cellphones?
The barracks for 200 guys?
- The water system plans?
- They're conspiracy theorists!
It's all talk!
He keeps those plans around to trot out when he wants to act like a big shot!
What are they gonna do, they're gonna put radioactive material in the water supply?
That doesn't make any fucking sense!
You two, you pull this from here and that from there, and you're making up this whole big fucking story in your head, and it's bullshit!
You know, we see what we want to see!
Well, now you've compromised him, and you've compromised the bureau, and you've wasted all our fucking time!
This happens sometimes, you know?
- I mean, it sucks, but-- - "this happens"?
Is that all you're gonna fucking say after we find out all of this?
Everything you fucking put me through has been for nothing?
It's the nature of the work.
No!
This... this happened because of your pet theory!
And like an idiot, i went along with it!
"Oh, yeah, she's an expert," i thought.
"She knows what she's doing!"
I'm sorry, Nate.
Fucking why?
Why are you even sorry?
This has been great for you!
You got the thrill back!
You got the excitement you've been wanting, you got an escape from your little suburban life,
- by manipulating me!
- No, that is not fair!
I thought we had a case!
God, do you even know how many dead ends I've been down?
No, you fucking knew!
You knew I was so eager, so desperate to do something meaningful, to actually work on a real case in this place, that I would do anything you wanted, while you just sat back and enjoyed the ride!
Yeah.
Fuck!
Nate!
Hey, good to see you!
I've been calling you!
Yeah, I know, I'm sorry about that, I've been really busy.
I just wanted to return these.
I'm heading out of town for a couple of months, gonna work on setting up the business on the west coast.
Oh, wow, wow, well, please come in.
Uh, that's nice of you, but I don't think I can.
Aw, come on, just for a cup of tea?
Is everything okay, Nate?
Yeah, yeah, why do you ask?
Well, you said you're headed out west.
Yeah, I'm gonna work on setting up the business on the west coast.
Right.
God, it's hard to find what we're looking for in life.
But then, I listen to something like that.
One man made something...
That will make millions, maybe billions of people feel the way we just did.
We all have that power, Nate.
All of us.
Honestly...
I used to feel that way, Gerry.
I always felt like i could change the world.
You know, I could right wrongs, you know, fight injustice.
Nate, listen, it's guys like us that feel these things the most.
Idealists.
Yeah, I just keep thinking about that quote.
"For evil to triumph, it only takes good men to do nothing."
But how?
You know, fucking how?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Gerry, i shouldn't be...
- It's all right.
- I'm just really tired.
You know, Nate, maybe you're going about this the wrong way.
The rallies, the speeches, the politics...
That's not how the change is gonna come.
It's gonna come from the unknown soldiers, from the leaderless resistance.
How do you mean?
Let's go out back.
I made some improvements to the tree house.
Talking frankly is something we have to be very careful about.
- Something we always do outdoors.
- Right, of course.
You know, I've thinking about this for a long time, Nate, years really.
What's needed is an event.
What kind of event?
An event that wakes people up.
They're sleepwalkers out there.
They're blind.
Think about this regime.
Media brainwashing, secret courts, mass surveillance, waco, Ruby Ridge.
Using Katrina and 9/11 to set up "refugee camps," or "detention camps", in other words, concentration camps, because who cares about the rights of a few arabs, niggers and racists, if it makes us safer?
Right?
That's how it all starts.
All the lies that the zionists tell about Nazi Germany, that's what's actually happening right now!
The irony of it!
Right?
That's why we gotta be smart.
That's why the event has to force the zog to show its hand.
It's gotta reveal the men behind the curtain.
Because it's not the event that wakes people up, it's the reaction to the event.
Yes!
Yes, you get it!
Yeah, look at the sons of Liberty.
Look at the ira.
That is how you start a revolution.
Yeah, yeah, I always felt this kinship with you, Nate.
And...
I wanted to talk openly with you, but I just haven't known you that long, but I know in my heart, i can trust you.
You can.
You can, Gerry, i want to help.
I want to make a difference.
Okay.
I still got connections from my Africa days.
Okay, and we have the means to create that kind of event.
But, Nate, if you get involved we may not live to see the world we're building.
But I'll have helped to build it.
A man's body dies, but his deeds live forever.
There's a way you can help us.
- Okay, yeah.
- Come here.
We need to talk to the s.A.C., now!
Oh, my lord, who the hell wrapped it?
You guys aren't trying to give it a bath!
Oh, hey, guys!
Sorry abut that, just having some technical difficulties over here.
- No problem!
- Be right over...
- Okay, one, two...
- Hey, Morgan, David...
I want you to meet somebody.
This is Nate.
Morgan, good to meet you.
- Greetings, sir.
I'm David.
- Hey, you guys.
So is the wedding out here?
Yeah, it's right over here.
It's beautiful, isn't it?
Wait till we see it all lit up.
Pure of spirit and pure of race, these two souls commit themselves to the defense and prosperity of their sacred blood.
May their sons and daughters fill this land, forever honoring their duty to folk, kindred, soil, and honor.
Iknowyouguys don'tknowNatethatwell .
But he's a good man and he's a good soldier.
If you trust me, you can trust him.
No luck yet.
No one wants to sell to an anonymous buyer.
If we give up that prepaid phone crap, i use my real name,
I got three guys i can get it from right now.
If we do it the morning of-- yeah, I thought we were at least trying to do this without getting caught?
Guys, guys, shh.
Nate has a potential solution for us.
Tatp.
It's much better than ammonium nitrate anyway.
A smaller quantity will give you a much bigger blast.
Yeah, well, sure, but where are we gonna get that?
I run a medical supply company.
And you're gonna get tatp?
I know it's not the easiest thing, but I've got some connections.
I can make a few calls and loop back with Gerry.
Assuming I can, what are we gonna do about the cesium powder itself?
Ready when we need it.
No, I mean, how are we going to handle it?
Well we've got heavy gloves, and we've got goggles.
No... radioactive particles will pass through those as easy as anything else, including your skin.
- Well, what do you suggest?
- I think we need suits.
They'll be pretty bulky, but we only need to wear them when the powder's out in the open.
When do we need them by?
Well, we've just been waiting for the explosive.
If you can get the tatp, Sunday is our day.
You guys remember Timothy McVeigh's last words?
Yeah, he read invictus.
"It matters not how strait the gait, how charged with punishments the scroll,
I am the master of my fate:
I am the captain of my soul."
Are you sure this is gonna look right?
Wow.
It looks great.
The secret is the smell.
Where's the bleach powder?
Oh, it's right over here.
And you're sure they're not gonna try and test this somehow?
Yeah, that's why terrorists love tatp.
You can't identify it without a mass spectrometer.
Okay, if you say so.
Yeah.
Uh-huh, yeah, I'm here now.
Sunday, so team's in place Friday night.
Look, can I just say
I'm sorry about what i said to you the other day.
I was exhausted.
Don't worry about it.
That's what this job does to you.
Keep at it another ten years and you'll turn into a real asshole...
like me.
It's totally secure.
We can keep everything in here, and then, on game day, we can use this space to put it all together.
Great, great.
This is great, Nate.
And here is the tatp.
- No problems, inquiries?
- Nope.
All good.
Morgan's a pharmacist.
All right.
Hm, these crystals seem a little small.
Smells about right.
Okay, let's test it.
Test it?
You got a mass spectrometer in your bag?
No, we'll just see if it burns.
What?
No, whoa, whoa!
Hold on, what do you mean?
Burn it?
What are you talking about?
Well, we use a sample, we set it a light.
It burns for a while before it explodes.
I saw it on YouTube.
Are you insane?
Do you know how dangerous this stuff is?
Hey, you are not the only one with experience!
This is a highly unstable substance, okay?
It's sensitive to heat, friction-- which is why I'll do the test carefully!
Now you want to see the video?
Because I have it here on my phone!
I don't give a shit about what's on your phone!
We are not lighting this stuff on fire!
You know how many bomb techs i saw get their faces blown off trying to deal with this stuff in Iraq?
I've worked with this company for two years!
They are not gonna send me a container full of baking soda, okay?
Gerry, this doesn't work for me, okay, if he doesn't trust me, or my suppliers-- we need to test the fucking stuff!
You don't fucking trust me or my suppliers, that is your problem!
You want to use ammonium nitrate, fine with me!
- Okay.
- Fine with me.
Nate, Nate, Nate.
It's all right.
It's fine, it's fine.
Morgan, Morgan, he's right.
Come on.
He's right.
So, can we see the suits?
And it's kind of hard with the gloves, but... and you zip that up and fasten along there.
You guys, what would be worse, radiation poisoning or wearing this thing around for a couple hours?
Yeah.
Soifyoueverhave anydoubt white men created civilization, justgohavealook .
Howdoyoureason withsomeonelikethat?
Howcanyoueverhope tochangetheirmind?
Hello?
Hey, hey, listen, something's wrong.
David drove to Frederick county earlythismorning andwentto afarmsupply.
Itlookslikehebought ammoniumnitrate.
And now they're all at Gerry's.
But it's Saturday?
And why do they need ammonium nitrate?
I don't know.
Me and Hernandez are heading over to meet the surveillance team at Gerry's now.
- What are you going to do?
- I don't know!
No!
No!
You can not raid them yet!
You don't even know if they have the cesium?
And Gerry's phone's off.
Okay, I have to go over there.
No,Nate!
It--
- What are you doing here?
- I was calling, you didn't answer.
I got worried.
- Bullshit!
Why are you here?
- I just told you!
I'm gonna give you one more chance.
Okay, what the fuck is wrong with this guy?
I called three times, you didn't answer any of them!
I got worried something happened to you!
All right, put it down!
He's telling the truth!
- Were you followed?
-
- No, I wasn't!
- Are you sure?
- Yes!
I was worried, so I was checking constantly!
Okay, calm down, everybody calm down.
Okay, can somebody tell me what is going on?
I sent David to do surveillance on your shop last night.
I saw an electrical crew go into the building across the street.
- So?
- In the middle of the night?
Could there be like a power problem?
No, they must have traced the tatp you ordered.
- Okay, if they're on to the shop...
- Fuck.
...they're on to you.
Are you sure you weren't followed?
- Yes!
- If he said he wasn't, he wasn't!
Stay calm and keep your eyes open.
Morgan, get back to work, please, Jesus.
We had to move forward, immediately.
It would have been only a matter of time before they were on to us, too.
And you weren't gonna let me know?
Nate, I'm sorry.
It's too risky.
Well, he's here now, let's get him to help!
What about the tatp?
David got ammonium nitrate instead.
He used his name, so the jig is up.
They'll know it's us.
It's not gonna matter tomorrow.
We're in this to the end now, Nate.
Do you understand?
They're not gonna take us alive.
All right, let me help.
Okay, okay, good.
Come over here.
I should go wash up so I don't contaminate anything.
Oh...
Hey, Nate!
How are you?
- Nate!
- The cesium is here!
All right, everyone!
Let's get ready to do this!
No!
Angela, you have to tell him to wait.
Wait?
No, no, no, we need to get in there now!
There are three guys in there with machine guns and they're building a bomb.
This is a residential neighborhood.
His wife and kids are in the house.
Ifyoucomeinhere now, it'llbeabloodbath .
This is a volatile situation.
Yeah, which is why we need to move now...
No, he doesn't get it!
These guys are fanatics!
They will not be taken alive!
Tom, you're not in there!
We have to listen to him.
And what the fuck happens if the explosives go off whilewe'rewaitingaround?
Nate,yougot60seconds todisarmthoseguys, becausewe'recomingin.
Okay, let's get these suits ready.
Okay, let's get ready to move!
We are almost done here!
Fuck!
The cesium spilled!
Shit, get the suits on!
Go, go, go!
Come on!
Come on, help me!
Help me!
Get zipped up!
Get zipped up!
Son of a...
Shit, come on!
- Come on, get your hood on!
- No!
No!
...stop!
Get the gun!
It's me!
It's me!
It's me!
Are you okay?
You all right?
- You all right?
- Yeah, no, I'm good, I'm good.
I know my rights!
I'm a patriot of the United States!
- Shut your fucking mouth!
- Fuck you!
Come on, get up!
Surprise!
Thepaperworkcamein...
Houston.
Yeah...
Texas.
Can you believe it?
Good margaritas, I hear.
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm gonna miss it here, though.
Well, "it's" going to miss you, too.
"This should have been a noble creature;
he hath all the energy which would have made a goodly frame of glorious elements, had they been wisely mingled."
Gerry?
Yeah, Gerry, and all of them, really.
Yeah, that's why you were the right guy for the job.
What do you mean?
Why do you think I picked you?
I knew that you would understand them.
And they'd understand you.
And the more authentic you became with them, the more authentic they'd become with you.
Because when it comes down to it, there really is only one essential ingredient to fascism.
It'svictimhood.
I blamed those black kids, and I blamed this school,
I blamed the cops;
I blamed everybody.
I was gonna hurt everyone else the way they hurt me.
I look at you guys and I see myself.
But you guys don't have to make the same mistakes I did.
You don't have to be victims.
Hey.
- Hey.
- Hey.
That was great.
Thanks.
Dude, thanks...
Thanks for coming by.
I'm so proud of you, Johnny.
You know what they say...
It all begins with the word.
You have the phone?
Should I do it now?
Not yet.
Wait until we get to the checkpoint.
Okay, guys, this is it.
Hey, Ivy League's gun, put that gun back away.
- What are you talking about?
- I don't need some egghead who just scored an 81 on his 'qual shooting my dick off, okay?
This is my fucking guy!
I'm not just gonna sit here while you...
Guys, enough!
Nate, just follow our lead, okay?
Is your heart clear?
Are you sure you want to do this?
The signal will be better outside.
Here it is.
Did it work?
- Drop it!
- Freeze!
Hands in the air!
- Turn around!
- Hands behind your back!
You have the right to remain silent, Usman.
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
You have the right to an attorney.
Hello, Usman.
I can help you.
I can get you phone calls with your parents, your friends...
My parents?
I wish they were dead!
And I don't have any friends.
Oh, wow, he's a real prince, this one.
Can I get in there?
Salam alaikum.
What the fuck, Tom?
I have this room at 4:00!
I know you don't get a lot of news downstairs, Zamparo, but we just broke up a massive terrorist plot, all right?
Try and keep up.
What?
What is it?
Sir, when I flagged up this guy's email,
I thought the investigation was only gonna proceed if there was substantive criminal evidence to back it up.
We've got hours of him talking about waging jihad and killing children.
Right, but talking, though, sir, not...
he's not doing anything.
Isn't that the point?
Hey, Tim.
How's it going?
You celebrating something, Nate?
You seeing someone special, huh.
Uh, yeah, actually.
How'd you guess?
Genius, emergency meeting in the conference room!
The crash was off 301 around 2:00 last night.
Local police controlled the scene, so, thankfully, the press knows nothing.
These containers carried cesium-137.
It's used for radiotherapy applications in hospitals, but, it's highly regulated and had no business being on that truck.
When we tracked the shipment back to Baltimore, the customs record showed eight containers, not two.
So there's six more of them out there, all of them in the country illegally.
If that quantity made it's way into a radiological device, we could be looking at thousands of casualties, mass evacuations and radioactive contamination throughout the D.C. area.
Tom?
Uh...
lab analysis puts the cesium coming from North Africa.
So the guys on four, they put together this map.
It's an analysis of Muslim communities in D.C., Maryland and Virginia, along with their countries of origin.
What we'd like each and every... yes?
What about leads on the DT front?
Well, given the cesium came from North Africa, we don't think domestic is really in the picture.
The last time anyone tried to build a dirty bomb on US soil was James Cummings.
He was a white supremacist living in Maine, he was going to set it off at Obama's inauguration.
He had uranium, thorium, and he was trying to acquire cesium.
I'm sure you're familiar with the case.
It goes without saying, anyone here is welcome to pursue any leads they think are fruitful.
Okay, would you fucking stop...
- Oh, I'm so sorry.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- I'm Angela Zamparo.
- Nate Foster.
- I know.
You got a couple minutes?
DT's downstairs.
There's only one perk to being down in this shithole.
Nicorette just isn't the same.
So, Nate... you seem like you've got a bit more going on than most around here.
You remember Oklahoma City?
Well, yeah, I guess I was...
five but, sure.
What do you know about Timothy McVeigh?
He was... some kind of lone extremist...
in a militia?
Don't be an asshole who bullshits questions you don't know the answer to.
Here.
Timothy McVeigh was a decorated Gulf War veteran.
He was not insane.
He was not a lunatic.
And he was not stupid.
He was a white supremacist, following a plan.
What plan?
A plan from a book called The Turner Diaries.
It's about a "race war" to exterminate blacks, Jews, and "mud people."
You know how the war gets started?
The hero drives a truck bomb into a federal building.
Timothy McVeigh was reenacting that scene from The Turner Diaries.
He was carrying the book with him when he was arrested.
What he was trying to do was start the race war.
You're focused on the Islamic guys.
I get it.
We all create a narrative based on what we think is important.
We see what we want to see.
But just because you're not looking at something... doesn't mean it's not there.
So, why are you telling me this?
I'm talking about a blood and guts, in the streets, kill or be killed race war.
I have information about a truck accident outside D.C. last night, involving classified, radioactive material.
But now the FBI is trying to cover it all up.
Why?
Because something big is happening, and it's bigger than 9/11, and it's bigger than Oklahoma City.
So be warned, be armed, and be ready.
His name is Dallas Wolf.
He gets 20,000 listeners a night.
We believe he's based just outside of D.C., but almost nobody knows him personally.
But, I have an informant, a skinhead in a gang.
And the leader of that gang is friends with Wolf.
So, I need someone to get in there, and get close to him.
Right, and I'm trying to tell you that this is not my thing!
I barely passed the PFT!
What do you think undercover work is?
Beating guys up and shooting at them?
No, it's people skills.
It's controlling situations.
It's this.
Seriously?
This is the only undercover training you'll ever need.
I saw you with that Muslim kid.
You got most of this going on anyway.
Look, I read your file.
High IQ, great people skills, but, not your typical FBI profile.
Introverted, an outsider, unhappy childhood.
Single mother, always moving around a lot, always the new kid, bullied at school, no close friends or...
Okay, okay, okay, fuck you!
That's... this is an invasion.
What gives you the right to look around...
Because we don't have time to dick around here!
You don't smuggle a boatload of cesium into the country and then just let it fucking sit there!
Fine, but I'm trying to tell you, I don't have the skills for this!
I can't even defend myself!
You do have the skills, and they mean you will never have to!
What did you say to that kid?
"You want to change things, so nobody has to suffer the way you did."
A dirty bomb is any kind of crude, explosive device that, when detonated, disperses radiation around and beyond the blast.
What you would do is irradiate a large territory.
Some of these things have a half-life of 30 years.
In many cases, this material cannot be seen, it can not be smelled, cannot be felt, cannot be tasted.
The more technically capable an adversary is the more likely they would be to find ways to spread the radioactive material over larger areas.
One of things that we've been taught in recent years is that we must be able to prepare for the unthinkable.
A terrorist cell smuggling weapons of mass destruction into the country in a shipping container.
An American Hiroshima.
Are you out of your fucking mind?
Do you know how management looks at undercover, Nate?
You think this office is bad?
They'll have you chasing pedophiles on an Indian reservation.
I just want to discuss the option, sir.
Discuss the option?
Of what, of killing your whole career?
In the beginning was the word.
When the word found us we were unconscious.
But the word awakened us.
It made us conscious.
Our enemies were everywhere.
Our eyes were opened.
And they were filled with shame.
We have been violated, betrayed, and humiliated.
For we had allowed this to happen.
And so the word spoke to us, and told us to stand up!
To take back what had been stolen from us!
To ﬁght for race, soil, and honor!
Do you know what they do to informants, Nate?
You know what a "necktie" is?
They slit your throat, and they pull your tongue right out through it?
- Oh, shut the fuck up!
- Oh, what, so you want him to go in blind, so he has no idea what he's getting into?
- You're just trying to manipulate him!
- Oh, and you're not?
You do whatever the fuck you want.
But you better think long and hard about this.
The Turner Diaries, it's sold over a half a million copies.
Who do you think is buying it?
Eric Rudolph, the Olympic Bomber, Wade Page, who shot up the Sikh Temple.
Larry Ford, developing typhoid and cholera.
Liam Krar, with the Cyanide Bomb, anthrax, ricin, botulism, C-4,IED's,
I could go on like this for hours.
And all of them are white supremacists.
My name is Nate Thomas.
I was in the Marines for three years, on a WMD squad in Iraq.
But, I saw a lot of things over there that changed me.
- And I'm startin' to wonder...
- No.
My name is Nate Thomas.
I was in the Marines for three years, on a WMD squad in Iraq.
But, I saw a lot of things over there that changed me.
I started to wonder what was really going on in this country.
And now I'm back home... trying to make a new start.
I'm starting to figure out the truth about some things.
There's really only a handful of people who know what's going on.
But I want to be one of them.
And I want to make a difference.
Okay.
Not bad.
What else?
What's this?
It's my DD-214.
I was up all night Photoshop-ing it, so if anyone wants to see proof of my service in the Marines, they can just...
What the fuck are you doing?
No.
No, no, no.
Listen to me.
If you get yourself in a situation where you have to show somebody your DD-214, then you're already done.
You understand?
Good.
Now what else?
Lone extremism is not a social phenomena, it's a tactic.
Terrorists call it Leaderless Resistance.
The leaders of the movement provide inspiration, but they also encourage hidden cells act independently like, Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols.
Principle number 3:
Arouse in the other person an eager want.
So, what do they want from you?
My loyalty?
I'm loyal, I'm dedicated to the the cause.
No.
Any thug can be loyal.
What do you have...
What the guys with the cesium...
are gonna want?
Welcome to MedVale Medical Supply Company.
My military contacts helped me start this business.
Most of our sales are online.
Our radiotherapy products are specifically designed for the handling and storing of radioactive material.
So... we can acquire sensitive materials and hide them.
His name is Frank Hedges.
He's been a CI for two years.
He's in a gang called the Panzer Strike Force, and the leader of the gang is this guy.
Vince Sargent.
He's friends with Dallas Wolf.
So, Vince and Dallas Wolf are tight?
Yeah, I told you, Vince calls into Wolf's show every week.
So, Frank brings you into the gang, you hang out, get some credibility, you make these guys like you.
You get close to Vince.
Then, you use him to get to know Wolf.
This is my friend Nate I was telling you about.
Hey, everybody.
14/88, brother.
Good to meet you.
All right, spread 'em.
Roy does our security.
Okay, fine.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Hey, what the fuck is that?
- What's what?
- That!
Under your fucking shirt there!
What is that?
Hey, are you a cop?
Hey, look me in my fucking eyes, boy!
Are you a fucking cop?
- No, I'm not.
- No?
He's fine.
Sorry about that, Nate.
But you know how it is.
- Yeah, absolutely.
- Whoa, whoa.
Have a seat.
You drink Bud?
Uh, yeah, absolutely.
Frank tells me you were in Iraq.
Yeah, three years in the Corps.
- You kill anybody?
- Johnny!
He's Johnny.
He's a... he's a fresh cut.
We're trying to teach him the ropes.
I know the fuckin' ropes, man.
Yeah?
Then mind your fucking manners!
So, did you?
Kill anybody?
I don't talk about that.
What... what I did see was a lot of our guys go down.
Good guys... friends.
And for what?
I was on a WMD squad, the whole reason we were there, except we didn't find shit, did we?
So then I get home, I started listening to Dallas Wolf.
Oh, yeah?
Dallas and I go way back.
Oh, there's a guy I'd love to meet, you know.
He's somebody who's telling the truth.
He's out there, he's asking, why were we there?
And the answer's always the same.
Iraq, 9/11, Osama bin Laden, what does it all come back to?
Look at every war we've ever been in.
How many white men slaughtered their brothers in World War ll?
What, like a 100 million?
And for who?
Who's always pulling the strings?
It's all here in front of us.
But most people are blind.
Look at this bottle.
You see anything funny?
You're talking about the Jew tax?
What's the Jew tax?
Tell 'em, Nate.
Start looking at the food you buy, you'll see this little "U."
The Union of Orthodox Rabbis gets paid to perform a "blessing" on everything in the grocery store.
For this "blessing," they rake in billions of dollars in taxes.
We can't control the ketchup, but we can control the streets.
That's how it went down in Germany.
And we think of ourselves as a Sturmabteilung.
We are a thinking man's soldiers.
First here.
And then here.
And that is where the revolution starts.
We're not these tired old KKK guys, waiting for some catastrophe to start a race war.
- We're the catastrophe.
- That's fucking right.
And we need guys like you, with military backgrounds.
We need best practices in our security.
Come on, man, I think our fucking security is pretty good.
Well, always room to improve, though, right?
Oh, yeah?
Like what?
Well, like, look at the position of this booth and then tell me, without looking, where the nearest exits are.
- What's your point?
- The point is, of all the large booths in this restaurant, you picked the one farthest from the exits.
If something goes down, we're fucked.
No, we're ready for whatever goes down.
Yeah, with only you and him, I don't know your name yet, I'm sorry, carrying?
Oh, and how the fuck you think you know that?
When you pat someone down so they're facing everybody's lap, it's pretty easy to tell.
You spend three years in Iraq, you learn how to scan a room.
And see threats.
Well, isn't that fucking impressive.
Now I only got one question for you.
What?
Why are you wearing Levis?
Levis?
Your fucking Jew jeans?
Yeah, no, sorry, I just couldn't help notice when I was patting' you down.
While you were doing your little detective work all up in everybody's lap.
So, why are you wearing them?
Because when I got home from Iraq, my brother gave me these jeans...
as a homecoming gift.
Now, does he understand the struggle we're in?
No.
But I'm sure as shit not gonna let a Zionist conglomerate keep me from wearing them.
You wanna boycott the Jews?
You ever look at the Fortune 500?
You'll be living in a fucking cave.
He's right.
Shit...
they probably own this place, too.
Frank tells me you run a medical supply company now?
Yeah.
Yeah, my military contacts helped me set up.
We're just starting out, but we got access to a lot of stuff.
That's great.
I'd love to talk to you about that sometime.
Yeah... anytime.
You know, when I was... when I was 13, I actually, I played soccer.
One day, I came into the locker room, right?
And there were these six niggers, and they had this friend of mine, this Irish kid, down in the stalls, right?
His head was up against the toilet, and his face was just covered,
I mean, covered in blood, like flaps of skin.
I'd never seen anyone get beaten like that?
And when I came in, they just...
stared at me.
They stared, and I...
I walked away... and ju... just left him.
I hated those motherfuckers.
Yeah, when I was your age, I got pushed around a lot.
- Yeah?
- It fucking sucks.
But you can use that.
Yeah, but with these guys, nobody can do shit to me.
I learned to be proud.
Strong!
- Yeah, but...
- To be an Aryan fucking warrior!
- Isn't that right, Johnny?
All right, so what, are we gonna stand around all night
- or we gonna get fucking drunk!
- Let's go!
Come on, junior, let's get some fucking beer, motherfucker!
Come on, boy!
Get in there, boy!
Hey, Nate, you know what, man?
Everybody seems to really fucking like you.
Yeah.
This is my friend, Nate, I was telling you about.
Hey, everybody.
14/88, brother.
Good to meet you.
All right, spread 'em!
Roy does our security.
To be an Aryan fucking warrior!
Isn't that right, Johnny?
Something big is happening.
In the beginning was the word.
Be armed and be ready.
- Hey!
- Hey.
What's the matter, man?
You didn't hear me?
I just... uh...
You sleep well?
What's wrong?
Oh, yeah, no, we know where you live.
- Yup.
- Right.
Cool.
Yeah, so, what, you're not gonna invite us in?
Yeah, come on in.
Oh, thanks, man, so sweet of you.
It's a... mess, sorry.
Welcome.
You mind?
Yeah, it's a cool place, man.
Yeah, but it...
kind of looks like you just moved in.
So, what are you guys doing here?
Aw...
Don't break my heart.
What are we doing here?
Come on, don't make it sound like you're not happy to see me.
See Vince is outside.
He's got a little surprise for you.
Oh, hey, well um...
Yeah, well, I'm ready.
Let's go.
You're gonna be psyched, man!
It's fucking awesome!
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Cool, well, I'm good to go.
Let's head out.
- Let's go, Roy.
- What's the rush?
I'm coming.
What the fuck?
What the fuck is that?
Goddamn, man, you got some fucking shitty-ass furniture up in here, huh?
Yep.
Cheap as shit.
- All right, you ready?
- Yeah, I'm ready.
- Sieg Heil, motherfucker, let's go.
- Sieg fucking Heil.
You didn't finish your transcript.
Yeah, I know, I'll get to it.
Look at my fucking arm!
And what the fuck is going on with this guy Roy?
You make him look small, you make him into an enemy.
Sometimes, Angela, it would just be great to hear, "Good job."
I'm only so hard on you because I'm trying to protect you.
You have to remember your objective here.
This is about getting to Dallas Wolf.
So what do I do about that?
Try relating to these guys as human beings.
You know?
Open up to them, if you can.
You may have more in common with them than you think.
Man, why the fuck does Vince make us come to this shit?
"Good networking, lots of movement guys." I mean, who gives a fuck?
Well, is Dallas Wolf gonna be here?
Who the fuck knows?
I don't listen to that talk radio bullshit.
Fuck!
Goddamn.
Hey, that looks good on you, man.
Yeah, thanks.
Just go in, I got another shirt in the cargo.
Hi, you must be Vince's friend, Nate!
- I'm Becky, Gerry's wife.
- Oh, hi, nice to meet you.
- Such a pleasure to have you.
- Thank you for having me.
Yeah, of course.
Hey, Nate, I made some cupcakes.
The frosting is a little messed up, but they taste good.
So, Dallas, we wanted...
Nate!
Come check this out.
Is it true, this Dallas Wolf Unity Rally is the largest event you've hosted in years?
Absolutely.
We've brought together the biggest white separatist organizations in the Northeast.
And we're also having a conference, with some of the world's preeminent racial scholars.
But let me get something straight.
You have all your permits, you have all your licenses, and yet this AFL, the Anti-Fascist League,
John, can we get the graphic?
They're planning on viciously attacking peaceful demonstrators with hockey sticks and D batteries and urine balloons.
Not only that.
They're busing in hundreds of protestors from the D.C. area.
But all I can say is, the AFL better be careful.
Because while we come in peace, we're certainly not afraid of war.
Fuck.
Yeah.
God, that's the first I'm hearing about this rally.
I mean, God knows you can't get any real news on the Yidivision, but still...
Are you planning on going, Nathan?
And this is Andrew Blackwell from the Aryan Alliance.
- Hail Victory, brother.
- Hail Victory.
The Aryan Alliance, huh?
I've read a lot about you guys.
Well, we're the premiere white nationalist group in the world, so, that's not surprising.
Earnest Walton, Grand Dragon, good to meet you.
Good to meet you.
Earnest is with the local Klan.
Yeah, you should stop by one of our meetings.
- We'd love to have you.
- Oh, wow.
You should check out our website, too.
We're always looking for quality people.
I don't think Nate's into all that religious stuff.
Excuse me?
Religious stuff?
I just think Nate is a little more rational than that.
I'm not sure I know what you mean by that.
Come on, Nate.
Let's go back and get some food.
Stay away from those faggots.
They got this fucked up religion where they think the Bible was written for white men and Aryans are the lost tribes of Israel.
The Bible.
Jews invented Christianity.
Jews invented the printing press, and the Bible is the most published book in the world.
I mean, anything seem off to you?
How about the fact the Romans conquered every mud race on earth, and then Christianity finished them off in a hundred years?
You gotta know who to stick with in this movement.
You're with us.
Goddamn it, Vince, every time we come here, the whole fuckin' place is dry!
- What the fuck, man?
- It's two hours, be good.
Gerry, there's somebody I want you to meet.
This is Nate.
- Hey, Gerry Conway.
- Nate Thomas, nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.
Vince told me all about you.
Make yourself at home.
I am throwing on some veggie burgers.
Thanks for having us.
- Hi!
- Hey, hey, I'm Nate.
- Madeline.
Nice to meet you.
- Hey, Madeline.
- This is Timmy.
- Hey, Timmy.
You want to come see our tree house?
Yeah, sure, where are we going?
Oh, right, yeah, there.
Oh, wow, that is great!
Did your Dad build this?
- I built it!
- You built this?
- But my Daddy helped.
- Okay.
Wow.
- It's to protect us.
- Yeah, from what?
If the mud people come.
Always be ready.
Always be watchful and stick together.
You guys kidnapping my guest?
Huh?
Huh?
This is amazing, man.
Well, I've always been good with my hands.
And it was just wonderful to have a project with the kids.
You know how you spell love, Nate?
T-I-M-E.
Ninety percent of the time you'll ever spend with your kids
- comes before the age of 12.
- Wow.
Yeah.
You been in the movement long, Nate?
Not long.
Just since I got back from Iraq.
Oh, yeah, right.
Yeah, Vince told me you served.
Hey, Nate, don't take this the wrong way but you kind of seem a little mature for a skinhead.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Yeah, maybe.
I don't know.
What about you?
You seem to know a lot of people in this movement.
They probably come for the free food.
You have these barbecues often?
Yeah, as much as I can, yes, you know,
I try to create a positive environment for everybody in the community, and a place for us to come together and be healthy in body and spirit.
"Fuck you, bitch!" And he turned around, and he's like...
Guys!
Guys!
Language, please.
Kids.
Jesus fucking Christ.
It makes me so sad to see those two.
They gotta clean up their act.
Well, how do you mean?
Well, the cigarettes, and alcohol, the language.
And this is what's happening to our young Aryan men.
Yeah.
To be honest, now that I met you,
I'm kind of surprised you invited those guys.
Well, you can't exclude them.
I mean, they're the next generation.
They need our help.
Need to understand their heritage, and be proud of it.
That's what it's all about, isn't it?
The children.
What kind of a world will they grow up in?
Goddamn, man, that was the worst fucking party on earth.
Jesus Christ, what kind of bullshit vodka is this, man?
Man, that's the last time I ever let you pick it out.
Man, look at that shit.
Look at that!
That is just fucking...
God, that is so fucking awful!
Man, look at that, look at that beautiful, Aryan woman and that fucking...
Roy, come on, let's go the fuck home.
No.
No, man, we're gonna teach these two a lesson.
- No!
- Get your fucking hands off of me!
Don't you ever fucking touch me again.
You hear me?
We're Aryan warriors, right?
That means we got a responsibility to do something about shit like this.
Hey, you two!
You need to get the fuck out of here!
Hold on, what did you say?
I said, get the fuck out of here or we're gonna kill you, you fucking spic!
- What the fuck is your problem?
- What's our problem?
You come into our country, you fuck our women.
Yeah, you got some big fucking balls, huh?
Put the fucking knife down and calm down, all right, man?
- They get the point.
- You thought you were a big man, huh?
He gets it, Roy!
He's fucking shaking.
I thought you were a big man!
- Put the fucking knife down!
- Fuck you, motherfucker!
I'll fucking gut you, you piece of shit!
Now go, fucker!
- Come on, let's go!
- Shit!
Fuck, Nate.
Goddamn it!
You're fucking lucky!
What the fuck is your problem?
You fucked the whole thing up!
Yeah, I think they got the message, Roy!
Got the message?
Are you a fucking idiot?
Man, those two were mine!
And then your dumb fucking ass decides...
Hang on, wait a minute...
first you tried to stop me, then you try to scare them off, and then you set off that fucking alarm.
That wasn't an accident, was it?
Was it, Nate?
You wanted them to get away.
What the fuck, Nate?
Huh?
I said what the fuck?
Okay, you're goddamn right I wanted them to get away!
You want to be a soldier, Roy and not a fucking thug?
Then think!
You think about security cameras, Roy?
You think about the liquor store we were just in?
You think about the clerk or the license plates on my fucking truck?
You think about any of that shit?
Fucking Aryan warrior...
A hundred spics and niggers ain't worth the life of one white man, but go ahead, put us all in prison.
That's how you're gonna win your race war?
Huh?
Fuck!
All right, whatever, can we just get back on the road and get the fuck out of here?
Fuck!
I ran those license plates.
An accountant, a school teacher, a lawyer, fireman, he's an engineer, not a criminal record in sight, but Andrew Blackwell, he's a different story.
Why is he here?
He said he was going to Wolf's rally.
He's the National Director of the Aryan Alliance.
They're based in Ohio, he wouldn't just come all this way to be in a rally.
Wait, if Wolf is involved in this, he can't be doing it alone, right?
I mean, he'd need help, and organization.
Exactly, so you need to figure out how Wolf and Blackwell are connected, and why he's really here.
- Vince, good to see you.
- Welcome brother.
Rich, can we get some literature, please?
- White power.
- White power.
Okay, we're gettin' ready to get started here.
Can everyone take a seat?
Most times I talk to you,
I focus on our survival, the terrible struggle to save our people before they are lost forever.
But what about the future?
What do we dream of?
What is the world we wish to build?
I'll tell you.
It will be a world like the one that shaped our race in Europe.
A world of forests, mountains, and lakes.
Not a world of concrete, asphalt, and garbage.
And instead of 300 million race-less mulattos, breeding and infesting.
Imagine a continent of 50 million white Europeans.
Smarter, stronger, healthier, noble men and women, living and working together in harmony and unity.
That's the world I see.
That's what keeps me strong.
That's the nation we can build...
together.
If you take millions of white people, and flood every country in Africa with them, what do they call that?
Genocide.
But what's happening to every white country on earth?
You've got affirmative action, that kills white jobs.
Abortion, that kills white babies.
Gay rights, that kill white families.
Folks, let me explain something to you.
"Diversity" is a code word.
And what it means is white genocide!
So, we'll begin marching at the courthouse.
And after two blocks...
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
This is not the order that we agreed to.
Aryan Alliance is supposed to be heading this march.
Just a second, Andrew.
You know, we're at this rally every year, and we start with the Colonial Patriots.
Well, this isn't "every year," is it?
To be fair, Harris, maybe we should.
You're a local organization...
Vince?
Can you introduce me to Dallas?
"The Klan"?
You guys aren't "The Klan."
Yeah, sure.
Come on, let's go.
You're the "Invisible White Knights" of the Ku Klux Klan!
Which is what, the third Klan group in the D.C. metro area?
Hey, Dallas!
Good to see you.
It's... it's Vince, Vince Sargent?
Right, Vince.
Good to see you.
Good to see you.
I want to introduce you to my good friend, this is Nate Thomas.
- I'm a huge fan of your show.
- Thank you, sir.
If you'll excuse me, I have to get ready for the march.
- Uh, Mr. Wolf?
- Yes, what is it?
I didn't want to get into this in front of Vince, but I'd like to talk to you about an investment.
- An "investment"?
- Mm-hm.
I represent a few people who are big fans of yours, and they want to help.
- Is that so?
- Yes, sir.
They have a number of assets in the online media space, and they feel the potential for your show is being limited by your advertising budget.
They want to help you penetrate some new markets, and they see no reason why you can't go nationwide.
Well, that is great, son.
That is just great.
Here, call this number and we'll talk.
Okay, great.
That sounds great, Mr. Wolf.
- Call me, Dallas.
- Thank you.
Racist scum!
Racist bum!
Racist scum...
We're here today because we're proud of our race!
We love our race!
And we're here to say that.
- White power!
- White power!
The white race is under attack in this country.
- White rights!
- White rights!
But nobody seems to give a damn!
- White freedom!
- White freedom!
- Where's Al Sharpton?
- Fuckin' rednecks!
Where's Jesse Jackson to fight for white rights!
- White power!
- White power!
White equality!
- White pride!
- White pride!
If you're white, and you are standing over there...
- White freedom!
- White freedom!
You're on the wrong side of that barricade!
- White rights!
- White rights!
Nate!
Wake up, white people!
Wake up!
- White power!
- White power!
It's morning in America and there's a new day coming.
- Nate!
What are you doing, man?
- Shut the fuck up, nigger!
Come join your race!
That's some fucker that works in my building.
Come join the white race!
White race!
- White power!
- White power!
Racist bum!
Racist scum!
Racist bum!
It's the fucking AFL.
Yeah, don't worry, they won't do shit.
Well, well, well, if it isn't the American Fucking Losers!
Yeah, fuck you!
Why don't you come over the fucking barricade, motherfuckers!
Johnny!
Hey, man, just fucking stay back, okay?
- Don't fucking do it.
- I gotta help him.
Help him by not getting the fuck arrested, okay?
- Fucking pussies!
- White Nazi scum!
Yeah, you know what?
I can do that shit, too.
I'm gonna fucking kill you, motherfucker!
- Do not engage.
Do not engage.
- You think I'm playing around?
I'm gonna fucking kill you!
Get your hands off of me!
I'm gonna kill these motherfuckers!
Stay back!
- White power!
- White power!
- White pride!
- White pride!
...you fucking motherfucker.
I'm gonna fucking kill you!
He hit me in the fucking eye!
...it's fucking piss!
Johnny!
Andrew!
Can you walk?
Get the fuck outta here.
You okay?
Everyone okay?
- Sorry.
Okay.
- Stay with us.
I'm getting you out of here, man.
- Go... go right, go right!
- Mm-hm.
Oh, fuck!
- Fuck!
- Fucking...
Holy shit!
Fucking go!
Fuck!
We gotta go!
We gotta fucking go!
I can't fucking go anywhere!
Stay down!
Fuck!
No, don't get up.
You need to rest.
I brought you some chamomile tea.
It'll help you relax.
Thank you.
There's our wounded warrior.
How you feeling, buddy?
Yeah, much better.
Thank you, guys.
No problem.
Let me put some music on.
I brought you Sammy to keep you company.
Thanks.
Oh, wow.
You like it?
I...
I love Brahms.
See, Becky, I knew he was quality.
I think the fourth is my favorite.
Yeah, mine, too.
Except maybe the...
- The first?
- Yeah.
Now listen, if you like Brahms,
I've got this Clarinet Quintet that will blow your mind.
They're dead, Gerry.
Dead.
I'm gonna find them, and we're gonna string them up...
Okay, guy, I hear ya, I hear ya.
That's... that's why I avoid the political stuff.
Not my thing.
Besides, I've heard it can be dangerous.
That was fantastic.
Thank you...
I thought you guys were vegetarians.
Everybody's gotta have a few vices every now and then.
What's "vices"?
Oh, boy, there we go!
I'm sorry about that, that's my ride.
Gerry, Becky, thanks for everything.
Nathan, I don't know what to say.
I owe you, big time.
Why don't you stop by the compound some time.
Oh, I'm not really in Ohio that much, but I'd love to if I ever am.
No, I meant the... the new one.
- Oh.
- Here in Virginia.
Oh, right, yeah, please, I'd love to.
- Bye.
- Have a good night.
Bye, Andrew!
Well, listen, you're not going to believe it, but when it comes to Tchaikovsky...
gotta go with Bernstein.
- Leonard Bernstein?
- I know, I know.
Gerry, I hate to break it to you, man...
I know.
Listen, I can't help it, he's a great conductor.
Jews listen to Wagner, don't they?
So, Gerry, if you don't mind my asking, how did you end up in the movement?
Listen, for me, it was the books.
My parents were practically liberals.
Totally blinded by the ZOG.
You know, I always knew something...
was wrong.
And...
I had this anger,
I couldn't put my finger on it, until... here.
It all started with this.
I was 13.
Read it in four days.
It explains race, culture, capitalism... how democracy destroyed Western civilization.
Democracy:
"Three people form a government.
Then two of them vote to steal the wealth of the third."
- David Lane, right?
- Mm-hm.
Now here's something more recent.
You'll love this.
This breaks down the entire worldwide Zionist conspiracy,
- step by step.
You can bring it back.
- Oh, no, I couldn't.
Nate, Nate, please.
But that was it?
I mean, it was just books woke you up?
Well, you know, I had my theories.
And then a three-month engineering contract opened up in Kenya.
I was young, I wanted to see the world.
And...
Nate, listen,
I got no problem with them having their own country, everybody should.
But if you go there, and you see, they...
they weren't even living like animals.
You know, animals don't live in their own feces, do they?
So, if you ever have any doubt white men created civilization, just go have a look.
Hey.
So, how was the Brahms?
How do you reason with someone like that?
How can you ever hope to change their mid?
Listen, you need to remember why you're doing this.
We're not social workers...
You wanted me to relate to them as human beings, right?
"Open up to them?" you said.
...they weren't even living like animals.
You wanna get a drink?
Where are we gonna go and get a drink?
This suspect, he was a fucking nightmare.
He was grabbing my ass, the whole thing.
And he kept insisting I go to this club with him, where I knew he was gonna make his big move, but, if I didn't go, then, you know, I could blow my whole cover.
So, what did you do?
So, we're at a bar, and I tell him I want oysters.
So, I get a dozen, I start plowing through them.
Then I start acting queasy.
I run to the bathroom, stick my finger down my throat.
- No way!
- Yeah!
So now there's puke all over my dress,
I tell him I got sick off the oysters and take a cab home.
Two days later, he was arrested.
- That is fucking awesome.
- Oh, it was fucked up.
But there was the thrill, you know?
That high?
God, there's nothing like it.
Yeah, so why'd you stop?
It was just... it's no way to live, the paranoia, the tension.
And I wanted to spend more time with my kids.
You got kids?
You don't think I'm mommy material?
No, no... no.
Yeah, I got two princesses.
Mommy and Daddy.
Perfect, little suburban life.
Anyway, I know how lonely this work can be.
But the case won't go forever.
You can't change the way people think, but you are making a difference.
Nathan, good to see you.
Can we get you anything, coffee?
Oh, no, I'm good, thanks.
- This is a great set-up you got here.
- Yeah, thanks.
All right, let's give you the tour.
This parcel is actually pretty small, but we're purchasing the one next to it.
Although, citizen's groups are trying to block us out.
Oh, yeah.
How are you handling that?
Well, we tell them we're here to stay.
Make no mistake about it.
We show up at their homes, their businesses, their churches.
They backed down pretty quick after that.
So you're moving the national headquarters?
No, we're keeping the compound in Ohio, it's just with...
everything going on right now, we needed a stronger presence here.
You know?
- Is that your firing range?
- Yeah, come on.
It's a little primitive, but we're working on it.
I'm no marksman, by any means, but I have some expertise in range design, just from training the Iraqi police.
What's your danger area template?
To contain your cone of fire.
I mean, how do you control your overshoot?
We haven't gotten to that yet.
Okay, well, you might want to make sure it's the kikes and niggers getting hit and not your guys.
Absolutely.
Maybe if you have time,
- you could talk to the guys about it.
- Yeah, sure,
I need to see what kind of equipment you've got, but I'm happy to.
Okay... come on up here.
Right now were just using this for storage.
- Are those cots?
- Yup.
We'll be able to sleep 200 in there.
And we're gonna need to.
I'm not gonna beat around the bush.
You see the type of organization we have here, but we could always use a man like you, Nathan.
Educated, war veteran, clean record.
I mean, hell, you don't even have any parking tickets.
Yeah, we have our contacts in law enforcement, local, state, federal, not to mention military hospitals, laboratories, you name it.
And so what's the overall objective here?
I mean, are you just trying to get the message out, or what?
Get the... get the message out?
To who?
We're not trying to recruit the public here.
What would we do with them?
They're at home sitting on their asses, watching sitcoms and surfing Facebook.
This is revolutionary activity we're talking about here.
Look, I'm flattered by the interest, but... you know,
I've been the movement awhile now, and a lot of these guys are all talk.
Now for me to really want to get involved,
I need to know there's bigger things going on here.
No offense.
Yeah... none taken.
All right...
Take a look at this.
This is the entire D.C. water system.
Plants, pipelines, the whole deal.
Now, Nathan, the guys you're hanging out with, they're all talk, because they're punks.
They're amateurs.
They sit around drinking beer all day, maybe they beat up a few niggers or each other.
We got no use for 'em.
We need men like you.
Can I help you?
I'm looking for Dallas Wolf, but I must have the wrong house.
Oh, no, he's here.
Come in.
Randy!
Someone's here!
Hey, Nate.
The studio's back here.
I'm moving studios right now, so, this is all temporary.
Oh, no, this is a great setup.
Thanks for taking the time to see me, Dallas.
I just spent the afternoon with Andrew at the Aryan Alliance.
Oh, yeah?
Andrew's great.
They have an incredible organization.
Yeah, they seem really serious about the struggle.
About doing whatever it takes.
They're true patriots, those guys.
Well, let me give you a bit of background on me.
I was in Iraq for three years, on a WMD squad.
And then when I got back, my military contacts helped me set up a medical supply company.
V-A-L-E.
Wow, this is great.
Yeah, we do it all, from bandages and syringes to x-ray and radiotherapy equipment.
And with the highly regulated stuff, we can cut through a lot of the red tape and deal directly, and discreetly.
Fantastic, Nate.
Great to know.
So... you'd also mentioned an investment?
For the show?
Yes, I've got an investor lined up who's very excited about expanding your reach.
We're talking advertising, marketing, bigger servers...
That's exactly what I need.
So how do I meet him?
Well, a lot of my military contacts don't like to publicize their efforts.
But he'd love for you to put together a proposal about how you'd expand the show.
Funny you should mention that.
I've been trying to raise $7,500 to break into the Florida market.
They're ripe right now, with all the immigration stuff.
Yeah...
Yeah, this is great!
So, there's one more thing.
Go ahead, shoot.
The reason he's helping you is because he feels that you are a man of action.
As he is.
As I am.
Right, sure.
So for him to move forward, he needs to know you're serious about this.
Nate, I've been ready to give my life for this cause for 20 years now.
What I need is the right people behind me.
So you tell your investor, that if he wants action, he's got the right guy.
Sorry, Dallas, I've got kind of a long drive back, you mind if I hit the head?
The whole case is about to blow wide open!
He's in with Wolf, he's in with the Aryan Alliance.
Yeah, and all we need to keep Wolf on the line is that $7,500!
Let me get this straight.
So after everything we spent on your cover, even after the medical supply business, you want me to ask for $7,500 as an "investment" in this guy's radio show?
You're the only one with a budget right now!
Oh, yeah, I'm just flush with cash!
I'm trying to run a 40-man investigation on top of all the shit I've already got!
Sir, the Alliance is building a compound outside D.C..
Wolf's house is setting off a Geiger counter!
I spent six hours last night reading your transcripts,
Nate, you don't have shit!
You don't have shit!
Look at how much carbon is built up on this bolt.
- See?
See that?
Like...
- Yeah.
That's unacceptable.
When's the last time you cleaned this?
I've been meaning to get to most of them.
Okay, guys, seriously!
Okay, so we got an AR-15, serial number A00724, needs a new buffer spring.
Come on, guys, let's go!
We need to go through the whole inventory.
Andrew's waiting on this.
I'm gonna have to tell Andrew, the only way it's gonna change is with new policies.
And how do I know it's not me you're trying to fuck?
Fuck you, you calling us liars?
You get on the phone yourself!
Call them up and ask them...
Hey, guys...
Hey, Nate... it's been a while.
Yeah, you kinda disappeared on us.
I'm sorry about that, Vince.
Been kind of busy.
Yeah, I bet you have.
Seems like you made a bunch of new friends around here, huh?
See, we were just wondering if maybe you could explain...
Roy!
Thanks for stopping by.
Be seeing you, Nate.
What was all that about?
Roy says the police have been following him.
He's paranoid about infiltrators.
Infiltrators, huh?
Yeah.
That's why the police are on his ass?
Have you seen how that guy behaves?
It's a miracle he's not in jail already.
Right.
You want to help us with something?
Sure, what's up?
I'm throwing a youth event for Hitler's birthday.
There's a campground a couple miles from here.
- Help us scout it.
- Sounds good.
It's amazing how much land there is right outside D.C.
Let me ask you something, Nathan.
What's your opinion on infiltration?
Well, how do you mean?
How do we prevent it?
Well, it's tough.
For one thing, you gotta keep guys with rap sheets out of important positions.
That's...
That's how they flip most people.
We have a polygraph back at the compound.
Maybe we should make everybody take it.
I mean, I think someone who's trained can beat a polygraph without blinking.
Yeah, maybe we should just do background checks for everybody.
Get everyone's records and documents together?
Yeah, I mean, for informants, that might work.
But for law enforcement, they just forge whatever they need.
Yeah, but with a few phone calls, you know, a cover only runs so deep.
Do you suspect someone?
It's like they say at these rallies.
You look to the left, look to the right, ya' know, one of these people is a snitch.
It's the left.
Turn left right up here.
You okay there, Nate?
You look a little off?
No, I'm good.
Just... tired... been a long day.
Well, I think this is a great location.
What do you think?
Yeah, I like it.
Well, what about the permits, though?
Tell them we're a Christian organization, holding a youth event.
I gotta ask you something.
Roy said he contacted the NPRC.
Said there's no record of you having served in the Marines.
You mean Roy went and filed a 180 with a government that he fucking hates, just to... okay.
I was on a WMD squad, so that's black ops.
And he knows that.
Fucker.
Wait, hold on, are you guys taking this seriously?
Is that what that was all about in the truck?
Because, I understand you have to do your due diligence or whatever, but that's a fucking serious accusation!
I don't need to take that shit from anybody!
- Hey.
Hey.
Hey, hey, hey!
- Least of all from-
Okay.
Let's get out of here.
Nate, listen.
We need to get the serial numbers first, and then...
No, look, I don't have time for that!
What if he wasn't convinced?
What if he calls Wolf?
The account name is Nate Foster, please.
You don't know if he was convinced!
You don't even know if they talk, okay?
You're being...
Yeah, I'd like $7,500 in cash.
You're a man of your word, which is a rare thing in this movement.
So, listen, Dallas, my investor is very excited, but he wants to know some more about what you're planning, some details.
Oh, okay, I think it was all in the presentation, but, we start with online in Tampa, and then we move down the...
- No, no, I mean, beyond that.
- Beyond Florida?
Beyond the show, like what we talked about.
The actions we're gonna take.
I'm sorry, Nate.
I lost you.
What do you mean?
What I mean is, you have been talking a lot about a lot of big things that are coming.
Bigger than Oklahoma City, bigger than 9/11...
Oh, yeah, for sure.
Which is why expanding the show is so important.
Right, and I have been spending a lot of time with Andrew at the Aryan Alliance.
He told me you'd been working together.
Well, yeah, sure, I mean, he came to the rally.
No, no, what my investor needs to know is what are the concrete steps that you are taking to start the race war.
As I said to you before,
I have the expertise, the connections, the tools.
Maybe there's some kind of misunderstanding.
I thought we were talking about expanding the show.
Yeah, which my investor is happy to do, but if you're not willing to be honest about the other actions you're taking, then he's not gonna be able to support you.
Okay, Nate, fair enough.
Sorry it didn't work out.
I saw the plans, Dallas, for the water system.
Andrew showed them to me, okay?
So, I know all about it, and now I just need you to stop pretending, and be honest with me.
This is private property.
You're no longer welcome here.
I'm asking you to leave.
Come on, Dallas.
I'm on your side.
Get the fuck out.
Now.
Fuck.
We're going to the office, Dallas Wolf is there.
- You brought him in?
- No.
He came to us.
Sir.
I didn't know you'd be here.
Has anyone talked to him?
No, no, of course not.
No, it's your show.
So, Dallas.
Or should I call you Randy?
That is your real name.
You can call me whatever you like, Agent Zamparo.
Any reason you're using an assumed name?
I'm a public entertainer.
Fine.
So, tell me why you're here today.
I'm here because of the guy I called about.
He shows up at my conference, talking about investing in my show.
But then, he's telling me how he can get highly regulated items.
And talking about plans to the water system, and threatening me!
His name is Nate Thomas, and if he does anything crazy,
I don't want to be associated with it.
Did he give you money?
- He tried to.
- How much?
- $7,500.
- Wow.
That's a lot.
- Why would he do that?
- Because he's a wacko!
A lot of these nutjobs approach me.
But this guy is on another level.
You have no idea why you, of all people, would be approached by this guy?
No, Agent Zamparo, I don't.
Right.
Let me play you something, okay, Randy?
I have information about a truck accident
outside D.C. last night, involving classified radioactive material, but now, the FBI is trying to cover it all up.
Why?
You've gotta be kidding me.
It's a radio show.
It's entertainment!
So you think it's entertaining to predict and incite terrorist attacks?
Whether I think it's entertaining is irrelevant.
Why don't you talk to somebody around here who knows something about the law, preferably a man!
Brandenburg vs. Ohio, 1969, it is not illegal to advocate violence.
The First Amendment doesn't protect people who have knowledge of an actual crime!
What knowledge of a crime do I have?
Well, why don't you tell me, Randy?
What is this accident?
What is this FBI cover-up?
Why are you living at an unregistered address?
And why is that location lighting up a Geiger counter?
You've been following me?
You've been casing my house?
Why don't you answer my questions?
Let me show you something.
Do you mind?
Help yourself.
From the White Action Network blog, AryanMother88 writes,
"I was driving down 301 last night, and the FBI had cordoned off an accident with hazmat tape.
I haven't seen anything on the news.
So what is the ZOG covering up?"
As for the unregistered address, I live with my mom, and I'd like to keep that private, if it's okay with you?
And your Geiger counter is lighting up because I have prostate cancer!
I know your type.
You think you've got it all figured out, and you don't know shit.
I'm an entertainer.
I do this for money, and for fun.
And I don't give a fuck about ZOG, or the race war or any of that shit.
I tell these jackasses what they want to hear, and they worship me for it.
So fuck you, Agent Zamparo.
Can you open the door, please?
- Now, Tom, look...
- "Now, Tom," what, "look", what?
Really, what could you possibly have to say?
Because this is a fucking disaster!
I warned you, I tried to tell you.
- We still might have a weapons case!
- We ran those serial numbers.
Every single one of those guns is legally registered.
Every one!
Okay, so you think there's nothing to any of this?
Right?
The prepaid cellphones?
The barracks for 200 guys?
- The water system plans?
- They're conspiracy theorists!
It's all talk!
He keeps those plans around to trot out when he wants to act like a big shot!
What are they gonna do, they're gonna put radioactive material in the water supply?
That doesn't make any fucking sense!
You two, you pull this from here, and that from there, and you're making up this whole big fucking story in your head, and it's bullshit!
You know, we see what we want to see!
Well, now you've compromised him, and you've compromised the Bureau, and you've wasted all our fucking time!
This happens sometimes, you know?
- I mean, it sucks, but...
- "This happens"?
Is that all you're gonna fucking say after we find out all of this?
Everything you fucking put me through has been for nothing?
It's the nature of the work.
No!
This... this happened because of your pet theory!
And like an idiot, I went along with it!
"Oh, yeah, she's an expert," I thought.
"She knows what she's doing!"
I'm sorry, Nate.
Fucking why?
Why are you even sorry?
This has been great for you!
You got the thrill back!
You got the excitement you've been wanting, you got an escape from your little suburban life,
- by manipulating me!
- No, that is not fair!
I thought we had a case!
God, do you even know how many dead ends I've been down?
No, you fucking knew!
You knew I was so eager, so desperate to do something meaningful, to actually work on a real case in this place, that I would do anything you wanted, while you just sat back and enjoyed the ride!
Yeah.
Fuck!
Nate!
Hey, good to see you!
I've been calling you!
Yeah, I know, I'm sorry about that, I've been really busy.
Um...
I just wanted to return these.
I'm heading out of town for a couple of months, gonna work on setting up the business on the West Coast.
Oh, wow, wow, well, please come in.
That's nice of you, but I don't think I can.
Come on, just for a cup of tea?
Is everything okay, Nate?
Yeah, yeah, why do you ask?
Well, you said you're... headed out west.
Yeah, I'm gonna work on setting up the business on the West Coast.
Right.
God, it's hard to find what we're looking for in life.
But then, I listen to something like that.
One man made something...
that will make millions, maybe billions of people feel the way we just did.
We all have that power, Nate.
All of us.
Honestly, I used to feel that way, Gerry.
I always felt like I could change the world.
You know, I could... right wrongs, you know, fight injustice.
Nate, listen, it's guys like us that feel these things the most.
Idealists.
Yeah, I just keep thinking about that quote.
"For evil to triumph, it only takes good men to do nothing."
But how?
You know, fucking how?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Gerry, I shouldn't be...
- It's all right.
- I'm just really tired.
You know, Nate, maybe you're going about this the wrong way.
Rallies, the speeches, the politics...
That's not how change is gonna come.
It's gonna come from the unknown soldiers, from the leaderless resistance.
How do you mean?
Let's go out back.
I made some improvements to the tree house.
Talking frankly is something we have to be very careful about.
- Something we always do outdoors.
- Right, of course.
You know, I've thinking about this for a long time, Nate, years really.
What's needed is an event.
What kind of event?
An event that wakes people up.
They're sleepwalkers out there.
They're blind.
Think about this regime.
Media brainwashing, secret courts, mass surveillance, Waco, Ruby Ridge.
Using Katrina and 9/11 to set up "refugee camps," or "detention camps", in other words; concentration camps, because who cares about the rights of a few Arabs, niggers and racists, if it makes us safer?
Right?
That's how it all starts.
All the lies that the Zionists tell about Nazi Germany, that's what's actually happening right now!
The irony of it!
Right?
That's why we gotta be smart.
That's why the event has to force the ZOG to show its hand.
It's gotta reveal the men behind the curtain.
Because it's not the event that wakes people up, it's the reaction to the event.
Yes!
Yes, you get it!
Yeah, Look at the Sons of Liberty.
Look at the IRA.
That is how you start a revolution.
Yeah, yeah, I always felt this kinship with you, Nate.
And...
I wanted to talk openly with you, but I just haven't known you that long, but, I know in my heart, I can trust you.
You can.
You can, Gerry, I want to help.
I want to make a difference.
Okay.
I still got connections from my Africa days.
Okay, and we have the means to create that kind of event.
But, Nate, if you get involved... we may not live to see the world we're building.
But I'll have helped to build it.
A man's body dies, but his deeds live forever.
There's a way you can help us.
- Okay, yeah.
- Come here.
We need to talk to the S.A.C., now!
Oh, my Lord, who the hell wrapped it?
You guys aren't trying to give it a bath!
Oh, hey, guys!
Sorry abut that, just having some technical difficulties over here.
- No problem!
- Be right over...
- Okay, one, two...
- Hey, Morgan, David...
I want you to meet somebody.
This is Nate.
Morgan, good to meet you.
- Greetings, sir.
I'm David.
- Hey, you guys.
So is the wedding out here?
Yeah, it's right over here.
It's beautiful, isn't it?
Wait till we see it all lit up.
Pure of spirit and pure of race, these two souls commit themselves to the defense and prosperity of their sacred blood.
May their sons and daughters fill this land, forever honoring their duty to folk, kindred, soil, and honor.
I know you guys don't know Nate that well.
But he's a good man and he's a good soldier.
If you trust me, you can trust him.
No luck yet.
No one wants to sell to an anonymous buyer.
If we give up that prepaid phone crap, I use my real name,
I got three guys I can get it from right now.
If we do it the morning of...
Yeah, I thought we were at least trying to do this without getting caught?
Guys, guys...
Nate has a potential solution for us.
TATP.
It's much better than ammonium nitrate anyway.
A smaller quantity will give you a much bigger blast.
Yeah, well, sure, but where are we gonna get that?
I run a medical supply company.
And you're gonna get TATP?
I know it's not the easiest thing, but, I've got some connections.
I can make a few calls and loop back with Gerry.
Assuming I can, what are we gonna do about the cesium powder itself?
Ready when we need it.
No, I mean, how are we going to handle it?
Well we've got heavy gloves, and we've got goggles.
No... radioactive particles will pass through those as easy as anything else, including your skin.
- Well, what do you suggest?
- I think we need suits.
They'll be pretty bulky, but we only need to wear them when the powder's out in the open.
When do we need them by?
Well, we've just been waiting for the explosive.
If you can get the TATP, Sunday is our day.
You guys remember Timothy McVeigh's last words?
Yeah, he read Invictus.
"It matters not how strait the gait, how charged with punishments the scroll,
I am the master of my fate:
I am the captain of my soul."
Are you sure this is gonna look right?
Wow.
Looks great.
The secret is the smell.
Where's the bleach powder?
Oh, it's right over here.
And you're sure they're not gonna try and test this somehow?
Yeah, that's why terrorists love TATP.
You can't identify it without a mass spectrometer.
Okay, if you say so.
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm here now.
Sunday, so team's in place Friday night.
Look, can I just say
I'm sorry about what I said to you the other day.
I was exhausted.
Don't worry about it.
That's what this job does to you.
Keep at it another ten years and you'll turn into a real asshole...
like me.
It's totally secure.
We can keep everything in here, and then, on game day, we can use this space to put it all together.
Great, great.
This is great, Nate.
And here... is... the TATP.
- No problems, inquiries?
- Nope.
All good.
Morgan's a pharmacist.
All right.
These crystals seem a little small.
Smells about right.
Okay, let's test it.
Test it?
You got a mass spectrometer in your bag?
No, we'll just see if it burns.
What?
No, whoa, whoa!
Hold on, what do you mean?
Burn it?
What are you talking about?
Well, we use a sample, we set it alight.
It burns for a while before it explodes.
I saw it on YouTube.
Are you insane?
Do you know how dangerous this stuff is?
...
Hey, you are not the only one with experience!
This is a highly unstable substance, okay?
It's sensitive to heat, friction...
Which is why I'll do the test carefully!
Now you want to see the video?
Because I have it here on my phone!
I don't give a shit about what's on your phone!
We are not lighting this stuff on fire!
You know how many bomb techs I saw get their faces blown off trying to deal with this stuff in Iraq?
I've worked with this company for two years!
They are not gonna send me a container full of baking soda, okay?
Gerry, this doesn't work for me, okay, if he doesn't trust me,
- or my suppliers...
- We need to test the fucking stuff!
You don't fucking trust me or my suppliers, that is your problem!
You want to use ammonium nitrate, fine with me!
- Okay.
Alright, alright,
- Fine with me.
Nate, Nate, Nate.
All right.
It's fine, it's fine.
Morgan, Morgan, he's right.
Come on.
He's right.
So, can we see the suits?
And it's kind of hard with the gloves, but... and you zip that up and fasten along there.
You guys, what would be worse, radiation poisoning or wearing this thing around for a couple hours?
Yeah.
So if you ever have any doubt white men created civilization, just go have a look.
How do you reason with someone like that?
How can you ever hope to change their mid?
Hello?
Hey, hey, listen, something's wrong.
David drove to Frederick County early this morning and went to a farm supply.
It looks like he bought ammonium nitrate.
And now they're all at Gerry's.
But it's Saturday?
And why do they need ammonium nitrate?
I don't know.
Me and Hernandez are heading over to meet the surveillance team at Gerry's now.
- What are you going to do?
- I don't know!
No!
No!
You can not raid them yet!
You don't even know if they have the cesium?
And Gerry's phone's off.
Okay, I have to go over there.
No, Nate!
It...
Nate... come here!
What are you doing here?
I was calling, you didn't answer.
I got worried.
- Bullshit!
Why are you here?
- I just told you!
I'm gonna give you one more chance.
Okay, what the fuck is wrong with this guy?
I called three times, you didn't answer any of them!
I got worried something happened to you!
Put it down, he's telling the truth!
- Were you followed?
- No, I wasn't!
- Are you sure?
- Yes!
I was worried, so I was checking constantly!
Okay, calm down, everybody calm down.
Okay, can somebody tell me what is going on?
I sent David to do surveillance on your shop last night.
I saw an electrical crew go into the building across the street.
- So?
- In the middle of the night?
Could there be like a power problem?
No, they must have traced the TATP you ordered.
- Okay, if they're on to the shop...
- Fuck.
...they're on to you.
You sure you weren't followed?
- Yes!
- If he said he wasn't, he wasn't!
Stay calm, keep your eyes open.
Morgan, get back to work, please, Jesus.
We had to move forward, immediately.
It would have been only a matter of time before they were on to us, too.
And you weren't gonna let me know?
Nate, I'm sorry.
It's too risky.
Well, he's here now, let's get him to help!
What about the TATP?
David got ammonium nitrate instead.
He used his name, so the jig is up.
They'll know it's us.
It's not gonna matter tomorrow.
We're in this to the end now, Nate.
Do you understand?
They're not gonna take us alive.
All right, let me help.
Okay, okay, good.
Come over here.
I...
I should go wash up so I don't contaminate anything.
Oh...
Hey, Nate!
How are you?
- Nate!
- The cesium is here!
All right, everyone!
Let's get ready to do this!
No!
Angela, you have to tell him to wait.
Wait?
No, no, no, we need to get in there now!
There are three guys in there with machine guns and they're building a bomb.
This is a residential neighborhood.
His wife and kids are in the house.
If you come in here now, it'll be a blood bath.
This is a volatile situation.
Yeah, which is why we need to move now...
No, he doesn't get it!
These guys are fanatics!
They will not be taken alive!
Tom, you're not in there!
We have to listen to him.
And what the fuck happens if the explosives go off while we're waiting around?
Nate, you got 60 seconds to disarm those guys, because we're coming in.
Okay, let's get these suits ready
Okay, let's get ready to move!
We are almost done here!
Fuck!
The cesium spilled!
Shit, get the suits on!
Go, go, go!
Come on!
Come on, help me!
Help me!
Get zipped up!
Get zipped up!
Son of a...
Shit, come on!
- Come on, get your hood on!
- No!
No!
You guys, stop!
Get the gun!
It's me!
It's me!
It's me!
Are you okay?
You all right?
- You all right?
- Yeah, no, I'm good, I'm good.
I know my rights!
I'm a patriot of the United States!
- Shut your fucking mouth!
- Fuck you!
Come on, get up!
Surprise!
The paperwork came in...
Houston.
Yeah...
Texas.
Can you believe it?
Good margaritas, I hear.
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm gonna miss it here, though.
Well, "it's" going to miss you, too.
"This should have been a noble creature;
he hath all the energy which would have made a goodly frame of glorious elements, had they been wisely mingled."
Gerry?
Yeah, Gerry, and all of them, really.
Yeah, that's why you were the right guy for the job.
What do you mean?
Why do you think I picked you?
I knew that you would understand them.
And they'd understand you.
And the more authentic you became with them, the more authentic they'd become with you.
Because when it comes down to it, there really is only one essential ingredient to fascism.
It's victimhood.
I blamed those... black kids, and I blamed this school,
I blamed the cops;
I blamed everybody.
I was gonna hurt everyone else the way they hurt me.
I look at you guys and I see myself.
But, you guys don't have to make the same mistakes I did.
You don't have to be victims.
Hey.
- Hey.
- Hey.
That was great.
Thanks.
Dude, thanks...
Thanks for coming by.
I'm so proud of you, Johnny.
You know what they say...
It all begins with the word.
You have the phone?
ShouldI doit now?
Notyet.
Waituntil wegetto thecheckpoint.
Okay, guys, this is it.
Hey, Ivy league's gun, put that gun back away.
- What are you talking about?
- I don't need some egghead who just scored an 81 on his qual shooting my dick off, okay?
This is my fucking guy!
I'm not just gonna sit here while you-- guys, enough!
Nate, just follow our lead, okay?
Is your heart clear?
Areyousure youwantto do this?
The signal will be better outside.
Here it is.
Did it work?
- Drop it!
- Freeze!
- Hands in the air!
- Turn around!
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
You have the right to an attorney.
Hello,usman.

AndI don'thaveany friends.
Oh, wow, he's a real prince, this one.
Can I get in there?
Salam aleikum.
What the fuck, tom?
I have this room at 4:00!
I know you don't get a lot of news downstairs, zamparo, but we just broke up a massive terrorist plot, all right?
Try and keep up.
Um...
What?
What is it?
Sir, when I flagged up this guy's email,
I thought the investigation was only gonna proceed if there was substantive criminal evidence to back it up.
We've got hours of him talking about waging jihad and killing children.
Right, but talking, though, sir, not... he's not doing anything.
Isn't that the point?
Hey, Tim.
How's it going?
You celebrating something, Nate?
You seeing someone special, huh?
Uh, yeah, actually.
How'd you guess?
Genius, emergency meeting in the conference room!
The crash was off 301 around 2:00 last night.
Local police controlled the scene, so, thankfully, the press knows nothing.
These containers carried cesium-137.
It's used for radiotherapy applications in hospitals, but it's highly regulated and had no business being on that truck.
When we tracked the shipment back to Baltimore, the customs record showed eight containers, not two.
So there's six more of them out there, all of them in the country illegally.
If that quantity made it's way into a radiological device, we could be looking at thousands of casualties, mass evacuations and radioactive contamination throughout the D.C. area.
- Tom?
- Yeah.
Uh, lab analysis puts the cesium coming from north Africa.
So the guys on four, they put together this map.
It's an analysis of Muslim communities in DC, Maryland and Virginia, along with their countries of origin.
We'd like each-- yes?
What about leads on the dt front?
Well, given the cesium came from north Africa, we don't think domestic is really in the picture.
The last time anyone tried to build a dirty bomb on us soil was James cummings.
He was a white supremacist living in Maine, he was going to set it off at Obama's inauguration.
He had uranium, thorium, and he was trying to acquire cesium.
I'm sure you're familiar with the case.
It goes without saying, anyone here is welcome to pursue any leads they think are fruitful.
Okay, would you fucking stop- oh, I'm so sorry.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- I'm Angela zamparo.
- Nate foster.
- I know.
You got a couple minutes?
Dt's downstairs.
There's only one perk to being down in this shithole.
Nicorette just isn't the same.
So, Nate...
You seem like you've got a bit more going on than most around here.
You remember Oklahoma city?
Well, yeah, i guess I was five, but sure.
What do you know about Timothy McVeigh?
Ah... he was some kind of lone extremist in a militia?
Don't be an asshole who bullshits questions you don't know the answer to.
Here.
Timothy McVeigh was a decorated Gulf war veteran.
He was not insane;
He was not a lunatic;
And he was not stupid.
He was a white supremacist, following a plan.
- What plan?
- A plan from a book called the Turner diaries.
It's about a "race war" to exterminate blacks, Jews, and "mud people."
You know how the war gets started?
The hero drives a truck bomb into a federal building.
Timothy McVeigh was reenacting that scene from the Turner diaries.
He was carrying the book with him when he was arrested.
What he was trying to do was start the race war.
You're focused on the islamic guys.
I get it.
We all create a narrative based on what we think is important.
We see what we want to see.
But just because you're not looking at something doesn't mean it's not there.
So, why are you telling me this?
I'm talking about a blood andguts,in thestreet, killorbe killedracewar.
Ihaveinformation abouta truckaccident outsideDClastnight, involvingclassified radioactivematerial.
ButnowtheFBI istrying tocoverit allup.
Why ?
Becausesomething bigishappening, andit'sbiggerthan9/11 , andit'sbiggerthan Oklahomacity.
Sobewarned, bearmed,andbeready.
His name is Dallas wolf.
He gets 20,000 listeners a night.
We believe he's based just outside of DC, but almost nobody knows him personally.
But I have an informant, a skinhead in a gang.
And the leader of that gang is friends with wolf.
So I need someone to get in there, and get close to him.
Right and I'm trying to tell you that this is not my thing!
I barely passed the pft!
What do you think undercover work is?
Beating guys up and shooting at them?
No, it's people skills.
It's controlling situations.
- It's this.
- Seriously?
This is the only undercover training you'll ever need.
I saw you with that Muslim kid.
You got most of this going on anyway.
Look, I read your file.
High IQ, great people skills, but not your typical FBI profile.
Introverted, an outsider, unhappy childhood.
Single mother, always moving around a lot, always the new kid, bullied at school, no close friends or-- okay, okay, okay, fuck you!
That's... this is an invasion.
What gives you the right to look-- because we don't have time to dick around here!
You don't smuggle a boatload of cesium into the country and then just let it fucking sit there!
Fine, but I'm trying to tell you,
I don't have the skills for this!
I can't even defend myself!
You do have the skills, and they mean you will never have to!
What did you say to that kid?
"You want to change things, so nobody has to suffer the way you did."

Are you out of your fucking mind?
Do you know how management looks at undercover, Nate?
You think this office is bad?
They'll have you chasing pedophiles on an Indian reservation.
I just want to discuss the option, sir.
Discuss the option?
Of what, of killing your whole career?

Oh, shut the fuck up!
Oh, what, so you want him to go in blind, so he has no idea what he's getting into?
You're just trying to manipulate him!
And you're not?
You do whatever the fuck you want.

It's my dd-214.
I was up all night Photoshop-ing it, so if anyone wants to see proof of my service in the marines, they can just-- what the fuck are you doing?
No, no, no, no.
Listen to me.
If you get yourself in a situation where you have to show somebody your dd-214, then you're already done.

So what do they want from you?
My loyalty?
I'm loyal, I'm dedicated to the the cause.
No.
Any thug can be loyal.
What do you have...
What the guys with the cesium... are gonna want?
Welcome to medvale medical supply company.
My military contacts helped me start this business.
Most of our sales are online.
Our radiotherapy products are specifically designed for the handling and storing of radioactive material.
So we can acquire sensitive materials and hide them.
Hisnameis frankhedges.
He'sbeenacifortwoyears.
He's in a gang called the panzer strikeforce, and the leader of the gang is this guy.

He's friends with Dallas wolf.

This is my friend Nate i was telling you about.
Hey, everybody.
14/88, brother.
Good to meet you.
All right, spread 'em.
Roy does our security.
Okay, fine.
Whoa, whoa, hey, what the fuck is that?
- What's what?
- That!
Under your fucking shirt there!
What is that?
Hey, are you a cop?
Hey, look me in my fucking eyes, boy!
Are you a fucking cop?
- No, I'm not.
- No?
Whoo!
He's fine.
Sorry about that, Nate.
But you know how it is.
- Yeah, absolutely.
- Whoa, whoa.
Have a seat.
You drink bud?
Uh, yeah, absolutely.
Frank tells me you were in Iraq.
Uh, yeah, three years in the corps.
- You kill anybody?
- Johnny!
He's Johnny.
He's a fresh cut.
We're trying to teach him the ropes.
I know the fuckin' ropes, man.
Yeah, then mind your fucking manners!
So, did you?
Kill anybody?
I don't talk about that.
But what I did see was a lot of our guys go down.
Good guys... friends.
And for what?
I was on a wmd squad, the whole reason we were there, except we didn't find shit, did we?
Hmm.
So then I get home, i started listening to Dallas wolf.
Oh, yeah?
Dallas and I go way back.
Oh, there's a guy I'd love to meet, you know.
He's somebody who's telling the truth.
He's out there, he's asking why were we there?
And the answer's always the same.
Iraq, 9/11, osama bin laden, what does it all come back to?
Look at every war we've ever been in.
How many white men slaughtered their brothers in world war ii?
What, like a 100 million?
And for who?
Who's always pulling the strings?
It's all here in front of us.
But most people are blind.
Look at this bottle.
You see anything funny?
You're talking about the Jew tax?
What's the Jew tax?
Tell 'em, Nate.
Start looking at the food you buy, and you'll see this little "u."
The union of orthodox rabbis gets paid to perform a "blessing" on everything in the grocery store.
For this "blessing," they rake in billions of dollars in taxes.
We can't control the ketchup, but we can control the streets.
That's how it went down in Germany.
And we think of ourselves as a sturm abteilung.
We are a thinking man's soldiers.
First here.
And then here.
And that is where the revolution starts.
We're not these tired old kkk guys, waiting for some catastrophe to start a race war.
- We're the catastrophe.
- That's fucking right.
And we need guys like you, with military backgrounds.
We need best practices in our security.
Come on, man, I think our fucking security is pretty good.
Well, always room to improve, though, right?
Oh, yeah?
Like what?
Well, like, look at the position of this booth and then tell me, without looking, where the nearest exits are.
- What's your point?
- The point is, of all the large booths in this restaurant, you picked the one farthest from the exits.
If something goes down, we're fucked.
No, we're ready for whatever goes down.
Yeah, with only you and him, i don't know your name yet, I'm sorry, carrying?
Oh, and how the fuck you think you know that?
When you pat someone down so they're facing everybody's lap, it's pretty easy to tell.
You spend three years in Iraq, you learn how to scan a room.
And see threats.
Well, isn't that fucking impressive.
Now I only got one question for you.
What?
Why are you wearing levis?
Levis?
Your fucking Jew jeans?
Yeah, no, sorry, i just couldn't help notice when I was patting' you down.
While you were doing your little detective work all up in everybody's lap.
So why are you wearing them?
Because when i got home from Iraq, my brother gave me these jeans... as a homecoming gift.
Now, does he understand the struggle we're in?
No.
But I'm sure as shit not gonna let a zionist conglomerate keep me from wearing them.
You wanna boycott the Jews?
You ever look at the fortune 500?
You'll be living in a fucking cave.
He's right.
Shit, they probably own this place, too.
Frank tells me you run a medical supply company now?
Yeah.
Yeah, my military contacts helped me set up.
We're just starting out, but we got access to a lot of stuff.
That's great.
I'd love to talk to you about that sometime.
Yeah... anytime.
You know, when I was 13, i actually played soccer.
One day, I came into the locker room, right?
And there were these six niggers, and they had this friend of mine, this Irish kid, down in the stalls, right?
His head was up against the toilet, and his face was just covered,
I mean, covered in blood, like flaps of skin.
I'd never seen anyone get beaten like that.
And when I came in, they just stared at me.
They stared, and I...
I walked away...
And just left him.
I hated those motherfuckers.
Yeah, when I was your age, i got pushed around a lot.
- Yeah?
- It fucking sucks.
But you can use that.
Yeah, but with these guys, nobody can do shit to me.
I learned to be proud.
Strong!
- Yeah, but-- - to be an Aryan fucking warrior!
Isn't that right, Johnny?
All right, so what, are we gonna stand around all night
- or we gonna get fucking drunk!
- Let's go!
Come on, junior, let's get some fucking beer, motherfucker!
Come on, boy!
Get in there, boy!
Hey, Nate, you know what, man?
Everybody seems to really fucking like you.
Yeah.

What's the matter, man?
You didn't hear me?
I just... uh...
You sleep well?
What's wrong?
Oh, yeah, no, we know where you live.
- Yup.
- Right.
Cool.
Yeah, so, what, you're not gonna invite us in?
Yeah, come on in.
Oh, thanks, man, so sweet of you.
It's a mess, sorry.
Welcome.
You mind?
Yeah, it's a cool place, man.
Yeah, but it kind of looks like you just moved in.
So, what are you guys doing here?
Aw, don't break my heart.
What are we doing here?
Come on, don't make it sound like you're not happy to see me.
See Vince is outside.
He's got a little surprise for you.
Oh, hey, well, um...
Yeah, well, I'm ready.
Let's go.
You're gonna be psyched, man!
It's fucking awesome!
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Cool, well, I'm good to go.
Let's head out.
- Let's go, Roy.
- What's the rush?
I'm coming.
What the fuck?
What the fuck is that?
Goddamn, man, you got some fucking shitty-ass furniture up in here, huh?
Yep.
Cheap as shit.
- All right, you ready?
- Yeah, I'm ready.
Sieg heil, motherfucker, let's go.
Sieg fucking hell.
Youdidn't finishyourtranscript.
Yeah,I know,I'llget toit.
Lookatmy fuckingarm !
Andwhatthefuck isgoingon withthisguyRoy?
You make him look small, you make him into an enemy.
Sometimes, Angela, it would just be great to hear, "good job."
I'm only so hard on you because I'm trying to protect you.
You have to remember your objective here.
This is about getting to Dallas wolf.
So what do I do about that?
Try relating to these guys as human beings.
You know?
Open up to them, if you can.
You may have more in common with them than you think.
Man, why the fuck does Vince make us come to this shit?
"Good networking, lots of movement guys." I mean, who gives a fuck?
Well, is Dallas wolf gonna be here?
Who the fuck knows?
I don't listen to that talk radio bullshit.
Fuck!
Goddamn.
Hey, that looks good on you, man.
Yeah, thanks.
Um, just go in,
I got another shirt in the cargo.
Hi, you must be Vince's friend Nate!
- I'm Becky, Gerry's wife.
- Oh, hi, nice to meet you.
- Such a pleasure to have you.
- Thank you for having me.
Yeah, of course.
Hey, Nate, i made some cupcakes.
The frosting is a little messed up, but they taste good.
So,Dallas,we wanted...
Nate!
Come check this out.
Isittrue, thisDallaswolfunityrally isthelargestevent you'vehostedin years?
Absolutely.
We'vebroughttogether thebiggestwhiteseparatist organizations in the northeast.
Andwe'realso havinga conference, withsomeof theworld's preeminentracialscholars.

They'replanningon viciouslyattacking peacefuldemonstrators withhockeysticks andd batteries andurineballoons.
Notonlythat.
They'rebusingin hundreds of protestors from the DC area.
ButallIcan say is, theaflbetterbecareful.
Because while we come in peace, we'recertainly notafraidof war.
Fuck.
Yeah.
God, that's the first I'm hearing about this rally.
I mean, god knows you can't get any real news on the yidivision, but still...
Are you planning on going, Nathan?
And this is Andrew Blackwell from the Aryan alliance.
- Hail victory, brother.
- Hail victory.
The Aryan alliance, huh?
I've read a lot about you guys.
Well, we're the premiere white nationalist group in the world, so that's not surprising.
Earnest walton, grand dragon, good to meet you.
Good to meet you.
Earnest is with the local klan.
Yeah, you should stop by one of our meetings.
- We'd love to have you.
-
- Oh, wow.
You should check out our website, too.
We're always looking for quality people.
Ah, I don't think Nate's into all that religious stuff.
Excuse me?
Religious stuff?
I just think Nate is a little more rational than that.
I'm not sure I know what you mean by that.
Come on, Nate.
Let's go back and get some food.
Stay away from those faggots.
They got this fucked up religion where they think the Bible was written for white men and aryans are the lost tribes of Israel.
The Bible.
Jews invented christianity.
Jews invented the printing press, and the Bible is the most published book in the world.
I mean, anything seem off to you?
How about the fact the romans conquered every mud race on earth, and then christianity finished them off in a hundred years?
You gotta know who to stick with in this movement.
You're with us.
Goddamn it, Vince, every time we come here, the whole fuckin' place is dry!
- What the fuck, man?
- It's two hours, be good.
Gerry, there's somebody I want you to meet.
This is Nate.
- Hey, Gerry Conway.
- Nate Thomas, nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.
Vince told me all about you.
Make yourself at home.
I am throwing on some veggie burgers.
Thanks for having us.
- Hi!
- Hey, hey, I'm Nate.
- Madeline.
Nice to meet you.
- Hey, Madeline.
- This is Timmy.
- Hey, Timmy.
You want to come see our tree house?
Uh, yeah, sure, where are we going?
Oh, right, yeah, there.
Oh, wow, that is great!
Did your dad build this?
- I built it!
- You built this?
- But my daddy helped.
- Okay.
Wow.
- It's to protect us.
- Yeah, from what?
If the mud people come.
Always be ready.
Always be watchful and stick together.
You guys kidnapping my guest?
- Huh?
Huh?
This is amazing, man.
Well, I've always been good with my hands.
And it was just wonderful to have a project with the kids.
You know how you spell love, Nate?
T-i-m-e.
Ninety percent of the time you'll ever spend with your kids
- comes before the age of 12.
- Wow.
Yeah.
You been in the movement long, Nate?
Um, not long.
Just since i got back from Iraq.
Oh, yeah, right.
Yeah, Vince told me you served.
- Mm-hm.
- Mm-hm.
Hey, Nate, don't take this the wrong way but you kind of seem a little mature for a skinhead.
Really?
Yeah.
Yeah, maybe.
I don't know.
Um, what about you?
You seem to know a lot of people in this movement.
Ah, they probably come for the free food.
Ah, no.
You have these barbecues often?
Yeah, as much as I can, yes, you know,
I try to create a positive environment for everybody in the community, and a place for us to come together and be healthy in body and spirit.
"Fuck you, bitch!" And he turned around, and he's like-- guys!
Guys!
Language, please.
Kids.
Jesus fucking Christ.
It makes me so sad to see those two.
They gotta clean up their act.
Well, how do you mean?
Well, the cigarettes, and alcohol, the language.
This is what's happening to our young Aryan men.
Yeah.
To be honest, now that I met you,
I'm kind of surprised you invited those guys.
Well, you can't exclude them.
I mean, they're the next generation.
They need our help.
Need to understand their heritage, and be proud of it.
That's what it's all about, isn't it?
The children.
What kind of a world will they grow up in?
Goddamn, man, that was the worst fucking party on earth.
Jesus Christ, what kind of bullshit vodka is this, man?
Man, that's the last time i ever let you pick it out.
Man, look at that shit.
Look at that!
That is just fucking...
God, that is so fucking awful!
Man, look at that, look at that beautiful Aryan woman and that fucking...
Roy, come on, let's go the fuck home.
No, no, man, we're gonna teach these two a lesson.
- No!
- Get your fucking hands off of me!
Don't you ever fucking touch me again.
You hear me?
We're Aryan warriors, right?
That means we got a responsibility to do something about shit like this.
Hey, you two!
You need to get the fuck out of here!
Hold on, what did you say?
I said, get the fuck out of here or we're gonna kill you, you fucking spic!
What the fuck is your problem?
- What's our problem?
-
- Yeah.
You come into our country, you fuck our women.
Yeah, you got some big fucking balls, huh?
- Put the fucking knife down and calm down, all right, man?
- Oh, my god!
They get the point.
You thought you were a big man, huh?
He gets it, Roy!
He's fucking shaking.
I thought you were a big man.
- Put the fucking knife down!
- Fuck you, motherfucker!
I'll fucking gut you, you piece of shit!
Now go, fucker!
- Come on, let's go!
- Shit!
Fuck, Nate.
Goddamn it!
You're fucking lucky!
What the fuck is your problem?
You fucked the whole thing up!
Yeah, I think they got the message, Roy!
Got the message?
Are you a fucking idiot?
Man, those two were mine!
And then your dumb fucking ass decides...
Hang on, wait a minute...
First you tried to stop me, then you try to scare them off, and then you set off that fucking alarm.
That wasn't an accident, was it?
Was it, Nate?
You wanted them to get away.
What the fuck, Nate?
Huh?
I said what the fuck?
Okay, you're goddamn right i wanted them to get away!
You want to be a soldier, Roy and not a fucking thug?
Then think!
You think about security cameras, Roy?
You think about the liquor store we were just in?
You think about the clerk or the license plates on my fucking truck?
You think about any of that shit?
Fucking Aryan warrior...
A hundred spics and niggers ain't worth the life of one white man, but go ahead, put us all in prison.
That's how you're gonna win your race war?
Huh?
Fuck!
All right, whatever, can we just get back on the road and get the fuck out of here?
Fuck!
Iranthoselicenseplates.
Anaccountant,aschool teacher,a lawyer,fireman, he'sanengineer, not a criminal record in sight, butAndrewBlackwell, he'sa differentstory.
Whyishe here?
Uh, he said he was going to wolf's rally.
He's the national director of the Aryan alliance.
They're based in Ohio, he wouldn't just come all this way to be in a rally.
Wait, if wolf is involved in this, he can't be doing it alone, right?
I mean, he'd need help, and organization.
Exactly, so you need to figure out how wolf and Blackwell are connected, and why he's really here.
Vince, good to see you.
Rich, can we get some literature, please?
- White power.
- White power.
Okay, we're gettin' ready to get started here.
Can everyone take a seat?
MosttimesI'dtalkedtoyou,

I'lltellyou.
It will be a world like the one that shaped our race in Europe.
Aworldof forests, mountains,andlakes.
Nota worldof concrete, asphalt,andgarbage.
Andinsteadof 300million race-lessmulattos, breedingandinfesting.
Imaginea continent of50millionwhiteEuropeans.

That'sthenation wecanbuild...together.
If you take millions of white people, and flood every country in Africa with them, what do they call that?
Genocide.
But what's happening to every white country on earth?
You've got affirmative action that kills white jobs.
Abortion, that kills white babies.
Gay rights, that kill white families.
Folks, let me explain something to you.
"Diversity" is a code word.
And what it means is white genocide!
So, we'll begin marching at the courthouse.
And after two blocks-- wait a minute, wait a minute.
This is not the order that we agreed to.
Aryan alliance is supposed to be heading this march.
Now just a second, Andrew.
You know, we're at this rally every year, and we start with the colonial patriots.
Well, this isn't "every year," is it?
To be fair, Harris, maybe we should.
You're a local organization...
Vince, can you introduce me to Dallas?
"The klan"?
You're not "the klan."
Yeah, sure.
Come on, let's go.
You're the "invisible white knights" of the ku klux klan!
Which is what, the third klan group in the DC Metro area?
!
Hey, Dallas!
Good to see you.
It's... it's Vince, Vince sargent?
Right, Vince.
Good to see you.
Good to see you.
I want to introduce you to my good friend, this is Nate Thomas.
- I'm a huge fan of your show.
- Thank you, sir.
If you'll excuse me.
I have to get ready for the march.
- Uh, Mr. wolf?
- Yes, what is it?
I didn't want to get into this in front of Vince, but I'd like to talk to you about an investment.
- An "investment"?
- Mm-hm.
I represent a few people who are big fans of yours, and they want to help.
- Is that so?
- Yes, sir.
They have a number of assets in the online media space, and they feel the potential for your show is being limited by your advertising budget.
They want to help you penetrate some new markets, and they see no reason why you can't go nationwide.
Well, that is great, son.
That is just great.
Here, call this number and we'll talk.
Okay, great.
That sounds great, Mr. wolf.
- Call me, Dallas.
- Thank you.
Racist scum!
Racist scum!
We're here today because we're proud of our race!
We love our race!
And we're here to say that.
- White power!
-
- White power!
The white race is under attack in this country.
- White rights!
-
- White rights!
But nobody seems to give a damn!
- White freedom!
-
- White freedom!
- Where's al sharpton?
-
- Fuckin' rednecks!
Where's Jesse Jackson to fight for white rights!
- White power!
-
- White power!
White equality!
- White pride!
-
- White pride!
If you're white, and you are standing over there...
- White freedom!
-
- White freedom!
...you're on the wrong side of that barricade!
- White rights!
-
- White rights!
Nate!
Wake up, white people!
Wake up!
- White power!
-
- White power!
It's morning in America and there's a new day coming.
- Nate!
What are you doing, man?
- Shut the fuck up, nigger!
Come join your race!
That's some fucker that works in my building.
Come join the white race!
White race!
- White power!

- White power!
- White power!
- White power!
Racist scum!
Racist scum!
Racist bum!
It's the fucking afl.
Don't worry, they won't do shit.
Well, well, well, if it isn't the American fucking losers!
Yeah, fuck you!
Why don't you come over the fucking barricade, motherfuckers!
Johnny!
Hey, man, just fucking stay back, okay?
- Don't fucking do it.
- I gotta help him.
Help him by not getting the fuck arrested, okay?
- Fucking pussies!
-
- White Nazi scum!
Yeah, you know what?
I can do that shit, too.
I'm gonna fucking kill you, motherfucker!
- Do not engage.
Do not engage.
- You think I'm playing around?
I'm gonna fucking kill you!
Get your hands off of me!
I'm gonna kill these motherfuckers!
Stay back!
- White power!
-
- White pride!
- White power!
-
- White pride!
He hit me in the fucking eye!
It's fucking piss!
Johnny!
Andrew, can you walk?
Get the fuck outta here.
You okay?
Everyone okay?
Sorry.
Okay.
Stay with us.
I'm getting you out of here, man.
Go... go right, go right!
Oh, fuck!
- Fuck!
- Fucking...
Holy shit!
We gotta go!
We gotta fucking go!
I can't fucking go anywhere!
Stay down!
Fuck!
No, don't get up.
You need to rest.
I brought you some chamomile tea.
It'll help you relax.
Thank you.
There's our wounded warrior.
How you feeling, buddy?
Yeah, much better.
Thank you, guys.
Ah, no problem.
I'm gonna put some music on.
I brought you Sammy to keep you company.
Thanks.
Oh, wow.
You like it?
I...
I love brahms.
See, Becky, i knew he was quality.
I think the fourth is my favorite.
Yeah, mine, too.
Except maybe the-- the first?
Yeah.
Now listen, if you like brahms,
I've got this clarinet quintet that will blow your mind.
They're dead, Gerry.
Dead.
I'm gonna find them, and we're gonna string them up-- alright, I hear ya.
I hear ya.
That's why I avoid the political stuff.
Not my thing.
Besides, I've heard it can be dangerous.
That was fantastic.
Thank you...
I thought you guys were vegetarians.
Everybody's gotta have a few vices every now and then.
What's "vices"?
Oh, boy, there we go!
I'm sorry about that, that's my ride.
Gerry, Becky, thanks for everything.
Nathan, I don't know what to say.
I owe you, big time.
Why don't you stop by the compound some time.
Oh, I'm not really in Ohio that much, but I'd love to if I ever am.
No, I meant the...
The new one.
- Oh.
- Here in Virginia.
Oh, right, yeah, please, I'd love to.
- Bye.
- Have a good night.
Bye, Andrew!
Well, listen, you're not going to believe it, but when it comes to tchaikovsky...
Gotta go with Bernstein.
- Leonard Bernstein?
- I know, I know.
Gerry, I hate to break it to you, man--
I know.
Listen, I can't help it, he's a great conductor.
Jews listen to Wagner, don't they?
So, Gerry, if you don't mind my asking, how did you end up in the movement?
Listen, for me, it was the books.
My parents were practically liberals.
Totally blinded by the zog.
You know, I always knew something was wrong;
and I had this anger,
I couldn't put my finger on it, until here.
It all started with this.
I was 13.
Read it in four days.
It explains race, culture, capitalism and how democracy destroyed western civilization.
Democracy:
"Three people form a government.
Then two of them vote to steal the wealth of the third."
- David Lane, right?
- Mm-hm.
Now here's something more recent.
You'll love this.
This breaks down the entire worldwide zionist conspiracy, step by step.
- You can bring it back.
- Oh, no, I couldn't.
Nate, Nate, please.
But that was it?
I mean, it was just books woke you up?
Well, you know, i had my theories.
And then a three-month engineering contract opened up in Kenya.
I was young, i wanted to see the world.
And, uh, Nate, listen,
I got no problem with them having their own country, everybody should.
But if you go there, and you see, they weren't even living like animals.
You know, animals don't live in their own feces, do they?
So, if you ever have any doubt white men created civilization, just go have a look.
Hey.
So,howwasthe brahms?
Howdoyoureason withsomeonelikethat?
Howcanyoueverhope tochangetheirmind?
Listen,youneedtorememberwhyyou're doingthis.
We'renotsocialworkers.
Youwantedme to relate to them as human beings, right?
"Openupto them?"You said.
...theyweren'teven livinglikeanimals.
Youwantto getadrink?
Wherearewe gonnago andgetadrink?
This suspect, he was a fucking nightmare.
He was grabbing my ass, the whole thing.
And he kept insisting i go to this club with him, where I knew he was gonna make his big move, but if I didn't go, then, you know, I could blow my whole cover.
So what did you do?
So we're at a bar, and I tell him I want oysters.
So I get a dozen, i start plowing through them.
Then I start acting queasy.
I run to the bathroom, stick my finger down my throat.
- No way!
- Yeah!
So now there's puke all over my dress,
I tell him I got sick off the oysters and take a cab home.
Two days later, he was arrested.
- That is fucking awesome.
- Oh, it was fucked up.
But there was the thrill, you know?
That high.
God, there's nothing like it.
Yeah, so why'd you stop?
It was just it's no way to live, the paranoia, the tension.
And I wanted to spend more time with my kids.
You got kids?
You don't think I'm mommy material?
No, no... no.
Yeah, I got two princesses.
Mommy and daddy.
Perfect, little suburban life.
Anyway, I know how lonely this work can be.
But the case won't go forever.
You can't change the way people think, but you are making a difference.
Nathan, good to see you.
Can we get you anything, coffee?
Oh, no, I'm good, thanks.
This is a great set-up you got here.
Yeah, thanks.
All right, let's give you the tour.
This parcel is actually pretty small, but we're purchasing the one next to it.
Although, citizen's groups are trying to block us out.
Oh, yeah.
How are you handling that?
Well, we tell them we're here to stay.
Make no mistake about it.
We show up at their homes, their businesses, their churches.
They backed down pretty quick after that.
So you're moving the national headquarters?
No, we're keeping the compound in Ohio, it's just with everything going on right now, we needed a stronger presence here.
You know?
- Is that your firing range?
- Yeah, come on.
It's a little primitive, but we're working on it.
I'm no marksman, by any means, but I have some expertise in range design, just from training the Iraqi police.
What's your danger area template?
To contain your cone of fire.
I mean, how do you control your overshoot?
Uh...
We haven't gotten to that yet.
Okay, well, you might want to make sure it's the kikes and niggers getting hit and not your guys.
Absolutely.
Maybe if you have time,
- you could talk to the guys about it.
- Yeah, sure,
I need to see what kind of equipment you've got, but I'm happy to.
Okay.
Uh, come on up here.
Right now were just using this for storage.
- Are those cots?
- Yup.
We'll be able to sleep 200 in there.
And we're gonna need to.
I'm not gonna beat around the bush.
You see the type of organization we have here, but we could always use a man like you, Nathan.
Educated, war veteran, clean record.
I mean, hell, you don't even have any parking tickets.
Yeah, we have our contacts in law enforcement, local, state, federal, not to mention military hospitals, laboratories, you name it.
And so what's the overall objective here?
I mean, are you just trying to get the message out, or what?
Get the... get the message out?
To who?
We're not trying to recruit the public here.
What would we do with them?
They're at home sitting on their asses,
- watching sitcoms and surfing Facebook.
This is revolutionary activity we're talking about here.
Look, I'm flattered by the interest, but, you know,
I've been around the movement awhile now and a lot of these guys are all talk.
Now for me to really want to get involved,
I need to know there's bigger things going on here.
No offense.
Yeah... none taken.
All right...
Take a look at this.
This is the entire DC water system.
Plants, pipelines, the whole deal.
Now, Nathan, the guys you're hanging out with, they're all talk, because they're punks.
They're amateurs.
They sit around drinking beer all day, maybe they beat up a few niggers or each other.
We got no use for them.
We need men like you.
Can I help you?
I'm looking for Dallas wolf, but I must have the wrong house.
Oh, no, he's here.
Come in.
Randy!
Someone's here!
Hey, Nate.
The studio's back here.
I'm moving studios right now, so this is all temporary.
Oh, no, this is a great setup.
Thanks for taking the time to see me, Dallas.
I just spent the afternoon with Andrew at the Aryan alliance.
Oh, yeah?
Andrew's great.
They have an incredible organization.
Yeah, they seem really serious about the struggle.
About doing whatever it takes.
They're true patriots, those guys.
Well, let me give you a bit of background on me.
I was in Iraq for three years, on a wmd squad.
And then when I got back, my military contacts helped me set up a medical supply company.
V-a-l-e.
Wow, this is great.
Yeah, we do it all, from bandages and syringes to X-ray and radiotherapy equipment.
And with the highly regulated stuff, we can cut through a lot of the red tape and deal directly, and discreetly.
Fantastic, Nate.
Great to know.
So... you'd also mentioned an investment?
For the show?
Yes, I've got an investor lined up who's very excited about expanding your reach.
We're talking advertising, marketing, bigger servers...
That's exactly what I need.
So how do I meet him?
Well, a lot of my military contacts don't like to publicize their efforts.
But he'd love for you to put together a proposal about how you'd expand the show.
Funny you should mention that.
I've been trying to raise $7,500 to break into the Florida market.
They're ripe right now, with all the immigration stuff.
Yeah... yeah, this is great!
So, there's one more thing.
Go ahead, shoot.
The reason he's helping you is because he feels that you are a man of action, as he is.
As I am.
Right, sure.
So for him to move forward, he needs to know you're serious about this.
Nate, I've been ready to give my life for this cause for 20 years now.
What I need is the right people behind me.
So you tell your investor that if he wants action, he's got the right guy.
Um, sorry, Dallas, I've got kind of a long drive back, you mind if I hit the head?
The whole case is about to blow wide open!
He's in with wolf, he's in with the Aryan alliance.
Yeah, and all we need to keep wolf on the line is that $7,500!
Let me get this straight.
So after everything we spent on your cover, even after the medical supply business, you want me to ask for $7,500 asan"investment" inthisguy'sradioshow ?
You're the only one with a budget right now!
Oh, yeah, I'm just flush with cash!
I'm trying to run a 40-man investigation ontopof allthe shit I'vealreadygot!
Sir, the alliance is building a compound outside DC.
Wolf's house is setting off a geiger counter!
I spent six hours last night reading your transcripts,
Nate, you don't have shit!
Youdon'thaveshit!
Look at how much carbon is built up on this bolt.
- See?
See that?
Like-- - yeah.
That's unacceptable.
When's the last time you cleaned this?
I've been meaning to get to most of them.
Okay, guys, seriously!
Okay, so we got an ar-15, serial number a00724, needs a new buffer spring.
Come on, guys, let's go!
We need to go through the whole inventory.
Andrew's waiting on this.
I'm gonna have to tell Andrew, the only way it's gonna change is with new policies.
And how do I know it's not me you're trying to fuck?
Fuck you, you calling us liars?
You get on the phone yourself!
Call them up and ask them...
Hey, guys...
Hey, Nate...
It's been a while.
Yeah, you kinda disappeared on us.
I'm sorry about that, Vince.
I've been kind of busy.
Yeah, I bet you have.
Seems like you made a bunch of new friends around here, huh?
See, we were just wondering if maybe you could explain--
Roy!
Thanks for stopping by.
Be seeing you, Nate.
What was that all about?
Roy says the police have been following him.
He's paranoid about infiltrators.
Infiltrators, huh?
Yeah.
Mm.
That's why the police are on his ass?
Have you seen how that guy behaves?
It's a miracle he's not in jail already.
Right, uh, you want to help us with something?
Sure, what's up?
I'm throwing a youth event for Hitler's birthday.
There's a campground a couple miles from here.
- Help us scout it.
- Sounds good.
It's amazing how much land there is right outside DC.
Let me ask you something, Nathan.
What's your opinion on infiltration?
Well, how do you mean?
How do we prevent it?
Well, it's tough.
For one thing, you gotta keep guys with rap sheets out of important positions.
That's... that's how they flip most people.
We have a polygraph back at the compound.
Maybe we should make everybody take it.
I mean, i think someone who's trained can beat a polygraph without blinking.
Yeah, maybe we should just do a background checks for everybody.
Get everyone's records and documents together?
Yeah, I mean, for informants, that might work.
But for law enforcement, they just forge whatever they need.
Yeah, but with a few phone calls, you know, a cover only runs so deep.
Do you suspect someone?
You know, it's like they say at these rallies.
You look to the left, look to the right, one of these people is a snitch.
It's the left.
Turn left right up here.
You okay there, Nate?
You look a little off?
No, I'm good.
Just, uh, tired...
Been a long day.
Well, I think this is a great location.
What do you think?
Yeah, I like it.
Uh, well, what about the permits, though?
We tell them we're a Christian organization, holding a youth event.
I gotta ask you something.
Roy said he contacted the nprc.
Said there's no record of you having served in the marines.
You mean Roy went and filed a 180 with a government that he fucking hates, just to... okay.
I was on a wmd squad, so that's black ops.
And he knows that, the fucker.
Wait, hold on, are you guys taking this seriously?
Is that what that was all about in the truck?
Because, I understand you have to do your due diligence or whatever, but that's a fucking serious accusation!
I don't need to take that shit from anybody!
- Hey... hey, hey!
- Least of all from--
okay.
Let's get out of here.
Nate,listen.
Weneedtogettheserial numbers first,andthen- - no, look, I don't have time for that!
What if he wasn't convinced?
What if he calls wolf?
The account name is Nate foster, please.
You don't know if he was convinced!
You don't even know if they talk, okay?
You're being-- yeah, I'd like $7,500 in cash.
You're a man of your word, which is a rare thing in this movement.
So, listen, Dallas, my investor is very excited, but he wants to know some more about what you're planning, some details.
Oh, okay, I think it was all in the presentation, but we start with online in tampa, and then we move down the- no, no, I mean, beyond that.
- Beyond Florida?
Beyond the show, like what we talked about.
The actions we're gonna take.
I'm sorry, Nate.
I lost you.
What do you mean?
What I mean is, you have been talking a lot about a lot of big things that are coming.
Bigger than Oklahoma city, bigger than 9/11-- oh, yeah, for sure.
Which is why expanding the show is so important.
Right, and I have been spending a lot of time with Andrew at the Aryan alliance.
He told me you'd been working together.
Well, yeah, sure, i mean, he came to the rally.
No, no, what my investor needs to know is what are the concrete steps that you are taking to start the race war.
As I said to you before,
I have the expertise, the connections, the tools.
Maybe there's some kind of misunderstanding.
I thought we were talking about expanding the show.
Yeah, which my investor is happy to do, but if you're not willing to be honest about the other actions you're taking, then he's not gonna be able to support you.
Okay, Nate, fair enough.
Sorry it didn't work out.
I saw the plans, Dallas, for the water system.
Andrew showed them to me, okay?
So, I know all about it, and now I just need you to stop pretending and be honest with me.
This is private property.
You're no longer welcome here.
I'm asking you to leave.
Come on, Dallas.
I'm on your side.
Get the fuck out.
Now.
Fuck.
We'regoingto theoffice,
Dallaswolfis there.
Youbroughthimin?
No.
Hecametous.
Sir.
I didn't know you'd be here.
Has anyone talked to him?
No, no, of course not.
No, it's your show.
So, Dallas.
Or should I call you Randy?
That is your real name.
You can call me whatever you like, agent zamparo.
Any reason you're using an assumed name?
I'm a public entertainer.
Ah... fine.
So, tell me why you're here today.
I'm here because of the guy I called about.
He shows up at my conference, talking about investing in my show.
Butthen,he 'stellingme howhecanget highlyregulateditems.

That's a lot.

Right.
Let me play you something, okay, Randy.
Ihaveinformation abouta truckaccident outsideDClastnight, involvingclassified radioactivematerial, butnowtheFBI istrying tocoverit allup.
Why ?
You've gotta be kidding me.
It's a radio show.
It's entertainment!
So you think it's entertaining to predict and incite terrorist attacks?
Whether I think it's entertaining is irrelevant.
Why don't you talk to somebody around here who knows something about the law, preferably a man!
Brandenburgvs.Ohio,1969, itisnotillegal toadvocateviolence.
Thefirstamendment doesn't protect people who have knowledgeofan actualcrime!
What knowledge of a crime do I have?
Well, why don't you tell me, Randy?
What is this accident?
What is this FBI cover-up?
Why are you living at an unregistered address?
And why is that location lighting up a geiger counter?
You've been following me?
You've been casing my house?
Why don't you answer my questions?
Letmeshowyou something.

- Now, tom, look...
- Now, tom, look, what?
Really, what could you possibly have to say?
Because this is a fucking disaster!
I warned you, i tried to tell you.
- We still might have a weapons case!
- We ran those serial numbers.
Every single one of those guns is legally registered.
Every one!
Okay, so you think there's nothing to any of this?
Right?
The prepaid cellphones?
The barracks for 200 guys?
- The water system plans?
- They're conspiracy theorists!
It's all talk!
He keeps those plans around to trot out when he wants to act like a big shot!
What are they gonna do, they're gonna put radioactive material in the water supply?
That doesn't make any fucking sense!
You two, you pull this from here and that from there, and you're making up this whole big fucking story in your head, and it's bullshit!
You know, we see what we want to see!
Well, now you've compromised him, and you've compromised the bureau, and you've wasted all our fucking time!
This happens sometimes, you know?
- I mean, it sucks, but-- - "this happens"?
Is that all you're gonna fucking say after we find out all of this?
Everything you fucking put me through has been for nothing?
It's the nature of the work.
No!
This... this happened because of your pet theory!
And like an idiot, i went along with it!
"Oh, yeah, she's an expert," i thought.
"She knows what she's doing!"
I'm sorry, Nate.
Fucking why?
Why are you even sorry?
This has been great for you!
You got the thrill back!
You got the excitement you've been wanting, you got an escape from your little suburban life,
- by manipulating me!
- No, that is not fair!
I thought we had a case!
God, do you even know how many dead ends I've been down?
No, you fucking knew!
You knew I was so eager, so desperate to do something meaningful, to actually work on a real case in this place, that I would do anything you wanted, while you just sat back and enjoyed the ride!
Yeah.
Fuck!
Nate!
Hey, good to see you!
I've been calling you!
Yeah, I know, I'm sorry about that, I've been really busy.
I just wanted to return these.
I'm heading out of town for a couple of months, gonna work on setting up the business on the west coast.
Oh, wow, wow, well, please come in.
Uh, that's nice of you, but I don't think I can.
Aw, come on, just for a cup of tea?
Is everything okay, Nate?
Yeah, yeah, why do you ask?
Well, you said you're headed out west.
Yeah, I'm gonna work on setting up the business on the west coast.
Right.
God, it's hard to find what we're looking for in life.
But then, I listen to something like that.
One man made something...
That will make millions, maybe billions of people feel the way we just did.
We all have that power, Nate.
All of us.
Honestly...
I used to feel that way, Gerry.
I always felt like i could change the world.
You know, I could right wrongs, you know, fight injustice.
Nate, listen, it's guys like us that feel these things the most.
Idealists.
Yeah, I just keep thinking about that quote.
"For evil to triumph, it only takes good men to do nothing."
But how?
You know, fucking how?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Gerry, i shouldn't be...
- It's all right.
- I'm just really tired.
You know, Nate, maybe you're going about this the wrong way.
The rallies, the speeches, the politics...
That's not how the change is gonna come.
It's gonna come from the unknown soldiers, from the leaderless resistance.
How do you mean?
Let's go out back.
I made some improvements to the tree house.
Talking frankly is something we have to be very careful about.
- Something we always do outdoors.
- Right, of course.
You know, I've thinking about this for a long time, Nate, years really.
What's needed is an event.
What kind of event?
An event that wakes people up.
They're sleepwalkers out there.
They're blind.
Think about this regime.
Media brainwashing, secret courts, mass surveillance, waco, Ruby Ridge.
Using Katrina and 9/11 to set up "refugee camps," or "detention camps", in other words, concentration camps, because who cares about the rights of a few arabs, niggers and racists, if it makes us safer?
Right?
That's how it all starts.
All the lies that the zionists tell about Nazi Germany, that's what's actually happening right now!
The irony of it!
Right?
That's why we gotta be smart.
That's why the event has to force the zog to show its hand.
It's gotta reveal the men behind the curtain.
Because it's not the event that wakes people up, it's the reaction to the event.
Yes!
Yes, you get it!
Yeah, look at the sons of Liberty.
Look at the ira.
That is how you start a revolution.
Yeah, yeah, I always felt this kinship with you, Nate.
And...
I wanted to talk openly with you, but I just haven't known you that long, but I know in my heart, i can trust you.
You can.
You can, Gerry, i want to help.
I want to make a difference.
Okay.
I still got connections from my Africa days.
Okay, and we have the means to create that kind of event.
But, Nate, if you get involved we may not live to see the world we're building.
But I'll have helped to build it.
A man's body dies, but his deeds live forever.
There's a way you can help us.
- Okay, yeah.
- Come here.
We need to talk to the s.A.C., now!
Oh, my lord, who the hell wrapped it?
You guys aren't trying to give it a bath!
Oh, hey, guys!
Sorry abut that, just having some technical difficulties over here.
- No problem!
- Be right over...
- Okay, one, two...
- Hey, Morgan, David...
I want you to meet somebody.
This is Nate.
Morgan, good to meet you.
- Greetings, sir.
I'm David.
- Hey, you guys.
So is the wedding out here?
Yeah, it's right over here.
It's beautiful, isn't it?
Wait till we see it all lit up.
Pure of spirit and pure of race, these two souls commit themselves to the defense and prosperity of their sacred blood.
May their sons and daughters fill this land, forever honoring their duty to folk, kindred, soil, and honor.
Iknowyouguys don'tknowNatethatwell .
But he's a good man and he's a good soldier.
If you trust me, you can trust him.
No luck yet.
No one wants to sell to an anonymous buyer.
If we give up that prepaid phone crap, i use my real name,
I got three guys i can get it from right now.
If we do it the morning of-- yeah, I thought we were at least trying to do this without getting caught?
Guys, guys, shh.
Nate has a potential solution for us.
Tatp.
It's much better than ammonium nitrate anyway.
A smaller quantity will give you a much bigger blast.
Yeah, well, sure, but where are we gonna get that?
I run a medical supply company.
And you're gonna get tatp?
I know it's not the easiest thing, but I've got some connections.
I can make a few calls and loop back with Gerry.
Assuming I can, what are we gonna do about the cesium powder itself?
Ready when we need it.
No, I mean, how are we going to handle it?
Well we've got heavy gloves, and we've got goggles.
No... radioactive particles will pass through those as easy as anything else, including your skin.
- Well, what do you suggest?
- I think we need suits.
They'll be pretty bulky, but we only need to wear them when the powder's out in the open.
When do we need them by?
Well, we've just been waiting for the explosive.
If you can get the tatp, Sunday is our day.
You guys remember Timothy McVeigh's last words?
Yeah, he read invictus.
"It matters not how strait the gait, how charged with punishments the scroll,
I am the master of my fate:
I am the captain of my soul."
Are you sure this is gonna look right?
Wow.
It looks great.
The secret is the smell.
Where's the bleach powder?
Oh, it's right over here.
And you're sure they're not gonna try and test this somehow?
Yeah, that's why terrorists love tatp.
You can't identify it without a mass spectrometer.
Okay, if you say so.
Yeah.
Uh-huh, yeah, I'm here now.
Sunday, so team's in place Friday night.
Look, can I just say
I'm sorry about what i said to you the other day.
I was exhausted.
Don't worry about it.
That's what this job does to you.
Keep at it another ten years and you'll turn into a real asshole...
like me.
It's totally secure.
We can keep everything in here, and then, on game day, we can use this space to put it all together.
Great, great.
This is great, Nate.
And here is the tatp.
- No problems, inquiries?
- Nope.
All good.
Morgan's a pharmacist.
All right.
Hm, these crystals seem a little small.
Smells about right.
Okay, let's test it.
Test it?
You got a mass spectrometer in your bag?
No, we'll just see if it burns.
What?
No, whoa, whoa!
Hold on, what do you mean?
Burn it?
What are you talking about?
Well, we use a sample, we set it a light.
It burns for a while before it explodes.
I saw it on YouTube.
Are you insane?
Do you know how dangerous this stuff is?
Hey, you are not the only one with experience!
This is a highly unstable substance, okay?
It's sensitive to heat, friction-- which is why I'll do the test carefully!
Now you want to see the video?
Because I have it here on my phone!
I don't give a shit about what's on your phone!
We are not lighting this stuff on fire!
You know how many bomb techs i saw get their faces blown off trying to deal with this stuff in Iraq?
I've worked with this company for two years!
They are not gonna send me a container full of baking soda, okay?
Gerry, this doesn't work for me, okay, if he doesn't trust me, or my suppliers-- we need to test the fucking stuff!
You don't fucking trust me or my suppliers, that is your problem!
You want to use ammonium nitrate, fine with me!
- Okay.
- Fine with me.
Nate, Nate, Nate.
It's all right.
It's fine, it's fine.
Morgan, Morgan, he's right.
Come on.
He's right.
So, can we see the suits?
And it's kind of hard with the gloves, but... and you zip that up and fasten along there.
You guys, what would be worse, radiation poisoning or wearing this thing around for a couple hours?
Yeah.
Soifyoueverhave anydoubt white men created civilization, justgohavealook .
Howdoyoureason withsomeonelikethat?
Howcanyoueverhope tochangetheirmind?
Hello?
Hey, hey, listen, something's wrong.
David drove to Frederick county earlythismorning andwentto afarmsupply.
Itlookslikehebought ammoniumnitrate.
And now they're all at Gerry's.
But it's Saturday?
And why do they need ammonium nitrate?
I don't know.
Me and Hernandez are heading over to meet the surveillance team at Gerry's now.
- What are you going to do?
- I don't know!
No!
No!
You can not raid them yet!
You don't even know if they have the cesium?
And Gerry's phone's off.
Okay, I have to go over there.
No,Nate!
It--
- What are you doing here?
- I was calling, you didn't answer.
I got worried.
- Bullshit!
Why are you here?
- I just told you!
I'm gonna give you one more chance.
Okay, what the fuck is wrong with this guy?
I called three times, you didn't answer any of them!
I got worried something happened to you!
All right, put it down!
He's telling the truth!
- Were you followed?
-
- No, I wasn't!
- Are you sure?
- Yes!
I was worried, so I was checking constantly!
Okay, calm down, everybody calm down.
Okay, can somebody tell me what is going on?
I sent David to do surveillance on your shop last night.
I saw an electrical crew go into the building across the street.
- So?
- In the middle of the night?
Could there be like a power problem?
No, they must have traced the tatp you ordered.
- Okay, if they're on to the shop...
- Fuck.
...they're on to you.
Are you sure you weren't followed?
- Yes!
- If he said he wasn't, he wasn't!
Stay calm and keep your eyes open.
Morgan, get back to work, please, Jesus.
We had to move forward, immediately.
It would have been only a matter of time before they were on to us, too.
And you weren't gonna let me know?
Nate, I'm sorry.
It's too risky.
Well, he's here now, let's get him to help!
What about the tatp?
David got ammonium nitrate instead.
He used his name, so the jig is up.
They'll know it's us.
It's not gonna matter tomorrow.
We're in this to the end now, Nate.
Do you understand?
They're not gonna take us alive.
All right, let me help.
Okay, okay, good.
Come over here.
I should go wash up so I don't contaminate anything.
Oh...
Hey, Nate!
How are you?
- Nate!
- The cesium is here!
All right, everyone!
Let's get ready to do this!
No!
Angela, you have to tell him to wait.
Wait?
No, no, no, we need to get in there now!
There are three guys in there with machine guns and they're building a bomb.
This is a residential neighborhood.
His wife and kids are in the house.
Ifyoucomeinhere now, it'llbeabloodbath .
This is a volatile situation.
Yeah, which is why we need to move now...
No, he doesn't get it!
These guys are fanatics!
They will not be taken alive!
Tom, you're not in there!
We have to listen to him.
And what the fuck happens if the explosives go off whilewe'rewaitingaround?
Nate,yougot60seconds todisarmthoseguys, becausewe'recomingin.
Okay, let's get these suits ready.
Okay, let's get ready to move!
We are almost done here!
Fuck!
The cesium spilled!
Shit, get the suits on!
Go, go, go!
Come on!
Come on, help me!
Help me!
Get zipped up!
Get zipped up!
Son of a...
Shit, come on!
- Come on, get your hood on!
- No!
No!
...stop!
Get the gun!
It's me!
It's me!
It's me!
Are you okay?
You all right?
- You all right?
- Yeah, no, I'm good, I'm good.
I know my rights!
I'm a patriot of the United States!
- Shut your fucking mouth!
- Fuck you!
Come on, get up!
Surprise!
Thepaperworkcamein...
Houston.
Yeah...
Texas.
Can you believe it?
Good margaritas, I hear.
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm gonna miss it here, though.
Well, "it's" going to miss you, too.
"This should have been a noble creature;
he hath all the energy which would have made a goodly frame of glorious elements, had they been wisely mingled."
Gerry?
Yeah, Gerry, and all of them, really.
Yeah, that's why you were the right guy for the job.
What do you mean?
Why do you think I picked you?
I knew that you would understand them.
And they'd understand you.
And the more authentic you became with them, the more authentic they'd become with you.
Because when it comes down to it, there really is only one essential ingredient to fascism.
It'svictimhood.
I blamed those black kids, and I blamed this school,
I blamed the cops;
I blamed everybody.
I was gonna hurt everyone else the way they hurt me.
I look at you guys and I see myself.
But you guys don't have to make the same mistakes I did.
You don't have to be victims.
Hey.
- Hey.
- Hey.
That was great.
Thanks.
Dude, thanks...
Thanks for coming by.
I'm so proud of you, Johnny.
You know what they say...
It all begins with the word.
You have the phone?
ShouldI doit now?
Notyet.
Waituntil wegetto thecheckpoint.
Okay, guys, this is it.
Hey, Ivy league's gun, put that gun back away.
- What are you talking about?
- I don't need some egghead who just scored an 81 on his qual shooting my dick off, okay?
This is my fucking guy!
I'm not just gonna sit here while you-- guys, enough!
Nate, just follow our lead, okay?
Is your heart clear?
Areyousure youwantto do this?
The signal will be better outside.
Here it is.
Did it work?
- Drop it!
- Freeze!
- Hands in the air!
- Turn around!
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
You have the right to an attorney.
Hello,usman.
Ican helpyou.
Icangetyou phonecallswith yourparents,yourfriends...

AndI don'thaveany friends.
Oh, wow, he's a real prince, this one.
Can I get in there?
Salam aleikum.
What the fuck, tom?
I have this room at 4:00!
I know you don't get a lot of news downstairs, zamparo, but we just broke up a massive terrorist plot, all right?
Try and keep up.
Um...
What?
What is it?
Sir, when I flagged up this guy's email,
I thought the investigation was only gonna proceed if there was substantive criminal evidence to back it up.
We've got hours of him talking about waging jihad and killing children.
Right, but talking, though, sir, not... he's not doing anything.
Isn't that the point?
Hey, Tim.
How's it going?
You celebrating something, Nate?
You seeing someone special, huh?
Uh, yeah, actually.
How'd you guess?
Genius, emergency meeting in the conference room!
The crash was off 301 around 2:00 last night.
Local police controlled the scene, so, thankfully, the press knows nothing.
These containers carried cesium-137.
It's used for radiotherapy applications in hospitals, but it's highly regulated and had no business being on that truck.
When we tracked the shipment back to Baltimore, the customs record showed eight containers, not two.
So there's six more of them out there, all of them in the country illegally.
If that quantity made it's way into a radiological device, we could be looking at thousands of casualties, mass evacuations and radioactive contamination throughout the D.C. area.
- Tom?
- Yeah.
Uh, lab analysis puts the cesium coming from north Africa.
So the guys on four, they put together this map.
It's an analysis of Muslim communities in DC, Maryland and Virginia, along with their countries of origin.
We'd like each-- yes?
What about leads on the dt front?
Well, given the cesium came from north Africa, we don't think domestic is really in the picture.
The last time anyone tried to build a dirty bomb on us soil was James cummings.
He was a white supremacist living in Maine, he was going to set it off at Obama's inauguration.
He had uranium, thorium, and he was trying to acquire cesium.
I'm sure you're familiar with the case.
It goes without saying, anyone here is welcome to pursue any leads they think are fruitful.
Okay, would you fucking stop- oh, I'm so sorry.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- I'm Angela zamparo.
- Nate foster.
- I know.
You got a couple minutes?
Dt's downstairs.
There's only one perk to being down in this shithole.
Nicorette just isn't the same.
So, Nate...
You seem like you've got a bit more going on than most around here.
You remember Oklahoma city?
Well, yeah, i guess I was five, but sure.
What do you know about Timothy McVeigh?
Ah... he was some kind of lone extremist in a militia?
Don't be an asshole who bullshits questions you don't know the answer to.
Here.
Timothy McVeigh was a decorated Gulf war veteran.
He was not insane;
He was not a lunatic;
And he was not stupid.
He was a white supremacist, following a plan.
- What plan?
- A plan from a book called the Turner diaries.
It's about a "race war" to exterminate blacks, Jews, and "mud people."
You know how the war gets started?
The hero drives a truck bomb into a federal building.
Timothy McVeigh was reenacting that scene from the Turner diaries.
He was carrying the book with him when he was arrested.
What he was trying to do was start the race war.
You're focused on the islamic guys.
I get it.
We all create a narrative based on what we think is important.
We see what we want to see.
But just because you're not looking at something doesn't mean it's not there.
So, why are you telling me this?
I'm talking about a blood andguts,in thestreet, killorbe killedracewar.
Ihaveinformation abouta truckaccident outsideDClastnight, involvingclassified radioactivematerial.
ButnowtheFBI istrying tocoverit allup.
Why ?
Becausesomething bigishappening, andit'sbiggerthan9/11 , andit'sbiggerthan Oklahomacity.
Sobewarned, bearmed,andbeready.
His name is Dallas wolf.
He gets 20,000 listeners a night.
We believe he's based just outside of DC, but almost nobody knows him personally.
But I have an informant, a skinhead in a gang.
And the leader of that gang is friends with wolf.
So I need someone to get in there, and get close to him.
Right and I'm trying to tell you that this is not my thing!
I barely passed the pft!
What do you think undercover work is?
Beating guys up and shooting at them?
No, it's people skills.
It's controlling situations.
- It's this.
- Seriously?
This is the only undercover training you'll ever need.
I saw you with that Muslim kid.
You got most of this going on anyway.
Look, I read your file.
High IQ, great people skills, but not your typical FBI profile.
Introverted, an outsider, unhappy childhood.
Single mother, always moving around a lot, always the new kid, bullied at school, no close friends or-- okay, okay, okay, fuck you!
That's... this is an invasion.
What gives you the right to look-- because we don't have time to dick around here!
You don't smuggle a boatload of cesium into the country and then just let it fucking sit there!
Fine, but I'm trying to tell you,
I don't have the skills for this!
I can't even defend myself!
You do have the skills, and they mean you will never have to!
What did you say to that kid?
"You want to change things, so nobody has to suffer the way you did."
Adirtybomb isanykindofcrude, explosivedevice thatwhendetonated, dispersesradiation aroundandbeyondthe blast.

Are you out of your fucking mind?
Do you know how management looks at undercover, Nate?
You think this office is bad?
They'll have you chasing pedophiles on an Indian reservation.
I just want to discuss the option, sir.
Discuss the option?
Of what, of killing your whole career?

They slit your throat, and they pull your tongue right out through it?
Oh, shut the fuck up!
Oh, what, so you want him to go in blind, so he has no idea what he's getting into?
You're just trying to manipulate him!
And you're not?
You do whatever the fuck you want.
But you better think long and hard about this.

What else?
What's this?
It's my dd-214.
I was up all night Photoshop-ing it, so if anyone wants to see proof of my service in the marines, they can just-- what the fuck are you doing?
No, no, no, no.
Listen to me.
If you get yourself in a situation where you have to show somebody your dd-214, then you're already done.

Principle #3:
Arouse in the other person an eager want.
So what do they want from you?
My loyalty?
I'm loyal, I'm dedicated to the the cause.
No.
Any thug can be loyal.
What do you have...
What the guys with the cesium... are gonna want?
Welcome to medvale medical supply company.
My military contacts helped me start this business.
Most of our sales are online.
Our radiotherapy products are specifically designed for the handling and storing of radioactive material.
So we can acquire sensitive materials and hide them.
Hisnameis frankhedges.
He'sbeenacifortwoyears.
He's in a gang called the panzer strikeforce, and the leader of the gang is this guy.
Vince sargent.
He's friends with Dallas wolf.
So Vince and Dallas wolf are tight?
Yeah, I told you, Vince calls into wolf's show every week.
Sofrankbringsyou intothegang, youhangout, getsomecredibility, youmaketheseguyslike you.
YougetclosetoVince.
Then,youusehim togetto knowwolf.
This is my friend Nate i was telling you about.
Hey, everybody.
14/88, brother.
Good to meet you.
All right, spread 'em.
Roy does our security.
Okay, fine.
Whoa, whoa, hey, what the fuck is that?
- What's what?
- That!
Under your fucking shirt there!
What is that?
Hey, are you a cop?
Hey, look me in my fucking eyes, boy!
Are you a fucking cop?
- No, I'm not.
- No?
Whoo!
He's fine.
Sorry about that, Nate.
But you know how it is.
- Yeah, absolutely.
- Whoa, whoa.
Have a seat.
You drink bud?
Uh, yeah, absolutely.
Frank tells me you were in Iraq.
Uh, yeah, three years in the corps.
- You kill anybody?
- Johnny!
He's Johnny.
He's a fresh cut.
We're trying to teach him the ropes.
I know the fuckin' ropes, man.
Yeah, then mind your fucking manners!
So, did you?
Kill anybody?
I don't talk about that.
But what I did see was a lot of our guys go down.
Good guys... friends.
And for what?
I was on a wmd squad, the whole reason we were there, except we didn't find shit, did we?
Hmm.
So then I get home, i started listening to Dallas wolf.
Oh, yeah?
Dallas and I go way back.
Oh, there's a guy I'd love to meet, you know.
He's somebody who's telling the truth.
He's out there, he's asking why were we there?
And the answer's always the same.
Iraq, 9/11, osama bin laden, what does it all come back to?
Look at every war we've ever been in.
How many white men slaughtered their brothers in world war ii?
What, like a 100 million?
And for who?
Who's always pulling the strings?
It's all here in front of us.
But most people are blind.
Look at this bottle.
You see anything funny?
You're talking about the Jew tax?
What's the Jew tax?
Tell 'em, Nate.
Start looking at the food you buy, and you'll see this little "u."
The union of orthodox rabbis gets paid to perform a "blessing" on everything in the grocery store.
For this "blessing," they rake in billions of dollars in taxes.
We can't control the ketchup, but we can control the streets.
That's how it went down in Germany.
And we think of ourselves as a sturm abteilung.
We are a thinking man's soldiers.
First here.
And then here.
And that is where the revolution starts.
We're not these tired old kkk guys, waiting for some catastrophe to start a race war.
- We're the catastrophe.
- That's fucking right.
And we need guys like you, with military backgrounds.
We need best practices in our security.
Come on, man, I think our fucking security is pretty good.
Well, always room to improve, though, right?
Oh, yeah?
Like what?
Well, like, look at the position of this booth and then tell me, without looking, where the nearest exits are.
- What's your point?
- The point is, of all the large booths in this restaurant, you picked the one farthest from the exits.
If something goes down, we're fucked.
No, we're ready for whatever goes down.
Yeah, with only you and him, i don't know your name yet, I'm sorry, carrying?
Oh, and how the fuck you think you know that?
When you pat someone down so they're facing everybody's lap, it's pretty easy to tell.
You spend three years in Iraq, you learn how to scan a room.
And see threats.
Well, isn't that fucking impressive.
Now I only got one question for you.
What?
Why are you wearing levis?
Levis?
Your fucking Jew jeans?
Yeah, no, sorry, i just couldn't help notice when I was patting' you down.
While you were doing your little detective work all up in everybody's lap.
So why are you wearing them?
Because when i got home from Iraq, my brother gave me these jeans... as a homecoming gift.
Now, does he understand the struggle we're in?
No.
But I'm sure as shit not gonna let a zionist conglomerate keep me from wearing them.
You wanna boycott the Jews?
You ever look at the fortune 500?
You'll be living in a fucking cave.
He's right.
Shit, they probably own this place, too.
Frank tells me you run a medical supply company now?
Yeah.
Yeah, my military contacts helped me set up.
We're just starting out, but we got access to a lot of stuff.
That's great.
I'd love to talk to you about that sometime.
Yeah... anytime.
You know, when I was 13, i actually played soccer.
One day, I came into the locker room, right?
And there were these six niggers, and they had this friend of mine, this Irish kid, down in the stalls, right?
His head was up against the toilet, and his face was just covered,
I mean, covered in blood, like flaps of skin.
I'd never seen anyone get beaten like that.
And when I came in, they just stared at me.
They stared, and I...
I walked away...
And just left him.
I hated those motherfuckers.
Yeah, when I was your age, i got pushed around a lot.
- Yeah?
- It fucking sucks.
But you can use that.
Yeah, but with these guys, nobody can do shit to me.
I learned to be proud.
Strong!
- Yeah, but-- - to be an Aryan fucking warrior!
Isn't that right, Johnny?
All right, so what, are we gonna stand around all night
- or we gonna get fucking drunk!
- Let's go!
Come on, junior, let's get some fucking beer, motherfucker!
Come on, boy!
Get in there, boy!
Hey, Nate, you know what, man?
Everybody seems to really fucking like you.
Yeah.
Thisismy friendNate Iwastellingyou about.
Hey,everybody.

Inthebeginningwas the word.
Bearmedandbeready.
- Hey!
- Hey.
What's the matter, man?
You didn't hear me?
I just... uh...
You sleep well?
What's wrong?
Oh, yeah, no, we know where you live.
- Yup.
- Right.
Cool.
Yeah, so, what, you're not gonna invite us in?
Yeah, come on in.
Oh, thanks, man, so sweet of you.
It's a mess, sorry.
Welcome.
You mind?
Yeah, it's a cool place, man.
Yeah, but it kind of looks like you just moved in.
So, what are you guys doing here?
Aw, don't break my heart.
What are we doing here?
Come on, don't make it sound like you're not happy to see me.
See Vince is outside.
He's got a little surprise for you.
Oh, hey, well, um...
Yeah, well, I'm ready.
Let's go.
You're gonna be psyched, man!
It's fucking awesome!
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Cool, well, I'm good to go.
Let's head out.
- Let's go, Roy.
- What's the rush?
I'm coming.
What the fuck?
What the fuck is that?
Goddamn, man, you got some fucking shitty-ass furniture up in here, huh?
Yep.
Cheap as shit.
- All right, you ready?
- Yeah, I'm ready.
Sieg heil, motherfucker, let's go.
Sieg fucking hell.
Youdidn't finishyourtranscript.
Yeah,I know,I'llget toit.

Andwhatthefuck isgoingon withthisguyRoy?
You make him look small, you make him into an enemy.
Sometimes, Angela, it would just be great to hear, "good job."
I'm only so hard on you because I'm trying to protect you.
You have to remember your objective here.
This is about getting to Dallas wolf.
So what do I do about that?
Try relating to these guys as human beings.
You know?
Open up to them, if you can.
You may have more in common with them than you think.
Man, why the fuck does Vince make us come to this shit?
"Good networking, lots of movement guys." I mean, who gives a fuck?
Well, is Dallas wolf gonna be here?
Who the fuck knows?
I don't listen to that talk radio bullshit.
Fuck!
Goddamn.
Hey, that looks good on you, man.
Yeah, thanks.
Um, just go in,
I got another shirt in the cargo.
Hi, you must be Vince's friend Nate!
- I'm Becky, Gerry's wife.
- Oh, hi, nice to meet you.
- Such a pleasure to have you.
- Thank you for having me.
Yeah, of course.
Hey, Nate, i made some cupcakes.
The frosting is a little messed up, but they taste good.
So,Dallas,we wanted...
Nate!
Come check this out.

Because while we come in peace, we'recertainly notafraidof war.
Fuck.
Yeah.
God, that's the first I'm hearing about this rally.
I mean, god knows you can't get any real news on the yidivision, but still...
Are you planning on going, Nathan?
And this is Andrew Blackwell from the Aryan alliance.
- Hail victory, brother.
- Hail victory.
The Aryan alliance, huh?
I've read a lot about you guys.
Well, we're the premiere white nationalist group in the world, so that's not surprising.
Earnest walton, grand dragon, good to meet you.
Good to meet you.
Earnest is with the local klan.
Yeah, you should stop by one of our meetings.
- We'd love to have you.
-
- Oh, wow.
You should check out our website, too.
We're always looking for quality people.
Ah, I don't think Nate's into all that religious stuff.
Excuse me?
Religious stuff?
I just think Nate is a little more rational than that.
I'm not sure I know what you mean by that.
Come on, Nate.
Let's go back and get some food.
Stay away from those faggots.
They got this fucked up religion where they think the Bible was written for white men and aryans are the lost tribes of Israel.
The Bible.
Jews invented christianity.
Jews invented the printing press, and the Bible is the most published book in the world.
I mean, anything seem off to you?
How about the fact the romans conquered every mud race on earth, and then christianity finished them off in a hundred years?
You gotta know who to stick with in this movement.
You're with us.
Goddamn it, Vince, every time we come here, the whole fuckin' place is dry!
- What the fuck, man?
- It's two hours, be good.
Gerry, there's somebody I want you to meet.
This is Nate.
- Hey, Gerry Conway.
- Nate Thomas, nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.
Vince told me all about you.
Make yourself at home.
I am throwing on some veggie burgers.
Thanks for having us.
- Hi!
- Hey, hey, I'm Nate.
- Madeline.
Nice to meet you.
- Hey, Madeline.
- This is Timmy.
- Hey, Timmy.
You want to come see our tree house?
Uh, yeah, sure, where are we going?
Oh, right, yeah, there.
Oh, wow, that is great!
Did your dad build this?
- I built it!
- You built this?
- But my daddy helped.
- Okay.
Wow.
- It's to protect us.
- Yeah, from what?
If the mud people come.
Always be ready.
Always be watchful and stick together.
You guys kidnapping my guest?
- Huh?
Huh?
This is amazing, man.
Well, I've always been good with my hands.
And it was just wonderful to have a project with the kids.
You know how you spell love, Nate?
T-i-m-e.
Ninety percent of the time you'll ever spend with your kids
- comes before the age of 12.
- Wow.
Yeah.
You been in the movement long, Nate?
Um, not long.
Just since i got back from Iraq.
Oh, yeah, right.
Yeah, Vince told me you served.
- Mm-hm.
- Mm-hm.
Hey, Nate, don't take this the wrong way but you kind of seem a little mature for a skinhead.
Really?
Yeah.
Yeah, maybe.
I don't know.
Um, what about you?
You seem to know a lot of people in this movement.
Ah, they probably come for the free food.
Ah, no.
You have these barbecues often?
Yeah, as much as I can, yes, you know,
I try to create a positive environment for everybody in the community, and a place for us to come together and be healthy in body and spirit.
"Fuck you, bitch!" And he turned around, and he's like-- guys!
Guys!
Language, please.
Kids.
Jesus fucking Christ.
It makes me so sad to see those two.
They gotta clean up their act.
Well, how do you mean?
Well, the cigarettes, and alcohol, the language.
This is what's happening to our young Aryan men.
Yeah.
To be honest, now that I met you,
I'm kind of surprised you invited those guys.
Well, you can't exclude them.
I mean, they're the next generation.
They need our help.
Need to understand their heritage, and be proud of it.
That's what it's all about, isn't it?
The children.
What kind of a world will they grow up in?
Goddamn, man, that was the worst fucking party on earth.
Jesus Christ, what kind of bullshit vodka is this, man?
Man, that's the last time i ever let you pick it out.
Man, look at that shit.
Look at that!
That is just fucking...
God, that is so fucking awful!
Man, look at that, look at that beautiful Aryan woman and that fucking...
Roy, come on, let's go the fuck home.
No, no, man, we're gonna teach these two a lesson.
- No!
- Get your fucking hands off of me!
Don't you ever fucking touch me again.
You hear me?
We're Aryan warriors, right?
That means we got a responsibility to do something about shit like this.
Hey, you two!
You need to get the fuck out of here!
Hold on, what did you say?
I said, get the fuck out of here or we're gonna kill you, you fucking spic!
What the fuck is your problem?
- What's our problem?
-
- Yeah.
You come into our country, you fuck our women.
Yeah, you got some big fucking balls, huh?
- Put the fucking knife down and calm down, all right, man?
- Oh, my god!
They get the point.
You thought you were a big man, huh?
He gets it, Roy!
He's fucking shaking.
I thought you were a big man.
- Put the fucking knife down!
- Fuck you, motherfucker!
I'll fucking gut you, you piece of shit!
Now go, fucker!
- Come on, let's go!
- Shit!
Fuck, Nate.
Goddamn it!
You're fucking lucky!
What the fuck is your problem?
You fucked the whole thing up!
Yeah, I think they got the message, Roy!
Got the message?
Are you a fucking idiot?
Man, those two were mine!
And then your dumb fucking ass decides...
Hang on, wait a minute...
First you tried to stop me, then you try to scare them off, and then you set off that fucking alarm.
That wasn't an accident, was it?
Was it, Nate?
You wanted them to get away.
What the fuck, Nate?
Huh?
I said what the fuck?
Okay, you're goddamn right i wanted them to get away!
You want to be a soldier, Roy and not a fucking thug?
Then think!
You think about security cameras, Roy?
You think about the liquor store we were just in?
You think about the clerk or the license plates on my fucking truck?
You think about any of that shit?
Fucking Aryan warrior...
A hundred spics and niggers ain't worth the life of one white man, but go ahead, put us all in prison.
That's how you're gonna win your race war?
Huh?
Fuck!
All right, whatever, can we just get back on the road and get the fuck out of here?
Fuck!
Iranthoselicenseplates.

Uh, he said he was going to wolf's rally.
He's the national director of the Aryan alliance.
They're based in Ohio, he wouldn't just come all this way to be in a rally.
Wait, if wolf is involved in this, he can't be doing it alone, right?
I mean, he'd need help, and organization.
Exactly, so you need to figure out how wolf and Blackwell are connected, and why he's really here.
Vince, good to see you.
Rich, can we get some literature, please?
- White power.
- White power.
Okay, we're gettin' ready to get started here.
Can everyone take a seat?

It will be a world like the one that shaped our race in Europe.
Aworldof forests, mountains,andlakes.
Nota worldof concrete, asphalt,andgarbage.
Andinsteadof 300million race-lessmulattos, breedingandinfesting.
Imaginea continent of50millionwhiteEuropeans.

If you take millions of white people, and flood every country in Africa with them, what do they call that?
Genocide.
But what's happening to every white country on earth?
You've got affirmative action that kills white jobs.
Abortion, that kills white babies.
Gay rights, that kill white families.
Folks, let me explain something to you.
"Diversity" is a code word.
And what it means is white genocide!
So, we'll begin marching at the courthouse.
And after two blocks-- wait a minute, wait a minute.
This is not the order that we agreed to.
Aryan alliance is supposed to be heading this march.
Now just a second, Andrew.
You know, we're at this rally every year, and we start with the colonial patriots.
Well, this isn't "every year," is it?
To be fair, Harris, maybe we should.
You're a local organization...
Vince, can you introduce me to Dallas?
"The klan"?
You're not "the klan."
Yeah, sure.
Come on, let's go.
You're the "invisible white knights" of the ku klux klan!
Which is what, the third klan group in the DC Metro area?
!
Hey, Dallas!
Good to see you.
It's... it's Vince, Vince sargent?
Right, Vince.
Good to see you.
Good to see you.
I want to introduce you to my good friend, this is Nate Thomas.
- I'm a huge fan of your show.
- Thank you, sir.
If you'll excuse me.
I have to get ready for the march.
- Uh, Mr. wolf?
- Yes, what is it?
I didn't want to get into this in front of Vince, but I'd like to talk to you about an investment.
- An "investment"?
- Mm-hm.
I represent a few people who are big fans of yours, and they want to help.
- Is that so?
- Yes, sir.
They have a number of assets in the online media space, and they feel the potential for your show is being limited by your advertising budget.
They want to help you penetrate some new markets, and they see no reason why you can't go nationwide.
Well, that is great, son.
That is just great.
Here, call this number and we'll talk.
Okay, great.
That sounds great, Mr. wolf.
- Call me, Dallas.
- Thank you.
Racist scum!
Racist scum!
We're here today because we're proud of our race!
We love our race!
And we're here to say that.
- White power!
-
- White power!
The white race is under attack in this country.
- White rights!
-
- White rights!
But nobody seems to give a damn!
- White freedom!
-
- White freedom!
- Where's al sharpton?
-
- Fuckin' rednecks!
Where's Jesse Jackson to fight for white rights!
- White power!

White equality!
- White pride!
-
- White pride!
If you're white, and you are standing over there...
- White freedom!

- White rights!
-
- White rights!
Nate!
Wake up, white people!

It's morning in America and there's a new day coming.

Come join the white race!

Racist scum!
Racist scum!
Racist bum!
It's the fucking afl.
Don't worry, they won't do shit.
Well, well, well, if it isn't the American fucking losers!
Yeah, fuck you!
Why don't you come over the fucking barricade, motherfuckers!
Johnny!
Hey, man, just fucking stay back, okay?
- Don't fucking do it.
- I gotta help him.
Help him by not getting the fuck arrested, okay?
- Fucking pussies!
-
- White Nazi scum!
Yeah, you know what?
I can do that shit, too.
I'm gonna fucking kill you, motherfucker!
- Do not engage.
Do not engage.
- You think I'm playing around?
I'm gonna fucking kill you!
Get your hands off of me!
I'm gonna kill these motherfuckers!
Stay back!
- White power!
-
- White pride!
- White power!
-
- White pride!
He hit me in the fucking eye!
It's fucking piss!
Johnny!
Andrew, can you walk?
Get the fuck outta here.
You okay?
Everyone okay?
Sorry.
Okay.
Stay with us.
I'm getting you out of here, man.
Go... go right, go right!
Oh, fuck!
- Fuck!
- Fucking...
Holy shit!
We gotta go!
We gotta fucking go!
I can't fucking go anywhere!
Stay down!
Fuck!
No, don't get up.
You need to rest.
I brought you some chamomile tea.
It'll help you relax.
Thank you.
There's our wounded warrior.
How you feeling, buddy?
Yeah, much better.
Thank you, guys.
Ah, no problem.
I'm gonna put some music on.
I brought you Sammy to keep you company.
Thanks.
Oh, wow.
You like it?
I...
I love brahms.
See, Becky, i knew he was quality.
I think the fourth is my favorite.
Yeah, mine, too.
Except maybe the-- the first?
Yeah.
Now listen, if you like brahms,
I've got this clarinet quintet that will blow your mind.
They're dead, Gerry.
Dead.
I'm gonna find them, and we're gonna string them up-- alright, I hear ya.
I hear ya.
That's why I avoid the political stuff.
Not my thing.
Besides, I've heard it can be dangerous.
That was fantastic.
Thank you...
I thought you guys were vegetarians.
Everybody's gotta have a few vices every now and then.
What's "vices"?
Oh, boy, there we go!
I'm sorry about that, that's my ride.
Gerry, Becky, thanks for everything.
Nathan, I don't know what to say.
I owe you, big time.
Why don't you stop by the compound some time.
Oh, I'm not really in Ohio that much, but I'd love to if I ever am.
No, I meant the...
The new one.
- Oh.
- Here in Virginia.
Oh, right, yeah, please, I'd love to.
- Bye.
- Have a good night.
Bye, Andrew!
Well, listen, you're not going to believe it, but when it comes to tchaikovsky...
Gotta go with Bernstein.
- Leonard Bernstein?
- I know, I know.
Gerry, I hate to break it to you, man--
I know.
Listen, I can't help it, he's a great conductor.
Jews listen to Wagner, don't they?
So, Gerry, if you don't mind my asking, how did you end up in the movement?
Listen, for me, it was the books.
My parents were practically liberals.
Totally blinded by the zog.
You know, I always knew something was wrong;
and I had this anger,
I couldn't put my finger on it, until here.
It all started with this.
I was 13.
Read it in four days.
It explains race, culture, capitalism and how democracy destroyed western civilization.
Democracy:
"Three people form a government.
Then two of them vote to steal the wealth of the third."
- David Lane, right?
- Mm-hm.
Now here's something more recent.
You'll love this.
This breaks down the entire worldwide zionist conspiracy, step by step.
- You can bring it back.
- Oh, no, I couldn't.
Nate, Nate, please.
But that was it?
I mean, it was just books woke you up?
Well, you know, i had my theories.
And then a three-month engineering contract opened up in Kenya.
I was young, i wanted to see the world.
And, uh, Nate, listen,
I got no problem with them having their own country, everybody should.
But if you go there, and you see, they weren't even living like animals.
You know, animals don't live in their own feces, do they?
So, if you ever have any doubt white men created civilization, just go have a look.
Hey.
So,howwasthe brahms?
Howdoyoureason withsomeonelikethat?
Howcanyoueverhope tochangetheirmind?
Listen,youneedtorememberwhyyou're doingthis.
We'renotsocialworkers.
Youwantedme to relate to them as human beings, right?
"Openupto them?"You said.
...theyweren'teven livinglikeanimals.
Youwantto getadrink?
Wherearewe gonnago andgetadrink?
This suspect, he was a fucking nightmare.
He was grabbing my ass, the whole thing.
And he kept insisting i go to this club with him, where I knew he was gonna make his big move, but if I didn't go, then, you know, I could blow my whole cover.
So what did you do?
So we're at a bar, and I tell him I want oysters.
So I get a dozen, i start plowing through them.
Then I start acting queasy.
I run to the bathroom, stick my finger down my throat.
- No way!
- Yeah!
So now there's puke all over my dress,
I tell him I got sick off the oysters and take a cab home.
Two days later, he was arrested.
- That is fucking awesome.
- Oh, it was fucked up.
But there was the thrill, you know?
That high.
God, there's nothing like it.
Yeah, so why'd you stop?
It was just it's no way to live, the paranoia, the tension.
And I wanted to spend more time with my kids.
You got kids?
You don't think I'm mommy material?
No, no... no.
Yeah, I got two princesses.
Mommy and daddy.
Perfect, little suburban life.
Anyway, I know how lonely this work can be.
But the case won't go forever.
You can't change the way people think, but you are making a difference.
Nathan, good to see you.
Can we get you anything, coffee?
Oh, no, I'm good, thanks.
This is a great set-up you got here.
Yeah, thanks.
All right, let's give you the tour.
This parcel is actually pretty small, but we're purchasing the one next to it.
Although, citizen's groups are trying to block us out.
Oh, yeah.
How are you handling that?
Well, we tell them we're here to stay.
Make no mistake about it.
We show up at their homes, their businesses, their churches.
They backed down pretty quick after that.
So you're moving the national headquarters?
No, we're keeping the compound in Ohio, it's just with everything going on right now, we needed a stronger presence here.
You know?
- Is that your firing range?
- Yeah, come on.
It's a little primitive, but we're working on it.
I'm no marksman, by any means, but I have some expertise in range design, just from training the Iraqi police.
What's your danger area template?
To contain your cone of fire.
I mean, how do you control your overshoot?
Uh...
We haven't gotten to that yet.
Okay, well, you might want to make sure it's the kikes and niggers getting hit and not your guys.
Absolutely.
Maybe if you have time,
- you could talk to the guys about it.
- Yeah, sure,
I need to see what kind of equipment you've got, but I'm happy to.
Okay.
Uh, come on up here.
Right now were just using this for storage.
- Are those cots?
- Yup.
We'll be able to sleep 200 in there.
And we're gonna need to.
I'm not gonna beat around the bush.
You see the type of organization we have here, but we could always use a man like you, Nathan.
Educated, war veteran, clean record.
I mean, hell, you don't even have any parking tickets.
Yeah, we have our contacts in law enforcement, local, state, federal, not to mention military hospitals, laboratories, you name it.
And so what's the overall objective here?
I mean, are you just trying to get the message out, or what?
Get the... get the message out?
To who?
We're not trying to recruit the public here.
What would we do with them?
They're at home sitting on their asses,
- watching sitcoms and surfing Facebook.
This is revolutionary activity we're talking about here.
Look, I'm flattered by the interest, but, you know,
I've been around the movement awhile now and a lot of these guys are all talk.
Now for me to really want to get involved,
I need to know there's bigger things going on here.
No offense.
Yeah... none taken.
All right...
Take a look at this.
This is the entire DC water system.
Plants, pipelines, the whole deal.
Now, Nathan, the guys you're hanging out with, they're all talk, because they're punks.
They're amateurs.
They sit around drinking beer all day, maybe they beat up a few niggers or each other.
We got no use for them.
We need men like you.
Can I help you?
I'm looking for Dallas wolf, but I must have the wrong house.
Oh, no, he's here.
Come in.
Randy!
Someone's here!
Hey, Nate.
The studio's back here.
I'm moving studios right now, so this is all temporary.
Oh, no, this is a great setup.
Thanks for taking the time to see me, Dallas.
I just spent the afternoon with Andrew at the Aryan alliance.
Oh, yeah?
Andrew's great.
They have an incredible organization.
Yeah, they seem really serious about the struggle.
About doing whatever it takes.
They're true patriots, those guys.
Well, let me give you a bit of background on me.
I was in Iraq for three years, on a wmd squad.
And then when I got back, my military contacts helped me set up a medical supply company.
V-a-l-e.
Wow, this is great.
Yeah, we do it all, from bandages and syringes to X-ray and radiotherapy equipment.
And with the highly regulated stuff, we can cut through a lot of the red tape and deal directly, and discreetly.
Fantastic, Nate.
Great to know.
So... you'd also mentioned an investment?
For the show?
Yes, I've got an investor lined up who's very excited about expanding your reach.
We're talking advertising, marketing, bigger servers...
That's exactly what I need.
So how do I meet him?
Well, a lot of my military contacts don't like to publicize their efforts.
But he'd love for you to put together a proposal about how you'd expand the show.
Funny you should mention that.
I've been trying to raise $7,500 to break into the Florida market.
They're ripe right now, with all the immigration stuff.
Yeah... yeah, this is great!
So, there's one more thing.
Go ahead, shoot.
The reason he's helping you is because he feels that you are a man of action, as he is.
As I am.
Right, sure.
So for him to move forward, he needs to know you're serious about this.
Nate, I've been ready to give my life for this cause for 20 years now.
What I need is the right people behind me.
So you tell your investor that if he wants action, he's got the right guy.
Um, sorry, Dallas, I've got kind of a long drive back, you mind if I hit the head?
The whole case is about to blow wide open!
He's in with wolf, he's in with the Aryan alliance.
Yeah, and all we need to keep wolf on the line is that $7,500!
Let me get this straight.
So after everything we spent on your cover, even after the medical supply business, you want me to ask for $7,500 asan"investment" inthisguy'sradioshow ?
You're the only one with a budget right now!
Oh, yeah, I'm just flush with cash!
I'm trying to run a 40-man investigation ontopof allthe shit I'vealreadygot!
Sir, the alliance is building a compound outside DC.
Wolf's house is setting off a geiger counter!
I spent six hours last night reading your transcripts,
Nate, you don't have shit!
Youdon'thaveshit!
Look at how much carbon is built up on this bolt.
- See?
See that?
Like-- - yeah.
That's unacceptable.
When's the last time you cleaned this?
I've been meaning to get to most of them.
Okay, guys, seriously!
Okay, so we got an ar-15, serial number a00724, needs a new buffer spring.
Come on, guys, let's go!
We need to go through the whole inventory.
Andrew's waiting on this.
I'm gonna have to tell Andrew, the only way it's gonna change is with new policies.
And how do I know it's not me you're trying to fuck?
Fuck you, you calling us liars?
You get on the phone yourself!
Call them up and ask them...
Hey, guys...
Hey, Nate...
It's been a while.
Yeah, you kinda disappeared on us.
I'm sorry about that, Vince.
I've been kind of busy.
Yeah, I bet you have.
Seems like you made a bunch of new friends around here, huh?
See, we were just wondering if maybe you could explain--
Roy!
Thanks for stopping by.
Be seeing you, Nate.
What was that all about?
Roy says the police have been following him.
He's paranoid about infiltrators.
Infiltrators, huh?
Yeah.
Mm.
That's why the police are on his ass?
Have you seen how that guy behaves?
It's a miracle he's not in jail already.
Right, uh, you want to help us with something?
Sure, what's up?
I'm throwing a youth event for Hitler's birthday.
There's a campground a couple miles from here.
- Help us scout it.
- Sounds good.
It's amazing how much land there is right outside DC.
Let me ask you something, Nathan.
What's your opinion on infiltration?
Well, how do you mean?
How do we prevent it?
Well, it's tough.
For one thing, you gotta keep guys with rap sheets out of important positions.
That's... that's how they flip most people.
We have a polygraph back at the compound.
Maybe we should make everybody take it.
I mean, i think someone who's trained can beat a polygraph without blinking.
Yeah, maybe we should just do a background checks for everybody.
Get everyone's records and documents together?
Yeah, I mean, for informants, that might work.
But for law enforcement, they just forge whatever they need.
Yeah, but with a few phone calls, you know, a cover only runs so deep.
Do you suspect someone?
You know, it's like they say at these rallies.
You look to the left, look to the right, one of these people is a snitch.
It's the left.
Turn left right up here.
You okay there, Nate?
You look a little off?
No, I'm good.
Just, uh, tired...
Been a long day.
Well, I think this is a great location.
What do you think?
Yeah, I like it.
Uh, well, what about the permits, though?
We tell them we're a Christian organization, holding a youth event.
I gotta ask you something.
Roy said he contacted the nprc.
Said there's no record of you having served in the marines.
You mean Roy went and filed a 180 with a government that he fucking hates, just to... okay.
I was on a wmd squad, so that's black ops.
And he knows that, the fucker.
Wait, hold on, are you guys taking this seriously?
Is that what that was all about in the truck?
Because, I understand you have to do your due diligence or whatever, but that's a fucking serious accusation!
I don't need to take that shit from anybody!
- Hey... hey, hey!
- Least of all from--
okay.
Let's get out of here.
Nate,listen.
Weneedtogettheserial numbers first,andthen- - no, look, I don't have time for that!
What if he wasn't convinced?
What if he calls wolf?
The account name is Nate foster, please.
You don't know if he was convinced!
You don't even know if they talk, okay?
You're being-- yeah, I'd like $7,500 in cash.
You're a man of your word, which is a rare thing in this movement.
So, listen, Dallas, my investor is very excited, but he wants to know some more about what you're planning, some details.
Oh, okay, I think it was all in the presentation, but we start with online in tampa, and then we move down the- no, no, I mean, beyond that.
- Beyond Florida?
Beyond the show, like what we talked about.
The actions we're gonna take.
I'm sorry, Nate.
I lost you.
What do you mean?
What I mean is, you have been talking a lot about a lot of big things that are coming.
Bigger than Oklahoma city, bigger than 9/11-- oh, yeah, for sure.
Which is why expanding the show is so important.
Right, and I have been spending a lot of time with Andrew at the Aryan alliance.
He told me you'd been working together.
Well, yeah, sure, i mean, he came to the rally.
No, no, what my investor needs to know is what are the concrete steps that you are taking to start the race war.
As I said to you before,
I have the expertise, the connections, the tools.
Maybe there's some kind of misunderstanding.
I thought we were talking about expanding the show.
Yeah, which my investor is happy to do, but if you're not willing to be honest about the other actions you're taking, then he's not gonna be able to support you.
Okay, Nate, fair enough.
Sorry it didn't work out.
I saw the plans, Dallas, for the water system.
Andrew showed them to me, okay?
So, I know all about it, and now I just need you to stop pretending and be honest with me.
This is private property.
You're no longer welcome here.
I'm asking you to leave.
Come on, Dallas.
I'm on your side.
Get the fuck out.
Now.
Fuck.
We'regoingto theoffice,
Dallaswolfis there.
Youbroughthimin?
No.
Hecametous.
Sir.
I didn't know you'd be here.
Has anyone talked to him?
No, no, of course not.
No, it's your show.
So, Dallas.
Or should I call you Randy?
That is your real name.
You can call me whatever you like, agent zamparo.
Any reason you're using an assumed name?
I'm a public entertainer.
Ah... fine.
So, tell me why you're here today.
I'm here because of the guy I called about.
He shows up at my conference, talking about investing in my show.
Butthen,he 'stellingme howhecanget highlyregulateditems.

Right.
Let me play you something, okay, Randy.
Ihaveinformation abouta truckaccident outsideDClastnight, involvingclassified radioactivematerial, butnowtheFBI istrying tocoverit allup.
Why ?
You've gotta be kidding me.
It's a radio show.
It's entertainment!
So you think it's entertaining to predict and incite terrorist attacks?
Whether I think it's entertaining is irrelevant.
Why don't you talk to somebody around here who knows something about the law, preferably a man!
Brandenburgvs.Ohio,1969, itisnotillegal toadvocateviolence.
Thefirstamendment doesn't protect people who have knowledgeofan actualcrime!
What knowledge of a crime do I have?
Well, why don't you tell me, Randy?
What is this accident?
What is this FBI cover-up?
Why are you living at an unregistered address?
And why is that location lighting up a geiger counter?
You've been following me?
You've been casing my house?
Why don't you answer my questions?
Letmeshowyou something.

- Now, tom, look, what?
Really, what could you possibly have to say?
Because this is a fucking disaster!
I warned you, i tried to tell you.
- We still might have a weapons case!
- We ran those serial numbers.
Every single one of those guns is legally registered.
Every one!
Okay, so you think there's nothing to any of this?
Right?
The prepaid cellphones?
The barracks for 200 guys?
- The water system plans?
- They're conspiracy theorists!
It's all talk!
He keeps those plans around to trot out when he wants to act like a big shot!
What are they gonna do, they're gonna put radioactive material in the water supply?
That doesn't make any fucking sense!
You two, you pull this from here and that from there, and you're making up this whole big fucking story in your head, and it's bullshit!
You know, we see what we want to see!
Well, now you've compromised him, and you've compromised the bureau, and you've wasted all our fucking time!
This happens sometimes, you know?
- I mean, it sucks, but-- - "this happens"?
Is that all you're gonna fucking say after we find out all of this?
Everything you fucking put me through has been for nothing?
It's the nature of the work.
No!
This... this happened because of your pet theory!
And like an idiot, i went along with it!
"Oh, yeah, she's an expert," i thought.
"She knows what she's doing!"
I'm sorry, Nate.
Fucking why?
Why are you even sorry?
This has been great for you!
You got the thrill back!
You got the excitement you've been wanting, you got an escape from your little suburban life,
- by manipulating me!
- No, that is not fair!
I thought we had a case!
God, do you even know how many dead ends I've been down?
No, you fucking knew!
You knew I was so eager, so desperate to do something meaningful, to actually work on a real case in this place, that I would do anything you wanted, while you just sat back and enjoyed the ride!
Yeah.
Fuck!
Nate!
Hey, good to see you!
I've been calling you!
Yeah, I know, I'm sorry about that, I've been really busy.
I just wanted to return these.
I'm heading out of town for a couple of months, gonna work on setting up the business on the west coast.
Oh, wow, wow, well, please come in.
Uh, that's nice of you, but I don't think I can.
Aw, come on, just for a cup of tea?
Is everything okay, Nate?
Yeah, yeah, why do you ask?
Well, you said you're headed out west.
Yeah, I'm gonna work on setting up the business on the west coast.
Right.
God, it's hard to find what we're looking for in life.
But then, I listen to something like that.
One man made something...
That will make millions, maybe billions of people feel the way we just did.
We all have that power, Nate.
All of us.
Honestly...
I used to feel that way, Gerry.
I always felt like i could change the world.
You know, I could right wrongs, you know, fight injustice.
Nate, listen, it's guys like us that feel these things the most.
Idealists.
Yeah, I just keep thinking about that quote.
"For evil to triumph, it only takes good men to do nothing."
But how?
You know, fucking how?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Gerry, i shouldn't be...
- It's all right.
- I'm just really tired.
You know, Nate, maybe you're going about this the wrong way.
The rallies, the speeches, the politics...
That's not how the change is gonna come.
It's gonna come from the unknown soldiers, from the leaderless resistance.
How do you mean?
Let's go out back.
I made some improvements to the tree house.
Talking frankly is something we have to be very careful about.
- Something we always do outdoors.
- Right, of course.
You know, I've thinking about this for a long time, Nate, years really.
What's needed is an event.
What kind of event?
An event that wakes people up.
They're sleepwalkers out there.
They're blind.
Think about this regime.
Media brainwashing, secret courts, mass surveillance, waco, Ruby Ridge.
Using Katrina and 9/11 to set up "refugee camps," or "detention camps", in other words, concentration camps, because who cares about the rights of a few arabs, niggers and racists, if it makes us safer?
Right?
That's how it all starts.
All the lies that the zionists tell about Nazi Germany, that's what's actually happening right now!
The irony of it!
Right?
That's why we gotta be smart.
That's why the event has to force the zog to show its hand.
It's gotta reveal the men behind the curtain.
Because it's not the event that wakes people up, it's the reaction to the event.
Yes!
Yes, you get it!
Yeah, look at the sons of Liberty.
Look at the ira.
That is how you start a revolution.
Yeah, yeah, I always felt this kinship with you, Nate.
And...
I wanted to talk openly with you, but I just haven't known you that long, but I know in my heart, i can trust you.
You can.
You can, Gerry, i want to help.
I want to make a difference.
Okay.
I still got connections from my Africa days.
Okay, and we have the means to create that kind of event.
But, Nate, if you get involved we may not live to see the world we're building.
But I'll have helped to build it.
A man's body dies, but his deeds live forever.
There's a way you can help us.
- Okay, yeah.
- Come here.
We need to talk to the s.A.C., now!
Oh, my lord, who the hell wrapped it?
You guys aren't trying to give it a bath!
Oh, hey, guys!
Sorry abut that, just having some technical difficulties over here.
- No problem!
- Be right over...
- Okay, one, two...
- Hey, Morgan, David...
I want you to meet somebody.
This is Nate.
Morgan, good to meet you.
- Greetings, sir.
I'm David.
- Hey, you guys.
So is the wedding out here?
Yeah, it's right over here.
It's beautiful, isn't it?
Wait till we see it all lit up.
Pure of spirit and pure of race, these two souls commit themselves to the defense and prosperity of their sacred blood.
May their sons and daughters fill this land, forever honoring their duty to folk, kindred, soil, and honor.
Iknowyouguys don'tknowNatethatwell .
But he's a good man and he's a good soldier.
If you trust me, you can trust him.
No luck yet.
No one wants to sell to an anonymous buyer.
If we give up that prepaid phone crap, i use my real name,
I got three guys i can get it from right now.
If we do it the morning of-- yeah, I thought we were at least trying to do this without getting caught?
Guys, guys, shh.
Nate has a potential solution for us.
Tatp.
It's much better than ammonium nitrate anyway.
A smaller quantity will give you a much bigger blast.
Yeah, well, sure, but where are we gonna get that?
I run a medical supply company.
And you're gonna get tatp?
I know it's not the easiest thing, but I've got some connections.
I can make a few calls and loop back with Gerry.
Assuming I can, what are we gonna do about the cesium powder itself?
Ready when we need it.
No, I mean, how are we going to handle it?
Well we've got heavy gloves, and we've got goggles.
No... radioactive particles will pass through those as easy as anything else, including your skin.
- Well, what do you suggest?
- I think we need suits.
They'll be pretty bulky, but we only need to wear them when the powder's out in the open.
When do we need them by?
Well, we've just been waiting for the explosive.
If you can get the tatp, Sunday is our day.
You guys remember Timothy McVeigh's last words?
Yeah, he read invictus.
"It matters not how strait the gait, how charged with punishments the scroll,
I am the master of my fate:
I am the captain of my soul."
Are you sure this is gonna look right?
Wow.
It looks great.
The secret is the smell.
Where's the bleach powder?
Oh, it's right over here.
And you're sure they're not gonna try and test this somehow?
Yeah, that's why terrorists love tatp.
You can't identify it without a mass spectrometer.
Okay, if you say so.
Yeah.
Uh-huh, yeah, I'm here now.
Sunday, so team's in place Friday night.
Look, can I just say
I'm sorry about what i said to you the other day.
I was exhausted.
Don't worry about it.
That's what this job does to you.
Keep at it another ten years and you'll turn into a real asshole...
like me.
It's totally secure.
We can keep everything in here, and then, on game day, we can use this space to put it all together.
Great, great.
This is great, Nate.
And here is the tatp.
- No problems, inquiries?
- Nope.
All good.
Morgan's a pharmacist.
All right.
Hm, these crystals seem a little small.
Smells about right.
Okay, let's test it.
Test it?
You got a mass spectrometer in your bag?
No, we'll just see if it burns.
What?
No, whoa, whoa!
Hold on, what do you mean?
Burn it?
What are you talking about?
Well, we use a sample, we set it a light.
It burns for a while before it explodes.
I saw it on YouTube.
Are you insane?
Do you know how dangerous this stuff is?
Hey, you are not the only one with experience!
This is a highly unstable substance, okay?
It's sensitive to heat, friction-- which is why I'll do the test carefully!
Now you want to see the video?
Because I have it here on my phone!
I don't give a shit about what's on your phone!
We are not lighting this stuff on fire!
You know how many bomb techs i saw get their faces blown off trying to deal with this stuff in Iraq?
I've worked with this company for two years!
They are not gonna send me a container full of baking soda, okay?
Gerry, this doesn't work for me, okay, if he doesn't trust me, or my suppliers-- we need to test the fucking stuff!
You don't fucking trust me or my suppliers, that is your problem!
You want to use ammonium nitrate, fine with me!
- Okay.
- Fine with me.
Nate, Nate, Nate.
It's all right.
It's fine, it's fine.
Morgan, Morgan, he's right.
Come on.
He's right.
So, can we see the suits?
And it's kind of hard with the gloves, but... and you zip that up and fasten along there.
You guys, what would be worse, radiation poisoning or wearing this thing around for a couple hours?
Yeah.
Soifyoueverhave anydoubt white men created civilization, justgohavealook .
Howdoyoureason withsomeonelikethat?
Howcanyoueverhope tochangetheirmind?
Hello?
Hey, hey, listen, something's wrong.
David drove to Frederick county earlythismorning andwentto afarmsupply.
Itlookslikehebought ammoniumnitrate.
And now they're all at Gerry's.
But it's Saturday?
And why do they need ammonium nitrate?
I don't know.
Me and Hernandez are heading over to meet the surveillance team at Gerry's now.
- What are you going to do?
- I don't know!
No!
No!
You can not raid them yet!
You don't even know if they have the cesium?
And Gerry's phone's off.
Okay, I have to go over there.
No,Nate!
It--
- What are you doing here?
- I was calling, you didn't answer.
I got worried.
- Bullshit!
Why are you here?
- I just told you!
I'm gonna give you one more chance.
Okay, what the fuck is wrong with this guy?
I called three times, you didn't answer any of them!
I got worried something happened to you!
All right, put it down!
He's telling the truth!
- Were you followed?
-
- No, I wasn't!
- Are you sure?
- Yes!
I was worried, so I was checking constantly!
Okay, calm down, everybody calm down.
Okay, can somebody tell me what is going on?
I sent David to do surveillance on your shop last night.
I saw an electrical crew go into the building across the street.
- So?
- In the middle of the night?
Could there be like a power problem?
No, they must have traced the tatp you ordered.
- Okay, if they're on to the shop...
- Fuck.
...they're on to you.
Are you sure you weren't followed?
- Yes!
- If he said he wasn't, he wasn't!
Stay calm and keep your eyes open.
Morgan, get back to work, please, Jesus.
We had to move forward, immediately.
It would have been only a matter of time before they were on to us, too.
And you weren't gonna let me know?
Nate, I'm sorry.
It's too risky.
Well, he's here now, let's get him to help!
What about the tatp?
David got ammonium nitrate instead.
He used his name, so the jig is up.
They'll know it's us.
It's not gonna matter tomorrow.
We're in this to the end now, Nate.
Do you understand?
They're not gonna take us alive.
All right, let me help.
Okay, okay, good.
Come over here.
I should go wash up so I don't contaminate anything.
Oh...
Hey, Nate!
How are you?
- Nate!
- The cesium is here!
All right, everyone!
Let's get ready to do this!
No!
Angela, you have to tell him to wait.
Wait?
No, no, no, we need to get in there now!
There are three guys in there with machine guns and they're building a bomb.
This is a residential neighborhood.
His wife and kids are in the house.
Ifyoucomeinhere now, it'llbeabloodbath .
This is a volatile situation.
Yeah, which is why we need to move now...
No, he doesn't get it!
These guys are fanatics!
They will not be taken alive!
Tom, you're not in there!
We have to listen to him.
And what the fuck happens if the explosives go off whilewe'rewaitingaround?
Nate,yougot60seconds todisarmthoseguys, becausewe'recomingin.
Okay, let's get these suits ready.
Okay, let's get ready to move!
We are almost done here!
Fuck!
The cesium spilled!
Shit, get the suits on!
Go, go, go!
Come on!
Come on, help me!
Help me!
Get zipped up!
Get zipped up!
Son of a...
Shit, come on!
- Come on, get your hood on!
- No!
No!
...stop!
Get the gun!
It's me!
It's me!
It's me!
Are you okay?
You all right?
- You all right?
- Yeah, no, I'm good, I'm good.
I know my rights!
I'm a patriot of the United States!
- Shut your fucking mouth!
- Fuck you!
Come on, get up!
Surprise!
Thepaperworkcamein...
Houston.
Yeah...
Texas.
Can you believe it?
Good margaritas, I hear.
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm gonna miss it here, though.
Well, "it's" going to miss you, too.
"This should have been a noble creature;
he hath all the energy which would have made a goodly frame of glorious elements, had they been wisely mingled."
Gerry?
Yeah, Gerry, and all of them, really.
Yeah, that's why you were the right guy for the job.
What do you mean?
Why do you think I picked you?
I knew that you would understand them.
And they'd understand you.
And the more authentic you became with them, the more authentic they'd become with you.
Because when it comes down to it, there really is only one essential ingredient to fascism.
It'svictimhood.
I blamed those black kids, and I blamed this school,
I blamed the cops;
I blamed everybody.
I was gonna hurt everyone else the way they hurt me.
I look at you guys and I see myself.
But you guys don't have to make the same mistakes I did.
You don't have to be victims.
Hey.
- Hey.
- Hey.
That was great.
Thanks.
Dude, thanks...
Thanks for coming by.
I'm so proud of you, Johnny.
You know what they say...
It all begins with the word.
You have the phone?
ShouldI doit now?
Notyet.
Waituntil wegetto thecheckpoint.
Okay, guys, this is it.
Hey, Ivy league's gun, put that gun back away.
- What are you talking about?
- I don't need some egghead who just scored an 81 on his qual shooting my dick off, okay?
This is my fucking guy!
I'm not just gonna sit here while you-- guys, enough!
Nate, just follow our lead, okay?
Is your heart clear?
Areyousure youwantto do this?
The signal will be better outside.
Here it is.
Did it work?
- Drop it!
- Freeze!
- Hands in the air!
- Turn around!
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
You have the right to an attorney.

Oh, wow, he's a real prince, this one.
Can I get in there?
Salam aleikum.
What the fuck, tom?
I have this room at 4:00!
I know you don't get a lot of news downstairs, Zamparo, but we just broke up a massive terrorist plot, all right?
Try and keep up.
Um...
What?
What is it?
Sir, when I flagged up this guy's email,
I thought the investigation was only gonna proceed if there was substantive criminal evidence to back it up.
We've got hours of him talking about waging jihad and killing children.
Right, but talking, though, sir, not... he's not doing anything.
Isn't that the point?
Hey, Tim.
How's it going?
You celebrating something, Nate?
You seeing someone special, huh?
Uh, yeah, actually.
How'd you guess?
Genius, emergency meeting in the conference room!
The crash was off 301 around 2:00 last night.
Local police controlled the scene, so, thankfully, the press knows nothing.
These containers carried cesium-137.
It's used for radiotherapy applications in hospitals, but it's highly regulated and had no business being on that truck.
When we tracked the shipment back to Baltimore, the customs record showed eight containers, not two.
So there's six more of them out there, all of them in the country illegally.
If that quantity made it's way into a radiological device, we could be looking at thousands of casualties, mass evacuations and radioactive contamination throughout the D.C. area.
- Tom?
- Yeah.
Uh, lab analysis puts the cesium coming from north Africa.
So the guys on four, they put together this map.
It's an analysis of Muslim communities in DC, Maryland and Virginia, along with their countries of origin.
We'd like each-- yes?
What about leads on the dt front?
Well, given the cesium came from north Africa, we don't think domestic is really in the picture.
The last time anyone tried to build a dirty bomb on us soil was James cummings.
He was a white supremacist living in Maine, he was going to set it off at Obama's inauguration.
He had uranium, thorium, and he was trying to acquire cesium.
I'm sure you're familiar with the case.
It goes without saying, anyone here is welcome to pursue any leads they think are fruitful.
Okay, would you fucking stop--
- Oh, I'm so sorry.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- I'm Angela Zamparo.
- Nate Foster.
- I know.
You got a couple minutes?
Dt's downstairs.
There's only one perk to being down in this shithole.
Nicorette just isn't the same.
So, Nate...
You seem like you've got a bit more going on than most around here.
You remember Oklahoma City?
Well, yeah, i guess I was five, but sure.
What do you know about Timothy McVeigh?
Ah... he was some kind of lone extremist in a militia?
Don't be an asshole who bullshits questions you don't know the answer to.
Here.
Timothy McVeigh was a decorated Gulf war veteran.
He was not insane;
He was not a lunatic;
And he was not stupid.
He was a white supremacist, following a plan.
- What plan?
- A plan from a book called the Turner diaries.
It's about a "race war" to exterminate blacks, Jews, and "mud people."
You know how the war gets started?
The hero drives a truck bomb into a federal building.
Timothy McVeigh was reenacting that scene from the Turner diaries.
He was carrying the book with him when he was arrested.
What he was trying to do was start the race war.
You're focused on the islamic guys.
I get it.
We all create a narrative based on what we think is important.
We see what we want to see.
But just because you're not looking at something doesn't mean it's not there.
So, why are you telling me this?
I'mtalkingaboutabloodandguts,in thestreet,killorbekilledracewar.
Ihaveinformationaboutatruck accidentoutsideDC lastnight, involvingclassified radioactivematerial.
ButnowtheFBI istrying tocoverit allup.
Why ?
Becausesomething bigishappening, andit'sbiggerthan9/11 ,and it'sbiggerthanOklahomaCity .
Sobewarned, bearmed,andbeready.
His name is Dallas Wolf.
He gets 20,000 listeners a night.
We believe he's based just outside of DC, but almost nobody knows him personally.
But I have an informant, a skinhead in a gang.
And the leader of that gang is friends with Wolf.
So I need someone to get in there, and get close to him.
Right and I'm trying to tell you that this is not my thing!
I barely passed the pft!
What do you think undercover work is?
Beating guys up and shooting at them?
No, it's people skills.
It's controlling situations.
- It's this.
- Seriously?
This is the only undercover training you'll ever need.
I saw you with that Muslim kid.
You got most of this going on anyway.
Look, I read your file.
High IQ, great people skills, but not your typical FBI profile.
Introverted, an outsider, unhappy childhood.
Single mother, always moving around a lot, always the new kid, bullied at school, no close friends or-- okay, okay, okay, fuck you!
That's... this is an invasion.
What gives you the right to look-- because we don't have time to dick around here!
You don't smuggle a boatload of cesium into the country and then just let it fucking sit there!
Fine, but I'm trying to tell you,
I don't have the skills for this!
I can't even defend myself!
You do have the skills, and they mean you will never have to!
What did you say to that kid?
"You want to change things, so nobody has to suffer the way you did."

Are you out of your fucking mind?
Do you know how management looks at undercover, Nate?
You think this office is bad?
They'll have you chasing pedophiles on an Indian reservation.
I just want to discuss the option, sir.
Discuss the option?
Of what, of killing your whole career?

Oh, shut the fuck up!
Oh, what, so you want him to go in blind, so he has no idea what he's getting into?
You're just trying to manipulate him!
And you're not?
You do whatever the fuck you want.

I was up all night Photoshop-ing it, so if anyone wants to see proof of my service in the marines, they can just-- what the fuck are you doing?
No, no, no, no.

So what do they want from you?
My loyalty?
I'm loyal, I'm dedicated to the the cause.
No.
Any thug can be loyal.
What do you have...
What the guys with the cesium... are gonna want?
Welcome to Medvale medical supply company.
My military contacts helped me start this business.
Most of our sales are online.
Our radiotherapy products are specifically designed for the handling and storing of radioactive material.
So we can acquire sensitive materials and hide them.
Hisnameis FrankHedges.
He'sbeenaCIfortwoyears.
He's in a gang called the panzer strikeforce, and the leader of the gang is this guy.
Vince sargent.
He's friends with Dallas Wolf.
So Vince and Dallas Wolf are tight?
Yeah, I told you, Vince calls into Wolf's show every week.

Then,youusehim togetto knowWolf.
This is my friend Nate i was telling you about.
Hey, everybody.
14/88, brother.
Good to meet you.
All right, spread 'em.
Roy does our security.
Okay, fine.
Whoa, whoa, hey, what the fuck is that?
- What's what?
- That!
Under your fucking shirt there!
What is that?
Hey, are you a cop?
Hey, look me in my fucking eyes, boy!
Are you a fucking cop?
- No, I'm not.
- No?
Whoo!
He's fine.
Sorry about that, Nate.
But you know how it is.
- Yeah, absolutely.
- Whoa, whoa.
Have a seat.
You drink bud?
Uh, yeah, absolutely.
Frank tells me you were in Iraq.
Uh, yeah, three years in the corps.
- You kill anybody?
- Johnny!
He's Johnny.
He's a fresh cut.
We're trying to teach him the ropes.
I know the fuckin' ropes, man.
Yeah, then mind your fucking manners!
So, did you?
Kill anybody?
I don't talk about that.
But what I did see was a lot of our guys go down.
Good guys... friends.
And for what?
I was on a wmd squad, the whole reason we were there, except we didn't find shit, did we?
Hmm.
So then I get home, I started listening to Dallas Wolf.
Oh, yeah?
Dallas and I go way back.
Oh, there's a guy I'd love to meet, you know.
He's somebody who's telling the truth.
He's out there, he's asking why were we there?
And the answer's always the same.
Iraq, 9/11, Osama bin Laden, what does it all come back to?
Look at every war we've ever been in.
How many white men slaughtered their brothers in World War II?
What, like a 100 million?
And for who?
Who's always pulling the strings?
It's all here in front of us.
But most people are blind.
Look at this bottle.
You see anything funny?
You're talking about the Jew tax?
What's the Jew tax?
Tell 'em, Nate.
Start looking at the food you buy, and you'll see this little "u."
The union of orthodox rabbis gets paid to perform a "blessing" on everything in the grocery store.
For this "blessing," they rake in billions of dollars in taxes.
We can't control the ketchup, but we can control the streets.
That's how it went down in Germany.
And we think of ourselves as a Sturmabteilung.
We are a thinking man's soldiers.
First here.
And then here.
And that is where the revolution starts.
We're not these tired old KKK guys, waiting for some catastrophe to start a race war.
- We're the catastrophe.
- That's fucking right.
And we need guys like you, with military backgrounds.
We need best practices in our security.
Come on, man, I think our fucking security is pretty good.
Well, always room to improve, though, right?
Oh, yeah?
Like what?
Well, like, look at the position of this booth and then tell me, without looking, where the nearest exits are.
- What's your point?
- The point is, of all the large booths in this restaurant, you picked the one farthest from the exits.
If something goes down, we're fucked.
No, we're ready for whatever goes down.
Yeah, with only you and him, I don't know your name yet, I'm sorry, carrying?
Oh, and how the fuck you think you know that?
When you pat someone down so they're facing everybody's lap, it's pretty easy to tell.
You spend three years in Iraq, you learn how to scan a room.
And see threats.
Well, isn't that fucking impressive.
Now I only got one question for you.
What?
Why are you wearing Levis?
Levis?
Your fucking Jew jeans?
Yeah, no, sorry, i just couldn't help notice when I was patting' you down.
While you were doing your little detective work all up in everybody's lap.
So why are you wearing them?
Because when i got home from Iraq, my brother gave me these jeans... as a homecoming gift.
Now, does he understand the struggle we're in?
No.
But I'm sure as shit not gonna let a zionist conglomerate keep me from wearing them.
You wanna boycott the Jews?
You ever look at the fortune 500?
You'll be living in a fucking cave.
He's right.
Shit, they probably own this place, too.
Frank tells me you run a medical supply company now?
Yeah.
Yeah, my military contacts helped me set up.
We're just starting out, but we got access to a lot of stuff.
That's great.
I'd love to talk to you about that sometime.
Yeah... anytime.
You know, when I was 13, i actually played soccer.
One day, I came into the locker room, right?
And there were these six niggers, and they had this friend of mine, this Irish kid, down in the stalls, right?
His head was up against the toilet, and his face was just covered,
I mean, covered in blood, like flaps of skin.
I'd never seen anyone get beaten like that.
And when I came in, they just stared at me.
They stared, and I...
I walked away...
And just left him.
I hated those motherfuckers.
Yeah, when I was your age, i got pushed around a lot.
- Yeah?
- It fucking sucks.
But you can use that.
Yeah, but with these guys, nobody can do shit to me.
I learned to be proud.
Strong!
- Yeah, but-- - to be an Aryan fucking warrior!
Isn't that right, Johnny?
All right, so what, are we gonna stand around all night
- or we gonna get fucking drunk!
- Let's go!
Come on, junior, let's get some fucking beer, motherfucker!
Come on, boy!
Get in there, boy!

What's wrong?
Oh, yeah, no, we know where you live.
- Yup.
- Right.
Cool.
Yeah, so, what, you're not gonna invite us in?
Yeah, come on in.
Oh, thanks, man, so sweet of you.
It's a mess, sorry.
Welcome.
You mind?
Yeah, it's a cool place, man.
Yeah, but it kind of looks like you just moved in.
So, what are you guys doing here?
Aw, don't break my heart.
What are we doing here?
Come on, don't make it sound like you're not happy to see me.
See Vince is outside.
He's got a little surprise for you.
Oh, hey, well, um...
Yeah, well, I'm ready.
Let's go.
You're gonna be psyched, man!
It's fucking awesome!
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Cool, well, I'm good to go.
Let's head out.
- Let's go, Roy.
- What's the rush?
I'm coming.
What the fuck?
What the fuck is that?
Goddamn, man, you got some fucking shitty-ass furniture up in here, huh?
Yep.
Cheap as shit.

Sieg Heil, motherfucker, let's go.
Sieg fucking Heil.

You make him look small, you make him into an enemy.
Sometimes, Angela, it would just be great to hear, "good job."
I'm only so hard on you because I'm trying to protect you.
You have to remember your objective here.
This is about getting to Dallas Wolf.
So what do I do about that?
Try relating to these guys as human beings.
You know?
Open up to them, if you can.
You may have more in common with them than you think.
Man, why the fuck does Vince make us come to this shit?
"Good networking, lots of movement guys." I mean, who gives a fuck?
Well, is Dallas Wolf gonna be here?
Who the fuck knows?
I don't listen to that talk radio bullshit.
Fuck!
Goddamn.
Hey, that looks good on you, man.
Yeah, thanks.
Um, just go in,
I got another shirt in the cargo.
Hi, you must be Vince's friend Nate!
- I'm Becky, Gerry's wife.
- Oh, hi, nice to meet you.
- Such a pleasure to have you.
- Thank you for having me.
Yeah, of course.
Hey, Nate, i made some cupcakes.
The frosting is a little messed up, but they taste good.
So,Dallas,we wanted...
Nate!
Come check this out.

Because while we come in peace, we'recertainly notafraidof war.
Fuck.
Yeah.
God, that's the first I'm hearing about this rally.
I mean, god knows you can't get any real news on the Yi Division, but still...
Are you planning on going, Nathan?
And this is Andrew Blackwell from the Aryan Alliance.
- Hail victory, brother.
- Hail victory.
The Aryan Alliance, huh?
I've read a lot about you guys.
Well, we're the premiere white nationalist group in the world, so that's not surprising.
Ernest Walton, grand dragon, good to meet you.
Good to meet you.
Ernest is with the local klan.
Yeah, you should stop by one of our meetings.
- We'd love to have you.
-
- Oh, wow.
You should check out our website, too.
We're always looking for quality people.
Ah, I don't think Nate's into all that religious stuff.
Excuse me?
Religious stuff?
I just think Nate is a little more rational than that.
I'm not sure I know what you mean by that.
Come on, Nate.
Let's go back and get some food.
Stay away from those faggots.
They got this fucked up religion where they think the Bible was written for white men and aryans are the lost tribes of Israel.
The Bible.
Jews invented christianity.
Jews invented the printing press, and the Bible is the most published book in the world.
I mean, anything seem off to you?
How about the fact the romans conquered every mud race on earth, and then christianity finished them off in a hundred years?
You gotta know who to stick with in this movement.
You're with us.
Goddamn it, Vince, every time we come here, the whole fuckin' place is dry!
- What the fuck, man?
- It's two hours, be good.
Gerry, there's somebody I want you to meet.
This is Nate.
- Hey, Gerry Conway.
- Nate Thomas, nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.
Vince told me all about you.
Make yourself at home.
I am throwing on some veggie burgers.
Thanks for having us.
- Hi!
- Hey, hey, I'm Nate.
- Madeline.
Nice to meet you.
- Hey, Madeline.
- This is Timmy.
- Hey, Timmy.
You want to come see our tree house?
Uh, yeah, sure, where are we going?
Oh, right, yeah, there.
Oh, wow, that is great!
Did your dad build this?
- I built it!
- You built this?
- But my daddy helped.
- Okay.
Wow.
- It's to protect us.
- Yeah, from what?
If the mud people come.
Always be ready.
Always be watchful and stick together.
You guys kidnapping my guest?
- Huh?
Huh?
This is amazing, man.
Well, I've always been good with my hands.
And it was just wonderful to have a project with the kids.
You know how you spell love, Nate?
T-i-m-e.
Ninety percent of the time you'll ever spend with your kids
- comes before the age of 12.
- Wow.
Yeah.
You been in the movement long, Nate?
Um, not long.
Just since i got back from Iraq.
Oh, yeah, right.
Yeah, Vince told me you served.
- Mm-hm.
- Mm-hm.
Hey, Nate, don't take this the wrong way but you kind of seem a little mature for a skinhead.
Really?
Yeah.
Yeah, maybe.
I don't know.
Um, what about you?
You seem to know a lot of people in this movement.
Ah, they probably come for the free food.
Ah, no.
You have these barbecues often?
Yeah, as much as I can, yes, you know,
I try to create a positive environment for everybody in the community, and a place for us to come together and be healthy in body and spirit.
"Fuck you, bitch!" And he turned around, and he's like-- guys!
Guys!
Language, please.
Kids.
Jesus fucking Christ.
It makes me so sad to see those two.
They gotta clean up their act.
Well, how do you mean?
Well, the cigarettes, and alcohol, the language.
This is what's happening to our young Aryan men.
Yeah.
To be honest, now that I met you,
I'm kind of surprised you invited those guys.
Well, you can't exclude them.
I mean, they're the next generation.
They need our help.
Need to understand their heritage, and be proud of it.
That's what it's all about, isn't it?
The children.
What kind of a world will they grow up in?
Goddamn, man, that was the worst fucking party on earth.
Jesus Christ, what kind of bullshit vodka is this, man?
Man, that's the last time i ever let you pick it out.
Man, look at that shit.
Look at that!
That is just fucking...
God, that is so fucking awful!
Man, look at that, look at that beautiful Aryan woman and that fucking...
Roy, come on, let's go the fuck home.
No, no, man, we're gonna teach these two a lesson.
- No!
- Get your fucking hands off of me!
Don't you ever fucking touch me again.
You hear me?
We're Aryan Warriors, right?
That means we got a responsibility to do something about shit like this.
Hey, you two!
You need to get the fuck out of here!
Hold on, what did you say?
I said, get the fuck out of here or we're gonna kill you, you fucking spic!
What the fuck is your problem?
- What's our problem?
-
- Yeah.
You come into our country, you fuck our women.
Yeah, you got some big fucking balls, huh?
- Put the fucking knife down and calm down, all right, man?
- Oh, my god!
They get the point.
You thought you were a big man, huh?
He gets it, Roy!
He's fucking shaking.
I thought you were a big man.
- Put the fucking knife down!
- Fuck you, motherfucker!
I'll fucking gut you, you piece of shit!
Now go, fucker!
- Come on, let's go!
- Shit!
Fuck, Nate.
Goddamn it!
You're fucking lucky!
What the fuck is your problem?
You fucked the whole thing up!
Yeah, I think they got the message, Roy!
Got the message?
Are you a fucking idiot?
Man, those two were mine!
And then your dumb fucking ass decides...
Hang on, wait a minute...
First you tried to stop me, then you try to scare them off, and then you set off that fucking alarm.
That wasn't an accident, was it?
Was it, Nate?
You wanted them to get away.
What the fuck, Nate?
Huh?
I said what the fuck?
Okay, you're goddamn right i wanted them to get away!
You want to be a soldier, Roy and not a fucking thug?
Then think!
You think about security cameras, Roy?
You think about the liquor store we were just in?
You think about the clerk or the license plates on my fucking truck?
You think about any of that shit?
Fucking Aryan Warrior...
A hundred spics and niggers ain't worth the life of one white man, but go ahead, put us all in prison.
That's how you're gonna win your race war?
Huh?
Fuck!
All right, whatever, can we just get back on the road and get the fuck out of here?
Fuck!
Iranthoselicenseplates.
Anaccountant,aschool teacher,a lawyer,fireman, he'sanengineer, not a criminal record in sight, butAndrewBlackwell, he'sa differentstory.
Whyishe here?
Uh, he said he was going to Wolf's rally.
He's the national director of the Aryan Alliance.
They're based in Ohio, he wouldn't just come all this way to be in a rally.
Wait, if Wolf is involved in this, he can't be doing it alone, right?
I mean, he'd need help, and organization.
Exactly, so you need to figure out how Wolf and Blackwell are connected, and why he's really here.
Vince, good to see you.
Rich, can we get some literature, please?
- White power.
- White power.
Okay, we're gettin' ready to get started here.
Can everyone take a seat?

If you take millions of white people, and flood every country in Africa with them, what do they call that?
Genocide.
But what's happening to every white country on earth?
You've got affirmative action that kills white jobs.
Abortion, that kills white babies.
Gay rights, that kill white families.
Folks, let me explain something to you.
"Diversity" is a code word.
And what it means is white genocide!
So, we'll begin marching at the courthouse.
And after two blocks-- wait a minute, wait a minute.
This is not the order that we agreed to.
Aryan Alliance is supposed to be heading this march.
Now just a second, Andrew.
You know, we're at this rally every year, and we start with the colonial patriots.
Well, this isn't "every year," is it?
To be fair, Harris, maybe we should.
You're a local organization...
Vince, can you introduce me to Dallas?
"The klan"?
You're not "the klan."
Yeah, sure.
Come on, let's go.
You're the "invisible white knights" of the Ku Klux Klan!
Which is what, the third klan group in the DC Metro area?
!
Hey, Dallas!
Good to see you.
It's... it's Vince, Vince sargent?
Right, Vince.
Good to see you.
Good to see you.
I want to introduce you to my good friend, this is Nate Thomas.
- I'm a huge fan of your show.
- Thank you, sir.
If you'll excuse me.
I have to get ready for the march.
- Uh, Mr. Wolf?
- Yes, what is it?
I didn't want to get into this in front of Vince, but I'd like to talk to you about an investment.
- An "investment"?
- Mm-hm.
I represent a few people who are big fans of yours, and they want to help.
- Is that so?
- Yes, sir.
They have a number of assets in the online media space, and they feel the potential for your show is being limited by your advertising budget.
They want to help you penetrate some new markets, and they see no reason why you can't go nationwide.
Well, that is great, son.
That is just great.
Here, call this number and we'll talk.
Okay, great.
That sounds great, Mr. Wolf.
- Call me, Dallas.
- Thank you.
Racist scum!
Racist scum!
We're here today because we're proud of our race!
We love our race!
And we're here to say that.

But nobody seems to give a damn!

Racist scum!
Racist scum!
Racist bum!
It's the fucking AFL.
Don't worry, they won't do shit.
Well, well, well, if it isn't the American fucking losers!
Yeah, fuck you!
Why don't you come over the fucking barricade, motherfuckers!
Johnny!
Hey, man, just fucking stay back, okay?
- Don't fucking do it.
- I gotta help him.
Help him by not getting the fuck arrested, okay?
- Fucking pussies!
-
- White Nazi scum!
Yeah, you know what?
I can do that shit, too.
I'm gonna fucking kill you, motherfucker!
- Do not engage.
Do not engage.
- You think I'm playing around?
I'm gonna fucking kill you!
Get your hands off of me!
I'm gonna kill these motherfuckers!
Stay back!
- WHITE POWER!

He hit me in the fucking eye!
It's fucking piss!
Johnny!
Andrew, can you walk?
Get the fuck outta here.
You okay?
Everyone okay?
Sorry.
Okay.
Stay with us.
I'm getting you out of here, man.
Go... go right, go right!
Oh, fuck!
- Fuck!
- Fucking...
Holy shit!
We gotta go!
We gotta fucking go!
I can't fucking go anywhere!
Stay down!
Fuck!
No, don't get up.
You need to rest.
I brought you some chamomile tea.
It'll help you relax.
Thank you.
There's our wounded warrior.
How you feeling, buddy?
Yeah, much better.
Thank you, guys.
Ah, no problem.
I'm gonna put some music on.
I brought you Sammy to keep you company.
Thanks.
Oh, wow.
You like it?
I...
I love Brahms.
See, Becky, i knew he was quality.
I think the fourth is my favorite.
Yeah, mine, too.
Except maybe the-- the first?
Yeah.
Now listen, if you like Brahms,
I've got this clarinet quintet that will blow your mind.
They're dead, Gerry.
Dead.
I'm gonna find them, and we're gonna string them up-- alright, I hear ya.
I hear ya.
That's why I avoid the political stuff.
Not my thing.
Besides, I've heard it can be dangerous.
That was fantastic.
Thank you...
I thought you guys were vegetarians.
Everybody's gotta have a few vices every now and then.
What's "vices"?
Oh, boy, there we go!
I'm sorry about that, that's my ride.
Gerry, Becky, thanks for everything.
Nathan, I don't know what to say.
I owe you, big time.
Why don't you stop by the compound some time.
Oh, I'm not really in Ohio that much, but I'd love to if I ever am.
No, I meant the...
The new one.
- Oh.
- Here in Virginia.
Oh, right, yeah, please, I'd love to.
- Bye.
- Have a good night.
Bye, Andrew!
Well, listen, you're not going to believe it, but when it comes to Tchaikovsky...
Gotta go with Bernstein.
- Leonard Bernstein?
- I know, I know.
Gerry, I hate to break it to you, man--
I know.
Listen, I can't help it, he's a great conductor.
Jews listen to Wagner, don't they?
So, Gerry, if you don't mind my asking, how did you end up in the movement?
Listen, for me, it was the books.
My parents were practically liberals.
Totally blinded by the zog.
You know, I always knew something was wrong;
and I had this anger,
I couldn't put my finger on it, until here.
It all started with this.
I was 13.
Read it in four days.
It explains race, culture, capitalism and how democracy destroyed western civilization.
Democracy:
"Three people form a government.
Then two of them vote to steal the wealth of the third."
- David Lane, right?
- Mm-hm.
Now here's something more recent.
You'll love this.
This breaks down the entire worldwide zionist conspiracy, step by step.
- You can bring it back.
- Oh, no, I couldn't.
Nate, Nate, please.
But that was it?
I mean, it was just books woke you up?
Well, you know, i had my theories.
And then a three-month engineering contract opened up in Kenya.
I was young, i wanted to see the world.
And, uh, Nate, listen,
I got no problem with them having their own country, everybody should.
But if you go there, and you see, they weren't even living like animals.
You know, animals don't live in their own feces, do they?
So, if you ever have any doubt white men created civilization, just go have a look.
Hey.
So,howwasthe Brahms?
Howdoyoureason withsomeonelikethat?
Howcanyoueverhope tochangetheirmind?
Listen,youneedtorememberwhyyou're doingthis.
We'renotsocialworkers.
Youwantedme to relate tothemas humanbeings,right?
"Openupto them?"You said.
...theyweren'teven livinglikeanimals.
Youwantto getadrink?
Wherearewe gonnago andgetadrink?
This suspect, he was a fucking nightmare.
He was grabbing my ass, the whole thing.
And he kept insisting i go to this club with him, where I knew he was gonna make his big move, but if I didn't go, then, you know, I could blow my whole cover.
So what did you do?
So we're at a bar, and I tell him I want oysters.
So I get a dozen, i start plowing through them.
Then I start acting queasy.
I run to the bathroom, stick my finger down my throat.
- No way!
- Yeah!
So now there's puke all over my dress,
I tell him I got sick off the oysters and take a cab home.
Two days later, he was arrested.
- That is fucking awesome.
- Oh, it was fucked up.
But there was the thrill, you know?
That high.
God, there's nothing like it.
Yeah, so why'd you stop?
It was just it's no way to live, the paranoia, the tension.
And I wanted to spend more time with my kids.
You got kids?
You don't think I'm mommy material?
No, no... no.
Yeah, I got two princesses.
Mommy and daddy.
Perfect, little suburban life.
Anyway, I know how lonely this work can be.
But the case won't go forever.
You can't change the way people think, but you are making a difference.
Nathan, good to see you.
Can we get you anything, coffee?
Oh, no, I'm good, thanks.
This is a great set-up you got here.
Yeah, thanks.
All right, let's give you the tour.
This parcel is actually pretty small, but we're purchasing the one next to it.
Although, citizens groups are trying to block us out.
Oh, yeah.
How are you handling that?
Well, we tell them we're here to stay.
Make no mistake about it.
We show up at their homes, their businesses, their churches.
They backed down pretty quick after that.
So you're moving the national headquarters?
No, we're keeping the compound in Ohio, it's just with everything going on right now, we needed a stronger presence here.
You know?
- Is that your firing range?
- Yeah, come on.
It's a little primitive, but we're working on it.
I'm no marksman, by any means, but I have some expertise in range design, just from training the Iraqi police.
What's your danger area template?
To contain your cone of fire.
I mean, how do you control your overshoot?
Uh...
We haven't gotten to that yet.
Okay, well, you might want to make sure it's the kikes and niggers getting hit and not your guys.
Absolutely.
Maybe if you have time,
- you could talk to the guys about it.
- Yeah, sure,
I need to see what kind of equipment you've got, but I'm happy to.
Okay.
Uh, come on up here.
Right now were just using this for storage.
- Are those cots?
- Yup.
We'll be able to sleep 200 in there.
And we're gonna need to.
I'm not gonna beat around the bush.
You see the type of organization we have here, but we could always use a man like you, Nathan.
Educated, war veteran, clean record.
I mean, hell, you don't even have any parking tickets.
Yeah, we have our contacts in law enforcement, local, state, federal, not to mention military hospitals, laboratories, you name it.
And so what's the overall objective here?
I mean, are you just trying to get the message out, or what?
Get the... get the message out?
To who?
We're not trying to recruit the public here.
What would we do with them?
They're at home sitting on their asses,
- watching sitcoms and surfing Facebook.
This is revolutionary activity we're talking about here.
Look, I'm flattered by the interest, but, you know,
I've been around the movement awhile now and a lot of these guys are all talk.
Now for me to really want to get involved,
I need to know there's bigger things going on here.
No offense.
Yeah... none taken.
All right...
Take a look at this.
This is the entire DC water system.
Plants, pipelines, the whole deal.
Now, Nathan, the guys you're hanging out with, they're all talk, because they're punks.
They're amateurs.
They sit around drinking beer all day, maybe they beat up a few niggers or each other.
We got no use for them.
We need men like you.
Can I help you?
I'm looking for Dallas Wolf, but I must have the wrong house.
Oh, no, he's here.
Come in.
Randy!
Someone's here!
Hey, Nate.
The studio's back here.
I'm moving studios right now, so this is all temporary.
Oh, no, this is a great setup.
Thanks for taking the time to see me, Dallas.
I just spent the afternoon with Andrew at the Aryan Alliance.
Oh, yeah?
Andrew's great.
They have an incredible organization.
Yeah, they seem really serious about the struggle.
About doing whatever it takes.
They're true patriots, those guys.
Well, let me give you a bit of background on me.
I was in Iraq for three years, on a WMD squad.
And then when I got back, my military contacts helped me set up a medical supply company.
V-a-l-e.
Wow, this is great.
Yeah, we do it all, from bandages and syringes to X-ray and radiotherapy equipment.
And with the highly regulated stuff, we can cut through a lot of the red tape and deal directly, and discreetly.
Fantastic, Nate.
Great to know.
So... you'd also mentioned an investment?
For the show?
Yes, I've got an investor lined up who's very excited about expanding your reach.
We're talking advertising, marketing, bigger servers...
That's exactly what I need.
So how do I meet him?
Well, a lot of my military contacts don't like to publicize their efforts.
But he'd love for you to put together a proposal about how you'd expand the show.
Funny you should mention that.
I've been trying to raise $7,500 to break into the Florida market.
They're ripe right now, with all the immigration stuff.
Yeah... yeah, this is great!
So, there's one more thing.
Go ahead, shoot.
The reason he's helping you is because he feels that you are a man of action, as he is.
As I am.
Right, sure.
So for him to move forward, he needs to know you're serious about this.
Nate, I've been ready to give my life for this cause for 20 years now.
What I need is the right people behind me.
So you tell your investor that if he wants action, he's got the right guy.
Um, sorry, Dallas, I've got kind of a long drive back, you mind if I hit the head?
The whole case is about to blow wide open!
He's in with Wolf, he's in with the Aryan Alliance.
Yeah, and all we need to keep Wolf on the line is that $7,500!
Let me get this straight.
So after everything we spent on your cover, even after the medical supply business, you want me to ask for $7,500 asan"investment" inthisguy'sradioshow ?
You're the only one with a budget right now!
Oh, yeah, I'm just flush with cash!
I'm trying to run a 40-man investigation ontopof allthe shit I'vealreadygot!
Sir, the alliance is building a compound outside DC.
Wolf's house is setting off a geiger counter!
I spent six hours last night reading your transcripts,
Nate, you don't have shit!
Youdon'thaveshit!
Look at how much carbon is built up on this bolt.
- See?
See that?
Like-- - yeah.
That's unacceptable.
When's the last time you cleaned this?
I've been meaning to get to most of them.
Okay, guys, seriously!
Okay, so we got an ar-15, serial number A00724, needs a new buffer spring.
Come on, guys, let's go!
We need to go through the whole inventory.
Andrew's waiting on this.
I'm gonna have to tell Andrew, the only way it's gonna change is with new policies.
And how do I know it's not me you're trying to fuck?
Fuck you, you calling us liars?
You get on the phone yourself!
Call them up and ask them...
Hey, guys...
Hey, Nate...
It's been a while.
Yeah, you kinda disappeared on us.
I'm sorry about that, Vince.
I've been kind of busy.
Yeah, I bet you have.
Seems like you made a bunch of new friends around here, huh?
See, we were just wondering if maybe you could explain--
Roy!
Thanks for stopping by.
Be seeing you, Nate.
What was that all about?
Roy says the police have been following him.
He's paranoid about infiltrators.
Infiltrators, huh?
Yeah.
Mm.
That's why the police are on his ass?
Have you seen how that guy behaves?
It's a miracle he's not in jail already.
Right, uh, you want to help us with something?
Sure, what's up?
I'm throwing a youth event for Hitler's birthday.
There's a campground a couple miles from here.
- Help us scout it.
- Sounds good.
It's amazing how much land there is right outside DC.
Let me ask you something, Nathan.
What's your opinion on infiltration?
Well, how do you mean?
How do we prevent it?
Well, it's tough.
For one thing, you gotta keep guys with rap sheets out of important positions.
That's... that's how they flip most people.
We have a polygraph back at the compound.
Maybe we should make everybody take it.
I mean, i think someone who's trained can beat a polygraph without blinking.
Yeah, maybe we should just do a background checks for everybody.
Get everyone's records and documents together?
Yeah, I mean, for informants, that might work.
But for law enforcement, they just forge whatever they need.
Yeah, but with a few phone calls, you know, a cover only runs so deep.
Do you suspect someone?
You know, it's like they say at these rallies.
You look to the left, look to the right, one of these people is a snitch.
It's the left.
Turn left right up here.
You okay there, Nate?
You look a little off?
No, I'm good.
Just, uh, tired...
Been a long day.
Well, I think this is a great location.
What do you think?
Yeah, I like it.
Uh, well, what about the permits, though?
We tell them we're a Christian organization, holding a youth event.
I gotta ask you something.
Roy said he contacted the NPRC.
Said there's no record of you having served in the marines.
You mean Roy went and filed a 180 with a government that he fucking hates, just to... okay.
I was on a WMD squad, so that's Black Ops.
And he knows that, the fucker.
Wait, hold on, are you guys taking this seriously?
Is that what that was all about in the truck?
Because, I understand you have todo your do your due diligence or whatever, but that's a fucking serious accusation!
I don't need to take that shit from anybody!
- Hey... hey, hey!
- Least of all from--
okay.
Let's get out of here.
Nate,listen.
Weneedto getthe serialnumbersfirst ,andthen-- no, look, I don't have time for that!
What if he wasn't convinced?
What if he calls Wolf?
The account name is Nate Foster, please.
You don't know if he was convinced!
You don't even know if they talk, okay?
You're being-- yeah, I'd like $7,500 in cash.
You're a man of your word, which is a rare thing in this movement.
So, listen, Dallas, my investor is very excited, but he wants to know some more about what you're planning, some details.
Oh, okay, I think it was all in the presentation, but we start with online in Tampa, and then we move down the- no, no, I mean, beyond that.
- Beyond Florida?
Beyond the show, like what we talked about.
The actions we're gonna take.
I'm sorry, Nate.
I lost you.
What do you mean?
What I mean is, you have been talking a lot about a lot of big things that are coming.
Bigger than Oklahoma City, bigger than 9/11-- oh, yeah, for sure.
Which is why expanding the show is so important.
Right, and I have been spending a lot of time with Andrew at the Aryan Alliance.
He told me you'd been working together.
Well, yeah, sure, i mean, he came to the rally.
No, no, what my investor needs to know is what are the concrete steps that you are taking to start the race war.
As I said to you before,
I have the expertise, the connections, the tools.
Maybe there's some kind of misunderstanding.
I thought we were talking about expanding the show.
Yeah, which my investor is happy to do, but if you're not willing to be honest about the other actions you're taking, then he's not gonna be able to support you.
Okay, Nate, fair enough.
Sorry it didn't work out.
I saw the plans, Dallas, for the water system.
Andrew showed them to me, okay?
So, I know all about it, and now I just need you to stop pretending and be honest with me.
This is private property.
You're no longer welcome here.
I'm asking you to leave.
Come on, Dallas.
I'm on your side.
Get the fuck out.
Now.
Fuck.
We'regoingto theoffice,
DallasWolfis there.
Youbroughthimin?
No.
Hecametous.
Sir.
I didn't know you'd be here.
Has anyone talked to him?
No, no, of course not.
No, it's your show.
So, Dallas.
Or should I call you Randy?
That is your real name.
You can call me whatever you like, agent Zamparo.
Any reason you're using an assumed name?
I'm a public entertainer.
Ah... fine.
So, tell me why you're here today.
I'm here because of the guy I called about.
He shows up at my conference, talking about investing in my show.
Butthen,he 'stellingmehowhe cangethighlyregulateditems.

- $7,500.
- Wow.
That's a lot.

- Because he's a wacko!

Let me play you something, okay, Randy.
Ihaveinformation abouta truckaccident outsideDClastnight,involving classifiedradioactivematerial, butnowtheFBI istrying tocoverit allup.
Why ?
You've gotta be kidding me.
It's a radio show.
It's entertainment!
So you think it's entertaining to predict and incite terrorist attacks?
Whether I think it's entertaining is irrelevant.
Why don't you talk to somebody around here who knows something about the law, preferably a man!
Brandenburgvs.Ohio,1969,itis not illegaltoadvocateviolence.
Thefirstamendmentdoesn'tprotectpeople whohaveknowledgeofanactualcrime!
What knowledge of a crime do I have?
Well, why don't you tell me, Randy?
What is this accident?
What is this FBI cover-up?
Why are you living at an unregistered address?
And why is that location lighting up a geiger counter?
You've been following me?
You've been casing my house?
Why don't you answer my questions?
Letmeshowyou something.

- Now, tom, look...
- Now, tom, look, what?
Really, what could you possibly have to say?
Because this is a fucking disaster!
I warned you, i tried to tell you.
- We still might have a weapons case!
- We ran those serial numbers.
Every single one of those guns is legally registered.
Every one!
Okay, so you think there's nothing to any of this?
Right?
The prepaid cellphones?
The barracks for 200 guys?
- The water system plans?
- They're conspiracy theorists!
It's all talk!
He keeps those plans around to trot out when he wants to act like a big shot!
What are they gonna do, they're gonna put radioactive material in the water supply?
That doesn't make any fucking sense!
You two, you pull this from here and that from there, and you're making up this whole big fucking story in your head, and it's bullshit!
You know, we see what we want to see!
Well, now you've compromised him, and you've compromised the bureau, and you've wasted all our fucking time!
This happens sometimes, you know?
- I mean, it sucks, but-- - "this happens"?
Is that all you're gonna fucking say after we find out all of this?
Everything you fucking put me through has been for nothing?
It's the nature of the work.
No!
This... this happened because of your pet theory!
And like an idiot, i went along with it!
"Oh, yeah, she's an expert," i thought.
"She knows what she's doing!"
I'm sorry, Nate.
Fucking why?
Why are you even sorry?
This has been great for you!
You got the thrill back!
You got the excitement you've been wanting, you got an escape from your little suburban life,
- by manipulating me!
- No, that is not fair!
I thought we had a case!
God, do you even know how many dead ends I've been down?
No, you fucking knew!
You knew I was so eager, so desperate to do something meaningful, to actually work on a real case in this place, that I would do anything you wanted, while you just sat back and enjoyed the ride!
Yeah.
Fuck!
Nate!
Hey, good to see you!
I've been calling you!
Yeah, I know, I'm sorry about that, I've been really busy.
I just wanted to return these.
I'm heading out of town for a couple of months, gonna work on setting up the business on the west coast.
Oh, wow, wow, well, please come in.
Uh, that's nice of you, but I don't think I can.
Aw, come on, just for a cup of tea?
Is everything okay, Nate?
Yeah, yeah, why do you ask?
Well, you said you're headed out west.
Yeah, I'm gonna work on setting up the business on the west coast.
Right.
God, it's hard to find what we're looking for in life.
But then, I listen to something like that.
One man made something...
That will make millions, maybe billions of people feel the way we just did.
We all have that power, Nate.
All of us.
Honestly...
I used to feel that way, Gerry.
I always felt like i could change the world.
You know, I could right wrongs, you know, fight injustice.
Nate, listen, it's guys like us that feel these things the most.
Idealists.
Yeah, I just keep thinking about that quote.
"For evil to triumph, it only takes good men to do nothing."
But how?
You know, fucking how?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Gerry, i shouldn't be...
- It's all right.
- I'm just really tired.
You know, Nate, maybe you're going about this the wrong way.
The rallies, the speeches, the politics...
That's not how the change is gonna come.
It's gonna come from the unknown soldiers, from the leaderless resistance.
How do you mean?
Let's go out back.
I made some improvements to the tree house.
Talking frankly is something we have to be very careful about.
- Something we always do outdoors.
- Right, of course.
You know, I've thinking about this for a long time, Nate, years really.
What's needed is an event.
What kind of event?
An event that wakes people up.
They're sleepwalkers out there.
They're blind.
Think about this regime.
Media brainwashing, secret courts, mass surveillance, waco, Ruby Ridge.
Using Katrina and 9/11 to set up "refugee camps," or "detention camps", in other words, concentration camps, because who cares about the rights of a few arabs, niggers and racists, if it makes us safer?
Right?
That's how it all starts.
All the lies that the zionists tell about Nazi Germany, that's what's actually happening right now!
The irony of it!
Right?
That's why we gotta be smart.
That's why the event has to force the ZOG to show its hand.
It's gotta reveal the men behind the curtain.
Because it's not the event that wakes people up, it's the reaction to the event.
Yes!
Yes, you get it!
Yeah, look at the sons of Liberty.
Look at the IRA.
That is how you start a revolution.
Yeah, yeah, I always felt this kinship with you, Nate.
And...
I wanted to talk openly with you, but I just haven't known you that long, but I know in my heart, i can trust you.
You can.
You can, Gerry, i want to help.
I want to make a difference.
Okay.
I still got connections from my Africa days.
Okay, and we have the means to create that kind of event.
But, Nate, if you get involved we may not live to see the world we're building.
But I'll have helped to build it.
A man's body dies, but his deeds live forever.
There's a way you can help us.
- Okay, yeah.
- Come here.
We need to talk to the S.A.C., now!
Oh, my lord, who the hell wrapped it?
You guys aren't trying to give it a bath!
Oh, hey, guys!
Sorry abut that, just having some technical difficulties over here.
- No problem!
- Be right over...
- Okay, one, two...
- Hey, Morgan, David...
I want you to meet somebody.
This is Nate.
Morgan, good to meet you.
- Greetings, sir.
I'm David.
- Hey, you guys.
So is the wedding out here?
Yeah, it's right over here.
It's beautiful, isn't it?
Wait till we see it all lit up.
Pure of spirit and pure of race, these two souls commit themselves to the defense and prosperity of their sacred blood.
May their sons and daughters fill this land, forever honoring their duty to folk, kindred, soil, and honor.
Iknowyouguys don'tknowNatethatwell .
But he's a good man and he's a good soldier.
If you trust me, you can trust him.
No luck yet.
No one wants to sell to an anonymous buyer.
If we give up that prepaid phone crap, I use my real name,
I got three guys I can get it from right now.
If we do it the morning of-- yeah, I thought we were at least trying to do this without getting caught?
Guys, guys, shh.
Nate has a potential solution for us.
Tatp.
It's much better than ammonium nitrate anyway.
A smaller quantity will give you a much bigger blast.
Yeah, well, sure, but where are we gonna get that?
I run a medical supply company.
And you're gonna get tatp?
I know it's not the easiest thing, but I've got some connections.
I can make a few calls and loop back with Gerry.
Assuming I can, what are we gonna do about the cesium powder itself?
Ready when we need it.
No, I mean, how are we going to handle it?
Well we've got heavy gloves, and we've got goggles.
No... radioactive particles will pass through those as easy as anything else, including your skin.
- Well, what do you suggest?
- I think we need suits.
They'll be pretty bulky, but we only need to wear them when the powder's out in the open.
When do we need them by?
Well, we've just been waiting for the explosive.
If you can get the TATP, Sunday is our day.
You guys remember Timothy McVeigh's last words?
Yeah, he read invictus.
"It matters not how strait the gait, how charged with punishments the scroll,
I am the master of my fate:
I am the captain of my soul."
Are you sure this is gonna look right?
Wow.
It looks great.
The secret is the smell.
Where's the bleach powder?
Oh, it's right over here.
And you're sure they're not gonna try and test this somehow?
Yeah, that's why terrorists love TATP.
You can't identify it without a mass spectrometer.
Okay, if you say so.
Yeah.
Uh-huh, yeah, I'm here now.
Sunday, so team's in place Friday night.
Look, can I just say
I'm sorry about what i said to you the other day.
I was exhausted.
Don't worry about it.
That's what this job does to you.
Keep at it another ten years and you'll turn into a real asshole...
like me.
It's totally secure.
We can keep everything in here, and then, on game day, we can use this space to put it all together.
Great, great.
This is great, Nate.
And here is the TATP.
- No problems, inquiries?
- Nope.
All good.
Morgan's a pharmacist.
All right.
Hm, these crystals seem a little small.
Smells about right.
Okay, let's test it.
Test it?
You got a mass spectrometer in your bag?
No, we'll just see if it burns.
What?
No, whoa, whoa!
Hold on, what do you mean?
Burn it?
What are you talking about?
Well, we use a sample, we set it a light.
It burns for a while before it explodes.
I saw it on YouTube.
Are you insane?
Do you know how dangerous this stuff is?
Hey, you are not the only one with experience!
This is a highly unstable substance, okay?
It's sensitive to heat, friction-- which is why I'll do the test carefully!
Now you want to see the video?
Because I have it here on my phone!
I don't give a shit about what's on your phone!
We are not lighting this stuff on fire!
You know how many bomb techs i saw get their faces blown off trying to deal with this stuff in Iraq?
I've worked with this company for two years!
They are not gonna send me a container full of baking soda, okay?
Gerry, this doesn't work for me, okay, if he doesn't trust me, or my suppliers-- we need to test the fucking stuff!
You don't fucking trust me or my suppliers, that is your problem!
You want to use ammonium nitrate, fine with me!
- Okay.
- Fine with me.
Nate, Nate, Nate.
It's all right.
It's fine, it's fine.
Morgan, Morgan, he's right.
Come on.
He's right.
So, can we see the suits?
And it's kind of hard with the gloves, but... and you zip that up and fasten along there.
You guys, what would be worse, radiation poisoning or wearing this thing around for a couple hours?
Yeah.
Soifyoueverhave anydoubt whitemencreatedcivilization, justgohavealook .
Howdoyoureason withsomeonelikethat?
Howcanyoueverhope tochangetheirmind?
Hello?
Hey, hey, listen, something's wrong.
David drove to Frederick County earlythismorning andwentto afarmsupply.
Itlookslikehebought ammoniumnitrate.
And now they're all at Gerry's.
But it's Saturday?
And why do they need ammonium nitrate?
I don't know.
Me and Hernandez are heading over to meet the surveillance team at Gerry's now.
- What are you going to do?
- I don't know!
No!
No!
You can not raid them yet!
You don't even know if they have the cesium?
And Gerry's phone's off.
Okay, I have to go over there.
No,Nate!
It--
- What are you doing here?
- I was calling, you didn't answer.
I got worried.
- Bullshit!
Why are you here?
- I just told you!
I'm gonna give you one more chance.
Okay, what the fuck is wrong with this guy?
I called three times, you didn't answer any of them!
I got worried something happened to you!
All right, put it down!
He's telling the truth!
- Were you followed?
-
- No, I wasn't!
- Are you sure?
- Yes!
I was worried, so I was checking constantly!
Okay, calm down, everybody calm down.
Okay, can somebody tell me what is going on?
I sent David to do surveillance on your shop last night.
I saw an electrical crew go into the building across the street.
- So?
- In the middle of the night?
Could there be like a power problem?
No, they must have traced the TATP you ordered.
- Okay, if they're on to the shop...
- Fuck.
...they're on to you.
Are you sure you weren't followed?
- Yes!
- If he said he wasn't, he wasn't!
Stay calm and keep your eyes open.
Morgan, get back to work, please, Jesus.
We had to move forward, immediately.
It would have been only a matter of time before they were on to us, too.
And you weren't gonna let me know?
Nate, I'm sorry.
It's too risky.
Well, he's here now, let's get him to help!
What about the TATP?
David got ammonium nitrate instead.
He used his name, so the jig is up.
They'll know it's us.
It's not gonna matter tomorrow.
We're in this to the end now, Nate.
Do you understand?
They're not gonna take us alive.
All right, let me help.
Okay, okay, good.
Come over here.
I should go wash up so I don't contaminate anything.
Oh...
Hey, Nate!
How are you?
- Nate!
- The cesium is here!
All right, everyone!
Let's get ready to do this!
No!
Angela, you have to tell him to wait.
Wait?
No, no, no, we need to get in there now!
There are three guys in there with machine guns and they're building a bomb.
This is a residential neighborhood.
His wife and kids are in the house.
Ifyoucomeinhere now, it'llbeabloodbath .
This is a volatile situation.
Yeah, which is why we need to move now...
No, he doesn't get it!
These guys are fanatics!
They will not be taken alive!
Tom, you're not in there!
We have to listen to him.
And what the fuck happens if the explosives go off whilewe'rewaitingaround?
Nate,yougot60seconds todisarmthoseguys, becausewe'recomingin.
Okay, let's get these suits ready.
Okay, let's get ready to move!
We are almost done here!
Fuck!
The cesium spilled!
Shit, get the suits on!
Go, go, go!
Come on!
Come on, help me!
Help me!
Get zipped up!
Get zipped up!
Son of a...
Shit, come on!
- Come on, get your hood on!
- No!
No!
...stop!
Get the gun!
It's me!
It's me!
It's me!
Are you okay?
You all right?
- You all right?
- Yeah, no, I'm good, I'm good.
I know my rights!
I'm a patriot of the United States!
- Shut your fucking mouth!
- Fuck you!
Come on, get up!
Surprise!
Thepaperworkcamein...
Houston.
Yeah...
Texas.
Can you believe it?
Good margaritas, I hear.
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm gonna miss it here, though.
Well, "it's" going to miss you, too.
"This should have been a noble creature;
he hath all the energy which would have made a goodly frame of glorious elements, had they been wisely mingled."
Gerry?
Yeah, Gerry, and all of them, really.
Yeah, that's why you were the right guy for the job.
What do you mean?
Why do you think I picked you?
I knew that you would understand them.
And they'd understand you.
And the more authentic you became with them, the more authentic they'd become with you.
Because when it comes down to it, there really is only one essential ingredient to fascism.
It'svictimhood.
I blamed those black kids, and I blamed this school,
I blamed the cops;
I blamed everybody.
I was gonna hurt everyone else the way they hurt me.
I look at you guys and I see myself.
But you guys don't have to make the same mistakes I did.
You don't have to be victims.
Hey.
- Hey.
- Hey.
That was great.
Thanks.
Dude, thanks...
Thanks for coming by.
I'm so proud of you, Johnny.
You know what they say...
It all begins with the word.
You have the phone?
ShouldI doit now?
Notyet.
Waituntil wegetto thecheckpoint.
Okay, guys, this is it.
Hey, Ivy league's gun, put that gun back away.
- What are you talking about?
- I don't need some egghead who just scored an 81 on his qual shooting my dick off, okay?
This is my fucking guy!
I'm not just gonna sit here while you-- guys, enough!
Nate, just follow our lead, okay?
Is your heart clear?
Areyousure youwantto do this?
The signal will be better outside.
Here it is.
Did it work?
- Drop it!
- Freeze!
- Hands in the air!
- Turn around!
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
You have the right to an attorney.

Can I get in there?
Salam aleikum.
What the fuck, tom?
I have this room at 4:00!
I know you don't get a lot of news downstairs, zamparo, but we just broke up a massive terrorist plot, all right?
Try and keep up.
Um...
What?
What is it?
Sir, when I flagged up this guy's email,
I thought the investigation was only gonna proceed if there was substantive criminal evidence to back it up.
We've got hours of him talking about waging jihad and killing children.
Right, but talking, though, sir, not... he's not doing anything.
Isn't that the point?
Hey, Tim.
How's it going?
You celebrating something, Nate?
You seeing someone special, huh?
Uh, yeah, actually.
How'd you guess?
Genius, emergency meeting in the conference room!
The crash was off 301 around 2:00 last night.
Local police controlled the scene, so, thankfully, the press knows nothing.
These containers carried cesium-137.
It's used for radiotherapy applications in hospitals, but it's highly regulated and had no business being on that truck.
When we tracked the shipment back to Baltimore, the customs record showed eight containers, not two.
So there's six more of them out there, all of them in the country illegally.
If that quantity made it's way into a radiological device, we could be looking at thousands of casualties, mass evacuations and radioactive contamination throughout the D.C. area.
- Tom?
- Yeah.
Uh, lab analysis puts the cesium coming from north Africa.
So the guys on four, they put together this map.
It's an analysis of Muslim communities in DC, Maryland and Virginia, along with their countries of origin.
We'd like each-- yes?
What about leads on the dt front?
Well, given the cesium came from north Africa, we don't think domestic is really in the picture.
The last time anyone tried to build a dirty bomb on us soil was James cummings.
He was a white supremacist living in Maine, he was going to set it off at Obama's inauguration.
He had uranium, thorium, and he was trying to acquire cesium.
I'm sure you're familiar with the case.
It goes without saying, anyone here is welcome to pursue any leads they think are fruitful.
Okay, would you fucking stop- oh, I'm so sorry.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- I'm Angela zamparo.
- Nate foster.
- I know.
You got a couple minutes?
Dt's downstairs.
There's only one perk to being down in this shithole.
Nicorette just isn't the same.
So, Nate...
You seem like you've got a bit more going on than most around here.
You remember Oklahoma city?
Well, yeah, i guess I was five, but sure.
What do you know about Timothy McVeigh?
Ah... he was some kind of lone extremist in a militia?
Don't be an asshole who bullshits questions you don't know the answer to.
Here.
Timothy McVeigh was a decorated Gulf war veteran.
He was not insane;
He was not a lunatic;
And he was not stupid.
He was a white supremacist, following a plan.
- What plan?
- A plan from a book called the Turner diaries.
It's about a "race war" to exterminate blacks, Jews, and "mud people."
You know how the war gets started?
The hero drives a truck bomb into a federal building.
Timothy McVeigh was reenacting that scene from the Turner diaries.
He was carrying the book with him when he was arrested.
What he was trying to do was start the race war.
You're focused on the islamic guys.
I get it.
We all create a narrative based on what we think is important.
We see what we want to see.
But just because you're not looking at something doesn't mean it's not there.
So, why are you telling me this?
I'm talking about a blood andguts,in thestreet, killorbe killedracewar.
Ihaveinformation abouta truckaccident outsideDClastnight, involvingclassified radioactivematerial.
ButnowtheFBI istrying tocoverit allup.
Why ?
Becausesomething bigishappening, andit'sbiggerthan9/11 , andit'sbiggerthan Oklahomacity.
Sobewarned, bearmed,andbeready.
His name is Dallas wolf.
He gets 20,000 listeners a night.
We believe he's based just outside of DC, but almost nobody knows him personally.
But I have an informant, a skinhead in a gang.
And the leader of that gang is friends with wolf.
So I need someone to get in there, and get close to him.
Right and I'm trying to tell you that this is not my thing!
I barely passed the pft!
What do you think undercover work is?
Beating guys up and shooting at them?
No, it's people skills.
It's controlling situations.
- It's this.
- Seriously?
This is the only undercover training you'll ever need.
I saw you with that Muslim kid.
You got most of this going on anyway.
Look, I read your file.
High IQ, great people skills, but not your typical FBI profile.
Introverted, an outsider, unhappy childhood.
Single mother, always moving around a lot, always the new kid, bullied at school, no close friends or-- okay, okay, okay, fuck you!
That's... this is an invasion.
What gives you the right to look-- because we don't have time to dick around here!
You don't smuggle a boatload of cesium into the country and then just let it fucking sit there!
Fine, but I'm trying to tell you,
I don't have the skills for this!
I can't even defend myself!
You do have the skills, and they mean you will never have to!
What did you say to that kid?
"You want to change things, so nobody has to suffer the way you did."
Adirtybomb isanykindofcrude, explosivedevice thatwhendetonated, dispersesradiation aroundandbeyondthe blast.

Are you out of your fucking mind?
Do you know how management looks at undercover, Nate?
You think this office is bad?
They'll have you chasing pedophiles on an Indian reservation.
I just want to discuss the option, sir.
Discuss the option?
Of what, of killing your whole career?

Youknowwhata"necktie"is?
They slit your throat, and they pull your tongue right out through it?
Oh, shut the fuck up!
Oh, what, so you want him to go in blind, so he has no idea what he's getting into?
You're just trying to manipulate him!
And you're not?
You do whatever the fuck you want.
But you better think long and hard about this.

Okay.
Not bad.
What else?
What's this?
It's my dd-214.
I was up all night Photoshop-ing it, so if anyone wants to see proof of my service in the marines, they can just-- what the fuck are you doing?
No, no, no, no.
Listen to me.
If you get yourself in a situation where you have to show somebody your dd-214, then you're already done.
You understand?
Good.
Now what else?

Principle #3:
Arouse in the other person an eager want.
So what do they want from you?
My loyalty?
I'm loyal, I'm dedicated to the the cause.
No.
Any thug can be loyal.
What do you have...
What the guys with the cesium... are gonna want?
Welcome to medvale medical supply company.
My military contacts helped me start this business.
Most of our sales are online.
Our radiotherapy products are specifically designed for the handling and storing of radioactive material.
So we can acquire sensitive materials and hide them.
Hisnameis frankhedges.
He'sbeenacifortwoyears.
He's in a gang called the panzer strikeforce, and the leader of the gang is this guy.
Vince sargent.
He's friends with Dallas wolf.
So Vince and Dallas wolf are tight?
Yeah, I told you, Vince calls into wolf's show every week.
Sofrankbringsyou intothegang, youhangout, getsomecredibility, youmaketheseguyslike you.
YougetclosetoVince.
Then,youusehim togetto knowwolf.
This is my friend Nate i was telling you about.
Hey, everybody.
14/88, brother.
Good to meet you.
All right, spread 'em.
Roy does our security.
Okay, fine.
Whoa, whoa, hey, what the fuck is that?
- What's what?
- That!
Under your fucking shirt there!
What is that?
Hey, are you a cop?
Hey, look me in my fucking eyes, boy!
Are you a fucking cop?
- No, I'm not.
- No?
Whoo!
He's fine.
Sorry about that, Nate.
But you know how it is.
- Yeah, absolutely.
- Whoa, whoa.
Have a seat.
You drink bud?
Uh, yeah, absolutely.
Frank tells me you were in Iraq.
Uh, yeah, three years in the corps.
- You kill anybody?
- Johnny!
He's Johnny.
He's a fresh cut.
We're trying to teach him the ropes.
I know the fuckin' ropes, man.
Yeah, then mind your fucking manners!
So, did you?
Kill anybody?
I don't talk about that.
But what I did see was a lot of our guys go down.
Good guys... friends.
And for what?
I was on a wmd squad, the whole reason we were there, except we didn't find shit, did we?
Hmm.
So then I get home, i started listening to Dallas wolf.
Oh, yeah?
Dallas and I go way back.
Oh, there's a guy I'd love to meet, you know.
He's somebody who's telling the truth.
He's out there, he's asking why were we there?
And the answer's always the same.
Iraq, 9/11, osama bin laden, what does it all come back to?
Look at every war we've ever been in.
How many white men slaughtered their brothers in world war ii?
What, like a 100 million?
And for who?
Who's always pulling the strings?
It's all here in front of us.
But most people are blind.
Look at this bottle.
You see anything funny?
You're talking about the Jew tax?
What's the Jew tax?
Tell 'em, Nate.
Start looking at the food you buy, and you'll see this little "u."
The union of orthodox rabbis gets paid to perform a "blessing" on everything in the grocery store.
For this "blessing," they rake in billions of dollars in taxes.
We can't control the ketchup, but we can control the streets.
That's how it went down in Germany.
And we think of ourselves as a sturm abteilung.
We are a thinking man's soldiers.
First here.
And then here.
And that is where the revolution starts.
We're not these tired old kkk guys, waiting for some catastrophe to start a race war.
- We're the catastrophe.
- That's fucking right.
And we need guys like you, with military backgrounds.
We need best practices in our security.
Come on, man, I think our fucking security is pretty good.
Well, always room to improve, though, right?
Oh, yeah?
Like what?
Well, like, look at the position of this booth and then tell me, without looking, where the nearest exits are.
- What's your point?
- The point is, of all the large booths in this restaurant, you picked the one farthest from the exits.
If something goes down, we're fucked.
No, we're ready for whatever goes down.
Yeah, with only you and him, i don't know your name yet, I'm sorry, carrying?
Oh, and how the fuck you think you know that?
When you pat someone down so they're facing everybody's lap, it's pretty easy to tell.
You spend three years in Iraq, you learn how to scan a room.
And see threats.
Well, isn't that fucking impressive.
Now I only got one question for you.
What?
Why are you wearing levis?
Levis?
Your fucking Jew jeans?
Yeah, no, sorry, i just couldn't help notice when I was patting' you down.
While you were doing your little detective work all up in everybody's lap.
So why are you wearing them?
Because when i got home from Iraq, my brother gave me these jeans... as a homecoming gift.
Now, does he understand the struggle we're in?
No.
But I'm sure as shit not gonna let a zionist conglomerate keep me from wearing them.
You wanna boycott the Jews?
You ever look at the fortune 500?
You'll be living in a fucking cave.
He's right.
Shit, they probably own this place, too.
Frank tells me you run a medical supply company now?
Yeah.
Yeah, my military contacts helped me set up.
We're just starting out, but we got access to a lot of stuff.
That's great.
I'd love to talk to you about that sometime.
Yeah... anytime.
You know, when I was 13, i actually played soccer.
One day, I came into the locker room, right?
And there were these six niggers, and they had this friend of mine, this Irish kid, down in the stalls, right?
His head was up against the toilet, and his face was just covered,
I mean, covered in blood, like flaps of skin.
I'd never seen anyone get beaten like that.
And when I came in, they just stared at me.
They stared, and I...
I walked away...
And just left him.
I hated those motherfuckers.
Yeah, when I was your age, i got pushed around a lot.
- Yeah?
- It fucking sucks.
But you can use that.
Yeah, but with these guys, nobody can do shit to me.
I learned to be proud.
Strong!
- Yeah, but-- - to be an Aryan fucking warrior!
Isn't that right, Johnny?
All right, so what, are we gonna stand around all night
- or we gonna get fucking drunk!
- Let's go!
Come on, junior, let's get some fucking beer, motherfucker!
Come on, boy!
Get in there, boy!
Hey, Nate, you know what, man?
Everybody seems to really fucking like you.
Yeah.
Thisismy friendNate Iwastellingyou about.
Hey,everybody.
14/88,brother.
Goodtomeetyou .

Somethingbigis happening.
Inthebeginningwas the word.
Bearmedandbeready.
- Hey!
- Hey.
What's the matter, man?
You didn't hear me?
I just... uh...
You sleep well?
What's wrong?
Oh, yeah, no, we know where you live.
- Yup.
- Right.
Cool.
Yeah, so, what, you're not gonna invite us in?
Yeah, come on in.
Oh, thanks, man, so sweet of you.
It's a mess, sorry.
Welcome.
You mind?
Yeah, it's a cool place, man.
Yeah, but it kind of looks like you just moved in.
So, what are you guys doing here?
Aw, don't break my heart.
What are we doing here?
Come on, don't make it sound like you're not happy to see me.
See Vince is outside.
He's got a little surprise for you.
Oh, hey, well, um...
Yeah, well, I'm ready.
Let's go.
You're gonna be psyched, man!
It's fucking awesome!
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Cool, well, I'm good to go.
Let's head out.
- Let's go, Roy.
- What's the rush?
I'm coming.
What the fuck?
What the fuck is that?
Goddamn, man, you got some fucking shitty-ass furniture up in here, huh?
Yep.
Cheap as shit.
- All right, you ready?
- Yeah, I'm ready.
Sieg heil, motherfucker, let's go.
Sieg fucking hell.
Youdidn't finishyourtranscript.
Yeah,I know,I'llget toit.
Lookatmy fuckingarm !
Andwhatthefuck isgoingon withthisguyRoy?
You make him look small, you make him into an enemy.
Sometimes, Angela, it would just be great to hear, "good job."
I'm only so hard on you because I'm trying to protect you.
You have to remember your objective here.
This is about getting to Dallas wolf.
So what do I do about that?
Try relating to these guys as human beings.
You know?
Open up to them, if you can.
You may have more in common with them than you think.
Man, why the fuck does Vince make us come to this shit?
"Good networking, lots of movement guys." I mean, who gives a fuck?
Well, is Dallas wolf gonna be here?
Who the fuck knows?
I don't listen to that talk radio bullshit.
Fuck!
Goddamn.
Hey, that looks good on you, man.
Yeah, thanks.
Um, just go in,
I got another shirt in the cargo.
Hi, you must be Vince's friend Nate!
- I'm Becky, Gerry's wife.
- Oh, hi, nice to meet you.
- Such a pleasure to have you.
- Thank you for having me.
Yeah, of course.
Hey, Nate, i made some cupcakes.
The frosting is a little messed up, but they taste good.
So,Dallas,we wanted...
Nate!
Come check this out.
Isittrue, thisDallaswolfunityrally isthelargestevent you'vehostedin years?
Absolutely.
We'vebroughttogether thebiggestwhiteseparatist organizations in the northeast.

Notonlythat.
They'rebusingin hundreds of protestors from the DC area.
ButallIcan say is, theaflbetterbecareful.
Because while we come in peace, we'recertainly notafraidof war.
Fuck.
Yeah.
God, that's the first I'm hearing about this rally.
I mean, god knows you can't get any real news on the yidivision, but still...
Are you planning on going, Nathan?
And this is Andrew Blackwell from the Aryan alliance.
- Hail victory, brother.
- Hail victory.
The Aryan alliance, huh?
I've read a lot about you guys.
Well, we're the premiere white nationalist group in the world, so that's not surprising.
Earnest walton, grand dragon, good to meet you.
Good to meet you.
Earnest is with the local klan.
Yeah, you should stop by one of our meetings.
- We'd love to have you.
-
- Oh, wow.
You should check out our website, too.
We're always looking for quality people.
Ah, I don't think Nate's into all that religious stuff.
Excuse me?
Religious stuff?
I just think Nate is a little more rational than that.
I'm not sure I know what you mean by that.
Come on, Nate.
Let's go back and get some food.
Stay away from those faggots.
They got this fucked up religion where they think the Bible was written for white men and aryans are the lost tribes of Israel.
The Bible.
Jews invented christianity.
Jews invented the printing press, and the Bible is the most published book in the world.
I mean, anything seem off to you?
How about the fact the romans conquered every mud race on earth, and then christianity finished them off in a hundred years?
You gotta know who to stick with in this movement.
You're with us.
Goddamn it, Vince, every time we come here, the whole fuckin' place is dry!
- What the fuck, man?
- It's two hours, be good.
Gerry, there's somebody I want you to meet.
This is Nate.
- Hey, Gerry Conway.
- Nate Thomas, nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.
Vince told me all about you.
Make yourself at home.
I am throwing on some veggie burgers.
Thanks for having us.
- Hi!
- Hey, hey, I'm Nate.
- Madeline.
Nice to meet you.
- Hey, Madeline.
- This is Timmy.
- Hey, Timmy.
You want to come see our tree house?
Uh, yeah, sure, where are we going?
Oh, right, yeah, there.
Oh, wow, that is great!
Did your dad build this?
- I built it!
- You built this?
- But my daddy helped.
- Okay.
Wow.
- It's to protect us.
- Yeah, from what?
If the mud people come.
Always be ready.
Always be watchful and stick together.
You guys kidnapping my guest?
- Huh?
Huh?
This is amazing, man.
Well, I've always been good with my hands.
And it was just wonderful to have a project with the kids.
You know how you spell love, Nate?
T-i-m-e.
Ninety percent of the time you'll ever spend with your kids
- comes before the age of 12.
- Wow.
Yeah.
You been in the movement long, Nate?
Um, not long.
Just since i got back from Iraq.
Oh, yeah, right.
Yeah, Vince told me you served.
- Mm-hm.
- Mm-hm.
Hey, Nate, don't take this the wrong way but you kind of seem a little mature for a skinhead.
Really?
Yeah.
Yeah, maybe.
I don't know.
Um, what about you?
You seem to know a lot of people in this movement.
Ah, they probably come for the free food.
Ah, no.
You have these barbecues often?
Yeah, as much as I can, yes, you know,
I try to create a positive environment for everybody in the community, and a place for us to come together and be healthy in body and spirit.
"Fuck you, bitch!" And he turned around, and he's like-- guys!
Guys!
Language, please.
Kids.
Jesus fucking Christ.
It makes me so sad to see those two.
They gotta clean up their act.
Well, how do you mean?
Well, the cigarettes, and alcohol, the language.
This is what's happening to our young Aryan men.
Yeah.
To be honest, now that I met you,
I'm kind of surprised you invited those guys.
Well, you can't exclude them.
I mean, they're the next generation.
They need our help.
Need to understand their heritage, and be proud of it.
That's what it's all about, isn't it?
The children.
What kind of a world will they grow up in?
Goddamn, man, that was the worst fucking party on earth.
Jesus Christ, what kind of bullshit vodka is this, man?
Man, that's the last time i ever let you pick it out.
Man, look at that shit.
Look at that!
That is just fucking...
God, that is so fucking awful!
Man, look at that, look at that beautiful Aryan woman and that fucking...
Roy, come on, let's go the fuck home.
No, no, man, we're gonna teach these two a lesson.
- No!
- Get your fucking hands off of me!
Don't you ever fucking touch me again.
You hear me?
We're Aryan warriors, right?
That means we got a responsibility to do something about shit like this.
Hey, you two!
You need to get the fuck out of here!
Hold on, what did you say?
I said, get the fuck out of here or we're gonna kill you, you fucking spic!
What the fuck is your problem?
- What's our problem?
-
- Yeah.
You come into our country, you fuck our women.
Yeah, you got some big fucking balls, huh?
- Put the fucking knife down and calm down, all right, man?
- Oh, my god!
They get the point.
You thought you were a big man, huh?
He gets it, Roy!
He's fucking shaking.
I thought you were a big man.
- Put the fucking knife down!
- Fuck you, motherfucker!
I'll fucking gut you, you piece of shit!
Now go, fucker!
- Come on, let's go!
- Shit!
Fuck, Nate.
Goddamn it!
You're fucking lucky!
What the fuck is your problem?
You fucked the whole thing up!
Yeah, I think they got the message, Roy!
Got the message?
Are you a fucking idiot?
Man, those two were mine!
And then your dumb fucking ass decides...
Hang on, wait a minute...
First you tried to stop me, then you try to scare them off, and then you set off that fucking alarm.
That wasn't an accident, was it?
Was it, Nate?
You wanted them to get away.
What the fuck, Nate?
Huh?
I said what the fuck?
Okay, you're goddamn right i wanted them to get away!
You want to be a soldier, Roy and not a fucking thug?
Then think!
You think about security cameras, Roy?
You think about the liquor store we were just in?
You think about the clerk or the license plates on my fucking truck?
You think about any of that shit?
Fucking Aryan warrior...
A hundred spics and niggers ain't worth the life of one white man, but go ahead, put us all in prison.
That's how you're gonna win your race war?
Huh?
Fuck!
All right, whatever, can we just get back on the road and get the fuck out of here?
Fuck!
Iranthoselicenseplates.
Anaccountant,aschool teacher,a lawyer,fireman, he'sanengineer, not a criminal record in sight, butAndrewBlackwell, he'sa differentstory.
Whyishe here?
Uh, he said he was going to wolf's rally.
He's the national director of the Aryan alliance.
They're based in Ohio, he wouldn't just come all this way to be in a rally.
Wait, if wolf is involved in this, he can't be doing it alone, right?
I mean, he'd need help, and organization.
Exactly, so you need to figure out how wolf and Blackwell are connected, and why he's really here.
Vince, good to see you.
Rich, can we get some literature, please?
- White power.
- White power.
Okay, we're gettin' ready to get started here.
Can everyone take a seat?
MosttimesI'dtalkedtoyou,
Ifocuson oursurvival, theterriblestruggle tosaveourpeople beforetheyarelostforever.
Butwhataboutthe future?

I'lltellyou.
It will be a world like the one that shaped our race in Europe.
Aworldof forests, mountains,andlakes.
Nota worldof concrete, asphalt,andgarbage.
Andinsteadof 300million race-lessmulattos, breedingandinfesting.
Imaginea continent of50millionwhiteEuropeans.

That'stheworldIsee.

That'sthenation wecanbuild...together.
If you take millions of white people, and flood every country in Africa with them, what do they call that?
Genocide.
But what's happening to every white country on earth?
You've got affirmative action that kills white jobs.
Abortion, that kills white babies.
Gay rights, that kill white families.
Folks, let me explain something to you.
"Diversity" is a code word.
And what it means is white genocide!
So, we'll begin marching at the courthouse.
And after two blocks-- wait a minute, wait a minute.
This is not the order that we agreed to.
Aryan alliance is supposed to be heading this march.
Now just a second, Andrew.
You know, we're at this rally every year, and we start with the colonial patriots.
Well, this isn't "every year," is it?
To be fair, Harris, maybe we should.
You're a local organization...
Vince, can you introduce me to Dallas?
"The klan"?
You're not "the klan."
Yeah, sure.
Come on, let's go.
You're the "invisible white knights" of the ku klux klan!
Which is what, the third klan group in the DC Metro area?
!
Hey, Dallas!
Good to see you.
It's... it's Vince, Vince sargent?
Right, Vince.
Good to see you.
Good to see you.
I want to introduce you to my good friend, this is Nate Thomas.
- I'm a huge fan of your show.
- Thank you, sir.
If you'll excuse me.
I have to get ready for the march.
- Uh, Mr. wolf?
- Yes, what is it?
I didn't want to get into this in front of Vince, but I'd like to talk to you about an investment.
- An "investment"?
- Mm-hm.
I represent a few people who are big fans of yours, and they want to help.
- Is that so?
- Yes, sir.
They have a number of assets in the online media space, and they feel the potential for your show is being limited by your advertising budget.
They want to help you penetrate some new markets, and they see no reason why you can't go nationwide.
Well, that is great, son.
That is just great.
Here, call this number and we'll talk.
Okay, great.
That sounds great, Mr. wolf.
- Call me, Dallas.
- Thank you.

Johnny!
Hey, man, just fucking stay back, okay?
- Don't fucking do it.

Help him by not getting the fuck arrested, okay?
- Fucking pussies!

- White Nazi scum!
Yeah, you know what?
I can do that shit, too.

You okay?
Everyone okay?
Sorry.
Okay.
Stay with us.
I'm getting you out of here, man.
Go... go right, go right!
Oh, fuck!
- Fuck!
- Fucking...
Holy shit!
We gotta go!
We gotta fucking go!
I can't fucking go anywhere!
Stay down!
Fuck!
No, don't get up.
You need to rest.
I brought you some chamomile tea.
It'll help you relax.
Thank you.
There's our wounded warrior.
How you feeling, buddy?
Yeah, much better.
Thank you, guys.
Ah, no problem.
I'm gonna put some music on.
I brought you Sammy to keep you company.
Thanks.
Oh, wow.
You like it?
I...
I love brahms.
See, Becky, i knew he was quality.
I think the fourth is my favorite.
Yeah, mine, too.
Except maybe the-- the first?
Yeah.
Now listen, if you like brahms,
I've got this clarinet quintet that will blow your mind.
They're dead, Gerry.
Dead.
I'm gonna find them, and we're gonna string them up-- alright, I hear ya.
I hear ya.
That's why I avoid the political stuff.
Not my thing.
Besides, I've heard it can be dangerous.
That was fantastic.
Thank you...
I thought you guys were vegetarians.
Everybody's gotta have a few vices every now and then.
What's "vices"?
Oh, boy, there we go!
I'm sorry about that, that's my ride.
Gerry, Becky, thanks for everything.
Nathan, I don't know what to say.
I owe you, big time.
Why don't you stop by the compound some time.
Oh, I'm not really in Ohio that much, but I'd love to if I ever am.
No, I meant the...
The new one.
- Oh.
- Here in Virginia.
Oh, right, yeah, please, I'd love to.
- Bye.
- Have a good night.
Bye, Andrew!
Well, listen, you're not going to believe it, but when it comes to tchaikovsky...
Gotta go with Bernstein.
- Leonard Bernstein?
- I know, I know.
Gerry, I hate to break it to you, man--
I know.
Listen, I can't help it, he's a great conductor.
Jews listen to Wagner, don't they?
So, Gerry, if you don't mind my asking, how did you end up in the movement?
Listen, for me, it was the books.
My parents were practically liberals.
Totally blinded by the zog.
You know, I always knew something was wrong;
and I had this anger,
I couldn't put my finger on it, until here.
It all started with this.
I was 13.
Read it in four days.
It explains race, culture, capitalism and how democracy destroyed western civilization.
Democracy:
"Three people form a government.
Then two of them vote to steal the wealth of the third."
- David Lane, right?
- Mm-hm.
Now here's something more recent.
You'll love this.
This breaks down the entire worldwide zionist conspiracy, step by step.
- You can bring it back.
- Oh, no, I couldn't.
Nate, Nate, please.
But that was it?
I mean, it was just books woke you up?
Well, you know, i had my theories.
And then a three-month engineering contract opened up in Kenya.
I was young, i wanted to see the world.
And, uh, Nate, listen,
I got no problem with them having their own country, everybody should.
But if you go there, and you see, they weren't even living like animals.
You know, animals don't live in their own feces, do they?
So, if you ever have any doubt white men created civilization, just go have a look.
Hey.
So,howwasthe brahms?
Howdoyoureason withsomeonelikethat?
Howcanyoueverhope tochangetheirmind?
Listen,youneedtorememberwhyyou're doingthis.
We'renotsocialworkers.
Youwantedme to relate to them as human beings, right?
"Openupto them?"You said.
...theyweren'teven livinglikeanimals.
Youwantto getadrink?
Wherearewe gonnago andgetadrink?
This suspect, he was a fucking nightmare.
He was grabbing my ass, the whole thing.
And he kept insisting i go to this club with him, where I knew he was gonna make his big move, but if I didn't go, then, you know, I could blow my whole cover.
So what did you do?
So we're at a bar, and I tell him I want oysters.
So I get a dozen, i start plowing through them.
Then I start acting queasy.
I run to the bathroom, stick my finger down my throat.
- No way!
- Yeah!
So now there's puke all over my dress,
I tell him I got sick off the oysters and take a cab home.
Two days later, he was arrested.
- That is fucking awesome.
- Oh, it was fucked up.
But there was the thrill, you know?
That high.
God, there's nothing like it.
Yeah, so why'd you stop?
It was just it's no way to live, the paranoia, the tension.
And I wanted to spend more time with my kids.
You got kids?
You don't think I'm mommy material?
No, no... no.
Yeah, I got two princesses.
Mommy and daddy.
Perfect, little suburban life.
Anyway, I know how lonely this work can be.
But the case won't go forever.
You can't change the way people think, but you are making a difference.
Nathan, good to see you.
Can we get you anything, coffee?
Oh, no, I'm good, thanks.
This is a great set-up you got here.
Yeah, thanks.
All right, let's give you the tour.
This parcel is actually pretty small, but we're purchasing the one next to it.
Although, citizen's groups are trying to block us out.
Oh, yeah.
How are you handling that?
Well, we tell them we're here to stay.
Make no mistake about it.
We show up at their homes, their businesses, their churches.
They backed down pretty quick after that.
So you're moving the national headquarters?
No, we're keeping the compound in Ohio, it's just with everything going on right now, we needed a stronger presence here.
You know?
- Is that your firing range?
- Yeah, come on.
It's a little primitive, but we're working on it.
I'm no marksman, by any means, but I have some expertise in range design, just from training the Iraqi police.
What's your danger area template?
To contain your cone of fire.
I mean, how do you control your overshoot?
Uh...
We haven't gotten to that yet.
Okay, well, you might want to make sure it's the kikes and niggers getting hit and not your guys.
Absolutely.
Maybe if you have time,
- you could talk to the guys about it.
- Yeah, sure,
I need to see what kind of equipment you've got, but I'm happy to.
Okay.
Uh, come on up here.
Right now were just using this for storage.
- Are those cots?
- Yup.
We'll be able to sleep 200 in there.
And we're gonna need to.
I'm not gonna beat around the bush.
You see the type of organization we have here, but we could always use a man like you, Nathan.
Educated, war veteran, clean record.
I mean, hell, you don't even have any parking tickets.
Yeah, we have our contacts in law enforcement, local, state, federal, not to mention military hospitals, laboratories, you name it.
And so what's the overall objective here?
I mean, are you just trying to get the message out, or what?
Get the... get the message out?
To who?
We're not trying to recruit the public here.
What would we do with them?
They're at home sitting on their asses,
- watching sitcoms and surfing Facebook.
This is revolutionary activity we're talking about here.
Look, I'm flattered by the interest, but, you know,
I've been around the movement awhile now and a lot of these guys are all talk.
Now for me to really want to get involved,
I need to know there's bigger things going on here.
No offense.
Yeah... none taken.
All right...
Take a look at this.
This is the entire DC water system.
Plants, pipelines, the whole deal.
Now, Nathan, the guys you're hanging out with, they're all talk, because they're punks.
They're amateurs.
They sit around drinking beer all day, maybe they beat up a few niggers or each other.
We got no use for them.
We need men like you.
Can I help you?
I'm looking for Dallas wolf, but I must have the wrong house.
Oh, no, he's here.
Come in.
Randy!
Someone's here!
Hey, Nate.
The studio's back here.
I'm moving studios right now, so this is all temporary.
Oh, no, this is a great setup.
Thanks for taking the time to see me, Dallas.
I just spent the afternoon with Andrew at the Aryan alliance.
Oh, yeah?
Andrew's great.
They have an incredible organization.
Yeah, they seem really serious about the struggle.
About doing whatever it takes.
They're true patriots, those guys.
Well, let me give you a bit of background on me.
I was in Iraq for three years, on a wmd squad.
And then when I got back, my military contacts helped me set up a medical supply company.
V-a-l-e.
Wow, this is great.
Yeah, we do it all, from bandages and syringes to X-ray and radiotherapy equipment.
And with the highly regulated stuff, we can cut through a lot of the red tape and deal directly, and discreetly.
Fantastic, Nate.
Great to know.
So... you'd also mentioned an investment?
For the show?
Yes, I've got an investor lined up who's very excited about expanding your reach.
We're talking advertising, marketing, bigger servers...
That's exactly what I need.
So how do I meet him?
Well, a lot of my military contacts don't like to publicize their efforts.
But he'd love for you to put together a proposal about how you'd expand the show.
Funny you should mention that.
I've been trying to raise $7,500 to break into the Florida market.
They're ripe right now, with all the immigration stuff.
Yeah... yeah, this is great!
So, there's one more thing.
Go ahead, shoot.
The reason he's helping you is because he feels that you are a man of action, as he is.
As I am.
Right, sure.
So for him to move forward, he needs to know you're serious about this.
Nate, I've been ready to give my life for this cause for 20 years now.
What I need is the right people behind me.
So you tell your investor that if he wants action, he's got the right guy.
Um, sorry, Dallas, I've got kind of a long drive back, you mind if I hit the head?
The whole case is about to blow wide open!
He's in with wolf, he's in with the Aryan alliance.
Yeah, and all we need to keep wolf on the line is that $7,500!
Let me get this straight.
So after everything we spent on your cover, even after the medical supply business, you want me to ask for $7,500 asan"investment" inthisguy'sradioshow ?
You're the only one with a budget right now!
Oh, yeah, I'm just flush with cash!
I'm trying to run a 40-man investigation ontopof allthe shit I'vealreadygot!
Sir, the alliance is building a compound outside DC.
Wolf's house is setting off a geiger counter!
I spent six hours last night reading your transcripts,
Nate, you don't have shit!
Youdon'thaveshit!
Look at how much carbon is built up on this bolt.
- See?
See that?
Like-- - yeah.
That's unacceptable.
When's the last time you cleaned this?
I've been meaning to get to most of them.
Okay, guys, seriously!
Okay, so we got an ar-15, serial number a00724, needs a new buffer spring.
Come on, guys, let's go!
We need to go through the whole inventory.
Andrew's waiting on this.
I'm gonna have to tell Andrew, the only way it's gonna change is with new policies.
And how do I know it's not me you're trying to fuck?
Fuck you, you calling us liars?
You get on the phone yourself!
Call them up and ask them...
Hey, guys...
Hey, Nate...
It's been a while.
Yeah, you kinda disappeared on us.
I'm sorry about that, Vince.
I've been kind of busy.
Yeah, I bet you have.
Seems like you made a bunch of new friends around here, huh?
See, we were just wondering if maybe you could explain--
Roy!
Thanks for stopping by.
Be seeing you, Nate.
What was that all about?
Roy says the police have been following him.
He's paranoid about infiltrators.
Infiltrators, huh?
Yeah.
Mm.
That's why the police are on his ass?
Have you seen how that guy behaves?
It's a miracle he's not in jail already.
Right, uh, you want to help us with something?
Sure, what's up?
I'm throwing a youth event for Hitler's birthday.
There's a campground a couple miles from here.
- Help us scout it.
- Sounds good.
It's amazing how much land there is right outside DC.
Let me ask you something, Nathan.
What's your opinion on infiltration?
Well, how do you mean?
How do we prevent it?
Well, it's tough.
For one thing, you gotta keep guys with rap sheets out of important positions.
That's... that's how they flip most people.
We have a polygraph back at the compound.
Maybe we should make everybody take it.
I mean, i think someone who's trained can beat a polygraph without blinking.
Yeah, maybe we should just do a background checks for everybody.
Get everyone's records and documents together?
Yeah, I mean, for informants, that might work.
But for law enforcement, they just forge whatever they need.
Yeah, but with a few phone calls, you know, a cover only runs so deep.
Do you suspect someone?
You know, it's like they say at these rallies.
You look to the left, look to the right, one of these people is a snitch.
It's the left.
Turn left right up here.
You okay there, Nate?
You look a little off?
No, I'm good.
Just, uh, tired...
Been a long day.
Well, I think this is a great location.
What do you think?
Yeah, I like it.
Uh, well, what about the permits, though?
We tell them we're a Christian organization, holding a youth event.
I gotta ask you something.
Roy said he contacted the nprc.
Said there's no record of you having served in the marines.
You mean Roy went and filed a 180 with a government that he fucking hates, just to... okay.
I was on a wmd squad, so that's black ops.
And he knows that, the fucker.
Wait, hold on, are you guys taking this seriously?
Is that what that was all about in the truck?
Because, I understand you have to do your due diligence or whatever, but that's a fucking serious accusation!
I don't need to take that shit from anybody!
- Hey... hey, hey!
- Least of all from--
okay.
Let's get out of here.
Nate,listen.
Weneedtogettheserial numbers first,andthen- - no, look, I don't have time for that!
What if he wasn't convinced?
What if he calls wolf?
The account name is Nate foster, please.
You don't know if he was convinced!
You don't even know if they talk, okay?
You're being-- yeah, I'd like $7,500 in cash.
You're a man of your word, which is a rare thing in this movement.
So, listen, Dallas, my investor is very excited, but he wants to know some more about what you're planning, some details.
Oh, okay, I think it was all in the presentation, but we start with online in tampa, and then we move down the- no, no, I mean, beyond that.
- Beyond Florida?
Beyond the show, like what we talked about.
The actions we're gonna take.
I'm sorry, Nate.
I lost you.
What do you mean?
What I mean is, you have been talking a lot about a lot of big things that are coming.
Bigger than Oklahoma city, bigger than 9/11-- oh, yeah, for sure.
Which is why expanding the show is so important.
Right, and I have been spending a lot of time with Andrew at the Aryan alliance.
He told me you'd been working together.
Well, yeah, sure, i mean, he came to the rally.
No, no, what my investor needs to know is what are the concrete steps that you are taking to start the race war.
As I said to you before,
I have the expertise, the connections, the tools.
Maybe there's some kind of misunderstanding.
I thought we were talking about expanding the show.
Yeah, which my investor is happy to do, but if you're not willing to be honest about the other actions you're taking, then he's not gonna be able to support you.
Okay, Nate, fair enough.
Sorry it didn't work out.
I saw the plans, Dallas, for the water system.
Andrew showed them to me, okay?
So, I know all about it, and now I just need you to stop pretending and be honest with me.
This is private property.
You're no longer welcome here.
I'm asking you to leave.
Come on, Dallas.
I'm on your side.
Get the fuck out.
Now.
Fuck.
We'regoingto theoffice,
Dallaswolfis there.
Youbroughthimin?
No.
Hecametous.
Sir.
I didn't know you'd be here.
Has anyone talked to him?
No, no, of course not.
No, it's your show.
So, Dallas.
Or should I call you Randy?
That is your real name.
You can call me whatever you like, agent zamparo.
Any reason you're using an assumed name?
I'm a public entertainer.
Ah... fine.
So, tell me why you're here today.
I'm here because of the guy I called about.
He shows up at my conference, talking about investing in my show.
Butthen,he 'stellingme howhecanget highlyregulateditems.

That's a lot.

Right.
Let me play you something, okay, Randy.
Ihaveinformation abouta truckaccident outsideDClastnight, involvingclassified radioactivematerial, butnowtheFBI istrying tocoverit allup.
Why ?
You've gotta be kidding me.
It's a radio show.
It's entertainment!
So you think it's entertaining to predict and incite terrorist attacks?
Whether I think it's entertaining is irrelevant.
Why don't you talk to somebody around here who knows something about the law, preferably a man!
Brandenburgvs.Ohio,1969, itisnotillegal toadvocateviolence.
Thefirstamendment doesn't protect people who have knowledgeofan actualcrime!
What knowledge of a crime do I have?
Well, why don't you tell me, Randy?
What is this accident?
What is this FBI cover-up?
Why are you living at an unregistered address?
And why is that location lighting up a geiger counter?
You've been following me?
You've been casing my house?
Why don't you answer my questions?
Letmeshowyou something.

- Now, tom, look...
- Now, tom, look, what?
Really, what could you possibly have to say?
Because this is a fucking disaster!
I warned you, i tried to tell you.
- We still might have a weapons case!
- We ran those serial numbers.
Every single one of those guns is legally registered.
Every one!
Okay, so you think there's nothing to any of this?
Right?
The prepaid cellphones?
The barracks for 200 guys?
- The water system plans?
- They're conspiracy theorists!
It's all talk!
He keeps those plans around to trot out when he wants to act like a big shot!
What are they gonna do, they're gonna put radioactive material in the water supply?
That doesn't make any fucking sense!
You two, you pull this from here and that from there, and you're making up this whole big fucking story in your head, and it's bullshit!
You know, we see what we want to see!
Well, now you've compromised him, and you've compromised the bureau, and you've wasted all our fucking time!
This happens sometimes, you know?
- I mean, it sucks, but-- - "this happens"?
Is that all you're gonna fucking say after we find out all of this?
Everything you fucking put me through has been for nothing?
It's the nature of the work.
No!
This... this happened because of your pet theory!
And like an idiot, i went along with it!
"Oh, yeah, she's an expert," i thought.
"She knows what she's doing!"
I'm sorry, Nate.
Fucking why?
Why are you even sorry?
This has been great for you!
You got the thrill back!
You got the excitement you've been wanting, you got an escape from your little suburban life,
- by manipulating me!
- No, that is not fair!
I thought we had a case!
God, do you even know how many dead ends I've been down?
No, you fucking knew!
You knew I was so eager, so desperate to do something meaningful, to actually work on a real case in this place, that I would do anything you wanted, while you just sat back and enjoyed the ride!
Yeah.
Fuck!
Nate!
Hey, good to see you!
I've been calling you!
Yeah, I know, I'm sorry about that, I've been really busy.
I just wanted to return these.
I'm heading out of town for a couple of months, gonna work on setting up the business on the west coast.
Oh, wow, wow, well, please come in.
Uh, that's nice of you, but I don't think I can.
Aw, come on, just for a cup of tea?
Is everything okay, Nate?
Yeah, yeah, why do you ask?
Well, you said you're headed out west.
Yeah, I'm gonna work on setting up the business on the west coast.
Right.
God, it's hard to find what we're looking for in life.
But then, I listen to something like that.
One man made something...
That will make millions, maybe billions of people feel the way we just did.
We all have that power, Nate.
All of us.
Honestly...
I used to feel that way, Gerry.
I always felt like i could change the world.
You know, I could right wrongs, you know, fight injustice.
Nate, listen, it's guys like us that feel these things the most.
Idealists.
Yeah, I just keep thinking about that quote.
"For evil to triumph, it only takes good men to do nothing."
But how?
You know, fucking how?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Gerry, i shouldn't be...
- It's all right.
- I'm just really tired.
You know, Nate, maybe you're going about this the wrong way.
The rallies, the speeches, the politics...
That's not how the change is gonna come.
It's gonna come from the unknown soldiers, from the leaderless resistance.
How do you mean?
Let's go out back.
I made some improvements to the tree house.
Talking frankly is something we have to be very careful about.
- Something we always do outdoors.
- Right, of course.
You know, I've thinking about this for a long time, Nate, years really.
What's needed is an event.
What kind of event?
An event that wakes people up.
They're sleepwalkers out there.
They're blind.
Think about this regime.
Media brainwashing, secret courts, mass surveillance, waco, Ruby Ridge.
Using Katrina and 9/11 to set up "refugee camps," or "detention camps", in other words, concentration camps, because who cares about the rights of a few arabs, niggers and racists, if it makes us safer?
Right?
That's how it all starts.
All the lies that the zionists tell about Nazi Germany, that's what's actually happening right now!
The irony of it!
Right?
That's why we gotta be smart.
That's why the event has to force the zog to show its hand.
It's gotta reveal the men behind the curtain.
Because it's not the event that wakes people up, it's the reaction to the event.
Yes!
Yes, you get it!
Yeah, look at the sons of Liberty.
Look at the ira.
That is how you start a revolution.
Yeah, yeah, I always felt this kinship with you, Nate.
And...
I wanted to talk openly with you, but I just haven't known you that long, but I know in my heart, i can trust you.
You can.
You can, Gerry, i want to help.
I want to make a difference.
Okay.
I still got connections from my Africa days.
Okay, and we have the means to create that kind of event.
But, Nate, if you get involved we may not live to see the world we're building.
But I'll have helped to build it.
A man's body dies, but his deeds live forever.
There's a way you can help us.
- Okay, yeah.
- Come here.
We need to talk to the s.A.C., now!
Oh, my lord, who the hell wrapped it?
You guys aren't trying to give it a bath!
Oh, hey, guys!
Sorry abut that, just having some technical difficulties over here.
- No problem!
- Be right over...
- Okay, one, two...
- Hey, Morgan, David...
I want you to meet somebody.
This is Nate.
Morgan, good to meet you.
- Greetings, sir.
I'm David.
- Hey, you guys.
So is the wedding out here?
Yeah, it's right over here.
It's beautiful, isn't it?
Wait till we see it all lit up.
Pure of spirit and pure of race, these two souls commit themselves to the defense and prosperity of their sacred blood.
May their sons and daughters fill this land, forever honoring their duty to folk, kindred, soil, and honor.
Iknowyouguys don'tknowNatethatwell .
But he's a good man and he's a good soldier.
If you trust me, you can trust him.
No luck yet.
No one wants to sell to an anonymous buyer.
If we give up that prepaid phone crap, i use my real name,
I got three guys i can get it from right now.
If we do it the morning of-- yeah, I thought we were at least trying to do this without getting caught?
Guys, guys, shh.
Nate has a potential solution for us.
Tatp.
It's much better than ammonium nitrate anyway.
A smaller quantity will give you a much bigger blast.
Yeah, well, sure, but where are we gonna get that?
I run a medical supply company.
And you're gonna get tatp?
I know it's not the easiest thing, but I've got some connections.
I can make a few calls and loop back with Gerry.
Assuming I can, what are we gonna do about the cesium powder itself?
Ready when we need it.
No, I mean, how are we going to handle it?
Well we've got heavy gloves, and we've got goggles.
No... radioactive particles will pass through those as easy as anything else, including your skin.
- Well, what do you suggest?
- I think we need suits.
They'll be pretty bulky, but we only need to wear them when the powder's out in the open.
When do we need them by?
Well, we've just been waiting for the explosive.
If you can get the tatp, Sunday is our day.
You guys remember Timothy McVeigh's last words?
Yeah, he read invictus.
"It matters not how strait the gait, how charged with punishments the scroll,
I am the master of my fate:
I am the captain of my soul."
Are you sure this is gonna look right?
Wow.
It looks great.
The secret is the smell.
Where's the bleach powder?
Oh, it's right over here.
And you're sure they're not gonna try and test this somehow?
Yeah, that's why terrorists love tatp.
You can't identify it without a mass spectrometer.
Okay, if you say so.
Yeah.
Uh-huh, yeah, I'm here now.
Sunday, so team's in place Friday night.
Look, can I just say
I'm sorry about what i said to you the other day.
I was exhausted.
Don't worry about it.
That's what this job does to you.
Keep at it another ten years and you'll turn into a real asshole...
like me.
It's totally secure.
We can keep everything in here, and then, on game day, we can use this space to put it all together.
Great, great.
This is great, Nate.
And here is the tatp.
- No problems, inquiries?
- Nope.
All good.
Morgan's a pharmacist.
All right.
Hm, these crystals seem a little small.
Smells about right.
Okay, let's test it.
Test it?
You got a mass spectrometer in your bag?
No, we'll just see if it burns.
What?
No, whoa, whoa!
Hold on, what do you mean?
Burn it?
What are you talking about?
Well, we use a sample, we set it a light.
It burns for a while before it explodes.
I saw it on YouTube.
Are you insane?
Do you know how dangerous this stuff is?
Hey, you are not the only one with experience!
This is a highly unstable substance, okay?
It's sensitive to heat, friction-- which is why I'll do the test carefully!
Now you want to see the video?
Because I have it here on my phone!
I don't give a shit about what's on your phone!
We are not lighting this stuff on fire!
You know how many bomb techs i saw get their faces blown off trying to deal with this stuff in Iraq?
I've worked with this company for two years!
They are not gonna send me a container full of baking soda, okay?
Gerry, this doesn't work for me, okay, if he doesn't trust me, or my suppliers-- we need to test the fucking stuff!
You don't fucking trust me or my suppliers, that is your problem!
You want to use ammonium nitrate, fine with me!
- Okay.
- Fine with me.
Nate, Nate, Nate.
It's all right.
It's fine, it's fine.
Morgan, Morgan, he's right.
Come on.
He's right.
So, can we see the suits?
And it's kind of hard with the gloves, but... and you zip that up and fasten along there.
You guys, what would be worse, radiation poisoning or wearing this thing around for a couple hours?
Yeah.
Soifyoueverhave anydoubt white men created civilization, justgohavealook .
Howdoyoureason withsomeonelikethat?
Howcanyoueverhope tochangetheirmind?
Hello?
Hey, hey, listen, something's wrong.
David drove to Frederick county earlythismorning andwentto afarmsupply.
Itlookslikehebought ammoniumnitrate.
And now they're all at Gerry's.
But it's Saturday?
And why do they need ammonium nitrate?
I don't know.
Me and Hernandez are heading over to meet the surveillance team at Gerry's now.
- What are you going to do?
- I don't know!
No!
No!
You can not raid them yet!
You don't even know if they have the cesium?
And Gerry's phone's off.
Okay, I have to go over there.
No,Nate!
It--
- What are you doing here?
- I was calling, you didn't answer.
I got worried.
- Bullshit!
Why are you here?
- I just told you!
I'm gonna give you one more chance.
Okay, what the fuck is wrong with this guy?
I called three times, you didn't answer any of them!
I got worried something happened to you!
All right, put it down!
He's telling the truth!
- Were you followed?
-
- No, I wasn't!
- Are you sure?
- Yes!
I was worried, so I was checking constantly!
Okay, calm down, everybody calm down.
Okay, can somebody tell me what is going on?
I sent David to do surveillance on your shop last night.
I saw an electrical crew go into the building across the street.
- So?
- In the middle of the night?
Could there be like a power problem?
No, they must have traced the tatp you ordered.
- Okay, if they're on to the shop...
- Fuck.
...they're on to you.
Are you sure you weren't followed?
- Yes!
- If he said he wasn't, he wasn't!
Stay calm and keep your eyes open.
Morgan, get back to work, please, Jesus.
We had to move forward, immediately.
It would have been only a matter of time before they were on to us, too.
And you weren't gonna let me know?
Nate, I'm sorry.
It's too risky.
Well, he's here now, let's get him to help!
What about the tatp?
David got ammonium nitrate instead.
He used his name, so the jig is up.
They'll know it's us.
It's not gonna matter tomorrow.
We're in this to the end now, Nate.
Do you understand?
They're not gonna take us alive.
All right, let me help.
Okay, okay, good.
Come over here.
I should go wash up so I don't contaminate anything.
Oh...
Hey, Nate!
How are you?
- Nate!
- The cesium is here!
All right, everyone!
Let's get ready to do this!
No!
Angela, you have to tell him to wait.
Wait?
No, no, no, we need to get in there now!
There are three guys in there with machine guns and they're building a bomb.
This is a residential neighborhood.
His wife and kids are in the house.
Ifyoucomeinhere now, it'llbeabloodbath .
This is a volatile situation.
Yeah, which is why we need to move now...
No, he doesn't get it!
These guys are fanatics!
They will not be taken alive!
Tom, you're not in there!
We have to listen to him.
And what the fuck happens if the explosives go off whilewe'rewaitingaround?
Nate,yougot60seconds todisarmthoseguys, becausewe'recomingin.
Okay, let's get these suits ready.
Okay, let's get ready to move!
We are almost done here!
Fuck!
The cesium spilled!
Shit, get the suits on!
Go, go, go!
Come on!
Come on, help me!
Help me!
Get zipped up!
Get zipped up!
Son of a...
Shit, come on!
- Come on, get your hood on!
- No!
No!
...stop!
Get the gun!
It's me!
It's me!
It's me!
Are you okay?
You all right?
- You all right?
- Yeah, no, I'm good, I'm good.
I know my rights!
I'm a patriot of the United States!
- Shut your fucking mouth!
- Fuck you!
Come on, get up!
Surprise!
Thepaperworkcamein...
Houston.
Yeah...
Texas.
Can you believe it?
Good margaritas, I hear.
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm gonna miss it here, though.
Well, "it's" going to miss you, too.
"This should have been a noble creature;
he hath all the energy which would have made a goodly frame of glorious elements, had they been wisely mingled."
Gerry?
Yeah, Gerry, and all of them, really.
Yeah, that's why you were the right guy for the job.
What do you mean?
Why do you think I picked you?
I knew that you would understand them.
And they'd understand you.
And the more authentic you became with them, the more authentic they'd become with you.
Because when it comes down to it, there really is only one essential ingredient to fascism.
It'svictimhood.
I blamed those black kids, and I blamed this school,
I blamed the cops;
I blamed everybody.
I was gonna hurt everyone else the way they hurt me.
I look at you guys and I see myself.
But you guys don't have to make the same mistakes I did.
You don't have to be victims.
Hey.
- Hey.
- Hey.
That was great.
Thanks.
Dude, thanks...
Thanks for coming by.
I'm so proud of you, Johnny.
You know what they say...
It all begins with the word.
[man] You have the phone?
[beeps]
[vehicle starts]
[man 1] Should I do it now?
[man 2] Not yet.
Wait until we get to the checkpoint.
Okay, guys, this is it.
Hey, Ivy League's gun, put that gun back away.
- What are you talking about?
- I don't need some egghead who just scored an 81 on his 'qual shooting my dick off, okay?
This is my fucking guy!
I'm not just gonna sit here while you...
Guys, enough!
Nate, just follow our lead, okay?
[man] ls your heart clear?
Are you sure you want to do this?
The signal will be better outside.
Here it is.
[dialing]
- Did it work?
- [all yelling indistinct]
- Drop it!
- Freeze!
Hands in the air!
- Turn around!
- Hands behind your back!
[officer] You have the right to remain silent, Usman.
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
You have the right to an attorney.
[man] Hello, Usman.
I can help you.
I can get you phone calls with your parents, your friends...
My parents?
!
I wish they were dead!
And I don't have any friends.
Oh, wow, he's a real prince, this one.
Can I get in there?
Salam alaikum.
What the fuck, Tom?
I have this room at 4:00!
I know you don't get a lot of news downstairs, Zamparo, but we just broke up a massive terrorist plot, all right?
Try and keep up.
[sobbing]
Urn...
What?
What is it?
Sir, when I flagged up this guy's email,
I thought the investigation was only gonna proceed if there was substantive criminal evidence to back it up.
We've got hours of him talking about waging jihad and killing children.
Right, but talking, though, sir, not...
he's not doing anything.
[Nate] Isn't that the point?
[chuckles]
Hey, Tim.
How's it going?
You celebrating something, Nate?
You seeing someone special, huh.
[soft chuckle]
Uh, yeah, actually.
How'd you guess?
[orchestral music plays]
- [music stops]
- Genius, emergency meeting in the conference room!
[laughing]
The crash was off 301 around 2:00 last night.
Local police controlled the scene, so, thankfully, the press knows nothing.
These containers carried cesium-137.
It's used for radiotherapy applications in hospitals, but, it's highly regulated and had no business being on that truck.
When we tracked the shipment back to Baltimore, [man] the customs record showed eight containers, not two.
So there's six more of them out there, all of them in the country illegally.
If that quantity made it's way into a radiological device, we could be looking at thousands of casualties, mass evacuations and radioactive contamination throughout the D.C. area.
Tom?
Uh...
lab analysis puts the cesium coming from North Africa.
So the guys on four, they put together this map.
It's an analysis of Muslim communities in D.C., Maryland and Virginia, along with their countries of origin.
What we'd like each and every... yes?
What about leads on the DT front?
Well, given the cesium came from North Africa, we don't think domestic is really in the picture.
The last time anyone tried to build a dirty bomb on US soil was James Cummings.
He was a white supremacist living in Maine, he was going to set it off at Obama's inauguration.
He had uranium, thorium, and he was trying to acquire cesium.
I'm sure you're familiar with the case.
It goes without saying, anyone here is welcome to pursue any leads they think are fruitful.
[orchestral music plays]
Okay, would you fucking stop...
- Oh, I'm so sorry.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- I'm Angela Zamparo.
- Nate Foster.
- I know.
You got a couple minutes?
[Zamparo] DT's downstairs.
There's only one perk to being down in this shithole.
Nicorette just isn't the same.
So, Nate...
you seem like you've got a bit more going on than most around here.
You remember Oklahoma City?
Well, yeah, I guess I was...
five but, sure.
What do you know about Timothy McVeigh?
He was... some kind of lone extremist...
in a militia?
Don't be an asshole who bullshits questions you don't know the answer to.
Here.
Timothy McVeigh was a decorated Gulf War veteran.
He was not insane.
He was not a lunatic.
And he was not stupid.
He was a white supremacist, following a plan.
What plan?
A plan from a book called The Turner Diaries.
It's about a "race war" to exterminate blacks, Jews, and "mud people."
You know how the war gets started?
The hero drives a truck bomb into a federal building.
Timothy McVeigh was reenacting that scene from The Turner Diaries.
He was carrying the book with him when he was arrested.
What he was trying to do was start the race war.
You're focused on the Islamic guys.
I get it.
We all create a narrative based on what we think is important.
We see what we want to see.
But just because you're not looking at something... doesn't mean it's not there.
So, why are you telling me this?
[man] I'm talking about a blood and guts, in the streets, kill or be killed race war.
I have information about a truck accident outside D.C. last night, involving classified, radioactive material.
But now the FBI is trying to cover it all up.
Why?
Because something big is happening, and it's bigger than 9/11, and it's bigger than Oklahoma City.
So be warned, be armed, and be ready.
His name is Dallas Wolf.
He gets 20,000 listeners a night.
We believe he's based just outside of D.C., but almost nobody knows him personally.
But, I have an informant, a skinhead in a gang.
And the leader of that gang is friends with Wolf.
So, I need someone to get in there, and get close to him.
Right, and I'm trying to tell you that this is not my thing!
I barely passed the PFT!
What do you think undercover work is?
Beating guys up and shooting at them?
No, it's people skills.
It's controlling situations.
It's this.
Seriously?
This is the only undercover training you'll ever need.
I saw you with that Muslim kid.
You got most of this going on anyway.
Look, I read your file.
High IQ, great people skills, but, not your typical FBI profile.
Introverted, an outsider, unhappy childhood.
Single mother, always moving around a lot, always the new kid, bullied at school, no close friends or...
Okay, okay, okay, fuck you!
That's... this is an invasion.
What gives you the right to look around...
Because we don't have time to dick around here!
You don't smuggle a boatload of cesium into the country and then just let it fucking sit there!
Fine, but I'm trying to tell you, I don't have the skills for this!
I can't even defend myself!
You do have the skills, and they mean you will never have to!
What did you say to that kid?
"You want to change things, so nobody has to suffer the way you did."
[man] A dirty bomb is any kind of crude, explosive device that, when detonated, disperses radiation around and beyond the blast.
[woman] What you would do is irradiate a large territory.
Some of these things have a half-life of 30 years.
[man] In many cases, this material cannot be seen, it can not be smelled, cannot be felt, cannot be tasted.
[man 2] The more technically capable an adversary is the more likely they would be to find ways to spread the radioactive material over larger areas.
[woman 2] One of things that we've been taught in recent years is that we must be able to prepare for the unthinkable.
[man 3] A terrorist cell smuggling weapons of mass destruction into the country in a shipping container.
[many voices overlapping]
[woman] An American Hiroshima.
[stutters] Are you out of your fucking mind?
Do you know how management looks at undercover, Nate?
You think this office is bad?
They'll have you chasing pedophiles on an Indian reservation.
I just want to discuss the option, sir.
Discuss the option?
Of what, of killing your whole career?
[Dallas] In the beginning was the word.
When the word found us we were unconscious.
But the word awakened us.
It made us conscious.
Our enemies were everywhere.
Our eyes were opened.
And they were filled with shame.
We have been violated, betrayed, and humiliated.
For we had allowed this to happen.
And so the word spoke to us, and told us to stand up!
To take back what had been stolen from us!
To fight for race, soil, and honor!
[Tom] Do you know what they do to informants, Nate?
You know what a "necktie" is?
They slit your throat, and they pull your tongue right out through it?
- Oh, shut the fuck up!
- [Tom] Oh, what, so you want him to go in blind, so he has no idea what he's getting into?
- You're just trying to manipulate him!
- Oh, and you're not?
You do whatever the fuck you want.
But you better think long and hard about this.
[Zamparo] The Turner Diaries, it's sold over a half a million copies.
Who do you think is buying it?
Eric Rudolph, the Olympic Bomber, Wade Page, who shot up the Sikh Temple.
Larry Ford, developing typhoid and cholera.
Liam Krar, with the Cyanide Bomb, anthrax, ricin, botulism, C-4, IED's,
I could go on like this for hours.
And all of them are white supremacists.
[Nate] My name is Nate Thomas.
I was in the Marines for three years, on a WMD squad in Iraq.
But, I saw a lot of things over there that changed me.
- And I'm startin' to wonder...
- No.
My name is Nate Thomas.
[Nate] I was in the Marines for three years, on a WMD squad in Iraq.
But, I saw a lot of things over there that changed me.
I started to wonder what was really going on in this country.
And now I'm back home... trying to make a new start.
I'm starting to figure out the truth about some things.
There's really only a handful of people who know what's going on.
But I want to be one of them.
And I want to make a difference.
Okay.
Not bad.
What else?
What's this?
It's my 00-214.
I was up all night Photoshop-ing it, so if anyone wants to see proof of my service in the Marines, they can just...
What the fuck are you doing?
No.
No, no, no.
Listen to me.
If you get yourself in a situation where you have to show somebody your DD-214, then you're already done.
You understand?
Good.
Now what else?
Lone extremism is not a social phenomena, it's a tactic.
Terrorists call it Leaderless Resistance.
The leaders of the movement provide inspiration, but they also encourage hidden cells act independently like, Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols.
Principle number 3:
Arouse in the other person an eager want.
So, what do they want from you?
My loyalty?
I'm loyal, I'm dedicated to the the cause.
No.
Any thug can be loyal.
What do you have...
What the guys with the cesium...
are gonna want?
Welcome to MedVale Medical Supply Company.
My military contacts helped me start this business.
Most of our sales are online.
Our radiotherapy products are specifically designed for the handling and storing of radioactive material.
So... we can acquire sensitive materials and hide them.
[Zamparo] His name is Frank Hedges.
He's been a Cl for two years.
He's in a gang called the Panzer Strike Force, and the leader of the gang is this guy.
[Zamparo] Vince Sargent.
He's friends with Dallas Wolf.
So, Vince and Dallas Wolf are tight?
Yeah, I told you, Vince calls into Wolf's show every week.
[Zamparo] So, Frank brings you into the gang, you hang out, get some credibility, you make these guys like you.
You get close to Vince.
Then, you use him to get to know Wolf.
[Frank] This is my friend Nate I was telling you about.
Hey, everybody.
14/88, brother.
Good to meet you.
All right, spread 'em.
Roy does our security.
Okay, fine.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Hey, what the fuck is that?
- What's what?
- That!
Under your fucking shirt there!
What is that?
Hey, are you a cop?
Hey, look me in my fucking eyes, boy!
Are you a fucking cop?
- No, I'm not.
- No?
[laughing]
He's fine.
Sorry about that, Nate.
But you know how it is.
- Yeah, absolutely.
- Whoa, whoa.
Have a seat.
You drink Bud?
Uh, yeah, absolutely.
Frank tells me you were in Iraq.
Yeah, three years in the Corps.
- You kill anybody?
- Johnny!
He's Johnny.
He's a... he's a fresh cut.
We're trying to teach him the ropes.
I know the fuckin' ropes, man.
Yeah?
Then mind your fucking manners!
So, did you?
Kill anybody?
- I don't talk about that.
- [scoffs]
What... what I did see was a lot of our guys go down.
Good guys... friends.
And for what?
I was on a WMD squad, the whole reason we were there, except we didn't find shit, did we?
So then I get home, I started listening to Dallas Wolf.
Oh, yeah?
Dallas and I go way back.
Oh, there's a guy I'd love to meet, you know.
He's somebody who's telling the truth.
He's out there, he's asking, why were we there?
And the answer's always the same.
Iraq, 9/11, Osama bin Laden, what does it all come back to?
Look at every war we've ever been in.
How many white men slaughtered their brothers in World War ll?
What, like a 100 million?
And for who?
Who's always pulling the strings?
It's all here in front of us.
But most people are blind.
Look at this bottle.
You see anything funny?
You're talking about the Jew tax?
What's the Jew tax?
Tell 'em, Nate.
Start looking at the food you buy, you'll see this little
The Union of Orthodox Rabbis gets paid to perform a "blessing" on everything in the grocery store.
For this "blessing," they rake in billions of dollars in taxes.
We can't control the ketchup, but we can control the streets.
That's how it went down in Germany.
And we think of ourselves as a Sturmabteilung.
We are a thinking man's soldiers.
First here.
And then here.
And that is where the revolution starts.
We're not these tired old KKK guys, waiting for some catastrophe to start a race war.
- We're the catastrophe.
- That's fucking right.
And we need guys like you, with military backgrounds.
[scoffs]
We need best practices in our security.
Come on, man, I think our fucking security is pretty good.
Well, always room to improve, though, right?
Oh, yeah?
Like What?
Well, like, look at the position of this booth and then tell me, without looking, where the nearest exits are.
- What's your point?
- The point is, of all the large booths in this restaurant, you picked the one farthest from the exits.
If something goes down, we're fucked.
No, we're ready for whatever goes down.
Yeah, with only you and him,
I don't know your name yet, I'm sorry, carrying?
Oh, and how the fuck you think you know that?
When you pat someone down so they're facing everybody's lap, it's pretty easy to tell.
You spend three years in Iraq, you learn how to scan a room.
And see threats.
Well, isn't that fucking impressive.
Now I only got one question for you.
What?
Why are you wearing Levis?
Levis?
Your fucking Jew jeans?
Yeah, no, sorry, I just couldn't help notice when I was patting' you down.
While you were doing your little detective work all up in everybody's lap.
So, why are you wearing them?
Because when I got home from Iraq, my brother gave me these jeans...
as a homecoming gift.
Now, does he understand the struggle we're in?
No.
But I'm sure as shit not gonna let a Zionist conglomerate keep me from wearing them.
You wanna boycott the Jews?
You ever look at the Fortune 500?
You'll be living in a fucking cave.
[chuckling]
He's right.
Shit...
they probably own this place, too.
[rock music plays inside]
Frank tells me you run a medical supply company now?
Yeah.
Yeah, my military contacts helped me set up.
We're just starting out, but we got access to a lot of stuff.
That's great.
I'd love to talk to you about that sometime.
Yeah... anytime.
You know, when I was... when I was 13, I actually, I played soccer.
One day, I came into the locker room, right?
And there were these six niggers, and they had this friend of mine, this Irish kid, down in the stalls, right?
His head was up against the toilet, and his face was just covered,
I mean, covered in blood, like flaps of skin.
I'd never seen anyone get beaten like that?
And when I came in, they just...
stared at me.
They stared, and I...
I walked away... and ju... just left him.
I hated those motherfuckers.
Yeah, when I was your age, I got pushed around a lot.
- Yeah?
- It fucking sucks.
But you can use that.
Yeah, but with these guys, nobody can do shit to me.
I learned to be proud.
Strong!
- Yeah, but...
- To be an Aryan fucking warrior!
- Isn't that right, Johnny?
[laughing]
All right, so what, are we gonna stand around all night
- or we gonna get fucking drunk!
- Let's go!
Come on, junior, let's get some fucking beer, motherfucker!
Come on, boy!
[laughing]
Get in there, boy!
Hey, Nate, you know what, man?
Everybody seems to really fucking like you.
Yeah.
[Frank] This is my friend, Nate, I was telling you about.
[Nate] Hey, everybody.
[Vince] 14/88, brother.
Good to meet you.
[Roy] All right, spread 'em!
[Vince] Roy does our security.
[Roy] To be an Aryan fucking warrior!
Isn't that right, Johnny?
[Dallas] Something big is happening.
In the beginning was the word.
Be armed and be ready.
[banging on door]
- [Nate] Hey!
- Hey.
What's the matter, man?
You didn't hear me?
I just... uh...
You sleep well?
What's wrong?
Oh, yeah, no, we know where you live.
- Yup.
- Right.
Cool.
Yeah, so, what, you're not gonna invite us in?
Yeah, come on in.
Oh, thanks, man, so sweet of you.
It's a... mess, sorry.
[groans]
Welcome.
You mind?
Yeah, it's a cool place, man.
Yeah, but it...
kind of looks like you just moved in.
So, what are you guys doing here?
Aw...
Don't break my heart.
What are we doing here?
[Roy] Come on, don't make it sound like you're not happy to see me.
See Vince is outside.
He's got a little surprise for you.
Oh, hey, well urn...
Yeah, well, I'm ready.
Let's go.
You're gonna be psyched, man!
It's fucking awesome!
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Cool, well, I'm good to go.
Let's head out.
- Let's go, Roy.
- What's the rush?
[sniffs]
I'm coming.
What the fuck?
What the fuck is that?
[laughing]
Goddamn, man, you got some fucking shitty-ass furniture up in here, huh?
Yep.
Cheap as shit.
- All right, you ready?
- Yeah, I'm ready.
- Sieg Heil, motherfucker, let's go.
- Sieg fucking Heil.
[Zamparo] You didn't finish your transcript.
[Nate] Yeah, I know, I'll get to it.
Look at my fucking arm!
[Zamparo] And what the fuck is going on with this guy Roy?
You make him look small, you make him into an enemy.
Sometimes, Angela, it would just be great to hear, "Good job."
I'm only so hard on you because I'm trying to protect you.
You have to remember your objective here.
This is about getting to Dallas Wolf.
So what do I do about that?
Try relating to these guys as human beings.
You know?
Open up to them, if you can.
You may have more in common with them than you think.
[Roy] Man, why the fuck does Vince make us come to this shit?
"Good networking, lots of movement guys." I mean, who gives a fuck?
[Nate] Well, is Dallas Wolf gonna be here?
[Roy] Who the fuck knows?
I don't listen to that talk radio bullshit.
[Nate] Fuck!
[laughing]
Goddamn.
Hey, that looks good on you, man.
Yeah, thanks.
Just go in, I got another shirt in the cargo.
[phone clicks] [dialing]
Hi, you must be Vince's friend, Nate!
- I'm Becky, Gerry's wife.
- Oh, hi, nice to meet you.
- Such a pleasure to have you.
- Thank you for having me.
Yeah, of course.
Hey, Nate, I made some cupcakes.
The frosting is a little messed up, but they taste good.
[man] So, Dallas, we wanted...
Nate!
Come check this out.
[man] ls it true, this Dallas Wolf Unity Rally is the largest event you've hosted in years?
[Dallas] Absolutely.
We've brought together the biggest white separatist organizations in the Northeast.
And we're also having a conference, with some of the world's preeminent racial scholars.
But let me get something straight.
You have all your permits, you have all your licenses, and yet this AFL, the Anti-Fascist League,
John, can we get the graphic?
[interviewer] They're planning on viciously attacking peaceful demonstrators with hockey sticks and D batteries and urine balloons.
Not only that.
They're busing in hundreds of protesters from the D.C. area.
But all I can say is, the AFL better be careful.
Because while we come in peace, we're certainly not afraid of war.
Fuck.
Yeah.
God, that's the first I'm hearing about this rally.
I mean, God knows you can't get any real news on the Yidivision, but still...
Are you planning on going, Nathan?
And this is Andrew Blackwell from the Aryan Alliance.
- Hail Victory, brother.
- Hail Victory.
The Aryan Alliance, huh?
I've read a lot about you guys.
Well, we're the premiere white nationalist group in the world, so, that's not surprising.
[man] Earnest Walton, Grand Dragon, good to meet you.
Good to meet you.
Earnest is with the local Klan.
Yeah, you should stop by one of our meetings.
- We'd love to have you.
- [Nate] Oh, wow.
You should check out our website, too.
We're always looking for quality people.
I don't think Nate's into all that religious stuff.
Excuse me?
Religious stuff?
I just think Nate is a little more rational than that.
I'm not sure I know what you mean by that.
Come on, Nate.
Let's go back and get some food.
Stay away from those faggots.
They got this fucked up religion where they think the Bible was written for white men and Aryans are the lost tribes of Israel.
The Bible.
Jews invented Christianity.
Jews invented the printing press, and the Bible is the most published book in the world.
I mean, anything seem off to you?
How about the fact the Romans conquered every mud race on earth, and then Christianity finished them off in a hundred years?
You gotta know who to stick with in this movement.
You're with us.
Goddamn it, Vince, every time we come here, the whole fuckin' place is dry!
- What the fuck, man?
- It's two hours, be good.
Gerry, there's somebody I want you to meet.
This is Nate.
- Hey, Gerry Conway.
- Nate Thomas, nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.
Vince told me all about you.
Make yourself at home.
I am throwing on some veggie burgers.
Thanks for having us.
- Hi!
- Hey, hey, I'm Nate.
- Madeline.
Nice to meet you.
- Hey, Madeline.
- This is Timmy.
- Hey, Timmy.
You want to come see our tree house?
Yeah, sure, where are we going?
Oh, right, yeah, there.
Oh, wow, that is great!
Did your Dad build this?
- I built it!
- You built this?
- But my Daddy helped.
- Okay.
Wow.
- It's to protect us.
- Yeah, from what?
If the mud people come.
Always be ready.
Always be watchful and stick together.
- You guys kidnapping my guest?
Huh?
Huh?
- [kids screaming]
This is amazing, man.
Well, I've always been good with my hands.
And it was just wonderful to have a project with the kids.
You know how you spell love, Nate?
T-I-M-E.
Ninety percent of the time you'll ever spend with your kids
- comes before the age of 12.
- Wow.
Yeah.
You been in the movement long, Nate?
Not long.
Just since I got back from Iraq.
Oh, yeah, right.
Yeah, Vince told me you served.
Hey, Nate, don't take this the wrong way but you kind of seem a little mature for a skinhead.
- [chuckles] Really?
- Yeah.
Yeah, maybe.
I don't know.
What about you?
You seem to know a lot of people in this movement.
They probably come for the free food.
You have these barbecues often?
Yeah, as much as I can, yes, you know,
I try to create a positive environment for everybody in the community, and a place for us to come together and be
- [Roy and Johnny arguing] - healthy in body and spirit.
"Fuck you, bitch!" And he turned around, and he's like...
Guys!
Guys!
Language, please.
Kids.
Jesus fucking Christ.
[scoffs]
It makes me so sad to see those two.
They gotta clean up their act.
Well, how do you mean?
Well, the cigarettes, and alcohol, the language.
And this is what's happening to our young Aryan men.
Yeah.
To be honest, now that I met you,
I'm kind of surprised you invited those guys.
Well, you can't exclude them.
I mean, they're the next generation.
They need our help.
Need to understand their heritage, and be proud of it.
That's what it's all about, isn't it?
The children.
What kind of a world will they grow up in?
Goddamn, man, that was the worst fucking party on earth.
[groans] Jesus Christ, what kind of bullshit vodka is this, man?
Man, that's the last time I ever let you pick it out.
Man, look at that shit.
Look at that!
That is just fucking...
God, that is so fucking awful!
Man, look at that, look at that beautiful, Aryan woman and that fucking...
Roy, come on, let's go the fuck home.
No.
No, man, we're gonna teach these two a lesson.
- No!
- Get your fucking hands off of me!
Don't you ever fucking touch me again.
You hear me?
We're Aryan warriors, right?
That means we got a responsibility to do something about shit like this.
Hey, you two!
You need to get the fuck out of here!
Hold on, what did you say?
I said, get the fuck out of here or we're gonna kill you, you fucking spic!
- What the fuck is your problem?
- What's our problem?
You come into our country, you fuck our women.
Yeah, you got some big fucking balls, huh?
Put the fucking knife down and calm down, all right, man?
- They get the point.
- You thought you were a big man, huh?
He gets it, Roy!
He's fucking shaking.
I thought you were a big man!
- Put the fucking knife down!
- Fuck you, motherfucker!
I'll fucking gut you, you piece of shit!
Now go, fucker!
- [screaming] - [alarm blaring]
- Come on, let's go!
- Shit!
Fuck, Nate.
Goddamn it!
You're fucking lucky!
What the fuck is your problem?
You fucked the whole thing up!
Yeah, I think they got the message, Roy!
Got the message?
Are you a fucking idiot?
Man, those two were mine!
And then your dumb fucking ass decides...
Hang on, wait a minute...
first you tried to stop me, then you try to scare them off, and then you set off that fucking alarm.
That wasn't an accident, was it?
Was it, Nate?
You wanted them to get away.
What the fuck, Nate?
Huh?
I said what the fuck?
Okay, you're goddamn right I wanted them to get away!
You want to be a soldier, Roy and not a fucking thug?
Then think!
You think about security cameras, Roy?
You think about the liquor store we were just in?
You think about the clerk or the license plates on my fucking truck?
You think about any of that shit?
[Nate] Fucking Aryan warrior...
A hundred spics and niggers ain't worth the life of one white man, but go ahead, put us all in prison.
That's how you're gonna win your race war?
Huh?
Fuck!
All right, whatever, can we just get back on the road and get the fuck out of here?
!
Fuck!
[Zamparo] I ran those license plates.
An accountant, a school teacher, a lawyer, fireman, he's an engineer, not a criminal record in sight, but Andrew Blackwell, he's a different story.
Why is he here?
He said he was going to Wolf's rally.
He's the National Director of the Aryan Alliance.
They're based in Ohio, he wouldn't just come all this way to be in a rally.
Wait, if Wolf is involved in this, he can't be doing it alone, right?
I mean, he'd need help, and organization.
Exactly, so you need to figure out how Wolf and Blackwell are connected, and why he's really here.
[chatter]
- Vince, good to see you.
- Welcome brother.
Rich, can we get some literature, please?
- White power.
- White power.
Okay, we're gettin' ready to get started here.
Can everyone take a seat?
[Dallas] Most times I talk to you,
I focus on our survival, the terrible struggle to save our people before they are lost forever.
But what about the future?
What do we dream of?
What is the world we wish to build?
I'll tell you.
It will be a world like the one that shaped our race in Europe.
A world of forests, mountains, and lakes.
Not a world of concrete, asphalt, and garbage.
And instead of 300 million race-less mulattos, breeding and infesting.
Imagine a continent of 50 million white Europeans.
Smarter, stronger, healthier, noble men and women, living and working together in harmony and unity.
That's the world I see.
That's what keeps me strong.
That's the nation we can build...
together.
[applause]
If you take millions of white people, and flood every country in Africa with them, what do they call that?
[Dallas] Genocide.
But what's happening to every white country on earth?
You've got affirmative action, that kills white jobs.
Abortion, that kills white babies.
Gay rights, that kill white families.
Folks, let me explain something to you.
"Diversity" is a code word.
And what it means is white genocide!
[cheering]
So, we'll begin marching at the courthouse.
And after two blocks...
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
This is not the order that we agreed to.
Aryan Alliance is supposed to be heading this march.
[man] Just a second, Andrew.
You know, we're at this rally every year, and we start with the Colonial Patriots.
[Andrew] Well, this isn't "every year," is it?
To be fair, Harris, maybe we should.
You're a local organization...
Vince?
Can you introduce me to Dallas?
"The Klan"?
You guys aren't "The Klan."
Yeah, sure.
Come on, let's go.
You're the "Invisible White Knights" of the Ku Klux Klan!
Which is what, the third Klan group in the D.C. metro area?
!
Hey, Dallas!
Good to see you.
It's... it's Vince, Vince Sargent?
Right, Vince.
Good to see you.
Good to see you.
I want to introduce you to my good friend, this is Nate Thomas.
- I'm a huge fan of your show.
- Thank you, sir.
If you'll excuse me, I have to get ready for the march.
[indistinct chatter]
- Uh, Mr. Wolf?
- Yes, what is it?
I didn't want to get into this in front of Vince, but I'd like to talk to you about an investment.
- An "investment"?
- Mm-hm.
I represent a few people who are big fans of yours, and they want to help.
- Is that so?
- Yes, sir.
They have a number of assets in the online media space, and they feel the potential for your show is being limited by your advertising budget.
They want to help you penetrate some new markets, and they see no reason why you can't go nationwide.
Well, that is great, son.
That is just great.
Here, call this number and we'll talk.
Okay, great.
That sounds great, Mr. Wolf.
- Call me, Dallas.
- Thank you.
[protestors] Racist scum!
Racist bum!
Racist scum...
We're here today because we're proud of our race!
We love our race!
And we're here to say that.
- White power!
- [all] White power!
The white race is under attack in this country.
- [Andrew] White rights!
- [all] White rights!
But nobody seems to give a damn!
- [Andrew] White freedom!
- [all] White freedom!
[protestors yelling indistinct]
- Where's Al Sharpton?
- [man] Fuckin' rednecks!
Where's Jesse Jackson to fight for white rights!
- White power!
- [all] White power!
White equality!
- [Andrew] White pride!
- [all] White pride!
If you're white, and you are standing over there...
- [Andrew] White freedom!
- [all] White freedom!
You're on the wrong side of that barricade!
- [Andrew] White rights!
- [all] White rights!
Nate!
[Dallas] Wake up, white people!
Wake up!
- [Andrew] White power!
- [all] White power!
It's morning in America and there's a new day coming.
- Nate!
What are you doing, man?
- Shut the fuck up, nigger!
[Dallas] Come join your race!
That's some fucker that works in my building.
[Dallas] Come join the white race!
[all] White race!
- [Andrew] White power!
- [all] White power!
[crowd] Racist bum!
Racist scum!
Racist burn!
It's the fucking AFL.
Yeah, don't worry, they won't do shit.
Well, well, well, if it isn't the American Fucking Losers!
[all yelling]
Yeah, fuck you!
Why don't you come over the fucking barricade, motherfuckers!
Johnny!
Hey, man, just fucking stay back, okay?
- Don't fucking do it.
- I gotta help him.
Help him by not getting the fuck arrested, okay?
- Fucking pussies!
- [man] White Nazi scum!
Yeah, you know what?
I can do that shit, too.
I'm gonna fucking kill you, motherfucker!
- Do not engage.
Do not engage.
- [man] You think I'm playing around?
I'm gonna fucking kill you!
Get your hands off of me!
I'm gonna kill these motherfuckers!
Stay back!
- White power!
- [all] White power!
- White pride!
- [all] White pride!
You fucking motherfucker.
I'm gonna fucking kill you!
He hit me in the fucking eye!
It's fucking piss!
- Johnny!
- [yelling continues]
[Nate] Andrew!
Can you walk?
[groaning] [engine starts]
[whispers] Get the fuck outta here.
You okay?
Everyone okay?
- [Andrew groans]
- Sorry.
Okay.
Stay with us.
I'm getting you out of here, man.
- Go... go right, go right!
- Mm-hm.
Oh, fuck!
- Fuck!
- Fucking...
- [honking horn]
- Holy shit!
Fucking go!
Fuck!
We gotta go!
We gotta fucking go!
[indistinct yelling]
I can't fucking go anywhere!
Stay down!
[tires screeching]
Fuck!
[panting]
No, don't get up.
You need to rest.
I brought you some chamomile tea.
It'll help you relax.
Thank you.
There's our wounded warrior.
How you feeling, buddy?
Yeah, much better.
Thank you, guys.
No problem.
Let me put some music on.
I brought you Sammy to keep you company.
Thanks.
- [orchestral music plays] - [Nate] Oh, wow.
You like it?
I...
I love Brahms.
See, Becky, I knew he was quality.
I think the fourth is my favorite.
Yeah, mine, too.
Except maybe the...
- The first?
- [chuckles] Yeah.
Now listen, if you like Brahms,
I've got this Clarinet Quintet that will blow your mind.
They're dead, Gerry.
Dead.
I'm gonna find them, and we're gonna string them up...
Okay, guy, I hear ya, I hear ya.
That's... that's why I avoid the political stuff.
Not my thing.
Besides, I've heard it can be dangerous.
[both chuckling]
That was fantastic.
Thank you...
I thought you guys were vegetarians.
Everybody's gotta have a few vices every now and then.
- [phone buzzing]
- What's "vices"?
[chuckling] Oh, boy, there we go!
I'm sorry about that, that's my ride.
Gerry, Becky, thanks for everything.
Nathan, I don't know what to say.
I owe you, big time.
Why don't you stop by the compound some time.
Oh, I'm not really in Ohio that much, but I'd love to if I ever am.
No, I meant the... the new one.
- Oh.
- Here in Virginia.
Oh, right, yeah, please, I'd love to.
- Bye.
- Have a good night.
Bye, Andrew!
Well, listen, you're not going to believe it, but when it comes to Tchaikovsky...
gotta go with Bernstein.
- Leonard Bernstein?
- I know, I know.
Gerry, I hate to break it to you, man...
I know.
Listen, I can't help it, he's a great conductor.
Jews listen to Wagner, don't they?
So, Gerry, if you don't mind my asking, how did you end up in the movement?
Listen, for me, it was the books.
My parents were practically liberals.
Totally blinded by the ZOG.
You know, I always knew something...
was wrong.
And...
I had this anger,
I couldn't put my finger on it, until... here.
It all started with this.
I was 13.
Read it in four days.
It explains race, culture, capitalism... how democracy destroyed Western civilization.
Democracy:
"Three people form a government.
Then two of them vote to steal the wealth of the third."
- David Lane, right?
- Mm-hm.
Now here's something more recent.
You'll love this.
[Gerry] This breaks down the entire worldwide Zionist conspiracy,
- step by step.
You can bring it back.
- [Nate] Oh, no, I couldn't.
Nate, Nate, please.
But that was it?
I mean, it was just books woke you up?
Well, you know, I had my theories.
And then a three-month engineering contract opened up in Kenya.
I was young, I wanted to see the world.
And...
Nate, listen,
I got no problem with them having their own country, everybody should.
But if you go there, and you see, they...
they weren't even living like animals.
You know, animals don't live in their own feces, do they?
So, if you ever have any doubt white men created civilization, just go have a look.
[Nate] Hey.
[Zamparo] So, how was the Brahms?
[Nate] How do you reason with someone like that?
How can you ever hope to change their mind?
[Zamparo] Listen, you need to remember why you're doing this.
We're not social workers...
[Nate] You wanted me to relate to them as human beings, right?
"Open up to them?" you said.
[Gerry] ...they weren't even living like animals.
[Zamparo] You wanna get a drink?
[Nate] Where are we gonna go and get a drink?
[Nate and Angela laughing]
[Zamparo] This suspect, he was a fucking nightmare.
He was grabbing my ass, the whole thing.
And he kept insisting I go to this club with him, where I knew he was gonna make his big move, but, if I didn't go, then, you know, I could blow my whole cover.
So, what did you do?
So, we're at a bar, and I tell him I want oysters.
So, I get a dozen, I start plowing through them.
Then I start acting queasy.
I run to the bathroom, stick my finger down my throat.
- No way!
- Yeah!
So now there's puke all over my dress,
I tell him I got sick off the oysters and take a cab home.
Two days later, he was arrested.
- That is fucking awesome.
- Oh, it was fucked up.
But there was the thrill, you know?
That high?
God, there's nothing like it.
Yeah, so Why'd you stop?
It was just... it's no way to live, the paranoia, the tension.
And I wanted to spend more time with my kids.
You got kids?
You don't think I'm mommy material?
No, no... no.
Yeah, I got two princesses.
Mommy and Daddy.
Perfect, little suburban life.
Anyway, I know how lonely this work can be.
But the case won't go forever.
You can't change the way people think, but you are making a difference.
Nathan, good to see you.
Can we get you anything, coffee?
Oh, no, I'm good, thanks.
- This is a great set-up you got here.
- Yeah, thanks.
All right, let's give you the tour.
This parcel is actually pretty small, but we're purchasing the one next to it.
Although, citizen's groups are trying to block us out.
Oh, yeah.
How are you handling that?
Well, we tell them we're here to stay.
Make no mistake about it.
We show up at their homes, their businesses, their churches.
They backed down pretty quick after that.
So you're moving the national headquarters?
No, we're keeping the compound in Ohio, it's just with...
everything going on right now, we needed a stronger presence here.
You know?
- Is that your firing range?
- Yeah, come on.
It's a little primitive, but we're working on it.
I'm no marksman, by any means, but I have some expertise in range design, just from training the Iraqi police.
What's your danger area template?
To contain your cone of fire.
I mean, how do you control your overshoot?
We haven't gotten to that yet.
Okay, well, you might want to make sure it's the kikes and niggers getting hit and not your guys.
Absolutely.
Maybe if you have time,
- you could talk to the guys about it.
- Yeah, sure,
I need to see what kind of equipment you've got, but I'm happy to.
Okay... come on up here.
Right now were just using this for storage.
- Are those cots?
- Yup.
We'll be able to sleep 200 in there.
And we're gonna need to.
I'm not gonna beat around the bush.
You see the type of organization we have here, but we could always use a man like you, Nathan.
Educated, war veteran, clean record.
I mean, hell, you don't even have any parking tickets.
Yeah, we have our contacts in law enforcement, local, state, federal, not to mention military hospitals, laboratories, you name it.
And so what's the overall objective here?
I mean, are you just trying to get the message out, or what?
Get the... get the message out?
To who?
We're not trying to recruit the public here.
What would we do with them?
They're at home sitting on their asses,
- watching sitcoms and surfing Facebook.
- [chuckles]
This is revolutionary activity we're talking about here.
Look, I'm flattered by the interest, but... you know,
I've been the movement awhile now, and a lot of these guys are all talk.
Now for me to really want to get involved,
I need to know there's bigger things going on here.
No offense.
Yeah... none taken.
All right...
Take a look at this.
This is the entire D.C. water system.
Plants, pipelines, the whole deal.
Now, Nathan, the guys you're hanging outwith, they're all talk, because they're punks.
They're amateurs.
They sit around drinking beer all day, maybe they beat up a few niggers or each other.
We got no use for 'em.
We need men like you.
Can I help you?
I'm looking for Dallas Wolf, but I must have the wrong house.
Oh, no, he's here.
Come in.
Randy!
Someone's here!
Hey, Nate.
The studio's back here.
I'm moving studios right now, so, this is all temporary.
Oh, no, this is a great setup.
Thanks for taking the time to see me, Dallas.
I just spent the afternoon with Andrew at the Aryan Alliance.
Oh, yeah?
Andrew's great.
They have an incredible organization.
Yeah, they seem really serious about the struggle.
About doing whatever it takes.
They're true patriots, those guys.
Well, let me give you a bit of background on me.
I was in Iraq for three years, on a WMD squad.
And then when I got back, my military contacts helped me set up a medical supply company.
V-A-L-E.
Wow, this is great.
Yeah, we do it all, from bandages and syringes to x-ray and radiotherapy equipment.
And with the highly regulated stuff, we can cut through a lot of the red tape and deal directly, and discreetly.
Fantastic, Nate.
Great to know.
So... you'd also mentioned an investment?
For the show?
Yes, I've got an investor lined up who's very excited about expanding your reach.
We're talking advertising, marketing, bigger servers...
That's exactly what I need.
So how do I meet him?
Well, a lot of my military contacts don't like to publicize their efforts.
But he'd love for you to put together a proposal about how you'd expand the show.
Funny you should mention that.
I've been trying to raise $7,500 to break into the Florida market.
They're ripe right now, with all the immigration stuff.
Yeah...
Yeah, this is great!
So, there's one more thing.
[Dallas] Go ahead, shoot.
The reason he's helping you is because he feels that you are a man of action.
As he is.
As I am.
Right, sure.
So for him to move forward, he needs to know you're serious about this.
Nate, I've been ready to give my life for this cause for 20 years now.
What I need is the right people behind me.
So you tell your investor, that if he wants action, he's got the right guy.
Sorry, Dallas, I've got kind of a long drive back, you mind if I hit the head?
[door shuts]
The whole case is about to blow wide open!
He's in with Wolf, he's in with the Aryan Alliance.
Yeah, and all we need to keep Wolf on the line is that $7,500!
Let me get this straight.
So after everything we spent on your cover, even after the medical supply business, you want me to ask for $7,500 as an "investment" in this guy's radio show?
You're the only one with a budget right now!
Oh, yeah, I'm just flush with cash!
I'm trying to run a 40-man investigation on top of all the shit I've already got!
Sir, the Alliance is building a compound outside D.C..
Wolf's house is setting off a Geiger counter!
I spent six hours last night reading your transcripts,
Nate, you don't have shit!
[Torn] You don't have shit!
Look at how much carbon is built up on this bolt.
- See?
See that?
Like...
- Yeah.
That's unacceptable.
When's the last time you cleaned this?
I've been meaning to get to most of them.
Okay, guys, seriously!
Okay, so we got an AR-15, serial number A00724, needs a new buffer spring.
Come on, guys, let's go!
We need to go through the whole inventory.
Andrew's waiting on this.
I'm gonna have to tell Andrew, the only way it's gonna change is with new policies.
[Andrew] And how do I know it's not me you're trying to fuck?
[Vince] Fuck you, you calling us liars?
[Roy] You get on the phone yourself!
Call them up and ask them...
Hey, guys...
Hey, Nate...
it's been a while.
Yeah, you kinda disappeared on us.
I'm sorry about that, Vince.
Been kind of busy.
[Roy chuckles] Yeah, I bet you have.
Seems like you made a bunch of new friends around here, huh?
See, we were just wondering if maybe you could explain...
Roy!
Thanks for stopping by.
Be seeing you, Nate.
What was all that about?
Roy says the police have been following him.
He's paranoid about infiltrators.
Infiltrators, huh?
Yeah.
That's why the police are on his ass?
Have you seen how that guy behaves?
It's a miracle he's not in jail already.
Right.
You want to help us with something?
Sure, what's up?
I'm throwing a youth event for Hitler's birthday.
There's a campground a couple miles from here.
- Help us scout it.
- Sounds good.
It's amazing how much land there is right outside D.C.
[laughing]
Let me ask you something, Nathan.
What's your opinion on infiltration?
Well, how do you mean?
How do we prevent it?
Well, it's tough.
For one thing, you gotta keep guys with rap sheets out of important positions.
That's...
That's how they flip most people.
We have a polygraph back at the compound.
Maybe we should make everybody take it.
I mean, I think someone who's trained can beat a polygraph without blinking.
Yeah, maybe we should just do background checks for everybody.
Get everyone's records and documents together?
Yeah, I mean, for informants, that might work.
But for law enforcement, they just forge whatever they need.
Yeah, but with a few phone calls, you know, a cover only runs so deep.
Do you suspect someone?
It's like they say at these rallies.
You look to the left, look to the right, ya' know, one of these people is a snitch.
It's the left.
Turn left right up here.
[Andrew] You okay there, Nate?
You look a little off?
No, I'm good.
Just... tired... been a long day.
Well, I think this is a great location.
What do you think?
Yeah, I like it.
Well, what about the permits, though?
Tell them we're a Christian organization, holding a youth event.
I gotta ask you something.
Roy said he contacted the NPRC.
Said there's no record of you having served in the Marines.
You mean Roy went and filed a 180 with a government that he fucking hates, just to... okay.
I was on a WMD squad, so that's black ops.
And he knows that.
Fucker.
Wait, hold on, are you guys taking this seriously?
Is that what that was all about in the truck?
Because, I understand you have to do your due diligence or whatever, but that's a fucking serious accusation!
I don't need to take that shit from anybody!
- Hey.
Hey.
Hey, hey, hey!
- Least of all from-
Okay.
Let's get out of here.
[Zamparo] Nate, listen.
We need to get the serial numbers first, and then...
No, look, I don't have time for that!
What if he wasn't convinced?
What if he calls Wolf?
The account name is Nate Foster, please.
You don't know if he was convinced!
You don't even know if they talk, okay?
You're being...
Yeah, I'd like $7,500 in cash.
You're a man of your word, which is a rare thing in this movement.
So, listen, Dallas, my investor is very excited, but he wants to know some more about what you're planning, some details.
Oh, okay, I think it was all in the presentation, but, we start with online in Tampa, and then we move down the...
- No, no, I mean, beyond that.
- Beyond Florida?
Beyond the show, like what we talked about.
The actions we're gonna take.
I'm sorry, Nate.
I lost you.
What do you mean?
What I mean is, you have been talking a lot about a lot of big things that are coming.
Bigger than Oklahoma City, bigger than 9/11...
Oh, yeah, for sure.
Which is why expanding the show is so important.
Right, and I have been spending a lot of time with Andrew at the Aryan Alliance.
He told me you'd been working together.
Well, yeah, sure, I mean, he came to the rally.
No, no, what my investor needs to know is what are
We concrete steps mat you are taking to start the race war.
As I said to you before,
I have the expertise, the connections, the tools.
Maybe there's some kind of misunderstanding.
I thought we were talking about expanding the show.
Yeah, which my investor is happy to do, but if you're not willing to be honest about the other actions you're taking, then he's not gonna be able to support you.
Okay, Nate, fair enough.
Sorry it didn't work out.
I saw the plans, Dallas, for the water system.
Andrew showed them to me, okay?
So, I know all about it, and now I just need you to stop pretending, and be honest with me.
This is private property.
You're no longer welcome here.
I'm asking you to leave.
Come on, Dallas.
I'm on your side.
Get the fuck out.
Now.
[phone buzzing]
Fuck.
[Zamparo] We're going to the office, Dallas Wolf is there.
- [Nate] You brought him in?
- [Zamparo] No.
He came to us.
[door opens]
Sir.
I didn't know you'd be here.
Has anyone talked to him?
No, no, of course not.
No, it's your show.
So, Dallas.
Or should I call you Randy?
That is your real name.
You can call me whatever you like, Agent Zamparo.
Any reason you're using an assumed name?
I'm a public entertainer.
Fine.
So, tell me why you're here today.
I'm here because of the guy I called about.
He shows up at my conference, talking about investing in my show.
But then, he's telling me how he can get highly regulated items.
And talking about plans to the water system, and threatening me!
His name is Nate Thomas, and if he does anything crazy,
I don't want to be associated with it.
Did he give you money?
- He tried to.
- How much?
- $7,500.
- Wow.
That's a lot.
- Why would he do that?
- Because he's a wacko!
[Dallas] A lot of these nutjobs approach me.
But this guy is on another level.
[Zamparo] You have no idea why you, of all people, would be approached by this guy?
[Dallas] No, Agent Zamparo, I don't.
Right.
Let me play you something, okay, Randy?
[Dallas] I have information about a truck accident
outside D.C. last night, involving classified radioactive material, but now, the FBI is trying to cover it all up.
Why?
You've gotta be kidding me.
It's a radio show.
It's entertainment!
So you think it's entertaining to predict and incite terrorist attacks?
Whether I think it's entertaining is irrelevant.
Why don't you talk to somebody around here who knows something about the law, preferably a man!
[Dallas] Brandenburg vs. Ohio, 1969, it is not illegal to advocate violence.
[Zamparo] The First Amendment doesn't protect people who have knowledge of an actual crime!
What knowledge of a crime do I have?
Well, why don't you tell me, Randy?
What is this accident?
What is this FBI cover-up?
Why are you living at an unregistered address?
And why is that location lighting up a Geiger counter?
You've been following me?
You've been casing my house?
Why don't you answer my questions?
[Dallas] Let me show you something.
Do you mind?
Help yourself.
[Dallas] From the White Action Network blog, AryanMother88 writes,
"I was driving down 301 last night, and the FBI had cordoned off an accident with hazmat tape.
I haven't seen anything on the news.
So what is the ZOG covering up?"
As for the unregistered address, I live with my mom, and I'd like to keep that private, if it's okay with you?
And your Geiger counter is lighting up because I have prostate cancer!
I know your type.
You think you've got it all figured out, and you don't know shit.
I'm an entertainer.
I do this for money, and for fun.
And I don't give a fuck about ZOG, or the race war or any of that shit.
I tell these jackasses what they want to hear, and they worship me for it.
So fuck you, Agent Zamparo.
Can you open the door, please?
[door opens]
- Now, Tom, look...
- "Now, Tom," what, "look", what?
Really, what could you possibly have to say?
Because this is a fucking disaster!
I warned you, I tried to tell you.
- We still might have a weapons case!
- We ran those serial numbers.
Every single one of those guns is legally registered.
Every one!
Okay, so you think there's nothing to any of this?
Right?
The prepaid cellphones?
The barracks for 200 guys?
- The water system plans?
- They're conspiracy theorists!
It's all talk!
He keeps those plans around to trot out when he wants to act like a big shot!
